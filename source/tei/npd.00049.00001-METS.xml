Gentlemen of the State Board of Agriculture: The swift passage of time has brought us to another year — a year to which we, as a nation, can look forward with renewed hope of success and prosperity. Truly, we can say that the past year has been the most strenuous in modern history because of the great war to which we have given our best young blood, finances and energy. As true Americans we can rejoice to know that today "Old Glory" waves over the soil of a once proud empire whose boast through four years of warfare has been that its armies fought on conquered ground. Our rejoicing over the com - ing of peace is mingled with sorrow. To the cause of right, some among us have given brothers and sons who have sacrificed their lives as de - fenders of humanity and freedom. To these bereaved ones our hearts go out in sincerest sympathy, so we pause a moment to pay reverent tribute to those brave boys who counted not their lives too dear to be offered in defence of their country from the menace of Prussian rule. Looking back over the year past, the people of Nebraska can say they have much of which they are justly proud. Government statistics show that Nebraska has long been a prominent state in the matter of producing corn, wheat, alfalfa, cattle and hogs, so it should be a matter of pride to the agricultural association to know that in regard to live - wire, up-to-the-minute fairs, our own State Fair is recognized as being in Class One, and in point of excellence and attendance holds a most en - viable place. Notwithstanding the unfavorable conditions caused by the general upheaval of our country being at war, we think we can safely say our semi-centennial Nebraska Fair was the most successful ever recorded. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 11 The work of your Association during the past year has been particu - larly gratifying from various viewpoints. Believing that a detailed ac - count of the several departments of the State Fair would be superflu - ous, since this will be fully covered in the report of the Secretary, I will touch but briefly on one or two items to which I wish to call your atten - tion. But a short time previous to the opening of the Fair, we were for - tunate in securing a reduction of railroad fares of one and one-third for the round trip which greatly increased our attendance. And almost on the eve of the opening of the Fair, we were informed of an increase of freight rates that would have severely crippled our live stock exhibits, had it not been for the efforts of the Railway Commission and the Com - mercial Club, together with the State Board of Agriculture, who exerted their united influence and succeeded in restoring the rates to their for - mer status. You all know how largely our success depends upon the exhibitors and concessionaires. It is our object to make each exhibit or concession larger and better than that of the previous year. A new exhibit which attracted deserved attention and praise for its excellence was the War Exhibit sent by the Government. Its timely display proved both inter - esting and instructive; that its worth was appreciated was attested by the crowds that constantly filled that particular section. This year saw the completion of the swine barn which was started under the able supervision of our ex-President, J. A. Ollis. Your Secre - tary and Board of Managers deserve much praise for their untiring la - bors in bringing about the erection of the present structure which is re - garded as the largest and best building of its kind to be found on any State Fair grounds in the west, and probably in the United States. The swine exhibit was unusually large, taxing the capacity of the buiiding, so we may justly congratulate ourselves over the acquirement of a structure which is a credit to the Association, and know that in its com - pletion we have attained a long-felt want. Here I would recommend further grading and the completion of the street adjacent, known as "Ollis Avenue", as already planned by the Board. I would further recommend as soon as our funds will permit the expenditure, that a suitable house be erected on the grounds as a perma - nent residence for the Secretary, whose comfort and convenience to his particular line of work will thereby be greatly facilitated. Abo, I recom - mend the erection of a horse barn on the grounds, designated for that purpose, lying north of the new swine barn. The matter of more toilets on the grounds should be arranged, also more grading and walks. We have to thank the officers of the street railway company who as - sisted us to improve the street car entrance in the matter of relaying tracks and furnishing transportation. We now have an entrance to the grounds that greatly facilitates the comfort and convenience of patrons, </seg>

To the gentlemen who co-operated with us in the improvement of trackage lines, the Board tenders thanks for generous and courteous treatment extended. Our Legislature should appropriate money sufficient to reimburse the State Board of Agriculture for the grading of the grounds and the building of the Street Railway and en - trance. A most pleasant and profitable meeting of the National AssociatioB of Fairs and Expositions at Chicago was enjoyed by your delegates, who found the interchange of views and ideas of benefit. It is most gratify - ing to us, and should be a matter of pride to Nebraskans as well, to know that our worthy Secretary, E. R. Danielson, was elected to the secretaryship of the American Association of Fairs and Expositions by a large majority, the feeling of the assembly being that they had secured the right man for the right place. Knowing Mr. Danielson as we do, I am sure you all agree with me in believing that he will bring to the position his usual energy and progressiveness, his personal in - terest and executive ability. Of the work done by my fellow members of the Board, there has been nothing to censure and much to commend. I have appreciated your loyal support and hearty co-operation, without which I should have felt my responsibility too great. We have worked together with a spirit of unity and comradeship which has been most gratifying. Es - pecially would I thank your efficient Secretary, who has so ably per - formed his duties, and who has so generously given his time, interest and energy to the upbuilding of this Association. I wish to thank all the members for the earnestness and faith - fulness with which they have sought to serve the interests of tht Board. I have found each individual ever ready to fill his respective place of duty. I thank you, one and all, for the considerate treatment which I have uniformly received. Before this meeting comes to a close, I shall have returned to you the honor conferred on me a year ago. It has been my earnest endeavor to serve the State Board of Agriculture to the best of my ability, and to uphold the honor and dignity of the office. To the incoming administration, may I hope that you will give the same loyal support and good will? Respectfully submitted, R. M. WOLCOTT.

            <seg id="p014">14 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are more familiar. I called your attention a year ago to the fact that when we entered the war against the central powers this country wag lacing an unsatisfactory situation with respect to its supply of foods and food stuffs. The production of the leading cereals for 1916 was comparatively low; adverse weather conditions curtailed the 1917 wheat crop, although the acreage planted to winter wheat in 1917 was slightly less than that for the record year of 1915. With the increased effort of the farmers of the state to comply with the request of the government for increased food supplies. Nebraska pro - duced, in general, one of the smallest crops in its history. Yet, taken as a whole, this year's crop was worth in dollars and cents perhaps more than any crop that has been produced for many years. This was due to the extremely high prices caused by the war. Had not the weather conditions been adverse throughout the whole year, Nebraska would be enjoying the greatest financial prosperity in its history. One but needs to study statistics to see the abnormal conditions ex - isting for 1918. In the face of all adverse conditions the farmers of the state have put back nearly a half million more acres to wheat for the 1919 harvest, and the condition of this crop was 98 per cent on December 1st as against 79 per cent in 1917 and a general average of 89 per cent for the past five years. Therefore, we have a right to predict a bumper crop for 1919. The farmers appreciate this condition. They are going to meet some serious problems before the 1919 harvest. Feed and roughness are scarce and it will take some serious plan - ning to carry the live stock of the state through until pastures come. During the past year a co-operative crop reporting 1 bureau has been established between the State Board of Agriculture and the crop report - ing bureau of the United States Department of Agriculture. Where prac - tically two sets of figures have been issued in the past on the crop statis - tics of Nebraska, there was just one set issued for 1918. We feel that never before have such accurate figures been published regarding Nebraska's agricultural products as were published for the year 1918. I would regret to see this work handicapped in any way, after the most excellent results obtained the past year. The part played in backing up the war by the millions of men, women, boys and girls on the farms and the organized agricultural agencies is to be highly commended but is too little known and appreciated. Within the last year, however, we see a change. The attention of the world has been directed to it's food supply. The towns and cities are all directly de - pendent upon agriculture for their existence, and most of them for their growth and prosperity. They must, of necessity, take an intelligent, con- </seg>
            <seg id="p015">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 15 structive interest in rural problems and in the betterment of rural life. They can do this effectively, only as they inform themselves and lend their support to plans carefully conceived by educational and agricultural organizations co-operating with the more thoughtful and successful farm - ers. Already marked response has been noted to appeals that have been made for more complete co-operation by the business interests of the towns and cities, and of their associations in the effort to make agricul - ture more profitable and the rural communities more healthful and attrac - tive. THE 1918 SEMI-CENTENNIAL STATE FAIR Fairs may come and fairs may go but the Fiftieth celebration of Ne - braska's State Fair will linger long in the memory of those who accepted the opportunity to view this great exposition. When I reported to you one year ago I said "It is no longer news that the State Fair of 1917 was the largest State Fair ever held in Nebraska" and now it must be said that the Semi-Centennial Fair of 1918 never had an equal. What a revelation it would have been to the pioneers of fifty or more years ago in Nebraska could they have seen this wonderful Semi-Centen - nial State Fair of 1918. A panorama of fifty years of unbelievable growth would have been spread before them; the change from the un - touched prairies of the state fifty or more years ago to the great agricul - tural Nebraska of today. There may have been those who saw the first territorial Fair held the third week in September, 1859, at Nebraska City, and if so, how they must have wished that their pioneer friends of the first days in Nebraska could have been here to witness the wonderful changes that a half cen - tury has wrought. The modern half century brings changes which are unrealized unless we are capable of going back to conditions at that time and come step by step along the way to the present. What comparisons are presented be - tween that initial territorial Fair in Nebraska and the one just past. Can you for the moment imagine how confusing it would be for you to step from one to the other, one day passing judgment on the best yoke of oxen and the next day figuring on the best tractor to purchase. One day selecting your cradle scythe and the next deciding which self binder was the most complete in all details. Comparing the best hand made wagon against the latest motor truck; the spring wagon with the newest model of an automobile; the native cow with the record producing Holstein or Jersey of today, and how many more comparisons of like value. Is it any wonder that we who are so vitally interested in the agricultural develop - ment of Nebraska contend that the State Fair is educational ? And thus it is that Nebraska, through her State Fair, presented her agricultural </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE growth and wealth along with her industrial progress to the world at a time when increased production along these lines is of inestimable value. The citizens of our great state endorsed this exposition by a quality of exhibits never before seen, and that in a year which was very adverse to the production of normal crops. With approximately 40,000 men hav - ing entered Uncle Sam's service from Nebraska, thereby causing a con - siderable shortage of labor, we came through with an increased attend - ance of some 14,000 over the record breaking Fair of 1917 Thus it con - cretely demonstrates that the State Fair is not merely an amusement en - terprise, but fundamentally an educational institution, and. as such, bad weather and the war did not prevent the people of Nebraska from at - tending this exposition that they might take home with them th° new lessons which they knew full well would be presented before them during the week of the Fair. While celebrating the fiftieth State Fair held in Nebraska, it Is rather coincident that the Semi-Centennial Fair should also be a "War time Fair". From beginning to end the spirit of patriotism was ir evidence, not in a rampant way, but deep seated and earnest, yet ready to bur»t forth into spontaneous expression at the slightest provocation. From every flag pole and vantage point the "Stars and Stripes" floated and the national colors were favored above all others for decorative purposes and, last but not least, the Government exhibit accentuated the pervading sen - timent of loyalty. Adjoining the building occupied by the Government exhibit was a large tent occupied by the American Red Cross. Work was carried on every day and many of those from out over the state received ideas which were of much value to them upon their return home. Nearby were the tents of the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. A special hut built of sacks loaded with sand and covered with timbers in the man - ner used in France attracted wide attention. In every way possible did the 1918 State Fair endeavor to bring as closely as possible the conditions of the war. •FOOD WILL WIN THE WAR." This slogan has hten presented before us, ever since our entrance into the war just closed, from newspapers, magazines, billboards and every known angle of publicity, and nowhere that I know of can lessons per - taining to this slogan be more graphically presented to the people of a great state than at a State Fair. These lessons were presented, and demonstrate that the State Board of Agriculture — by its personnel — hat shown itself a group of efficient and large caliber men, whose genuine ac - tive interest in the success of the State Fair — and Nebraska's activities — and in the proposal and working out of large policies, has been instru - mental in plseirg N«br§ska ia the tcsi*ioR she new hold* </seg>
            <seg id="p017">K Each year there is greater ere is grea line of activity— methods in all lines of activity are yearly improved — and the State Fair to be as effective as possible, and maintain the con- ,t fidence of the people at large, must keep pace with the spirit of ad- vance everywhere. The State Fair of three, five or ten years ngo would in ance ever no way meet requirements of today for it would not show the progress 10 wav meet of the missing years. It is, therefore, imperative upon those directing of the missing the State Fair the State Fairs of the future to see that this great exposition measures up to the advanced ideas and progress in all departments. In short, the Fair must be kept up to date and, where possible, just a little ahead of the times. The State Fair, in order to continue to be an accppt;&gt;ble exposi- Fa tion of the more important resources of the state, must improve those lines of activities which it is designed to inspire and encourage and lines of activities must keep abreast with the progress of these industries. All this I feel the State Board of Agriculture has endeavored to do and will feel the State Board of A continue with increased effort in the future.

Some of them were gripping in the extreme, and one could see by watching the faces in the crowd that the lessons were go - ing home. It was a great exhibit, one that gave a great deal of pleasure to fair visitors and valuable from an educational point of view, in giving the public a better and clearer idea of what the government is doing. It is to be hoped that from this year's experience the government will see the need of placing such exhibits before the people at State Fairs in the future, that we may all be brought closer in touch with what constitutes our nation. In 1917 Nebraska presented an innovation in State Fair entertain - ment — the three ring circus. Never before had a State Fair undertaken such an attraction. Never before did a State Fair attendance approve of an attraction as they did of this one. Therefore your managers felt secure in repeating this attraction for the 1918 State Fair, and again from newspapers and spoken opinion alike came the unanimous verdict that it was the finest amusement that had ever been presented before a State Fair attendance. As a variety, the circus was engaged for but four days, while the automobile races with night fireworks was substi - tuted on Monday. That this variety of entertainment was approved by our patrons is demonstrated by our record breaking Monday attendance. It is said that we judge the future by the past. If this is true, what may we reasonably expect in the way of advancement in agriculture and live stock raising in the state of Nebraska in the next fifty years? The main feature of the 1918 horse show was the exhibit of Belgians, due in a large measure to an Iowa exhibitor who brought out a fine string of individuals. The Percheron classes were brought up to the average. A good pony show was made by the Nebraska breeders and this part of class "A" always appeals to both old and young. With so much competition from the automobile and the tractor and the drain of war, the horse industry in Nebraska needs stimulating. Ninety-one head of Shorthorns were shown and a show well worthy of the breed. The Hereford show was made up entirely of foreign entries. This condition should not be, as Nebraska breeders have some of the best Herefords to be found anywhere, as was recently demonstrated by the greatest sale of Hereford cattle on record, and this record sale was made on cattle raised in Nebraska. The Angus show was up to standard considering war conditions and this breed seems to be making some inroads on the cattle industry of the state. The hornless Shorthorns had a strong exhibit and was an exhibit worthy of note and composed principally of Nebraska cattle. No doubt the strongest Red Poll show of the season was made at the 1918 State Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 19 Nebraska is slowly making progress along the lines of dairyiner and the dairy cattle show of the past fall was a great credit to the exhibitors and to the state. In spite of the high price of feed and the scarcity of labor, the 1918 Nebraska State Fair had the largest swine show in its history, and the greatest show that has ever been gathered together in America. If was the kind of an exhibit that the breeders have dreamed about soir.e day seeing. As you all know, the new swine barn is of steel and concrete con - struction, well ventilated and as nearly sanitary as it was possible to build it. For many years the swine breeders have put on a splendid show at Lincoln in spite of inadequate accommodations, and they richly deserve this splendid new building. They appreciated it and patronized it accordingly. One lesson learned from the recent war was the fact that the sheep industry of the country was at low ebb. It is a regrettable fact that we cannot expect to do much for this industry until a building for exhibition purposes is erected on the Fair grounds where the exhibit of sheep can be properly taken care of and this industry placed before the people of the state in an educational way. The condition that existed last fall is to be deplored and I trust that better accomodations may be provided for this exhibit in the future. The poultry building was well filled with a show representing all of the standard breeds. There was an unusually large display of hares and rabbits. The in - creasing cost of meat has emphasized the value of the rabbit for food. The exhibition of bees and honey was exceptionally fine. One sample of alfalfa honey scored one hundred per cent — -a thing which has never be - fore been accomplished. This demonstrates the future development of this industry in the alfalfa growing sections of the state. The vast agricultural resources of the state were well represented in Agricultural Hall. The men interested in these activities demonstrated that it took more than an extremely dry season to check their spirit and answered the call for one of the largest and best agricultural exhibits that has ever been presented to the Fair going public. Another credit star for these men of Nebraska. Interest in dairying in Nebraska has developed to such an extent that no doubt there will soon have to be a building erected suitable for holding both the dairy products and the dairy cattle exhibits. The butter statue characterized the "Spirit of '18". As the population of Nebraska in the cities grows it will become necessary to largely develop the dairy business, and this Board can do a great deal of excellent work along this line. Here were exhibited two dairy cows holding state records for age in production of milk and butter. One of these with a record of 24.714.5 </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pounds of milk in one year, from which were produced 1,053.4 pounds of butter. The other, a three year old, produced 21,129.9 pounds of milk, equal to 720.3 pounds of butter. Not all of the dairy cows of Nebraska will produce as these two cowi have done, but when more of our dairymen set their aims a little higher, the effect on total dairy products for the state will be noticeable. In the domestic products, fine arts, and textiles one could find many new things to occupy the mind. Many new exhibits were made possible by war conditions. These several departments are deserving of special mention in assembling such excellent exhibits. The school exhibit has become one of the staple exhibits of a county or state fair, and should be encouraged more in the future than they have in the past. We have a right to feel extremely proud of our school ex - hibit and should take pride in what the little hands of the state are doing. The "Baby Show" drew forth its usual commendations and there is every evidence that each year this part of the Fair is doing its duty toward the rearing of a better people. In the continuance of this department, I would suggest that the money premiums be withdrawn and just the ribbons given in recognition of awards. One building is given over entirely to the exhibits of Nebraska Manufacturers, and it is one of the interesting buildings on the grounds. Nebraska is essentially an agricultural state, but its manufacturing in - terests are growing constantly, and there is a large field for further de - velopment which will undoubtedly come. Economic conditions all tend to stimulate the buying of manufactured articles close to home. The auto and machinery exhibit was the most extensive in the history of the Fair. Auto Hall was completely filled with cars and trucks, and some exhibitors were obliged to take space outside in tents. There was an unusual number of trucks on exhibit. This demon - strates that the farm truck for light hauling and delivery work will soon be a part of the standard farm equipment. Tractors of every make and description were on exhibition and large crowd could always be found in attendance around these exhibits. The Boys' Camp contained some 150 boys from all parts of the state. ThiB Camp not only furnishes a weeks recreation for these boys, but pre - sents to them lessons — at a time in their lives when such lessons leave an imprint on the character of the boy — that we trust will be for their best welfare in the years to come.

FAIRS AND THEIK EDUCATIONAL VALUE Early History and Development. Fairs can be characterized as the forerunner of popular agricultural education. Preceding the establishment of the agricultural colleges, agri - cultural experiment stations and the agricultural extension service, fairs have done much to shape the policy of popular agricultural education and to fashion and mold opinion concerning it. The annual meetings of the early agricultural societies, at which the sale of farm produce and live stock were' conducted, were directly responsible for the development of farmers' institutes, the first definite form of modern agricultural exten - sion teaching. Our fairs have cume to us from the old world, where they have had their remote origin in the assemblages of traders and producers. In ancient times these people came together to buy, barter or sell their wares, produce, and live stock. Fairs of this kind still remain in Europe and Asia. The Percheron district in France, as it was before the recent war, developed the famous Percheron horse largely through the holding of local one-day fairs or shows, which have been very ictive in their work. While these European fairs are somewhat changed in character, from the old original type, they still maintain as their main object the disposal of articles shown by exhibitors. As an educational institution, embodying instructive, social amuse - ment and community development features, the modern fair is distinctly "American". &gt;r 1919 will no doubt be heavy, th« jecoming more of a liability than mn </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The outstanding purpose of Fairs in the United States and Canada is the stimulation of improvement in live stock, crops, and general domestic development. The first agricultural fair in America, of which we have any record, was held at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1804, under the auspices of the Massachusetts Agricultural Society. This Fair, the conception of which originated in 1801, was largely characterized by the sale of agricultural products and live stock, after the manner of those formerly established in Europe. Premiums and prizes were not offered, the European idea of a fair, as a place where exhibitors' products could be bartered or sold, still prevailing. This fair proved such a success that the citizens themselves raised the sum of $50.00 for the second fair, held in April, 1808, awarding the money in premiums to the best steer, milch cow, lamb, horse or jack sold upon that occasion. In 1809, the citizens of Maryland, Virginia and the District of Colum - bia, formed the Columbian Agricultural Society, the first incorporated agricultural society, and held their fair in May of the same year. This fair was a great success and the society was very actively engaged for many years in promoting agricultural education along the farmers, mainly through the agency of fairs and exhibits. In North Carolina, on the 8th day of October, 1852, was originated a voluntary organization, known as the North Carolina Agricultural So - ciety, for the purpose of holding an annual fair where citizens "might be encouraged by exhibitions, premiums, and other means, to develop and improve the production of agriculture and every species of native indus - try .... and to which society should be paid, out of the State Treas - ury, $1,500.00 annually, to be applied to the payments of premiums upon agricultural products, implements of husbandry, and domestic animals, and to such other purposes as might be calculated to advance the interest of agriculture and manufactures". You will note that sixty years ago this fair was getting an appro - priation within $500.00 per year of the amount the state of Nebraska gives for premiums today. It is my understanding that this same society, formed in 1852, is still managing the State Fair of that state. POPULARITY AND USEFULNESS OF FAIRS. Fairs and expositions have multiplied so rapidly since their inception that it is not feasible to try to chronicle the actual number now existing in the United States. But a careful estimate places their numlir in excess of 3,000, including State, District, County, Community and street fairs, held at various seasons of the year. And every year sees an increase and a re-direction toward better pur - poses. In the face of the Great War, the fairs of 1917 and 1918 were record </seg>
            <seg id="p023">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 23 breakers, as reports from all sections show, acknowledging the greatest attendance and the largest number of competitors and entries, besides the greatest interest being manifested by the people who attended these fairs and expositions. This national achievement is phenomenal and its explanation lies in three facts: First: Increased food production and food conservation, as conducted by the Government and its agencies — the fairs being one of these agencies. Second: There must be some educational basis for arcusmg, stimu - lating and holding interest in agriculture and live stock, and for show - ing graphically that efficiency in agriculture is being promoted. Third: Proper entertainment and social intercourse are &gt;-.ot only es - sential phases of education in normal times, but become even more so in abnormal times. The more serious our international problems, the greater need for properly directed and guided entertainment in the spirit of the times; in order to prevent the nation from becoming morose and moody, our morale should be kept up. As reflectors or indexes of the sentiments of their communities fairs occupy a paramount position. The types of exhibits displayed and the character of the fairs promoted, advertise either advantageously or dis - advantageously, the interests that people have in meeting the exigencies of the situation. Fairs, therefore, are not only popular institutions but are worth while institutions and should be maintained and improved. They Ltar a most direct relationship to the educational problems of the day, particu - larly to those problems which touch vocational education. The fair itself is largely an exhibition, it is a graphic method of por - traying what has been accomplished- It is the background upon which are pictured the results of progress, improvement, initiative; che applica - tion of better methods and closer study. Some say that a fair is nut so much an educational institution as it is a medium or occasion upon which are displayed the results of the year's education, a meeting of common and mutual interests .where the rate and direction of progress can be de - termined. This, every Fair undertakes to do chiefly through a system of exhibits, competition, contests, demonstrations, and explanations, whose main features are superior crops, animals, machinery, and the various products of the home, school and the state. Fairs are more than this. They are informal conventions of mutual interest, gatherings of people interested in their communities, in them - selves, and in everything that tends to improve the locality, the farm, the home, the church and the school. Fairs are inspirers of community co - operation, of work-together spirit, of common weal. The basic principle of rural organizations is that farmers must be organized around some - thing in which they have a vital, economic interest. Merely organizing rural interests in a general intangible, indefinite manner for the sake of </seg>

Fairs are not money-making institutions any more than the schools are; rather, they are money-losing institutions. If fairs today were not supported by State, County and private subscriptions, they could not exist as in many cases expenses outweigh receipts. On the other hand, properly conducted fairs, with the proper goal in mind, result in incn ased production, by disseminating information and are — therefore — very prop - erly supported by state aid, private subscriptions and, in some instances, by taxation. The fair, therefore, like the school, is a indium for educat- ing people. i Aii PERMANENT EDUCATIONAL FACTORS The Fair, as a unit, is made up of a number of factors, all of which contribute toward the same end, namely, instruction, inspiration, socializa - tion and amusement. The factors are: First: exhibits. Second: con- tests. Third: competitive entries. I entertainment features. urth: demonstrations, and Fifth: When properly correlated, each ir proportionate place, they make up the American institution known as the modern, agricultural fair. When these factors are not properly balanced, the product becomes top - heavy and the result is generally a failure. Too much entertainment, and .often of a questionable variety and not enough instruction, wearies patronage in due time and the fair dies of stagnation. Too much instruction and not enough entertainment fails to secure proper patronage, without which fairs cannot succeed and the purpose for which these institutions were instigated fails. A lack of entries signifies no individual interest, due to any one of a number of causes. No exhibits signify no community interest on the part of schools, clubs of other rural organizations. Where co-operation is not effected with the agencies of the state which are interested in agricultural development, a successful State Fair is next to impossible. The successful State Fair combines all these educational factors. EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF EXHIBITS There is presumably no one factor which can do more to stimulate effort to the improvement of farm conditions, and at the same time to arouse appeals for greater production of food and feed, than the agri - cultural fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 25 It is there "that the farmer has an opportunity of seeing and observ - ing the progress made in the improvement of farm crops and arimals and of comparing his own efforts with the work of his neighbors". The educational value of an exhibit, to the exhibitor, largely lies in the amount of constructive thought and labor placed upon the making of it. To the spectator, the value of an exhibit is measured by the informa - tion it conveys. The magnetic thing about exhibits, particularly at small community fairs, is that they are personal from all viewpoints. The average exhibitor enjoys pardonable pride and egotism in showing the product he has grown, or produced, to his personal friends, feeling in their intimate, responsible admiration, encouragement and stimulation for greater effort. And in the same way, the spectator would rather, by far, see the ex - hibits his immediate friends and acquaintances are showing, because of the easier and more intelligent criticism he can make, knowing the per - sonal background of it all. At these fairs men and women obtain an opportunity for hearing concrete discussions, based personally on the very stock and products that they themselves have brought to the Fair. They get a visual lesson of what constitutes good crops and desirable live stock; also manufactured goods and the image stays with them because they have seen objects, su - perior to theirs. To contribute, therefore, in a genuine manner toward this educational end, the exhibits should be of a kind that will reflect the farm, the rural community, and the factory, and should be based on the things in which the patrons of the fair are personally and vitally inter - ested. VALUE OF CONTESTS Every year sees an increase in the number and quality of various contests at the fairs. These contests may range from young peoples' stock judging contests to the scoring of the most efficient and highly or - ganized farms. In the furtherance of agricultural education and agri - cultural development contests at fairs do, and can still further, play a most important part. They are one of the most popular movements ever inaugurated for interesting people in active work for individual and collective betterment. As Gladstone once said, "An example is worth a thousand argu - ments". There are two ways of imparting information and knowledge. One way is by precept, and the other is through expositions and models. The latter has many advantages over the former, particularly in agri - cultural teaching. The young peoples' stock judging contests, for ex - ample, not only cause the young folks to study the history and char - acteristics of the animals they are to judge, but they also bring them into direct touch with stock and breeders. No organization has a greater opportunity to reach the young people on the farm, than the agricultural fair, through the medium of contests. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "Contests demand the actual doing of things". Putting one's best effort and thought into a task is an education in itself. Following tl.is un with concrete results, in competition with others, is still greater education. "Contests develop a spirit of loyalty among the people of any commu - nity". There is no better place nor more fitting time, at which to an - nounce contests, conducted throughout the year or at which to hold con - tests for which preparation has been made, than at the fail . Good work deserves recognition. Personal and isolated recognition is narrow, it is limited to but one person. Mass recognition is education in itself, be - cause it teaches. The more people a contest touches, the better the work is done. DEMONSTRATIONS. There is no rural institution or organization, that admits of a better opportunity for giving concrete agricultural, live stock, horticultural and home economics demonstrations than the modern fair. These demonstra - tions can be used as a most powerful weapon for educating the people away from the uneducating, unworthy shows and exhibitions present at so many of our fairs, to an appreciation of things that can be instructive and at the same time, entertaining. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ENTRIES AND PREMIUMS. Entries mean something more than simply showing what one has on hand in crops, live stock, fruit, vegetables, kitchen and manufactured products. Proper preparation for exhibiting the best of any product pro - duced means proper preparation in growing, harvesting, and getting ready for the market. The entry that wins a prize becomes more or less the "best seller". It must be admitted that the "finicky" market must be satisfied and the "finicky" buyer is willing to pay the producer for being "finicky". This is the most practical type of education. The most important thing which can be said about premiums -3 that they should be standards and educational, and not abnormal and spec - tacular in character; the day of the monstrosity is past, it is not even good amusement. Premiums must represent tha highest and best that is produced, they are recognition of the known, tried and proven, as opposed to the scrub, worthless and fake. The premium list of the progressive State Fair should be more or less the guide for the county and smaller fairs. ENTERTAINMENT. The big problem is what shall be our type of entertainment. We will admit that entertainment alone will not produce greater crops and better live stock, but indirectly it is an invigorator to the man whe per- </seg>
            <seg id="p027">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 27 forms the work. It lightens his burden and sweetens and gladdens his life. A close analysis and study of the fair situation undeniably proves that "the public has come to expect some special feature" r.t the fair, particularly at the larger fairs. If this is to be purely an amusement feature, it should be clean, not demoralizing. A clean fair means more than good morals, it means good business. In every community there are more good people than bad. Good people will not long patronize a fair that places money above morals. On the other hand, no fair is ever boycotted by any class because it is clean. A fair means the exhibition of all of the products of all of the peo - ple, in fact, every man, woman and child in Nebraska should have some interest in the State Fair, and the Fair held in their community. Create a worker and you kill a critic — no greater truism ever existed. Efficiency is the key note of the day. The organization, like the in - dividual, must be "on the job". Things must not only be done expedient - ly, but they must also be done efficiently. "We live in ar age of steam engines and electricity; therefore, we must work like a steam engine and think like lightning". The late Henry Wallace, pioneer worker and leader for a better agri - culture, a better rural life and better thinking, once wrote, "A fair is often entirely too big a thing to see in one day. Therefore, if you really wish to see anything you must make up your mind in advance as to what particular thing or department you want to see most; and then after mak - ing a brief survey of the whole fair, so as to get an impression of the size and make-up, devote yourself to this one particular thing or department, and, of course, that will be the one in which you are at present most in - terested. Don't neglect, in visiting any department of the fair, to study the people; for if you are to succeed in life, a knowledge of human nature is quite as important as anything else. You will find different types of people in the cattle department, in the swine department, in the agricul - tural department, in the dairy department. For each particular line of business has more or less effect on character. Again certain types of character are attracted to certain particular lines of business. After all, the biggest thing about any fair is the people that attend it. For man is greater than all his works, and the people of a state are a much bigger and grander thing than anything they ever produced in the state, and always will be." We are prone to say that the last three State Fairs held in Nebraska were the best Fairs ever held — this by all statistics is true- The 1916 Fair was held in more normal times, theJ917 and 1918 Fairs in abnormal times, but in conclusion allow me to say: the best Fair is the one that exerts the most influence for good, that makes for better farming, better living and higher thinking. </seg>

Respectfully submitted, JACOB SASS, Treasurer. Treasurer: Maybe our secretary did not mention where the reit of the money is, and I think it would be well worth knowing. I would like to have the secretary state that, in order that the State Board of Agricul - ture may know where the money is and what we are up against. Secretary: You all know that the street car tracks were changed on the fair grounds last year, and a new terminal was built That was one of our problems of 1918. This was accomplished after a great deal of parleying be - tween the Executive Board, the Traction Company and the State Railway Commission. The removal of these tracks was made necessary first by the erection of the new swine barn. We finally signed a three-corr.ered con - tract providing that the State Board of Agriculture would advance the money and build the street car line and terminal on the fair grounds, and the State Railway Commission said they would allow the Traction Com - pany to charge an extra five cent fare and in time that five cent fare was to come back to us and wipe out what we had advanced for re-locat - ing the street car tracks and the erection of the new entrance. I might go into a little more detail and say that the Railway Commission had placed a value on the part of the old street car line in the fair grounds and had allowed the Traction Company to put a mortgage on the whole system and that was taken in along with the rest of the system. When that track was to be removed it was understood that the State of Nebraska, which owned the fair grounds, would own the new street car line and the terminal. The Traction Company simply maintains it for operating their cars over. So in order to keep the entries on the books of the Traction Company at this same equal value we had to remunerate the Traction Company for the old line which was taken up, and under this contract they agreed to take out of the five cent fare this year the first money for the old line taken up, which amounted to some $7,000, and they collected something over $5,000 this year from the extra five cent fare, go there is about $2,000 yet to go to the Traction Company before the Board of Agriculture gets anything out of this extra fare. The relocating of the street car line necessitated building a new bridge and so we put a con - crete bridge across the creek, and the putting in of that bridge and the laying of that track and cindering, and everything, and the building of the terminal costing about $20,748.84, makes it so that the Board of Agri - culture has invested in that five cent fare at this time something like $30,000, and that is drawing interest and it will be paid out of this extra five cent fare as it comes in- That is why we have no money on hand at this time; we have it loaned out to the public at seven per cent interest. Of course we have had to borrow some money but we have coming back to us this $30,000 and something over. </seg>

I have the tickets here and wish those of you who are expecting to attend the banquet would come up and get them. Wolcott: The secretary has a communication to read from J. C. Moh - ler, Secretary of the Kansas State Board of Agriculture. Lawrence : Mr. Chairman, I move that the chair appoint a committee of seven to draw up resolutions on such subjects as have been submitted or may be submitted by members, to report tomorrow morning. Seconded. Carried. Wolcott: I will appoint as that Committee on Resolutions, Messrs Lawrence, Mitchell, Roberts, Jackson, Ford, Parkinson and Hall. Wolcott: We will now have the report of the Committee on Revision of the Premium List. Your Revision Committee begs leave to submit the following report Page 12: Raise the salaries of superintendents as follows: Superin - tendent of tickets, from $30.00 to $45.00 Class H from $35.00 to $45.00. Class J from $35.00 to $45.00. Class L, $35.00. to $45.00. Class O, $35.00 tc $45.00. We did this because we believed the superintendents of these depart - ments are not paid for what they are doing. In fact the assistant super - intendents at $4 a day are earning more money than these superintendents with the responsibilities they carry. Now, Mr. President, I wonder if you want to take this UP section by section or wait and take up the whole report. Wolcott: I think we will take the whole report, and mark it if there is any change wanted and then refer back to it. Jackson: Now turn to page 19, section 15, we cut out section 15 and in lieu thereof we have the following: Section 15: "To each premium number there must be two or more exhibitors to constitute competition. Provided that in case one exhibitor has two or more entries on a premium number and no competition, the exhibits may, if merit warrants, be allowed premiums in full. In classes A, B, C and D where there is no competition the Board of Managers may reduce the premiums to one-half the premium offered where the quality of the exhibit does not, in their opinion, deserve the full premium. In all other classes only one-half the premium shall be paid where there is no competition, except class "E", Poultry, where special provisions are made. The exhibition of stock will commence at the time and proceed in the order specified in the program. Animals not ready at the proper time and place will be ruled out of competition." </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Now, as section 15 reads in the book, unless the executive board pro - vides for it, they will be paid only half money, and, in fact, that made it very confusing to the superintendents and the secretary. I know the members of the executive committee. We would not pass on the question. We would kind of hold it off fearing possibly that we would be rained out the last day or two, and the secretary wouldn't know what to do, and in this new section we are putting in that unless the Board takes action they pay the full money, and it is up to the Board to settle this, and not up to the superintendents and the secretary. Page 43, be amended to read, "Applications for pens before August 1st must be made to the Secretary. After August first to the superin - tendent". Page 43, change to read as follows: "All swine occupying pens must be entered for competition and shown in their respective classes. Otherwise an extra charge of $10.00 per pen will be paid to and collected by the superintendent on a basis of five pigs to a pen". We did that on the recommendation of the superintendent of swine. Some would send in the money for pens to the superintendent and some to the secretary, and they got the books confused so they didn't know where they were at, so we made this change. Then the other change at the bottom where we made it $10 a pen, this was recommended by the su - perintendent and the secretary as well. It seems a great many of our exhibitors are bringing stock in here absolutely for sale, and it incon - veniences the hog department, and did to a great extent last year- We had the superintendents three days driving sheep to one place and hogs to another, and back and forth. Page 47 : We adopted the request made by the Secretary of tht Na - tional Spotted Poland China Record Association, which reads as follows: "At a meeting just held at the Morrison Hotel, Chicago, Illinois, I was instructed to write you and offer to appropriate One hundred dollars in cash from our treasury, to a class of spotted Poland China hogs, to be exhibited at your fair in 1919, providing you will give us a class on equal terms with other breeds. "Hoping this will be satisfactory with you." And we took them at their word so far as our committee was con - cerned. I do not know what the premiums run up to last year, but it was right around $200. That is about what it will run. Class D, sheep, we did not make any change. Poultry, we do not make any recommendations; it seemed to be good enough. We adopted the report of the Committee on Class F. </seg>

To the Honorable State Board of Agriculture: Your special committee on the revision of the score card and irri - gated products of Class "F", makes the following recommendations: 1. That all counties having within their borders ten thousand or more acres under irrigation projects, as determined by each annual sta - tistical report, of the State Board of Agriculture, shall be designated as irrigation counties and shall compete in a district by themselves. A dis - trict which shall be on an equality with what are now designated as Eastern, Central and Western districts. 2. Inasmuch as this increases the number of competing districts to four instead of three, we recommend a money purse of $3,000.00 instead of $2,650.00, in lot 13, county collective. 3. We recommend that lot 10 be cut out and that at the head of class "F" a paragraph be inserted stating that all "irrigated farm products compete only against irrigated stuff, and dry land against dry land, the premiums offered being the same for each class, each entry must be desig - nated irrigated or dry land".

Member: What do you mean by "opt Jackson: No limit; just as they are. open" At this point Governor McKelvie was announced and the further leading of this report was postponed until after an address by the Gov - ernor. Wolcott: Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of introducing to you Gov - ernor S. R. McKelvie, who will speak to us along lines in which we are interested in connection with the civil administrative code. Governor McKelvie: Mr. Chairman, and members of the State Board of Agriculture. My mind has been so diverted by other things from the immediate consideration of this subject that you will pardon me if I occa - sionally stray from the subject and off to perhaps the question of whether or not some particular fellow is entitled to some particular appointment, or something of that kind. I suppose you desire that I shall talk to you about the effect of the proposed Civil Administrative Code in its application upon the existence of the State Board of Agriculture. I shall attempt to answer that ques - tion, but in doing it I must also discuss the principles of administrative government. The civil administrative code, which is in effect a cabinet form of government in handling the civil affairs of the state, was not thought of for the purpose of organizing agriculture; it was not thought classes." </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of for the purpose of relating itself to the banking business, or insurance, or anything of that kind; it was thought of for the purpose of bringing to the administration of public business a greater efficiency and centraliza - tion of authority and responsibility. No one who is acquainted with the conduct of public business as it has obtained in the years past will con - tend that it has been efficient. On the other hand every one who has made any analysis of the subject will agree with me that if the same lax principles, if the same wasteful methods, were employed in private busi - ness that are employed in public business, private business would fail; that no institution, if it was not handsomely subsidized from some source, could exist under the same methods employed for the conduct, for instance, of our state business. We have criticised, sometimes with partisan intent, sometimes with intent to create a general improvement — we have criticised those who have been in public positions- We have criticised our governors — and I will say to you that for the conditions which made that criticism possible, we ourselves are responsible, largely. For we have placed in the hands of the men who are conducting the business of this state, instruments of government that are unwieldy, that are inefficient, and that will not pos - sibly bring satisfactory results. I shall not hesitate to say to you that those conditions exist in this state today; and it does not make much dif - ference about who is elected governor, that it is utterly impossible for any man, I care not how capable he may be, to give to the people of this state a business administration of public affairs. Now it is for the pur - pose of getting free from that thing that the civil administrative code was planned. And it is not a new idea. We have observed it for years and years, in fact always, in our national administration ; there we have a cabinet; we have observed it in our private business, and even in the con - duct of this war our country made no really satisfactory progress until responsibility was centered in men who had the ability to conduct the various departments. So long as we struggled along with boards and committees and various organizations in which the responsibility was divided, we made poor progress. The people complained that an inefficient man was placed at the head of the Shipping Department, one of the most important departments, and immediately a new man was placed at the head of the shipping board, and given different authority, and then we began to make progress. I point you to every private business of any ex - tent that has been a success, and call to your attention the fact that the duties in that business have been subdivided into departments and re - sponsible heads have been placed over these departments. Now if that principle will apply to the handling of our business in Washington, and if it will apply to the handling of the most gigantic undertaking in which the people of this country have been engaged, and if it will apply to private business and prove efficient, I ask you why then it will not apply to the handling of the business of the state of Nebraska. I say to you that it will; and in saying that I do not merely entertain a theory. I point </seg>
            <seg id="p041">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 41 you to another state that has very recently tried it, the state of Illinois, in which the civil administrative code was adopted by the last legislature and has been in effect and force for about two years; and the tax levy in that state, a fact which is attributed by the people of all parties alike to the operation of the civil administrative code, has been reduced one-sixth the past year. Of course we will admit that in a state like Illinois, that has been boss-ridden for forty years, there is probably a greater waste than there is in Nebraska, and altho we may not decrease the tax levy by this new plan of administration, I guarantee to you it will give a more efficient plan of administration of public business. These departments — and I believe that some, much in fact, of the opposition that exists in your body — and I may add, too, that the only definite, well organized op - position that I find to this plan anywhere exists within the State Board of Agriculture. And I believe that opposition is founded largely upon a lack of information, a lack of acquaintance with this plan. Briefly outlined this civil administrative code contemplates the es - tablishment of six departments, named as follows: A department of fi - nances, a department of agriculture, a department of trade and com - merce, a department of labor, a department of public works, and a de - partment of public welfare. Within the department of finance there will be handled the subject of the State budget, there will be handled the work that now devolves upon the state board of equalization, and there will be included a department of audit for all the departments of this civil ad - ministrative government. In the department of labor there will be substantially the same work that there is now; in the department of Trade and Commerce there will be banking, insurance, the fire commission and a part of the administration of the Blue Sky laws. In the department of public works there will be principally the questions of roads, bridges and irrigation- In the department of public welfare there will be a prison board, a state board of health, and other matters, and another division related to the handling of social questions. And in .the department of agriculture, and that is the thing in which you are interested, though I feel sure that you must follow this thing throughout the entire plan in order that you may understand the principle, what it is going to mean in elimination of boards and commissions, — but in this board of agriculture there will be included the duties of the livestock and sanitary board, the food, drug and oil commission, the game and fish commission, and the conservation com - mission, and in fact a new department devoted to the subject of markets and marketing. Now these subdivisions do not include a state board of agriculture. They do not include a single duty which the state board of agriculture has heretofore done except the handling of agricultural statistics. It takes not one thing away from the state board of agriculture except the gathering of agricultural statistics. Well, with those facts in mind I cannot for my own part understand 2a </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE. BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the opposition that arises from some members of the state board of agri - culture, except it be that they do not understand exactly what this means. I have not included the state fair, and I say to you that I am as vitally interested in the success of the state fair as any man in this state. I take second position to no one with reference to it, and I do not believe that to invoke this plan of administration will deduct one iota from this board that is known as the state board of agriculture, because it handles everything it has heretofore done except the gathering of agricultural statistics. One man said to me, why take the gathering of agricultural statis - tics away from the state board of agriculture ? I say because it does not belong there. This plan of administration subdivides the duties of our public affairs into three divisions particularly in regard to agriculture, education, administration and research. That is, one the university and schools; another a department of exhibition and that is the State Board of Agriculture, and another of law enforcement and control, which comes directly under the state administration, in order that it may be successfully accomplished this calls for the centraliza - tion of authority and responsibility. It cannot be otherwise, and I say to you that when you divide responsibility in the handling of law enforce - ment you at once minimize the results you are going to get from your efforts. So it was necessary to include in this department of agricul - ture those divisions that I have named, and I have not included the state fair because I do pot believe that it belongs there. I do not believe the state through its administrative department wants to engage in the hold - ing of the state fair any more than it wants to engage in the holding of a labor show for organized labor, or holding a manufacturers' show for trade and commerce or holding, a bankers' convention for the bankers. I believe those are things which should be retained by those engaged in those various industries. But the state does assume responsibility for certain law enforcement, and it is those divisions which have to do with that law enforcement and control that I have calculated in this depart - ment of agriculture to place under a responsible head where they can be properly, efficiently administered. It is proposed that the heads of these departments shall be appointed by the governor and their appointments approved by the Senate. Well, some one says, perhaps, that simply means that a governor is given more power, more authority, and the fellow who advocates it must be seeking that. I say to you any man who seeks to be elected as governor of this state and is not willing, yea, determined that he shall assume the re - sponsibility and authority for the administration he sets up, accepts the position merely for the alleged honor it carries with it, and not because of the service he thinks he can render; and for my part I say it is the duty of the governor to assume the responsibility and it is his duty to have authority, and unless he has this authority he cannot select men who </seg>
            <seg id="p043">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 43 will work with him and under him and he will be unable to produce defin - ite results. To have the heads of these departments appointed by the governor and approved by the Senate brings the selection of these men immediately to the people. It brings them just one step away from the people. You could not get those appointments closer even if endorsed by your board; not as close, in fact, as by having them approved by the Senate, because the Senate is selected by the people. Then one step from the people are the appointment's of the heads of these departments. Then again, the subject of keeping these matters out of politics, making them non-partisan. I say to you like the fellow who looked at the camel, inspected it, and finally said "there aint no such animal,"— --I say to you there is no such thing as a non-partisan office; they don't exist, and will not exist under our scheme of government, in which the people rule and in which under business factions and what-not the people divide themselves into divisions for what they want to do; so the more we try to get away from partisanship the more we admit the lack of it in our own form of government. Now I say to you I do not believe this plan will affect the activities or the effectiveness of the state board of agriculture one particle. In fact I believe that the co-operation that you would get from such a de - partment of agriculture would be of very great benefit to you. And in fact I would not advocate it if I thought it would injure the agricultural interests of this state. I think you must realize that I am as vitally in - terested in the success of agriculture as anyone, and this plan was not thought of or initiated simply because of the relation it was going to have to agriculture, or the relation it would have to banking, or any other industry; but it was initiated because it is the practical principle upon which we can efficiently administer the public business; and I will say to you that if it does not come today in Nebraska, it will come ultimately, and the one who is willing to stand for and accept our present inefficient methods is not looking ahead. He does not hear the call of the people for a better administration of the money that they vote in taxes. I thank you. I have asked to have delivered here some copies of my inaugural message, in which I have quite fully discussed this subject, and I would appreciate it very much, even though you do not care for dry and un - interesting reading, if you would each take a copy of this message and study this one section that is related to the civil administrative code. All I ask is that you shall inform yourselves fully upon it. Now if there are any who would wish to ask me any questions before I leave, I will be glad to answer them if I can. 'The report of the Committee on Revision was then resumed. On page 87 we adopted the report from Mrs. Brown which reads as follows: </seg>

Cheney, duly seconded and carried, the report of the committee on revision was adopted. Mr. Jackson: The rabbits organization has brought in a request asking for quite a number more premiums; this section is on pages 70 - 71; they have added 11 different prizes and have raised the first premium to $4 instead of $3, the second to $3 instead of $2, and the third to $2 instead of $1. Mr. Cheney: I would suggest that this be laid over until the morn - ing session, and that the committee then make a recommendation. By common consent this section was postponed for consideration until tomorrow morning session. Secretary: Before we adjourn I have a set of resolutions here pre - pared by the Board of Managers for your consideration, and I will ask your indulgence and read them at this time: Whereas: The Board of Managers had a conference in December with Governor-elect McKelvie, held for the purpose of discussing ques - tions pertaining to agriculture, and to consider recommendations to be made to the Legislature. It developed that the Governor had it in mind to recommend a plan for a Department of Agriculture to be under control of a Commissioner of Agriculture, appointed by the Governor. The Gov - ernor's plan anticipates placing all the State activities relating to agricul - ture, except the holding of the State Fair, under the control of the Com - missioner of Agriculture; and, Whereas : That inasmuch as the State Board has been doing a great deal of such work with very little financial or statutory aid from the State; if the Board's legal powers were broadened instead of cur - tailed, it could carry on the agricultural activities and better serve the farmers' interests than could any one man whose tenure in office de - pends on the rise or fall of administrations. A large per cent of Ne - braska voters are independent and the administration will cnange fre - quently, history has shown that but one Governor in the past twelve yean has been able to hold office more than two years. The Board of Managers of the State Board of Agriculture submitted </seg>
            <seg id="p045">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 45 to the Governor-elect the following recommendations, at the same time explaining that the plan was only a tentative one and subject to such changes as might be agreed upon. "1. The first and most important thing to be accomplished is to re - move from party politics the different State Boards which have to do with the control of all activities pertaining to both commerce and agri - culture. Any plan that fails to recognize this important thing is doomed to failure and will not be approved by the people in the final verdict." "2. The different activities should be grouped under two general heads. With our present constitution the Governor would have to be the head of each department. We recommend that the head of one depart - ment should be known as the Commissioner of Commerce and Welfare, and that the other one should be known as tht Commissioner of Agri - culture." "Under the Commissioner of Agriculture we would place the State Board of Agriculture, Live Stock Sanitary Board, and Veterinary Depart - ment, Stallion Registration, Inspection of Foods, Feeds. Oils, Seeds, Dairy and similar activities, with power to enforce all laws pertaining to the same. Of the Department of Agriculture we wish to make more defi - nite recommendations at the present time, which can be worked out still more in detail later." "Commissioner of Agriculture and Board of Agriculture." It is a well known fact that the State Board of Agriculture is entirely free from partisan political influence. We would make some changes that would make this Board even more democratic than it has been heretofore. We would recommend that the Board should remain as it is as to member - ship of the Board proper; that is, twenty-nine members equitably dis - tributed over the State. We would make their election more democratic by providing that at the annual meeting for the election of officers and formulating rules and regulations, and attending to other necessary busi - ness, the twenty-nine members together with the president or regularly elected delegate of any regularly organized county or district Fair asso - ciation; the presidents of all county farm bureau associations (the or - ganization of which has been provided by law ) ; the presidents of such farmers' organizations as the Farmers' Union, State Grange, Improved Live Stock Breeders, Farmers' Congress and such other approved farmers' organizations as from time to time exist, shall constitute the member - ship with power to vote at the annual meeting. This meeting would be held on the second Tuesday in January of each year. It would have power, first, to make and amend laws, rules and regulations; second, to elect members to succeed those whose terms had expired; third, to elect a president, a secretary and a treasurer." "An executive board should be provided for in the following "manner: "The Commissioner of Agriculture should be a member at this meet - ing; and after the election of the aforesaid members and officers, said </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Commissioner shall name a Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture, said Deputy to be selected from the membership of the State Board of Agri - culture, said appointment to be confirmed by a majority vote by ballot of the members present and voting. The Deputy so appointed and con - firmed together with the president-elect shall be members of the ex - ecutive committee for the ensuing year. These two members, together with the secretary-elect, shall then appoint the other three members of the executive board, the same to be confirmed by a majority vote of the members present and voting, before said members shall be qualified to act." "The Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture should be the executive officer of the activities placed under the Commissioner of Agriculture, with power to act in all matters except making new rules and allow - ing bills." "The Executive Committee should perform the duties pertaining to the holding of the State Fair, similar to the duties now performed by the Board of Managers. Said Committee should examine and allow all bills pertaining to the expenses of the Department of the Commissioner of Agriculture. They should also perform the duties now devolving upon the Live Stock Sanitary Board. They should have general powers for making rules and directing the activities of the Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture; also they may invest said Deputy with power to act in their absence on any matter except making rules." "As soon as practical after the appointment and confirmation of the executive board, the governor shall appoint the men so selected as the executive board of the Department of Agriculture, thus giving them power to enforce police regulations." After considering the above, the governor-elect stated that the plan suggested was directly opposite to the plan that he had in mind. Since that date earnest consideration has been given to both plans and we have come to the unanimous belief that the plan recommended by the governor is not for the best interests of the farmers of Nebraska. We believe that the plan we suggested would place the matter on a non - partisan basis; and that it could be depended on, that the Board sug - gested in our plan would always be composed of men who are making such work a life study. It would also insure the carrying out of well - considered policies which would not be thrown overboard every time an administration changes. We believe, however, that if the governor's plan is adopted, all agri - cultural activities should be kept together, including the holding of the State Fair; and that the State Board of Agriculture which has existed for some sixty years — a board which has numbered among its members many of the noted men of the state, should go out of existence. Therefore Be It Resolved: That if the Honorable Legislators of Nebraska who are charged with the responsibility of legislating for all the people </seg>
            <seg id="p047">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 47 and interests of the state, find after serious research and consideration that the policy outlined by the Governor is the wise one to adopt, it would in that case be better to place under the same commissioner the manage - ment of the State Fair. We believe that the board would deteriorate and finally become composed of a class of men who would not command the confidence of the people. We ask the legislature to take into con - sideration the fact that the foregoing suggestions are coming to them from a non-political board, and to consider which plan will encourage the building-up of the agricultural interests of the grand state of Nebraska. Resolved: Further, that we have herein expressed our opinion, and that we will not as an association or as individuals, lobby the legis - lature, but will be glad — as an association, or as individuals, to furnish any information desired, if called on by the legislature or its proper committees to do so. Mr. Roberts: I just heard the Governor make his talk, and if what he says is true, that the only change this makes is to take away from this board the gathering of statistics on agriculture, and it does not affect us in any other way, and the members of the State Board of Agri - culture are the only ones objecting, I would like to know what detri - mental effect it would have on the board of agriculture. Its name was always the State Board of Agriculture, but it was many years after it was organized before it was given the gathering of statistics. We are all interested in the development of our State Fair and do not want to do anything that would put it a step backward; but I would like to know, if the gathering of statistics is the only thing, why the taking away of that would be so detrimental to the State Board of Agriculture. Mr. McArdle: For Mr. Roberts' information I would like to state that at the time of the conference we had with the Governor regarding this matter, as he stated here today, he stated then that he did not intend to interfere with the working of this board on the State Fair, as it now stands. But I do not know what is the phraseology of the bill. If the only thing taken away from the State Fair Board would be the statistics, and that instead of being called the State Board of Agriculture it would be called the State Fair Board — that of course means to some a good deal, sifted down to its logical conclusion. Whether that is all that Is meditated in the bill now I do not know, but it follows that under the present plan the ultimate outcome will be the absolute divorcement of agriculture from the State Fair. You can't get away from that. If you followed his remarks closely you observed that he said it was impossible to have two conflicting agricultural organizations handling the agricultural activities at the same time, and that we all know. In our conference with him he said he had given this the most careful study, and time and again he said "all you will have to do it to run the State </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fair; and the plan for divorce is there, and you will be nothing but a body of men running a state fair, and in no way connected with the agricultural activities of the state. We all know that he is just as anxious for the success of our state fair as anybody in this board or anyone connected with its management, but it is a matter of opinion and we all have a right to our opinion, and we all have a right to weigh other opinions, because we are all human just the same as the governor, and our opinion is that it divorces us from the agricultural activities of the state of Nebraska; therefore I move the adoption of the resolutions as read. Mr. Cheney: A little while ago I believe there was a motion passed by this body to have all resolutions referred to a committee to be reported on tomorrow morning. I would like to have the record read on that motion of Mr. Lawrence. Mr. Lawrence: I would not make any claim to have this resolution submitted to the resolutions committee. I feel it would not be necessary for this resolution to go before a committee. I think the discussion on this resolution is entirely in order. Mr. McCarthy: It may be the members of the board, and more especially the executive committee, are more familiar with those resolu - tions than I am. I as a new member have just heard it read and I think many here are probably in the same position. I could not repeat ten words meaningly in that resolution, and I want to suggest that we do not take action on the resolution now, but let it go over till morning, and if possible get several copies and let us consider it and then when our votes are given they will mean something. Mr. McArdle: I think every member of the board must be more or less familiar with this subject, but I think the suggestion is a good one and is well made. I will add to my motion, or change the motion, to read that the resolution be laid over until the first thing tomorrow morning. Mr. Purcell: I second that motion, and in seconding it I want to add that the Board of Managers had this matter under consideration for some time and they have burned some midnight oil in connection with the matter. It has been considered very thoroughly, and I think the action they have taken has been taken after a great deal of consideration and with one aim ahead, and that is to keep the State Board of Agriculture intact, not only as it is, but if possible to add to its efficiency. I feel that really this is a crisis, that we are nearing a crisis on the State Board of Agriculture, and I would be very glad as one of the members, to have the resolution laid over, to have the members of the State Board, and all those who are interested and have a vote on this matter, and all those who are interested in agriculture, read the resolution carefully and study it, and I believe the more it is looked into the more it will appeal to this body. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 49 Mr. Leonard: It appears to me that if the plan of our governor should be adopted, to change the name of the State Board of Agriculture to the State Fair Board, it would be necessary to repeal all the laws on our statute books in regard to the State Board of Agriculture at the present time. I don't believe we can legally throw away the name State Board of Agriculture, and substitute another name for it unless we repeal the whole thing and commence new, and I am not in favor of it. Mr. Roberts: When I asked the question I did not know that there was any suggestion of changing the name of the State Board of Agri - culture, and I don't think we ought to do that. They tried to do that some time ago, and failed; they tried to change it to State Fair Board, and I am opposed to that. I wanted to know for information what that one change of taking away the statistics would mean, and nothing else. Mr. Ollis: I just want to talk a minute on an idea that Mr. Roberts' question suggested to me, and an idea, too, that really was brought out by the governor in his remarks, in the statement that he could not see wherein it would injure or decrease the value or strength or opportunity of the State Board when all that was taken away from them would be the gathering of statistics. I think you all realize that the agricultural activities of this state have been carried on quite largely without any specific law to work under, and that the State Board of Agriculture has not had very many specific duties given to it or imposed upon it by statute. But the State Board of Agriculture has, partly I suppose from the name, and largely because of the men who have been connected with it and the part they have had in agriculture, and because they have carried on considerable work in the interest of agriculture and livestock, become closely identified with the agricultural interests of the state. The State Board of Agriculture is largely responsible for the forming of a large number of organizations or associations, like the State Horticul - tural Society, the Nebraska Corn Breeders' Association, and Nebraska Poultry Breeders' Association, and I think have encouraged to a con - siderable extent the Potato Growers' Association organized recently, the State Board of Agriculture has taken considerable interest in our livestock sanitary laws, and has made an effort to have some kind of uniform shipping rules established between the various surrounding states, so that breeders of thoroughbred stock might ship stock into other states without any serious handicap, and they have done a great deal of work along that line, and they have been given credit for a large amount of work along that line, but not the credit they are entitled to. It would be difficult to explain all the ways in which the State Board of Agriculture has had a tremendous influence in the building up of agri - culture in Nebraska. And I cannot think of any better illustration than this, if you go down on the street and find an automobile of standard make standing there with the engine running, and running noiselessly </seg>
            <seg id="p050">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 50 there is a wonderful machine working there nicely, which is the result of a tremendous amount of study and of engineer's work on that machine, and it is getting results, and if the driver steps into it and puts his foot on the lever it begins to move off quietly. You don't know why it does; but the study and the work that has gone into it has made that possible; and that is a good deal the way with the State Board of Agriculture, and you all are proud of the fact that you are part of the machine that has been helping to develop agriculture in this state. And as I said before, this has been done without very much warrant of law for them to do these things or authorizing them to do it; but the work has been done and the machinery is in motion. Now we have come to the period in the state's history where it is proposed to enact considerable legislation in regard to how these things shall be carried on and what shall be done for the advancement of agriculture. I think that is good, and I believe the legislature could enact some good legislation along these lines, and give somebody power to put those laws in force, and if we have come to the time when legislation is to be enacted the legislature provides who shall put that legislation in operation, and they specifically say the Board of Agriculture shall have nothing to do with it, and if we leave the name State Board of Agriculture it makes little difference, the people of the state will understand that all these activities will be carried on by another board except the holding of the state fair. When you announce that to the people of the state of Nebraska, what will come to the minds of the people? They are just a state fair board and have nothing to do with agriculture at all. You cannot divorce the State Fair from agriculture; or if you do, from the moment you do divorce it you make a fair that is not worth the name and not worth holding, because if the state fair of Nebraska does not educate the people in the development of agriculture, including all kinds of live - stock breeding, then there is no excuse for its existence. Once in a while you will find some people who sneer at the State Board of Agricul - ture, just as any body of men or any single man will be sneered at more or less when trying to do something; but when you announce to the state that hereafter you are not the State Board of Agriculture, that all the things done for agriculture are done by some other power and all you are to do is to hold a state fair, then you are only a state fair board, and then it is only one step further to say, "It is the Show bunch." Most of you have had experience with the rise and fall of county fairs and you know that many counties have organized good county fairs; and when - ever that has been done by the farmers of that county, and they make an effort and get out a good agricultural show, and put on a good show with stock, in three or four years they have a good fair, but the finances have been hard to handle in those county fairs, and it has been hard to get money enough to put them in good shape, and gradually in a few years they would fall into the race horse man's class, and then after a </seg>
            <seg id="p051">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 51 few years they quit. In the past five or six years county fairs have been on a much better basis in this state, and I think it is largely be - cause the State Board of Agriculture has been assisting them to put on their county fairs. You know there has not been quite incentive enough for men to stay behind the county fair, — the men of the county, and it runs into a race horse association and then in a few years it quits. Now is that to be the history of the State Fair of Nebraska? I hope not. Nebraska puts up the best fair in all the states with the exception of one or two. I was born and raised in Illinois, and Illinois had a good state fair many years ago, and many of you know what kind of a fair they have now; they do not claim to be in the class with Nebraska. They have lots of wealth there, and while many Nebraska counties are sparsely settled Illinois is closely settled, and why should they not have a good state fair? I do not really think that it is any argument to say that we should make a radical change because Illinois has done it. Illinois may have a good fair, but they have not succeeded in the past like Nebraska has. I fear when you take the incentive out of this board, and the con - sciousness that they are part of a board that is doing something and helping to make history, and helping to build up the agricultural inter - ests of this state, then you take away the interest in this State Board of Agriculture. I am merely making this statement because this resolution is laid over until tomorrow morning for action, which I think is a wise thing to Ao, because we want every man here to understand it thoroughly; but I thought some of you might not have gone as deep into it as the Board of Managers, who have been studying it, and I wanted you to kind of get their viewpoint a little bit; and I hope in studying it tonight or tomorrow morning you will look way ahead and at the inside workings of the thing and read history a little bit and then think of these county fairs which have grown up and lasted for a few years and then quit, and this grand state fair, and ask yourself if you want it to result that way. And do you believe any body of men would be more capable than the men that resolution provides for, that will take in members of the State Board of Agriculture, the farmers organizations, etc. ? Take that body of men and you have the leading farmers of this state in there, and you have the prestige of all that body of men, and that body of men will do business, and not only that, but they go back into every corner of the state and get busy pushing it and making it a success. I fear if all this is put in the hands of one man he will not be able to gather around him the strength and influence this body of men would have and would bring to a movement of that kind. We know that administrations change frequently in this state. We will just admit, for instance, that so far as partisan politics is con - cerned, the republican or the democratic party will be in power for twenty years, we know that each new head of that administration will change </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE the heads of the departments, and it will make very little difference whether the politics changes if the administration changes, the man who comes in has his friends and he will put them in office. We know this sort of thing has to be worked out and planned, and a man cannot come into the state and in two or four years work out the plans and develop them as they should be worked out and developed; but if you can put in a machinery that will keep them there working out plans, where new blood is coming in gradually, and is given the ideas the older men have, and supplementing them with its own, you will have a continual chain there that will work out a splendid piece of machinery; but when you put them under the appointive power with changes every two years, I am fearful of what the conclusion or result might be. And I can see that it is not much further to the step where they will say that the county board shall appoint the president of the county fair, and the same argu - ment will hold good, that you centralize the power, and then you have the same thing in the county that we seem about to have in the state. I want to say in all sincerity that I believe Roy McKelvie is abso - lutely sincere and wants to do what is best for the state, but I do believe that while he has a vast amount of information, and spends a good deal of time in getting information, he is a comparatively young man, and I do believe he has allowed theory to get away with his judgment just a little. The motion to lay the resolution over until the first thing tomorrow morning was then put and carried unanimously. On motion the meeting adjuorned until 9 o'clock a. m., January 22, 1919. Lincoln, Neb., Jan. 22, 1919. Pursuant to adjournment President Wolcott called the meeting to order at 9 o'clock a. m., at the Commercial Club. The Committee on Credentials submitted an additional report which completed their list up to the present time, and the chairman stated if there were further credentials handed in they would be added to the list. Purcell: I move the report be adopted. Seconded and carried. The secretary called the roll, resulting in the showing of a quorum present. The Committee on Resolutions not being ready to report, was granted further time. Wolcott: We will hear the additional report of the Committee on Revision. Jackson: The Rabbit Association handed me their report, and I find that they have added about six new breeds of rabbits, and they have increased the premiums from $3, $2 and $1 to $4, |3, $2 and $1, and I </seg>
            <seg id="p053">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 53 personally am not acquainted with rabbits and I don't know anything about what we should do with it, and the committee does not feel that it can take this on itself without the sanction of this organization. Purcell: I would like to ask what do the premiums on rabbits total as the organizations ask for ? Jackson: I should judge from looking over the list it is right around $200. Wolcott: How many classes? Jackson: Eleven. Wolcott: Then as I understand that, by adding another premium of $4 it would be adding $44 to what it was last year. Roberts: This rabbit question seems to be quite complicated and I move that the matter be left with the Board of Managers to take such action as they think best. Seconded and carried. The time having arrived for the special order of business, the con - sideration of the resolutions offered yesterday, the secretary read the resolutions, including the one read the previous day. STANDARDIZATION OF FARM MACHINERY WHEREAS: Recent war activities in the building of ships and the evolution of the liberty motor and the revolution of old methods and ideas has shown to the world what can be done in the way of standardiza - tion in manufacture, and WHEREAS: The farmer's frugal earnings and his generously expended energy are wasted to an unreasonable degree because of the unnecessary lack of standardization of the similar working parts of farm machinery which were designed to save labor and reduce expenses but in fact fall far short of what might be accomplished because of constantly changing models and endless and impossible repair lists with accom - panying delay and expense in making special shipments causing great crop loss and lessening the farmer's efficiency and adding to his expenses. Therefore be it RESOLVED: By the Kansas State Board of Agriculture and dele - gates assembled that the attention of all manufacturers of farm imple - ments and of those in authority be directed to this matter as being of first importance and we request that they comply with this very pressing demand at the earliest possible moment by so constructing their farm machinery that all similar parts shall be interchangeable regardless of where or by whom manufactured. WHEREAS: There is considerable complaint by farmers of the </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE state that impure and non-germinating seeds are being sold to farmers in Nebraska contrary to law, and that the "Inspection of Seeds Law" has not been enforced heretofore as it should be. Also that testing of seeds has in many cases been delayed, causing much loss and annoyance to farmers, and that inasmuch as surrounding states have laws similar to oars which are being enforced; that there is too much impure seed being dumped into Nebraska, and dealers should be given to understand that they will not be allowed to violate such important laws; Therefore be it RESOLVED: That although we have no reason to fear that our present Food Commissioner will neglect this important work, yet we want to remind him that we feel deeply the importance of making the seed inspection department a real department, that we feel that while the inspection of oils may be important, the inspection of seeds and proper enforcement of seed laws means dollars where the inspection of oils means cents, and we wish to pledge our support in the efforts we believe he will make in behalf of this important work for millions of dollars could have been saved to Nebraska farmers by the proper enforce - ment of proper seed laws, and the two important things to be done are: 1st. Prompt testing of samples submitted for inspection. 2nd. Proper police work which will prevent dealers from selling seeds in violation of law. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: That we consider the state and department are fortunate in having the services of the present competent seed analyst; and we recommend that any additional help and equipment necessary to develop this work be secured. WHEREAS: The Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, in annual meeting assembled, review with satisfaction the agricultural activities of the state and the progress which agriculture has made during the past year. We commend the farmers of the state in that they have so loyally supported the government in the great war which for over four years has shaken us to the very foundation of our industries. We look with pardonable pride on this, that when the call to arms came, all the people of our state with unanimity called on our agricul - tural interests as the one industry in which the great state of Nebraska could offer its greatest support. We bare our heads in honor to our Twys who have overlooked present prospects and have offered all honor, hope and even life itself on the altar of humanity, and WHEREAS: The agricultural interests of Nebraska must always be paramount in the industrial life of the state, Therefore be it Resolved: That we urge upon our national government a careful fulfilling of the contracts that it has made with the American farmer. That the minimum price on hogs be maintained inasmuch as the Nebraska farmer has in good faith done his part. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 55 That our congress be urged to appropriate such funds as will stabilize and fully carry out the government agreement with our wheat raisers. That we approve the resolution favoring the standardization of farm machinery, recently passed by the Kansas State Board of Agriculture. That Whereas: It is impossible to comply with our government's request for increased production with the seed that now is permitted to be sold, therefore, we demand a strict enforcement of the "Inspection of Seeds Law." That these resolutions be spread upon the minutes and that the secretary communicate such paragraphs as are patent to the interested organizations. Respectfully submitted, J. F. LAWRENCE, E. J. MITCHELL, GEORGE JACKSON, JOSEPH ROBERTS, N. DWIGHT FORD, G. E. HALL. Secretary: That is the part we recommend to Governor McKelvie. Member: I would like to have the secretary explain the word "laws' there. Secretary: That should be "by-laws." Member: Would it not be wise to make the change? Oil is: I would like to explain that that was an error in typewriting and occurred in what was given to the Governor at that time, and we did not feel like changing the proposition which was handed to the Governor, but this is in quotation marks and is not subject to change. Leftwich: I move that the resolutions be adopted Seconded. Keedle: I want to amend the motion by asking for a roll call on the motion. The amendment was seconded. Cheney: I would like to ask, has the governor's position changed in the matter since the meeting in. December ? In other words, when he appeared before the body yesterday he made a statement; now is his position the same as he held in December; or was his position modified somewhat from what it was in December? We all heard what he said yesterday. • , Leftwich: Among the things he proposed before was to change the name to State Fair Board. He didn't qualify on that subject yesterday, but I assume that he still has that same thing in mind, to give us another name. After carrying this name for the last sixty years he </seg>
            <seg id="p056">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 56 proposes to give us the name State Fair Board. He proposes in addition to that, as I think he said yesterday, that he would take away the statistical part from the State Board. But I am informed by some of the members of this body that he is now willing that we should carry the same old name. However, I am not giving that authoritatively because I don't know, and if there is anyone here who does know I would like to have him express himself and let us know. Cheney: Did you understand him yesterday to say that the only change he wanted to make was to withdraw the gathering of statistics from this board and give it to another board? Leftwich: That is my understanding. Now I think we ought to be free and talk this proposition out this morning. It is before you and I don't think we ought to vote on it until it is thoroughly threshed out. This is a non-political body and we would like to have the expression of republicans and democrats both. I have been a member of the State Board of Agriculture for the past eighteen years, and if I was asked to tell what the politics of one-third of the members are I couldn't tell you. All I know is that many of them hold positions in our state, and I am glad they do, but we know no politics, and consequently we would like to have an expression on this question. If the plan is adopted and he does not propose to take away anything but the statistics, anyway he proposes to start something, and it is the entering wedge, and it curtails our activities. I think for one that we ought to have charge of the veterinary department of this state. We are the men to go out in the state and examine stock for disease; and we are the men who know what is needed in the country as to sanitation. Here are men from all over the state of Nebraska, and they are from the farms. It is not like a man sitting at a roll top desk and telling us what we ought to do, it is men actually engaged in the business. Then here is the serum plant of the state of Nebraska; I think this Board ought to have something to say about that. It is a very important thing to keep health among our cattle and hogs, and we know more about that than a man sitting here and drawing a salary of $5,000 a year; and here is the place to thresh this out. And this brings in the important livestock breeders. All these different owners of different kinds of stock all over the state. And that makes it a body more capable to decide and know with reference to agriculture than any other method we could adopt. Consequently I think we ought to express ourselves. If we have anything to say let us not be afraid to say it right here. This is the most important thing that has come before this Board of Agriculture in my connection with it. I would like to hear a free and open expression of the minds of the members. Hasik: Mr. Chairman — Personally I am in favor of this resolution. I think we ought to pass it today, and not only that, but that the secre - tary and Board of Managers should go ahead and prepare a bill including </seg>
            <seg id="p057">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 57 all these good points contained in this resolution and have the bill intro - duced and pass it if we possibly can, because I don't like to agree to the plan of our governor. Mr. McKelvie is a personal friend of mine, and has been for years; just the same I can't agree with him on creating so many new offices. We all remember that yesterday in his speech he said this plan might not save us a cent in taxation, but it will improve the efficiency. Now we all know that the taxpayers don't give a snap about efficiency so long as it don't save anything in taxes. Most of us are interested in taxation. Not creating a bunch of new offices, warm nests for politicians at $5,000 a year, and all kinds of assistants, and I think the farmers are going to sit down on that, and I don't think his plan will pass; but I am heartily in favor of this plan here, creating two committees, and I think it will broaden the work of the State Board of Agriculture and make our plan work out better, because we would cover more fields. We would look after the sanitation and the veterin - arians and many things that we should have charge of, and I am heartily in favor of passing this resolution today. Smith: I agree heartily with my friend Leftwich. He made the statement that this is a time when people should express their opinions in regard to this matter. This is no place to hide behind a bushel. This body of men, this representative body of agricultural men, either means something for Nebraska or they do not. They must be con - sidered. They must be reckoned with or put down and out. I was opposed to a part of this resolution when I first read it, or when it was first read to us. I thought part of this resolution perhaps was an admission of weakness on the part of this representative body of agriculturists and farmers. I thought that part of the resolution which stated that if the Governor's plan was adopted it might be better to take the State Board of Agriculture and the fair and the management of the fair along with it — I was opposed to that because it might go out that the farmers of Nebraska had given up and weakened, and were ready to say to the legislators here in session that we were ready to turn over the old ship. But after carefully considering this I am willing when the roll is called, to vote aye on this resolution in its entirety. This is no place for us to camouflage. The Governor means well. I happen to be, and I am proud of it, of the same political party and faith, and was on the executive committee in this last election. Now if his idea is right, he has had this idea for a great many years, concentration of power to be given to the Governor, I don't agree with him on that proposition, and don't believe the majority of the people here agree with him. We hope he will change his mind. I agree with him on some points, that we have too many commissions in Nebraska, and too many jobs, and I believe the creating of the new departments called for might create more jobs and better jobs to be sought for by the unscrupulous politicians of Nebraska. It might be all right with </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mr. McKelvie in the Governor's chair, but governors change, and with some one else in the chair it might not be all right. I believe this is the time we should speak, as farmers. If we have anything in Nebraska to be proud of it is agriculture. We might boast of manu - factures but that is only a bagatelle. And if this State Board of Agriculture, representing the best people in Nebraska, cannot be trusted with the power to regulate and build up agriculture in Ne - braska, I don't know who can be trusted to do that God knows It will not be helped by a man warming his feet in a five or six thousand dollar job with the power given him by the people. I say I am in favor of the resolution. With all due respect to the Governor I believe he should give in and should meet us at least half way. McCarthy: I feel that I should explain my position this morning. I am a new member of this organization and this is the first time I have attended one of its meetings. I have not worked with you before and cannot be accused of having any prejudice or any particular friends on this board. Most of you are strangers to me. I asked that this be laid over, and think the opinions this morning ought to be worth something. I just want to bring one point to your attention. The Governor states that he is taking nothing from this board ex - cepting the gathering of statistics, and after considering the matter thoroughly I wish to say it seems to me he is taking everything away from this board except the privilege of holding a state fair. He is taking the vital spirit that has bound you men together. The State Board of Agriculture as he would leave it would simply be a committee to hold a fair. A committee with no power, a committee with no prestige; all you could do would be to take the advice of his com - missioner. I am going to vote for this resolution. I believe in it, and believe in it heartily. Graff: I believe it was a wise move last evening that was made by this body to delay the matter of consideration and action upon this resolution until this morning, and I might say to the delegates present that I have not been in the state of Nebraska but two days in the past two months. I reached here last evening, leaving the latter part of November. I was here at the conference when Governor McKelvie called us in the first of the year. I read here in this booklet where he said, "The following recommendation with reference to the agricultural program was formulated after I received suggestions from, and held a conference with, the representatives of all the farmers' organizations of state-wide importance in this state." I feel, gentlemen, that the Governor did not intend to mislead anybody by this statement; I know that shortly after his election he notified us that he was going to embody in his message to the incoming legislature recommendations </seg>
            <seg id="p059">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 59 which would mean a reorganization and consolidation of some of the numerous boards and commissions. But I want to say to you that the governor elect at that conference stated to us very emphatically that his mind was made up before he heard the representatives of these different farm organizations; and that he did not feel that he wanted to, or would, back up. Now I tell you, gentlemen, I like a good loser. I like this very thing in Governor McKelvie. He has already given us some evidence that he is a good loser since he has been inaugurated, and also prior to that. There is no man so big but that he will make mistakes when he attempts to do big things. He admitted to us at the time of the conference that he was taking this from the new civil administrative code of Illinois. Now for two months I have lived with the farmers and livestock breeders of the great state of Illinois, where I lived the first twenty years of my life; and I want to say to you frankly that the farmers and stock breeders of Illinois are not en - thusiastic over their new civil administrative code law. They are of the opinion that it means building up political machines. That they are losing all voice in the organizations and those things they are vitally interested in. I am quite well acquainted with the gentleman who is director of agriculture under this new civil code law of Illinois. He has the reputation of being quite a foxy politician. He is a good mixer and I believe he is a good loser, which goes to show the reason he is a good mixer. The farmers of Illinois are opposed to that civil code law of their state having to do with agricultural activities, and it has been stated at this convention, last evening, the men who have given so much of their time and so much of their efforts to build up the great agricultural interests of the state of Nebraska, will go home and quit and lay down, because this will mean salaried officers, and those officers will be largely chosen by those who work together in politics; something that never was known in the State Board of Agri - culture. I believe, gentlemen, that if the Governor's policy prevails, I honestly believe it is the duty of every man connected with the present State Board of Agriculture, to ask the legislature of the state of Nebraska to take the tail with the hide. I know what it will mean; it will only mean a continual clash; it will mean two organizations; it will mean that it will be misunderstood by the farmers of Nebraska for many years to come. These men will not care to work against such a condition while such a condition is existing. They will feel that our interests in Nebraska pertaining to agriculture will be better served if the State Board of Agriculture goes out of existence. I don't know why the Governor did not want to take over the State Fair Board, as he wishes to call it now, claiming that he didn't take anything from it. Suppose he leaves it the name State Board of Agriculture; how will the people understand for years to come what is the State Board of Agriculture and what is the Agricultural Com - missioner of the state of Nebraska. In Illinois they have taken this </seg>
            <seg id="p060">60 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mil over, and my friend Charlie Atkins, who is director of agriculture in Illinois at this time, is now asking the Illinois Assembly to also take over and throw into his lap the farm bureaus and farm institutes, state and county, and in fact to take everything over, boots and breeches. Charlie is a great fellow to work; he will take the state of Illinois over if they will give it to him, and the farmers of Illinois, I want to tell you frankly, will never be with them. I have played seventeen kinds of bridge, and muggins, and I don't know what all with them since I have been over there, and while I have been learn - ing those we would take a rest and talk about the State Fair and we would usually drift into agricultural matters. I attended a meeting of the livestock breeders of McLean county Illinois last week, with about sixty members there. I know what the feeling is among the county agricultural organizations of Illinois, in the heart of Illinois, the most prosperous agricultural belt I have ever been in in my life. These men will frankly tell you that at no time have they ever recom - mended or asked for such a law as the one Illinois now has. And I want also to say to you that when Governor McKelvie said yesterday that that law had been in operation for a year and a half, that is true partially, but so far as the interests of agriculture are concerned that law did not become effective or operative until the first day of January this year, and before it became operative that every propaganda was at work to enlarge its powers. They wanted to enlarge its powers before they had tried it. Don't get the idea that the Illinois law is proving a good and popular law, because it has not been in operation long enough to prove anything; only since January first of this year so far as agriculture is concerned. I am afraid that if you are going to stand idly by and see the state of Nebraska create another bunch of commissioners at $5,000 a year each, which will mean $60,000 appropriations just for the six heads of those departments for the coming two years — and how many people will it require to look after those six departments under the commissioners? He talked about economy; say, men, let me tell you something. There are a lot of you white-headed fellows in this bunch, older than I am, considerably older. Did you ever know the time when the administration of your state, or of the Nation, changed, but what that holler went up, that those in power were a bunch of spendthrifts and incompetents, and all the mean things you could say about them? Let us just go back over the history of our state for a dozen years or so. Every succeeding administration, if of a different political complexion, has accused the outgoing administration of being extravagant, and they would refer to the great amount of money the administration had squandered, the taxpayers' money. We have gone along through all those years, when the legislature felt fearful to appropriate as much as two million dollars to carry on the state government; and that has now got up to </seg>
            <seg id="p061">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 61 five or six million and more, and we have kept right on hollering. We have got the goods, and we have got to pay for them. I don't believe there is much in that, men, and at this time, knowing that the constitutional convention of the state of Nebraska is near at hand, it looks to me foolish to do what the new governor is asking us to do. And it is not party politics with me. When a man asks me what my party politics are, I would like to have him put me down as about 50-50, the way I look at the proposition. I don't know what your party politics are, men, that does not concern me. What concerns me much more than that is what are you as men. What do you represent; what do you stand for; how dependable are you? Those are the things that count, and I don't know — I don't want to say a word, gentlemen, that I feel would be a step backward or mean a step backward. We must either go forward or backward; we cannot stand still. I wish the governor of Nebraska a successful administration. I want to say to you that I have known him since he was a three-quarters grown boy, when he was raising pigs out here in Clay county; I have been in his home many times, and he has been in mine. He is the right kind of a man; I have liked him from boyhood up and I shall never quit liking him, because I know he is a man who does things. He is not asleep; he is always up and doing; but it might be well even for such a man to sometimes counsel with his friends when he is adminis - tering to a great state, and that he must now do as chief executive of this state. Leonard: I was in Illinois part of the time that Mr. Graff was there, and in the same county where Mr. Graff was. Mr. Graff spoke of the fact that this new power over there wants to take over the farm bureaus in Illinois, which is the fact, and I think Mr. Graff knows as well as I do that the leader of the county agents of Illinois is in his home and native county. His name is Robbins. He used to be a representative of the Breeder's Gazette and frequently was on our fair ground here; and while I was in Illinois about the first of Decem - ber, he knew what the Governor was trying to do, and he was with the importers of Percheron horses, and while I was there with a friend the members of the Farm Bureau of Taswell county had a meeting, and it was my pleasure to be at that meeting, which was at Washington, Illinois, and in that meeting Mr. Graff expressed almost the same thing that Mr. Graff has expressed here today, that if they did succeed in taking over the farm bureaus and farmers' institute work and all the activities of the farmers of Illinois it would ruin the state of Illinois, and it would be only a year or two until they would be glad to go back at least part way if not all the way. I happened to be in this county of Taswell, I think the greatest draft horse center of America, or one of the greatest, according to the population. And those horse men are organized against this Illinois law. I was there and met a num- </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ber of them, and know this to be the fact. Yesterday I did venture to say, and I think perhaps I was the only one on the floor who did say, that if they took part of this State Board of Agriculture, to give them the whole of it; if we want to die let us not die by inches; we will be doing something while we are alive, and if we must die let us die through the legislature; and I don't believe they will ever turn us down. I am heartily in favor of this resolution and was from the time I first heard what was in it. Cheney: It seems a strange thing to me that a governor who has been so closely identified with these farm organizations for so many years, and who has such a firm conviction in what he presented yes - terday, does not have someone in this body who knows his position and is willing to present it. We men who live from 100 to 250 miles from here and know nothing of these matters except what we see in the newspapers are absolutely at sea on this matter except as it is presented here. And with the influence which the governor had until he became governor, and the work he has done with the Board, it seems to me his position, if he has any, and he seemed to have yes - terday, should have been presented here by someone; and I do not know what it is today, and right now the argument is all against the gov - ernor. Everything that has been said here this morning is against his position. But it occurs to me that somewhere there must be some good reason why he is advocating what he does. I am for the agri - cultural interests of this state, personally and for the county which I represent, and I am anxious, and only anxious to do what is for its best interests. Before I went west I lived in Lancaster county on a farm for more than twenty years. My people were exhibitors at your state fair for years. Since I have been out there I have assisted in exhibiting at the fair. I have helped in trying to push the matter of farmers' institutes and kindred matters, and I do not care what method we use in these matters just so we pick out the method and the plan which will appeal to us all as the best plan. But it does seem to me that the Governor must have some good reason for the position he took yesterday, something which has not been presented here. Otherwise my opinion of the Governor as a resourceful man would have to be changed somewhat. I am merely asking if there is any more light to be thrown on this subject; if there is I would like to have it given to us before we vote. McLaughlin: I am very much in sympathy with the position of the State Board of Agriculture. In fact I have spent considerable time in the last few weeks trying to convince the governor that my view - point, which is similar to that expressed here, is correct. I want to say this much, however. We refer to this as a resolution. The propo - sition this Board took to the governor, I think they have taken abso - lutely the right stand up to the resolution part of this; but I am </seg>
            <seg id="p063">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 63 afraid that right there we are making a mistake. I would like to have this Board go before the legislature with a State Board of Agri - culture bill. But instead of that you lie down and say we will not do anything; that you will not lobby, or present a bill even; that you will simply lie down. I think that is the wrong idea. I would cut out the last preamble and the last two resolutions. In a straight, honest way I would work for the principles I believe in and would work for a bill in the legislature that would build up the work of this Board, and not lie down. I am for what you men want, and the local men on the Board know it, and know that I have been working along this line for the last two weeks; but I believe these last two resolutions and the preamble just before them, are wrong, and I believe you will regret it if you put it through in that shape. I wish the secretary would read the last two resolutions, but I think you ought to be a set of live men working in this legislature for the strengthening of this State Board of Agriculture. Hoffmeister: If the legislature hates anything in the world it is a lobbyist. It thinks a lobbyist is a thing with horns on, and I don't think we want to bring this Board to the point of going to the Sec - retary of State's office and registering as lobbyists, and if you go into the legislature to lobby, and don't do that, the state might prosecute you. I don't believe in that. When this government was instituted by our forefathers they said they would have three branches of govern - ment. The legislative, the executive and the judicial. More and more in the last few years it seems to me the executive branch wants to absorb the legislative powers of the country. The legislature springs direct from the minds of the people. They may say what shall be the law. It is not for the executive, either the governor, or the president of the United States, to wield the big stick and say, "You do so and so or I will be against you." He has the veto power and the people have given the legislature the right, even if he vetoes a bill, to over-ride his veto power. I think with all due respect to our present governor, that he will do with this legislature as other gov - ernors have done. Gentlemen, there might be times when the con - stitution will be set aside. The constitution of the United States has been set aside several times in the last two years; no man was ever endowed with more power than President Wilson; neither Napoleon nor any other man ever had the power of President Wilson. The peo - ple of the United States, and not only they, but the people of the World, are hailing Mr. Wilson as their saviour.. He is over there in France today. He went there with clean hands. He says the Ameri - can people told him we did not want any war indemnity, we do not want rank from the enemy's country, and he went there clean-handed and with power, and he is a clean man; but gentlemen, I do not like this concentration of power in one man or in a very few men. The </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE State Board of Agriculture consists of representative men from every congressional district in Nebraska, and represents every county in Nebraska, and I think the people would rather trust these men, who come direct from among them, than one private individual. Roberts: It seems to me that the State Board of Agriculture needs no defense. All you have to do is to look back at its history since the time it was moved from Omaha to Lincoln. It came to Lincoln in debt, and if you will look over the records and see the progress it has made since that time, and see the amount of money that has been turned over to the state for improvements on the State Fair grounds, it seems to me there cannot be any question about the stability of the manner in which this Board has been handled. If there was anything about it that was disabling it or crippling it in any way there might be some reason for making some change; but it seems to me that the growth of this Board from a sapling to a giant oak at this time presents no reason for making a change, and I certainly am not in favor of making any change. Graff: I know some of these men do not and cannot understand why the governor at this time is asking for this radical change. I would ask them to go back over the history of the state, and they will find that it is only a laudable ambition of a man becoming the chief executive of a great state to desire some real constructive legis - lation, and I would put the proposition this way. I want to be fair with the governor first. The governor in his conference with us made the remark that he had been in Illinois, had talked with men having to do with the new civil administrative code of that state, and that they were very enthusiastic over it; and I know that the governor was speaking true; but who was the governor conferring with? Let us just stop one moment and think about it. He said he went to Springfield; you know what Springfield is in Illinois. This is where every officer, every office seeker, and every politician, has his headquarters, and we could not expect that the governor would get very much contact ex - cept with the very men who now have to do with the new civil ad - ministrative code of the State of Illinois. And we could not expect that those fellows would be knockers against it. But say, men, I be - lieve you represent the people in every section of the State of Ne - braska. I don't believe you are here representing political gangs or machine politics; you are representing what is everything in the state of Nebraska, and that is agriculture. You men know, and I believe you know better than even a man like the present governor, the feeling and the situation of the men on the farms throughout the state of Nebraska. Those are the men you come in contact with. When you stop to consider that you can easily see why the governor, with the beet intentions, may have got on the wrong track somewhat. And while I have the floor I also want to say that I believe, as I </seg>
            <seg id="p065">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 65 mentioned last evening and as Mr. McLaughlin has mentioned this morning, that this Board should have something to recommend. We are here taking action upon something that is going to mean more for agriculture in Nebraska than anything I can remember for many years. We have reached the point where some action is going to be taken, and I believe that this body, after the disposition of this resolution, ought to take some action, either that a bill should be drawn which I be - lieve would be the proper way to dispose of this matter, or that some other action be taken. There is no question but that some ac - tion is going to be taken, gentlemen, and I don't think it is even fair to the governor, if we are opposed to his plan, that we do not offer some plan to take its place; and I believe this body is able, and is willing to see to it that a bill is drawn only affecting the agricultural activities that come in our line. We have nothing else to criticise or condemn, as an organization, in all the rest of this civil code that the governor has in mind, excepting those things having to do with agri - culture in this state. Pugsley: I find myself in rather a peculiar position, and in a posi - tion perhaps to give you people some information in which you will be interested. I am a member of the State Board of Agriculture and am tremendously interested in this work, and always have been. I have not always agreed with the actions of the State Board of Agri - culture; I don't always agree with all the actions of my wife, but I love her just the same. Neither do I agree with some things my father did to me when I was a boy; but I love him nevertheless. I happen to know what the governor had in mind when he proposed this bill. Governor McKelvie was exceedingly anxious that there should come to the state of Nebraska some plan of legislation which would effec - tively carry out the laws passed by the legislature. He saw the work of the Livestock Sanitary Board, the work of the State Veteri - narian, he saw the work of the Food, Drug and Dairy Commission, and he saw the work of a lot of other departments and commissions at the State House, particularly relating to agriculture, and part of the other state activities, carried on under men who were appointed by the governor to carry on that specific work, and he saw these depart - ments being carried on independent of one another, without any corre - lation; and I think anybody who has looked into the work of some of those boards and commissions knows that something ought to come to our state government that will give us a more effective administration of the law. Whether the governor's plan will do it, I am not discussing just now, but something ought to come to us along that line. Those of you who know Mr. McKelvie, know he is a business man. That cannot be gainsaid. He has built up one of the largest farm paper businesses you can find in any state of the nation. And he has done that naturally, as all business men do things, by centralization of power. 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p066">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 66 By the organization of the business into departments and placing in power, men to do those things, and if they do not do them to suit him their heads come off. Now what you want here, I know from what you are talking, and what I absolutely believe in from the bottom of my heart, is that every part of the administration of the law shall be as near to the people as possible. I am a great believer in the passing of laws and saying that the people shall administer them locally. That is the reason I believe that if there is a county agent established in any county, that man should be nominated, and hired, and elected, and fired, if need be, by the people in the county. That is the reason I believe that if there is a county fair in a county that fair should be managed by the people in that county. I believe in getting the administration as close to the people as possible. Now the plan presented by your Board of Directors, with which I agree quite largely, but in which there are some things I would like to see changed, is what they believe to be a plan which will administer the agricultural affairs of this state through the people themselves who are interested in agricultural affairs; and I believe that ought to be presented to the legislature in form so it can be considered along with the governor's plan. I believe Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Graff are right, that there should be a bill drawn in some concrete form so the two can be compared. The governor believes in centralization of power in the governor, which he feels is one step removed from the people, when approved by the senators. In other words, he thinks if the people elect the governor and the governor names a cabinet, and the government does not please the people, they know whose head to chop off, and that is the governor's. The governor is honest in his belief. # He thinks the thing he is advocating is the proper system of government, and that has been expressed by all you people who have been talking here, that you believe he is honest in this belief, and you know the governor well enough, I believe, to know that if he is convinced that he is wrong he will face about and go the other way. He has done that once or twice, and he is likely to do it again before he is through with the legislature. There have been some questions here upon which you would perhaps be glad to have me give you some information. I am not arguing one way or the other on this matter. This civil administrative code no one has seen yet, because it is incomplete. It covers 400 pages of type - written matter. It has been introduced and is now being prepared, with others, for printing. In that 400 pages there are very few changes in the laws of the state, or rather no changes in the laws and very few changes as to where they shall be administered. The only attempt is to bring these laws into logical departments where they can be administered in one department rather than in several. For instance agriculture and livestock, sanitary work, food, drug and dairy work, things ad - ministered now outside the State Board of Agriculture, be proposes to bring into one department, and \n the preparation of the ad- </seg>
            <seg id="p067">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 67 ministrative code he is bringing these laws all together and patting them under the administration of one man appointed by the governor, rather than under one or two dozen men, who are appointed by the gov - ernor also, but independent of one another. These laws are simply being taken and re-arranged into these departments. That is not to say that there will not be some changes in these laws when they come before the legislature, because they doubtless have some ideas about how these laws should be amended, but so far as the civil administrative code is concerned it deals only with the place where they shall be ad - ministered. The governor made the statement yesterday that he has not changed the laws in regard to agriculture except as to the agri - cultural statistics; and that is true. He is not proposing to change the name of this board. The suggestion of Mr. Ollis yesterday was that the two department's with names so similar would tend to confuse the people; if you have a state department of agriculture and a State Board of Agriculture, the legislature would doubtless consider that most carefully, especially as they would have somewhat similar duties also; but the governor is not suggesting that change. He does not want to interfere, he says, with the duties of the State Board of Agriculture; he means to keep the name and the duties as they are now, except the matter of statistics, which was added to the duties of the board of agriculture some time after they had the management of the State Fair. That is a thing I think every legislator ought to consider with exceeding care. I am thoroughly convinced that a matter of so great importance should not be left in a resolution, but should be put in some more tangible form, to be considered along with the other plan; and I want to assure you the governor is anxious that some plan shall be arrived at that will be the best for the administration of the affairs of the state. McLaughlin: It seems to me by this last resolution we are tying oar hands right here in regard to working for any special legislation. I may be wrong, but my heart and soul are for holding together the State Board of Agriculture, and adding to its power rather than taking from it, and I would hate to see anything done here that would be inconsistent with our presenting a bill to the legislature and I be - lieve that is what we should do. That is what is being done with other things in connection with the civil code and I think it is the proper thing to do with every question that comes up, this as well others. Smith: I am heartily in favor of the resolution, but I agree with Mr. McLaughlin that we should have some constructive movement on this subject. By the adoption of this resolution we disagree with the plan of the governor. We have here a tentative plan proposed, not as complete as the majority of us would wish it to be, and I wish to say I think someone should be appointed to see that a bill is drafted </seg>
            <seg id="p068">68 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE setting forth the ideas of this State Board of Agriculture, something constructive, that the legislators will have the two to work on, and I am willing then to leave it to their verdict which of the two they will take; I therefore would like to see this voted upon now so that we might take action. I think it would be undignified for members of this body to go up and lobby with the legislators, for this bill, and I don't believe we have to do it; I believe this body will be con - sulted by the members of the legislature in regard to these bills. I believe we have a body of men there who will be glad to hear when we have something to say, and I don't believe we will be obliged to go there collectively or individually to take up the time of these men. The previous motion was called for, the roll was called, all voting aye except Mr. Thiessen. McLaughlin: I vote aye with the explanation I have already made. I am heartily in favor of the resolution. Smith: I believe we can suggest a better policy than that sug - gested by the governor, and I vote aye. The result shows 57 votes cast, 56 being affirmative, one negative. The motion was declared carried. Smith: The treasurer is here with the expense money for the members that has been allowed annually, and I move you that those entitled to their per diem and railroad fare be allowed $5.00 per day for three days and actual railroad fare. Motion seconded and carried. Leftwich: I move that a committee of three be appointed to formulate a bill from this resolution, to be presented to the legis - lature, embodying the wishes of the State Board of Agriculture. Seconded. Leonard: It appeals to me that the officials of the State Board of Agriculture, instead of a committee of three, should be in charge of this matter. I do not know who this committee of three might be, but I imagine that probably two of them at least would be appointed from the Board of Managers or some of the officials of this Board, and I don't know as it would make it cumbersome to have more. I would like to amend the motion by saying that the administration of this Board be appointed to look after this matter. Seconded. Leftwich: On that amendment I will say this, my idea in having a committee at large, or from the whole membership, there are some members who are not on the Board who have had more legislative ex - perience perhaps, and are better acquainted with the making of laws, and they might help in seeing that when drawn the bill would be constitutional. That is my only idea. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 69 Smith: I voted aye on that resolution of course with the under - standing that a bill would be drafted, but I cannot agree with Mr. Leftwich on the size of that committee. I believe the president and secretary elected here today should be a part of that committee, and I believe the number on that committee should be increased to seven, Including the president. I make this amendment to the former motion. Leftwich: I accept the amendment making the president and sec - retary members of the committee, and the number on the committee to be seven. The amendment was carried, and the motion as last amended was carried unanimously. The Board considered the resolutions that had been presented and it was moved, seconded and carried that the report be adopted. Purcell: It has been called to my attention that if we could have a committee appointed on resolutions at the time the other committees are appointed, it would give an opportunity for getting resolutions before this body embracing important things along agricultural and stock lines, in which we are directly interested, and would probably give us a better service than we can secure by the matter being hurried, as it must be at the meeting; therefore I move that the by - laws be amended to include a committee on resolutions to be appointed when the other committees are appointed. The motion was seconded and carried by unanimous vote. The election of members of the Board being next in order the president appointed Messrs. Hall, Cheney and Riesen as tellers, and the roll was called and the ballots collected by the tellers.

President: It will be necessary to take another ballot in the fourth district. Mr. Hasik: In order to be a good loser in this game I want to withdraw my name. Ollis: I move the rules be suspended and the secretary be in - structed to cast the ballot of the whole organization for Mr. Gustafson. President: The motion is out of order. You will prepare your ballots for Mr. Jones and Mr. Gustafson, as Mr. Hasik has withdrawn his name. The third ballot was taken, and the result announced as follows: Ballots cast 55; Mr. Gustafson received 28, Mr. Jones 27.

President: I cast the full 59 votes of this organization for E. R. Danielson for secretary, and he is elected. Danielson: I don't want to make any long speech, gentlemen, but I do want to thank you, and I do want to say that I think we are going to put a fair on this year, and I would like to see it dedicated as a Victory Fair, and I guarantee to put all the pep I have into that 1919 Fair, as I have into the 1918 and 1917 fairs. And I believe we will go just as far as we have gone before, if not further. I thank you. Smith: It has been the custom for years to empower the Board of Managers to make corrections wherever errors might occur in the premium list, and I move the Board be empowered to make any corrections in the premium list where matters may have been over - looked, and in judges where any matter may have been overlooked. Seconded and carried. Smith: The regular order in this would be to move a reconsidera - tion of the report of the Committee on Revision. On page 12 of the premium list a matter has been called to my attention. The amount given to superintendents living outside of Lincoln has been $3.00 a day and that is entirely wrong. You can afford to give your superin - tendents enough to cover their meals, and if they sleep on the ground that is their fault. I move the superintendents living outside of Lin - coln be allowed $4.00 a day instead of $3.00 a day. </seg>
            <seg id="p072">72 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The motion was seconded and carried. President: I will appoint on the Board of Managers George Jack - son, Mr. Caley, Mr. Purcell, Mr. Leftwich. Member: I move the Board ratify the selections of the president for the Board of Managers for the ensuing year. Motion seconded and carried. President: I have appointed as the committee to draft this bill besides the president and secretary, Mr. Ollis, Mr. McArdle, Mr. Me- Laughlin, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Graff. Cagle: I move the Board request the board of each county fair, the membership of each county or State Farm or live stock organiza - tion, to send any suggestions they may wish to make in regard to the bill to be drafted to the committee who are appointed to draft same and that after the bill is drafted they should make known to the legislature their approval or disapproval of same. Jackson: I think the suggestion a good one, but you have just twenty days in the session to introduce bills, after today you have just nine days, and that is not long enough to get returns from the individual members, and especially from county organizations, and to frame it up into a bill. It would be just the thing to do, but it is too late for it to be possible; at least it is a question whether it could be done or not. Ollis: Of course it naturally follows that any such suggestions must be made immediately; but it shows a good spirit in asking them to make suggestions, and I think it would be a good thing for them to make known to the legislature their approval or disapproval of the bill. Smith: I want to say I think every farmers' organization in the state, before this bill is passed, ought to get behind the bill. Jackson: I was wondering if it would not be a good suggestion that after this bill is framed up by the committee, to have it sent out to the heads of these organizations, with suggestions that they amend it, but the bill must be filed immediately. Cagle: My idea was to get the expression of the people to the legislature in regard to what they wanted done in regard to this bill we have been talking about. McCarthy: I move the suggestion of Mr. Jackson be made as an amendment to the motion. The amendment was seconded, and carried, and the motion as amended was carried. Member: I move we adjourn. Motion seconded and carried. </seg>

            <seg id="p207">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 207 FRENCH AGRICULTURE By Dean E. A. Burnett To one who lives on the fertile plains of Nebraska the farming methods of France seem strange and often crude in contrast. Our large farms have taught us to save labor by the use of machinery and power, while on the small farms in France hand labor is cheaper than power and better adapted to their use. Here farmhouses are located upon the farm, while the French farmer lives in the village and goes out each day to his work. Isolated farmhouses are the ex - ception, but everywhere one finds hamlets nestled in some beautiful valley or standing on some vantage point overlooking the fertile fields, with vistas of rolling plains or rugged hills. The houses in rural villages are built of stone — so long ago that no one can remember — and the well-tilled gardens and open fields give character to the country. Many of these towns date back from five hundred to a thousand years and some to even earlier times. The stone paved streets are narrow and the houses built flush with the street, without sidewalks. Macadam roads bind these villages together, reaching every important town and nearly every hamlet. Since rain prevails so much these roads are necessary to travel. Many of them were built for military purposes and these are kept in repair largely by the state with only moderate local expense. Others are built and maintained largely by the province or the commune. The land has been divided and subdivided through the generations until relatively few farms are large enough to use machinery. In most localities a farm is further separated into small parcels not contiguous to each other, so that a farmer owning twenty acres might have it in several separate parcels. In one section, the province of Cote 'd Or, one-half of the farms are less than twelve acres in size, while the average size of the farm for the province is twenty-seven and one-half acres. In Normandy and Brittany farms are larger, averaging in La Perche about eighty acres. With the passing of each generation grassland and meadow, grain field and vineyard are each divided to all the children alike. It has been so since the French revolution. The reverence of the Frenchman for land makes buying and selling almost unknown and the exchange of land with a neighbor so that their land may be brought together is seldom accomplished. The character of the land largely determines its use. In the east and south the hillsides are planted to vineyards, the table land to wheat and other grain. In the valleys garden crops and grass are grown. The vineyards are noted for the quality of grapes produced. Much labor is spent upon the wine industry. In the eastern and southern parts of the country about 10 per cent of the land is planted to vineyards and probably more than 10 per cent of the labor is </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE expended upon the crop. Most of this is hand labor, required in terracing and cultivating the steeper slopes, carrying manure in baskets up these steep hillsides, and tending the crop with infinite skill acquired through generations of training. In western and central France the live stock industry is more prominent and many of the farms maintain horses or brood mares for work. Especially is this true in Normandy, the home of the Percheron horse and of a breed of cattle named after the province. Here grain crops, alfalfa, crimson clover, and other legume hays are grown. Potatoes and sugar beets are common crops, but much land is kept continuously in grass. Most of these pastures are permanent and are never plowed. M. Tasheau in speaking of one of his pastures said, "I have never plowed it, nor my father before me. For more than sixty years it has grown nothing but grass. It overflows sometimes in the spring but not for long." Tame grasses have been introduced by seeding. No manures or fertilizers have been applied, and still the grass is rank and nutritious and not equaled by any of the newer meadows or pastures. In the center of this rich grass land the Percheron horse grew to prominence and came into vogue. First he was known as the French draft or Norman horse but later through refinements and selection in the Province of La Perche the Percheron horse was developed and became popular for local use and export, especially to America. In this region farms from 100 to 200 acres or more are not un - common. Wheat, oats, barley, hay, and legumes are grown, and rotation of crops is practiced except upon the pasture land. Many farmers keep purebred Percheron mares to do their work, which is not so strenuous as on our large American farms. Ten to twenty acres of wheat, a field of oats, a timothy meadow with crimson clover or alfalfa for soiling and hay are common. The plowing is soon done, the manure soon applied to the land, and work is light through - out the remainder of the season. Colts are dropped rather early in the spring. The horse colts are generally sold while only a few weeks old for delivery at weaning time. They are bought by a few large farmers who keep them growing in large pastures, with shelter and hay in winter. In normal times oats are also fed in winter and some roots to secure plenty of growth while young. Valley pastures are specially desired for growing out these young colts, as heavier weights and more bone is secured than on the grass grown on the thinner soil. At about two years old these colts are fitted for the market by stall feeding and handling. The French government bays a few of the selected stallions for its Government farms and others are sold to private buyers. The government maintains a number of stallion farms where superior horses are kept for the use of the farmers. During the breed- </seg>
            <seg id="p209">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 209 ing season these horses are stationed at nearby towns in the district to make them more available for use. Many privately owned stallions are also kept, much as in this country. The best of these horses are sub - sidized by the government as an inducement to farmers to improve their horses through the use of good sires. Others of sufficient merit are approved for breeding purposes, but owned privately. This region is also the home of the Normandy cattle. They are red and white in color with some brindle streaks. They are valued for both beef and milk and are the standard dairy cattle of the region. Since they receive little or no grain they do not become fat as our corn fed cattle, nor do they produce as much milk and butter as our dairy breeds. Still they are greatly in demand in this province and this demand extends somewhat outside of Normandy, especially to the north and to the west into Brittany. Norman cows are said to produce about one pound of butter per day when fresh, or 300 pounds per year under favorable conditions, without the use of grain. This would doubtless be increased about one-fourth by feeding grain as we do in Nebraska, but grain is not available since war conditions prevail while grass is much better there than here. In Normandy and other rich grass regions cattle are not only grown but fattened on grass. The smaller farmer sells his steers to the butcher or to some larger farmer who has more grass or richer pastures. Many steers are raised in this way to three years old and fattened during the summer for the markets of the larger cities. In Paris last summer (1919) dressed beef was selling as high as three franks or fifty cents per pound by the side or carcass, the wholesale price being still further increased by the retailer. In northern France where most of the sugar beets are grown, heavy cattle are fattened on beet pulp with oil and molasses and American grain or cake added, but this is a specialized industry of very limited extent. In the smaller towns no heavy beef was used, but fine veal and light beef carcasses were on sale, and mutton was often seen. In many farm - yards were rabbit warrens where rabbits were being raised for their meat. These I am told very largely take the place of chickens, which were high priced and more expensive to grow than rabbits. About twenty different types of cattle are found in the different provinces, each quite distinct from the others but more highly specialized. Each region seems to prefer its own breed so that there is not much crossing or mixture of breeds. The Charolais or large white breed and the Limosine or light yellow breed are each valued for work. Normandy cattle are specially valued for beef and butter, but are not thought to make superior work oxen. Some black and white Dutch cattle are seen in the north and these will doubtless be popular in replacing the cattle in the devastated areas. Sheep are more commonly of mixed breeding than cattle. The </seg>
            <seg id="p210">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 210 experiment station at Grignon is crossing the English mutton breeds, especially the Leicester, with the fine-wooled French breeds and recom - mending these to the French farmer. The famous Rambouillet or Delaine Merino which has been bred for 136 years on the government farm at Rambouillet is not popular in France but finds a ready market in the United States and South America. Many fine-wooled sheep are seen in France, doubtless tracing to the same foundation stock as the Rambouillet, but without the same purity of breeding and selection found at the government farm. Prior to 1914 France produced about 800,000 tons of beet sugar annually, mostly in the northern provinces, but three-fourths of the sugar beet area was overrun by the German army which destroyed or dismantled the factories, so that in 1918 only 200,000 tons were produced. This tremendous loss of sugar from German invasion is responsible for the present shortage in France. It is probable that 1920 will see this industry largely restored if their factories can be rebuilt in time to care for the crop. The methods and practices of French agriculture are built upon age-old customs intimately related to their land system. With each generation farms have grown smaller. Little land is sold and even the ownership of many small parcels by one farmer has seldom resulted in his allotting different parcels to his different children on a basis of values, but all tradition favors the subdivision of each parcel in passing from father to children. This subdivision has made many of these fields too small for economic operation by machine and horse power. Hand labor has been multiplied, intensive methods are generally practiced, vegetable gardening and the forcing of crops under glass are highly developed and labor is lavishly expended upon the crop to increase the yield or the revenue derived from the land. In habits the French peasant is thrifty; in labor he is prodigal. Both men and women work in the field, not only while young but through ma - turity and into old age. The effects of the war put an extra burden upon all and nothing but praise is heard for the manner in which the women of France have taken up the burden of labor while the men fought to preserve their country. The performance of farm work by women is not new and the labor available to operate the land is still abundant from our point of view, if the land could be organized in proper sized farms and operated more economically. I am told that in some of the devastated areas where the towns and landmarks are destroyed, an effort will be made to divide this land into about forty-acre farms and sell it to farmers upon easy terms, giv - ing them credit for the value of their devastated farms. It is not expected, however, that the farmer will permit such transfers to be - come general since he is bound to individual parcels of land by genera - tions of tradition and sentiment. </seg>
            <seg id="p211">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 211 French agriculture is productive of large acre yields secured through intensive methods but the labor income of the farmer is small. The thriftiness of the French peasant has made it possible for him in previous times to lay by savings out of his rather meagre income. His habits are frugal. He is industrious, conservative, and intensely loyal to his country. </seg>
            <seg id="p212">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 212 TUBERCULOSIS IN CATTLE Paper read by Dr. S. W. Alford, secretary of the Nebraska Veterinary Medical Association, before "Organized Agriculture," January, 1920 In taking up this subject of tuberculosis in cattle I cannot confine myself to cattle alone in order to give you a fair conception of what it means to the live stock industry of this country, but will mention hogs, chickens, and the human occasionally in order to make the subject more comprehensive. Tuberculosis is not a new disease by any means, in fact no dis - ease affecting either the human race or live stock has received more study nor is better understood. No doubt every cattle breeder in this room today has had more or less experience in one way or another with tuberculosis, and I dare say most of you have a practical understanding of the fundamental principles relative to this disease, so I will not go into detail on. certain points for that particular reason. A few years ago an educational campaign was in full blast against hog cholera and at present there are few hog raisers in the state who are not ac - quainted with the fundamental principles of the disease and its control as far as the disease is understood by our best scientists and research workers; and with the literature at hand, cattle raisers may become equally as well informed on the subject of tuberculosis, then it will be much easier for the state and federal government to carry on their eradication campaign which is receiving so much attention at the pres - ent. When this disease is more thoroughly understood by the stock raisers, they will be able to more readily comprehend what it means to them from a financial standpoint as well as from a standpoint of food con - servation and public health and they will more heartily appreciate the effort of the federal and state governments in trying to eradicate this disease. I don't want you to get the idea that they think you do not appreciate it as a whole, for you do, but there are a few, perhaps none at this meeting, who can't seem to realize what this really means to them in the long run. NATURE OF THE DISEASE Tuberculosis is a contagious and infectious disease caused by the bacillus of tuberculosis which can only be seen by the aid of a high power microscope. The germ gains entrance into the animal body through the mouth and is taken up by the absorbing system along the alimentary canal and may be carried and lodged into any part of the animal's carcass, starting a minute point of infection wherever the germ happens to lodge. It is usually a slow going disease, producing no spectacular symptoms as in foot-and-mouth disease, that would attract the attention of the owner. Because of its nature, the owner is </seg>
            <seg id="p213">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 213 led to believe that it is a disease of little concern and hence it is hard to interest him in the eradication of a disease of which he can see so little, until it is brought forcefully to his attention by suffering the losses which this disease is sure to bring to the owner of infected cattle sooner or later. Contrary to the belief of some who think tuberculosis does little damage, the government says "that the loss from tuberculosis is one of the heaviest taxes imposed upon our live stock industry, probably amounting to at least $40,000,000 annually in the United States." HOW SPREAD The greatest source of danger in a herd is the tuberculous cow, for sooner or later she begins to eliminate infection in the saliva, nasal discharges, fecal material or in the milk, in which way the infection is scattered over the premises and is picked up by other cattle and in due course of time this one cow has been the cause of most of the herd becoming infected, for as I have told you tuberculosis produces no alarming symptoms as a rule until the infection becomes generalized and the animal begins to decline, so the owner is unaware of this dis - ease creeping into his herd until much damage is done. Buying skimmed milk or butter milk which has not been properly pasteurized from a creamery has been heretofore the source of much tubercular infection. You can see how much damage one customer patronizing this creamery can do, if he is delivering milk containing tubercular infection, by having this milk run through the common separator and the skimmed milk all put into one large container thereby contaminating the entire product which is in turn distributed all over the neighborhood. You may know what the results will be if this product brought from the creamery is fed to calves and hogs. This danger is minimized, however, at present owing to the re - strictions placed on such product by the new dairy law recently put into force, by requiring such to be pasteurized and the cows to be tuberculin tested if their milk is sold to an establishment not having the facilities to pasteurize their product. This provision in the new dairy law requiring all cows to be tested from which milk is sold that is not pasteurized is going to be a greater factor in eradicating and controlling tuberculosis in that the centers of infection will be located in this manner which would not be found for a number of years under the accredited herd plan, as such herds cannot be signed up for the work on account of insufficient funds and lack of competent men to do the work, so you pure bred breeders should for this reason heartily approve the new dairy law in every respect, as a means of eliminating all sources of infection possible in your respective neighborhoods. </seg>
            <seg id="p214">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 214 Some are of the opinion that so long as a cow is not eliminating the infection through the udder that she is perfectly safe to leave in the herd, but some of the worst spreaders of infection are cows who perhaps never would eliminate the germ through the udder in the milk, in fact I have heard it said by authorities who should know, that only about 25% of all cows infected with tuberculosis do eliminate the germ in their milk; but the milk gets contaminated in the process of milking. The tubercular cow whose lungs are affected usually has a cough and when the material containing the infection is coughed up part of it is swallowed, which later passes out with the fecal material and when the cow lies down the hind quarters become soiled with the excreta and during the process of milking some of it, when dry, is accidently brushed off and falls into the milk, which can never be strained out. The saliva and nasal discharge containing the infection are smeared about the premises, in the feed troughs or bunks, in the watering tank, over the feed of the other cattle and much damage is done from this one animal being infected. A very common source of infection is the new animal purchased and brought into the herd by not first finding out for sure whether or not the animal is free of the disease. Many times a diseased animal is purchased unknowingly, and brought into a clean herd the results being the infection spreads to the rest of the herd and the trouble is not discovered until much damage is done and the premises thoroughly infected. SYMPTOMS It must be understood that tuberculosis is a disease which often gives no indication of its presence by external symptoms. Yet persons skilled and experienced in dealing with the disease among animals frequently, are able to detect certain abnormal conditions which lead them to pronounce the animal as probably affected with tuberculosis. A generally run down condition, accompanied with a cough, Is often con - sidered to be an indication of tuberculosis but is not a conclusive symptom. When tuberculosis is suspected it is always advisable to administer the tuberculin test as soon as possible. As the disease often involves the lymphatic glands in various parts of the body, an examination of such glands as can be felt in the living animal is sometimes helpful in diagnosing the disease. The glands of the throat, udder and point of the shoulder often present an abnormal condition such as an enlargement or hardening at that particular part. Animals affected with tuberculosis in advanced stages often show a "staring" coat and a general unthrifty condition. When the throat glands of an animal are affected it often holds its head in an abnormal position to relieve the pressure which causes difficult breathing. In - creased respiration is often noted when the lungs or lymphatic glands </seg>
            <seg id="p215">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 215 of the thoracic cavity are affected. When certain glands located close to the esophagus or gullet are extensively affected the animal may bloat due to the pressure on the esophagus preventing the escape of gases formed in the rumen. Diarrhea is evident in cases in which the infection has extended to and involved the alimentary canal. The symptoms mentioned, though typical, must not always be expected when animals are tuberculous; animals that are extensively diseased are often in apparently perfect physical condition. POST-MORTEM LESIONS It may not be advisable to attempt a description of the post - mortem appearance of a tubercular carcass to you gentlemen but in order to give you some idea as to what tuberculosis looks like I will attempt to describe it in a brief comprehensive manner. In a carcass where the disease has become extensive and generalized it is easily recognized, but where the disease is located in a few places it is not so easily recognized and sometimes defies the skill of an expert in locat - ing the lesions. The disease makes its appearance to the naked eye by forming at the point of infection a tubercle or nodule varying from minute in size to that of a common water pail in extreme cases. These nodules or lesions may be found in any part of the carcass and when the nodules or tubercles are cut open they contain tubercular pus some - times of a liquid nature, other times of cheesy consistency and still again of a gritty-like nature, so that when the knife is passed through it feels as though it contains sand. These nodules may be found in the udder, lungs, liver, spleen, intestines or on the inside of the chest cavity, completely covering the ribs in extreme cases. I would like to impress this particular point on your mind in regard to the post-mortem of a tubercular carcass in that all animals which have reacted to the tuberculin test do not show lesions of tuberculosis discernible to the naked eye for the simple reason that they may have become recently infected and the disease has not developed to that stage as yet or the disease may be localized in some remote or obscure lymph gland and could be easily overlooked by the one making the inspection. METHOD OF DIAGNOSIS There is only one practical and reliable method of diagnosing tuberculosis and that is the tuberculin test. Of course there are labora - tory tests and animal inoculation tests which prove quite satisfactory but for practical purposes the tuberculin test is the most satisfactory and reliable. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 216 The tuberculin test may be administered in three different ways, the subcutaneous or thermal test, the intradermal test, and the ophthal - mic or eye test. The subcutaneous or thermal test, which is the test recognized by this state and by the federal bureau of animal industry, consists of taking three preliminary temperatures at least two hours apart to ascertain the condition of the animal to be tested and if normal the regulated dose of tuberculin is injected after which one allows eight hours to elapse, then temperatures are taken, beginning with the eighth hour following the injection of tuberculin, every two hours until seven post temperatures are taken, which requires twenty-four hours to administer this test at the shortest time. If at this time there is any question in regard to the test on any animal the temperatures on the one in question should continue until the veterinarian making the test is satisfied. Any deviation from this rule to any degree would not be considered by the state and federal authorities a perfectly reliable test. Should the animal injected have tuberculosis in any form the temperature will rise the next day following the injection of tuberculin with other systemic disturbances that only a trained veterinarian is competent to interpret in many instances. The tuberculin used in the thermal test is a laboratory product prepared scientifically and of a standard potency and in the hands of skilled persons is a reliable agent for detecting tuberculosis in animals. It contains no living tubercle bacilli but is a product of the growth of tubercle bacilli properly mixed with a substance on which it has grown and properly diluted and preserved. No harm can result to healthy animals from the proper application of tuberculin even in doses many times greater than the regular ones used. As a result of the tuberculin test I will say, however, that there is a tendency for the test to cause the disease to become more generalized in infected animals while other - wise the disease might remain localized some considerable time before causing any trouble to the animal infected. The use of tuberculin by untrained persons is to be discouraged for many times the results are misinterpreted or a reaction is unobserved and tubercular animals are left in the herd for this reason. Tuberculin by its immunizing properties can cause tuberculous animals to fail to respond to its application at another time, therefore it may be mis - used by unscrupulous persons. Some are of the opinion that the tuberculin test is unreliable, which is not the case according to statis - tics of the U. S. Bureau of Animal Industry as well as the State Bureau of Animal Industry. Out of the total of 51,210 cattle tested which reacted to the tuberculin test in this country applied by state and federal veterinarians 49,414 showed the disease discernible to the naked eye on post-mortem examination, or 96.5 per cent, and of the remainder almost one-fourth showed it in microscopic examination thus </seg>
            <seg id="p217">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 217 proving the reliableness of the test when properly applied. The post - mortem record of reactors in Nebraska the past year shows a per - centage of about 98 per cent perfect. Some breeders have become pretty well posted on the use and action of tuberculin and are making use of it in disposing of tubercu - lous animals in their herd. This is not a common practice however, but is a source of considerable trouble to our federal and state authorities in trying to control this disease and protect the live stock owners against such an unscrupulous method. Veterinarians are also put in a bad light before the public and authorities of the state into which these animals are shipped by such unfair methods of some cattle owners by administering a tuberculin test in good faith and later when these animals are retested at the end of 60 days quarantine period if coming into Nebraska some or all of them are found to be tubercular. I am not placing all the blame for this kind of work on the cattle breeder entirely for we have had and do have at the present time veterinarians who willfully and knowingly make bogus health certificates for tubercular animals, as well as cattle men who knowingly and willingly buy tuberculin and plug their cattle a few days before the veterinarian is to administer the test in order that he may hold onto or slip his neighbor diseased cows, but with the check on these animals the state and federal authorities has such veterinarians will be and are being picked out and taken off the authorized list and not allowed to do any of this kind of work. As long as tuberculin may be obtained at any drug store we will continue to have just such things to contend with and not until the sale of tuberculin is strictly con - trolled by the state or federal authorities will we be able to eliminate the danger of having this tuberculin used for the purpose of slipping tuberculous animals by the tuberculin test. Tuberculin is a scientific diagnostic agent and should only be in the hands of those who are capable and trained in its use for which it was intended. The intradermal test consist's of the injection of a concentrated tuberculin into the fold of skin at the base of the tail, which produces a circumscribed swelling in from 48 to 96 hours following, if the ani - mal is affected with tuberculosis, but if the animals injected are healthy there is no change whatever. When made by one who has become skilled in its application, this test is very accurate and is used in this state occasionally in wild or range cattle which cannot be easily con - fined, which is necessary for the thermal test. It appears to me that the intradermal test is very practical under all conditions on account of its requiring less time, is cheaper and one man may be able to test any number of cattle while with the tem - perature test 30 or 40 is about all one man can handle at one time, and with the tuberculosis eradication work being extended as it is there should be some method adopted whereby more cattle can be tested in </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a shorter period of time. The main objection to the test, however, is that some veterinarians have as yet not had sufficient experience to be skilled in its application so that they feel that they can risk their judgment on the results obtained, but many veterinarians are using the intradermal test along with the subcutaneous test as a means of checking their thermal test as well as acquainting themselves thoroughly with its application which is a very scientific piece of work, and it is hoped that at some future time the intradermal test will be recognized, but the thermal test is the official test. The ophthalmic or eye test is another means of detecting tubercu - losis in animals and consists of the introduction of tuberculin into the eye which when animals are affected with tuberculosis produces a very pronounced inflammation of the eye with considerable discharge of pus. This test, however, is not used a great deal except as a check on the other tests and in my estimation is not so reliable as the thermal or intradermal test. DISPOSAL OF REACTORS The state law requires that all reactors to the tuberculin test be tagged in the left ear and branded with the letter T on the left jaw and quarantined until disposed of at a packing house under federal inspection within fifteen days after the test, except for special reasons as inability to ship one may obtain an extension of time from the state bureau of animal industry. It is not good policy, however, to keep such animals around the premises unless they are of exceptional breed - ing quality, under which condition one may get a special permit from the state bureau of animal industry to keep this animal under special quarantine in order that its breeding qualities may be perpetuated in its offspring. This, as you no doubt have heard, is the Bang system of keeping tuberculous animals. The calves from tubercular cows are perfectly healthy as the disease is not inherited and if taken away as soon as they are dropped and not allowed to nurse and placed in clean quarters will never develop tuberculosis unless by some means they become infected at a later period. This practice, however, Is expensive and inconvenient for as a rule the owner is not equipped to do so and an owner of one of the largest pure bred Holstein herds in the United States who had tried this system for a period of four years said that he would not advise anybody to adopt such a system. Some cattle owners, if they have animals react to the tuberculin test, insist on keeping the animals for a retest for some reason or another. This is not advisable, however, for if an animal gives a typical reaction to the tuberculin test at one time she should be disposed of in the ordinary manner and the premises cleaned and disinfected. There has been considerable misunderstanding in regard to the post-mortem report on reactors sent in for slaughter in that the average person is </seg>
            <seg id="p219">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 219 not able to interpret or understand the post-mortem report issued by the federal inspector. When the owner reads his reports that the reactors to the tuberculin test passed for food he takes it for granted that they were not affected with tuberculosis. In order to illustrate this, there were 13,821 cattle retained for tuberculosis in Omaha in 1919 out of which only 1,805 were condemned for food, which left 12,016 which were passed for food, having had tuberculosis to a mild degree not sufficient to warrant condemnation. The state bureau of animal industry is adopting the method of sending every owner of a tubercular cow after slaughter of same, a post-mortem report with a letter of explanation so he will be able to interpret the findings correctly. PREVENTION As a matter of prevention to the party who has no tuberculosis in his herd, should always insist upon, when purchasing an animal, the privilege of retesting this animal within 60 days regardless of where he is located and that if the animal reacts it reverts back to its original owner at his expense. This would not be necessary in Nebraska, how - ever, because the law requiring a 60-day retest on all pure bred ani - mals coming into the state would take care of this, but it does not compel the original owner to take the animal back if tubercular. This animal should be held in quarantine on the premises until the owner is thoroughly satisfied that it is free of tuberculosis before it is allowed to mingle with the rest of the herd. That is the principal source of infection in clean herds, but in herds that are infected with tubercu - losis it requires a different procedure entirely from a preventive stand - point. If the herd is tested and tuberculosis is found the reactors should be disposed of according to law and the premises cleaned and disinfected under the supervision of representatives of the state bureau of animal industry sent out for that purpose at state's expense, after which the herd should be retested every six months as long as reactors are found, but when once free of infection it is not advisable to test more than once each year. Sunlight is the worst enemy of the tubercle bacillus, destroying it in 20 minutes, so you can all see the part sun - light may play in destroying infection on a premises if you will only give it a chance. The eradication of tuberculosis in cattle on the premises will be largely responsible for the eradication of tuberculosis in hogs, as that is the principal source of infection in hogs where they are allowed access to the droppings or fed milk from tubercular cows without pasteurization. Should the hogs on the premises be infected they should be marketed and if any are kept for breeding purposes they should be tested with the intradermal test which is very reliable. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 220 After one has freed his premises of tuberculosis by testing and retesting and disinfection he should follow the same procedure and use the same precaution in introducing new stock into his herd as the person does who has never had any tuberculosis on his premises. LESIONS In order that you may more readily comprehend what tuberculosis means to the live stock industry and food supply of the country, I would like to quote some statistics from the federal bureau of animal industry as well as the state bureau of animal industry relative to the number of animals condemned for tuberculosis and to note the per - centage decline in the last three years since the tuberculosis eradication campaign has been in operation. These statistics are based on pack - ing establishments under federal inspection and only 65% of the ani - mals slaughtered in the United States are slaughtered under federal supervision and it is estimated that the percentage of those slaughtered in establishments not under federal supervision runs still higher for much of the questionable material is sold to such establishments so it is fair to assume that these statistics of the federal bureau of animal industry represent approximately 50% of the tubercular animals slaughtered annually in the United States. There has been in the past ten years not including 1919, 334,133 cattle and 520,340 hogs condemned for tuberculosis in packing houses under federal inspection. That would be approximately 445 train loads, figuring 25 cars to the train, or 11,137 car loads, figuring 30 head to the car, of cattle, and 297 train loads, figuring 25 cars to the train or 7,433 car loads, figuring 70 head to the car, of hogs, con - demned in the past ten years not including 1919 in the United States and mind you that only represents about one-half of the stuff con - demned for tuberculosis. In the year 1918 there were retained for tuberculosis approxi - mately two and one-half million hogs, of which 60,000 were con - demned. In the same year approximately 223,000 cattle were retained for tuberculosis and 40,000 condemned. I think the reason for the higher percentage condemned, of beef carcasses retained for tubercu - losis than that of hog, is that cattle are kept much longer than hogs as a rule before marketing, giving the disease time to become more generalized. Can you imagine the enormous quantity of meat food that repre - sents and do you think for a minute the packer stands this loss? Does the man who ships the packer tubercular animals think he is handing the packer a lemon? You can't figure that way for a minute for he knows just exactly what percentage of his stuff he buys on foot will be condemned next year and he regulates his profits accordingly, bat the </seg>
            <seg id="p221">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 221 man who sells him good stuff shares the loss equally with he who sells the bad stuff, so it behooves the man with good, clean stuff to help the state and federal authorities clean up this disease causing so much waste of food as well as being a menace to public health. The packers have adopted the method of discriminating against hogs and cattle from certain localities on account of such a high per - centage condemned for tuberculosis, and the federal authorities have adopted the practice of notifying the state authorities from which such shipments originate, of consignments badly infected with tuberculosis and the state authorities investigate the premises selling such animals, with the view of getting the owner to understand what he should do to get rid of this disease. According to the report of the Sanitary Commission of the Chi - cago Live Stock Exchange for the last three years, of the cattle and hogs slaughtered in the eight middle west markets including Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, East St. Louis, South St. Joseph, St. Paul, Sioux City and Milwaukee we find the percentage of cattle condemned for tuberculosis reduced from .52% in 1917 to .38% in 1918 and to .31% in 1919 and the percentage of hogs condemned for tuberculosis reduced from 24% in 1917 to .20% in 1918 and to .17% in 1919 and the Chi - cago Exchange makes this statement: "If the percentage of con - demnations in cattle killed at the Chicago market during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919 (.57%) had been the same as in 1918 (.78%) the number condemned in 1919 would have been 20,232 cattle or 5,680 more than were condemned, worth $100 each would be $568,000. If the percentage of condemnations in cattle killed at the Chicago market in 1919 (.57%) had been the same as in 1917 (.94%) the number con - demned in 1919 would have been 24,382, 9,830 more than were con - demned; worth $100 each would be $983,000.00. Had the percentage of condemnations in hogs at the Chicago market been the same in 1919 (.21%) as in 1918 (.27%) the number condemned in 1919 would have been 22,572 or 4,673 more than were condemned worth $40 each, $186,920. Had the percentage of con - demnations in hogs at Chicago in 1919 (.21%) been the same as in 1917 (.34%) the number condemned would have been 28,424 or 10,535 more than were condemned in 1919 worth at $40 each, $421,400.00. The reduced percentage of condemnations on both cattle and hogs at Chicago in 1919 effected a total saving of $754,920.00 as compared with 1918, and $1,404,400.00 as compared with 1917, assuming that the losses on cattle and hogs retained for tuberculosis but not condemned would offset the value of the salvage on condemned animals. On the same basis of valuation, the reduced percentage of con - demnations on both cattle and hogs at these eight markets In 1919 effected a total saving of $2,136,860.00 as compared with 1917. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 222 It is apparent that the tuberculin testing of herds of breeding cattle, the elimination of reactors and the adoption of better methods of sanitation is reducing the prevalence of tuberculosis in both cattle and hogs. In view of the facts I have just presented, is it not time for the government to step in and call a halt on such a waste of human food and adopt such measures to protect the cattle industry against total destruction and preserve the public health against a disease that is positively known to be so destructive to children? Are we not inter - ested enough in the welfare of our future generation to guard them against such a dreadful disease that causes the death of thousands of children annually? Are you men not interested in the eradication of a disease, that if left unmolested, is sure to destroy your herds sooner or later? You may ask the question "What can we do?" In answer I will say that the State and Federal Governments under the super - vision of its bureaus of animal industry offer a solution to the prob - lem in the . tuberculosis eradication work and the "Accredited Herd" plan. The question may be asked, "Can tuberculosis be eradicated and what is the 'Accredited Herd' plan?" Did the Federal Bureau of Animal Industry not eradicate foot-and-mouth disease on two or three different occasions and has it not reduced the tick infested area in the south to about half its original size in the short time it has taken up the fight against a disease that caused the cattle owners heavy loss annually and predict that the tick will be practically exterminated within five years more? Of course tuberculosis, on account of its wide distribution, will be a much greater task and we may not live to see this accomplished; but even if it takes 100 years is it not better than to let this disease destroy our live stock industry? The eradication of tuberculosis in hogs and chickens will, to a very large extent, automatically be brought about by the eradication of the disease in cattle as that is the chief source of infection in them. THE "ACCREDITED HERD" PLAN The "accredited herd" plan is an agreement adopted by the Fed - eral Bureau of Animal Industry at the recommendation of a joint committee representing the pure bred associations of the United States and the United States Live Stock Sanitary Association. This plan was proposed for adoption at their meeting in Chicago, December 1, 1917, and since then it has received the approval of practically every pure bred live stock association and agricultural paper of the country. The original function of this plan was to lay a foundation on which to build a more perfect system of eventually eradicating tubercu - losis from the United States. It was absolutely essential that the </seg>
            <seg id="p223">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 223 government take hold of this proposition and start from the ground floor and build up state by state until today every state in the Union has accepted and adopted the plan and it is in actual operation in forty-five states. The plan is a three-cornered agreement between the State and Federal Governments and the owner of herds of cattle. When the owner signs up for this work he must agree to place his entire herd under the supervision of the state and federal office to be tuberculin tested as often as the authorities deem necessary, to dispose of all reactors in a satisfactory manner and to clean and disinfect the premises, under supervision, when tubercular cattle are found thereon. In turn, the State and Federal Governments agree to furnish a veteri - narian to test his cattle at no expense to the owner; also to pay for all reacting cattle up to a certain amount. The cattle are appraised at market value, taking, also, into consideration their breeding and dairy value and the State and Federal Governments pay two-thirds of the appraised value less the amount received from the salvage, not to exceed $100.00 for each pure bred and $50.00 for each grade. For example, a pure bred cow that has reacted is appraised at $250.00. She is shipped to market, and if fat and passed for food products on post-mortem examination she may salvage $100.00. This amount is deducted from the appraised value of $250.00, leaving $150.00. The State Government will then pay the owner $50.00 and the Federal Government a like amount, the owner standing the loss of the remaining $50.00. Owners whose herds, on two annual or three semi-annual tubercu - lin tests and physical examinations by State and Federal officials, have been found free from tuberculosis, and who have strictly complied with all the rules and regulations of the plan receive a certificate for a tuberculosis-free, accredited herd issued by the United States and Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry. The idea and advantage of accrediting herds of cattle found to be free from tuberculosis has gained wide publicity and popularity among the cattle breeders of the country during the past year. They appreciate the fact that a certificate of approval indorsed by the State of Nebraska, and further indorsed by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry gives prospective purchasers confidence that the ani - mals are free from the disease, and they are in consequence willing to pay a considerable advance in price for such animals. Having an "Accredited Herd" is also of material value to owners wishing to ship animals interstate, as all that is necessary for them to do is to make application to the Bureau of Animal Industry for a certificate setting forth the fact that such animals are free from tuberculosis and this certificate will be recognized by any state into which such animals are to be shipped. </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD. OF AGRICULTURE On December 1, 1918, one year after the adoption of thfe accredited herd plan, there were 204 accredited herds in the United States with an aggregate of 5,743 cattle. On March 31, 1919, when herd list No. 2 was issued there were 782 accredited herds representing 19,000 cattle. At that time there were also 6,535 herds with an aggregate of approxi - mately 80,000 cattle which had passed one successful tuberculin test without reactors, in preparation for being accredited. On December 1, 1919, there were 1,855 herds with a total of 35,204 cattle fully accredited, and 12,838 herds representing a total of 191,428 cattle that have passed the initial test successfully in their advance to full certification. While the data furnished give a fair estimation of the progress of the work, it is a very feeble exposition of the sentiment of live stock owners of this nation relative to the tuberculosis problem. One of the most disturbing features of the work at this time is the inability to keep pace with the demand for herd tests. Most un - fortunately while the demand for accredited herd work was increasing it was found necessary to reduce the force of inspectors employed by the Federal Bureau of Animal Industry on account of insufficient funds provided for operating expenses. The fund provided for payment of indemnities has only been slightly drawn on because there are not now a sufficient number of inspectors to test cattle to make it possible to pay that amount of indemnity to cattle owners for tuberculous animals. The State Bureau of Animal Industry, in order that the cattle owner, whose interests it represents, could have the advantage of this work signed up the agreement with the Federal Bureau of Animal Industry in September, 1918, and two men were placed on this work at that time. Since then one man has been added. The Federal Bureau of Animal Industry has two men in the field working on this plan in co-operation with the state men. There were January 1, 1920, nine fully accredited herds in this state and 226 herds which are being tested toward certification, and approximately sixty agreements signed up and accepted for this work, so you can see how popular this plan has really become already. Unfortunately the law governing the appropriation for the payment of indemnity to owners of cattle condemned by the state for being tuberculous does not permit the payment of this .indemnity unless the herd is accredited under state and federal supervision or is in the process of being accredited on the co-operative plan. The only feasible way to remedy this is for Nebraska to appropriate sufficient money for indemnifying owners for all tubercular cattle on the same basis as that adopted by the Federal and State Governments in the accredited herd plan. </seg>
            <seg id="p225">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 225 I will read you the following resolution adopted by the Nebraska Veterinary Medical Association, December 10, 1919, relative to this particular point. "Recommend that proper steps be taken to provide a sufficient fund for the indemnifying of owners of cattle slaughtered by order of the State, as the result of being tuberculous, believing this to be a most important, fair and impartial step in the successful eradication of this disease." Some owners of dairy herds coming under the new dairy law have seen fit to sign up for the accredited herd plan in order to receive indemnity, with no intention of fulfilling the agreement. Such unfair tactics, the local authorities must necessarily guard against and some may feel as though they are too particular in taking on herds for this work when in fact with all their carefulness they find themselves holding agreements with such parties. The idea of the State Bureau of Animal Industry and local Federal authorities is to sign an agree - ment with no one for this work, unless he be conscientious in ful - filling every agreement therein as closely as possible and so far the work has been confined chiefly to pure bred herds or herds containing pure breds. There is every inducement for the pure bred breeder who sus - picions he has tubercular animals in his herd to get into this accredited herd plan, as those who are in the plan cannot buy their animals from him without having them tested and those who are not in the plan, if wide-awake on this question, will buy them subject to a 60-day retest, so it makes it all the more necessary that he get into this plan, clean up his herd, and receive indemnity for reactors while other - wise he stands the total loss. 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p226">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 226 THE SOIL RESOURCES OF NEBRASKA By G. E. CONDRA, Director of the Nebraska Conservation and Soil Survey The University of Nebraska This brief report, prepared to answer some of the many questions which the department receives in regard to the soil resources of Nebraska, is not complete enough to take the place of the detailed soil surveys, such as have been made of twenty-seven counties of the state. It is general and should be so considered. The reader should keep in mind the fact that Nebraska is large and diverse, having an area of 77,510 square miles, an altitude rising from 840 feet in the southeast to 5,340 feet near the western border, land forms varying from smooth plains to mountainous areas, more than 100 kinds of soil, and a rainfall decreasing from 33 inches in the south - east corner to 16 inches at the Wyoming line. County Soil Survey Reports — The State Conservation and Soil Survey, in co-operation with the U. S. Bureau of Soils, has studied, mapped, and described 27 counties of Nebraska. Each county report includes a detailed soil map and shows such cultural features as roads, towns, and the locations of houses in the country. The various soil types are described and their adaptations to agriculture are shown. The reports on these areas are of use in farm management, road grading, road rout - ing, real estate, and for general educational purposes. They are pub - lished by the government and are free upon request as long as they last. District Reports — The State Survey has separated Nebraska into 14 areas or districts on which Conservation and Soil Survey reports are to be made when the detailed surveys have been completed in the re - spective areas. These reports are to be published by the state and they should have considerable value to the people of Nebraska. Soil Classification — The field work results in the determination of the kinds of soil, and grouping them under series. First, the lands are classified into kinds according to their origin, then the soils on these lands are grouped into series on the basis of similarity in color, struc - ture, origin, mode of formation, topography, and drainage. The series are divided into soil types on the basis of agricultural value, and texture which is determined by the relative amounts of various materials such as clay, silt, sand, and gravel. Clay is the finest material; it has no grit and is very plastic when wet. Silt U a large content of most agricultural soils in the state; it i» </seg>
            <seg id="p227">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 227 more friable than clay. There are a number of silty soils, depending upon the percentages of silt, clay, and sand which they contain. Sand of four grades, determined by the diameter of the particles, is recognized in soil classification. It is much coarser than clay or silt. Loam contains silt and clay and more or less sand. A typical loam has less than 20% clay and less than 50% silt and, some sand. An excess of any material such as clay, silt, sand, or gravel would distinguish the soil as clay loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly loam. A very large area of Nebraska is occupied by silt loam soils. On a basis of soil, topography, and general economic development, Nebraska has three quite distinct regions or provinces — the Loess, Sand - hill, and High Plains, each with the subdivisions shown by Figure 1. THE LOESS REGION This division, so named on account of its well-known subsoil, occupies a little more than the southeast half of the state and is one of the best developed agricultural regions in the United States. Most Nebraskans have seen loess. It is exposed in many rail - road cuts and excavations (Figure 2) at Omaha, Plattsmouth, Ne - braska City, and other places, and extends through most of the upland of the region. The loess extends, as smaller areas, southward into Kansas, and eastward into Iowa and Missouri. Kinds of Loess — There are three principal kinds of loess in Ne - braska, known as the plains, terrace, and Missouri River bluff land loesses. A fourth kind, less extensive, occurs on some of the weathered surfaces of the drift deposits of southeastern Nebraska, southern Iowa, northern Missouri, and northeastern Kansas. The loesses, though differing in origin, are very similar in physical properties, hence, for the most part, they are considered collectively in this report. Physical Properties of Loess — The most distinctive features of loess are the buff color, massive appearance, fine texture, and ability to stand nearly vertically in bluffs and other exposures. At many places, the material is broken by small vertical tubes, and may contain small con - cretions, snail-like shells, and bodies of sand. The buff color is due principally to iron oxide which acts as a weak cement. In parts of Nebraska, the loess has considerable range in color, especially in verti - cal sections. The loess is generally, but erroneously, known as yellow clay. Technically, it is not clay, but principally silt with some clay and fine sand. It is, therefore, a silt loam. Though there are local differences in the texture of the loess, as shown by vertical sections, the material becomes more sandy and a little coarser, as a rule, as one passes west - ward and northwestward across the Loess Region. </seg>

            <seg id="p229">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 229 Divisions of the Loess Region — Not far back in geological time, the Loess Region was a nearly smooth plain, underlain with drift or glacial deposits in its eastern part and by thick layers of sand in the central and western parts. This original plain has been eroded and farther modified by wind and streams, separating it into a number of distinct land divisions which we now call the loess plains, rough land Figure 2. Vertical section of Nebraska's deep subsoil areas, wind-formed hill areas, drift hills, bench lands, and alluvial plain*. Though they are in the Loess Region, two of the subdivisions and part of another, have very little loess. They are the alluvial plains, drift hills, and the rough, stony lands which, combined, occupy about 10,700 square miles or a little more than one-fourth of the Loess Region. </seg>
            <seg id="p230">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 230 LOESS PLAINS These are the nearly level remnants of the original upland plain (Figure 3). Their total area is about 14,100 square miles. The largest plain is in the southern part of the state, between Gosper and Saunders counties, lying in a general way between the Platte, Big Blue, and Republican valleys. The surface of this plain is quite even, with a broad landscape modified by small drainage-ways, shallow basins, and low knolls. Though the basins hold water intermittently, the drainage of the plain, both surface and underground, is quite good as a whole. There are a number of small loess plains in Nebraska with locations north of Ogallala (on the divide of west- central Keith County), south ot the Platte at Sutherland; in southwestern Lincoln County, southeastern Chase, and various parts of Hayes County; northeastern Dundy, north - western Hitchcock, southern Frontier, northwestern Red Willow; parts of the divide of Red Willow and Furnas counties lying between the .Beaver and Republican valleys; the upland between Broken Bow and Sargent; northern Buffalo County; small areas north of Ravenna, six miles south of North Loup, between St. Paul and Boelus, west of Wolbach, and southwest of Spalding; the nearly flat uplands of Boone, Madison, Wayne, Cuming, Dodge, Douglas, Washington, and other eastern and northeastern counties. Several small plains of this kind occur east of the Big Blue, as in Seward, northern Gage, southern Lancaster, cen - tral Cass, and eastern Johnson counties. The small loess plains resemble in most respects the large one south of the Platte. LOESS PLAIN SOILS The plains are mantled with 25 to about 100 feet of silt loam, known as the plains loess, the texture of which is quite uniform, but becomes somewhat lighter westward and on knolls. The loess is not a soil. It is one of the richest soil-forming deposits, and through slight modifications, gives rise to some of the state's most uniform and produc - tive silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and fine sandy loam soils. The principal soils developed upon the plains loess are the Qrundy silt loam. Holdrege silt loam, Colby silt loam, and Scott silt loam. Some of the small areas in Dodge, Wayne, and other northeastern counties are occu - pied by the Marshall silt loam (fiat phase). The loess plains are dark silt loam soil areas. The Grundy silt loam occupies most of the eastern and central upland plains as in Butler, Polk, York, Hamilton, Fillmore, Saline, and Clay counties and parts of Jefferson, Thayer, Nuckolls, Adams, Howard, Gage, Cass, Madison,' and several other counties. Formerly, it was called the "flat phase" of the Marshall tilt loam. The surface soil is </seg>
            <seg id="p231">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 231 a dark brown, heavy silt loam, 8 to 15 inches deep, friable and rich in organic matter. The upper subsoil consists of brown silt loam, consider - ably heavier than the surface soil and passes abruptly into dark, heavy clay mottled with yellow and brown. This heavy part of the subsoil, sometimes called "hard pan" or "gumbo," is underlain with a more friable part of the subsoil passing gradually into the unmodified loess. The Grundy soils grade locally between silt loam and clay loam. The silt loam, however, has the larger distribution. The Grundy soils grow wheat, corn, alfalfa, oats, and other leading crops and support stock raising. Much of the land is in cultivation. The Holdrege silt loam, typical of Phelps County in the vicinity of Holdrege, is dark and friable to a depth of about 15 inches, passing into a heavier granular silty clay loam, which grades through a dark brown to brown granular silty clay loam to silty clay to a depth of 28 inches. Below this is a mellow, silt loam of light gray color which continues through and below the three-foot section. The lower sub - soil usually is calcareous. Figure 3. View on Loess Plains of Fillmore County, showing large fields of corn, wheat and alfalfa. The Holdrege silt loam represents several variations. It resembles the Marshall silt loam at places. Its darker color, greater depth, and less heavy layer in the upper subsoil are the distinguishing features between the Grundy and Holdrege soils. The Holdrege silt loam occupies considerable areas between Adams </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and Gosper counties. Farther west, it grades into the loam and very line sandy loam which are well represented on the small plains between Gosper County and the eastern part of Chase County. The Holdrege soils support extensive wheat farming, but are cul - tivated to corn, alfalfa, oats, and other crops. Much of the land is in cultivation. The Colby silt loam is best developed on the central and western loess plains where the rainfall is 26 inches or less. It consists of a brown to light brown silt loam, grading through a grayish-brown silt loam to 15 inches, below which, to a depth of three feet, is a light gray, floury silt loam. The subsoil from 18 inches down is calcareous, due to dis - seminated calcium carbonate and small calcareous concretions. The Colby silt loam is lighter in color, more friable and lower in humus than the Marshall, Orundy, and Holdrege silt loams. It occurs on the plains proper and on slopes leading to the rough lands. There are places in this latter position where the type grades into a shallow phase, but where the subsoil is lighter, a fine sandy loam or even a sandy loam is formed as in southeastern Hall County and on the slope lands westward to Chase County. The Colby soils are cultivated to wheat, oats, corn and other crops or used for grazing. The Scott silt loam, or basin soil of the region, is poorly drained. Its distribution is scattered in most counties on the Loess Plains, in areas varying from a few acres to a section or more. Some of the largest bodies of this soil are in western Seward, and in York, Clay, Fillmore, and Phelps counties. The surface soil of the Scott silt loam is dark, high in organic matter, hard when dry and plastic when wet. The change to the upper subsoil is gradual. At a depth of 20 to 24 inches, the subsoil becomes lighter in color and ash-like. Below 36 inches is a yellowish, friable silt loam. The subsoil is calcareous and impregnated locally with alkali salts. In some basins, the Scott silt loam grades into silty clay loam and clay loam. Much of the Scott soils is poorly drained and retained in the natural sod for grazing. Reclaimed areas are successfully farmed to corn, wheat, and other crops. DEVELOPMENT OF LOESS PLAINS The principal factors in the development of these areas are the soils, amount of rainfall, and a good well water supply, as is shown in the road locations, forms of agriculture, density of population, and the towns and cities. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 233 Wagon roads are mostly on section lines. There is most grazing to the west where the rainfall is least, and on the drouthy soils. The Rcott, or basin soils, where drained, are cultivated; elsewhere, they are used for grazing. The Colby silt loam is a good wheat soil and is quite successfully cultivated to corn and forage crops, especially when there is the normal rainfall during the growing season. The Orundy and Holdrege soils and the flat phase of the Marshall produce good yields of wheat, oats, alfalfa, corn, vegetables, some fruits, and other crops most years and support successful stock raising. The Loess Plains rank very high in wheat production. The Orundy silt loam presents a big problem in its heavy upper subsoil. This layer is accountable in part for the short crops of dry years which have been too largely attributed to hot winds. The correc - tion of this soil condition, if it can be made, will be worth millions of dollars to the state. Viewed as a whole, the Loess Plains lie well and are absolutely stone free and easy to farm. The leading soils are productive without artificial fertilizers. Humus can be replenished at most places by growing legumes, and by the use of barnyard manures. The farming operations are carried on in a big way and improved machinery is used generally. The density of rural population on the Loess Plains is greatest to the east. Farms average about 160 acres here and gradually larger farther west where there are a number of large holdings. Both country and lown are well developed on the Loess Plains. The broad stretches of country, modified by big fields of grain and alfalfa, and by groves, roads on section lines, and modern farm homes, are most beautiful. Land Values in the Loess Plains range between $100 and $500 or more an acre, depending upon the soil, amount of rainfall, and improve - ments. Small tracts well located near cities have sold higher. References: Persons wishing further information in regard to the Loess Plain soils, should secure and consult the soil survey reports of Polk, Gage, Fillmore, Seward, Hall, and Phelps counties. These, and other similar reports, are free upon request from the U. S. Bureau of Soils, Washington, D. C, as long as they last. See also, pp. 262-270, Report, Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, 1914. ROUGH LANDS These are the canyon areas, river bluffs, and rough stony lands. Canyon areas are best developed at the western edge of the Loess Plains. The bluff lands proper are the steep valleysides formed by rivers and landslides. They are well shown along the Missouri. Rough stony lands occur mostly on the valley slopes of the Republican, Little Blue, Big Blue, Big Nemaha, lower course of the Platte, and at places along the Missouri. </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE CANYON AREAS These, covering about 1,500 square miles (Figure 4), are largely in Lincoln, Hayes, Frontier, Hitchcock, and Gosper counties, and in parts of Phelps, Red Willow, Furnas and Dawson counties. Their steep - sided valleys (canyons) separate the areas into many flats or rem - nants of the original surface, making small, disconnected loess plains. In most places, the canyons being close, make the country very rough and difficult for travel and farming, yet there are locations where the flats are of considerable size. In other places, as near the river valleys where the flat divides have been reduced by erosion, the country is very hilly, as at the edge of the upland south of Gothenburg and southeast of North Platte. Figure 4. A small loess canyon of western Phelps County. The leading soil on the rougher parts of the canyon areas is the broken phase of the Colby silt loam. This consists of a light brown to brownish gray silt loam four to five inches deep, underlain by gray silt loam, which becomes light colored and floury at 20 to 36 inches. Locally, the Colby soils grade, on the rough lands, into fine sandy loam and sandy loam. Practically all rough land of the canyon areas is used for pasture. It grows nutritious grasses which afford excellent grazing. The small flats between the canyons are occupied by the Colby silt loam, Holdrege tilt loam, and Holdrege loam. These soils, though badly separated by canyons, are farmed to wheat, corn, forage crops, or pastured. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 235 Land Values in the canyon areas are comparatively low because much of the country is broken. They range between $15 and $100 or more an acre, depending upon the amounts of pasture land and farm land on a farm. BLUFF LANDS These border the Missouri (Figure 5), Platte, Elkhorn, Repub - lican, and other large valleys of the Loess Region, but they are only narrow, discontinuous belts between the alluvial bottom lands and the hilly uplands, or between the bottom lands and edges of the Loess Plains. The approximate total area of the bluff lands in the Loess Region is a little more than 1,000 square miles. Some of the bluffs along the Missouri are high and steep, rising between 100 and 200 feet above the valley floors. From top downward, Figure 5. Missouri River bluff lands. they contain loess, drift, and bedrock. The mantle rock, dislodging and slipping from the upper parts of the slopes, leaves vertical walls above and forms slides below. The bluff line is further modified by numerous ravines, ridges, and truncated spurs. The topography, as a whole, is quite rough, interfering with the routing of transportation and with farming. Though less well defined at most places, the bluffs of the Platte, Loup, Elkhorn, and Republican valleys have about the same topographic features as those of the Missouri. There are certain differences, however, due to the fact that the loess is underlain by formations unlike those </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE along most of the Missouri river belt, and due also to the lower rainfall in the western parts. Bluff Land Soils— -The Knox silt loam and the rough phase of the Colby silt loam are the leading soils of the bluff lands. The Knox silt loam, which occurs in the eastern counties, resembles the Marshall silt loam in its lower subsoil, but has less humus in the upper layer because of the loss through erosion. The subsoil is mellow and can be plowed at any depth where exposed. The only defect of the soil, aside from tiie rough topography, is its low humus content. Occurring under 26 to 33 inches of rainfall, this type prows good stands of grasses and forest. Cleared land, though rough, is well adapted to alfalfa, grapes, and apples. Good returns are secured from commercial orcharding. There is successful fruit raising on the Knox silt loam and the Marshall silt loam near Blair, Omaha, Nebraska City, Peru, Brownville, and R,ulo. The general cultivation of the Knox silt loam to grain crops results, as a rule, in too much soil erosion, and therefore in the destruction of a valuable resource. The soil, being porous and mellow, absorbs heavy rainfalls, but this does not wholly overcome the effect of the rough topography which promotes run-off and the erosion of unprotected soil. At a few places, where cultivated to fruits, the Knox silt loam has been terraced with good results. The management of the Knox silt loam is not good as a whole. The natural forest which occupies much of the bluff land is formed of mixed trees such as the linden, oaks, elms, ash, and hickory for which, except the bur-oak for posts, there is no ready market. Alfalfa raising and fruit growing are successful and it would seem that persons owning the bluff land should engage upon the production of the profitable crops. Land Values of the Knox silt loam vary greatly, depending largely upon the location. The range is between about $90 an acre for the poorest locations and $300 or more in the vicinity of Omaha. The value of the Colby silt loam (rough phase) of the central and western parts of the Loess Region is from $15 upward. As has been shown, this soil is used mostly for grazing. ROUGH STONY LANDS These are represented by narrow belts and Irregular outcrops of sand rock, chalk rock, and shale in the Republican Valley; of sandstone in the lower courses of the Little Blue; sandstone and limestone in the lower part of the Big Blue; boulder areas, limestone and shale exposures in the central and lower parts of the Big Nemaha; limestone in the Weeping Water Valley and at places along the Missouri; sandstone and limestone along the lower course of the Platte; and limestone and sandstone in the Salt Creek Valley, as near Roca and Lincoln. </seg>
            <seg id="p237">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 237 Probably the best defined rough land in the Loess Region is the belts of chalk rock along the Republican between Bloomington and Riverton. The total area of the rough stony lands of the Loess Region Is not known. It is estimated at 250 square miles. This land varies much in value. Some is good for pasture, and a considerable amount is forested. Stone is quarried at places and some of the shale is used in brick - making.

WIND-FORMED HILL AREAS It is thought that the original loess plain extended a considerable distance west of its present boundary, and that this border has been modified by wind and streams, making it hilly, resembling the sandhills. The hilly areas, forming this fairly well-defined belt between the Loess and Sandhill regions, contain loess and other materials finer than those which occur in the sandhills, hence they are included in the Loess Region. Wind-formed hill areas also occur at places on the Loess Plains proper and along the edges of these plains, as northeast of Minden, and northwest of Grand Island. The total area of the wind-formed hilly lands in the Loess Region is about 900 square miles. The Soils of the wind-formed hill areas are more stable than dune - sand and lighter than the silt loams of the Loess Plains. They are usually classed with the Valentine and Colby series and have value in farming, but are better suited to grazing and the production of native hay. Land values range between $20 and about $100 an acre. LOESS HILL AREAS These occupy about 11,900 square miles of Nebraska, in the north - eastern part of the state, and a narrow belt west of the southern part of the bluff lands of the Missouri. Included within the boundaries of these areas are several small loess plains and valleys. The plains are the high, flat divides and the valley forms are principally flood plains, terraces, and small bluffs. The loess hills (Figure 6) were eroded from the loess plains. They are characterized by remarkably smooth surfaces mantled with loess. Though many of the hills in Custer, Sherman, Valley, and other counties on the west are quite steep, they usually have rounded slopes compara - tively free from gulleys and other erosional forms.

The underlying materials outcrop at widely separated places and are encountered in wells and some wagon and railroad cuts. There is no drift in the western parts of the loess hill areas. LOESS HILL SOILS There are several soils on the loess hills but the Marshall silt loam has the largest distribution and greatest agricultural importance. It has a dark brown to nearly black, mellow surface soil, 10 to 15 inches deep, underlain by a comparatively mellow subsoil which grades downward into undisturbed loess. A flat phase of the Marshall occupies some of the small loess plains farthest northeast. Similar plains farther west are occupied by Colby silt loam and Colby very fine sandy Xoavi which extend onto the hills but mostly as shallow phases. On the east, the Marshall grades on some of the steepest hillsides into the Knox silt loam. Figure 6. View of Loess Hills northwest of Neligh, showing fields of corn and alfalfa. The Marshall silt loam absorbs moisture quite readily and erodes much less by running water than would be expected in view of its occurrence on hills. This is not a reason, however, why farmers should not guard against the erosion of loess hill land. There are other soils of limited distribution in the loess hill areas, as those of the small flood plains and benches, and those formed on the sand and drift exposures of some hillsides. </seg>
            <seg id="p239">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 239 DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOESS HILL AREAS These areas have a good supply of well water at most places which is a factor of importance. Most soils are productive without the use of artificial fertilizers. This is particularly true of the leading type, Marshall silt loam. Though there is some erosion, reducing the Uumus content of the upland soils, this loss can be replenished by growing alfalfa and by the use of manures. The Marshall silt loam has great value in growing corn, oats, alfalfa, wheat, vegetables, trees, apples, and other crops. It is the state's second best corn soil and, because of its wide distribution under a favorable rainfall, the loess hill areas have become the state's ranking corn raising district and one of the leading stock raising areas. The loess hill country is well improved as to agriculture, roads, towns, and cities. Most land is cultivated with improved machinery drawn by horse power or motors. Farming is carried -on in a large way under a high capitaliza - tion. Land Values in the loess hill area, determined by soil, rainfall, topography, location and improvements, range from $80 an acre on the west to more than $500 in the east and northeast. Small farms well located have sold higher. References: The soil survey reports of Wayne, Thurston, Wash - ington, Dodge, Douglas, Cass, Nemaha, and Richardson counties.

THE DRIFT HILL AREA This, with an approximate extent of 6,700 square miles, occupies much of the upland of Saunders, Cass, Lancaster, Gage, Pawnee, Johnson, Otoe, Nemaha, and Richardson counties. Similar areas occur in north - eastern Kansas, northern Missouri, and southern Iowa. The drift hill areas represent a stage of physiographic development freyond that of the loess hills, in which all or nearly all of the loess mantle is removed and the surface features and soils are formed upon the drift sheets. The hills have a characteristic form, less even than the loess hills, and are further distinguished by the presence of sand, pebbles, and boulders in the subsoil and sometimes in the surface soil. DRIFT HILL SOILS These range between silt loam and loams. The main type is the Carrington silt loam which resembles the Marshall silt loam of the loeas hills, but contains less silt and more sand and clay. The soil Is dark brown to nearly black, quite high in humus, and productive. In it* </seg>
            <seg id="p240">240 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE best development, there are no pebbles and boulders In the surface soil but they may occur in the deeper subsoil. The Shelby loam, sometimes called the Carrington loam, occupies some of the knolls, hill crests, and steep hillsides where erosion has re - moved much of the surface soil and concentrated the coarser particles of the upper subsoil. It has less humus than the Carrington silt loam and contains some stony material. Figure 7. Wheat on the drift hills of Lancaster County. Sandy soils are formed on eroded valleysides of the drift hill area, especially where the Aftonian sands are exposed between the Kansan and Nebraskan drift sheets. Small boulder areas occur at places on the rough hills where all of the drift, except the coarse materials, has been removed. Such areas are in Nemaha, Richardson, and Lancaster counties. The complete removal of the drift on steep valley sides, as along the lower parts of the Big Blue and Little Blue, and along the Big Nemaha, has resulted in the formation of soils on the bedrock. One of the best examples of a bedrock soil is the Lancaster fine sandy loam developed on the Dakota sandstone in the vicinity of Lincoln. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DRIFT HILL AREA The development here has reached a high stage. There is sufficient rainfall for agriculture. The Carrington silt loam, which occupies most </seg>
            <seg id="p241">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 241 of the area, is very productive and nearly all successfully cultivated to corn, oats, wheat (Figure 7), alfalfa, vegetables, and fruits. The Shelby loam is not farmed so generally, partly because it is better suited for pasture and partly because it is not stone free. The rough lands support grazing and natural forest. The bottom lands, where cleared of forest, are grown to corn, wheat, and other crops, or pastured. The principal problems of the drift hill area are erosion and the correction of sour soils. Farmers who have the drift soils on their place, should guard against erosion, which if not checked, will change the valuable Carrington silt loam to a loam of much less value. Here is a conservation problem of great importance. There are, on some hillsides, small areas of sour or dead drift soils which could be corrected by the use of finely ground limestone. Fortu - nately, limestones are exposed in this part of the state and they can be quarried and crushed for use, or the fine dust and screenings from quarries operating at or near Louisville, Meadow, Nehawka, and Weeping Water can be bought at low cost for this purpose. Viewed as a whole, the drift hill country is an important agricultural district. It is the second leading corn growing district of the state, but diversifies along other lines, as in stock raising. The grain type of farming, together with the raising of hogs, cattle, and some poultry, sheep and horses, prevails. Machinery is extensively used and farming is a commercial proposition. The fertile soils, adequate rainfall, and good water supplies have caused this drift hill area to rank high in the development of agriculture, transportation, towns, cities, and social conditions. Land Values in the drift hill area range from $90 or $100 an acre for the roughest land to |475 for the improved Carrington silt loam well located with respect to markets. Small tracts near towns sell higher. References: The soil survey reports of Gage, Seward, Saunders, Cass, Otoe, Nemaha, and Richardson counties. BENCH LANDS These are prominent features of valleys in the Loess Region (Figure 8). Their origin is thought to have been about as follows: The original loess plain was deeply trenched by rivers; later, the streams nearly filled their valleys with sand below and silt at the higher levels, after which there came a time when the streams began to re-deepen their courses, which resulted in leaving the flat areas or benches on the valley - sides as we now find them. Some of the best defined terraces are at Blair, Omaha, Nemaha City, Ashland, Lincoln, St. Paul; north of Fremont, Schuyler, and Columbus; </seg>
            <seg id="p242">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 242 and at Superior, Oxford, McCook, and Culbertson. They occur in two or three steps or levels at some of these places, rising 20, 40, or even 60 feet or more above the bottom lands proper. The total area of bench land in the Loess Region of Nebraska is estimated at 2,150 square miles. TERRACE SOILS Most terraces are quite smooth and capped with a thick deposit of silt loam underlain with sand. The silt loam is loess-like, hence it is called terrace loess. The drainage of terraces is good as a rule, except where there are ■mall basins like those of the loess plains. These basins are occupied by the Scott silt loam. The prevailing soil on the benches in the eastern part of the Loess Region is the Waukesha silt loam which is dark brown, 12 to 15 inches deep, and high in organic matter. The subsoil is a yellowish, silty clay which, at 20 inches, becomes quite compact and buff colored. It is loess - like below 30 or 40 inches. The Waukesha soils range between fine sandy loam and silt loam. As a rule, the texture becomes a little lighter as one follows the benches of the main valleys westward or northwestward across the region, as along the Platte, Republican, Loup, and the Elkhorn. The knolls or slightly elevated areas on the terraces have lighter textured soils than the general distribution. There are places in the central courses of the main valleys of the Loess Region, as north of Scribner in the Elkhorn, and northwest of Thurston in Logan Valley, where the silt cap of the benches is thin and the soils are formed in part or nearly wholly from the underlying sand. This condition has given rise to soils classed as Sioux sand, Sioux loam, Thurston sand, and Thurston loam, all of which may be regarded as light types of the Waukesha series. These soils are less productive than the Waukesha silt loam of the eastern part of the region and the fine sandy loams, and very fine sandy loams in the lower and middle courses of the Republican Valley benches. Sand is exposed along the edges or scarps of most benches. This, when mixed with the finer materials from above, forms small local areas of light soils, or it is washed out upon the valley floors, making the fine sandy loams and other light soils. This condition is found at many places in the largest valleys. DEVELOPMENT OF BENCH LANDS The bench lands, because of their fertility, smooth surface, and posi - tion above flood level, have a high value, ranging between $100 and $500 </seg>

They are successfully cultivated to alfalfa, corn, small grains, vegetables, and some fruits, but are especially well suited to alfalfa. These lands afford good locations for roads, towns, and cities.

It was well chosen to represent the wide valley bottoms of the Loess Region. The notable example of a broad valley is that of the Platte which has a width of about 18 miles in parts of its middle course. The alluvial plains of the Loess Region are comparatively smooth. They have a total area of about 3,750 square miles, including flood plaint, alluvial fans, colluvial slopes and the poorly defined low benches (Figure 8). Flood Plains — The lowest valley bottoms are subject to flooding by their streams, hence they are called flood plains. Figure 8. A generalized cross-section of a Loess Region valley showing 1, Loess Plains; 2, Terraces; 3, Colluvial Slope; 4, Alluvial Fan; 5, Flood Plain. Alluvial Fans are formed at the mouths of steep tributary valleys bordering flood plains. The small, swift, intermittent streams of these valleys carry much sediment, but drop it upon reaching the flat land of the trunk valley. The sediment deposited in this way causes the water to spread out and to distribute the sediments in a fan-ahaped form. There </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are thousands of small alluvial fans in the Loess Region, and other parts of the state. They usually lie above the flood heights of trunk streams and are fairly -well drained. Colluvial Slopes occur along the edges of flood plains and extend onto the foot of valley sides. They are built mostly of fine materials slipping and washing down from the slopes. The colluvial forms are made smooth by the action of sheet water. They differ greatly in size and somewhat in the texture of their soils, but are best defined where there are few ravines and where for a long time the trunk stream has not eroded against the slope and removed the local deposits. Some colluvial slopes are terrace-like. ALLUVIAL SOILS Several alluvial soils of the Loess Region have been mapped and classed under the Wabash, Cats, Sarpy, Hall, Lamoure, Judson, and other series (Figure 9). The agricultural alluvial soils with largest distribution in the eastern counties are Wabash silt loam, Wabash silty clay loam, Wabash clay, and some of the medium textured types of the Cass, Sarpy, Hall, Lamoure, and Judson series. Viewed as a whole, the distribution of the alluvial soils is spotted or patchy when compared with the upland types which extend uniformly over wide areas. The large valley floors of Nebraska have many soils, occurring in irregular, small areas. There may be several kinds on a single small farm. This condition requires consideration in farm management because the soils vary greatly in texture, structure, drainage conditions, and agricultural possibilities. The Wabash Soils are fine textured, dark colored, and unusually deep in both soil and subsoil. They occupy most of the flood plains of the Big Nemaha, Little Nemaha, Weeping Water, Salt Creek, Maple Creek, Logan Creek, and the Big Blue and its tributaries, and considerable areas in the valleys of the Platte, Elkhorn, and Missouri. A great deal of the land, occupied by the Wabash soils, has been improved by straightening creek and river channels and by the construction of independent drainage ditches. Some land has been tiled, as near Fremont and Nickerson. The Wabash soils are naturally strong. Lying near the water level, they are not much affected by drouths. They are the state's strongest corn producing soils, but are also cropped to small grains. Where too wet, they are pastured or used in native hay production. As a rule, narrow belts of forest follow the streams located on these soils. The Wabash soils range in value per acre from about $100 to $500 or more. As a rule, farms, except on the large valleys, are occupied in part by other soils. </seg>

            <seg id="p246">246 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE river valleys. They are intermediate in character between the Wabash and Sarpy soils. The surface soil is dark brown to black. The upper subsoil is a little lighter in texture, commonly pale yellow or grayish in color and grades downward into sand. The soils are subject to overflows, but all of them, except the heavier types, drain well at low stages of their streams. The survey has studied and mapped seven types of the Cass soils In Nebraska. They are the fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, and clay. The Cass fine sand, as mapped in Hall County, supports grass and tree growth, but little of it is culti - vated. The fine sandy loam, where it lies close to the water level, as in western Douglas County, makes good wild hay land. The other types except the clay and the clay loam, are successfully farmed to corn rotated with small grains and other crops. When drained, the clay loam is adapted to cultivation, but the clay, which occupies depressions and abandoned channels along the Missouri, grows only willows at most points. The Sarpy Soils range from light gray to brown in the color of their surface layer, but grade quickly in the subsoil to light colored sand. Though the soils are subject to flooding, their structure is favorable to good drainage. The Sarpy soils are lighter in color, and have the sandy subsoil nearer the surface than the soils of the Cass series. The fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, and clay of the Sarpy series have been studied and mapped in Nebraska. They occur principally along the lower Platte and the Missouri River Valley. The fine sand is used mostly for pasture. It is too drouthy at most places for successful farming. The other types, except part of the fine sandy loam and most of the clay, are cultivated to corn, wheat, oats, and truck crops. The Hall Series of Soils, with typical distribution in Hall County, includes dark-colored types stiffer in the subsoil than in the surface layer. The color of the surface soil ranges from brown to nearly black and the subsoil is yellowish. This series is developed on low, alluvial terraces. The fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, and clay have been mapped and described in Hall County where they are the prevailing soils. Except the clay, all the types are cultivated to corn, wheat, alfalfa, and other crops. Hie Lamoure Soils are represented in the Loess Region by four types mapped along the Platte, as in Dodge, Polk, Hall, and Phelps counties. The Lamoure series is similar to the Cass in color, but differs in that the subsoil is as heavy or heavier than the surface soil. The material may be calcareous throughout the three-foot section, and always effervesces in the lower subsoil. The soils carry some alkali. Four types of the </seg>
            <seg id="p247">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 247 Lumoure soils have been mapped on the smooth, low-lying bottom lands of the Platte Valley. They are the fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay. The fine textured soils are poorly . drained. The Lamoure soils resemble those of the Wabnsh series but are less perfectly drained, have a lighter colored calcareous subsoil and may carry some alkali. If improved by drainage, the Lamoure soils have a high agricul - tural value. The Judson Soils, represented by the fine sandy loam and the silt loam, form long narrow belts on the low colluvial slopes bordering the flood plains of the Platte, Republican, and parts of the Missouri. In some places, these soils are on alluvial fans and terrace-like colluvial slopes. The soil materials were derived principally from the loess of the uplands, but they may receive coarser materials from drift, sand, etc., making the lighter types. The Judson soils are dark brown in the upper layer and light brown in the subsoil. They lie above flood levels, are quite well drained, and cultivated to the leading farm crops. Other Alluvial Soils have been mapped in the Loess Region. At places on the Platte Valley, as in Merrick and Hall counties, a thin surface soil is underlain by gravel. This condition, if the surface layer is not close to the water level, makes a drouthy condition which has given expression to the name "poverty ridge". The narrow sandy ridges on the Platte are also quite drouthy. Small patches of the sandy portions of the flood plains of the Elkhorn, Loup, Platte, and Republican have been modified by wind into dunesand. Some of the land bordering the Platte and Republican is only sandbars, or in a slightly more stable condition, called meadow land. The alluvial soils of the middle and upper courses of the Elkhorn and Loup valleys have not been studied in detail, yet they are known to be largely sandy and fine sandy loams. The first bottom soils of most of the Republican Valley, and along the Platte and South Platte of the western part of the Loess Region are quite sandy, ranging from loamy sand to very fine sandy loam, and they are bordered by many small areas of colluvial and alluvial fans having light textured soils.

The Missouri has destroyed 200 acres of valuable lands at a single point within a year, as on Brookey Bottom of Cedar County; at Decatur, Burt County; and above Peru, Nemaha </seg>
            <seg id="p248">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 248 County (Figure 10). The river removes the land at cut-banks and deposits the debris at other places as accretion land, which requires several years to become valuable. The Missouri damages Nebraska hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and the government has spent a large amount of money to check its ravages without much effect. A company recently organized at Lin - coln is making good progress in holding the river and preventing the destruction of valuable farm lands, and it seems that a movement should be organized and backed by the state and nation to solve the problem of the Missouri. Figure 10. Showing how the Missouri River destroyed a 240-acre farm in Nemaha County. The Platte River is shallow and wide, flowing through interlacing channels spread among numerous sandbars and islands, which means that it occupies too many square miles of the state. Our investigations cause us to believe that this river can be controlled at comparatively low cost, and confined to a single, narrow channel. This, if done, would add many square miles to the land area of Nebraska. Some of the rail - road and county bridges have been shortened to confine the river to one - half or less its original width and with good results 'n controlling the stream and reclaiming land, but there are persons who oppose this means of reclamation more on theory than on a basis of facts and results. </seg>
            <seg id="p249">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 249 THE SANDHILL REGION The sandhills of Nebraska embrace a large region in the northwest - central part of the state and smaller outlying areas ; some of which extend into Colorado, Wyoming, and South Dakota. The main division, or the Sandhill Region proper, is well defined. Its topography, drainage, soils, roads, and development are unlike those cf the Loess Region to the east and the High Plains Region to the west. The altitude rises from about 1,700 feet at the eastern border of the region to a little over 4,000 feet at the western border. The rainfall decreases from 28 inches on the east to about 18 inches on the west. The region is a vast prairie, and one of the most important cattle raising districts in the United States. Figure 11. A sketch map of the sandhill land forms in the vicinity of Antioch, Sheridan County. Extent of Sandhill Areas — Figure 1 shows the distribution of these areas. The Sandhill Region has an extent of a little more than 18,000 square miles. The extents of the main outliers are about as follows: Those on Box Butte Table in Scotts Bluff and Sioux counties, 174 square miles; on Springview Table of Cherry, Keyapaha and Boyd counties, 224 square miles; on Ainsworth Table and Holt Plain of Brown, Rock, </seg>
            <seg id="p250">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 250 and Holt counties, 160 square miles; the Lincoln County area, 522 square miles; the Dundy County area, 684 square miles; scattered hills on Perkins Plain, 320 square miles; small patches in the Platte Valley, about 224 Bquare miles. Much of the above hilly land is not occupied by dune - sand. It has soils of finer texture, such as belong to the Valentine, Rich - field, and other series. The total area of the Sandhill Region and its outliers is thought to be a little more than 20,000 square miles, of which 70 per cent or more is typical sandhill, i. e., hills. Figure 12. A wet valley and a lake of the sandhills Land Forms — A good many people think that all the hilly lands of western and northwestern Nebraska are sandhills. They are in error in this because the sandhills were shaped or built up by wind, and the rock hills, which occur along some of the valleys, were eroded out of sandy formations. The main land forms in the sandhill country are sandhills, basins, and valleys (Figure 11). Small alluvial valleys extend into the borders of the region. The hills, which gavethe name to the region, vary con - siderably in size and form. Their heights range from a few feet to 150 feet or more. A single small hill may occupy a few acres and a large one may extend over a section or more of land. Some of the hills, and particularly the high, rugged ones, are roughened on their west slopes by depressions or pits, called "blow outs." The hills usually are united into ridges, or ranges, between which occur the basins and valleys . Basins </seg>
            <seg id="p251">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 251 are circular to irregular depressions between the hills or between the poorly defined ridges. In parts of the region, as in the vicinity of Spade post office, about 20 miles northeast of Ainsworth, the hills and valleys extend in an east-west direction. They have lengths of from 6 to 12 miles and occupy about equal portions of the land, each having widths varying from one-half mile to one mile. Sandhill valleys are entirely surrounded by ridges, or they join in an extension of several miles. In places, they lie northwest-southeast or even in north-south directions. The valleys are classed as dry and wet. The wet valleys have a large number of lakes, some of which are surrounded in whole or in part by marshes (Figure 12). SOIL RESOURCES The soil resources of the sandhills are more valuable than is generally supposed. The leading divisions are dunesand, dry valley soils, and wet valley soils. Grass and native hay, the main products of these soils, sup - port extensive cattle raising. Dunesand is the typical soil on the hills (Figure 13). It is charac - terized by its uniform fine sandy texture, low humus' content, and mobility. There is not much difference between surface soil and subsoil, both being light gray in color and of loose structure. Most of the dunesand is protected by a grass cover but there are small patches of bare ground on the exposed slopes of hills. According to the state survey, the dunesand land is classed as first-grade and second-grade grazing land, depending upon the continuity of the grass cover. The second grade land has blow-ground, some '"blowouts" and, therefore, less grass. The duntsand grows a large number of valuable grasses and some useful herbaceous plants. The grasses afford good pasturage through a long season and some of them cure for use on winter range. In cattle raising, it requires from 8 to 12 acres of this land per animal during the season, and it is estimated that, under good management, the dunesand soil of the sandhills would pasture close to 1,000,000 cattle. The dunesand land ranges from $7 or $8 to about $20 an acre. It is not sold separately, however, but is included with valley lands in ranch sales which are made at from $17 to $30 or more an acre. Dry Valley Soils — These occur on valleys which lie a few feet above the water level and are well drained. They are smooth to slightly hilly. The surface soil is coherent enough to resist wind erosion but becomes less stable under cultivation. There are a few small tracts of com - paratively hard land in the dry valleys of the Sandhill Region, but most of the soils are classed with the Valentine series, and under four leading types which are sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, and very fine sandy </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE loam. The very fine sandy loam and the fine sandy loam are farmed successfully at a good many places. The lighter soils, that is, the sand and loamy sand, blow badly when plowed. They are on the border line between the grazing soils and the agricultural soils and should be used more for grazing and hay production than for farming. Figure 13. A sandhill view showing hills. A noticeable feature at places in the sandhills is the presence of large cottonwood groves in the dry valleys and on parts of wet valleys. This is particularly noticeable southwest of the town of Wood Lake and to the northwest of Brewster. Most of the dry valley areas are used for pasture and for the production of native hay. It requires from 2% to about 5 acres to pasture an animal, and the hay production is from one-half to one ton per acre. The principal cultivated crops grown on dry valleys are rye, corn, and potatoes. The dry valley lands range in value from $20 to $50 or more an acre, but are not sold separately, as a rule, because they are included in ranches which occupy principally the hill land. Wet Valley Soils — These are on the poorly drained valleys. The largest areas are in Cherry County, northeastern Morrill, northern </seg>
            <seg id="p253">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 253 Garden, southern Sheridan, and northeastern Rock County. Two soils, the fine sandy loam and the loamy fine sand, have been mapped on the wet valleys and classed with the Gannett series. They are composed principally of the finer grades of sand, but contain small amounts of clay, silt, and humus. In some locations, as in northeastern Morrill County, northwestern Garden County, and southern Sheridan County, the poorly drained soils carry large amounts of alkali, principally in the forms of potassium and sodium salts. The alkali soils grow principally salt grass which has some value in grazing. The wet valley lands grade into marsh areas, which usually occur on the seepage sides of lakes (Figure 12). There are places where nearly all of a valley is occupied by marsh land growing flags, bulrushs, wild rice, sedges, and the lower forms of vegetation. When drained, or when the lakes subside sufficiently, the wet meadow soils are used for hay production. Many lakes and marshes area of hay land. The wet valleys, acres or more to pasture an animal, hay per acre. have been drained to increase the known as hay lands, require two or they will cut about one ton of The Values of wet valley land an acre but the sales are made with going at a certain amount per acre. range from $30 to $60 or more other lands of a ranch, the whole DEVELOPMENT OF SANDHILL SOILS There are several conservation problems in the sandhills. Most of the grazing grasses are nutritious and valuable, but some of the dominant kinds are undesirable. For example, bunch grass, which occupies much of the surface of some hills, affords poor grazing, and the ranchmen have made an attempt to supplant it with more desirable kinds, such as blue stem, grama, and buffalo grass. Improvement has been made on a number of ranches and with good results in which the efficiency of the range has been doubled at places within a few years This shows that the matter of improving the grass resources of the region is one of great importance. The problem has been studied by Professor R. J. Pool of the Botany Department at The University of Nebraska. The hills must be properly managed if the soil is to be retained in a comparatively stable condition and not caused to be eroded by wind. Careless grazing, the plowing of hill land, and failure to take the neces - sary steps to check erosion when started, result in the destruction of soil and grasses and thereby in the loss of valuable resources. The problem of erosion is being studied by the State Survey. It has been proven that pines and other trees can be grown on sand - hills. The government has succeeded at Halsey in the f orestation of sev - eral hundred acres of the hills to pines, yet it does not seem best to </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE advocate the general forestation of the sandhills because of the great expense connected therewith and because the hills are especially well suited for grazing purposes. The dry valleys and wet valleys produce large quantities of hay for use in cattle raising (Figure 14). These valleys yield about one ton of hay per acre a year and it is thought that the breaking of the land for cropping to corn, wheat, etc., as has been done at many places, would, if carried on more generally, bring much smaller returns than are now realized from the hay, with less work. Furthermore, hay, next to grass, is needed in cattle raising which is destined to continue as the leading industry of the Sandhill Region unless it becomes necessary, because of some reason which we do not now see, to change the utilization and manage - ment of the soils of the Sandhill Region or of parts of it. Figure 14. Cutting wild hay in the sandhills of Cherry County. It is not easy to determine whether certain lakes and marshes of the sandhills should be drained in order to add to the grazing land and hay land. This is because some lakes have importance in fishing and hunting. The marshes are the haunts of muskrats and other fur-bearing animals which are trapped with good returns. Each case of proposed drainage should be decided mainly on a basis of what may be the best use of the land, i. e., whether in its natural condition or as it would be after being drained. </seg>
            <seg id="p255">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 255 CATTLE RAISING The sandhills constitute Nebraska's great cattle raising district (Figure 15). The favorable factors here are the healthful climate, abundant water supply, and grass resources for pasturage and hay production. Grass and hay are produced in abundarre every year, whether there is a wet season or a dry season. When grazing fails in Wyoming, Colorado, and other hard land states, because of drouth, cattle are shipped to the Nebraska sandhills and pastured, or the dry districts import sandhill hay for feed. Figure 15. Cattle in the sandhills. The sandhill cattle have been improved by the use of registered bulls and a good many registered cows. The principal breeds are Herefords, Shorthorns, and Angus. It is not an uncommon sight to see a thousand or more well-bred animals on a single ranch. These animals are grown to two, three, and sometimes four-year-olds and shipped to the feed-lots or to market. The sandhills, in raising a large number of cattle ready to be finished for market, supplement the corn and alfalfa areas of the state in beef production. Many animals raised in the hills are shipped to the feed-lots of the Loess Region and finished for market, or they are sent to the irrigation districts and finished on beet pulp, alfalfa and other feeds and marketed in Omaha and other places. </seg>
            <seg id="p256">256 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SANDHILL RANCHES The cattle raising activities of the sandhills are carried on in a large way under a heavy capitalization. The Kinkaiders, who filed on land a few years ago, have sold their holdings to ranchmen or they have engaged in the ranch business. Very little farming is done now except to raise vegetables, some fruit, and to grow a small amount of grain. Much of the pasture and hay land of the sandhills has been improved by the introduction of new grasses and by better care of meadows. This management of ranches has added to the soil resources, and it should be more generally known and understood that to plow these lands would not improve them, but that in many places it would destroy the soil. There is considerable difference in the sizes of ranches. Some are small and not much improved, but the tendency for a few years has been to increase the holdings, i. e., to centralize. So the ranches now vary from 640 and 1,000 acres to many thousands of acres. The largest ones cover 50,000 acres or more. Ranches are all fenced and in most cases cross-fenced to make sum - mer pastures and to separate the holdings into summer and winter ranges. Water supplies are provided in practically all pastures by means of wells and windmills. This facilitates the movement of cattle in grazing and shows the importance of a dependable water supply available at all points. Poultry is raised on most of the ranches. Hogs are found where some corn is grown and horses are used in fence-riding, roundups, trail - ing, shaping-up, and haying. The telephone is in general use. Most roads follow valleys and many of them are in bad condition. The auto has nearly supplanted the buggy and wagon for travel and the truck is rapidly taking the place of the wagon in the haulage of ranch supplies. A considerable amount of labor is required on the ranches to do fencing, manage the range, put up hay, and for the winter feeding. Many of the small ranches are poorly equipped but most of the larger ones have well built corrals, lots, dipping vats, branding pens, dehorning pens, barns, and residences located on dry valleys and surrounded more or less by cottonwood groves. </seg>
            <seg id="p257">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 257 THE HIGH PLAINS REGION This, the most diverse province of Nebraska, occupies between 15,000 and 16,000 square miles of the western and northern parts of the state. It is called the High Plains Region because of its table lands or plains which are thought to be the remnants of a very large plain which formerly extended across central and western Nebraska and parts of the adjacent states. The original high plain sloped eastward from the Rocky Mountains, was comparatively smooth (Figure 16), and formed of thick layers of sand, silt, and other materials of Tertiary age, and shale, chalkrock, sandstone, etc., of Cretaceous and older ages. Figure 16. A table land view. The Platte, Niobrara, White River, and other streams have modified the original high plain surface. They eroded deeply the Tertiary beds in a considerable part of the region, and, in some places, cut entirely through them and into the Cretaceous formations. This dissection separated the plain into a number of distinct divisions, made the valleys and rough lands, and exposed seven geological formations upon which a number of soils were developed. So the region is now composed of several parts, each having more or less geographic and economic unity. The largest divisions of the High Plains Region of Nebraska, as shown by Figure 1, are Perkins Plain, Cheyenne Table, Pumpkin Creek Valley, Wildcat Ridge, North Platte Valley, Box Butte Table, Niobrara Valley (western part), Dawes Table, Pine Ridge, Hat Creek Basin, White River Basin, Springview Table, Ainsworth Table, and Holt Plain. Several 9 </seg>

Small, scattered patches of sand - hills are found in several divisions of the High Plains Region. Following are brief descriptions of the topography, soils, and develop - ment of the sub-divisions of the High Plains Region. PERKINS PLAIN This division has an area of about 1,650 square miles in Chase, Perkins, and southern Keith County of Nebraska and extends into north - eastern Colorado. It is bordered on the north by South Platte Valley, on the east by sandhill and loess areas, and on the south by the Dundy County sandhills. The surface of Perkins Plain varies from nearly level to undulating, rolling, and rough. It is largely an upland plain, but has areas of sand - hills, valley slopes, rough lands, and inextensive benches and flood plains. The altitude increases from 3,150 feet on the east to 3,550 feet on the west. The annual rainfall is between 17% and 20 inches and the growing season, from 136 to 143 days. PERKINS PLAIN SOILS These are residual, aeolian and alluvial in origin. Those with largest distribution occur on the upland and were formed on the Ogallala Forma - tion which is composed mainly of sand, silt, and sandstone carrying some coarse material and impregnated more or less with calcium car - bonate. There is wide range in the texture and structure of the soils, from dunesand and loamy sands to loams and silt loams. The highest upland is occupied principally by the heavier soils in association with small bodies of dunesand and light types of the Valentine series. The slopes and most of the rough lands have the lighter soils, and some rough stony land. The bench lands and flood plains are occupied by stable soils, such as sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, and loams. The soil series with largest extent in the Perkins Plain area are the Rosebud. Dawes, Valentine, Tripp, and Laurel. The Rosebud Soils have a brown to dark brown, moderately calcareous surface soil and a highly calcareous, whitish, floury subsoil, which may contain some gravel. A light colored, sandy, calcareous bedrock may lie at a shallow depth under some of the soil types or be exposed in the ravines and slopes. The heavier Rosebud soils occur principally on the gently undulating uplands, but the lighter ones extend onto the valley ■ides. </seg>
            <seg id="p259">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 259 Four types of the Rosebud aeries occur on Perkins Plain. They are the tandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, and silt loam. The sandy loam occurs as a number of scattered areas in central Perkins County and as long narrow belts in north-central Chase County. The fine sandy loam is associated with these areas. The types with largest distribution and greatest agricultural value are the loam and silt loam which occupy part of southeastern Keith, much of northern and eastern Perkins and most of northwestern Chase and southwestern Perkins. All types of the Rosebud series are farmed to such crops as wheat, corn, oats, kaflr, and cane with favorable yields, especially during the years of normal rainfall. The Dawea Soils have a brownish to dark brown surface soil and a brownish to black upper subsoil with moderately friable and compact structure which grades at 20 to 30 inches to a light gray, highly cal - careous silty clay. The upper subsoil is heavier than the surface soil which does not contain much calcareous material. The Dawes soils occur principally in basin-like areas and valley - like depressions in the highest parts of the upland. Their origin is complicated, the types having been weathered from the bedrock and modi - fied more or less by colluvial and wind action. The Rosebud and Dawes soils differ mainly in the upper and lower parts of the subsoil. The Dawes soils of Perkins Plain closely resemble the Dunlap types on parts of Box Butte Table and Cheyenne Table. Three types of the Dawes soils have been studied and mapped on Perkins Plain. They are the sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and loam, all of which are successfully farmed to wheat, corn, and other crops. The loam occupies much of the surface in the vicinity of Imperial, a number of the slightly depressed areas near Lamar, and extends as patches across southwestern and western Perkins County. The fine sandy loam occurs in the same general areas but in smaller bodies, and the sandy loam is adjacent to the lighter soils of the Valentine series, which are associated with the small bodies of sandhills. The Valentine Soil Series is represented on Perkins Plain (near its sandhill areas) by four types, the loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam and fine sandy loam. These are lighter than the Rosebud and Daves soils. They show less difference between soil and subsoil and have a tendency to blow when plowed. This is particularly true of the loamy sand and loamy fine sand, which are better suited to grazing and the production of native hay than farming. The finer textured types are used for pasture, the production of native hay, and farming to corn, rye, oats, potatoes, etc. The Tripp and Laurel Series of soils occupy the alluvial bench lands and narrow flood plains of valleys. They are grazed, used for th» </seg>
            <seg id="p260">260 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE production of native hay, or farmed to such crops as corn and the small grains. Some of the bench land is successfully irrigated from canals and parts of the flood plains are sub-irrigated. DEVELOPMENT OF PERKINS PLAIN Prior to 1880, this area was an open range. Between 1880 and 1890, much of the land was filed upon and farming began with seeds and methods better suited to Illinois, Iowa, and eastern Nebraska than to Perkins Plain. The results were unsure. Then came the drouths of 1893 and 1894, following which many people left the country, and the land gradually fell into large holdings used mostly for cattle and horse raising. Of late years, forms of agriculture better suited and better adapted to the climate, and to the soil conditions have crowded the range until we now have a system of stock raising in connection with grain-farming, and on holdings ranging from 160 acres to 2,000 acres or more. The heavy soils of the "hard lands" are largely cultivated to small grains, forage crops, and corn, and the more sandy agricultural soils are grown to such crops as corn, rye, and potatoes. The sandhills and rough lands are used for grazing. It is generally recognized that the amount of rainfall and the need for the conservation of soil moisture are factors of importance in the agricultural development of Perkins Plain. Farmers are adapting their crops and methods to the conditions which confront them. The heavy soils are stirred frequently in order to maintain a mulch, but the lighter types are plowed less deeply and less frequently. The main crops on Perkins Plain are corn, wheat, barley, sorghum, rye, emmer, and millet. Some alfalfa, potatoes, vegetables, and fruits are grown. Cherries and plums seem to be the surest fruits. Stock rais - ing includes cattle, hogs, horses, poultry, and sheep. Much of the country is quite well improved as to roads, fencing, telephone, and houses. Autos, tractors, and trucks are used quite gen - erally. The main towns on railroads are Imperial and Grant. Land Values of Perkins Plain have shown a marked advance the past two years, and they now range from $15 for grazing land to more than $100 an acre for farm land. </seg>
            <seg id="p261">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 261 CHEYENNE TABLE This division of the High Plains Region is in the southern part of the panhandle of Nebraska, extending southward from the Pumpkin Creek and North Platte valleys to and beyond the Colorado line and westward into Wyoming. The eastern border, which joins the small loess plain of Keith County, is not well defined, and it seems that on a basis of topography, the latter might be included with this area. Cheyenne Table comprises the whole of Kimball and Cheyenne, most of Deuel, the southern parts of Banner and Morrill, and the southwestern part of Garden County. The extent of this division in Nebraska is about 3,275 square miles. The surface of Cheyenne Table varies from nearly level to undulating and hilly and is further modified by the Lodgepole, Lawrence Fork, Rush Creek, and Ash Creek valleys, and by many small valleys, most of which are deep canyons. The Lodgepole Valley divides Kimball and Cheyenne counties into north and south tables. It is U-shaped, from one to two miles wide, about 300 feet deep, and bordered by gradual slopes which rise to steep, upper slopes. The Lawrence Fork, Rush Creek, and Ash Creek valleys in the north part of the area, and tributaries of Pumpkin Creek and North Platte, are bordered intermittently by rough land. The altitude of the upland of the Cheyenne Table area rises from 2,700 feet at the eastern side to 5,340 feet at the west boundary of Banner County, which is the highest point in Nebraska. The rainfall is 19 inches on the east and 16.5 inches on the Wyoming line. The average growing season is about 132 days. CHEYENNE TABLE SOILS The soil conditions of this area are, as a whole, quite complicated. Much of the upland is occupied by residual soils derived from the Ogallala Formation which consists of clay, silt, sand, gravel, and beds of soft sandstone cemented with varying quantities of calcium carbonate which give it a light color. The stone containing much calcareous material is called "magnesia rock." The upland has been eroded and reduced at places, resulting in the exposure and weathering of bedrock materials. This has given rise to several soils, ranging from silt loam to gravelly sandy loam, and has left rough stony land on some valleysides. The principal streams of the area have made valleys in the original table land, exposing layers of the Ogallala Formation and part of the underlying Brule clay. Later, these valleys were partly filled with alluvial materials. Subsequent erosion and deposition formed the ter- </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE races and flood plains which are occupied principally by sandy to silt loam soils of the Tripp and Laurel series. The land rising from the valley floors to the tables proper are formed of alluvial fans, colluvial slopes, and residual slopes, all of which are occupied by light textured soils, such as gravelly sandy loam and fine sandy loam. Most soils of the area have a brownish surface layer and a light gray subsoil which is very calcareous. The leading soil series are the Rosebud (formerly called Sidney), Cheyenne, Tripp, Laurel, Dunlap, and Scott. They are briefly discussed under the divisions: table lands, slope lands, rough lands, terraces, and alluvial plains. Table Land Soils The soil conditions on the broad table lands are quite uniform. In fact, a single type with its variations occupies much of the eastern part of the area. This is the Rosebud silt loam, which has a brown to dark brown silt loam surface soil underlain by a slightly heavier layer which passes into a light colored calcareous subsoil. This type occurs as large bodies in Deuel and Cheyenne counties and as scattered smaller bodies in southwestern Garden, southwestern Morrill, southern Banner, and various parts of Kimball County. The Rosebud silt loam is successfully cultivated to wheat, corn, oats, and other crops. A gravelly phase of the type, with small extent in Cheyenne, Morrill, and Kimball counties, is somewhat drouthy and there - fore not so valuable for cultivation. The shallow phase of the type, being thinner in the upper layer because of erosion, occurs on some of the undulating to hilly parts of the tables and ranks only fairly well in cropping value. It usually is underlain near the surface by the light colored magnesia rock. Another variation of the Rosebud silt loam is called the deep phase. Its surface soil is dark and deeper than the usual run of the type. The largest distribution of this phase is in the northern and southern parts of Cheyenne County. This is the soil which gave impetus to farming on the well-known Dalton Table of Cheyenne County. The Rosebud loam occupies small areas in association with the tilt loam, especially in Kimball, Banner, Morrill, and Cheyenne coun - ties. It is one of the best agricultural types of the area. The Rose - bud very fine sandy loam and the fine sandy loam occur on most of the table lands, bordering the silt loam and loam, forming a transi - tion zone between the uplands proper and the slope lands. The Rosebud gravelly sandy loam occurs on the high tables as small patches and ridge-like bodies. It was derived from gravel layers in the Ogallala Formation and is too drouthy for farming. </seg>
            <seg id="p263">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 263 The Dunlap silt loam is found in some of the slightly depressed areas on the highest table lands, principally of Cheyenne County. The surface soil is dark brown, 8 to 12 inches deep, and underlain by a dark brown heavy silt loam which passes through a light gray to brownish heavy silt loam into a light colored calcareous silt loam. The type is distinguished from the Rosebud by its heavy, compact sub - soil. The agricultural value of the Dunlap silt loam is about the same as the Rosebud silt loam but it requires more careful handling. Two of the typical distributions of the Dunlap silt loam on Chey - enne Table are two miles southwest of Dalton and ten miles east of Lorenzo, both In Cheyenne County. The type occurs as inextensive areas in western Deuel and southwestern Morrill County. The very small basin-like depressions, called "buffalo wallows," and occurring at many places in the various counties, are lined with a comparatively heavy soil called the Scott silt loam. The largest body of this soil is about 13 miles south and 5 miles west of Kimball. The foregoing descriptions show that much of the eastern and central parts of the nearly level to undulating table of Deuel and Cheyenne counties is occupied by the Rosebud silt loam, and that the soils become a little lighter towards the valley sides, and westward to the Wyoming line. There are scattered areas of the silt loam in Morrill and Banner counties, but the loam, very fine sandy loam, and sandy loam predominate here as they do in Kimball County. Slope Land Soils The principal valley floors of the Cheyenne Table area are bordered by well defined slope lands. Parts of the sides of some valleys are narrow and bare or only thinly covered with rock debris and soil. The lower slopes of the South Platte, Lodgepole and its tributaries are long, rounded, and formed of alluvial fans and colluvial slopes. Higher on these valleysldes the soils are principally of residual origin and classed with the Rosebud series. Much of the slope land of the area is occupied by the Rosebud gravelly sandy loam. The largest extent of this soil is In Lodgepole Valley forming a belt between the terraces and edges of the table lands. A belt of this soil occupies the slopes north of the creek throughout the length of the valley, and extends beyond along the South Platte most of the way to Sutherland. The width of this belt ranges from one-quarter mile to two miles or more. The widest places are north of Chappell, in the western part of Cheyenne County, and in Kimball County between Kimball and the Wyoming line. The type forms a belt on the south side of Lodgepole Valley from the Wyoming line to Kimball, occurs in various tributary valleys of the Lodgepole, and along the south edge of Sidney Draw southwest of the city of Sidney. </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The slope lands at the heads of some of the South Platte tribu taries, across the divide southeast of Sidney, are occupied by the Rosebud gravelly sandy loam. There is a large area of this type on both sides of the lower course of Rush Creek and small patches are scattered in the smaller valleys of the high escarpment of Banner and Morrill counties. The upper parts of most valley slopes of Cheyenne Table are occupied by the Rosebud sandy loam and very fine sandy loam which grade into the heavier types on the edges of the table land proper. In some parts of Kimball County, the sandy loams and fine sandy loams extend down to the edges of the terraces, but elsewhere and throughout most of the area, the terraces and flood plains are bord - ered by the gravelly sandy loam. A great deal of the slope land of the Cheyenne Table area is better suited for grazing than for farming. There are places, how ever, where the lower colluvial slopes contain soils heavy enough for successful dry farming. Rough Lands Cheyenne Table has several areas of rough land. They are the steep valleysides in which more or less stone is exposed, and ledges of rock and rock exposures alternate with small patches of debris in process of soil formation. The land of this kind has little value. It supports some tree growth, such as the yellow pine and cedar, and is largely used for grazing. There are about 265 square miles of rough land in the Cheyenne Table area, much of it being the rough stony type, located as fol - lows: Along Lawrence Fork, Rush Creek and east or Ash Creek; the rough land escarpment of the North Platte; south of the Lodge pole at a point southeast of where the creek crosses the Wyoming line; two miles west of Kimball; northeast of Dix; northwest of Sidney; southwest of Sidney, and east of Potter. Terrace Soils Terraces are well developed in Lodgepole Valley and Sidney Draw, and occur in parts of Lawrence Fork, and South Platte. They stand 10 to 40 feet or more above first bottoms and a higher terrace is found at a few places in Lodgepole Valley. The benches in the western part of the Lodgepole, between Kim ball and the state line, are occupied by the Cheyenne fine sandy loam and the very fine sandy loam. The first named of these supports a good growth of grasses and is used mostly for grazing, whereas the other Is quite well suited for farming under irrigation. </seg>
            <seg id="p265">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 265 The principal bench land soils of the area are classed with the Tripp tenet. They have a light brown to grayish surface soil and a light gray to pale yellow subsoil which is highly calcareous. A large body of this soil, the very fine sandy loam, extends on the south side of the Lodgepole from Kimball to and beyond the Chey - enne County line. It is quite smooth, drains well and is nearly all irrigated. Similar, though smaller bodies of this soil, occurring in Cheyenne and Deuel counties, are mostly irrigated. The low and high benches of Cheyenne County are capped with the Tripp very fine sandy loam and the silt loam. Some of their edges, bordering the flood plains, have lighter soils. A large body of the Tripp silt loam and very fine sandy loam, occurs along Sidney Draw, southwest of the city of Sidney. Most of this is farmed. At least 90% of the heavier textured terrace soils of Cheyenne County are in cultivation, partly under irrigation and partly by dry farming. Bench lands occupied by Tripp soils border both sides of the Lodgepole across much of Deuel County and are dry farmed, or irri - gated to corn, alfalfa, and other crops. Alluvial Soils Lodgepole Creek and its tributaries have narrow strips of first bottom land, occupied by Laurel and Cheyenne soils. There is not much difference between the soils of these series except that the Laurel types are a little more stable and, in some cases, they show more difference between the surface soil and subsoil. Both series have a large content of sand. The Laurel very fine sandy loam borders Lodgepole Creek through cut most of its length in Nebraska. It grades locally into lighter soils. The Laurel soils support a good growth of grasses which are used for pasture and wild hay. In the western parts of Kimball County, both in the trunk valley of the Lodgepole and its tributaries, most of the flood plains are occupied by soils which range from the gravelly sandy loam to the very fine sandy loam. These support thin stands of grasses and are used for gracing. Similar conditions occur in most of the length of Lawrence Fork, Rush Creek, and Ash Creek. The bottoms of the small valleys and canyons of Cheyenne Table are strewn with sand and gravel wash which is not developed to a stage called soil. The name "sand draw" is used for these valley forms and their sandy beds. 9a </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHEYENNE TABLE Climate and soils are the controlling factors in the agricultural de - velopment of this region. The low rainfall limits the yields of most crops, and the short growing season makes it necessary to raise quicker maturing crops than in eastern Nebraska. The soils vary much in texture, structure, and topographic position and therefore in their agricultural relations. Some types are drouthy, others conserve the rainfall and soil moisture and are well adapted to farming. Fortunately, much of the area is occupied by soils well suited to sub-humid farming. The development of the Cheyenne Table area started with cattle raising on open range; shifted to unsuccessful farming with crops and methods unsulted to the climate and soils; and went back to grazing which gradually gave way to a system of farming adapted to the conditions which shape the development. The rough lands and the drouthy soils now support grazing. Wild hay is grown on some of the upland and on the lowest parts of the flood plains of the Lodgepole and South Platte. The heavier soils on fBe bench lands are successfully irrigated where there is a water supply and the very fine sandy loam and the silt loam soils of the table lands are successfully cultivated to wheat, corn, oats, rye, po - tatoes, and other crops. Dalton Table was one of the first parts of the region to gain prominence in agriculture. Its deep silt loam soil and the large crops of wheat raised thereon attracted much attention, and farming soon spread to most of the agricultural soils and, in some places, the sod of drouthy soils was broken. There remains, however, a considerable acreage of unplowed land suitable for cultivation. The best soils of the region are now farmed and no part of Nebraska is better supplied with machinery for farming on a large scale. It is a land of autos, tractors, and trucks. Wheat is the main crop on the uplands where big plows, large seeders, headers, and combines are generally in use. There is too much of a tendency for single cropping on some farms where wheat follows wheat year after year. This practice, If carried on much longer, may result in depleting the producing capacity of the soils. It will emphasize the big problem in the maintenance of nitrogen and humus. Irrigation is carried on in much of Lodgepole Valley where there id available water, and in parts of the South Platte, as below Jules - burg. Practically all of Lodgepole Creek is used for Irrigation by various small projects. The largest project, in the vicinity of Klmball, covers 7,000 acres. Its reservoir, 7% miles west of the city, stores </seg>
            <seg id="p267">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 267 flood water which is released and carried through canals to the exten - sive bench land between Kimball and the Cheyenne County line. Alfalfa, sugar beets, potatoes, wheat, oats, corn, and fruits are grown under this irrigation. Stock raising has considerable Importance in the Cheyenne Tablet country. It is based on grass, wild hay, some alfalfa, and grain feeds. The rough lands and drouthy soils are pastured. Wild hay is cut on some of the upland and on sub-irrigated alluvial lands. Much forage is grown throughout the region. Corn and forage constitute the main feeds. Poultry is found on practically all farms. Hogs are quite common, but cattle represent the largest development of the live stock industry. Some animals are shipped off the summer and fall range and others are finished for market on home grown feeds. A few horses are raised on most farms. The density of population is greatest in Lodgepole Valley and on the best soils of the table lands. Much of the country is well improved as to roads and farm buildings. The Lincoln Highway and the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad follow Lodgepole Valley and the Alliance-Denver branch of the Burlington crosses the area. The principal cities are Kimball, Sidney, and Chappell which compare well with places of their size in eastern Nebraska. Land Values of this region range from about $10 to about $250 an acre. The lowest valuation is for the rough stony land. The pasture lands or drouthy soils sell at $12 to $25 or more an acre, whereas the best farm lands on the tables run from $90 to more than $150 an acre, depending on soil, location and improvements. The highest priced land is under irrigation in the vicinity of Kimball.

PUMPKIN CREEK VALLEY This division of the High Plains Region occupies parts of Banner, Scotts Bluff, and Morrill counties. It lies between the escarpment of Cheyenne Table and Wildcat Ridge, and opens into the North Platte Valley (Figure 17). Its course is eastward from the Wyoming line to southeast of Bridgeport, a distance of about 50 miles, and is bordered most of the way by escarpment-like walls. The valley has a width of 6tt to 13 miles and an area of 455 square miles. The elevation Is 4,600 feet at the Wyoming line and about 3,600 feet near the east end of the valley. </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The exact origin of this valley is not known beyond dispute. It is known, however, that it was formed principally by water and wind erosion. The valley seems too large for its small trunk stream. Various persons have tried to account for the size of Pumpkin Creek Valley and most of them have concluded that, at an earlier period, the stream was much longer and larger than now, or that the Platte has occupied this valley. Perhaps the best view of the matter is that Pumpkin Creek formerly extended into Wyoming and included Bear Creek, and that Horse Creek, a tributary of the Platte, developed southward, cut off the upper part of Pumpkin Creek, robbing the stream of Its headwater drainage and thereby decreasing its length and volume. Pumpkin Creek Valley is a lowland containing several valleys, colluvlal slopes, and long, hilly spurs. It is what might be called a "greater valley." , PUMPKIN CREEK VALLEY SOILS The soils of this area are residual, colluvial, alluvial and aeolian in origin. They bear a close relation to the geological formations which underlie and border the valley. All of the soils have been modified to some extent by wind. The types with largest distribution are loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, and silt loam. They are porous, quite well drained, and fairly productive. The soils of Pumpkin Creek Valley were derived from the Brule Clay Formation, from colluvial materials washed and blown from the uplands north and south of the area, and from alluvial materials gathered from various formations. The principal series of soils are the Bridgeport, Tripp, Epping, and Laurel, but the Rosebud, Valentine, and Cheyenne are represented. Residual Soils— The Rosebud soils on the upper slopes in the south part of the area are underlain with light colored sand rock. They are thin, grading from the stony loam to fine sandy loam, and arc used for grazing which requires 8 to 10 acres to pasture an animal during the season. The Epping soils are the residual types of Brule clay, which Is at or near the surface In much of the Pumpkin Creek area. Those parts of this area where the Brule clay Is not mantled with colluvial or other material have given rise to the well-known Epping silt loam which is light brown in the surface layer, a little heavier in texture and lighter in color in the upper subsoil, and grades downward into the unmodified Brule clay. This soil occurs on the Brule slopes of the hills and spurs in the southern and northwestern parts of the Pumpkin Creek area. It supports a good growth of nutritious grasses, </seg>

The Epping silt loam grades into the very fine sandy loam which is eroded In spots as incipient bad lands. Coll u vial Soils — A considerable part of this area is occupied by soils having a complicated origin. These soils mantle the various kinds of slopes which extend to the valley bottoms, but they contain very little residual material. On the contrary, the material was derived from the Rosebud and Epping soils and from the rough lands. by a combination of alluvial, colluvial and wind action, and deposited on the lower Brule slopes. All these soils, representing eight types, are classed with the Bridgeport series. The Bridgeport soils are grayish to brown in the surface layer, which is 6 to 12 inches thick. The subsoil resembles the surface soil in color and texture to a depth of 2 or 3 feet. The lower subsoil is quite calcareous. Small amounts of gravel occur on the surface of these soils. Five of the Bridgeport types, and a phase of one of them, have most importance in the Pumpkin Creek area. They are the loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam (rolling phase), very fine sandy loam, and the si If loam. The Bridgeport loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, and the rolling phase of the fine sandy loam occupy most of the steep slopes at the foot of Wildcat Ridge north of Pumpkin Creek. Some of the surface on which these soils occur is modified by small, steep-sided gulleys. The rolling phase of the fine sandy loam occupies a broad inter - mittent belt just south of the bench land bordering Pumpkin Creek. Beyond this belt are areas of very fine sandy loam which extend south - ward into the tributary valleys. This type is especially well developed on the long gradual slopes in the southeastern parts of the area where the Bridgeport silt loam occurs in some of the small depressions. The Bridgeport soils are adapted to a number of purposes. The lighter types are grazed and the heavier ones are grazed, dry farmed, and irrigated where there is a water supply. Terrace Soils — The Tripp series is represented on the bench lands, which rise from 10 to 15 feet above Pumpkin Creek, by several types. The loamy fine sand is the most extensive, but it includes small areas of the loamy very fine sand and fine sandy loam. The nearly flat lands at the west end of Pumpkin Creek Valley, i.e., near the Wyoming line, are occupied principally by the Tripp fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam. The heavier types of the Tripp soils are quite well suited to dry farming. They are irrigated to alfalfa, corn, and wheat, where there </seg>
            <seg id="p271">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 271 is a water supply. The lighter types are used nearly exclusively for grazing. First Bottom Soils — There are narrow strips of first bottoms along most of the tributary valleys. Their soils vary from river wash to the Cheyenne sandy loam and support only thin growths of grass and shrubs. Pumpkin Creek is bordered most of fts length by the Laurel loamy sand and the sandy loam. This strip, from 100 feet to one - fourth mile in width, is sub-irrigated. It is used for pasture and a small amount of hay production. Wind-formed Soils-— The rolling phase of the Bridgeport fine sandy loam shows evidence of wind action. There is a small strip of Valen - tine very fine sand along the eastern border of 66 Mountain near the Wyoming line. Small patches occur farther east. The Valentine fine sand occurs in the southwestern part of Scotts Bluff County, and as small patches farther east. Two larger bodies are located a few miles southwest and southeast of Alden, a station on the Burlington Rail - road. Dunesand is found in association with most of the Valentine toils. DEVELOPMENT OF PUMPKIN CREEK VALLEY This area is largely a grazing district. The soils produce nutritious grasses for pasture purposes, and some hay. A low per cent of the stable soils is dry farmed and part is irrigated. The cultivation produces forage and grain feeds but not enough to finish all of the livestock for market. The valley lies too high in most of its length to be irrigated by canals from the Platte. This is an unfortunate condition since much of the land is well suited for irrigation. The Pumpkin Creek area is thinly settled, partly because it is a grazing district, but more on account of its isolation caused by the rough land barriers and a lack of railroads. No doubt, a much larger amount of land would be farmed if the valley had a railroad. Pumpkin Creek Valley has a low mileage of improved wagon roads, and most of this improvement is on highways leading across the area betwen points in the North Platte and Lodgepole valleys. Land Values range from $10 to about $130 an acre. The poorest grazing land has the lowest value. Dry farming land sells at $30 tc $50 an acre, depending on the soil, location and improvements. The value of irrigated land ranges from $70 to $130 an acre.

            <seg id="p272">272 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WILDCAT RIDGE The Nebraska part of this mountainous area lies between the North Platte and Pumpkin Creek valleys (Figure 16). It occupies parts of Scotts Bluff, Banner, and Morrlll counties, covering an area of 161 square miles. The ridge in Wyoming includes Eagle Rock, Bear Creek Mountain and the 66 Mountain which extends into Nebraska. From this point, the ridge extends northeastward, then eastward turning a little to the south, ending in Court House and Jail Rock south of Bridgeport. The total length of the ridge. Including the outliers of Wyoming and Ne - braska, is about 70 miles. The main part of the area, as It occurs in Nebraska, lies between Signal Butte on the west and Roundhouse Rock on the east, a distance of 40 miles. The principal outliers in Nebraska are 66 Mountain, Eagle's Nest, Bald Peak, and Court House and Jail Rock. Most of the main part of the ridge in Nebraska stands abruptly above the lowlands bordering it and is deeply cut by canyons (Figure 18). Much of the border is formed by nearly vertical walls developed on the Gering Formation, below which are the low Brule slopes leading downward and away from the ridge, and above which is the light colored, soft Arikaree sandstone, with a rough topography which rises and retreats to the crest of the ridge. The ridge varies in width from less than a mile to more thau six miles. In most of its length, the crest stands between 400 and 70V feet above the Pumpkin Creek and North Platte valleys, but lowers eastward. Three spurs extend northeastward from the ridge and end in Scottsbluff Mountain, Castle Rock, and Chimney Rock. A prominent spur on the south ends in Hog Back and Wildcat moun - tains. Among the prominent features of Wildcat Ridge in Nebraska are Signal Butte, elevation 4,583 feet; Scottsbluff Mountain, 4,462 feet; Hog Back Mountain, 5,082 feet; Wildcat Mountain, 6,038 feet; Castle Rock, 4,473 feet; Chimney Rock, 4,242 feet; and Roundhouse Rock, 4,256 feet. The outliers — Bald Peak, Eagle's Nest, and Court House Rock — have elevations of 4,420, 4,760, and 4,100 feet respectively. SOILS OF WILDCAT RIDGE Not including the types on the small valleys which Indent the area and which are classed with the lowlands, the soil resources of the ridge are meagre. Much of the surface is rough stony land. A considerable part of the top of the Ridge is occupied by the Rosebud stony fine sand and the smoother parts have the loamy fine sand and slightly heavier soils, a small amount of which is farmed. </seg>
            <seg id="p273">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 273 UTILIZATION OF WILDCAT RIDGE This area was a source of firewood and timber to the early settlers, and scattered pines and cedars remain on most parts of the ridge. Very good stands of these trees occur on some of the protected spots. Broad - leaf trees, such as box elder, green ash, and cottonwoods of two kinds, together with chokecherries and plums, grow in some of the canyons. Figure 18. Scene in Wildcat Ridge. Practically all of the ridge is grazed to cattle and horses. In one sense, this area is not a resource at all. It is a barrier against the development of roads and communication which for years was strong enough to isolate Pumpkin Creek Valley from the Platte. This condition, during the past few years, has been overcome to a consider - able extent by the building of auto roads across Redington Pass, over the divide south of Gerlng, and at other places. So it is now possible to make an easy journey across the ridge and to enjoy one of Nebraska's most scenic areas.

            <seg id="p274">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 274 NORTH PLATTE VALLEY This valley is bordered on the north by Box Butte Table and the sandhills and on the south by Wildcat Ridge and Cheyenne Table. It is very wide across Scotts Bluff and most of Morrill County, beyond which it narrows to a width of 2 to 4 miles which is retained to the South Platte Valley. The valley has a length of 163 miles, a maximum width of 35 miles at the state line, and an area of 1,129 square miles. It lies from 400 to 800 feet below the bordering high lands and drops from an elevation of 4,030 on the river, at the state line, to 2,940 feet on the valley floor north of Sutherland, or an average of a little less than 7 feet per mile. The North Platte area is more than a single valley. It is a lowland containing a trunk valley floor, several tributary valleys, wide slope lands, high terraces, and hilly lands. The topographic divisions in Scotts Bluff County, named from south to north, are as follows: (1) a wide belt of col lu vial and alluvial slope land extend - ing from the foot of Wildcat Ridge to the alluvial bottom lands; (2) a strip 2 to 5 miles wide of first bottom land and low terraces; (3) a high terrace 2 to 6 miles wide; (4) a broad undulating to hilly belt modified by basin-like valleys (Figure 17). SOILS OF NORTH PLATTE VALLEY The soils of North Platte Valley are classed under the following series: Tripp, Mitchell, Bridgeport, Minatare, Laurel, Epping, and Valentine (Figure 19). In Figure 19, Part B shows a strip of land from Chimney Rock northward a distance of thirteen miles. The soils are on steep slopes, the flood plain, bench land and slope land. The soil types, shown on 19 A, are: X, rough broken land; 2, Bridgeport loamy fine sand; 8, Bridgeport loamy very fine sand; 4, dunesand; 5, Tripp loamy very fine sand; 6, Tripp very fine sandy loam; 7, Tripp loamy fine sand; 8, Tripp loam; 9, Tripp gravelly sandy loam; 10, Bridgeport very fine sandy loam; 11, Rosebud very fine sandy loam; 12, poorly drained areas on bench land; 13, Rosebud very find sandy loam (shallow phase); 14, Rosebud loam; 15, dry stream bed, a gravelly sandy loam; 16, Laurel loam; 17, Minatare loam; 18, Laurel very fine sandy loam; 19, Minatare silt loam; 20, river wash, not shown by Arabic numerals, but represented by clear areas in Platte River.

The soils are of residual, col - luvial, and aeolian origin. Mitchell Bottom, which extends from the state line to Scottsbluff Mountain, is largely occupied by silt loam soils. The southwestern, part has been mapped as the Epping silt loam, but most of the rest of the area, except a body of Valentine loamy fine sand, nearly south ot Morrill, has Mitchell silt loam and very fine sandy loam, both of which are well adapted to dry farming and irrigation. They are brown - ish to dark in the surface layer and light buff In the subsoil which has about the same texture as the upper layer. There are a few places on this bottom where the Brule clay and Chadron formations are badly gullied. There is a small bad land •rea at the foot of Scottsbluff Mountain. Gering Valley is largely occupied by Mitchell very fine sandy loam and silt loam. There are small areas of Epping silt loam and eroded land on the upper slopes. Bodies of the Valentine loamy fine sand occur about 4 miles south and 3 to 5 miles east of Gering. Much of Gering Valley is dry farmed and irrigated. Melbeta Flat is occupied by Mitchell soils, about 2 square miles of Epping silt loam located on the southwestern part, and about 3 miles of dunesand and Valentine soils northwest of Castle Rock. A considerable area of this flat is irrigated. The rest is dry farmed and pastured. McGrew Valley, which has been called Horseshoe Flats, has largely Mitchell very fine sandy loam and silt loam, bordered on some of the higher slopes by Epping silt loam. There is an area of dunesand west of Chimney Rock. From Chimney Rock to Pumpkin Creek below Bridgeport, the south side soils are quite sandy. They are principally the loamy fine sands of the Bridgeport and Valentine series, and dunesand. There are patches of the Bridgeport fine sand (rolling phase) at the edge of the lowland, and dunesand occupies much of the higher land between Roundhouse Rock and Courthouse Rock. Much of the soil from Chimney Rock eastward is grazed, some is used for native hay, and considerable areas are dry farmed and Irri - gated. From Pumpkin Creek eastward to the Garden County line, the slope land has less dunesand. It is occupied by various light to heavy types of the Bridgeport and Valentine series. </seg>
            <seg id="p277">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 277 First Bottom and Low Bench Soils These form a belt 2 to 5 miles wide along the river, and small areas along the tributary valleys. Much of the surface is nearly level. The terraces rise from 1 to 20 feet above the flood plain which is from 1 to 2 or 3 feet above the river. The alluvial belt has an area of about 376 square miles of which about 80 square miles is occupied by the river and river wash. Narrow to wide belts of the Laurei soils border the North Platte throughout its length in Nebraska. The loamy sand and the very fine sandy loam prevail. These soils, being sub-irrigated from the river, grow good stands of native grasses for pasture and hay. They are used nearly exclusively for hay production at places in the eastern part of the valley. The Minatare soils, usually forming narrow belts just outside the Laurel soils, occupy a considerable part of the low ground and the low - est benches, beginning about 3 miles east of Scottsbluff and extending as large or small areas throughout most of the length of the valley. The largest body of the Mitchell silt loam, 1 to 3 miles wide, is north of the river between central Scotts Bluff County and east of Bayard. There are areas of considerable size on both sides of the valley between McGrew and Broad water. Three types of the Minatare series have been mapped in the valley, namely, the silt loam, loam, and very fine sandy loam. The Minatare soils are light gray in their surface layer, and underlain by heavy clay. They support native grasses and sedges and are largely used for pasture and hay. A relatively small acreage is irrigated. The silt loam, especially, has a tendency to become alkalied as a result of seepage from the higher-lying soils. Low benches are well developed in North Platte Valley; most of the valley towns are on these benches. Smaller low terraces occur in Spotted Tail, Nine-mile, Pumpkin Creek, and other tributary valleys. The Tripp fine sandy loam occupies most of the low terraces. There are places, however, where the very fine sandy loam prevails, as between Bayard and Broadwater. Some of the benches farther east are occupied by loamy fine sand and very fine sandy loam. The low bench lands at most places are highly productive and irrigated to alfalfa, beets, and other crops. High Terrace Soils A feature of the North Platte Valley is the high bench which extends from the Wyoming line to 6 miles east of Bayard. This bench stands from 50 to 100 feet or more above the first bottom of the North </seg>

It is cut across by a number of small creek valleys and is roughened somewhat along the northern border. There are many ■mall outlying areas of high bench land north of the main area. The terrace is largely occupied by the Tripp soils. The south edge, where sand and gravel outcrop, has a narrow strip of gravelly tandy loam, which is quite drouthy. This type occurs also on some of the high points farther north. Much of the remainaer of the surface has soils suited to irrigation. The Tripp very fine sandy loam is the leading type. It occupies the smoothest bench land from northeast of Morrill to north of Bayard. Parts of the Dutch Flats north of Morrill and some of the area northeast of Mitchell are occupied by the loamy fine sand. A rolling phase of this type occurs along the north edge of the terrace in the eastern part of Scotts Bluff County. The bench northeast of Bayard is occupied by the Tripp loam which grades into loamy very fine sand on the north. The high bench land of the North Platte Is one of the most ideal irrigation areas in the United States. It has productive soils, lies well for irrigation, and does not develop seepage areas. The North Side Soil Belt This begins in southwestern Sioux County, extends across northern Scotts Bluff and through Morrill County to northeast of Bridgeport. It is occupied by remnants of the high terrace, and by hills and basin-like valleys which open from one another in a southeasterly direction. This belt is between the main part of the high terrace and Box Butte Table in most of its course but, on the east, it slopes downward to the low benches and first bottom lands bordering the river. The soils of this belt belong to several series. There are small patches of the Epping tilt loam and eroded surfaces on some of the upper slopes. Much of the smoother slope land is covered with the Bridgeport very fine tandy loam and lighter types. The terrace-like areas and bench lands are occupied by Bridgeport and Tripp soils which are the very fine sandy loam and lighter types. The Valentine Ic-amy fine sand has areas of considerable size west, and 2 miles east of Lake Minatare. Much of the soil of this belt is adapted to dry farming and a large amount of it is irrigated. The lighter soils, not favorably located for irrigation, are pastured. </seg>
            <seg id="p279">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 279 DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH PLATTE VALLEY Soil and irrigation water have been the important factors in the development of this area. The broad areas of productive land are under government and private irrigation projects. The North Platte project stores flood waters in the Pathfinder Reservoir southwest of Casper (Figure 20), Wyoming, carries the water on the river bed to the Whalen Dam and diverts it through long canals to the big storage reservoirs in Scotts Bluff County from which the water is distributed to thousands of acres of fertile soil. The Tri-state Project is the second in size; it diverts at a big dam east of Henry, through one of the largest canals which extends onto the best land of the high terrace. There are many other irrigation projects in the valley whose canals have a total length of several hundred miles. Figure 20. The Pathfinder Dam which impounds water for irrigation in Nebraska. Irrigation in the North Platte has greatly increased production. Among the leading crops grown are alfalfa, sugar beets, wheat, corn, oats, rye, and potatoes. Many kinds of vegetables and fruits are raised. All told, North Platte Valley is one of the most productive and progressive parts of the state. Much of the area is quite thickly settled. There is a considerable mileage of improved roads and the valley is served by the Burlington and Union Pacific railroads. There are a number of growing towns the largest being Scottsbluff, Gering, Bayard, Bridgeport, Mitchell, Morrill, Mlnatare, Osnkosh, and Lewellen. </seg>

BOX BUTTE TABLE This sub-division of the High Plains lies between the Niobrara and North Platte valleys, is bordered on the east by the Sandhill Region, and extends westward into Wyoming. Its area, about 2,010 square miles, includes southern Sioux, most of Box Butte, and parts of Sheridan, Garden, Morrill, and Scotts Bluff counties. The surface along the northern and southern borders is hilly to quite rough. The surface of much of the table land proper varies from rolling to nearly level. An intermittent belt of sandhills extends across the area from northwest to southeast and joins a spur of the Sand - hill Region southwest of Alliance. The elevation of Box Butte Table drops from about 4,800 feet at the state line to less than 3,900 feet on the southeast. The annual rainfall is between 16 and 19 inches; the growing season is 130 to 136 days and the mean annual temperature at Alliance is 46.7 F. Good well water occurs at depths of 100 to 250 feet. BOX BUTTE TABLE SOILS The soils were derived principally from the Arikaree Formation winch underlies the area. Most of the soil has been re-worked to some extent by wind. The leading series are the Dunlap, Rosebud, Yale, Tripp, and Valentine. The Dunlap silt loam occupies the high, nearly level remnants of the original plain. Its largest distribution is in the vicinity of Heming - ford, lying mostly to the southwest and extending as far south as west of Berea. This soil resembles the Rosebud silt loam but occupies a higher and more level topographic position and is underlain by a heavier subsoil. Much of the type is farmed to such crops as wheat (Figure 21), corn, rye, oats, and potatoes. The Rosebud Soils cover much of Box Butte Table. They range in texture from fine sandy loam to silt loam. Passing across the region from east to west, one may see areas of Rosebud silt loam, very fine sandy loam and of the fine sandy loam in association with the loamy fine sand. The silt loam occupies much of northeastern and central Box </seg>
            <seg id="p281">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 281 Butte County. The very fine sandy loam occurs in a considerable part of Sioux County west of Hemingford. This soil extends onto the gradual upper slopes of the valleys but gives way on the steeper slopes to the fine sandy loam and the loamy fine sand. Much of the hard land of southern Sioux County is Rosebud very fine sandy loam and sandy loam. The various edges of the table land, lying between the sandhills and the North Platte Valley, are occupied on their smooth parts by very fine sandy loam, and by lighter soils on the steeper slopes. Figure 21. A typical view on Box Butte Table, near Heming - ford, showing heavy sod wheat beside the natural sod on the Dunlap silt loam. The heavier types of the Rosebud soils are dry farmed generally and this is particularly true of the silt loam which produces corn, wheat, oats, potatoes, and some alfalfa. The lighter types are used mostly for grazing and wild hay. The Yale silt loam occupies the high benches of Snake and Box Butte creeks. The largest area is just east of Alliance. Other areas are 7 miles northeast of Alliance and just east of Wild Horse Butte, </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE located 12 miles north and 2 miles east of Alliance. The soil is nearly level, quite deep, productive, and nearly all farmed. The surface soil consists of a light brown to brown, mellow silt loam containing varying quantities of very fine sand. The upper subsoil passes abruptly into a rather compact, light yellowish-brown to grayish - brown silt loam which changes at a depth of 20 to 24 inches to light gray or grayish-yellow silt loam. The soil and the upper sub - soil carry a low content of lime, while the lower subsoil is highly calcare - ous. Much of this soil section is underlain at a depth of 3 to 6 feet by waterworn gravel. The Tripp very fine sandy loam occurs on the low terraces which occupy much of Snake Creek bottom. The largest extent of this soil is immediately south of Alliance. The type is used for grazing, hay, and dry farming. Some of it is irrigated. The Laurel silt loam forms most of the first bottom of Snake Creek Valley. It occurs as a discontinuous strip one-fourth to three - fourths mile wide. This soil is used for grazing, native hay produc - tion, dry farming, and a small amount is irrigated. The type is quite badly alkalied at places. The Valentine loamy fine sand and associated types form a belt between the hard table lands and the Sandhill Region. This belt is well developed to the northeast of Alliance, extending into Sheridan County and to the Niobrara Valley. A similar belt is south of Snake Creek, and very small bodies occur in the sandhill areas of southern Sioux County in association with the dune sand. Both the Valentine and dunesand are used for grazing and hay. There are places, however, where the heavier Valentine soils are cul - tivated to corn, wheat, rye, and potatoes. DEVELOPMENT OF BOX BUTTE TABLE The conditions in this area are similar to those of Cheyenne Table except that there are larger areas of dunesand and Valentine soil. Much of the western part of the area is in ranches and most of the eastern part is giving way to farming (Figure 22). The Dunlap silt loam and the Rosebud silt loam support extensive farming in which machinery has an important part. The potato industry has assumed importance in this area. The crop is grown on the silt loams and very fine sandy loam. Box Butte County has grown crops of 1,000,000 bushels of potatoes. The extensive grass lands, the production of much forage, and con - siderable grain, make this an important stock raising district. Cattle, horses, and hogs are the leading kinds of live stock.

The ranch country is thinly settled; the farming areas are quite veil populated and much of the country is improved as to roads and farm homes. The Burlington's Billings line crosses the area and a branch line extends from Alliance to Denver. The principal towns are Hemingford and Alliance, the latter having a population of over 5,000. Land Values — The poorest grazing land is valued at $8 to $15 an acre. Some of the ranches in the western part of the area, having both hard and sandy land, are valued at $15 to $25 an acre. The second-grade farm land sells at $25 to $40 or $50 an acre and the best grade ranges In price from $50 to $100, depending on the soil, location, and improvements. Places close to Alliance and Hemingford have sold considerably higher.

THE NIOBRARA AREAS The Nlobrara areas do not form a distinct soil region. There are three divisions — the upper, middle, and lower. The upper or western part, a valley, extends across Sioux, Box Butte, Dawes, and a few miles of Sheridan County. The middle course, which is the valley and narrow, bordering table lands, extends from western Sheridan County to the vicinity of Valentine, and the lower part, the valley and bordering table lands, continues from this point to northern Knox County. WESTERN NIOBRARA The valley is U-shaped from the Wyoming line eastward about 10 miles where it widens and retains a broad V-shaped form to Sheridan County (Figure 23). The valley floor in most of this distance lies 300 to 400 feet below the table land level. Its width ranges from 1-4 mile to a little over 1 mile. Much of the slope land of the valley sides is gradual and grass covered. The principal tributary valleys on the north are of Cotton wood, Pebble, and Pepper creeks. Those on the south are of Whistle, Dry, and Box Butte creeks. These valleys are quite rough in their upper and middle parts but widen out with pomparatively smooth sides where they Join the Niobrara Valley proper. Soils of the western Niobrara are on slope lands, terraces, and flood plains. The slope land or Rosebud types are described with </seg>
            <seg id="p285">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 285 the table lands. The benches stand 10 to 20 feet above the river, extend through most of the trunk valley, and are occupied by the Tripp fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam which are grazed, used for native nay, and cultivated to alfalfa, corn, wheat, rye, po - tatoes, etc. About 15 per cent of the bench land is under irrigation. The Laurel soils form a narrow strip of first bottom land along the Niobrara and the lower courses of the principal tributary valleys. These soils resemble the Tripp types in texture, but are lighter in color because of a lower content of organic matter. They are largely sub-irrigated and used for grazing and hay production. A small acreage is cultivated. Figure 23. The open course of Niobrara Valley in Sioux County. Development in this part of the Niobrara has been influenced by the use of river water for stock and irrigation. The ranch buildings and improvements are close to the river, or in the creek valleys. This is a stock raising district devoted principally to cattle. The Rosebud soils will carry from 40 to 65 or more cattle per section during the season and the Tripp soils have a little greater capacity. The bottom lands produce adequate hay and some grain for winter feeding. Land values are determined by the sale of large holdings which usually occupy several soil types. The price is governed by the </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE amounts of pasture land, hay land, and of farm land under Irriga - tion. Places with little of the best land are valued at $15 to $20 an acre; those with more of the bottom land and some irrigation ■ell for $25 to $30 or more per acre. MIDDLE NIOBRARA This division has an area of about 257 square miles including the valley and table land. The valley is deep, narrow, and bordered by talus slopes and stony outcrops which support some grass and fairly good stands of pines. The principal tributaries on the south are Pine, Snake, and Gordon creeks. Those on the north are Hay Springs, Rush, Antelope, and Bear creeks. A fairly well defined table land extends on the south side of the valley from western Sheridan County to a point southwest of Cody. It varies from % to about 2% miles in width and stands from 100 to 200 feet above the river. A wider and more irregular table north of the river extends from a point opposite where the south table ends to about 12 miles southwest of Valentine. There are small table lands east of the lower course of Snake Creek, between the lower part of Bear Creek and the Niobrara, and east of Valentine. The middle Niobrara table lands are bordered on their sides away from the river by high sandhills. This gives them a terrace-like appearance. The Principal Soils of the middle Niobrara course belong to the Valentine, Tripp, and Laurel series but some Rosebud soils are repre - sented. The Valentine soils occupy much of the table land and range from nearly pure sand to the very fine sandy loam. The lighter types are used for pasture and hay; heavier ones are used for hay, or culti - vated to corn, rye, wheat, alfalfa, and potatoes. There are well developed farming districts on the Bear Creek flat, and a few miles southeast of Cody. The Tripp fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, and some silt loam occupy the high and low terraces of the Niobrara and the Laurel soils cover most of the first bottom. They are used for farming and grazing where cleared of the native forest. The Development of the Middle Niobrara is related to cattle railing which prevails on the bordering sandhill areas. The table and alluvial lands supply hay and grain for the ranches. The road between Valentine and Chadron follows the Niobrara tables from southwest of Cody to the river bridge 26 miles east of Rushville. It is in only fair condition. Land Values of the Middle Niobrara have a wide range. Farm and hay lands tell at from $30 to $60 an acre. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 287 LOWER NIOBRARA This area was formerly a smooth sand and gravel plain. Streams trenched the original plain, in comparatively recent times, and ex - posed the Arikaree, Brule, and Pierre formations. The upland, except in the east, where it is covered by loess, has been further modified by wind, resulting in the development of patches of sandhills which separate the remnants of the original plain into disconnected table lands called Crookston Table, Springview Table, Ainsworth Table, and Holt Plain. There is a considerable area of Pierre soils in Boyd, Knox and Holt counties. Figure 24. The lower course of the Niobrara east of Valentine.

The surface of Crook - ston Table is undulating to nearly level hard land although the south border is rough. The soils of this table are mostly the Rosebud fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam. They are successfully farmed to wheat, rye, corn, and potatoes. Land values are advancing. Springview Table Springview Table covers much of Keyapaha County but extends inio Cherry and Boyd counties. The surface is occupied by small, nearly level table lands separated by wind-formed knolls and hills. There are about U42 miles of hard land and 126 square miles of choppy to hilly sandy land. The edges of the area are cut by canyons and steep slopes of the Keyapaha and Niobrara valleys developed on the sand plain, the Arikaree Formation, Brule clay and Pierre shale. The Soils of this area were derived from material of the sand and gravel plain and the underlying formations. The principal soil series are the Rosebud and O'Neill. There are small patches of the Pierre soils on some of the lower slopes of the Keyapaha and Niobrara valleys. Rosebud fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam form a nearly continuous narrow belt around the area, just inside the rough lands. The O'Xeill soils, derived from the sand gravel plain, are the gravelly loam and the loam. The first named has a thin, brownish loamy surface soil and a gravelly subsoil. It occupies much of the various small hard lands, one area being in the vicinity of Springview. The O'Neill loam has a brownish, tine sandy loam to silt loam surface soil with a depth of 8 to 12 inches, underlain by a yellowish-brown heavy loam to clay loam which rests on sand and gravel. The type has a limited distribution on the Springview Table but is a valuable agricultural soil. The gravelly loam is quite drouthy. The Valentine soils and dunesand form an Intermittent belt across the area from northwest to southeast. Much of this soil is well suited for grazing and native hay, but a small amount is farmed.

It is broken Into small tables by the deep valleys of Plum Creek and Long Fine Creek. The elevation is 3,226 at Bassett and 2,523 at Ainsworth. Much of the surface is hard land underlain by sand and the Arikaree Formation. The Principal Soils are of the Rusebud, Bassett, and Valentine series. The Rosebud fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam occupy most of the central part of the area. The Valentine soils are in the northeastern part and along the southern border. Inextensive bodies of dunesand occur in the Valentine areas and at a few places on the hard table land. The eastern part of Ainsworth Table is occupied by the Bassett silty clay which has a dark gray to brown loamy surface soil 7 to 14 inches deep, underlain by about 2 feet of similar material having a lighter color, below which is a heavy, light-colored, silty clay. This soil is well adapted to growing native grasses for hay. Ainsworth Table has considerable importance in general farming and stock raising, the only specialized industry is hay production on the Bassett silty clay. Some of the wagon roads are well improved. The Northwestern Railroad affords good transportation facilities. Us towns are Bassett, Long Pine. Ainsworth. and .Johnstown. Land Values range from about $18 an acre for the cheapest pas - ture land to more than $100 for the best farm land. Holt Plain Holt Plain is a poorly defined area bordered by the Niobrara and Verdlgre valleys on the north and east, and by the Sandhill Region and its outliers on the south and west. Its area is about 1.400 square miles, including some of the Elkhorn's drainage. The elevation is 1,978 feet at O'Neill and 2,110 feet at Atkinson. Drainage is to the Niobrara, Verdlgre, and Elkhorn.

The O'Neill loam occupies much of the smooth land in north central Holt County. It is a valuable agricultural soil. A narrow belt of O'Neill gravelly loam, a drouthy grazing soil, stretches several miles eastward from near O'Neill, and another area is south of the rough land bordering the Niobrara. Rough lands and light soils of the Rosebud series occupy some or the northwestern part of the area on the uplands south of the Niobrara in association with the Valentine. Valentine soils cover much of the northeastern and northwestern parts of the area and include some dunesand. The largest body of dunesand is north of the Elkhorn, between Page and north of Ewing. Pierre soils occur in parts of Eagle Creek Valley and along the south side of the Niobrara. The first bottom and bench lands of the Elkhorn are covered with very fine sandy loam and lighter types of the Laurel and Tripp series. They are suited to grazing, hay production, and some farming. The Bassett silty clay, covering about 40 square miles in the vicinity of Stuart and Newport, grows grass for native hay. Holt Plain is an important grazing and farming area with consider - able specialization in the various kinds of stock raising. Much of the country is well developed and one of its noticeable features is the large farm groves. The wagon roads are good to bad, depending upon the soils and amount of improvement. The Northwestern crosses the area, and its towns are O'Neill, Atkinson, Newport, and Stuart. Land Values range from about $20 an acre for t"he poorest pasture land to $150 or more for the best farm land. Pierre Soils In about 340 square miles of eastern Boyd, northern Holt, and northwestern Knoz County, the Tertiary formations have been eroded away and the topography and soils have been developed on the Pierre shale. A few areas of stony land, bordered by sandy loams, remain on the high divides, as in the vicinity of Twin Buttes, south of the town of Butte, southeast of Verdel and on parts of the divide between Bazile and Verdigre creeks. Elsewhere, much of the upland is occu - pied by the Pierre Formation. The soil on some of the smoothest divide land was derived from sandy materials mixed with the Pierre shale. It is a mellow silt loam, largely under cultivation. Much of Ponca Creek Valley, the steeper slopes on the north side of the Niobrara Valley in Boyd County, and the hilly lands between Verdigre and Bazile creeks are largely occupied by Pierre clay.

It extends through Sioux, Dawes, and Sheridan counties and has an area of about 1,475 square miles. It is not a typical table land in all parts. There are two principal divisions, and a third one is fairly well defined. The most typical table is in Dawes County lying just south of Pine Ridge. The second is in Sheridan County, at Rushville and Gordon. The third division, which is quite hilly, crosses Sioux County between Pine Ridge and the Niobrara Valley. The surface of Dawes Table varies greatly. There are rough borders, undulating to hilly slopes, and nearly flat tables. Some of the elevations are: Gordon, 3,556 feet; Rushville, 3,741; Hay Springs, 3,831; the high table of Dawes County, about 4,600; and the table at the Wyoming line northwest of Harrison, 5,050. The average rain fall is 20 on the east and 16 on the west. The growing season Is between 130 and 135 days. The mean annual temperature at Hay Springs is reported at 45.2° F. DAWES TABLE SOILS The soil conditions here are similar to those of Box Butte Table but there are fewer patches of dunesand. The leading series are the Rosebud and Dunlap, but the Valentine, Tripp, and Laurel are represented. The Rosebud silt loam and the very fine sandy loam are extensive in Sheridan County. A large area of the silt loam is north of the railroad between Rushville and the west county line and a second large area is north and northeast of Gordon. One of the largest bodies of the Rosebud very fine sandy toam begins north of Rushville and extends northeastward to within three miles of Gordon. The </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE silt loam and the very fine sandy loam, occur in many parts of Sheri - dan County. They give way on the hill sides and slopes to lighter types, such as the fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand. Patches of the Rosebud gravelly sandy loam occur in the vicinity of Gordon, Clinton, and Rushville. There is a considerable area of Rosebud tilt loam in Dawes County on the east, south and west of the level table. This grades, on the slopes, into a shallow phase and lighter types. Several square miles of silt loam occur in eastern Sioux County, Just south of Pine Ridge. Here, as in Sheridan and Dawes counties, the soil becomes lighter and thinner on the steeper slopes. The very fine sandy loam occupies much of the undulating areas in the vicinity of Harrison, and north of the Niobrara south of Harrison. It grades into lighter types on rougher areas. The Dunlap silt loam occupies 96 square miles of Dawes County, just south of Pine Ridge, and extends a short distance into Sheridan County. It grades locally into fine sandy loam and is bordered by the Rosebud soils. Here is one of Nebraska's best dry farming districts. Tripp soils, ranging from fine sandy loams to silt loam, occupy terraces in parts of Hay Springs, Rush, and Antelope valleys. They are used for grazing, wild hay, and farming. The principal crops are alfalfa, corn, wheat, oats, rye, and potatoes. Laurel, fine sandy loam, and very fine sandy loam occupy narrow strips in most of the main drainageways of Sheridan County leading to the Niobrara Valley. They are grazed or used for native hay, and a small acreage is farmed. Valentine soils, varying from the sand to very fine sandy loam, lie along the east and parts of the south edge of the area in Sheridan County. They are pastured, used for native hay, and some of the very fine sanay loam is farmed to corn, rye, potatoes, and other crops. DEVELOPMENT OF DAWES TABLE This area has passed through about the same development as the other table lands of the state. It started with cattle raising and shifted to grain and mixed farming on the agricultural soils and to the grazing of drouthy soils and rough lands. Most of the pasture land of the Rosebud series requires from seven to twelve acres per animal during the season. Much of the native hay land cuts from % to 1 ton per acre and the crop yields on the heavier soils are quite good. Stock raising has assumed considerable importance throughout the area, based on </seg>
            <seg id="p293">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 293 the good water, grazing areas, forage and grain feeds, and healthful conditions. Parts of the area are well developed as to farming, roads, and general improvements. The Northwestern Railroad crosses Sheridan County and its towns are Gordon, Clinton, Rushville, and Hay Springs. The Burlington crosses a narrow divide in the western part of Dawes County. Persons on the fertile table of Dawes County trade mostly in Chadron and are handicapped by not having shipping facilities nearer at hand. Autos and trucks are overcoming this drawback. The Northwestern crosses Sioux County and Harrison is its main town in this part of the area. Land Values range from about $15 an acre for the poorest pasture land to more than $125 an acre for the best farm land in the vicinity of Rushville and Gordon. Prices on the large tract of Dunlap silt loam, located south of Pine Ridge, are relatively low because of the distance from railroads.

It extends from Wyoming through Sioux, Dawes, and Sheridan counties into South Dakota and has an area of about 495 square miles in Nebraska. Most of the ridge slopes and drains to White River and Hat Creek basins. Pine Ridge contains deep canyons, prominent cliffs, buttes, long stony slopes, and the park lands. There are two escarpments in L&gt;awes County, the higher one rises to the level of the table land on the south. The other forms the nearly vertical, high cliffs at the edge of Hat Creek and White River basins. These cliffs are a noticeable feature between Fort Robinson and Crawford. The park lands (Figure 25) are best shown in Dawes County where they lie between the upper and lower escarpments and are crossed by several deep canyons with permanent streams. Pine Ridge stands from 600 to 800 feet above the edges of the basins on the north. It has an elevation of 5,050 feet at the Wyoming line, decreases to 4,600 feet in eastern Sioux County, and about 3,600 feet at the South Dakota line. Among the best known valleys of the area are Monroe, Sowbelly, West Hat, East Hat, West Ash, and Chadron canyons. Some of the prominent features are Coliseum Butte, Church Butte, Lover's Leap, and Crow Butte. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 294 PINE RIDGE SOILS Much of this area is occupied by rough stony land which supports gome grass and pine forest. The colluvial slopes and the park areas are occupied by Rosebud fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam which grow grass and pine trees and are cultivated to rye, wheat, potatoes, and other crops on the open places. The canyon floors are usually very narrow and covered with some stable soil which grows trees and several kinds of wild fruit. Figure 25. Parks and pines of the Pine Ridge Regions DEVELOPMENT OF PINE RIDGE This area is chiefly used for grazing. The park lands are success - fully farmed but they are isolated somewhat by the rough topography, The rough land and the light textured soils are well suited to growing forest Development of the region started with hunting, trapping, and the utilization of timber for firewood, ties, and some lumber. Much of the best timber was cut several years ago but sufficient seed trees were left for very good reproduction and the area is now covered with pines and cedars in stands of varying density. Pine Ridge is a barrier to transportation. Wagon roads pass through most of the canyons, connecting Dawes Table and Nlobrara Valley with the basins. The Northwestern crosses the low points but </seg>

HAT CREEK BASIN This area is in the northwestern part of Nebraska, covering the northern part of Sioux County and a few square miles of northwestern Dawes County. It lies between the Pine Ridge escarpment and the South Dakota and Wyoming lines and has, in Nebraska, an area of 392 square miles. Hat Creek Basin is a deeply eroded part of the High Plains. The Tertiary beds have been entirely removed from part of the area and several hundred feet of the Pierre shale eroded. The total thickness of beds removed here is approximately 1,500 feet. Crossing the area northward from the crest of Pine Ridge, one would pass over out - crops of the Arikaree, Gering, Brule, Chadron, and Pierre shale. The basin is well drained by streams which head in Pine Ridge, flow northward across the area, and join Hat Creek on the northeast where it passes into South Dakota as a tributary of the South Fork of Cheyenne River. Among the leading streams of Hat Creek Basin are Indian, Antelope, War Bonnet, Monroe, Sowbelly, West Hat, East Hat, and Whltehead creeks. Hat Creek Basin slopes away from Pine Ridge to an elevation of about 3,500 feet where Hat Creek leaves the state, but most points on the boundary between the basin and Pine Ridge have elevations between 4,300 and 4,500 feet. THE SOILS OF HAT CREEK BASIN The soils here occur In areas determined more or less by the outcrops of geological formations. They lie in fairly well defined belts, which, named from south to north are: (1) A coll u vial belt at the foot of Pine Ridge, occupied principally by the Dawes soils; (2) spurs and hills developed on the Brule clay and occupied by the Epping soils, and (3) the so-called dark gumbo land, occupied by the Pierre soils. </seg>
            <seg id="p296">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 296 The above soil belts are crossed by valleys along which are narrow strips of first bottom land and larger areas of well defined terraces. Colluvial Soils— jThere is an intermittent belt of comparatively steep colluvial slope land at the foot of Pine Ridge, on which the ■oil was derived from materials washed from the Gering and Arlkaree formations high in Pine Ridge, and deposited on the Brule slopes. The principal soil is the Dawes silt loam which shows three distinct layers in the soil section. The surface soil is a brown to dark brown silt loam; the upper subsoil, 6 to 12 inches thick, is a brown to dark grey, heavy, compact silty clay loam, and the lower subsoil is a yellowish brown, buff colored or almost white, heavy silt loam. This type is suited to general farming but, in this situation, is used very largely for pasture purposes. Soils Derived from Brule Clay — The Epping silt loam is the main soil of the Brule hills and ridges. It forms an intermittent belt across the area between the colluvial slope lands on the south and the Pierre clay on the north but grades locally into very fine sandy loam, and is eroded at places forming small bad lands of a few acres each. Two bad lands have 1,000 acres or more each. The Epping silt loam grows good pasture grasses and is used mostly for grazing. A small acreage is farmed. Pierre Soils — A large stretch of country in the northern part of the basin is occupied by the Pierre shale. It is part of a large tract which extends to the Black Hills and westward into Wyoming. The Pierre area varies from undulating to hilly. The soil with largest area is the Pierre clay. It has a smoky color, is very sticky when wet and cracks badly when dry. The surface soil passes at a shallow depth into unweathered Pierre shale. This type grows buffalo, grama, and wheat grasses, and is used mostly for grazing and some for hay during wet years. The rougher parts of the Pierre hills are occupied by a loam, which has more or less rock debris on the surface and includes small patches of rough stony land. This soil, derived in part from the Chadron Formation, is nearly all grazed. The Pierre soil of most value in the area is the clay loam. Most of it is grazed but some is farmed to small grains and corn. Terrace Soils — The terraces at the mouths of canyons opening out from Pine Ridge are quite narrow and short as a rule. Their soils, classed with the Tripp fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam, are grazed, dry farmed, and irrigated. The principal valleys in the central and northern parts of the area have well defined terraces, 12 to 20 feet high, and one-quarter </seg>
            <seg id="p297">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 297 to a mile wide. They are occupied by the Mitchell silt loam and Mitchell sandy clay loam, which are deep and productive. They are the most generally dry farmed soils in the county. The various creeks in the basin have very narrow flood plains. The soils of these first bottoms vary from river wash at the edge of Pine Ridge to the Laurel very fine sandy loam farther north. They grow grass, willows, box elder, and cottonwoods. DEVELOPMENT OF HAT CREEK BASIN The low rainfall, comparatively short growing season, poor water supply at places, and lack of transportation facilities are drawbacks in this area which is more or less isolated from the rest of Nebraska. It is necessary to climb the steep grades of Pine Ridge, through canyon roads, in order to reach the trading places along the Northwestern, and the distances to Ardmore, Orella, and Crawford on the Burlington represent long drives for most people in the basin. Orella, a place with less than 100 people, is the only town in the basin and it is at the edge of the area. Mansfield is a station on the Burlington. Hat Creek Basin is primarily a stock raising district. It has enough farming to produce vegetables for farm use and to grow forage crops and some grains for feed. The small streams are used to irri - gate about 3,500 acres of bench land. The water supply is scant and of poor quality in much of the basin. This is true on the Pierre lands and applies to much of the area in which the Brule clay is exposed. Most wells are on alluvial lands. Much of the water supply is from the streams. Hat Creek Basin is thinly settled. Most of the people live along the valleys having water supplies and fertile bench lands. Land Values are quite low. The poorest grazing tracts are valued at $2 or $3 an acre. Much of the pasture land ranges from $8 to $12, and the ranches, including various soil types, and a water supply, are listed at $20 to $25 an acre. Some of the best colluvial land is sold at $25 or more an acre and the best terrace land Is worth $40 to $50 an acre. WHITE RIVER BASIN This area is somewhat similar to Hat Creek Basin. It lies north of Pine Ridge, covers most of northern Dawes and parts of Sioux and Sheridan counties, and slopes away from the foot of Pine Ridge from an elevation of about 4,000 feet to 3,100 feet where White River passes into South Dakota. The area is about 862 square miles. </seg>
            <seg id="p298">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 298 • Much of White River Basin is undulating to hilly. Parts l.oar Pine Ridge have been developed on the Brule and Chadron formations and much of the country north of White River, except the wes urn part, is occupied by the Pierre hills, slopes, and ridges. A small area in the northeast was formed on the Nlobrara and Benton formations. About 2,000 feet of Tertiary and Cretaceous beds have been removed in the erosion of this basin by White River and its tributaries. WHITE RIVER BASIN SOILS The Rosebud very fine sandy loam forms an intermittent, narrow belt on the slopes at the foot of Pine Ridge. It extends into the lower courses of most of the canyons, occupies much of the broad slope land south and southwest of Crawford, and is used for grazing and farming. The Dawes silt loam, which grades locally into a lighter soil, forms a broad belt on the long colluvlal slopes developed on the Brule clay. There are many places in this distribution where the colluvial material has been removed by erosion and small bodies of Epping silt loam have been developed. In some places, excessive erosion has produced small badland areas. The Dawes silt loam is used for pasture, native hay, is cultivated to rye, alfalfa, wheat, corn, potatoes, and other crops. The Epping silt loam occurs as small, irregular bodies in the Dawes silt loam and forms larger areas along the Burlington Railroad between Crawford and Orella. More of the type is farmed here than in Hat Creek Basin. Pierre Soils occupy about 350 square miles of the northern part of the area. The silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, and clay types have been mapped and described. The clay has the largest distri - bution. The Pierre soils are grazed, used for hay and some farming. Some of the broad valleys in the Pierre clay area are mantled with the Orman silt loam and silty clay loam derived by the re-working of Pierre shale by streams. These types, occupying 14 square miles along Cottonwood Creek and White River, are used mostly for pas - ture, but some is cultivated. Alluvial Soils of the valley floors are divided between the first bot - toms and the well defined terraces in White River Valley and all the tributary valleys entering from Pine Ridge. The Tripp silt loam and very fine sandy loam occupy the terraces of White River between Whitney and the South Dakota line. These soils are extensively farmed both with and without irrigation. The terrace soils farther up White River are a little lighter in texture. The very fine sandy loan prevails on the wide terraces in the vicinity of Fort Robinson </seg>
            <seg id="p299">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 299 above Crawford. The benches of the White River tributary valleys entering from the south are largely occupied by the Tripp very fine tandy loam, most of which is cultivated. Most of the first bottom land of White River and the south tribu - taries is occupied by Laurel very fine sandy loam and some silt loam, the heavier type being along the lower course of the river. The Bohemian, Maiden, and Alkali creeks on the north have the silty clay loam. DEVELOPMENT OF WHITE RIVER BASIX This basin has very good railroad facilities and the main wagon roads have been improved. The Pierre land area is nearly exclusively a cattle and horse grazing district, the former predominating. The colluvial lands are better suited to alfalfa raising than is generally supposed but are being successfully cultivated to the lead - ing crops. The bench lands are especially well suited to alfalfa but much of their area is also being cultivated to other crops. The White River country is a prosperous agricultural district in the raising of alfalfa seed, potatoes, grains, and live stock. Land Values range from about $10 an acre for the poorest Pierre soil to $130 or more for the best bench land in the vicinity of Chad - ron. Ranches on Pierre soils have sold at from $20 to $30 an acre; farms on the Rosebud and Epping soils sell at from $50 t or more an acre.

            <seg id="p300">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 300 SOIL CONSERVATION PROBLEMS Soil is the state's greatest natural resource. It is the basis of moat development and its capacity to produce must be conserved in order to support the future prosperity of the state. Some of the land and soil problems of Nebraska are as follows: (1) Land has a high value compared with that of a few years ago. This increase in the capitalization of farms and ranches must be taken into account in the future, along with the labor item and other things in order to conserve the interests of land owners, tenants and the general welfare of the state. (2) Each soil of the state is better adapted to some uses than to others — a condition not to be abused by realtors, nor overlooked by farmers, the purpose being to secure the best utilization. (3) Single cropping to wheat or corn for several years has resulted in lowering the fertility of some soils. This practice should give way to a system of farming in which livestock have a more important place. (4) Some parts of the state have not practiced crop rotation. Enough is now known, however, of the soils in different localities, to serve in the establishment of systems of rotation suited to the soils, climate, and other conditions. The rotation should include alfalfa or some other legume to build up the nitrogen and humus contents of the soil. (5) The soils of some of the western counties present a problem in the maintenance of humus, because it is not easy to secure and maintain a good stand of alfalfa. Sweet clover might be used here, but it is in disfavor among many ranch owners and farmers. (6) Most soils of the state are quite well supplied with potash, lime, and other mineral matter necessary for plant growth, but there are soils, as on the drift hill area, where finely crushed limestone would be helpful. (7) Most commercial fertilizers are not balanced to suit the Ne - braska soils. (8) The state has many acres of unused land along the broad highways. A larger amount of this could be farmed and not allowed to grow weeds. (9) Field borders, roadside strips, and spaces along irrigation ditches should be carefully cleared, for the double purpose of checking the growth of weeds and destroying cover for hibernating insects. Cultivation of many fields is made difficult and expensive by the pres - ence each year of a border of weeds to re-seed the area. Inasmuch </seg>
            <seg id="p301">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 301 as the crop is either decreased through weed competition, or made more costly by reason of extra cultivation, this matter of weed borders is one of real economic importance. (10) The eradication of rodent pests should be effected, par - ticularly ground-squirrels and pocket-gophers, which disturb and occupy the soil by burrowing, and destroy crops. (11) Much soil is lost in the eastern parts of the state by hillside erosion and gulleying. Concerted action should be made to conserve the soil of hilly lands by placing obstructions in gulleys, by the growing of cover crops and by not plowing across the grass-covered sloughs. (12) Some of the soils of the western counties are well suited to farming, but there are kinds which produce more in their native sod than can be realized through farming, and with less damage to the soil. This means that the light drouthy soils and the heavy Pierre soils are better suited for grazing than for farming, and should be so managed. (13) Some of the smooth bottom lands, close to the water table, are especially adapted to growing native grasses for pasture and hay, and they should not be plowed up 'without careful consideration of the soil type as to blowing and crop adaptations. (14) The area of farm land in Nebraska can be extended consider - ably through drainage, irrigation and river control. (15) Land can be improved in its native state without plowing. The sandhills present an attractive field for further study and prac - tical management, the purpose being to improve the grasses and other grazing plants in order to increase the carrying capacity of the land. (16) Lastly, those who farm the land should have a high regard for the soil as the source of life, and handle it on a basis of fairness to the soil and its future possibilities, rather than rob it for imme - diate big yields. One who builds up the soil is a good citizen, a benefactor to succeeding generations, but one who lets the land run down or impoverishes the soil, does a thing which is fundamentally wrong. </seg>
