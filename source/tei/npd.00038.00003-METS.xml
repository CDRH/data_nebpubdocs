            <seg id="p003">SECRETARY OF THE STATE BANKING BOARD III State of Nebraska, Department of Banking, Lincoln, March 1, 1916. To His Excellency, John H. Morehead, Governor, Hon. Wm. H. Smith, Auditor of Public Account Hon. Willis E. Reed, Attorney General, Members of the Banking Board. Sirs: I beg to submit herewith the Twenty -fourth annual report of this de - partment for the period beginning October 31, 1914, and ending December 9, 1915. On the following pages of this report will be found comparisons, summaries and detailed reports of the banks under your supervision, 803 in number, with paid in capital stock amounting to $17,118,600.00, loans of $111,042,259.30, total deposits, $114,487,652.98, and total recources of $144, - 422,709.55, making an increase of $1,320,500.00 in capital stock during the year; in loans, $19,123,627.62; in deposits, $20,989,818.21, and in resources $24,873,170.74. I am pleased to report that there have been no failures of banks under your supervision since the suspension of the First State Savings Bank at Superior, which was placed in the hands of a receiver March 10, 1914, fol - lowing the failure of the First National Bank of Superior, with which it was closely connected. The winding up of the affairs of tht? First State Sav - ings Bank has been delayed more than was expected, on account of a large amount of its paper being secured by real estate mortgages, upon which it is slow to realize, foreclosure proceedings being brought in =»veral instances, and against which resistances of various kinds are having to be contended with. The banks of the state generally are well managed, and in a safe and solvent condition. The bank deposit guarantee law, so far, has proven a success and without question has strengthened the confidence of the people in the banks under your supervision. However, there is an element of danger under present conditions to which it is well to call your attention at this time. There is no question but that the guaranty fund accumulated is being im - periled by the multiplication of banks and an over supply of bank capital in the state. It is not so much the overcapitalization, as that is not a real menace, but the overcapitalization by the multiplication of banks certainly forebodes disaster sooner or later. To prevent this more power should be given your honorable body by legislative or judicial action, giving you sufficient authority to protect communities already provided with safe and solvent banks against the intrusion of speculators and promotors in bank - ing privileges. I cannot emphasize too strongly the dangers to the guaranty fund arising from these causes, especially under the conditions of easy money now prevailing. It is to be hoped the next legislature will amend the banking law so as to provide more efficient protection against these evils. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">IV TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE This department realizes that at a time of money plethora, like the present, breeds abuses that will be followed by penalties later on when conditions change. The accumulation of deposits in the banks under your supervision is evidence of the confidence the people have in our state banking system, and every citizen of the state is entitled to have a pardonable pride in the splen - did showing made. One feature that I desire to call to your attention is a no inconsider - able quantity of money that is being deposted in and loaned to our state banks on certificates of deposit, especially those made by banks and bankers outside the state, on account of the guaranty fund accumu - lated. Should the guaranty fund become imperiled, or conditions change, this money would be withdrawn at a time when the banks holding it may be illy prepared to pay it. This department feels that it is necessary to call your attention to this element of danger. The unfortunate failure of the Oklahoma guarantee law, which was partly due to the practice of advertis - ing for and soliciting funds outside the state, should be a warning to the banks of Nebraska. In the main the banking act of the state is being very well observed by the banks under your supervision. It naturally follows that in the large number of banks now operating under the state law, there should be here and there instances of reckless and incompetent management. Every effort is being made by this department to avoid disastrous consequences in such cases, and so far we are entitled to congratulate ourselves that supervision has been sufficient to protect the guaranty fund and depositors, as well as it has. While it is generally conceded that the record of Nebraska's bank su - pervision is second to none, it will require constant care, rigid control, and sometimes arbitrary action on the part of the supervising authority to keep the reputation of the banks of the state up to the present standard. I desire to extend to you my sincere appreciation and gratitude for your wise counsel and valuable co-operation in the administration of the affairs of the department. To the State Bank Examiners and the members of the office force, and also to Mrs. M. M. Heffley, Messrs. Henry C. Berge and J. Murphy, clerks, and to Mr. Paul Jones, examiner, who retired from the service some time ago to engage in other business and work, I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks for their competent and faithful services. Respectfully submitted, E. ROYSE Secretary State Banking Board. </seg>
