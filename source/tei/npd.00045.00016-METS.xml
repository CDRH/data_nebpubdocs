            <seg id="p002">FOREWORD Belter method* of feeding would undoubtedly greatly increaite the production of dairy products in Nebraska and would increase the economy of production as well. The purpose of this bulletin is to assist in making this possibility a reality. An effort has been made to present as clearly as possible the requirements of dairy cown and to offer practical suggestions for meeting those requirements. The method of calculating a bal - anced ration is shown and discussed, and a number of grain mixtures adapted to the different sections of the Si ate have been calculated and included in the bulletin. Calculations are based on the most reliable data available at this time, and care has been taken to make assumptions apply as nearly as possible to average Nebraska conditions. The in - tention has been to be specific and yet leave sufficient latitude for the exercise of judgment; for, after all, no set of instructions or mere code of rules, however complete, can take the place of careful and studious application combined with good judgment. </seg>

VMKHlWMCIl USES OF FOOD A dairy cow requires food mainly for Iwo pur|NMu» 1 Maintenance, Under normal condition!, a cow in milk first taken from her ration a sufficient amount of food for maintenance, and the remainder of the ration is available for milk product ion. The amount of food required for maintenance varies with the size of the cow but is practically the name whether she in dry or ih in full flow of milk, while the amount required for milk pro - duction varies, of course, with the amount of milk she in producing. A medium-producing cow uses about 50 per cent of her entire ration for maintenance. The proportion of the ration used for this purpose varies widely, depending upon the quantity con - sumed. The larger the ration consumed the smaller the per cent of the entire ration that is used for maintenance, and therefore the greater the per cent that in available for milk production. The following illustrations are only approximate but will servt to make the point clear: Ration for a low-producing cow Ration for a medium-producing ctrw fO* 4!u!

That i«, aMNumintf that on a full ration a cow ia producing 40 pornd* of milk a day, when the ration in cut down one-fourth, enough food remain* above maintenance for only about 20 pound* of milk, and a cow muat noon reduce her Row to that amount. Hince, after maintenance has been provided, the remainder of the ration la used exclusively for milk production, it ia a great mistake from the atandpoint of economy to fail to aupply to a high - producing cow a ration sufficient to allow her to continue to produce at or near her full capacity. On the other hand, a low-producing cow may be fed ao much that ahe will be getting more food than *he ia capable of utilizing for milk production, Such a cow, after producing aa much milk </seg>

In thi* case, the cow gradually lose* flesh. 8he will, however, if the ration is not increased, Anally reduce her milk flow until it corresponds to the amount of nutrients contained in her ration.

For the Make of economy, however, the ration *houldcontain an little an pOMtible of exce** proU'ln, becau«e protein feed* are usually more ex|»nftive than energy-producing feedH. A ration that i» lacking in protein When not enough protein i» wupplied in the ration, the amount of milk produced mu«t be adju»ted to the amount of protein iivmluMi- fur milk production.

It is usually u cheaper miurc* 1 of nutrient* than concentrate* and in usually grown on the farm. Town should, therefore, hav« all of thiit kind of ftwd they will consume, In most coses, they will consume enough roughage lo more than meet maintenance requirement* and will therefore have more or lew* nutrient* left to apply on milk orodudion. If the roughage In of Hut'h a nature that It balance* for milk production after maintenance is taken away, it in possible to calculate the amount of milk that can be produced from the nutrient* that remain. If the roujfhatfe i - not mo lutlanced, it. will simplify the NVHtem of feedinic and may economise the ration if enouuh of a NuifuMe concentrate i» iulded to balance the rouifhatte before fe^dinu any of the regular yrain mixture. The point in, that under practical conditionit all cowu get muuhuuv and nhould have all they will take. If the rouyhaKe in balanced in ititelf uw already utated, or in balanced by adding a concentrate, the cow will priKluce on thin feed alone a certain amount of milk. If «he In not producing more than that amount, whatever it may be, uhe doe* not require additional feed, and it would not be economy to feed her grain. If, on the other hand, •he id producing more milk than i» provided for in the roughage, nutrient* for the additional amount of milk nhould be nunplied by adding the proper amount of a grain mixture that In balanced for milk production only. To illustrate, awtuming that a HoUtein cow weighing 1,200 pounds and producing 3.5 per cent milk is consuming IS pounds of alfalfa hay and •')&amp; pounds of corn silage, how many pounds of milk will this roughage provide for (above maintenance) and how much and what kind of grain mixture should the cow have in addition?

Under summer conditions when cows are on pasture, the amount of grain fed should be regulated according to the quality of the pasture. It will usually be found economical to feed grain quite liberally to high-producing cows even when on good pasture. Silage is an excellent supplement for poor pasture, and alfalfa hay may be fed to advantage especially as the season advances. SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO MIXING AND FEEDINC CRAIN For mixing grain, select a clean, smooth surface in a con - venient place (if possible, the floor in front of the bin where the mixture is to be stored), spread the different kinds of feed out on the floor in thin layers one on top of another, covering a surface 6 to 8 feet square. Mix thoroly by turning two or three times with a scoop shovel in the same manner as material is turned in mixing concrete. When thoroly mixed, scoop into the bin. Cottonwed rru-al 150 pound* </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Extension Bulletin No. College of Agriculture 20 At feeding time the grain may be carried from the bin in a basket, tub, or box. The feed record, pasted on a cardboard and carried by the feeder, will indicate how much to feed each cow. The feeder will soon be able to remember how much each cow is to have, so that it will not be necessary for him to carry the record. Remember that the figures in the feeding table indicate totals for the day. A tin pail or a small hand scoop may be used in feeding the cows. Marks can be made on the side to indicate the weight of the grain mixture that the paij or scoop will hold up to these marks. If a feed cart or truck is available for bringing the grain from the bin, a small scale may be attached to it in some manner, and as it is pushed along in front of the cows the feed can be weighed for each one. In case such a cart is used, the concentrate required to balance the roughage can be placed in one end and the grain mixture in the other. If a feed cart is not used, the two kinds of grain can be fed from separate pails.
