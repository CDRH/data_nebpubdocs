REPORT. 

State of Nebraska, Treasury Department, ) 
Lincoln, December 1, 1902. ) 

To His Excellency, Ezra P. Sewage, Governor: 

Dear Sir: — In accordance with a provision of the Constitution 
of the state of Nebraska, I have the honor to submit the report 
of the Treasury Department for the bienninm commencing 
December 1, 1900 and ending November 29, 1902. 

Before proceeding to present the financial statement I deem it 
pertinent to make the following remarks and suggestions: 

There is now a balance of $5,074. 10 in the Normal School 
Library Fund which is not available on account of the failure of 
the last legislature to make the necessary appropriation. The 
Penitentiary Land Fund also has a balance of (4,088.00 which 
is unavailable for the same reason as the above. Under the 
provisions of the inheritance tax law passed by the last legislature 
$64.74 have been paid into the treasury, but as the law does not 
designate the fund to which this tax shall be credited it is held 
subject to the disposition of the incoming legislature. These 
matters should be brought to the attention of the legislature early 
in the session in order that they may not be overlooked or 
forgotten. 

Many inconveniences arise from the fact that the fiscal year 
commences on the first day of December instead of the day upon 
which the Treasurer assumes the duty of the office. This makes 
it accessary for each treasurer to report more than a month's business 
of his predecessor which is bunglesome and un business like. 
At the date of the biennial report as now fixed by statute the temporary 
school fund has not been apportioned and distributed thus 
rendering the grand total balance on hand unnecessarily large. 
I therefore suggeet that Section 9, Article 4, of the Compiled </seg>

            <seg id="p004">
4 


Statutes of Nebraska be repealed and that a legislative enactment 
be passed fixing the commencement of the fiscal year on the same 
date as the installation of state officials. 

The investment of the educational trust funds of the state in 
interest bearing securities is an intricate and perplexing problem 
which sh«uld receive the earnest and careful attention of the legislature 
until a wise and practical solution is obtained, if such 
solution is within the range of its power. Under present constitutional 
limitations municipal bonds and school district bonds are 
not available for purposes of investment. The recent decision of 
the Supreme Court holding that bonds of other states are available 
securities has temporarily relieved the situation, and as a 
result practically all the educational trust funds are now invested. 
This has been accomplished by my own unceasing efforts and 
the active aid of the other members of the Board of Educational 
Lands and Funds. During the biennium just closed the total 
investments amounted to $2,839,825.43, a sum more than a 
million dollars larger than was ever invested before in the same 
length of time during the whole history of the state. But notwithstanding 
these record breaking investments it has been absolutely 
impossible to keep all the trust funds invested at all times, 
and the difficulty attendant upon investments will incredfee rapidly 
in the near future unless some immediate action be taken. The 
remaining principal on school lands sold will soon be paid into 
the treasury, many bonds now held will soon be optional and 
every call of General Fund Warrants for payment returns a 
large amount to the Permanent School Fund, hence it is very 
evident that these trust funds will be largely increased in the succeeding 
biennium. What shall be done with them? This is the 
great question. A Constitutional amendment authorizing investment 
in municipal and school district bonds coupled with a provision 
for the deposit of any uninvested balance in depository 
banks wou'd at least be a partial solution of this difficult problem. 
At the present time the several trust funds hold as investments 
bonds and warrants to the amount of $5,456,977.90, which 
amount is $982,476.46 larger than ever before held by these 
funde. </seg>

            <seg id="p005">

I he floating indebtedness of the state is now $1,989,328.63, 
listing of warrants drawn on the state general fund. The 
national trust funds hold $ 1,457,351.56 of this amount and 
balance itRl6ld_by corporations and individuals. This floatdebifTias 
created by making appropriations larger tham 
amount that could be collected from the state levy upon the 
ssed valuation of property in the state. Either the assessed 
ation or the rate of taxation must be increased if this large 
: is to be paid. This subject is of vast and increasing iuiport) 
and well worthy the candid and conscientious consideration 
Lie legislature. 

I tender my sincere thanks to the officers of the other departments 
of the state government for their uniform kindness and 
courtesy, and to the employes of this department for their 
efficiency and fidelity. 

The foregoing remarks and suggestions and the following summaries 
and detailed statements are respectfully submitted. 

Wm. Stuefir, 

State Treasurer. </seg>
