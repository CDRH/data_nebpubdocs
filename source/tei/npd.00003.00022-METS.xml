            <seg id="p010">PREFACE. 

The education of this up-to-date period is almost universal. 
It includes all branches; it is extended to all peoples of all 
nations. A wave of practical knowledge during the last decade 
has brought the greatest century to a magnificent close. The 
hearthstone of the universe is being swept of its ancient superstitions 
and all about us is beginning to dawn the sunlight of the 
Twentieth Century. The advancement of the limes is shown 
by the eagerness with which the common people of all nations 
seek to satisfy their intellectual cravings. 

The tidal wave of education has already begun to set in. 
This onward march of civilization and general enlightenment 
makes it difficult to anticipate the characteristics of public school 
education, even for the first ten years of the Twentieth Century. 

If we judge the future from the past, we may expect great 
changes. If we can catch the spirit of the times in which we 
live we may venture to predict whither we are drifting. 

The educational reforms have come to the public schools 
largely through the higher institutions of learning. The secondary 
schools have received from these higher educational 
institutions a great impetus during the past few years. These 
secondary schools in turn are permeating the primary schools 
with new life and diffusing the new education of investigation, 
of research, of thought — as against the old method of cram. 

The new century education will witness less of that kind of 
mass education which leads to uniformity and crushes out individuality. 
The individual will be free; he will not be restricted 
by a narrow and slavish system of machine education. The 
child will not be expected to have his education shaped by a 
single pattern used to mould the mind. We have already ceased 
to mutilate the body; we will soon cease to mutilate the mind. 
The preciousness of individuality will be recognized. Child 
nature will be recognized as at its best when it is spontaneous. 

The rural schools will receive far greater attention, since it </seg>

will be recognized that the foundation must be better laid if 
higher education is to accomplish its aims. 

Rural school districts will be consolidated, and a graded system 
of schools will be maintained in rural districts. These schools 
will be equipped with good libraries, which will be accessible to 
the patrons, as well as to the pupils and teachers of the schools. 
The school houses will be built with all the modern conveniences, 
and will be furnished and adorned as well as the best homes. 
The grounds will be m.ide to lend a" better environment, such as 
will attract rather than repel the pupil. 

Manual training will be found a necessary factor in organic 
development. Its spirit will be found ethical and revolutionary. 

We will have a change in our present untqual method of taxation, 
which will tend to equalize the burden and give to all 
the advantages of good schools for a reasonable number of 
months each year. 

Agricultural education will be one of the promimnt features 
of the rural schools, and many of the features of the garden 
school will be employed. 

We may look for a radical change in the spelling of English 
words. We predict that our leading colleges and universities 
will forward the initiative movement of the N. E. A. in the 
spelling reform; text-books will be printed with the new spelling; 
the secondary, and finally the primary schools will adopt the 
change, and thus the whole system will be adjusted to the spelling 
reform. Humorists will not then have grounds for making 
sport of the language, which is destint d to become the language 
of all nations, bv claiming it the worst language of the globe in 
its divergence between spelling and pronunciation. 

There will be a change in our national educational head. Instead 
of an United States Commissioner of Education, the 
powers, we believe, will be greaily extended and vested in a cabinet 
officer. 

The greatest advance will be the requirement on the part of 
all who teach to make special preparations for their important 
work, by completing some thorough course of study and training. </seg>

PREFACE. 

V 

Whatever advancement is experienced by any nation or people, 
we feel certain Nebraska will come in for her share of benefits. 
At the present time we are made to feel that educators of our 
beloved State are not a whit behind those of the leading States 
of the Union in professional spirit and zeal. While there is 
a decided tendency to conserve the best, the inclination is just as 
strong to appropriate that which will better accomplish their 
high ideals. 

It is with pleasure that I speak of the cordial cooperation on 
the part of county and city Superintendents, and of the educators 
of the State in general. The uniformly courteous treatment 
always accorded me is an occasion for profound gratitude. 

The reports of Superintendents will be read with profit by 
those interested in the administration of school affairs. 

During the past four years this department has had the assistance 
of the able and faithful services of Deputy State Superintendent 
C. F. Beck. A more conscientious worker is not to be 
found. His extended experience as County and City Superintendent 
enabled him to discharge with accuracy and dispatch 
the important duties devolving upon him as deputy. He has 
rendered the State much valuable service and is highly 
esteemed by the educators of Nebraska. 

Mr, Alex Bentlev has served as an assistant in the office for 
nearly eight years, and under three different administrations. 
Although he could have retained the position, he has decided to 
enter another field of work. The educators of the State will 
appreciate finding a cut of this excellent young man in this 
report. 

Miss Jennie B. Adams will continue to be stenographer in the 
office. The preparation she has made for, and the successful 
experience she has had in educational work, especially fit her for 
this position, which she has filled with great credit to herself 
and to the Department of Education for the past four years.

QUALIFICATION OF TEACHERS. 

There has been such a wide divergence on the part of educators 
in estimating the preparation the teachers of the State 
have made, that we deemed it important to get definite data on 
this point. 

This department has for several years provided county superintendents 
with enrolling blanks, calling for such information 
on the part of all those taking the examination, as will leave a 
fair record of the preparation made for teaching. The following 
circular asking for information was sent to each county superintendent. 


OFFICE OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, Nov. 16, 1900. 
Dear County Superintendent : 

I desire to make a careful investigation of the qualifications of 
the teachers of Nebraska. It is claimed that each year one-third 
of the teachers of the State begin their first work as teachers, 
and that only a very small per cent have been educated further 
than in the common schools. 

That I may have statistics to tabulate and insert in my biennial 
on this important subject, will you please answer the following 
questions and return to me? Your Institute Enrolling blanks and 
records of the office will furnish most of the information. Please 
answer all questions accurately, if possible; but if it is impossible 
to give definite answer on any question, make a careful estimate. 

Very truly yours, 

W. R. Jackson, 

State Superintendent.

Number who have taught ten years or more. 

PREPARATION FOR TEACHING 

Number of teachers who are graduates of some college 
or university 

Number of teachers who are graduates of a normal 
school 

Number who have not completed a normal course, but 
have had high school education or the equivalent. 

Number who have received less than a three years' 
high school education 

Number teaching who have had no high schoo' training 
Signed Co. Supt Co. 

Date 1900. 

Reports were received from seventy-two counties. On com- 

piling these figures it is found there are 7,364 teachers in these 
counties, and the number required is 6,943. Thus it will appear 
that over 94 per cent of those receiving certificates are actually 

required to teach the schools. 

Number teaching their first year 1222, or 16 5% 

Number teaching their second year 1200, or 16.3% 

Number who have taught two years or more. . . . 4203, or 57% 

Number who have taught ten years or more. . . 739, or 10% 

Since the above counties represent the poorest, as well as the 

best counties, and comprise four-fifths of the counties of the 
State, we have data that may be considered quite accurate for 
the State. It appears that a much smaller per cent of our 
teachers are new recruits each year than has been generally supposed. 
We doubt whether any State has a smaller percentage 

of inexperienced teachers. 

Under the head "Preparation for Teaching," the report is not 

so satisfactory. In the case of 302 teachers there was lack of 
data; thus leaving 7062 teachers with preparation as indicated

Number of teachers who are graduates of a

course, but have had high school education

Number who have received less than a three 

years' high school education 2065, or 292% 

Number teaching who have had no high school 

training 1017, or 15% 

The above figures show that less than 16 per cent of our 

teachers have had anything like adequate professional training 
for their important work. The high school makes no attempt 

at training teachers. 

We are again constrained to say that the great problem to be 

solved is how to secure the needed supply of trained teachers 

for our schools. 

STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 

When we consider that less than 16 per cent of our teachers 
have received special training for their profession, we are made 
to feel the importance of increasing the capacity and efficiency 
of our State Normal School. The present plant has about 
feached its capacity, but with a reasonably liberal appropriation 
to provide for more recitation room, with but slight increase 
in the faculty, double the number could be accommodated. 
There is great need for a larger library building, which should 
be fire-proof. The present library building could be utilized 
for other purposes to great advantage. Never in the history of 
our State Normal has it done more efficient work than it is doing 
at present. 

Our present State Normal School at Peru should be well provided 
for before attempting to build other State normals. 

We would urgently recommend that the State Legislature 
make liberal appropriations for normal training. It other normal 
schools are provided, they should be so located as not to interfere 
with schools now doing efficient work. If the State were 
to purchase one or two of the well-equipped private normals, it 
would no doubt be wiser than to build entirely new. </seg>

COUNTY INSTITUTES. 

COUNTY INSTITUTES. 

The subject of institutes is one that interests not only superintendents 
and teachers, but patrons of schools as well. They are 
not conducted primarily for the benefit of teachers, but for the 
ultimate good that results in belter schools. 

Since the county institutes afford the only opportunity for a 
considerable number of our teachers to secure professional 
training, it is always pertinent to discuss matter and methods 
employed in conducting them. 

In order to discuss this subject from a practical standpoint, it 
is necessary to understand the conditions which exist relative to 
this subject. Investigation shows that the total enrollment in 
the schools of Nebraska for the year ending July 10, 1899, was 
2 77i769. Of this number 124,885 were enrolled in graded 
schools, leaving 152,884, or a trifle more than 55% enrolled in 
rural schools. For the same period 14,628 were enrolled in the 
high schools, and of this number 2,550 were non-residents. Deducting 
14,628 from the total enrollment, we have 263,141 as 
the number enrolled in grades below the high school. A little 
less than 95% of all pupils attending school last year were enrolled 
in the eight grades below the high school. 

These figures are significant, and should indicate, in a measure, 
the kind of work which should be done in the institutes. 
High school teachers, as a rule, do not attend institutes. This 
leaves practically the whole institute made up of teachers who 
do grade work. The ground to be covered should be comprised 
wholly within the limits of study confined to grades below 
the high school. This much with reference to matter. Now 
with reference to methods. 

The total number enrolled in institutes last year was 7,970. 
They were enrolled as teachers, but the reports do not give the 
amount of teaching done by them. 

The question which presents itself to county superintendents 
is, — W.iat kind of an institute will best serve the purpose, — </seg>

            <seg id="p031">
12 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S KEPORT. 

will best fit those attending for the practical work of the schoolroom? 
In answering this question, each superintendent must 
know the needs of his teachers. If he knows them to be fully 
equipped as to scholarship, he may with perfect propriety,, 
employ the purely lecture method. On the other hand, if his 
teachers are deficient in the first requisite of a teacher, namely, 
scholarship, and he is limited to that kind of material out of 
which to make teachers, then he may with equal propriety 
employ the purely academic method. If he chooses the latter,, 
he should select for his instructors persons who are known to be 
successful in the schoolroom. He should select these instructors 
under the same rules he lays down to his school boards. They 
should be selected with reference to their character and ability. 
Politics, religion, friendship, or relationship should have no bearing 
on the question. 

The county superintendent of each county, as a rule, plans tohave 
a teacher's institute to be held in his county for a period 
varying from one to four weeks, the average length of institute 
being a little less than two weeks for each county. We recommend 
that teachers' examinations be held, as far as practicable, 
immediately before the institute, so that teachers may give more 
of their attention to methods. In this way, proper recognition 
can be given for institute work and the result of the examination 
can be announced at the close of the institute session. We 
find this works very satisfactory. 

Many of our counties have shortened the period of institute 
from two or three weeks to one week, and instead of making 
the institute the means of cramming for examination, they have 
secured the best talent. available and have sought to place before 
the teachers high ideals, to inspire them with a desire for growth, 
to elevate the professional standard, to quicken and energize the 
professional spirit, and to improve the organization, the instruction 
and the management of schools, in short, to teach teachers 
how to teach and how to train. 

I am convinced that one of the most potent factors in improving 
the condition of our schools lies in the teachers receiving suitable 
training for their work, especially along pedagogical lines. </seg>

ASSOCIATIONS. 

ASSOCIATIONS. 

Nebraska had a larger per cent of her educators in attendance 
at the National Meeting of the Department of Superintendence 
at its last session than any other State west of the Missouri 
river. If there is anything good within sight or hearing, depend 
on Nebraska getting some of the benefits! 

The attendance at the National Educational Association by 
Nebraska teachers has been quite gratifying. But the most encouraging 
feature is the unusually large attendance upon our 
State and district associations. The wide-awake teacher finds 
it necessary to come in contact with those engaged in the same 
kind of work. The exchange of ideas and the professional 
spirit received at these gatherings give the teachers new zest in 
their work. 

In this age of organization and association, the teacher who 
does not avail himself of their benefits must soon drop out of the 
ranks and give place to a more progressive educator. 

STATE TEACHERS' READING CIRCLE. 

It is a source of much satisfaction to note the manifest revival 
of interest in the Teachers' Reading Circle work in Nebraska. 
There is appreciation of its great value as supplying a need 
which cannot be met in any other way. A few years ago the 
Reading Circle work was on the decline, largely, perhaps, because 
of the selection of the line of work; but the methods pursued 
in forwarding the work seemed not effective. For the last 
two years there has been a steady and healthful growth. 

County superintendents recognize that the teacher who does 
not read cannot keep in touch with the educational spirit of the 
age. The teacher, to do justice to the young minds she would 
seek to build up and to train for a beautiful and successful life, 
must do something for her own professional advancement. "No 
teacher is truly progressive, no teacher is doing the best possible 
work, who is not constantly learning from the experience and </seg>

            <seg id="p033">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

the thoughts of others. A few wisely selected books treating of 
the general departments of educational science, and a well-edited 
journal discussing the current questions of the educational world, 
are essential auxiliaries to the best classroom discipline and instruction. 
The principal or superintendent who neglects to urge 
upon his teachers the importance of professional reading and 
study, neglects his best single means of advancing the efficiency 
of his schools. The true aim of Teachers' Reading Circles is to 
aid in making better practical teachers by securing to them broad 
and right views of the purpose and method of educational work." 
Too few of our teachers are doing a sufficient amount of systematic 
reading along the line of their profession; too few have even 
the beginning of a professional library. A carpenter could not 
be expected to construct a beautiful dwelling with no plans or 
specifications to model from other than those he might improvise 
upon the spur of the moment. He needs more than a saw and 
hammer. Should he be resourceful enough to draw all his plans 
without the aid of the usual helps, the buildings thus constructed 
must necessarily be of a type devoid of the variety, beauty and 
elegance that come from studying the plans of master mechanics. 
That Nebraska now ranks well with other States in the reading 
circle movement is indicated by the following statement in letters 
I have received from Hon. H. M. Skinner who was one of the 
first, if not the first in the movement of reading circle work in the 
United States. 

Looking over the output of our Reading Circle books in Nebraska 
now at the close of the Institute season, I am glad to find, 
in the showing, much encouragement. Nebraska seems to be 
second now to Iowa of the States of the West, exclusive of In r 
diana. Of course the showing is not what it should be, but it is 
gratifying in view of the recent depression of Reading Circle interests.

counties being represented." 

From another letter bearing date of December 15, 1900, I 
quote: "It is exceedingly gratifying to be able to report at this 
time that the work is actually done in 60 counties, thus more 
than two-thirds of the counties are now engaged in it ; and those 
in which its claims are disregarded are not only in the minority 
but also in unfavorable contrast with those in which the work is 
pursued so generally throughout the State. To tell the truth I 
was fearful that we might not even reach the half-way mark; but 
having passed the two-'.hirds mark I feel very hopeful for the 
future and I feel also the debt of gratitude which is owing to you 
for the efficient manner in which you have conducted the work. 
If all State Superintendents wor 1 do this there would never be 
a question in the world as to the future of the Reading Circle.'* 

In view of the fact that the State Superintendent is in a position 
to forward the Reading Circle work as no other one can, it 
seems especially appropriate that he should be Reading Circle 
Manager. This will entail no expense sending out circular matter 
since it can be sent with other shipments from the office.. 
And beside there is more interest taken in the work if properly 
pushed by the State Department. The satisfactory results of the 
past year would seem to warrant a continuation of this policy. 
The Teachers' Reading Circle has become an integral part of 
the State educational system. Years of experience have attested 
its value, and at the same time have indicated the conditions 
under which it may be made most efficient. In the first place,, 
the Reading Circle is for all -public school teachers, of whatever 
age or experience, and of whatever grade of professional and 
personal culture. </seg>

THB PUPILS* READING CIRCLE. 

The Pupils' Reading Circle has made a healthful growth in 
the past two years and is a potent factor in bringing to the pupils 
a line of wholesome reading that stimulates a taste for the best 
literature. In many of our schools the pupils' reading circle has 
formed the foundation of a growing library. 

Special effort has been made in the last few years to create a 
sentiment in favor of libraries in our schools. Nebraska is perhaps 
the first to put out a library program. We are gratified 
with the results. Other States have followed Nebraska's example 
and are putting out special programs. We would recommend 
that every school have a library and that special pains be taken 
in the selection of the books and in the care of the same. The 
traveling library is also worthy of consideration, especially in 
the smaller towns where there are no public libraries. 

teachers' libraries. 

In many of our cities and in a number of our counties are to 
be found pedagogical libraries. Wherever these have been properly 
managed they have been a powerful agent in the upbuilding 
of the teachers. Not only are the teachers benefited, but the 
children under their charge are reaping the results. The teachers 
who make use of these county teachers' libraries are not content 
until the schools they teach are provided with good working 
libraries. In a number of counties almost every district has a 
library. The habit of reading good books is reaching the homes 
and the parents are being benefited as much as the children. 
Thus the teachers' pedagogical library in the county is a means 
of awakening an interest that is widespread in its effects. We 
hope the time is not distant when there shall be a teacher's 
library in every county and a good working library in every 
school. The library can do for the student what no school can 
do. It can furnish the opportunity for that fuller and richer 
study in any one branch of science in which the student has 
become deeply interested. </seg>

SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS. 

SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS. 

One of the most essential requisites for successful teaching 
is a good school building. This fact is being recognized more 
fully every year, and as the wealth of the country increases we 
may expect better school buildings. 

A very large number of our cities and towns have, during the 
past four years, built and equipped some of as fine school buildings 
as one could desire. Not only are they pleasing to the eye, 
but they are built on modern plans, and are constructed with 
special reference to principles of sanitation — heating, lighting 
and ventilation receiving full consideration. 

Insufficient means and the lack of a knowledge of what constitutes 
a properly built schoolhouse, account for the thousands 
of "box car" buildings dotting the hills and valleys of Nebraska. 
"Economy" is written everywhere, but what was intended for 
economy is proving, in many cases, to be extravagance, principally 
along the lines of health and comfort of the pupils who are 
compelled to occupy them. 

We present herewith a cut of a modern school building, and 
commend it to the careful consideration of school officers, who 
contemplate building. Not only is it arranged with reference to 
the convenience and comfort of the pupils, but the matter of 
health is wisely taken into consideration. If this were all, it 
would be a great improvement over the too common style of 
buildings, but there is another feature that strongly recommends 
it — and that is its external appearance. There is something 
about the building that appeals to the pride of the boys and 
girls. It appeals to their better natures, and cultivates and 
develops the aesthetic feelings. 

If more attention were given to these features when building 
schoolhouses, I believe it would result in a better attendance 
and in a better school sentiment. 

A word might be added with profit in connection with this

STATE SUPERINTENDENT S REPORT. 

phase of school economy, with reference to the school grounds. 
I do not need to picture the surroundings of most country 
schools; they are of too common occurrence to need mention, 
and while much has been said and written on the subject of 
school grounds, it is a lamentable fact that three out of four, 
¦take the country over, show a great deal of neglect and indifference. 
Teachers throughout the State have been reasonably 
faithful in the matter of observing Arbor Day, and have added 
considerable interest towards beautifying the grounds, but their 
efforts, if not followed up by successors, and by school boards, 
usually prove of transient value. 

It is to be hoped that not only may teachers continue the 
demand for better and prettier school buildings and grounds, but 
that the patrons and school boards may be awakened to the 
necessities of the case, and begin at once to plan for buildings in 
keeping with the progress of the age. 

During the past year an illustrated pamphlet entitled "Better 
School Houses" was placed in the hands of each county superintendent, 
with the suggestion that its contents be brought 10 
the attention of school boards who contemplate building. By 
this means, by calling attention to the matter in public addresses, 
and by written articles have we endeavored to arouse an interest 
in the matter, and we feel that our efforts have not been entirely 
in vain. </seg>

COURSE OF STUDY. 

COURSE OF STUDY. 

There is no doubt but that the splendid results achieved in 
our rural schools is due, in great measure, to the helpful influence 
of our State Course of Study. This is in the hands of 
all teachers, and is being followed as closely as the conditions in 
each district will permit. As a result, the pupils of our rural 
schools are being instructed in a systematic, progressive manner, 
and all agree that the Course is very helpful, especially so to 
young teachers. 

Several editions of the present Course have been issued. It is 
deemed expedient to revise the Course to some extent, and add 
new material. I would recommend that a chapter or division 
on the subject of "Elements of Agriculture" be added, and I 
believe a chapter on " Morals and Manners " would add to 
the value of the book; not that teachers overlook this very 
important subject, but many teachers do not have the facilities for 
furnishing needed material, which they would highly appreciate 
if prepared and furnished, and which would be neglected in 
many instances if not so prepared and furnished. Outlines of 
civil government should be added to the Course, to be used in 
general lessons, if no regular time can be allotted to its study. </seg>

APPORTIONMENT OF SCHOOL FUNDS. 

It is a source of gratification and pride that we are enabled to 
report the distribution of $2,804,251.81 during the past four 
years, among the several school districts of the State. This is 
the greatest amount that has ever been appropriated during a 
like period of time, and reflects great credit upon the state 
officials who have had the management of the school lands and 
funds. 

The permanent school fund is made up as follows, and the 
annual interest or income only can be appropriated. — (Sec. 3, 
Art. VIII, Constitution of Nebraska.) 

First. — Such per centum as has been or may hereafter be 
granted by Congress on the sale of lands in this State. 

Second. — All moneys arising from the sale or leasing of sections 
number sixteen and thirty -six in each township in this 
State, and the lands selected or that may be selected in lieu 
thereof. 

Third. — The proceeds of all lands that have been or may 
hereafler be granted to this State, where, by the terms and conditions 
of such grant, the same are not to be otherwise appropriated. 


Fourth. — The net proceeds of lands and other property and 
effects that may come to the State, by escheat or forfeiture, or 
from unclaimed dividends, or distributive shares of the estates of 
deceased persons. 

"Jifth. — All moneys, stocks, bonds, lands, and other property 
now belonging to the common school fund. 

The temporary school fund is made up of: 

(Sec. 4.) — "All other grants, gifts, and devises that have been 
or may hereafter be made to this State, and not otherwise 
appropriated by the terms of the grant, gift or devise, the interest 
arising from all the funds mentioned in the preceding section, </seg>

            <seg id="p042">

APPORTIONMENT OF SCHOOL FUNDS. 

together with all the rents of the unsold school lands, and such 
other means as the Legislature may provide, shall be exclusively 
applied to the support and maintenance of common schools in 
each school district in the State. 

(Sec. 5.) — All fines, penalties, and license moneys arising 
under the general laws of the State shall belong and be paid 
over to the counties respectively where the same may be levied 
or imposed, and all fines, penalties, and license moneys arising 
under the rules, by-laws, or ordinances of cities, villages, towns, 
precincts, or other municipal subdivisions less than a county, shall 
belong and be paid over to the same respectively. All such 
fines, pe nalties, and license moneys shall be appropriated exclusively 
to the use and support of common schools in the respective 
subdivisions where the same may accrue." 

The framers of our Constitution builded wisely in thus providing 
posterity with the means for furnishing an education. 

It is estimated that when the final payments shall have been 
made for school lands now under contract of sale, about 
$8,000,000 will be in the permanent school fund. This sum 
must forever remain inviolate and undiminished, and with a wise 
and judicious investment thereof, together with the annual rents 
due from the lease of school lands, the semi-annual apportionments 
in future years will be no small factor in maintaining our 

schoo 

SALARIES. 

One of the economic questions involved in maintaining schools 

is that of teachers' salaries. Salaries range from $20 per month 
for teachers in rural schools, to $3,600 per year for city superintendents, 
but few receiving the former sum, and only one 
receiving the last mentioned amount. During the last two years 
the average salary has increased somewhat, but is yet far below 
what it should be. Salaries should be more equitable. Lady 
teachers who possess the necessary qualifications and perform 
the same labor as men, should receive the same compensation. 
As a matter of fact, they do not, except in rare instances. 

About two and one-half millions of dollars are expended yearly 
for salaries of teachers. </seg>

PATRONS 1 MEETINGS. 

It is a source of gratification to note the general interest taken 
in school affairs by the public. Formerly school questions and 
nearly all questions pertaining to children, were left to the 
teacher. Of late years there is a growing sentiment that parents 
and the general public have a very great interest in the welfare 
of the young, and in consequence public and private meetings 
are held in many sections to discuss matters pertaining to the 
children. 

Mothers' meetings are held and questions are discussed which 
can but result in much good. Child study societies are organized 
for the purpose of research and investigation. The results from 
these investigations must be far-reaching in their effects. 

Patrons.' meetings are becoming popular. These are held 
once or twice during the month, in some of our schools, and all 
interested are urged to be present and participate in the proceedings. 
Usually a program is arranged consisting of an 
address by some popular educator, followed by discussions by 
patrons and teachers. The program is generally interspersed 
with music, and frequently light refreshments are served. These 
meetings have a two-fold object, viz: To interest the patrons 
in the schools, and to foster the social feeling in the community. </seg>

DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

DOMESTIC SCIENCE* 

Although the study of domestic science in all its branches has 
been going on in a great many schools for the past fifteen years, 
the full importance of this line of study has only began to be appreciated 
by the outside world. That cookery has scientific 
aspects is a new idea to most people: that whether we make pie, 
doughnuts, pork and white bread a part of our diet or not, could 
make any difference in our mental ability and amount of energy 
and force, inspires only incredulity. 

Too little attention has been paid to the proper nourishment of 
our bodies, and 100 much to the cramming of all the knowledge 
we could absorb. 

With this new era of education the child will be taught to use 
his hands more, and thus in making his brain work in cooperation 
with his hands, have a better development of mind and 
body. This is being done in the new manual training courses, 
which include carpentry and kindred industries for the boys and 

&gt;okery, housework and sewing for the girls. 

The principles of housewifery are being made such an art, 
that they cannot fail to appeal to every girl. What is more important 
than that the child learns the quality and money value of 
food and household equipments early, as the future homes depend 
upon the education of the schoolgirl. 

At this present day the cry all over the country is of the incompetency 
of servants. The housewife is at the mercy of her 
help, and knows not how to instruct the inefficient. When the 
happiness of so many people depends upon the skilful and harmonious 
management of a house, is it not fitting that the young 
girl should be prepared in some respect for the best fulfilling of 
those duties which she should be proud to be accomplished in? 

Note. — Contributed for this report by Miss Herbert* Jaynes, of Omaha. 
She was selected by the State Department of Education to represent Nebraska 
in Oread Institute, Worcester, Mass., where she has been making 
special study of domestic science. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT S REPORT. 

It must be evident to every one, of the need for more 
knowledge and practice along these lines. 

The number of schools which have included a course in this 
sort of work shows that. Schools, colleges and institutions are 
taking up this study, and following it with enthusiasm. A 
formal study of matters pertaining to home life is carried on in 
the elementary schools of about fifty cities. Private institutions 
are springing up and clubs and societies are being formed to 
to make a more thorough study of this subject. 

In 1894 the Massachusetts legislature decreed that every city 
of 20,000 inhabitants or more, should maintain a manual training 
course as part of the high school corriculum, with cookery and 
household science for the girls. 

The course in cookery, in connection with the theory and 
practice of cookery, treats of house sanitation, personal hygiene, 
feeding of infants, marketing, planning and serving of meals and 
the nutritive value and digestibilitv of foods. 

This study is not to the end that the homes of any one class 
may be bettered but that the standard of living and life may be 
raised in all homes, in the belief that this will make far better

SPECIAL DAYS IN THE SCHOOLS. 

SPECIAL DAYS IN THE SCHOOLS. 

Special days have been observed throughout the State and 
much practical good has already resulted. The ultimate good 
can only be estimated. Like 'bread cast upon the waters,' the 
good results from the observance of these days may only be 
known bv the returns after many days or years. Lessons of 
love, patience, patriotism and other virtues are taught and learned 
by this plan, that might be untaught or unlearned if these special 
programs were not prepared. For instance, our Bird and Arbor 
Day Manual teaches, in an impressive way, lessons with reference 
to the care and protection of trees; the uses, care and protection 
of our birds. This subject of birds is becoming of so 
vital importance that committees are being formed in various 
parts of the State, having for their object the protection of our 
native birds. It is claimed that if the present rate of destruction 
is continued, it is only a question of a few years before some 
species of our birds will be exterminated, and dire results will 
follow in the destruction of the farmers' crops by various insects. 
If every school-boy and school-girl can be taught to place a 
proper value upon birds, not only for the pleasure they give in 
beauty and song, but in their great economic value to the interests 
of all our people, we need have no fear as to the future of 
the birds. If the subject is neglected, drastic measures will be 
necessary by legislation. It is cheaper to educate the young 
than to provide for an army of officers to prosecute offenders. If 
every boy and girl were to provide a suitable place for birds to 
build their nests, instead of doing as many do — destroy them, — 
birds would become more numerous and their beneficial results 
would follow in proportion to the increase. 

This may be done in a variety of ways; for instance, cocoanut 
shells could be suspended in trees, gourds can be utilized in the 
same manner. Children can be taught to make bird houses. The 
ingenuity of the boys can be brought into play to make the nests, </seg>

not only comfortable for the birds, but pleasing to the eye of all. 
In view of the importance of the subject, I most heartily recommend 
that there be set apart for the special observance, a day to 
be known as Bird Day, and that the Superintendent of Public 
Instruction be authorized and required to prepare a program 
suitable for the occasion. </seg>

OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

The opinion of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
upon disputed points of the Statute pertaining to school administration, 
is binding in the absence of any court decision. It is 
gratifying to state that during the past four years, while hundreds 
of official opinions have been given by the State Department of 
Education, we are not aware of an instance of reversal in the 
higher courts. 

Of these official deci&gt;ions the one with reference to Bible reading 
in the public schools is deemed of such general interest that 
we give space to it. Both the decision and the case in the district 
court were matters of general comment in the press 
throughout the United States. Scores of letters were received 
commenting upon the decision. Following the opinion are two 
or three of these letters: 

BIBLE READING IN PUBLIC SCHOOL 

Lincoln, Neb., Nov. 25, 1809. 

Mr. H. D. Ode//, Director, Beatrice, Neb., 

Dear Sir. — I am in receipt of your letter of the 23d inst., in 
which you set forth that a mandamus suit has been instituted against 
the school board of district No. 21 of Gage county to compel said 
board to stop the reading of the Bible or singing religious songs. 

In setting forth the conditions and facts in the case, you show 
that the plaintiff has heretofore succeeded in stopping the reading 
of the Bible, and by so doing has caused several good teachers 
to refrain from applying for your school. You state that 
nearly all in the district are in favor of allowing the teacher the 
privilege of having her opening exercises, and that you find no 
one opposed to it outside of the family of the plaintiff. The exercises 
you say consist merely of the teacher's reading from the 
Bible and repeating the Lord's Prayer, and in a few instances of 
having singing from the Gospel or Pentacostal Hymns and offer- </seg>

ing a prayer of her own composition. You inquire, "Am I (considering 
the above facts) using good judgment as a member of 
the school board in refusing to interfere with the teacher's open- 

;" 

ing exercises f 

I desire to say in reply that in a district where the sentiment is 

unanimously in favor of devotional exercises, such as reading a 

chapter from the Bible and repeating the Lord's Prayer, there 

can be no question as to the right and propriety of such exer- 

cises, especially when the reading of the Bible is without any 

comment. I do not mean to say lhat it would be proper to re- 

quire pupils to conform to any religious rite or observance, or to 

go through with any religious forms or observances inconsistent 

or contrary to their religious convictions or conscientious scruples 

Such a requisition would be a violation of the spirit of the clause 

in the Constitution which prohibits sectarian instruction. 

The word "sectarian," as defined by Webster, is "pertaining 

to a sect, or to sects; peculiar to a sect; bigotedlv attached to the 

tenets and interests of a denomination; as sectarian principle 

prejudices." 

Whether or not any particular kind of religious service at the 

opening of school work would constitute sectariar 

would depend upon the character of the exercises, and would bt 

a question of fact to be determined in each individual case. As, 

for instance, a prayer might be so offered 

3e sectarian, 

it is not necessarily so, and in general is not. The same may be 

said of the singing. 

The Bible surely cannot be considered as falling w 

he 

category of sectarian books. Indeed, the Bible is the rarest and 

richest book in the department of thought and imagination which 

exists. In its poetry, its history, its oratory, and its logic, it rises 

into the solitude of matchless pre-eminence. It is a library in 

itself. It has been the inspiration of more literature than any 

ten-thousand other books put together. The vitality of Shake- 

speare comes from the moral convictions of the Bible. It may be 

pitted against all the books of all the libraries, out of all races 

and out of all ages, and on all the subjects it proposes to handle, </seg>

and in all the lines of literature it touches it will discount them 
all many fold. 

Shall pupils be deprived of hearing read in our schools the 
book which is the greatest classic of our literature, the book 
which touches and crowns all other branches of knowledge, and 
is the most widely studied book in the world to-day? If we were 
to take the Bible quotations, direct and indirect, from our literature 
and our laws, we would divest them from nearly all that is 
high and noble. There is no other book so calculated to impress 
on the minds of children and youth the principles of piety and 
justice and the sacred regard for truth. 

There seems to be nothing in the laws of Nebraska that would 
prevent the simple reading of the Bible in our public schools. 
Judge H. M. Edwards of Scranton, Pa., has decided that 
there is nothing in the laws of Pennsylvania to prevent the 
reading of the Bible in the public schools. He says: "The 
reading of the Bible in the public schools may be allowed, 
and even commended, from a standpoint which does not involve 
the question of sectarian instruction nor the rights of conscience. 
It is conceded by men of all creeds that the Bible 
teaches the highest morality apart from religious instruction. It 
must, be admitted that sound morality is one of the foundations 
of good character. An education which dees not involve the inculcation 
of moral principles is incomplete. And why cannot the 
common precepts of morality be taught by the reading of the 
Bible better than in any other way? Furthermore, there is much 

n the Bible which cannot justly be characterized as sectarian, 
rhere can be no valid objection to the use of such matter in 

secular instruction of the pupils. Much of it has great historical 
and literary value, which may be utilized without violating the 
constitutional prohibition. It may also be used to inculcate good 
morals — that is, our duties to each other — which may and ought 

to be inculcated by the district schools. No more complete code 
of morals exists than is contained in the New Testament which 
reaffirms and emphasizes the moral obligations." 

Section 4, Article 1, of the Constitution of Nebraska, recognizes 
"religion, morality and knowledge" as "being essential to </seg>

good government." I am, therefore, of the opinion that in this 
enlightened age and Christian land the public school teacher 
ought not to be deprived of reading, without written or oral comment, 
the Bible or of repeating the Lord's Prayer. 

Very respectfully, 

W. R. Jackson, 

State Superintendent. 

Hon. W. R. "Jackson, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. 

Dear Sir. — I read your communication to Mr. Odell on the 
subject of reading the Bible in the public schools soon after it was 
written, and I then thought and still think that your views were 
right. The meaning of the word "Bible" is book. It is The Book. 
It has come down to us through the centuries and is the great 
classic of the ages. It gives us an intelligent account of the 
origin of the world and the race as the work of a Great and 
Benevolent Creator, and states our duties to him and to each 
other. A large part of the Old Testament is devoted to the 
origin, government and proceedings of the Jewish nation. Many 
of the grandest characters in history are here recorded. The 
New Testament shows the birth, life, teachings and cruel death 
of Christ. The time and place of his birth had been predicted 
by the prophets of the Bible centuries before, and the literal fulfillment 
of those and other predictions proves the truth and absolute 
reliability of the various Bible prophets. Christ came among 
the poor. He labored like other poor men until he began his 
ministry. His ministry embraced kindness to every form of 
humanity that needed help. He taught love to all, and unselfishness, 
to do good to all, even our enemies, as we have opportunity. 
If his teachings and example were followed by all, this earth 
would be a paradise. He condemned bigamy and polygamy, 
and these crimes against humanity are made felonies in every 
Christian land. The effect has been to raise woman from the 
position of a semi-slave to be the equal of her husband. Who can 
estimate the benefit to the world of the provision? It carries 
blessings to every home in the land. In history, poetry, prophecy,

rhetoric and moral teachings the Bible stands without a peer. It 
teaches the highest morality, the most tender regard for the poor,, 
the unfortunate and helpless, and condemns avarice, covetousness, 
greed and extortion. It presents the character of God as a 
kind, benevolent Being who desires the welfare and happiness of 
all, and holds out inducements for compliance with his will. 

Too little attention is given to the reading of the Bible, and 
there is a great deal of ignorance as to its contents. I believe its 
general use in the public schools would be attended with the 
most beneficial results. There is good reason to believe that 
Shakespeare, that great master, borrowed very many of his apt 
sayings and illustrations from the Bible. Free government rests 
upon the teachings of the Bible. It is the ground work of the 
leading principles of our Declaration of Independence and is 
woven into the warp and woof of our laws and homes. A book 
that thus teaches us our duty to our Creator, to ourselves and to 
society and is so interwoven into our daily life and dealings, 
should be in the hands of every student in the land.

SUNDAY SCHOOL A FACTOR IN EDUCATION. 

THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AS A FACTOR IN 
EDUCATION. 

As we look out over the broad expanse of the beautiful land 
of our State and see the institutions of learning, from our 
country schools up to our colleges, dotting our prairies and 
furnishing free education to all, we are made to rejoice. The 
desire for intellectual attainments was never so great, nor were 
the means of its gratification ever so abundant as at the present 
time. This is an age of intellectual triumph. 

A lamentable defect, however, in our otherwise admirable 
¦educational system, is the practical ignoring of religious culture. 
Nor is it possible in the public schools to give adequately this 
religious culture. The separation of Church and State is a fundamental 
principle in American civilization. But an education 
furnishing culturfc merely in the sciences and the arts falls far 
short of the true end. The final requisite of a symmetrical 
manhood is Christian character. Force and culture, strength 
and beauty will fail of their highest realization if a worthy 
motive is lacking. It is heart culture, integrity and moral 
uprightness — in short, spiritual uplift, or the reaching out of the 
soul toward God — that makes true manhood. Religious culture 
is not merely a means to an end, but a good in itself to be pur- 

led for itself. 

The lamented Arnold held that all the scholarship man ever 
had was infinitely worthless in comparison with even a very 
humble degree of spiritual advancement. The three ends at 
which he aimed, in the order of their relative importance, were, 
first and foremost, to inculate religious and moral principle, then 
courtesy of manners, and lastly, intellectual ability. 

It is a sad commentary on former methods that the word 
"sectarian" should ever be quoted as forbidding Bible reading, 
or even Bible study in our public schools. Bible readings cannot 
be omitted from the exercises of the school without a grave loss. </seg>

            <seg id="p055">
34 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Without a knowledge of the leading ideas of the Bible the pupil 
cannot even understand and appreciate the best literature of the 
English tongue. 

It is not the mission of the public school to teach the creed 
or the doctrine of any religious denomination; that is the 
province of the home, the church, and the Sabbath school. 

Here let me say that the Sabbath school is an educational 
factor that is deserving of more attention. The century upon 
which we are entering will be distinctly a Sunday school era. 
Never before has the work of the Sunday schools been so progressive, 
and its importance so fully emphasized. 

As an organization it is essentially educational. The modern 
facilities in operation in the Sunday school are an important 
factor in its unparalleled advancement. It is seeking to be 
abreast of the demands of the age. There are counted among 
its teachers many of the most brilliant minds of our land. In 
many Sunday schools are to be found an excellent corps of 
trained teachers — graduates of normal courses, and otherwise 
made efficient through the medium of the teachers' meeting, 
and teachers' union. 

As an educational factor, which must largely help to supply 
the deficiency of our public schools in furnishing religious culture, 
the Sunday school can scarcely be overestimated. There 
are three times as many teachers instructing in Sunday schools 
as are employed in our secular schools. But a small per cent 
of these, however, have made the requisite preparation for the 
work to achieve the best results. 

The great need of the Sunday school is qualified teachers — 
teachers who possess the qualities of heart and mind; who have 
a knowledge of the methods to be employed and the results to 
be attained. 

As in the public schools, so in the Sunday schools, normal 
training will count for much in bringing them to a higher 
standard of efficiency. </seg>

THE CHAUTACQUA. 

THE CHAUTAUQUA. 

We maintain our public schools to provide a great conservative 
force, to provide, as it were, a reservoir of intelligent 
citizens. Many are not permitted to have advantages of the 
public schools but for a very limited time, and would be poorly 
equipped for the realities of life if they were to rely upon the 
knowledge and discipline received in the public schools. Indeed, 
a vast majority of those who have become distinguished as men 
and women of broad and cultured minds, have become so because 
of efforts put forth outside the halls of learning. They have 
availed themselves of the choice literature to be found in the 
private and public libraries. It is safe to say that three-fourths 
of the population of our country are out of the schools. If the 
proper home environment of the youth of our land is an important 
factor conducive to their education, it is important that we 
cherish all influences which tend to the production of the very 
highest type of intelligence in the home. 

One of the most potent factors in the dissemination of a higher 
class of scholarship and culture in the humble home as well as 
among the professional men and women of to-day, is that known 
as the Chautauqua. Not only does it put in the hands of 
thousands of people a class of superior and elevating literature 
which is read, studied and then discussed in the "circle," but the 
great "Assemblies" bring to the masses the best that is to be 
found in the pulpit or upon the lecture platform. These are 
great centers of learning and inspiration. The Chautauqua is 
thus year by year becoming more helpful to the public school 
system in the dissemination of knowledge — it furnishes that 
moral culture that lifts up and fits for intelligent citizenship. 
The Chautauqua is doing a great work for education, and is 
destined to be a greater factor in the enlightening and elevating 
of mankind. 

CURFEW ORDINANCE. 

The Curfew Ordinance is one of the most important municipal 
reform movement socially and morally among our youth. It 
is in full force in some of our cities and towns and has resulted in </seg>

            <seg id="p057">
36 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

a great decrease in crimes and arrests. Teachers in public 
schools where the ordinance is in force report great improvement 
in the regularity and punctuality; the pupils are mentally 
refreshed and able to accomplish more in their studies. 

We would recommend that superintendents, teachers, and 
school officers, in the interest of our youth and better schools, 
petition the municipal authorities to enact and enforce the curfew 
ordinance. 

"The following is a partial summary of what the Curfew 
Ordinance will do for the unprotected youths of the country : 

First — It is absolutely free from any political and denominational 
feature. 

Second — It costs nothing to enforce it. 

Third — It improves parents and children morally and socially, 
builds up homes, and increases the attendance in churches, Sabbath-schools, 
and day-schools, and is a complete remedy against 
truancy in the public schools. 

Fourth — It lessens commitments to the station-house, jails, and 
reform schools in cities where enforced, 50 per cent. 

Fifth — It will lessen convicts in the penitentiary in 

ame 

proportion and protect the trades of honest mechanics 

Sixth — Police officials say it will save thousands of bovs from 

becoming tramps and rescue a multitude of youn 

from 

lives of shame. 

Seventh — The Curfew prevents accidents and fatalities to 
youths who wilfully board street-cars after night. 

Eighth — Cities with Curfew have no bands of bov robber 

Ninth — (Superintendents of reform schools certify that the 
Curfew, if honestly enforced, will prevent commitments to their 
schools." 

NEW SCHOOL LAW 

The State Legislature enacted several important laws in 1899. 
Of these, the following seem worthy of special mention :

of any county for the maintenance of free high schools for non- </seg>

resident pupils, among the schools which maintained such high 
schools. 

House Roll No. 50. — An Act to amend section 8, subdivision 
14 of chapter 79, fixing the first Monday in May as the 
time members elected on city Boards shall begin their term of 
office, and several minor changes. 

Senate File No. 131. — An Act amending four different 
sections, providing that all electors, in cities where registration 
of voters is required, shall comply with the provisions of such 
registration law before they shall be entitled to vote upon school 
matters. Several other important changes were made by this 
enactment. 

House Roll No. 363. — An Act to require all persons between 
the ages of eight and fourteen to attend some public, private or 
parochial school, and to provide penalties for the violation of the 
provisions of this compulsory education law. 

Senate File No. 8. — An Act to require school district 
boards to provide and keep in good repair at least two separate 
water closets or privies, located on those portions of the site 
farthest from the m.iin entrance to the schoolhouse, and as far 
from each other as the surrounding conditions will permit ; the 
foregoing provisions not to apply where adequate and separate 
interior closets are provided and maintained. 

House Roll No. 240. — An Act providing for the School 
Board of metropolitan cities to decide the number of mills tax on 
the dollar for the support of schools, erecting and furnishing of 
school buildings, payment of interest on bonds fur school purposes, 
etc. 

House Roll Mo. 189 — An Act to amend certain sections 
relating to school district taxes, fixing a limit in districts having 
few children, thus checking extravagance or needless expenditure 
of money. 

House Roll No. 68. — An Act to limit and regulate the 
employment of children, in manufacturing, mechanical and mercantile 
establishments, and to provide a penalty for its violation. 
The law also requires the owner, superintendent or overseer of 
such establishments to keep on file, open to the inspection of the </seg>

public, certificates signed by the president and secretary of the 
School Board, which shall state, in case the child is under fourteen 
years of age, the amount of his school attendance during 
the year preceding his employment. 

The penalty for the violation of this Act is a fine of not less 
than twenty dollars nor more than fifty dollars. 

Senate File No. 189. — An Act rela 1 ing to school lands which 
provides that owners of sale contracts may pay all or part of 
their principal and at the same time settle the interest account on 
a basis fair alike to themselves and the State. 

It provides a manner for listing for taxation all of the educational 
lands which have been deeded and which may hereafter 
be deeded. 

It provides for leasing the unleased lands at what they are 
worth to the lessee, and permits reappraising the lands now 
under lease on which the appraisal is excessive. 

Holders of lease contracts are given the opportunity, at the 
expiration of said leases, to renew the same without competition. 

Senate File No. 41. — An Act to provide free attendance at 
public high schools of non-resident pupils; to provide for the 
expense thereof and to amend section 3 of subdivision 6, sections 
2 and 7 of subdivision 14, and 2 of subdivision 17, chapter 79&gt; 
Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1897. 

In High School District No. 137 of Havelock, Nebraska, 
County of Lancaster, in an opinion prepared by Judge Norval, 
this was declared unconstitutional. Briefly stated, the grounds 
of this decision are as follows: 

The law provided for the attendance of persons of school 
age at any high school in the countv where such persons resided 
outside the limits of any high school district. The tuition for 
such attendance at the rate of seventy-five cents per week was 
required to be paid the high school district by the county. It 
was held in the opinion referred to that if seventy-five cents per 
week was in excess of fair compensation, it was on the one hand 
favorable to the high school district, and on the other hand in 
the same degree was unfair to the remainder of the county. If 
conditions were reversed and seventy-five cents was insufficient, </seg>

            <seg id="p060">
39 

NEW SCHOOL LAWS 

the county profited and the high school district was discriminated 
against. It was assumed that the rate indicated must 
necessarily be unequal and an unfair discrimination, one way or 
the other, and that therefore the law was unconstitutional 
because in contravention of sections i, 4 and 6 of article 9 of the 
Constitution of Nebraska. These sections, for the purposes of 
the case, were epitomized in the following paragraph of the 
syllabus prepared by Judge Norval. "The Constitution of this 
State requires not only that the valuation of property for taxation, 
but the rate as well, shall be uniform." 

It would seem in the face of the foregoing that it will be practically 
impossible to frame a law that will be constitutional, 
unless along an entirely different line. 

We hope that no young man or young lady will feel that a 
high school education, or even a more advanced education, is cut 
off because of this decision. The self-reliant young man or 
young ladj- who has the perseverance and determination to get 
an education will be able to overcome obstacles and make ways, 
and indeed it is a question whether it is not unfortunate for a 
young man to have his tuition paid if he is able to pay his way 
by his own efforts. We shall hope that there will continue to be 
the same interest and enthusiasm manifested in the high schools 
of our State that has so fully characterized them during the past 
year. 

Perhaps no other educational question in Nebraska has 
received as much attention and thought as that pertaining to free 
high school attendance. The anomaly of having a free educational 
system, and no provision for free high school privileges 
except for those who are fortunate enough to live within the 
boundaries of a high school district, is obvious. Two attempts 
have been made by our law-makers to enact legislation that 
would remedy this condition, but in each instance the law has 
been found defective, and at this time a great many young men 
and women are compelled to pay for their high school education. 
Information received from 146 city superintendents and principals 
discloses the fact that 2459 non-resident pupils availed themselves 
of the privileges furnished by the enactment of 1899. Out </seg>

of 90 county superintendents, 64 report that 2985 certificates 
were issued to pupils entitled to enjoy free high school privileges. 
These figures plainly indicate the favor in which the 
law was held, and as strongly indicate the necessity for legislation 
that will place it within the reach of all to secure Jree high 
school education. Although the fiee high school attendance actshave 
been declared unconstitutional, much good has resulted in 
that it has brought to the attention of the rural communities 
more fully the advantages of a high school education, and has 
caused a tide to set in toward the high schools from these rural 
districts.

can gather, and I shall appreciate your careful consideration of 
the above. Very respectfully, 

W. R. Jackson, 

Superintendent Public Instruction. 

Twenty-one counties contain schools in which one or both 
features of the law have been tried. Four furnished transportation 
only; four transportation and instruction, and thirteen furnished 
instruction alone. 

Replies from part of the twenty-one superintendents show that 
57 pupils were transported under the provisions of Section 4b, at 
a cost of $560. 158 pupils attended school in adjoining districts, 
under the provisions of Section 4c, for an average of 7 months at 
a total cost of $1471.40. Those making the report are unanimous 
in the opinion that the law is beneficial. Following are 
some of the replies to the 7th question: 

"Not fully understood by people." 

"LochI prejudice, ignorance of the true working of the law, 
object to sending small children in care of driver." 

"Most of our school districts are large so that distance to 
school would be too great for further consolidation." 

Generally the board wishes to furnish employment to some 

relative 

"Law not explicit enough." 

"To induce the school boards to properly make and sign the 
contract. So much easier to neglect." 

"The law has not generally been understood." 
"None; but too great distance." 

"Difficulty of transporting very small children in bad weather. 
Desire of some people to be exclusive." 

Under "Remarks" are found the following statements: 

"The law is a great blessing to our people and 14 out of 36 
pupils were transported by their parents free so as to get to a 
better and larger school." 

"I think the law will be very popular in this thinly populated 
county."

maintain school otherwise on account of the small number of 
pupils, or because of great indebtedness of the district, thus 
enabling the district to conduct a school and at the same time 
reduce indebtedness." 

Mrs. Stelle Smith, county superintendent of Hitchcock county, 
says: "It furnishes larger associations and better instruction for 
the pupils. Financially, is more economical. The objections I 
have met are in regard to transportation, — some argue that it 
would be too expensive and impracticable in the thinly settled 
districts, but I find that as the people get a better understanding 
of the law they are favorable toward it. 

Supt. W. H. Rhodes, of Thayer count}-, offers the following: 
"The children in Dist. No. 96 received nine months instruction 
at a cost of but $190.00 It would have cost $270.00 for a 
teacher's wages alone if they had maintained their own school. 
Both schools were helped because of increased attendance and 
consequent interest and emulation. Dist. No. 96 has never built 
a school house. The concentration of school districts must come 
in the future and it is now a question of molding sentiment in 
favor of the same, so that a law may be passed which will make 
it easier to concentrate. Under our prtsent system (without 
township organization) no district wishes to yield right of way to 
others, which is nt-cessary in order to put the combination into 
effect. The Kingsville plan is O. K. and works out very easily 
when one board has contract of a township." 

The department has repeatedly urged superintendents and 
school officers to avail themselves of the provisions of this law, 
but the inclination to be independent in fact as well as in name 
no doubt is the strongest barrier to overcome. The difficulty in 
inaugurating any new sytem, where prejudice and long established 
usages prevail, is met here as well as in other matters. 
We believe, however, that the plan is a good one and shall continue 
to advocate it. In time the people who now hold so tenaciously 
to the little inadequate home school will find that they can 
be better served and at less expense by taking advantage of the 
provision for uniting with another district. This will lead </seg>

ultimately to the consolidation of districts, and the maintaining of 
a system of graded schools in rural districts. 

NEEDED LEGISLATION. 

The following report of the committee on school legislation to 
the educational council, was unanimously adopted by that body, 
Oct. 5, 1900: 

Your committee on school legislation beg to report that, in 
their judgment, we should attempt to secure the enactment of 
the following items for school legislation: 

First, A satisfactory Free High School Attendance Law. 

Second, An Efficient Compulsory Education Law. 

Third, A law giving county superintendents authority to compel 
Institute Attendance. (Curative Act). 

Fourth, Removal of Six-Mile Limit to school, districts, and 
Increase of Valuation required to form new districts. 

Fifth, Legislation placing History among the required subjects 
for Third Grade Certificates, Music among subjects required, 
after 1901, for Second Grade Certificates, and some other minor 
changes in requirements for certificates. 

Sixth, Legislation regulating the Employment of Relatives of 
members of school boards. 

Seventh, Provisions for Reducing the Number of Examinations 
to be held by county superintendents annually . 

Respectfully submitted, 

Signed by the Committee, 

W. R. Jackson, 

Chairman. 

UNEQUAL TAXATION 

Probably the most serious difficulty in our present system is 
inequality of taxation in different districts. Some districts levy 
the full limit of the law and are then scarcely able to maintain 
three months' school; others, happening to have extensive railroad 
mileage or other valuable property, secure abundant revenue 
from a few mills tax. 

It has been urged as a remedy that we abolish the present 
independent districts and substitute the township or county sys- </seg>

            <seg id="p065">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT S KEPORT. 

tem. This does not seem to be practicable. The present district 
system is too firmly fixed; its overthrow would be too revolutionary. 
Whether desirable or otherwise it cannot be done. 
In this respect it would be like the much talked of county high 
school law which would have required ninety new schools, with 
costly buildings, and sweeping changes in our high school system. 
If a law were enacted providing that the County Board in 
each county should levy each year upon all taxable property of 
the county a general school tax of 5 mills, the proceeds of which 
shall be added to the county's share of the State apportionment, 
together with other county school funds, if any, to be applied to 
the salaries of teachers, and to be apportioned semi-annually by 
the county superintendent together with the State apportionment 
and upon the same basis, it would tend to equalize the burden of 
taxation. 

Another way of adjusting the unequal taxation would be to 
have a State school levy to augment the semi-annual apportionment 
of school funds apportioned by the State Department of 
Education. 

It is believed that no objection can be brought against this 
policy which would not be far outweighed by the advantages 
resulting from it. Of course, at the outset and until the plan is 
thoroughly understood, some petty objections would be made. 
This is the common lot of all improvements in the laws. 

AGRICULTURE IN THK SCHOOL 

There are three very important subjects which, in my estimation, 
should receive immediate and enthusiastic attention at the 
hands of educators and those who are responsible for the direction 
of educational affairs These subjects are, — manual training, 
poli ical economy and agriculture. The first and second of these 
have received more or less attention, and have, according to the 
efforts made, proven exceeding beneficial. The subject of agriculture 
has, on the other hand, been entirely ignored or but 
vaguely hinted at. I do not mean that agriculture as an occupation 
has been the recipient of so little attention, but as a possible 
subject to be taught in the schools outside of the agricultural col- </seg>

            <seg id="p066">
45 

AGRICULTURE IN THE SCHOOLS. 

lege, it has been, as far as this State is concerned, entirely overlooked. 
I am aware that the subject has received some attention 
at the hands of those who take part in farmers' institutes, and 
by editors of agricultural journals — these people have awakened 
to the necessities of the case. It is my purpose to show the 
importance and necessity of taking up this subject in the schools. 

The discussion of the incorporation of courses of study in 
domestic economy in our public schools, with special refere'nce to 
the needs of the girls, has been confined almost entirely to the 
cities. One branch of domestic economy has been presented at 
a number of farmers' institutes by Mrs. McMurphy, of Omaha, 
who has given lectures and practical demonstrations in cookery. 
I believe the sentiment for making a place for that study in our 
public school course is growing. Investigation will show that in 
manual training, in the specific work under the head of domestic 
economy, and in the work of agriculture we are far behind foreign 
countries. France, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, Norway 
and Sweden have all made far greater progress than we in giving 
instruction in agriculture in schools below the agricultural 
college. In several of these countries they have also made much 
progress in teaching domestic economy to pupils in the public 
schools. 

Text books on practical agriculture have been put into every 

rural school in the Province of Ontario, Canada, and teachers 
give it the same attention as other subjects. These books treat 
of the plant; soil; crops of the field; the garden, orchard and vinyard; 
live stock, and dairying; bees, birds, forestry, roads, the 
rural home; weeds, trees, and spraying mixtures. All this is very 
desirable, though one never expects to become a farmer. How 
much more to be desired by those who, from choice or necessity, 
make their homes on the farm! 

Agriculture is the basis of all other industries. At least onehalf 
of the people of Nebraska engaged in any pursuit are 
employed in some phase of farming. It would seem from its 
importance that the subject of agriculture and kindred subjects 
should receive attention at the hands of educators, and should be 
made a part of the course of study of our schools. Not neces- </seg>

sarily an advanced or complete text, but something of an elementary 
character to introduce the subject. This book need not 
be an exhaustive treatise of the subject of agriculture, but should 
contain enough of the scientific to make it of value, and should 
withal, be written in a style attractive and practical. 

Recognizing this branch of industry in this public manner will 
tend to elevate the calling, or at least to give it a dignity which, 
in the minds of many and especially the young, it does not appear 
to possess. 

The tendency of the times is toward commercialism and professionalism. 
Our schools have unconsciously fallen into the 
mistaken idea that the province of the school is to fit students to 
pursue a commercial or professional life. If schools do not 
directly teach this idea, pupils at least become imbued with that 
thought, and in consequence these fields of employment are overcrowded. 
Hundreds of applications for positions as clerks, stenographers, 
etc., are on file in the office of the Commissioner of 
Labor. There seems to be a growing desire on the part of our 
young men and women to get away from industrial labor, and 
especially from farm labor. 

I think no one will question the necessity of giving this subject 
more attention. If any one can propose a better or quicker way 
of getting the matter thoroughly before the people, than by its 
introduction through the schools, I for one, shall be glad to assist 
in the undertaking. I believe, however, that the school is the 
proper medium through which the principles of agriculture are 
to be taught. I believe the school can do much to bring the 
young to see and realize the economic value and importance of 
an education that includes a knowledge of agriculture. 

The purpose of teaching this subject is to give a knowledge 
of the "why" rather than a knowledge of the "how." The 
science of agriculture may be said to consist of a mingling of 
chemistry, geology, botany, entomology, physiology, bacteriology, 
and other sciences, in so far as they have a bearing upon 
agriculture. The aim should be to include but the first principles 
of these various sciences, and to show their application to 
the art of agriculture. </seg>

            <seg id="p068">
47 

AGRICULTURE IN THE SCHOOLS. 

I believe that the rational teaching of agriculture in public and 
high schools is not only possible, but would be exceedingly 
profitable. An intelligent understanding of the science underlying 
the art of agriculture will add much interest to what is 
otherwise hard work, and as a natural consequence the pleasure 
of such work may be greatly increased. The residents of our 
towns and cities also will find that some knowledge of the 
sciences of agriculture may be of use to them, and may increase 
the respect and consideration for the calling that contributes so 
largely to the general wealth and welfare of this country. 

By way of recapitulation, I will give some of the reasons why 
agriculture should be taught in the public schools of Nebraska. 

Nebraska is almost wholly an agricultural State, and from the 
very nature of things must always remain more or less so. 

A large proportion of the children in the public schools, and 
those who enter in the future, will from choice or necessity make 
their homes upon the farm. 

Agriculture being the basis of all other industries, a knowledge 
of the science of that subject is essential to its successful 
direction. 

Much of the knowledge necessary to the successful management 
of a farm, can and should be aquired in the school. 

The acquisition of this knowledge will create an interest in 
the subject and tend to keep the boys on the farm. 

It will elevate the dignity of the calling to the plane which it 
should, by virtue of its importance, occupy. 

It will result in a more prosperous and contented class of 
citizens. 

It will add to the wealth and prosperity of the State. 

"An investment in knowledge pays the best interest." That 
kind of knowledge which is of a practical nature is especially 
valuable. A knowledge of agriculture is especially practical 
and therefore valuable. 

For these and other reasons, the Course of Study for the 
schools of Nebraska should include the elements of agriculture, 
and the school law should be amended so as to include the </seg>

            <seg id="p069">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

"elements of agriculture" in the list of subjects required for 
teachers' certificates. 

THE FREE TEXT BOOK LAW 

The law enacted in 1891 providing that the text-books for 
use in the public schools of the State shall be furnished free to 
the pupils is still in force and effect. It has not been modified in 
anj' way. 

The purpose of the law is to secure to the people of each 
district the widest latitude in the management of their schools. 
The object of the law in authorizing the school districts to 
contract for the needed text-books was two-fold. 1st, to insure 
to the district the right to purchase the books at the very lowest 
wholesale rates offered on such books anywhere in the United 
States, thus securing to the district the benefit of universal competition 
throughout the country, and 2d, to protect the people of 
the district against the expense incident to too frequent changes. 

Preparatory to entering into a contract under the law, the publishers 
must first have filed with the State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction a sworn statement of their lowest wholesale 
prices of books, and must be willing to execute a bond for the 
protection of school districts contracting for the same. By this 
provision of the law, each district secures not only the benefit of 
competition in this State, but in all other States where the said 
publisher's books are used. The protection of the people of a 
district against too frequent changes in text-books is sought to 
be secured by the provision in the law authorizing school boards 
to enter into contracts with publishers for their books for a 
term of years. 

I might add that experience has shovvn that teachers moving 
from one district to another frequently feel it incumbent upon 
them to discard some of the books in use for others of the same 
kind but of different authorship. This disposition often exists 
where there is a large supply of the text it is proposed to throw 
out in good condition; and where the change is made, under 
such circumstances particularly, it results in large expense to 
the people of the district. The correct procedure for any school </seg>

board, in my opinion, is to exercise discriminating care in making 
its first selection of books, being solicitious to get the best that 
the market affords at the lowest obtainable price, then to keep 
its teachers informed from year to year as to the names of the 
books selected in the different grades, so that when handing in 
their requisition to the school officer charged with keeping up 
the supplies, none but the regularly adopted books will be called 
for. Of course, this suggestion is not intended to apply where 
new studies are added to the Course, or where the books in use 
need to be supplemented in the judgment of the teacher, acting 
with the Board, in order to secure the best results. 

PARIS EXPOSITION. 

The Hon. Howard J. Rogers, Director of Department of 
Education and Social Economy for the United States at the 
Paris Exposition, made a request upon this department for 
samples of blanks, courses of study, copy of school laws and 
reports of the Department, which would show in a general 
way our system of education. In compliance with this request 
there were forwarded samples of all forms of blanks and blank 
books, used by school officers and teachers in Nebraska, 
together with the Course of Study for rural and village schools, 
the high school manual, special day programs, registers, certificate 
books, school laws, and the biennial report of this office, the 
whole giving a very comprehensive view of our system of 
¦education. This same material will be placed on exhibition at 
the Pan-American Exposition, to be held in Buffalo. 

The following resolution was adopted by the Nebraska State 
Teachers' Association in 1898: 

Be it Resolved, 1st, That in the death of Supt. W. H. Skinner, 
the Association recognizes that the school interests of the State 
have suffered an irreparable loss. That in his works as an 
educator he has dome much in developing educational principles, 
in raising the educational standard, and in placing the 
schools of Nebraska upon a higher educational plane. 2d, That

RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE NEBRASKA STATE TEACHERS* 

ASSOCIATION IN I9OO. 

Your Committee on Resolutions beg leave to submit the following: 


Recognizing this educational gathering as the last one of 
Nebraska teachers for the closing century, we deem it especially 
fitting that it should be, as it is, the greatest in numbers and 
enthusiasm of any in the history of our beloved State. While 
rejoicing in the present and eagerly looking forward to a greater 
future, we are yet deeply grateful for the labor of those who 
have builded so well in the past. Among this number, we are 
called upon to record the name of S. D. Beals, of Omaha, who 
died last spring of congestion of the lungs. Mr. Beals was the 
first who filled the important office of State Superintendent of 
Nebraska, and for thirty years he was identified with the city 
schools of Omaha. Therefore, 

Be it Resolved, That we hereby express our appreciation of 
his high character as a man, and as an educational pioneer, and 
our sense of loss in his death. 

Inasmuch as there has recently been added to the roll of the 
beloved and honored dead, the name of Supt. Wm. J. Williams, 
of Columbus, therefore, 

Be it Resolved, That we hereby express our sincere sorrow 
at the loss of one of so much experience and ability in school 
work, one so long identified with Nebraska schools, a man so valuable 
to the State, not only for his talent, but also for his moral 
worth as a man and a citizen. </seg>

SPECIAL DAYS. 

SPECIAL DAYS. 

The observance of special days has become an essential part 
of the work of the schools. The lessons to be learned are fraught 
with sentiments which can be impressed upon the minds of our 
youth in no better way than by carrying out a program suited to 
the occasion, whatever it may be. 

The pupils of our schools need a little change of work occasionally. 
Reading, writing, and arithmetic become mere skeletons 
unless clothed with aesthetic, moral, and patriotic sentiments 
and while every lesson in the text-book may suggest some truth 
or sentiment other than the mere fact of the lesson, it has come 
to be recognized that special stress must be laid upon these subjects, 
and this can be done in no better way than by setting apart 
special days and devoting the entire time to their observance. 

These special days should be the means of bringing the patrons 
in closer touch with the schools, and while the schools should 
always be open to the patrons, teachers and pupils should make 
extra exertions to secure a good attendance of the patrons on 
these days. 

Special programs should be prepared and invitations sent to all 
within the district. The following pages contain much material 
suitable for the various occasions, and it is to be hoped that 
teachers and pupils will find the selections helpful and inspiring. 

With best wishes for a continued successful observance of the 
special days, I am, sincerely yours,

State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

BIRD DAY AND ARBOR DAY. 

GOVERNOR'S PROCLAMATION. 

'The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned 
To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave, 

And spread the roof above them — ere he framed 
The lofty vault, to gather and roll back 
The sound of anthems; in the darkling wood, 
Amid the cool and silence, he knelt down, 
And offered the mightiest solemn thanks 

And supplication." 

The broad fertile plains, the gentle uplands, and the beautiful 
valleys of our grand State seem to lack nothing to make them 
perfect except groves and forests. No fairer landscape can be 
seen in all the world than is presented in the portions of Nebraska 
where time has brought to perfection the work of the pioneers in 
tree planting. 

The planter of grain plants for himself. The planter of trees 
plants for others. The one plants for the present, the other for 
the future. 

With much wisdom our laws set apart a day each year devoted 
to tree planting. I would most earnestly call upon all our people 
to give it special observance this year. Let each school boy 
plant at least one tree which may be a shade for his noon-time of 
life. Let every young man plant a tree which may be a comfort 
in after years. Let every man of middle life plant a tree which 
may grow into a monument of his foresight, when his other 
work shall have been forgotten. Let all our people give up the 
day to tree planting. Plant shade trees. Plant ornamental trees. 
Plant fruit trees. Beautify the plains with trees. Lay aside the 
cares of every day business and engage in a work which shall 
render our already beautiful State more beautiful and more 
desirable. 

By the authority vested in me as Governor of Nebraska, I 
hereby proclaim and designate Saturday, April 22, 1899, Arbor 
Day. </seg>

Teachers and Pupils of Nebraska Schools : 

The appearance of sweet smelling and beautifully colored 
flowers, together with the joyful notes of our feathered friends, 
as they come up from the sunny Southland, remind us once again 
that spring is here. At this season of the year all Nature seems 
to take on new life, and joy and gladness reign supreme. 

I am happy to greet you as we approach the dawn of a new 
century, and hope that the thoughts and emotions created by a 
careful consideration of the possibilities that open before you 
may inspire you to nobler thoughts and grander deeds. 

The object of this book is to place before you thoughts that 
will tend to give you higher ideals. I am sure that when you 
fully realize the economic value of birds and trees, to say nothing 
of the pleasure which their presence and cultivation bring, you 
will forever be the friends and protectors of these gracious gifts 
of an Allwise Father. 

The wanton destruction of birds has reached such a point that 
our lawmakers have felt the necessity of enacting laws for their 
protection. It would be a source of great satisfaction, however, 
to know and feel that the bovs of the great State of Nebraska 
refrain from killing birds and other harmless creatures from a 
higher motive than the mere fulfilling of statutory law. 1 should 
be pleased to learn of societies formed all over the State for the 
protection of birds. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPOKT. 

Nebraska was the pioneer State in inaugurating "Arbor Day," 
and among the first to recommend a "Bird Day." Let us strive 
to maintain the position which the State occupies in this regard, 
and continue to lead in educational matters. 

Trusting that the day may be fraught with pleasant and profitable 
exercises, I am, 

Yours for the protection of birds and the planting of trees,

State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 

HISTORY OF ARBOR DAY. 

At an annual meeting of the State Board of Agriculture at 
Lincoln, Nebraska, January 4, 1872, the Hon. J. Sterling Morton 
introduced the following resolution, which was unanimously 
adopted : 

"Resolved, That Wednesday, the 10th day of April, 1872, be 
and the same is hereby especially set apart and consecrated for 
tree planting in the State of Nebraska, and the State Board of 
Agriculture hereby name it Arbor Day, and urge upon the people 
of the State the vital importance of tree planting, and hereby 
offer a special premium of $100, to the agricultural society of 
that county in Nebraska which shall upon that day plant properlv 
the largest number of trees; and a farm library of $25 
worth of books to that person who, on that day, shall plant properly, 
in Nebraska, the greatest number of trees." 

Over a million of trees were planted in Nebraska on the first 
Arbor Day, April 10, 1872. 

In 1875 the Governor of Nebraska, by public proclamation, 
set apart the third Wednesday of April as a day to be observed 
in the planting of trees. Annuallv thereafter other governors 
made such proclamation until the winter of 1885, when the Legislature 
passed the act which designates the 2 2d of April, birthday 
of Mr. Morton, of each year as Arbor Day, and making it one 
of the legal holidays of the State. 

Then in 1895 the name and the fame of Nebraska was further 
recognized and fixed by the following joint resolution which was 
approved by the Governor, April 4, 1895.</seg> 

            <seg id="p076">
SPECIAL DAYS. 

55 

"Whereas, The State of Nebraska has heretofore, in a popular 
sense, been designated by names not in harmony with its history, 
industry, or ambition; and 

"Whereas, The State is pre-eminently a tree-planting state ; and 

"Whereas, Numerous and honorable State organizations have 
by resolution, designated Nebraska as the 'Tree Planter's State;' 
therefore be it 

"Resolved, By the Legislature of the State of Nebraska, that 
Nebraska shall hereafter, in a popular sense, be known and 
referred to as the 'Tree Planter's State.' " 

At the same session, and as an outgrowth of the same sentiment, 
the following joint resolution was also adopted: 

"Whereas, The adoption of a State floral emblem, by the 
authority of the Legislature, would fo&amp;ter a feeling of pride in 
our State and stimulate an interest in the history and traditions 
of the commonwealth; therefore be it 

"Resolved, That the Senate concurring, we, the Legislature of 
Nebraska, hereby declare the flower commonly known as the 
'Golden Rod' {Solidago serotina) to be the floral emblem of the 
State." 

Approved April 4, A. D. 1895. 

Arbor Day is now observed in accordance with legislative act, 

or annual public proclamation, in forty States and Territories. It 
is a legal holiday in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, 
Nebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin 
and Wyoming.

Dear Sir. — I have yours of the 8th, and hasten to assure you 
of my entire concurrence with you as to the importance of the 
preservation of the birds of Nebraska. There ought to be a

it a penal offense to kill any wild bird in the State during the 
next five years. This should include hawks, owls, buzzards and 
crows as well as game birds. The former are great coadjutors 
of the farmer. They are not credited with half their just dues 
for their destruction of field mice, rabbits, and other pests. Every 
one of the so-called bad birds, which ignorant people shoot, like 
hawks, owls, and crows, are really benefactors. 

About the year 1895 I addressed a letter to the Superintendent 
of schools at Oil City, Penn., in favor of a bird day for the 
schools, and if possible I will hunt it up and send you a copy of 
it before the 1st of March.

LETTER TO MR. BABCOCK TO WHICH MR. MORTON REFERRED IN 

THE ABOVE. 

Washington, D. C, April 23, 1894 

Mr. C. A. Babcock, Superintendent of Schools, Oil City, Penn. 

Dear Sir. — Your proposition to establish a Bird Day on the 
same general plan as Arbor Day has my. cordial approval. 

Such a movement can hardly fail to promote the development 
of a healthy public sentiment toward our native birds, favoring 
their preservation and increase. 

It is a melancholy fact that among the enemies of our birds 
two of the most destructive and relentless are our women and 
our boys. The love of feather ornamentation so heartlessly 

persisted in by thousands of women, and the mania for collei ting 
eggs and killing birds so deeply rooted in our boy», are legacies 
of barbarism inherited from our savage ancestry. The number 
of beautiful and useful birds annually slaughtered for bonnet 
trimmings runs up into the hundreds of thousands, and threatens, 
if it has not already accomplished, the extermination of some of 
the rarer species. The insiduous egg-hunting and pea-shooting 
proclivities of the small boy are hardly less wide-spread and 
destructive. It matters little which of the two agencies is the 
more fatal, since neither is productive of anv good. The evil is 
one against which legislation can be only palliative and of local </seg>

efficiency. Public sentiment, on the other hand, if properly 
fostered in the schools, would gain force with the growth and 
development of our boys and girls, and would become a hundredfold 
more potent than any law enacted by the State or Congress. 
I believe such a sentiment can be developed, so strong and so 
universal, that a respectable woman will be ashamed to be seen 
with the wing of a wild bird on her bonnet, and an honest boy 
will be ashamed to own that he ever robbed a nest or wantonly 
took the life of a bird. 

Birds are of inestimable value to mankind. Without their 
unremitting services our gardens and fields would be laid waste 
by insect pests. But we owe them a greater debt even than 
this, for the study of birds tends to develop some of the best 
attributes and impulses of our natures. Among them we find 
examples of generosity, unselfish devotion, of the love of mother 
for offspring and other estimable qualities. Their industry t 
patience, and ingenuity excite our admiration; their songs inspire 
us with a love of music and poetry; their beautiful plumages and 
graceful manners appeal to our aesthetic sense; their long migrations 
to distant lands stimulate our imagination and tempt us to 
inquire into the causes of these periodic movements, and finally, 
the endless modifications of form and habits by which they are 
enabled to live under most diverse conditions of food and 
climate— on land and at sea — invite the student of Nature into 
inexhaustible fields of pleasurable research. 

The cause of bird protection is one that appeals to the best 
side of our natures. Let us yield to the appeal. Let us have a 
Bird Day — a day set apart from all other days of the year to tell 
the children about the birds. But we must not stop here. We 
should strive continually to develop and intensify the sentiment of 
bird protection, not alone for the sake of preserving the birds, 
but also for the sake of replacing, as far as possible, the barbaric 
impulses inherent in child nature by the nobler impulses and 
aspirations that should characterize advanced civilization.

8TATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Bird Day has been established by legislative act in Wisconsin; 
and Massachusetts has passed a law protecting the birds, 
especially certain song birds, of that State. The following 
resolution is before our present Legislature, and we trust will 
be enacted into law : 

"Whereas, We recognize the fact that birds in general, and 
some in particular, are the friends of man; and 

"Whereas, There appears to be an almost general ignorance 
regarding this fact, and the wanton destruction of birds seems to 
be increasing all over the land, rather than diminishing, it is the 
sense of this Legislature that a better and more general 
knowledge of birds on the part of our citizens would tend toward 
protecting our feathered friends; therefore, be it 

Resolved, That, the House concurring, we, the Legislature of 
Nebraska, hereby designate the Friday falling the nearest to the 
middle of the month of May of each year as "Bird Day." on 
which day it shall be the duty of all schools within the State to 
observe the occasion by exercises in the form of lectures, readings 
of bird literature, the writing of essays and singing of songs 
about birds, as well as the recounting of personal experiences 
with these creatures."

THE PLANTING OF TREES. 

[Written for Nebraska Bird and Arbor Day Manual by Prof. F. W. 
Taylor, University of Nebraska.] 

I. KIND TO PLANT 

It is a very easy matter in choosing what kind of trees to 
plant to make a mistake which will almost do away with the 
possible good which should result from the planting of trees. 
It is very easy to get and to plant such trees as the willow, the 
cottonwood, boxelder, soft maple, or others which, though 
perhaps not bad in their way, are not long-lived and are not 
sufficiently good for street or school ground purposes. A tree 
for that use should be one which is reasonably sure, if well cared 
for, to be long-lived; and if it is long-lived it is almost equally 
sure that it will be comparatively slow in its habits of growth. 

All over Nebraska and the other Western States immense 
numbers of the soft-wooded trees like those named above have 
been planted, and it is doubtful whether to-day there can be 
found living one for each thousand that have been planted. 
Even after they have grown for a good many years, such trees 

re liable to break down or split during times of storm, and then 
fter having lived a good quarter of the time a good shade tree 

should live, thev die. 

It can not be too strongly urged that only good varieties 
should be planted. Some of these are white elm, hackberry, 
hard maple, and perhaps some of the hardy evergreens, such as 
spruce or rir from the Rocky Mountains. The western red 
cedar is perfectly hardy and will withstand almost all kinds of 
bad treatment, but it is so sure to turn brown in the winter time 
and to become draggled and ragged in appearance that it is not 
satisfactory. The list of good trees given may seem to be very 
short, but the planter who sticks to these kinds will in later years 
be entirely satisfied with his selection, and the probability is that 
his children and grandchildren may enjoy the shade of such 
trees, while if the others are used they are sure to disappear 
within a short time. </seg>

II. HOW TO PLANT. 

To properly plant trees is a comparatively simple thing, and 
something which everyone should know. Most Nebraska soil is 
good and rich enough to supply all the needs of the roots of the 
trees if they are properly planted. It is more often likely to do 
more harm than good to mix with the soil anything such as 
gravel, manure, or other foreign substances. Good, black loam 
answers every need, and it is better alone than mixed with almost 
anything else. 

The hole in which a tree is to be set should be dug considerably 
larger than will comfortably hold the roots of the tree when 
they are spread out at full length. Loose earth should be 
thrown among the roots of the tree when it has been set in place, 
and as soon as the roots are covered it should be pressed down 
with the foot until it is well packed. If the soil is very dry, 
water may be added as the planting is done, but an inch or two 
at the top should not be soaked or it is likely to bake, and thus 
the watering do more harm than good. Afier the trees have 

been set, if the weather is quite 
two or three davs. It is best

III. PREPARING THF 

TREE FOR PLANTING. 

The largest tree is not necessarily the best tree to plant. 
Other things being equal, the tree that can be removed with the 
greatest portion of its roots is the best tree to plant. If very 
large trees are used a large portion of the root system is necessarily 
removed in digging, and a proportionate amount of the top 
should be cut back. 

Never allow the roots of a tree to be exposed to the sun nor 
to become dry. 

Trees that have grown in the timber are much harder to 
make live when transplanted than those which have been grown 
in nursery rows. The latter are likely to have been transplanted 
once or twice or more, and each time a tree is transplanted its </seg>

BIRD MIGRATION. 

[The following poem, written for Nebraska Bird and 
bore no other signature than "A Teacher."] 

In the days of the flood 
When the ark was afloat 

And naught of land could be seen, 
Then Noah, in doubt, 

A raven sent out, 
Which returned with an olive leaf green 

And ever since then 
On earth among men 

The birds their messages bring; 
The world is made bright 
By the tones of delight 

From the merry songs they sing. 

In early spring days, 
When cold winter's haze 

Is driven far north for the spring, 
Through the livelong day 

The merry birds' lay 

Make meadow and woodland ring. 

The meadow lark's trill, 
Like the rippling rill, 

Is sounded from orchard trees white; 
And robin redbreast 

In her new oozy nest 

Sits over her eggs day and night. 

The boasting bluejay 
Ne'er ceases his lay, 

But proud of his plumage and station, 
He never grows weary 

Of making life dreary, 
As he lords over all bird creation. 

And then comes the crow, 
And his "caws" you know 

Is just, though it never is granted, 
For with a great greed 

He plucks up the seed 
That the farmer so carefully planted. </seg>

Through the long summer days, 
'Neath the warm sun's rays, 

'Midst ripening grain and the clover 
The glad song is heard 

From each singing bird, 

As he wanders the golden field over. 

When autumn draws near 
With winds cold and drear 

Their coats are too thin for the weather, 
Away from the storm, 

To the South where it's warm, 
They live through the winter together. 

A PLEA FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR BIRDS. 

PROF. LAWRENCE BRUNER, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA. 

The fact that insect depredations are increasing in extent each 
succeeding year makes it plain to us that something must be 
done to prevent it, and that quickly. We have found to our 
sorrow, that although we are continually making increased 
efforts to destroy these pests, our efforts avail but little, and the 
destruction of our crops goes on. What, then, is to be doner 
How can we be released from this ever increasing struggle for 
existence? 

The answer is plain. Heed the advice of the naturalist who 
has made a study of the life-histories of the various other living 
creatures in the world about us. Do not condemn what he says 
without at least examining into it a little. 

In his desire for bird protection the naturalist is not prompted 
by sentiment alone — far from it! Although from the sentimental 
standpoint solely the friend of birds would have sufficient grounds 
for making such a request. 

But if we can not take up the subject of bird protection from 
the humane standpoint, if we have no cord of sympathy or sense 
of honor remaining, are we willing to adopt business principles 
in our dealings with the birds? 

It is needless here for me to state that the insect life about us 
is numerous and varied. We all know this to be too true. 
Nearly, if not quite, nine-tenths of all animal forms belong here, 
while the individuals of many kinds are incalculable. We know </seg>

            <seg id="p084">
63 

SPECIAL DAYS. 

also that their powers of reproduction are simply wonderful, 
being limited only by the amount of food available, etc. Now, 
the disproportionate number of birds, on the other hand, with 
their "universal distribution, the remarkable locomotive power 
which enables them readily to escape unfavorable conditions, and 
their higher rate of life, requiring for their maintenance an 
amount of food relatively eriormous," give to them a significance 
which few seem ever to have realized. 

Briefly told, the economic relation of birds to man lies in the 
services which they render in checking the undue increase of 
insects, the devouring of small rodents, in destroying the seeds 
of noxious weeds, and by acting as scavengers on land and 
water. 

Those who have studied the subject carefully have estimated 
that a loss of nearly $400,000,000 is sustained annually by the 
cultivators of the soil from insect ravages in the United States 
and Canada. This does not include the darqage done to ornamental 
shrubbery, shade and forest trees, nor to the grasses 
growing on our prairies. "But if insects are the natural enemies 
of vegetation, birds are the natural enemies of insects." 

"In the air swallows and swifts are coursing rapidly to and fro, 
ever in pursuit of insects which constitute their sole food. When 
they retire, the night-hawks and whip-poor-wills will take up the 
chase, catching moths and other nocturnal insects which would 
escape day-flying birds. Fly-catchers lie in wait, darting from 
ambush at passing prey, and with a suggestive click of the bill 
returning to their post. The warblers, light, active creatures, 
flutter about the terminal foliage, and with almost the skill of a 
humming-bird, pick insects from the leaf or blossom. The vireos 
patiently explore the undersides of leaves and odd nooks and 
corners to see that no skulker escapes. The woodpeckers, nuthatches, 
and creepers attend to the trunks and limbs, examining 
carefully each inch of bark for insects' eggs and larvae, or excavating 
for the ants and borers they hear within. On the ground 
the hunt is continued by the thrushes, sparrows, and other birds 
that feed upon the innumerable forms of terrestial insects. Few 
places in which insects exist are neglected ; even some species </seg>

which pass their earlier stages or entire lives in the water are 
preyed upon by aquatic birds."* 

In nearly every case where the food habits of our birds have 
been carefully studied, do we find that the good done far exceeds 
the possible harm that might be inflicted by our birds. Allowing 
twenty«.five insects per day as an average diet for each individual 
bird, and estimating that we have about one and one-half birds 

to the acre, or in round numbers 75&gt;ooo,ooo birds in Nebraska, 
there would be required 1,875,000,000 insects for each days 

? 

rations. 

Again, estimating the number of insects required to fill a 
a bushel at 120,000, it would take 15,625 bushels of insects to 
feed our birds for a single day, or 937,500 bushels for 60 days 
or 2,343,750 bushels for 150 days. These estimates are very 
low when we take into consideration the number of insects that 
various of our birds have been known to destroy in a single day. 
For example, the stomachs of four chickadees contained 1,028 
eggs of cankerworms. Four others contained about 600 eggs 
and 105 mature females of the same insect. The stomach of a 
single quail contained 101 potato beetles; and that of another 
upwards of 500 chinch-bugs. A yellow-billed cuckoo shot at 
six o'clock in the morning contained forty-three tent caterpillars. 
A robin had eaten 175 larvae of Bibio, which feed on the roots 
of grasses, etc., etc. 

Birds, like all other animals, feed upon that food which is 
most readily obtained, hence the insectivorous kinds destroy 
those insects which are most numerous — the injurious species. 

Estimating that there is a single grasshopper, katydid, or 
cricket to each square yard of surface, it would require at least 
650,000 bushels of these insects to cover the State. Not taking 
into account any of the myriads of other insect forms nor the 
rapid rate of reproduction which is going on among them, these 
alone would be nearly one-third enough insect food for our birds 
during the year. This being true, it is plain that at least twice 
as many birds could find the proper insect food in our State 
each year.

SPECIAL DAYS. 

A perusal of the various works that have been written on the 
economic relations of the birds to man will support the statement 
that, if we were deprived of the services of birds, the 
earth would soon become uninhabitable. 

In addition to the actual good that birds do as recorded above 
in the destruction of noxious insects, many of them are engaged 
for at least one-half of the year in hunting out and devouring 
the seeds of various weeds and other, to us, useless plants. 
Such is the mission of the various sparrows, snowbirds, finches, 
and long-spurs which often occupy our fields in flocks of thousands 
during the winter months. 

If, after ascertaining such truths as the above regarding birds, 
we continue to slaughter them, it is not due to thoughtlessness 
¦on our part. We do it wi fully and maliciously. The schoolboy 
may thoughtlessly rob a bird's nest or kill a bird or two. It is 
the duty of teacher and parent alike to teach him better, to show 
him how wrong it is to destroy life uselessly. It is especially 
their duty to prevent the destruction of birds. If each schoolboy 
in the State of Nebraska were to rob a nest of say five bird's 
eggs, what would be the result? Yet the making of bird-egg 
collections is getting to be such a "fad" that almost every boy 
enters into it more or less zealously at some time or other. 
Some single collectors in a single season take 500 or more eggs. 
This should be stopped. We can study birds and their nests 
without destroying either. A live bird is more interesting than 
a dead one. An egg left in a nest where it will in due time 
become a live creature is of more interest than an empty egg 
shell. 

We, as citizens of the United States, pride ourselves on being 
highly civilized and humane. We are in some directions, in 
¦others not. We also claim to be intensely practical and businesslike 
in everything. Are we? 

If thou art worn and hard beset 
With sorrows, that thou would'st forget: 
If thou would'st read a lesson, that will keep 
Thy heart from fainting and thy soul from sleep, 
Go to the woods and hills'! No tears 
Dim the sweet look that Nature wears.

A RETROSPECT. 

To breezy, balmy, beauteous spring 
The tribute of my love I bring. 
Hep joys my feeble pen cannot 
Embalm in just poetic thought. 
The springtime always takes me back 
Along life's thorn-environed track 
To childhood's home — and I can see 
The old log house that sheltered me: 
I see the lake, and hear once more 
The waves break on its pebbled shore. 
There rise the hill-tops fair and green, 
And there the sloughs that lie between, 
Where muskrats builded without fear 
And wild geese nested every year. 
There the log school house greets my eye. 
And there the great oak grows near by, 
Where oft was taxed my boyish strength 
In sawing timber, fence post-length. 
I think of those glad scenes again, 
Of forms that walked beside me tben 
(Now scattered far beyond my quest, 
Or taking their eternal rest.) 

And so, about this time of vear, 

Some thoughts too sad for record here 
Come, gently as an April rain. 

To give my joy a shade of pain. 
From my uplifted window here. 
I watch the snowdrifts disappear: 
I hear the robin red-breast sing. 
I see the wild goose on the wing, 
And all this makes me feel once more 
As happy as in days of yore.

FORESTS. 

Forests have always been admired, and in ancient times they 
were often considered sacred, the special dwelling-places of god&amp; 
and various strange beings. We can easily understand howforests 
thus affected men. There is a solemnity about them, a 
quiet grandeur, which is very impressive, and the rustling of 
their branches and leaves has that mysterious sound which 
caused the ancients to people them with spirits. We stiil 
recognize the feeling of awe that comes in the presence ofc </seg>

forests, although we have long since ceased to explain it by 
peopling them with spirits. 

Once forests covered all parts of the earth where plants could 
grow well, and no country had greater forests than North 
America. When America was discovered, there was a huge, 
unbroken forest from the Atlantic west to the prairies. Now 
much of this has been cut away, and we see only small patches 
of it. Men must use the forest and still they must save it, and 
they are now trying to find out how they may do both. 

Forests are sometimes almost entirely made up of one kind of 
tree, and then they are called "pure forests." Pine and beech 
forests are examples of this kind. More common with us, 
however, are the "mixed forests," made up of many kinds of 
trees, and nowhere in the world are there such mixed forests as 
in our Middle States, where beach, oak, hickory, maple, elm, 
poplar, gum, walnut, sycamore, and many others all grow 
together. 

Probably the densest forests in the world are those in the 
Amazon region of South America. So dense are they that 
hardly a ray of light ever sifts through the dense foliage, and 
even at noon there is only a dim twilight beneath the trees. The 
tallest forests are the Eucalyptus forests of Australia, where the 
trees rise with slender trunks to the height of four or five 
hundred feet. But the largests trees in the world, when we 
consider both height and diameter, are the giant "redwoods" 
(Sequoias) of the Pacific coast. All concede, however, that the 
most extensive, the most varied, and the most beautiful forests 
of the world are those of the Atlantic and Middle States. 

Pehaps it is well to understand how a tree lives, that we may 
know better what a forest means. The great roots spread 
through the soil, sometimes not far from the surface, at other 
times penetrating deeply. The young root tips are very sensitive 
to the presence of moisture, and turn towards it, no matter 
in what direction it may carry them. In penetrating the soil the 
sensitive root tips are turned in every direction by various 
influences of this kind, and as a result, when the root system 
becomes old, it looks like an inextricable tangle. All this tangle, </seg>

however, but represents the many paths that the root tips followed 
in their search for the things which the soil contains. 

Roots are doing two things for the tree: They anchor it 
firmly in the soil, and also absorb material that is to help in the 
manufacture of food. It is the older roots that have long since 
stopped absorbing that are the chief anchors. How firm this 
anchorage must be we can, perhaps, imagine when we think of 
the strain produced by a great crown of leaves swaying back 
and forth in the wind. It is only a cyclone that seems to be able 
to overthrow a sound tree, and then it more commonly breaks 
its trunk than uproots it. 

The very important work of absorbing is given over to the 
very young roots; in fact, chiefly to those of this year, for new 
rootlets must be put out each year. These roots can only absorb 
water, so that if they are to get anything from the soil it must be 
something that water will dissolve. In this way the water is 
used as the carrier of soil-material into the root. Just how this 
water carrying soil material gets into the root is not easy to 
explain, for the root has no holes to let it in, and it must pass 
through living walls. That it does enter, however, every one 
knows. It is evident, therefore, that the root is supplying to the 
tree two kinds of raw material for food manufacture obtained 
from the soil, namely, water and soil-material dissolved in it. 

But the tree does not obtain all its raw material from the soil. 
A very important material is taken from the air, the material 
commonly called "carbonic acid gas," the same material that we 
breathe out so abundantly from our lungs as one of our body 
wastes. This important material is taken out of the air into the 
plant chiefly by means of the leaves. Spread out as they are in 
the air, the leaves are in the most favorable position for doing 
this work. 

But where and how are these three kinds of raw material 
manufactured into plant food? The leaves are specially constructed 
to be the chief seat of this food manufacture. The carbon 
gas is received directly into these manufactories from the air, 
but the water and the soil-material are down in the roots, and it 
is necessary for them to be carried to the leaves. As a conse- </seg>

            <seg id="p103">

quence, a ''current" of water containing soil-material ascends 
from the roots, through the stem, and is distributed through the 
branches to the leaves. This movement is generally known as 
the "ascent of sap." The path of this movement in the stem is 
through what is known as the "sap wood," and it is this very 
fact which gives to this region of the wood its peculiar character. 
Just how the sap ascends through the stem and reaches the 
leaves, no one knows. All of our explanations have proved 
unsatisfactory, and only those who are not fully acquainted with 
the facts claim to be able to explain it. 

When the sap reaches the leaves, the water is no longer 
needed as a carrier of soil-material. Some of it is needed in the 
manufacture of food, but by far the greater part of it escapes 
from the leaves into the air by a process which may be called 
"plant evaporation." The amount of water thus brought from 
the soil and poured out into the air by active plants is very great; 
and when we consider a forest at work, we can hardly compute 
the vast amount of moisture which it is constantly contributing 
to the air during the growing season. 

The three kinds of raw material thus brought together chiefly 
in the leaves are there manufactured into plant food. On account 
of this work the leaves have often been spoken of as the 
"stomachs" of the plant. This is a very incorrect and misleading 
illustration, for the work referred to is not digestion such as 
a stomach is concerned with, and, in fact, it is a process entirely 
unknown in animals, and found only in green plants. It is a 
wonderful process, which we do not at all understand, but it consists 
in taking this dead raw material from the soil and air and 
manufacturing out of it living material. Not only does the food 
of the plant, and hence its life, depend upon this process, but all 
the life of the world, as we understand it, depends upon it. We 
know at least two prominent conditions of this process, for it 
seems evident that it cannot take place without light and the 
peculiar green substance which gives the characteristic color to 
leaves. With the help of light and this green coloring substance, 
known as "chlorophyll," the living substance in the leaves is 
able to do this marvelous work. </seg>

            <seg id="p104">
83 

SPECIAL DAYS. 

The food thus manufactured is distributed throughout the 
tree, either to be used wherever growth is going on, or to be 
stored up. While we may say that there is an "ascending current" 
of sap through the sap wood, it is an error to say that there 
is a "descending current." The movement of prepared food has 
no definite channel, but it is drawn in every direction wherever 
needed. 

If we now consider the parts of a tree all together, we may be 
able to get some notion of the meaning of their positions. The 
roots must be related to the soil to secure anchorage and raw 
material for food manufacture. The leaves must be related to 
the air and light to secure more raw material and help in doing 
their important work of food manufacture. The stem is simply 
to carry the leaves well up into the air and sunshine, and has no 
meaning except as it is related to the work, of the leaves. In thus 
widely separating the roots and the leaves, the stem must act as 
a channel of communication between them. 

In the tree trunks with which we are familiar, everyone has 
observed the concentric rings of wood that appear in a crosssection. 
These are usually spoken of as "annual rings" with the 
idea that one ring is made each year. In consequence of this it 
is the habit to estimate the age of a tree by counting these 
rings. Not infrequently it happens, however, that more than one 
ring may be made in a year, as a ring represents a single season 
of growth, and there may be more than one season of growth 
during a single year. It is much better to call them "growth 
rings," and to recognize the fact that by counting them we may 
be overestimating the age of a tree. 

One of the most noticeable things about the principal trees of 
our temperate climate is that they "shed" their leaves every year, 
being covered with foliage during the growing season and bare 
during the winter. This is known as the "deciduous" habit, and 
such trees are called deciduous trees, in distinction from "evergreen" 
trees. This is really a habit, brought about by the conditions 
in which trees of temperate climates must live. The leaves 
of such trees are broad and thin, fitted for very active work. 
When the winter comes, they would be entirely unable to endure </seg>

it. The tree might protect them by giving them narrow forms 
and thick walls (as in pines), but it would be at the expense of 
activity during the growing season. It is more economical for 
the tree to make an entirely new set of leaves each year than to 
protect the old ones. 

Perhaps the most noticeable feature in connection with the fall of 
the leaves is that so many of them take on a rich coloration. Our 
mixed American forest is the most brilliantly colored autumnal 
forest in the world, and there can be no landscapes richer in color 
than those which include such a forest. While all this should 
appeal to our sense of the beautiful, it should raise the question 
as to what it means in the life of the trees. We are not at all sure 
that we know, for we cannot as yet explain the conditions which 
cause the colors to be produced. We observe that they occur 
towards the end of the activity of the leaf, but that they are necessarily 
associated with cold, or drought, or certain outside conditions, 
is not at all clear. The colors are various shades of red and 
yellow, sometimes pure, sometimes mixed. It has been recently 
suggested that the red color is to serve as a protection. It is 
known that before the fall of the leaf the living substances are 
gradually withdrawn into the permanent parts of the tree, and 
that -when these living parts cease to work they are peculiarly 
helpless. At this unprotected period the red appears, and this 
color absorbs enough heat from the light to raise the temperature, 
and so the needed protection against chill is afforded. This seems 
reasonable, but the whole subject of the meaning of plant colors 
is very obscure.

All her wealth of laughing sunshine,

DAME NATURE'S RECIPE. 
Take a dozen little clouds 

And a patch of blue; 

Take a million raindrops, 
As many sunbeams, too. 

Take a host of violets, 
A wandering little breeze, 

And myriads of little leaves 
Dancing on the trees. 

Then mix them well together, 
In the very quickest way, 

Showers and sunshine; birds and flowers, 
And you'll have an April day.

OH, SPRING HAS COME! 

[Tune— "Beulah Land.' 

Oh, spring- has come, the winter's o'er, 
And we, the birds, are here once more, 
We come, we come, across the sea, 
And swing and sing on bush and tree. 

Chorus. 

O spring time fair; O spring time fair; 
How sweet the blossom-scented air, 
That softly blows o'er hill and plain, 
Above the fields of starting grain, 
While wild birds in the thickets sing, 
Where birchen tassels sway and swing.

LITTLE BIRD BLUE. 

Little bird blue, come sing us a song; 
The cold winter weather has lasted so long, 
We're tired of skates, and we're tired of sleds, 
We're tired of snowbanks as hiyh as our heads: 

Now we're watching for you, 
Little bird blue. 

Soon as you sing, then the springtime will com 
The ribinb will call and the honey bees hum, 
And the dear little pussy, so cunning and gray, 
Will sit in the willow trees over the way; 

So hurry, please do, 

Little bird blue. 

We're longing to hunt in the woods, for we know 
Just where the spriug beauties and liver-wort grow 
W're sure they will peep when they hear your first 
But why are you keeping us waiting so long, 

All waiting for you, 

Little bird blue?

'Tis the loveliest time of all the year 

Enjoy it ere 'tis past.

A NEW BOSTON TEA PARTY 

(A Nebraskan, paying a summer visit to the grave of Paul Revere, found 
a party of children seated around the Sat gravestone as a tea table, 
rejoicing in the company of a chorus of birds and unconscious of everything 
but the joy of a June day.) 

Still making tea? — these more than hundred years 
Since the tea-party of historic date: — 

Boston defying Commerce, King and fears, 
In her own harbor brewed her cup of fate. 

Yet the tea-party spirit lingers here 
When happy Boston children at their play 

Make their tea table tomb of Paul Revere, — 
Careless of Charlestown's ride or Concord's fray; 

Above, the leafy corridors of June, — 

Beneath, — tho#e ashes once a naming spark, — 
While fearless prattles Freedom's glad forenoon 

Where Freedom's morning rose so red and dark. 
Ride on, oh restless soul of rider true, — 

Rest on, oh ashes of the daring dead, — 
This is the triumph Time hath given you — 

That Freedom's birds and children crown thy head.

TrtE QUAILS' QUADRILLE. 

One who loves birds and who is so much in sympathy with 
them as to make it appear sometimes that they have taken her 
into their "order," had a charming glimpse, a few years ago, of 
a covey of quails in one of their frolics. She described it as 
follows: 

"I never hear the call of 'Ah, Bob White!" or catch a glimpse 
of those shy little vocalists, that I do not think of how I once 
surprised them in the prettiest dance I ever saw. I had heard of 
the games and frolics of birds and have often watched them with </seg>

delight, but I never saw any bird-play that interested me as this, 
that seemed like a quadrille of a little company of quails. 

"They were holding their pretty carnival at the side of a 
country road along which I was slowly strolling, and I came in 
sight of them so quietly as to be for a time unobserved, although 
they had two little sentinels posted — one at each end of the company. 


"Between these bright-eyed little watchers, always on the 
alert, a dozen or more birds were tip-toeing in a square: Every 
motion was with all the grace and harmony which are Nature's 
own. At some little bird-signal which I didn't see, two birds 
advanced from diagonal corners of the square, each bird tripping 
along with short, airy, and graceful steps, something like what 
we imagine characterized the old-time 'minuet.' Each bird, as 
the partners came near each other, bobbed its head in a graceful 
little bow, and both tripped back as they came to their places in 
the square. Immediately the birds from the two other corners 
advanced with the same airy grace, the same short, quick, and 
tripping steps, saluting and retreating as the others had done. 

"A wagon driving along the road disturbed the band of dancers, 
who scudded away under the leaves, through the fence, into the 
deep grass of the field beyond. When the team had passed out 
of sight and the ballroom was again their own, back came the 
pretty revelers stealthily, their brown heads uplifted as their eyes 
scanned the landscape. Seeing no intruder, they again took 
their places the same as before and began again the same quadrill 
— advancing, meeting, bowing, and retreating. 

"It was the prettiest and most graceful little 'society affair' you 
can imagine. There was no music — no song that I could hear — 
yet every little bird, in every turn and step while the dance was 
on, moved as to a measured harmony. 

"Did the birds keep 'time — time, in a sort of runic rhyme' to 
melody in their hearts, or to a symphony I could not hear, but 
which goes up unceasingly like a hymn of praise from Nature's 
great orchestra? I longed to know. 

"In my delight and desire to learn more of the bewitching 
bird-play, I half forgot I was a clumsy woman, and an uncon- </seg>

scious movement betrayed my presence. The little sentinel 
nearest me quickly lifted his brown head, and spying me gave 
his signal — how, I could not guess, for not a sound was uttered; 
but all the dancers stretched their little necks an instant and sped 
away. In a moment the ground was cleared and the dancers 
came not back." 

— Mrs. A. S. Hardy, in Birds and all Nature. 

PROTECT THE BIRDS. 

Now that spring has come again and the birds have returned 
with their songs, bringing much joy and gladness, there ought 
to be a strong effort put fonh in every school to interest the 
boys and girls in their care and protection. The boy with his 
gun and thousands of other boys with the death dealing "flip" 
are the greatest enemy the song birds have to contend against 
in their efforts to raise a family of sweet singers. Mary 
Morrison's poem, "Only a Bird," is only too true of so many 
boys. The girls, however, need these lessons almost as much 
as the boys. If they continue to wear the heads or wings of any 
of these birds on their hats the boys will feel that they are 
privileged to kill them. Of course the teacher who gives these 
lessons must be blameless in this matter and practice what is 
taught. — American "Journal of Education.

ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF ARBOR DAY. 

Whenever any cause, either in the field of economics or 
aesthetics, is taken up by the teachers and made part of the education 
of the pupils of the common schools of the United States, 
it is assuredly on the safest and best roads to ultimate triumph. 
Arboriculture and forestry are made prominently attractive and 
irresistibly alluring by successive celebrations of Arbor Day in 
all the schools of nearly all the counties of nearly all the States 
of the American Union. This anniversary has already evolved a 
vast amount of literature as to the beauty and value of trees and 
forests. Entertaining and instructive pamphlets and books upon 
this subject are found in nearly every village, in thousands of 
schoolhouses, in vast numbers of public libraries, and in many 
American homes. These writings are developing both the 
aesthetic and economic value of tree planting, and more arboriculture 
in the United States can be traced to Arbor Day and its 
proper celebration than to any and all other causes. 

In a republic forestry cannot be forced upon the people as it 
may be by the edicts of monarchy in some European states. A 
system of forest-forcing by governmental agencies cannot be 
made successful in the United States. But tree planting and forestry 
may be made so popular in American schools, and woodlands 
proved to be so important to the welfare of our race in this 
and succeeding generations, that the best class of citizenship will, 
in the near future, enthusiastically advocate and practically 
advance and exalt them. Thus fervid zeal in behalf of the woodlands 
and the forests will at last become, by communal heredity, 
an American trait. Only under the inspiration of a love of nature 
and trees, which may be intensified by the educational system of 
the country, may we hope for useful and practical forest conservation. 
That educational system may also develop a patriotic </seg>

American scheme for planting out new forests. Sooner or later 
text-books on arboriculture and forestry will be used in the 
common schools. Half the sum of money which has already 
been expended by the division of forestry of the United States 
Department of Agriculture in timber testing and in impractical 
experimentation would secure elementary school books enough 
on arboriculture and forestry to supply the United States for

THE BRAVE OLD OAK. 

A song to the oak, the brave old oak, 
Who hath ruled in the greenwood long; 

Here's health and renown to his broad green crown, 
And his fifty arms so strong. 

There's fear in his frown when the sun goes down, 
And the fire in the west fades out: 

And he showeth his might, on a wild midnight, 
When the storms through his branches shout. 

Then here's to the oak, the brave old oak, 
Who stands in his pride alone: 

And still flourish he, a hale, green tree, 
When a hundred years are gone. 

In the days of old, when the spring with cold 
Had brightened his branches gray, 

Through the grass at his feet crept maidens sweet 
To gather the dew of May; 

And on that day, to the rebeck gay 
They frollicked with lovesome swains; 

They are gone, they are dead, in the churchyard laid, 
• But the tree, it still remains. 

Then here's to the oak, the brave old oak, 
Who stands in his pride alone: 

And still flourish he, a hale old tree, 
When a hundred years are gone. 

He saw the rare times when the Christmas chimes 
Were a merry sound to hear, 

When the squire's wide hall and the cottage small 
Were filled with good English cheer. 

Now gold hath the sway we all obey, 
And a ruthless king is he; 

But he never shall send our ancient friend 
To be tossed on the stormy sea. </seg>

You're such a funny preacher,

Pray, do you think your sermons 
Are doing any good? 

The little frisky fairies

Would never list a sermon, 
Nor would the birds and bees. 

The ants, perhaps, might listen, 
They are so wise and queer; 

But wouldn't it be funny 
To see them all appear! 

Then there's old Grandpa Longlegs; 
He'd do to sit and frown, 

If Butterfly or Lady Bug 
Just come to show a gown. 

The squirrels, giddy creatures, 
Would never care a straw, 

Nor would they know the meaning 
Of any wholesome law. 

The spiders are too busy, 
The rabbits too afraid, 

And such a host of winged things 
Prefer the sun to shade! 

But then, dear Little preacher, 
One never knows the good 

That e'en a voiceless sermon 
May do within the wood.

WOOD WARBLERS. 

Very prominent among the birds of Nebraska are the Wood 
Warblers. These are small, slender, brightly hued creaturesthat 
have been described in the following words by that pleasing 
writer, Dr. Elliott Coues:* "The warblers have we always 
with us, all in their own good time; they come out of the south, 
pass on, return, and are away again, their appearance and withdrawal 
scarcely less than a mystery; many stay with us all summer 
long, and some brave the winters in our midst. Some of 
these slight creatures, guided by unerring instinct, travel true to 
the meridian in the hours of darkness, slipping past like a 'thief 
in the night,' stopping at daybreak from their lofty flights to rest 
and recruit for the next stage of the journey. Others pass more 
leisurely from tree to tree, in a ceaseless tide of migration, gleaning 
as they go; the hardier males, in full song and plumage, lead 
the way for the weaker females and the yearlings. With tireless 
industry do the warblers befriend the human race; their unconscious 
zeal plays due part in the nice adjustment of Nature's 
forces, helping to bring about the balance of vegetable and insect 
life without which agriculture would be in vain. They visit the 
orchard when the apple and pear, the peach, plum, and cherry

are in bloom, seeming to revel carelessly amid the sweet-scented 
and delicately-tinted blossoms, but never faltering in their good 
work. They peer into the crevices of the bark, scrutinize each 
leaf, and explore the very heart of the buds, to detect, drag forth 
and destroy those tiny creatures, singly insignificant, collectively 
a scourge, which prey upon the hopes of the fruit-grower, and 
which, if undisturbed, would bring his care to naught. Some 
warblers flit incessantly in the terminal foliage of the tallest trees; 
others hang close to the scored trunks, and gnarled boughs of 
the forest kings; some peep from the thicket, coppice, the 
impenetrable mantle of shrubbery that decks tiny water- courses, 
playing at hide-and-seek with all comers; others more humble 
still, descend to the ground, where they glide with pretty, mincing 
steps and affected turning of the head this way and that, their 
delicate flesh-tinted feet just stirring the layer of withered leaves 
with which a past season carpeted the ground. We may seek 
warblers everywhere in the season; we shall find them a continual 
surprise; all mood and circumstance is theirs." 

THE FAMILY OF FINCHES, SPARROWS, GROSBEAKS, ETC 

Our sparrows and their allies, taken together, form a very 
extensive family of very beautiful as well as useful birds. Like 
the warblers, they occupy themselves with searching for and 
destroying insects; but this is not all they do that is good. In 
fall, winter and early spring, when Mother Earth has lost her brilliant 
green and rests in sombre browns or beneath ice and snow, 
the longspurs, snow buntings, snowbirds and some of the sparrows 
that have remained with us, are busily engaged in gathering 
for themselves a living. They hop and fly about from place to 
place searching for and picking up little seeds of grass, grain, 
and weeds, of shrubs and trees, and appropriating the same to. 
their use, chirping merrily as they work away.

A robin who had flown too high, 

And felt a little lazy, 

Was resting near this buttercup 

Who wished she were a daisy. 

For daisies grow so trig and tall; 

She always had a passion 

For wearing frills around her neck 

In just the daisies' fashion. 

And buttercups must always be 
The same old tiresome color, 

While daisies dress in gold and white, 
Although their gold is duller. 

''Dear robin" said this sad young flower, 
"Perhaps you'd not mind trying 

To find a nice white frill for me 
Some day, when you are flying?' 

"You silly thing," the robin said, 
"I think you must be crazy. 

I'd rather be my honest self 
Than any made-up daisy. 

"You're nicer in your own bright gown, 
The little children love you: 

Be the best buttercup you can, 
And think no flower above you. 

"Though swallows leave me out of sight, 
We'd better keep our places. 

Perhaps the world would all go wrong 
Were there too many daisies.

And be content with knowing

AS ONE OF THESE. 

The poet wandered through the village street, 
Alone, among familiar sights and sounds; 
Alone, as poets are among the mass 

Of humankind; none noticed him, or if 
They did, with comic sidelong glance 

They said "The poet!" for their well-trained minds 
Recked not of foolish rhyming, or its cause. 

Alone, but well content. Within his soul 
A thousand harmonies were stirring, for 

The spring was whispering, in the woods and lanes, 
Her promises of bloom and verdure sweet. 
And tender grass crept up the southern slopes, 
Like foam from summer's hidden wave of green. 

His glowing thoughts, writ carelessly, had seemed 
To have some value, as he read them o'er, 
But no one cared to read them, hinting that 
"Spring poetry" was cheap, and common too. 
Spring seemed a time more fit to buy and sell, 
And do the many careful, humdrum things 
That thrifty folks must do, than wander around 
And read and write of trees, and brooks and grass. 

Sadly he pondered on the narrow life 

Of those whose hearts could feel no answering thrill, 
When Nature sang to them from throats of birds, 
Or from her wind-swept harps, the budding trees. 
Was he alone the audience that heard, 

In hushed and trembling rapture, Nature's thrilling voice? 
He longed, he prayed, for strong compelling words, 
That he might wake them to the sight and Bound 

Of the swift passing beauty of the spring. 
How dared they feel no wonder, that the year 
Had cast aside her burial shroud of white, 
And, emblem of a holier awakening, 

Now lived resplendent, to make glad the earth? 
Was it not meant for him, this mission rare? 
Should he not speak, if haply he could find 
Some word to make them heed and understand? 

Yet he was wrong: for many a heart grew light, 
And took fresh hope with the young growing year, 
And busy men, in shops or at the forge, 

Longed for a holiday, and dreamed of hill and stream:

STATE SUPERINTENDENT S REPORT. 

Leaving the street, the poet's random course 
Took him across a little rustic bridge. 
And up the opposite hill, where grand old trees 
Held out their arms, and welcomed him, their friend 
4 'Ah, yes! Ye slept awhile your quiet sleep 

In frost and snow, and now ye are awake: 
Your quiet useful life now groeth on, 
As all life doth, e'en though we sleep awhile. 

Perhaps thou knowest. or the bluebird there, 
Lining her nest so warm, in thy strong arms, 
The secret that has puzzled man for aye 
And will, while yet the race endures on earth, — 
The secret of this life we guard and keep — 
Thou, and the bird, and I, and all that live? 
What is there at the end, the end of all? 
What plan, what purpose do we help fulfill, 
That all so love their lives, and love to rear 
Their little ones, to keep the tide of life 
Flowing and widening, on its journey — where?" 

Thus, sunk in reverie, forgetting e'en 

The giant oak, that may (ah, well, who knows? 
Have known, and wished to answer, he became 
Aware of voices near him, clear and sweet. 
The children! As of old, when Hamlin's babes, 
-Charmed by the piper, came, a merry band, 
Laughing and dancing to the music's note. 
So now, these tiny folks came trooping on, 
With joy and Iwe and light in every glance, 
-Charmed by the music of the little stream, 
And of the birds o'er head. 

The poet smiled, 

And watched them from bis place, awhile unseen. 
Some knelt beside the mossy bank, and searched 
For violets, some sailed their mimic boats: 
Some ran for pure delight upon the grass, 
Or, roughishly, a pebble flung, and caused 

A dire destruction of the tiny fleet. 
Discovered by a little maid, whos- eyes 
Were keener than her friends, the poet came 
And sat upon the railing of the bridge. 
And one, whose hands were full of violets, 
Came to him, and with childhood's innocent grace 
Offered 'to him a share: then others came; 

One brought a curious pebble: and another 
A bird's nest, cold and empty now. and old,

Which she had not forgotten: for above. 
The busy weaver flitted to and fro, 
Forming another for a younger brood. 

One little lad had found a strange brown seed 
Just sprouting; and another, tenderly, 

Had brought a folded baby fern, and all 
Rained questions on the poet, thick and fast. 

Earnest and long he talked, and eager eyes 
And listening ears drank in the wondrous words. 
More wonderful than any fairy tale. 

How, in a strange past age, the pebble's form 
Was rounded by the icy glacier's tread; 
And how the nest, so thick and coarse without, 
So smooth and line within, showed mother-love 
And care: and how the little sprouting seed 
Had tried its best to do its humble part 
And, queer magician that it was, to change 
The dull soil into gleaming petals white! 
While speaking of the fern, the little lad 
Who brought it, told them of a poem rare 
Which he had read at home; how, long ago 
A little fern was caught and hidden deep 
And lost for ages in the hardening soil 
Until at last a ''thoughtful man" had found 
The imprint on its rocky bed; the fern 

Had vanished. 

But the level yellow light 

Had warned them of the passing of the day, 
So, not without a ling'ring, backward look, 
The poet, with the children at his side. 
Or pressing close behind, walked slowly home. 

That night the poet, in his easy chair, 
Reviewed the day, its pleasure and its pain — 
Pleasure to find the sympathy he craved 
In tnese pure little souls; and pain, because 
In his exalted mood, he had not seen 
That in each home where little children dwell, 
Or where they have dwelt, or have e'er been loved, 
Nature is loved, though days of busy care 
May cause neglect, which she, sweet soul, forgives. 

Where, then, his mission? Crumbled into dust? 
Not so; he needs must speak the more assured 
Of wider fellowship; for now he understood 
The words "Except as ye become as one 

Of these, ye shall in nowise enter in 

My kingdom." E'en the kingdom here on earth! </seg>

THE FIRST SNOWDROP. 

"I want to get up," the snowdrop said, 
As she loosened the wraps about her head: 
"It may be the world is white with snow, 
Yet I'd rather be there than here below. 
'Tis horrid to be curled up so tight — 
I want to look out and see the light. 

"My dear little sisters are fast asleep, 
And I am the first to take a peep 
Out of my bed, where, snugly rolled, 
I slept in warm blankets, fold on fold. 
But now I am ever so wide awake, 
And it's surely time for the morn to break. 

"My dress is the prettiest e'er was seen: 
'Tis white, with an oversbirt of green, 
With six pretty silken cords that hold 
As many tiny tassels of gold. 

Oh, I've been workiDg, never fear, 
To look my best when I do appear. 

"And I must welcome the song birds home, 
There seems to be such a stirring all around, 
And I hear new voices above the ground. 
The buds on the willows are calling, 'Come:' 
For this is the message they bring, I guess, 
'Get up, little maid; it is time to dress.'"

NEBRASKA ORNITHOLOGISTS' UNION. 

The Nebraska Ornithologists' Union is comprised of those 
persons who live in Nebraska and who are especially interested 
in the bird-life of the State. The aims of this society are 
several. Among these may be mentioned the study of our birds 
with a view to ascertaining more about their distribution, 
migrations, nesting and breeding, food habits, variations with 
reference to locality, etc. ; their protection from the onslaught 
of their enemies, including man; and to further the general 
knowledge of these creatures by aiding the teachers in our </seg>

public schools to present the subject to their pupils in an attractive 
manner. 

There are two grades of members, viz., active and associate. 
The former comprise that class of persons who are, as the name 
implies, active in studying birds from a systematic or economic 
standpoint — those in fact who would be termed "ornithologists." 
The associate members are those who in any way take an 
interest, active or passive, in the bird life about them either from 
pleasure or out of sympathy. 

The Union intends to publish proceedings. This volume is to 
be composed of papers or abstracts of such papers as are read 
at the annual meetings; tables for the determination of the 
orders, families, and species, by means of which our various 
birds can be named; synopses of the species of an order, family 
or genus; write-up of particular birds, in which will be considered 
such facts as distribution, migration, food habits, care of 
young, change of plumage, etc. The first volume is now in the 
hands of the printer. In order to make all this possible it will be 
necessary to raise considerable money. As the fees are only 
$1.00 for active, and fifty cents for associate members annually, 
the membership will have to be quite large. Teachers can 
become associate members by the payment of fifty cents. 
Since all members are entitled to the publications of the Union, 
there will be ample return for the investment in addition to 
helping to advance a good cause. 

It is also the aim of the organization to prepare within two or 
three years a manual of the birds of Nebraska and surrounding 
regions suitable for use in the public schools. 

Membership fees should be sent to the treasurer, Prof. Lawrence 
Bruner, University of Nebraska,

God's happy children of the air 
On leafy boughs are swaying, 

While beings fair with forms divine 
Are in the churches praying. 

Cathedral grand with vaulted skies 
The songs of birds are filling; 

The wide extended plains of heaven. 
Are with their rapture thrilling. 

They chant the anthems of their God 
And worship Him with singing: 

Who listens to their songs may hear 
The chime? of heaven a-ringing. 

In divers notes of sweetest tone 
Their lays to us come stealing: 

They seem to draw us to the skies, 
While in our pews we're kneeling 

We bow before the Lord in prayer, 
Oar love to him expressing;

From bough to bough, from tree to tree, 
The birds, no longer flitting, 
All bruised and crushed and cold and dead 

On ladies' hats are sitting. 

Their songs without now never heard, 
The mi nslrels dead or dying: 

Within the sinners, vain with pride, 
Their God to praise are trying. 

They sing aloud their hymns of praise, 

And think that God is hearing, 

While on their shapeless hats in truth 
Five million birds they're wearing. 

And now no chirping music wild 
On airy wings is swelling; 
The voiceless birds to church have gone 
To find an alien dwelling. 

Methinks could all these lifeless birds 

Our hearts with song be filling, 
A plaintive voice to us would say, 

'Why don't you stop this killing?" 
An answer bold in haste is made, 

"What cares a bird for living ?' 
Just this, dear friend, to live the life 

That God to it is giving. 

No tearful voice, no whispered song, 
Can end without His knowing: 

Spare, then, the birds whose songs do set 

The world to music going.

NATURE AND THE CHILDREN. AN ARBOR DAY EXERCISE. 

Decorate the stage with bare boughs, branches of pine, fur 
and spruce and a tall clock with the hands set at half past 
twelve, and the word April in large letters across its face. 

Nature wears a wreath of green leaves, and a green flowersprinkled 
dress. She carries a broom and appears to be sweeping 
and cleaning away last year's leaves and the winter's snow. 
(Represent snow by cotton.) 

The Rain wears gray; the Sun, yellow; Bluebird, blue. 

The children carry branches of trees.

I haven't a minute to spare, not one, 
For my spring-time work is but just begun. 
North Wind is prowling around my door, 
Growling and blustering o'er and o'er. 
What's to be done with the ice and snow, 
Unless he leaves me, I'd like to know? 
The flowers are locked in the frozen ground. 
Not one will stir while he is around. 

(Goes to the window and calls.) 
South Wind! South Wind! hurry along, 
And call here the Bluebirds to sing me a song. 
Rain and Sunshine, come do your part: 
'Tis time for the grasses green to start, 
For 'tie half past' twelve by April's clock!

Hark! outside did I hear a knock? 
(South Wind peeps in at the door.) 

South Wmd— 

Did you call me, Mother Nature? 

Nature (throws down broom and runs to welcome her.) — 
Yes, yes, my child. Come in ! Come in ! You are late, but 

never mind, we^ll soon have things in order now that you 
are here. 

South Wind— 

Yes, I know I am late, but it is all the fault of that blustering 
old North Wind. He tried to coax me to let him stay 
a while longer, and when I refused, he was so angry he 
almost took my breath away, and I was quite afraid of him. 

But here I am at last; and now tell me what you wish me 
to do. 

Nature- 

Go to the woods and in bright array, 
Dress all the trees for Arbor Day. 
Tell old Winter his place to keep; 
Bid the flowers awake from sleep: 
Waken the butterflies, bugs and bees; 
Put the catkins upon the trees;— 
In short, my dear, do everything 

That will say to the world, '"Tis spring! 'Tis spring!'

Everything whispers that spring has come.

Fair Is the canopy 

That the cups which they carry 
Are purple with wine; 

And the columbines bravely 
As sentinels stand 

Over him seen, 

Penciled by Nature's hand, 
Black, brown, and green. 
Green is his surplice, 

On the lookout with all their 
Red trumpets in hand.

THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. 

What do the robins whisper about 
From their homes in the elms and birches? 

I've tried to study the riddle out, 

But still in my mind is many a doubt, 
In spite of deep researches. 

While over the world is silence deep, 
In the twilight of early dawning. 

They begin to chirp and twitter and peep, 

As if they were talking in their sleep, 
At three o'clock in the morning. 

Perhaps the little ones stir and complain 
That it's time to be up and doing: 
And the mother-bird sings a drowsy strain 
To coax them back to their dreams again, 
Though distant cocks are crowing. 

Or do they tell secrets that should not be heard 
By mortals listening and prying? 

Perhaps we might learn from some whispering word. 

The best way to bring up a little bird — 
Of the wonderful art of flying. 

It may be that they speak of an autumn day, 
When with many a feathered roamer, 

Under the clouds so cold and gray, 

Over the hill they take their way, 
In search of the vanished summer. 

It may be they gossip from nest to nest, 
Hidden and leaf-enfolded, 

For we do not often hear it confessed. 

When a long-kept secret at last is guessed, 
That "a little bird has told it." 

Perhaps — but the question is wrapped in doubt, 
They give me no hint or warning. 

Listen, and tell me if you find out 
What do the robins talk about 

At three o'clock In the morning

sl'KCIAL DAYS. 

THE LITTLE DOVES. 

High on the top of an old pine tree 

Broods a mother-dove with her young one* three. 
Warm over them is her soft, downy breast, 
And they sing so sweetly in their nest. 

"Coo," say the little ones, "Coo," says she, 
All in their nest on the old pine tree. 

Soundly they sleep through the moonshiny night, 
Each young covered and tucked in tight; 
Morn wakes them up with the first blush of light, 
And they sing to each other with all their might. 
"Coo," say the little ones, "Coo," says she, 

All in their nest on the old pine tree. 

When in their nest they are all left alone, 
While their mother far for their dinner has flown. 
Quiet and gentle they all remain, 

Till their mother they see come home again. 
Then "Coo," say ths little ones, "Coo," s»ys she, 
All in their nest on the old pine tree. 

When they are fed by their tender mother, 
One never pushes nor crowds another; 
Each opens wide his own little bill, 
And he patiently waits, and gets his fill. 
Then "Coo," say the little ones, "Coo," says she, 
All in their nest on the old pine tree. 

Wisely the mother begins by and by, 
To make her young ones learn to fly, 
Just for a little way over the brink, 
Then back to the nest as quick as wink. 
And "Coo," say the little ones, "Coo," says she. 
All in their nest on the old pine tree. 

Fast grow the young ones, day and night, 
Till their wings are plumed for a longer flight: 
Till unto them at last draws nigh 

The time when they must all say "Goodby." 
Then "Coo," say the little ones, "Coo," says she, 
And away they fly from the old pine tree.

THE MOSS ROSE. 

The ange of the flowers, one day, 
Beneath a rose tree sleeping lay- 
That spirit to whose charge 'tis given 
To bathe youcg buds in dews of heaven: 
Awaking from his light repose. 

The angel whispered to the rose: 
"O fondest object of my care. 
Still fairest found, where all are fair: 
For the sweet shade thou giv'st to me. 
Ask what thou wilt, 'tis granted thee. 
'"Then," said the rose, with deepened glow, 
'¦On me another grace bestow.'' 

The spirit paused in silent thought — 
What grace was there that flower had not ? 
'Twas but a moment — o'er the rose 

A veil of moss the angel throws : 
And, robed in Nature's simplest weed. 
Could there a flower that rose exceed ?

LIFE IN THE FOREST BIRDS. 

(Extract from an article published in "Nature and Art."") 

When man disturbs the harmony of action in Nature, 

retribution is sure. , .This has proved true in the case of 

wholesale destruction of the birds o£ the forest and field. 

Europe, Asia, Africa, America — each has waged a war 

selfishness and ignorance upon the feathered tribe. Each 

gained his experience at great cost to itself, for in the end </seg>

•SPECIAL DAYS. 

birds have been the victors. Their birthright is gradually being 
given back to them, willingly or unwillingly, by every nation. 

Gaye tells us in "The Great World's Farm " how Germany, 
anxious to devote all her available land to crop-raising, sacrificed 
her forests and hedges, and ordered her government keepers to 
destroy all birds which sought food in the cultivated fields. 
Thus the birds were killed or left homeless, and the survivors 
were driven further and further from civilization. 

But they were avenged. The grubs and injurious insects, 
deprived of the leaves of the wild shrub and tree, easily contented 
themselves with a new kind of food — the leaves of the 
cultivated plants. As they were freed from their natural enemies, 
the birds, they prospered and increased accordingly. Man 
found the government keepers powerless in this case. They 
had no weapons to cope with an enemy which multiplied daily 
by the thousands. Some of the most harmful of these insects 
have a progeny about equal to that of the common house-fly, 
which has (or would have, if all were allowed to live) about 
21,000,000 descendants- in a single summer. 

The Sicilian persecution of the birds is another example in 
this same line. Until steps were taken to prevent it, millions of 
small, insect-loving birds, as larks, swallows, etc., as they stopped 
there to rest on their journeys to and from Europe, were killed 
upon this island every year for mere sport. 1 

So we might go on giving the bird history of India, France, 
Prussia, or the United States, but we would find little neW in the 
story. In each case the birds were slaughtered for sport, for 
personal adornment, or for their imputed wrong-doing.- 

It was only when it was discovered that in direct proportion 
to the loss of the birds came myriads of destructive insects and 
almost certain crop famine that measures were adopted for their 
protection. But man has found that he cannot with impunity 
interfere with the wise provisions of Nature. If undisturbed, 
all is mutual dependence, and there is no deficiency, no superfluity; 
but it is in such lessons as these that we discover the law, 
the nice balance of the universe. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

For several years scientists have had ready convincing defenses 
of the birds, but few would hear them until experience taught 
people to listen. The tales of those witnesses are indeed marvelous, 
yet each has statistics gathered from actual observation. 

One tells us that in the stomachs of four chickadees were found 
1,028 eggs of the cankerworm, and goes on to show how, at this 
rate, in the twenty-five days which the moths of the cankerworms 
crawl up the lrees, that every average chickadee would 
destroy 138,750 eggs of this noxious insect. 

Another says: The cuckoo eats all day long, and devours daily 
about 170 good-sized caterpillars, each of which, if allowed to 
reach the butterfly state, might lay 500 eggs; thus each cuckoo 
rids us of a possible 85,000 caterpillars daily. 

Again, it is said that the sparrows eat about 354,375,000,000 
caterpillars every year, while only for three months do they 
insist upon a vegetable diet. Yet these laborers are never considered 
worthy of their hire, and their slight portion of the corn 
is always begrudged them. 

The economic value of birds to the forests and of the forests 
to the birds is equally well established. Trees and shrubs are 
absolutely necessary to many kinds of birds. One realizes this 
when he comes to a small, quiet grove in a prairie country. 
The trees in such places are literally covered with nests of all 
sizes and descriptions. 

In the U. S. Agricultural Report, May, 1897, Beal says: "To 
the woodpeckers more than to any other agency we owe the 
preservation of our timber from hordes of destructive insects." 

Many ants are particularly harmful to wood, for often, having 
found a small spot of decay, they completely honeycomb the 
entire trunk of a tree. These insects would be unmolested in 
their damaging work were it not for the woodpeckers, creepers 
and nuthatches, for to all other animals they are inaccessible. 

Among the true forest birds there is a wonderful harmony of 
action. The thrushes, the warblers, the woodpeckers, the creepers, 
nuthatches and vireos — each finds by instinct his plane in 
life, that best suited to his structure and tastes ; so that in every 
well regulated forest there is a proportioned plan of food-getting

•which human beings might well observe. Of course, what the 
insects might say of the plan would be "Another long story." 

In "Bird Life," Carpenter gives us an attractive description of 
the birds at work. It is in part as follows : 

"In the air swallows and swifts are coursing rapidly to and 
fro, ever in pursuit of the insects which constitute their sole 
food. When they retire, the nighthawk and whip-poor-wills 
will take up the chase, catching moths and other nocturnal insects 
which would escape day-flying birds. 

"Fly-catchers lie in wait, darting from ambush at passing prey ; 
the warblers flutter about the terminal foliage, and with almost 
the skill of a hummingbird, pick insects from the leaf or blossom. 

"The vireos patiently explore the under sides of leaves and 
odd nooks and corners to see that no skulker escapes. 

"The woodpeckers, nuthatches and creepers attend to the 
trunks and limbs, while on the ground the hunt is continued by 
the thrushes, sparrows and other birds that feed upon the innumerable 
forms of terrestrial insects. Few places in which insects 
exist are neglected." 

But there are many other witnesses who have tried to vindicate 
the birds, and there is no better plea from the economic 
standpoint than Longfellow's in "The Birds of Killingsworth." 
Only a part of the schoolmaster's entreaty can be quoted here : 

"Think of your woods and orchards without birds, 
Of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams 

As, in an idiot's brain, remembered words 
Hang empty 'mid the cobwebs of his dreams! 

Will bleat of flocks or bellowing of herds 
Make up for the lost music, when your teams 

Drag home the stingy harvest, and no more 
The feathered gleaners follow to your door ? 

"What! would you rather see the incessant stir 
Of Insects in the windrows of the hay, 

And hear the locust and the grasshopper 
Their melancholy hurdy-gurdies play? 

Is this more pleasant to you than the whir 
Of the meadow-lark and her sweet roundelay, 

Or twitter of the little fieldfares, as you take 
Your nooning in the shade of bush or brake? </seg>

state superintendent's report. 

"You call them thieves and pillagers, but know 

They are the winged wardens of your farms, 
Who from the cornfields drive the insidious foe. 

And from your harvests keep a hundred harms. 
Even the blackest of them all, the crow, 

Renders good service as your man-at-arms, 

Crushing the beetle in his coat of mail, 
And crying havoc on the slug and snail " 

But it is in comparatively recent times that their utilitarian 
necessity to man has caused the protection of the birds. 

Poets, philosophers, artists, and scientists — great men in every 
age have studied and appreciated them. The oldest picture in 
the werld, painted in Egypt three thousand years before Christ, 
is a picture of six geese, two of which will be recognized as 
belonging to species well known at the present day. Birds 
appear in the early picture-writing as symbols of grace, power 
and fleetness, and occupy a large place in all our literature and 
mythology. 

Aristotle, the great philosopher and scientist, who lived 300 
B. C, is the first ornithologist whose writings have come 
down to us. He tells us, however, that he had predecessors. 
As we look at the great amount of work that he did in other 
lines, we can but wonder how he found time to name and 
describe for us 170 of the birds of Greece. With him, systematic 
bird study began, and now there is scarcely a bird 
whose every bone and feather has not been carefully measured 
and described. 

Happily for us, except in rare instances, we need not destroy 
the birds in order to classify them. That great work has been 
already done. We have only to go out into the fields and forests 
and enjoy them. But to really enjoy them, we must know them. 
I believe it will some time be considered a greater ignorance not 
to know the birds at our doors than not to be familiar with the 
writings of Shakespeare and Homer. When the birds have 
become our intimate friends, their habits, emotions, wonderful 
ways of nest-building, and their care of their young become 
sources of never-ending delight, and we then take a personal 
pride and joy in each beauty, grace, or musical power which 
they possess. </seg>

It was not their use that stirred the great heart of Leonardo 
De Vinci, who, while he painted one of the three greatest of the 
world's pictures, "The Last Supper," yet found time to go daily 
to the market-place of Milan, that he might buy and set free 
the prisoned birds. Here is part of the story set in rhyme : 

"He used to go, 
This painter of whom I'll have you know, 

Down to the market where they sold 
Cages of birds all gay with gold, 

Crimson and blue on wings and crest, 
Trapped and stolen from many a nest; 

Thither he wandered day by day, 
Buying each cage within his way — 

Making the hearts of the peasants glad 
Since they could sell him all they had. 

Nor did it matter what his store, 
Still he was always buying more. 

"Why did he want so many? Well, 
That is just what I am going to tell. 
Instantly, soon as he bought a bird, 
Over his up-turned head was heard, 

Oh, such a trill — so glad, so high, 

Dropping right out of the sunny sky 
Into his heart as naught else could, 

Filling it full, as there he stood, 
Holding the open wicker door, 

Watching with joy the bright wings soar 
Into the blue! You know why! he 
Wanted them only to set them free." 

— Wide Awake. 

Longfellow tells how Emperor Charles of Spain once, during 
a siege of Flanders, protected a swallow and her brood. The 
swallow came and built her nest above the emperor's tent, and 
he gave the order that no one should molest her. 

"Lo, unharmed and unafraid, 
Sat the swallow still and brooded, 
Till the constant canonade 

Through the walls a breach had made 
And the siege was thus concluded. 

"Then the army, elsewhere bent, 
Struck its tents, as if disbanding; 

Only not the emperor's tent, 
For he ordered, e're he went, 

Very curtly, 'Leave it standing'.' </seg>

"So it stood there all alone, 

Loosely flapping, torn and tattered, 
Till the brood was fledged and flown, 
Singing o'er the walls of stone 
Which the cannon shot had shattered." 

Thus we might go on, and with story and myth show how 
deeply, in all times, the birds have taken hold of the human 
heart and imagination. But the same birds that have been the 
source of so much inspiration are singing in our forests and 
fields, and it is the great privilege of every boy and girl to see 
and know them for themselves.

AN EASTERN LEGEND. 

There's a tender eastern legend, 
In a volume old and rare, 

Of the Christ-child in his garden 
Walking with the children there. 

And it tells — this strange, sweet story— 
(True or false, ah, who shall say?) 

How a bird with a broken pinion 
There within the garden lay. 

And the children, childish, cruel, 
Lifted it by shattered wing, 

Shouting, "Make us merry music, 
Sing, you lazy fellow, sing." 

But the Christ-child bent above it, 
Took it in His gentle hand. 

Pull of pity for the suffering, 
He alone could understand. 

Whispered to it — oh, so softly! 
Laid his lips upon its throat, 

And the song-life, swift returning, 
Sounded out in one glad note. 

Then away, on wings unwearied, 
Joyously it sang and soared, 

And the little children kneeling, 

Called the Christ-child, "Master— Lord. 1 '

THE FRIGHTENED BIRDS. 

"Hush! huah!" said the little brown thrush 
To her mate on the nest in the alder-bush: 
''Keep still! don't open your bill, 

There's a boy coming bird-nesting over the hill. 
Let go your wings out, so 

That not an egg or the nest shall show. 
Chee! chee! it seems to me 

I'm as frightened as ever a bird can be." 

Then still, with a quivering bill, 

They watched the boy out of sight o'er the hill, 
Ah. then, in the branches again 

Their glad song rang over vale and glen, 
Oh! oh! if that boy could know 

How glad they were they saw him go, 
Say, so do you think next day 

He could possibly steal those eggs away?

THE CATBIRD. 

He sits on a branch of yon blossoming tree, 
This mad-cap cousin of robin and thrush, 

And sings without ceasing the whole morning long; 
Now wild, now tender, the wayward song 

That Hows from his soft, gray, fluttering throat; 
But often he stops in his sweetest note, 

And shaking a Sower from the blossoming bough, 
Drawls out, "Mi-ow, mi-ow!"

HISTORIC TREES. 

I. CHARTER OAK. 

In history we often see 
The record of a noted tree. 

We'll now some history pages turn 
And note what trees we there discern: 
And foremost of this famous band 
We think the Charter Oak should stand. 
We love to read the story o'er, 

How Andrus came from England's shore 
As governor in this new land, 

And ruled it with a tyrant's hand: 
How, when he came to Hartford town 
Demanding with a haughty frown 
The charter of the people's rights, 
All suddenly out went the lights; 
And, e'er again they reappeared, </seg>

Guard of the people's liberty. 

All honor, then, to WadswortVs name, 
Who gave the Charter Oak its fame. 

II. LIBERTY ELM. 

Another very famous tree 
Was called the Elm of Liberty. 
Beneath its shade the patriots bold 
For tyranny their hatred told. 
Upon its branches high and free 
Was often hung in effigy 

Such persons as the patriots thought 
Opposed the freedom which they sought. 
In wartime, oft beneath this tree 

The people prayed for victory: 
And when at last the old tree fell 
There sadly rang each Boston bell. 

III. WASHINGTON ELM. 

In Cambridge there is standing yet 
A tree we never should forget; 
For here, equipped with sword and gun, 
There stood our honored Washington, 
When of the little patriot band 

For freedom's cause he took command. 
Despite its age — three hundred years — 
Its lofty head it still uprears; 

Its mighty arms extending wide, 
It stands our country's boasted pride. 

IV. BDRGOYNE'S ELM. 

When, in spite of pride, pomp and boast. 
Burgoyne surrendered with his host, 
And then was brought to Albany 

A prisoner of war to be. 
In gratitude for his defeat, 
That day, upon the city street, 
An elm was planted, which they say 
Still stands in memory of that day. 

V. THE TREATY ELM.

Of sister poets, and is known 

As Alice and Phoebe Gary's own. 
One day, when little girls, they found 
A sapling lying on the ground:

Beside this pleasant highway, where 
It grew and thrived and lived to be

ROBBING A MOTHER. 

The aigrettes that we wear in our hats are the feathers from 
the back, called the dorsal feathers, of the white heron. They 
come only when the little mother bird is getting ready to build 
her nest and lay the eggs which she will care for so tenderly, 
that her little birds may help to make the world a more beautiful 
place. 

The hunters know they can get these feathers only when the 
mother heron is on her nest, and that she loves her babies so 
dearly that she will not leave her nest. Then the hunters shoot 
her, pluck her beautiful feathers, and leave the baby birds to 
starve and perish in the nest for want of care.

MATILDA ANN. 

I know a charming little girl, 
Who'd say, "Oh, see that flower!" 

Whenever in the garden 
Or woods she spent an hour. 

And sometimes she would listen. 
And say, "Oh, hear that bird!" 

Whenever in the forest 

Its clear, sweet note she heard. 

But then I know another — 
Much wiser, don't you think?— 

Who never called the bird a "bird, 
But said, "the bobolink," 

Or "oriole," or "robin," 
Or "wren," as it might be; 

She called them all by their first names, 
So intimate was she. 

And in the woods or garden, 
She never picked "a flower;" 

But "anemones," "hepaticas, 
Or "crocus, " by the hour. 

Both little girls loved birds and flowers, 
But one love was the best; 

I need not point the moral: 
I'm sure you see the rest. 

For would it not be very queer, 
If when, perhaps, you came, 

Your parents had not thought worth while 
To give you any name? 

I think you would be quite upset, 
And feel your brain a-whirl, 

If you were not "Matilda Ann," 

But just "a little girl." — Aliet W. Rollint. </seg>

AN APPEAL FOR THE BIRDS. 

O say, O say, can vou hear them, 
In forest and field and lane, 

The starving nestlings crying 
While the parent birds are slain'' 
Can you see the nests deserted, 

And the pretty eggs chilled o'er. 

And hear all Nature mourning 

For the birds that sing no more? 

O say, O say, can you see them. 
The songbirds we love to hear, 

Dying by hundreds and thousands, 
Perishing year by year? 

To the gaudy haunts of fashion 
We may trace their plumage gav, 

But their hearts that throbbed with musk- 
Have ceased to beat for aye. 

O songsters, beautiful songsters, 
Ye come and sing no more. 

Spring waits in vain for the carol 
That welcomed her coming of yore. 

But beware ! There is One who made them, 
Our birds with their voices sweet: 

And the cries of his dying songsters 
Ascend to His mercy seat '

No creature is more jealous or sensitive than a bird, says Olive 
Thorn Miller. It is easy, however, to win the heart of almost 
any bird, and without starving him or making him think he has 
mastered you. Simply talk to him a good deal. Place his cage 
near you, on your desk or work table, and retain his choicest 
dainty to give to him with your own fingers. Let him know 
that he can never have that particular thing unless he takes it 
from you, and he will soon learn, if you are patient and do not 
disconcert him by fixing your eyes upon him. After this he will 
more readily take it from your lips; and then when you let him 
out of his cage, after the first excitement is over, he will come to 
you, especially if you have a call you have accustomed him to, 
and accept the dainty from you while free. As soon as he 
becomes really convinced that you will not hurt him, or try to 
catch him, or interfere in any way with his liberty, he will give 
way to his boundless curiosity about you; he will pull your hair, 
pick at your «yes, and give you as much of his company as you 
desire. — Sel. 

A PRETTY GOWN. 

All the shop windows in town are full 
Of silk and cotton and gingham and wool, 
But none of them shows a gown so gay 
As the one Mrs. Humming Bird wears to-day. 
'Tis the very same fashion her grandmother wore, 
And hasn't a seam or pucker or gore: 

The sun doesn't fade it, the rain doesn't spot, 
And it's just the thing whether chilly or hot. 
'Tis a perfect fit, and it won't wear out, 
But will last her as long as she lives, no doubt. 

—Anna M. Pratt. 

PHCKBE. 

When skies are blue 
And threaded through 

With skeins of sunlight spangles, 
And breezes blow 

Quite soft and low 

Amid the tree-top tangles: 

When summer has the world in thrall 
And joy is sovereign over all, 

'Tis curious that a little bird 
Should utter such a wistful word 

As "Poor me! Poor me!" </seg>

BLUEBIRD. 

Listen a moment, I pray you! 

What was that sound 1 heard ? 

Wind in the budding branches, 

The ripple of brooks or a bird ? 

Hear it again, above us, 

And see, a flatter of wings! 
The Bluebird knows it is April, 

And soars to the sun and sings. 

Never the song of the Robin 
Could make my heart so glad: 

When I hear the Bluebird singing 
In spring, 1 forget to be sad. 

Never was sweeter music — 
Sunshine turned into song 

To set us dreaming of summer, 

When the days and the dreams are long. 

Winged lute that we call a Bluebird 
You blend in a silver strain 

The sound of the laughing waters, 
The patter of spring's sweet rain, 

The voice of the wind, the sunshine, 
And fragrance of blossoming thing's. 

Ah! you are a poem of April, 
That God endowed with wines.

The woodpecker flew to a maple limb, 
And drummed a tattoo that was fun for him. 
"No breakfast here ! It's too hard for that, " 
He said as down on his tail he sat. 

"Just listen to this: rrrr rat-tat-tat." 

Away to the pear tree, out of sight, 
With a cheery call and a jumping flight, 
He hopped around till he found a stub; 
"Ah, here's the place to look for a grub ! 
'Tis moist and dead — rrrr rub-dub-dub." 

To a branch of an apple tree Downy hied, 
And hung by his toes to the under aide. 
" 'Twill be sunny here in this hollow trunk: 
It's dry and soft with a heart of punk, 
Just the place for a rest — rrrr runk-tunk-tunk." 

"I see," said the boy. "Just a tap or two: 
Then listen as any bright boy might do. 
You can tell ripe melons and garden stuff 
In the very same way — it's easy enough."

INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT BIRDS. 

Sense of sight, smell, and hearing are remarkably acute in 
birds. This is especially true of sight. Some have three 
eyelids, the upper and lower and a membrane which can be 
drawn over the entire eyeball, called the nictitating membrane, 
enabling them to look directly at the sun. Eagles, hawks, and 
owls are thus provided. The eyes of the eagles and hawks are 
provided also with a ring of bony plates, by means of which the 
eye adjusts itself like a telescope, taking in both near and far 
objects. 

Birds, except nocturnal species, have no external ear, but hear 

well. 

The young of nest-building birds when born are blind, naked, 
and unable to walk. In the hen, the partridge, and the ducks, 
the young are able to walk, swim, or pick up food as soon as 
they break the shell. When moulting, at the close of the 
breeding season, quails usually shed in pairs. The male generally 
assumes a duller hued coat than the female. 

With most birds of prey the female is the larger. </seg>

8TATK SUPERINTENDENT'S KEPOKT. 

Birds' songs are composed of love-notes and pleasure notes. 
We speak of the scream of birds, their chirp, expression* of joy 
or fear, as in the human voice. Their songs can be set to music. 
See S. P. Cheney's "Wood Notes Wild," in which the songs of 
many of our common birds are thus reproduced. The odd and 
peculiar actions of birds, their dances, s ruts and posturings are 
all expressions of their emotions. 

The nesting habits of birds are varied. Gulls drop eggs on 
bare ground or rocks; the Baltimore oriole and tailor bird construct 
hanging nests of elaborate workmanship; the woodpecker 
hews out a deep nest in a rotten limb; the kingfisher digs one 
out of a sandy bank, while the cuckoo takes possession of the 
nest of some other bird. Most birds select nesting places away 
from other species, but swallows, English sparrows, grackles, 
and crows live in communities. 

There are between seven and eight thousand species of living 
birds. A few species have become extinct. 

There are three centers of distribution in the United States : 
(i) the Atlantic states and Mississippi valley; (2) the Rocky 
Mountain plateau; (3) the Pacific coast. 

Most of the birds breeding in the northern portions of the 
United States migrate south during the winter months. Those 
remaining are known as residents. — Birds. 

OVSi NEIGHBOR 

We've a charming new neighbor moved in the next door; 
He's hardly new either, he's lived there before: 
I should think he had come here two summers or more: 

His winters he spends far away. 

He is handsome and stylish, most fine to behold. 
In his glossy black coat and his vest of bright gold: 
He is "proud of his feathers," so I have been told, 

And I half believe what people say. 
His wife is a beauty, he's fond of her, too: 
He calls her his "Judy:" I like it, don't you? 

And he sings every day all the long summer through, 
Yet he is not a bit of a bore. 

For he's a musician of wonderful power: 
( could list to his beautiful voice by the hour, 
And he sings to his wife in their green, shady bower 

In the elm tree that shadows mv door. </seg>

Although we've not called yet, and cannot quite tell 
All he says, tho' his voice is as clear as a bell,

O sing in the morning a song that I love, 
A song that is sweet as the lark's above.

The fields and the woodlands are bright as a smile. 
The sky bends so tenderly, lovingly o'er us, 

With clouds o'er the hills like gray soldiers in file. 

How happy the winds are above and about us, 
They laugh out like children in innocent glee; 

Let the world and its sorrows go onward without us, 
O, summer, the summer for you and for me.

I killed a robin— the little thing, 
With scarlet breast on a glossy wing, 
That comes in the apple tree to sing. 

I tlung a stone as he twittered there . 
I only meant to give him a scare, 
But off it went— and hit him square. 

A little flutter— a little cry — 
Then on the ground I saw him lie. 
I didn't think he was going to die. 

But as I watched him I soon could «ee 
He never would sing for you or me 
Any more in the apple tree. 

Nevermore in the morning light, 
Nevermore in the sunshine bright, 
Thrilling his song in gay delight. </seg>

[For Quotation Exercise. 

The Union must be preserved. 

Fellow citizens, -jue cannot escape history. 

A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, 
its laws. 

I believe this Government cannot permanently endure 
slave and half free. 

No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those 
toil up from poverty. 

I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly 
events have controlled me. 

If our sense of duty forbid slavery, then let us stand by 
duty, fearlessly and effectively.

I hope peace will come soon and come to stay, and so come as 
to be worth the keeping in all future time. 

In giving freedom to the slaves we assure freedom to the free,, 
honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. 

Having thus chosen our course, without guile and with pure 
purpose, let us renew our trust in God and go forward without 
fear and with manty hearts. 

If this country cannot be saved without giving up the principles 
of Liberty, I was about to say I would rather be assassinated 
on this spot than surrender it. 

To sell or enslave any captured person on account of his color 
and for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into barbarism 
and a crime against the civilization of the age. 

Do not worry, eat three square meals a day, say your prayers, 
be courteous to your creditors, keep your digestion good, steer 
clear of biliousness, exercise, go slow and go easy. Maybe there 
are other things that your special case requires to make you 
happy, but, my friend, these I reckon will give you a good lift. 

Gold is good in its place; but living, patriotic men are better 
than gold. 

God must like common people or He would not have made somany. 


I am indeed very grateful to the brave men who have been 
struggling with the enemy in the field. 

This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people whoinhabit 
it. 

Let us have that faith that right makes might; and in that 
faith let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it. 

The reasonable man has long since agreed that intemperance 
is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of all evils among mankind. 


The purposes of the Almighty are perfect and must prevail,, 
though we erring mortals may fail to accurately perceive them, 
advance.

IN MEM0R1AM: ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 

MBS. IliILT J. BL'I.HII. 

There's a burden of grief on the breezes of spring, 
And a song- of regret from the bird on its wing: 
There's a pall on the sunshine and over the flowers. 
And a shadow of graves on these spirits of ours: 
For a star hath gone out from the night of our sky, 
On whose brightness we gazed as the war-cloud rolled by: 
So tranquil and steady and clear were its beams. 
That they fell like a vision of peace oo our dreams. 

A heart that we knew had been true to our weal, 
And a hand that waa steadily guiding the wheel: 
A name never tarnished by falsehood or wrong, 
That had dwelt in our hearts like a soul-stirring song: — 
Ah, that pure, noble spirit has gone to its rest, 
And the true hand lies nerveless and cold on his breast: 
But the name and the memory, these never will die, 
But grow brighter and dearer as ages go by. 

Yet the tears of a nation fall over the dead. 
Such tears as a nation before never shed: 
For our cherished one fell by a dastardly hand. 
A martyr to truth and the cause of the land: 
And a sorrow has surged, like the waves to the shore 
When the breath of the tempest is sweeping them o'er 
And the heads of the lofty and lowly have bowed 
As the shaft of the lightning sped out from the cloud. 

Not gathered, like Washington, home to his rest, 
When the sun of hia life was far down in the west: 
But stricken from earth in the midst of his years, 
With the Canaan in view of his prayers and his tears: 
And the people, whose hearts in the wilderness failed, 
Sometimes, when the stars of their promise had paled, 
Now stand by his side on the mount of his fame, 
And yield him their hearts in a grateful acclaim. 

Yet there on the mountain our leader must die, 
With the fair land of promise spread out to his eye: 
His work is accomplished, and what he has done 
Will stand as a monument under the sun: 
And his name, reaching down through the ages of time, 
Will still through the years of eternity shine, 
Like a star sailing on through the depths of the blue, 
On whose brightness we gaze every evening anew. 

His white tent is pitched on the beautiful plain, 
Where the tumult of battle comes never again: 

Where the smoke of the war-cloud ne'er darkens the air 
Nor falls on the spirit a shadow of care. </seg>

The songs of the ransomed enrapture his ear, 
And he heeds not the dirges that roll for him here: 
In the calm of his spirit, so strange and sublime, 
He is lifted far over the discords of time. 

Then bear him home gently, great sun of the West! 
'Mid her fair blooming prairies lay Lincoln to rest; 
From the nation who loved him she takes to her trust, 
And will tenderly garner the consecrate dust. 

A Mecca his grave to the people shall be, 
A shrine evermore for the hearts of the free. 

FEBRUARY TWELFTH 

It was early in the evening in a shop where flags were sold. 
There were large flags, middle-sized flags, small flags, and little 
bits of flags. The finest of all was Old Glory. Old Glory was 
made of silk and hung in graceful folds from the wall. 

"Attention !" called Old Glory. 

Starry eyes all over the room looked at him. 
"What dav of the month is it?" 

"February Twelfth," quickly answered the flags 
"Whose birthday is it?" 

"Abraham Lincoln's." 
"Where is he buried?" 
"Springfield, Illinois." 

"What did the people call Mr. Lincoln? You don't know? 
Well, I'll tell you. It was 'Honest Old Abe,' and Uncle Sam 
¦wants you to be like him." 

"Now, I must know if you are good American flags. How 
many red stripes have you?" 

"Seven," was the answer. 
"How manv white stripes?" 
"Six." 

"How many stars?" 

"Forty-five," shouted the large flags. The little ones said 
nothing. 

"Ah, I see," said Old Glory, "but you are not to blame. Do 
you see that open door?" he went on. "Go throught it into the 
street, put your staffs into the hands of any little boys you find, 
and bring them here." </seg>

"Yes, Captain," called the flags as they fluttered away. 

Then Old Glory pulled his silken stripes into the hallway and 
waited for the flags to come back. 

By and by the flags came back, each bringing a small boy. 
Old Glory looked at them. 

"What's the matter?" said he; "you don't seemed pleased." 

No one spoke. The little boys stared with round eyes at Old 
Glory, but held tightly to the flags. 

At last one of the flags said : "Please, Captain, these are the 
only little boys we could find." 

"Well," said Old Glory. 

"And we think they don't belong to Uncle Sam," was the 
answer. 

"Why not?" said Old Glory 

"Some of them are ragged," called one flag 
"And some are dirty," said another. 
"This one is a colored boy," said another. 
"Some of them can't speak English at all." 
"The one I found blacks boots." 

"And mine is a newsboy." 

"Mine sleeps in a dry goods box. 

"Mine plays a violin on the street corner. 

"But look at mine, Captain !" said the last flag proudly, when 
the rest were through. 

"What about him?" asked Old Glory 

"I'm sure he belongs to Uncle Sam; he lives in a very fine 
house and wears fine clothes!" 

"Of course I belong to Uncle Sam," said the brownstone boy, 
quickly, "but I think these street boys do not." 

"There! there!" said old Glory; "I'll telephone to Washington 
and find out," and Old Glory floated away. 

The little boys watched and waited. 
Back came Old Glory. 

"It's all right," said he. "Uncle Sam says every one of you 
belong to him, and he wants you to be brave and honest, for 
some day he may need you for soldiers. Oh, yes, and he said, </seg>

LINCOLN.— A SONG. 

(Written for Lincoln Day, to be sung in 4th and 5th year classes ) 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 

(Foully Assassinated April 14, 1865.) 

You lay a wreath on murdered Lincoln's bier. 
You, who with mocking pencil wont to trace, 

Broad for the self-complacent British sneer, 
His length of shambling limb, his furrowed face. 

His gaunt, gnarled hands, his unkempt, bristling hair, 
His garb uncouth, his bearing ill at ease, 

His lack of all we prize as debonair, 
Of power or will to shine, of art to please. 

You, whose smart pen backed up the pencil's laugh, 
Judging each step as tho' the way were plain, 

Reckless, so.it could point its paragraph, 
Of chief's perplexity, or people's pain. 

Beside this corpse, that bears for winding-sheet 
The Stars and Stripes he lived to rear anew, 

Between the mourners at his head and feet, 
Say, scurril jester, is there room for you? 

Yes: he had lived to shame me from my sneer, 
To lame my pencil, and confute my pen: — 

To make me own this man of princes peer, 
This rail-splitter a true-born king of men . 

My shallow judgment I had learned to rue, 
Noting how to occasion's height he rose: 

How his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true; 
How, iron-like, his temper grew by blows. 

(Air— "Hold the Fort.") 

W. W. STONE.

Praise of Lincoln's name; Sworn to do the right;

Yes! we love the name of Lincoln; Lord! we come to Thee confessing,

How humble, yet how hopeful he could be: 
How in good fortune and in ill, the same: 

Nor bitter in success, nor boastful he, 
Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame. 

He went about his work,— such work as few 
Ever had laid on head and heart and hand, — 

As one who knows, where there's a task to do, 
Man's honest will must Heaven's good grace command 

Who trusts the strength will with the burden grow, 
That God makes instruments to work his will, 

If but that will we can arrive to know, 
Nor tamper with the weights of good and ill. 

So he went forth to battle, on the side 
That he felt clear was Liberty's and Right's, 

As in his peasant boyhood he had plied 

His warfare with rude Nature's thwarting mights 
The uncleared forest, the unbroken soil, 

The iron-bark, that turns the lumberer's axe, 
The rapid, that o'erbears the boatman's toil, 

The prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks. 

The ambushed Indian, and the prowling bear:— 
Such were the deeds that helped his youth to train: 

Rough culture,— but such trees large fruit may bear, 
If but their stocks be of right girth and grain. 

So he grew up, a destined work to do, 
And lived to do it: four long-suffering years. 

Ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report, lived through, 
And then he heard the hisses change to cheers: 

The taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise, 
And took both with the same unwavering mood 

Till, as he came on light, from darkling days, 
And seemed to touch the goal from where he stood. 

A felon hand, between the goal and him, 
Reached from behind his back, a trigger prest. 

And those perplexed and patient eyes were dim. 
Those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest! 

The words of mercy were upon his lips, 
Forgiveness in his heart and on his pen, 

When this vile murderer brought ewift eclipse 
To thoughts of peace on earth, good will to men. 

The Old World and the New, from sea to sea. 
Utter one voice of sympathy and shame! 

Sore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high; 
Sad life, cut short just as its triumph came. </seg>

It was on the night of April 14, 1865, that the shot was fired 
which killed Abraham Lincoln, and its reverberation will last 
forever. On the morning following, at precisely 8:18 of the 
clock, Abraham Lincoln yielded up the ghost. The fatal moment 
is notched on the scythe of time. Even the watchmakers, those 
wardens of the hours, have embalmed that moment in the sign 
of their calling. In every city of the Union, North and South, 
East and West, you have seen that great, dumb, wooden horologue 
pointing backward to the dread event. Look at it whenever 
you will, it is always 8:18. 

The murder of Lincoln was the most appalling tragedy ever 
witnessed in a theater. On this mortal night the President had 
sought to be amused. He wished to laugh; and for this he has 
been criticised. Why should he wish tc laugh when every click 
of the telegraph was the death tick of a soldier? Why should 
he? Why should he not? There has been too much of tragedy, 
and now this laughter-loving man would gain surcease from the 
long tension on his heart-strings by forgetting fact in fiction, the 
real in the apparent. 

The box which the presidential party was to occupy had been 
appropriately draped with the Union flag so arranged as to frame 
the portrait of George Washington, whose serene and august 
face smiled from out its ample folds as from an aureole of glory. 
Midway of the performance, and shortly after 10 o'clock, a 
young man came down the outer aisle and presented his card to </seg>

            <seg id="p165">

the President's messenger. Before the messenger could fairly 
glance at the card, the young man had pushed past him and 
entered the narrow passage immediately behind the box in 
which the President was seated. Going to the door opening 
into the box, he peered at the occupants through a small aperture, 
also previously made for the purpose. 

Surely the noble Lincoln must have felt some vague consciousness 
of evil. We may never know. In a moment the 
door was opened, the murderer entered. There was a sharp 
detonation, a moment's dread paralysis, a wild commotion, a 
clutch at the fleeing assassin, a fierce imprecation, and the 
savage slash of the knife as he freed himself from the detaining 
grasp, his leap to the stage, his mock heroics, his rehearsed 
magniloquence, and the startled, bewildering cry: "The President 
is murdered!" 

Instantly with the pistol shot the President had fallen forward. 
The dear head dropped, never to rise again ; the loving heart 
fluttered into rest, and Abraham Lincoln, offered by the All 
Wise as mediator and exemplar to his distracted countrymen, 
was with the "undying dead." 

But what of the assassin? Manaically bold as now seems this 
murderer, the chances of capture had been weighed by the murderer 
and reduced to a minimum. His route to the South had 
been chosen and carefully studied. His confederates were numerous 
and discreet. His finances were ample, his equipment 
complete. And yet we are told that, except for the accident of 
his foot, as he leaped from the proscenium box, catching in a 
flag, bis escape would have been inevitable. By why call it an 
accident? It was no accident, but a miracle of gratitude, — the 
vengeance of the flag. Washington was there. Washington, 
the father who begot and brought it forth, seemed for the 
moment to live again in its embrace. Lincoln, the savior who 
had redeemed it from the sin of slavery, was even then dying 
that it might live, the last quiverings of his heart pulsing in all 
its breathing folds. 

It was no accident. In the absence of human intervention, the </seg>

flajj itself became an avenger. It reached forth and grappled 
with the assassin. It clove to him like the bloody garment of 
old mythology. It shrieked and was rent in twain, but clung — 
clung — clung, writhing about and binding him like a python in 
its coils. The flag was the captor. The flag was its country's 
Nemesis. 

All hail the flasj, sparkling with its stars, conscious of itself, its 
God, and its America. Look up, my countrymen! Look up, 
poor human race; look up to it in reverence and with a prayer 
of gratitude! What wonder that it seems like a gift from the 
spirit world, as though Father Abraham had reached it forth 
from behind the stars, and said: "Take it, my children; study 
it, learn it, know it, anu love it always."

YOUR MISSION. 

[May be sung to the tune, ''Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing."] 

Do not then stand idly waiting 
For some greater work to do; 

Fortune is a lazy goddess, 
She will never come to you. 

Go and toil in any vineyard, 
Do not fear to do or dare; 
If you want a field of labor, 

You can find it everywhere.

If you cannot on the ocean 
Sail among the swiftest fleet, 
Rocking on the highest billows, 
Laughing at the storms you meet, 
You can stand among the sailors. 
Anchored yet within the bay; 
You can lend a hand to help them. 
As they launch their boats away. 

If you have not gold and silver. 
Ever ready to command. 
If you cannot to the needy 
Reach an ever open hand, 
You can visit the afflicted, 
O'er the erring you can weep. 
You can be a true disciple. 
Sitting at the Savior's feet. 

If you are too weak to journey 
Up the mountain steep and high, 
You can stand within the valley, 
While the multitudes go by. 
You can chant in happy measure, 
As they slowly pass along, — 
Though they may forget the singer, 
They will not forget the song. 

If you cannot in the conflict. 
Prove yourself a soldier true. 
If where fire and smoke are thickest 
There's no work for you to do, 
When the battlefield is silent, 
You can go with careful tread, 
You can bear away the wounded, 
You can cover up the dead. </seg>

ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 
JAMES A. GARFIELD. 

In the great drama of the rebellion there were two acts. The 
first was the war, with its battles and sieges, its victories and 
defeats, its sufferings and tears, just as the curtain was lifting onthe 
second and final act, the restoration of peace and liberty, the 
evil spirit of the rebellion, in the fury of despair, nerved and 
directed the hand of an assassin to strike down the chief character 
in both. It was no man who killed Abraham Lincoln ; it 
was the embodied spirit of treason and slavery, inspired with 
fearful and despairing hate, that struck him down in the moment 
of the Nation's supremest joy. 

Sir, there are times in the history of men and nations, when 
they stand so near the veil that separates the mortals from the 
immortals, time from eternity, and men from God, that they can 
almost hear the beatings and pulsations of the heart of the 
Infinite. Through such a time has this Nation passed. 

When two hundred and fifty thousand brave spirits passed 
from the field of honor, through that thin veil, to the presence 
of God, and when at last its parting folds admitted the martyred 
President to the company of those dead heroes of the Republic, 
the Nation stood so near the veil that the whispers of God were 
heard by the children of men. Awe-stricken by his voice, the 
American people knelt in tearful reverence and made a solemn 
covenant with him and with each other that this Nation 
should be saved from its enemies, that all its glories should 
be restored, and, on the ruins of slavery and treason, the 
temples of freedom and justice should be built, and should survive 
forever. 

It remains for us, consecrated by that great event and under a 
covenant with God, to keep that faith, to go forward in the 
great work until it shall be completed. Following the lead of 
that great man, and obeying the high behests of God, let us 
remember that: 

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat: 

He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat: 

Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! 

Our God is marching on.

SPECIAL DAYS. 

WASHINGTON AND LINCOLN. 

It is natural that at this time our thoughts should turn toward 
two of our great national heroes. This month is to us not 
merely the month of February, marking one of the twelve divisions 
of our calendar year, but it is a continuous memorial of 
two of our revered statesmen. We read all we can about our 
glorified dead, we search the words spoken by them, we visit 
the places where they toiled for us, and we scan even their 
homes trying to form a picture of their lives. We do even 
more. We presume to imagine their thoughts and conjure up 
the very ideas which might have occurred to them as they stood 
in these spots now hallowed by memories of them. 

It is a fascinating occupation trying to fathom the characters 
of truly great men and contemplate their attitude toward various 
subjects. Sometimes mere conjectures are the fruit of our toil. 
At other times sure conclusions are reached from facts which 
are brought to light. Stories galore are told of both Lincoln and 
Washington, which help us more vividly to picture their natures. 
The question in which we are interested could easily be answered 
if we knew these men, but still as we are acquainted with the 
manifestations of their characteristics, we can answer it almost as 
satisfactorily. Did Lincoln and Washington love nature? Could 
they appreciate her beauties, and did they evince an interest in 
her creations? 

Lincoln, in his log-cabin home, splitting rails, working on the 
farm, hunting coons, driving the horses and cattle, must have 
found a glorious opportunity to become acquainted with this 
great mother of ours. The son of a pioneer, who, with his 
great covered wagon, cattle, family, and household belongings, 
wanders over the country, whose only neighbors for hundreds of 
miles are the birds in the woods, the rabbits in the fields, and the 
fish in the stream, the son of such a man certainly sees Nature as 
few of our city-bred, World's Fair, Paris Exposition, young people 
can imagine it. Lincoln was content with these, his neighbors. 
Never do we hear sighs from him and wishes that his lot 
might be exchanged for that of another, even if his lot was toil- </seg>

some and lonely. Who can tell but he thus imbibed his love for 
pure freedom undefiled and his lofty conceptions of this life in 
its relation to this world and something beyond? 

We cannot doubt that the great, tall, clumsy lad had a real 
love in his heart for the little feathered and furry friends about 
him, and not simply a love for the beautiful ones, but what is far 
higher, a feeling of sympathy even for the ugly and a genuine 
tender solicitude for all. 

Even when the youth became a man perplexed by business and 
political problems, his nature remained unaltered. Once when a 
party of his friends on a judicial circuit stopped to water their 
horsee, Lincoln was not there. His companion on the way was 
asked of his whereabouts. He replied that the last he had seen 
of Lincoln he was hunting around for a bird's nest, two of the 
former occupants of which he held in his hand. The wind had 
blown the tiny nestlings from their snug little home and the 
gt eat-hearted man was trying to find the nest for the wee, helpless 
chirpers. The same great heart which felt the human cry 
of pain as keenly as the bewildered cry of the little birds gave its 
last throb to restore little black nestlings to the warm comfort of 
free homes protected by the law. 

There is an amusing incident, told probably as a "good one" 
upon the politician, but which has more than an amusing side to 
us. Lincoln was one of a party of ladies and gentlemen, dressed 
in their best, journeying along a country road. Their attention 
was arrested by the distressed squealing of a pig. There it was 
by the roadside, caught in a fence. Of course a general laugh 
followed. To the astonishment of all, Lincoln, clad as he was, 
dismounted from the horse and released the poor animal. He 
could not see even an occupant of the pig-sty suffer without 
feelings of sympathy. 

We expect different stories of Washington, a different attitude 
toward Nature and animals, just as the nature of the man was 
different. Visit Mt. Vernon and you at once feel his relation to 
the natural world, a love and keen appreciation of the beautiful 
in nature, with a thorough conviction that where man tampers </seg>

sl'KC'IAL DAYS. 

with the rough beauties of Nature a severe orderliness, precision, 
and care must be manifested. 

Seated upon his front veranda, Washington beheld every day 
a scene of beauty, one gaze at which stays with a stranger for 
months and for years. The green of his own lawn ending 
abruptly not far away with the decline of the bluff, the tops of 
a few trees farther down just visible, and the blue waters of the 
Potomac bounded in the distance by the bluff of the opposite 
bank; to the right a carefully mowed lawn, sloping away in 
natural terraces to the bank of the river; to the left a small 
sward and orchard; behind the house a large green plat. It is 
to the left of the beautiful, sunny, open space behind the house 
that the garden is found. Every visitor must spend a few 
moments there, admiring the hedges, the neatly trimmed boxtrees, 
the regular, formal designs, and incidentally bidding 
"Good-day" to the saucy little squirrel who scampers about the 
paths. It is an interesting spot as revealing what Washington 
considered the beauty of scenic gardening. 

Washington is said to have loved noble horses and to have 

taken great pride in his stables. He always drove white horses 
with hoofs painted black. Of dogs, too, he was exceedingly 
fond, and kept an accurate account of the pedigree of every 
animal belonging to the estate. Usually he drove in a carriage 
drawn by a span, while his family came next in a larger vehicle 
drawn by four horses. On state occasions he allowed himself 
the luxury of an elegant coach and six. 

Varied are the feelings with which one views the estate of our 
first president. It is almost impossible in the midst of all this 
beauty to realize that it was the same man who enjoyed this 
peaceful home of luxury and spent that awful winter at Valley 
Forge, or crossed the Delaware amid the floating ice. The 
quiet restfulness of Mt. Vernon must have been a haven of peace 
to the valiant soldier who faced the enemy so bravely, to the 
statesman who toiled so assiduously for his country, and to the 
heart of human sympathy returning even from the cities of 1776. 

At the foot of a gentle slope, about midway between the house 
and boatlanding, is the tomb of the Washington family. The </seg>

very aged, gray restingplace has been exchanged for one of 
more modern design. An open vault in front with a protection 
of iron grating and other chambers extending into the earth, 
form the tomb. It is with awe that the visitor approaches the 
open vault to gaze upon the gray sarcophagi of George and 
Martha Washington standing out in bold relief against the dark 
gray walls and background. Few are the letters sculptured 
upon the stone caskets, but above the wall behind them is a 
square slab bearing the words: "I am the resurrection and the 
life; he that belie veth on Me shall not perish but have everlasting 
life." 

It is touching to see the tributes which have been paid to this 
great man, the trees planted in his honor, the monuments erected 
to his memory, but none is more touching than the unconscious 
tribute which Nature herself is giving. The tomb is silent and 
cold. One thinks of the sterner qualities of the dead, when a 
bit of color catches the eye. There above the sarcophagi in a 
corner of the inscribed tablet, nestle two little birds, a fitting 
tribute of Mother Nature to her love and trustfulness in one of 
her noblest sons.

AN EPITAPH ON WASHINGTON. 

The defender of his country, — the founder of liberty, 
The friend of man. 

History and tradition are explored in vain 
For a parallel to his character. 

In the annals of modern greatness 
He stands alone, 

And the noblest names of Antiquity 
Lose tneir luster in his presence. 
Born the benefactor of mankind. 

He united all the greatness necessary 
To an illustrious career. 
Nature made him great, 

He made himself virtuous. 

Called by his Country to the defense of her Liberties, 
He triumphantly vindicated the rights of humanity. 

And, on the pillars of National Independence, 
Laid the foundation of a great Republic. 
Twice invested with Supreme Magistracy 
By the unanimous vote of a free people. 

He surpassed, in the Cabinet, 
The glories of the field, 

And, voluntarily resigning the scepter and the aword 
Retired to the shades of private life: 
A spectacle so new, and so sublime, 

Was contemplated with profoundest admiration: 
And the name of Washington, 

Adding new luster to humanity, 

Resounded to the remotest regions of tne earth. 

Magnanimous in youth, 
Glorious through life, 

Great in death ; 

His highest ambition, — the happiness of mankind, 
His noblest victory, — the conquest of himself. 

Bequeathing to posterity the inheritance of his fame, 
And building his monument in the hearts of his countrymen, 

He lived — the ornament of the Eighteenth Century: 
He died, regretted by a mourning world. </seg>

ORIGIN OF MEMORIAL DAY IN THE NORTH. 

Gen. John Murray was the originator of Memorial Day in the 
North. While visiting in the South in the winter of 1867- 68, he 
noticed the touching rite of decorating soldiers' graves with flowers 
by the ladies. Being very much impressed with this custom, 
he introduced a similar one at his own home. 

On the 5th day of May, 1868, Gen. John A. Logan, who was 
then Com mander-in- Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic 
established Decoration Day, and by a general order, May 2°, 
1868, was designated as a day set apart for the purpose of paying 
tribute to the memory of those brave men who died in defense 
of their country. The national encampment held in Washington 
had it incorporated in its rules and regulations, May 11, 
1870. Since then, in many of the States, May 30th has been 
established as a holiday, and it is the universal custom to decorate 
the graves of all ex-soldiers, thus making it one of the most 
patriotic days of the year, wherein all classes unite in paying 
tribute to our heroic dead, and feel a conscious pride in being 
able to thus show respect for their memory and the cause for 
which they fought.

We give our Heads.' and our Hearts to our Country/ — One 
Country! One Language! One Flag! 

The manner of execution is as follows : 

The pupils having been assembled and being seated, and the 
flag borne by the standard-bearer being in front of school, at the 
signal (either by a chord struck on the piano, or in the absence 
of a piano, from a bell) each scholar seizes the seat, preparatory 
to rising. 

2d Signal. The whole school rises quickly, as one person, 
each one standing erect and alert. 

jd Signal. The right arm is extended, pointing directly at 
the flag; as the flag-bearer should be on the platform where all 
can see the colors, the extended arm will be slightly raised above 
a horizontal line. 

4th Signal. The arm is bent so as to touch the forehead 
lightly with the tip of the fingers of the right hand. The motion 
should be quick, but graceful, the elbow being kept down and 
not allowed to "stick out" to the right. As the fingers touch 
the forehead, each pupil will exclaim with a clear voice, "We 
give our Heads P" 1 emphasizing the word heads. 

5th Signa 1 . The right hand is carried quickly to the left 
side and placed flat over the heart, with the words: "and our 
Hearts?" uttered after the movement has been made. 

6th Signal. The right hand is allowed to fall quickly, but 
easily, to the right side; as soon as the motion is accomplished, 
all will say, "to Our Country /" A brief pause will follow the 
word country, and then at the 

7th Signal. Each scholar, still standing erect, but without 
moving, will exclaim: "One Country /" (emphasis on country. .) 

8th Signal. The scholars still standing motionless will 
exclaim: "One Language /" (emphasis on language.) 

pth Signal. The right arm is suddenly extended to its full 
length, the hand pointing to the flag, the body inclining slightly 
forward, supported by the right foot slightly advanced, the attitude 
should be that of intense earnestness; the -pupil reaches as it 
¦were, toward the flag, at the same time exclaiming with great 
force— "One FlagP' </seg>

position of attention is recovered. 

nth Signal. Each scholar seizes the seat preparatory to 
turning it down. 

1 2th Signal. The school is seated. 

THE FLAG-BEARER. 

The color-bearer, standing where all can see him, grasps the 
staff at the lower end with his right hand, and a foot or more 
(according to the length of the staff) above the lower end of 
the staff with his left hand. The staff is held directly in front of 
the body, slightly inclined forward from the perpendicular. At 
the fourth signal the flag will be dipped, returning the salute; 
this is done by lowering the left hand until the staff is nearly 
horizontal, keeping it in that position until the tenth signal, when, 
it will be restored to its first or nearly vertical position. 

— George T. Batch. 

O0R FLAG. 

Erstwhile we loved our starry flag, and stood beneath it, fain 
To kiss its folds, as wide unrolled it waved o'er hill and plain; 
Erstwhile, with lips that smiled, men died to keep that flag on high — 
That flag that ever seemed to us far less of earth and sky, 
With morning's white, and evening's red, and noontide's cloudless blue 
Repeated in the glory of its colors: tint and hue 

As strong as are our mountains, as deep as are our waves, 
Great flag, that floats above our homes, and o'er our soldiers' graves. 

Erstwhile we thought we cared for it, our banner of the stars, 
And probably conned that galaxy and those pellucid bars; 
But now we love it better, and are thrilled with dearer joy, 
And sweeter songs we're learning, and we count it brave employ 
To tell our children of the men who in the battle's van 
Have borne our flag for freedom and the lifting up of man; 
To tell them of our sailors who have once again at sea 
Shown all the world how fearless our mariners can be: 
Erstwhile we loved our starry Sag, to-day from shore to shore, 
We stand beneath it reverently, and love our God the more. 

"Westward the star of Empire," was what we used to say, 
But we are learning now to frame that text another way; 
For eastward drifts our commerce, and eastward sound our guns, 
And eastward we are sending our most heroic sons. </seg>

STA1K SUPERINTENDENT 6 KKHOKT. 

Our liberty beneath the law we'll send the ancient east, 
And the strong spirit of our west, to work like heaven's yeast: 
Our flag shall mean the breaking of the age-worn fetters there. 
Our flag shall carry love and hope for hatred and despair. 

Erstwhile we loved our country's flag, baptized in blood and fire, 
To-day we almost worship it — flag of the world's desire! 
Jehovah guard it evermore, and keep it pure of stain, 
Jehovah give us wisdom still, right counsel to maintain. 
Let every little child to-day, and every gray-haired man, 
Be swift for that dear flag of stars to do whate'er he can: 
And young and old, and rich and poor, and south and north together 
Join hands to hold that banner high, through all the world's rough weather: 
God bless it, wheresoe'er it floats, from masthead or from spire, 
God guard it evermore, our flag! — flag of the world's desire. 

— Margaret E. Songster, in Woman's Home Companion. 

WITH THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE. 

An interesting incident is told by the newspapers of Paris of 
the last hours of the session of the American and Spanish peace 
commission. 

When the treaty between the two countries was signed, it was 
proposed by some one that, out of acknowledgment of the hospitality 
of the French government, the momentous document 
should be tied with a tricolored ribbon — the red, white and blue 
of the French flag. 

The American commissioners readily assented to this, not only 
because they were quite willing to offer France the compliment, 
but also because the red, white and blue are their own 
national colors. 

A messenger was sent for the tricolored ribbon, but no such 
thing was to be found in the building of the ministry of foreign 
affairs, in which the session was taking place. This important 
department of state was without such an emblem of the 
Republic. 

At this juncture a French functionary had a happy thought. 

"The confectioners always have them," he said, "to tie up 
boxes of candy for patriotic people. Here, Jean," he called to a 
messenger of the department, "run over to X's, the confectioner 
in the Rue Saint-Honore, and buy me a pound of macaroons. 
And be sure to ask the man to tie up the parcel with a tricolored 
ribbon." </seg>

SPECIAL DAYS. 

After a little wait the messenger came back with a package 
of macaroons, tied up with a narrow, red, white and blue ribbon ; 

and with this confectioner's "string" the treaty of peace between 
America and Spain was tied. — YoutKs Companion.

Oh, sailor, young sailor, with tan on your cheek. 
What flag is your schooner to fly at her peak? 
Oh, Jack in blue jacket, I pray you, declare 
What colors your busy, brown fingers prepare. 
"What flag but the grandest?" my sailor-boy said: 
"The star-spangled Union, the stripes white and red: 
The flower of all ensigns, the pride of the sky: 
No flag but 'Old Glory' my beauty shall fly !" 
Oh, sailor, my sailor, you've chosen aright ! 
Thus prize it forever, that banner of light, 
Each stripe has a meaning you yet cannot guess: 
Each star is more sacred than words may express. 
O'er desolate ice-fields,— 'mid islands of palm,— 
It lives through the storm, and it sleeps through the calm. 
It guides, through the war-clouds, on perilous ways: 
It decks the glad cities on festival days. 

In far-away harbors, where many ships meet, 
Where dark foreign faces look strange in the street, 
The flag flaps a greeting, and kinsmen who roam 
All bless the brave colors that tell them of home. 

Wherever it flutters, the bride of the breeze, 
A message of freedom it flings o'er the seas, 
A hope for the world,— and the heart that beats true 
Must leap at the sight of the Red, White, and Blue.

Thirst for glory, love of strife; 

Gentle hearts from quiet ways, 
Turned to save a nation's life, 

Lest in jealous fragments torn 

Freedom's land should come to scorn. 

O'er the Gray, as o'er the Blue, 
Nature's bursting tears will flow; 

Both were brave, and both were true 
And fought for all they loved below. 

Pity ! nor forbid the tear 
Shed above so sad a bier. 

Cherish, then, the patriot fires,

In God that Freedom ne'er expires 
Where virtue guards the martyr's dust,

And saved the imperiled Hope of Earth."

Revolutionary Pupil — 

I bad heard the muskets' rattle of the April running battle; 
Lord Percy's hunted soldiers, I can see their red-coats still; 
But a deadly chill comes e'er me, as the day looms up before me, 
When a thousand men lay bleeding on the slopes of Bunker Hill. 
Here are lilies for the valorous, and roses for the brave: 
And laurel for the victor's crown, and rue for lowly grav«. 
There's crimson for the blood that flowed that Freedom might be free, 
And golden for the heart* of gold that died for you and me: 

Till love no more is loving, we lift our souls and say, 
For liberty and loyalty we bles-s their names to-day ! 

Civil War Pupil- 

Strew the fair garlands where slumber the dead, 
Ring out the strains like the swell of the sea, 

Heartfelt the tribute we lay on the bed. 
Sound o'er the brave the refrain of the free, 

Sound the refrain of the loyal and free, 
Visit each sleeper and hallow each bed, 

Wave the starred banner from seacoast to sea. 
Grateful the living, and honored the dead. 

Cuban War Pupil (carrying Cuban flag) — 

New graves we crown with flowers to day, 

New homes shall saddened be; 
For loved ones sleeping far away, 

And some beneath the sea. 

Twas for humanity and right 
Our loved boys fought and died: 
To lift the islands into light 
And break the Spanish pride. 
We'll wrap the Bible in the flag 

And back them with our might, 
And bear them over sea and crag, 

In lofty eagle's flight. 

And break the bands of heathen night, 
And set the islands free; 

Till Freedom sheds her glorious light 
O'er every land and sea.

DECORATION DAY. 

Yes, scatter flowers above the graves 
Where the Nation's dead are sleeping, 

To tell that comrades, left behind, 
Their memories green are keeping. 

Tis many a year since they marched forth, 
All the battle's perils braving, 

And many a year above their graves 
Has the long, green grass been waving. 

Yes, scatter the flowers — 'tis a kindly thought — 
Pale lilies and fair red roses, 

With lavish hands o'er the graves where each 
Brave soldier in peace reposes. 

Long years have passed since they sank to rest, 
'Mid a Nation's bitter mourning, 

But their faithful comrades, year by year, 
Bring flowers for their graves adorning. 

But far away upon hill and plain. 
Nameless, forgotten, are lying 

The bones of many who bravely fought, 
In their country's service dying. 

But though their graves are unknown, unsought, 
Our dear Lord covers them over 

With the sweetest flowers and the greenest grass, 
And blossoms of scented clover. 

And instead of the muffled beat of drums. 
Its saddening memories bringing, 

The only sound that the silence breaks 
Is the note of some wild bird singing; 

Or a rush of timid, rapid feet, 
As the wild gray rabbit passes, 

Or the drowsy hum of the honey bee 
As it flits among the grasses. </seg>

Who heard their country's cry,

And died for liberty.

While gray-haired patriots laid their blooms 
Upon the graves of Blue and Gray.

Of war rings o'er the peopled land: 

A Nation's heroes fight and fall —

And now full well a people know 
Thy sacredness — Memorial Day.

Let roses fall, for one and all, 

On the graves of the Blue and Gray !

Rose-wreaths for the Blue and Gray!

DECORATION DAY. 

(Written by Rev. S. F. Smith, D. D., author of "America," in answer to 

personal letter of Geo. K. Hoover in 1893.) 

The poem was suggested to Dr. Smith, the poet, as he saw about thin 
young people preparing flowers for Decoration Day. 

I. 

Sweet in the innocence of youth, 
Born of the brave and the free, 

They wove fair garlands while they sang 
"My country, 'tis of thee;" 

How every bosom swelled with joy, 
And thrilled with grateful pride, 

As, fond, the whispering cadence breathes, 
"Land where my fathers died." 

II. 

Fair flowers in sweet boquets they tied, 

Breaths from the vales and hill, 

While childish voices poured the strain, 
"I love thy rocks and rills;" 

Kach face grew radiant with the thought, 

"Land of the noble free," 
Kach voice seemed reverent as it trilled, 
"Sweet land of liberty." </seg>

And bud and bloom and leaf they bound, 
And bade the living keep, 

Unharmed and pure, the cherished graves 
Where brave men salmly sleep; 

And thus while infant lips began 
To lisp "sweet freedom's song," 

Manhood's deep tones from age to age, 
Shall still "the sound prolong." 

IV. 

I hailed the promise of the scene, 
Gladness was in the strain; 

The glorious land is safe while love 
Still swells the fond refrain; 

And what shall be our sure defense? 
Who guards our liberty? 

Not man,— not arms alone,— we look, 
"Our fathers' God to Thee." 

THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.

Whence the fleets of iron have fled, 

Where the bladesof the grave-grass quiver, 
Asleep are the ranks of the dead —

Waiting the judgment day; 

Under '.he one, the Blue; 
Under the other, the Gray. 

These, in the rob ings of glory, 
Those, in the gloom of defeat; 

All, with battle-blood gory, 
In the dusk of eternity meet — 

Under the sod and the dew, 
Waiting the judgment day; 

Under the laurel, the Blue; 
Under the willow, the Gray. 

From the silence of mournful hours, 
The desolate mourners go, 

Lovingly laden with flowers, 
Alike for the friend and foe. 

Under the sod and the dew, 
Waiting the judgment day;

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

"IN PLACE REST." 

"Possibly none but old soldiers will understand the significance 
of this term. To the soldier it suggests nearly everything 
pertaining to soldierly character and soldierly duty. When 
battle was imminent, or in progress, and the regiments were in 
line of battle, there would come intervals of quiet. A command 
might be in position for five minutes, for an hour, or three 
hours, awaiting orders or awaiting development of the battle. 
In such cases the order was 'In place rest.' That is, each soldier 
might sit down, or lie down, or rest as best suited him, but 
he must keep in place so that on the instant he would be ready 
to make a charge or to repel one. 

"The image that comes to the mind, that is expressed in the 
words, is of the soldier fully armed, fully prepared and ready for 
whatever may come. The figure is that of the soldier in his 
place, ready, alert, watchful, but at rest. The picture is of soldiers 
in unbroken line or in solid columns waiting orders. It is 
a picture of men who have subordinated the individual to a 
defined purpose, to a great cause; of men who at rest are ready 
on the instant when the call comes; of men who are in place, 
who have taken the position resignedly under orders and who 
await the words of the Great Commander or the bugle blast 
'Forward.' 

"This 'In place rest' is a good text for Decoration Day. In 
one of the great battles at the very crisis of the conflict, one of 
the finest regiments in the service was formed to repel a bayonet 
charge. They knew that when the charge came it would be a 
terrible one, but as they waited they 'rested in place.' Suddenly 
there was the sharp ringing order that brought every man 
into position to resist the bayonet charge. The next day in 
passing over the field scores of men of that regiment were found 
dead in perfect alignment. They had been shot as they knelt 
or as they stood to receive the charge. That regiment turned 
the tide of battle. It stood like a rock, but it left one-third of its 
members dead on the line of battle. There had been no faltering, 
no hesitation. There had been strict obedience to orders, 
the courage that makes men great, the calmness of men looking </seg>

death in the face. In the same battle one of the most popular 
colonels was wounded to death. As his men carried him to a 
place of safety and lowered him tenderly to the ground, he murmured, 
'In place rest,' and that was all."

"In place rest!" 

What music in these simple words, 
To those who heard them long ago: 

Unequalled by the songs of birds 
When fire of day is burning low. 

"In place rest!" 

How weary of the battle's roar, 
The leaden storm that long has raged: 

The crimson tides of blood that pour 

From hearts in deadly strife engaged . 

'In place rest!" 

The soldier waits the battle shock, 
The rushing of the mighty ware 
That breaks upon the solid rock 
And groaning finds a silent grave. 

"In place rest!" 

The foe retreats, the cheers resound, 
The tattered ensign dimly shines 

Above the corse-strewn battle ground. 
Beyond the broken battle lines. 

"In place rest!" 

Brave soldiers close your eyes in sleep 

On mother earth's untroubled breast, 

And let the white-robed angels keep 

Their vigils while you sweetly rest. 

"In place rest!" 

We come with chaplets bright with bloom 

And with the tears of heaven wet 

And lay them on the soldier's tomb, 
For, oh, we never can forget.

The mother of a soldier who has gone to face the fray: 
She gave him to her country with a blessing on his head;

The mother of a soldier — she gave him to her land; 

She saw him on the transport as he waved his sunbrowned hand; 
She kissed him through the teardrops and she told him to be brave; 
Her prayers went night and morning with her boy upon the wave. 

The mother of a soldier — her comfort and her joy, 
She gave her dearest treasure when she gave her only boy ; 
She saw the banners waving, she heard the people cheer; 
She clasped her hands and bravely looked away to hide a tear. 

The mother of a soldier — ah! cheer the hero deed 

And cheer the brave who battle 'neath the banner of their creed: 
But don't forget the mothers through all the lonely years, 
That fight the bravest battles on the sunless field of tears. 

Nay, don't forget the mothers — the mothers of our men, 
Who see them go and never know that, they'll come back again; 
That give them to their country to battle and to die, 
Because the bugles call them and the starry banners fly. 

The mother of a soldier — hats off to her, I say! 

Whose head is bowed in sorrow with its tender locks of gray. 
She gave without regretting, though her old heart sorely bled 
When she found his name this morning in the long list of the dead: 
'Killed— Sergeant Thomas Watkins, while leading on the rest, 
His dear old mother's portrait clasped upon bis hero breast!"

IMPORTANCK OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO THE COUNTRY'S 

SCHOOL SYSTEM 

William Howard Brett, librarian of the Cleveland public 
library, discusses in the Independent various measures calculated 
to increase the usefulness of public libraries. The free public 
library, he writes, is as definitely an educational institution as the 
free public school. Together they form the equipment provided 
by the whole people acting together for the education of themselves 
and their children in the duties of citizenship. For this 
reason they have found their origin and their greatest development 
in free lands among free peoples. It is only by shaping 
-every detail of organization and method toward this educational 
purpose and by making them consistent with this spirit of freedom 
that the library may hope to attain its greatest usefulness. 

The motto of the American Library Association probably 
expresses the purpose of the modern free library as well as it is 
possible to express it with the same brevity — "The best reading 
tor the greatest number at the lowest cost. 1 " The quality of its 
work, the extent of its field, and the necessity of good business 
methods in its management are all implied in these few words. 
Expressed more fully, the purpose of the library is to bring 
within reach of all for whose benefit it is established and to 
assist them in selecting and using those books which will be best 
for them. It begins with those pupils in our public schools who 
have just acquired the ability to distinguish the words on the 
printed page and leads them into storyland, where reading soon 
becomes to them, to use the words of one of our most loved and 
most successful librarians, not merely "an art learned, but a 
delight discovered." It goes with the pupil through all the 
different grades to the day of graduation, lending a glow of 
romance to the pages of history, extending the information of 
the text-book of geography, by travelers' true tales and giving </seg>

additional fullness and richness to the studies of the entire 
¦course. 

Its work, bears upon all the important interests of life. It supplies 
information in regard to the mechanic arts and business; it 
-aids in preparation for the duties of citizenship, and for the 
enrichment and elevation of the individual life; it opens up pathways 
into the loftiest realms of thought, of emotion, and of 
inspiration. 

All of this work is educational in the broadest and truest 
sense. The importance of it, its wonderful possibilities, impose 
a great responsibility, upon those to whom our libraries are 
•entrusted. 

The duty of the library board in selecting books for the 
library, although it may seem to be quite different, is essentially 
the same as that of the school authorities in selecting text-books 
¦for the schools. In one case we, as citizens, select a body to 
govern our schools, put the selection of the text-books for the 
¦children into its hands and abide by its decision. In the other 
case we, as citizens, select a body to govern our library, the 
institution which is to the whole community what the school is 
to the children, put the selection of books into its hands and 
abide by its decision. In the case of the school board it will 
seek the best expert advice in the selection of the text-books, 
but, naturally, will not consult those who are to use the books. 
On the other hand, the library board will often find its best 
advisers, as to the value of books, among those who use the 
library. It will, as in the case of the school board, be guided by 
those opinions which appear worthy of acceptance and disregard 
those that do not; but with it, and not with its advisers, rests the 
•duty and responsibility of deciding. 

The place of light fiction in the public library, is one of the 
difficult questions. It is sometimes said that these are the people's 
libraries, and should contain the books which the people 
ask for. Would we not rather say that they are the people's 
libraries, and should contain the books which the people need? 

In the selection of technical and special books expert advice 
is absolutely necessary, and in all cases the critical opinion based

on the matured judgment may well be followed. On the other 
hand, the demand, even a strong demand, for a book which does 
not appear to have value either as literature or as information 
may well be quietly left unheeded.

ROCKING-CHAIR TRAVELS 

You sit down snug and quiet, 

A book upon your knee — 
A wonder-book that tells about 

The lands across the sea: 

And then a strange thing happens: 

You do not leave your chair, 
But as you read about these lands 

It seems that you are there. 

You see the queerest people, 
They talk a language new, 

The buildings are not those you know, 
The streets are strange to you. 

But you are never frightened, 
It's pleasant to be there, 

For you can always quickly come 
Back to your rocking-chair. 

It does you good to journey 
In such an easy way: 

To learn about the big, round world, 
And how it looks to-day. 

This way a child should travel, 
The road is very fair: 

It's safe and best for little ones 
To go by rocking-chair.

READING. 

JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL. 

One is sometimes asked by young men to recommend to them 
a course of reading. My advice would always be to confine 
yourself to the supreme books in whatever literature ; still better, 
to choose some one great author and grow thoroughly familiar 
with him. For as all roads lead to Rome, so they all likewise 
lead thence; and you will find that in order to understand perfectly 
and weigh exactly any really vital piece of literature, you </seg>

will be gradually and pleasantly persuaded to studies and explorations 
of which you little dreamed when you began, and you 
will find yourselves scholars before you are aware. If I may be 
allowed a personal illustration, it was my own profound admiratian 
for the "Divina Comedia" of Dante that lured me into what 
little learning I possess. For remember that there is nothing 
less fruitful than scholarship for the sake of mere scholarship, 
nor anything more wearisome in the attainment. But the moment 
you have an object and a center, attention is quickened, the 
mother of memory, and whatever you acquire groups and arranges 
itself in an order which is lucid because it is everywhere 
in intelligent relation to an object of constant and growing interest. 


A PLAIN STORY. 

I'm a clumsy, awkward toad, 
And I hop along the road — 

Tis the only way we toads can well meander 
While in yonder marshy bog. 
Leaps my relative, the frog, 

Very near my aunt, the Salamander. 

And if you should ever stray 
Near a slimy pool, some day, 

And along its grassy margin chance to loiter. 
Do not pass it lightly by, 
For it is the spot where I 

Was born, a lively tadpole in the water. 

And although I take no pride 
In my ugly, warty hide, 

Yet they say within my head there is a jewel: 
But I hope you will not tell, 
For you all know, very well, . ' 

That some boys (whom I could name) are very cruel. 

I'm a homely, harmless thing, 
I catch insects on the wing. 

And in this, I serve you all, it is my duty; 
And now tell me, which is beet 
To be useless and well dressed, 

Or be useful, even though I have no beauty?

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

CONCILIATION OF AMERICA. 

EDMUND BURKE. 

From six capital sources — of descent, of form of government, 
of religion in the northern provinces, of manners in the southern, 
of education, of the remoteness of situation from the first mover 
of government — from all these causes a fierce spirit of liberty 
has grown up. It looks to me to be narrow and pedantic to 
prosecute that spirit as criminal; to apply the ordinary doctrines 
of criminal justice to this great public contest. I do not know 
the right method of drawing up an indictment against a whole 
people. 

My idea is to admit our colonies into an interest in the constitution. 
A revenue from America! You can never receive it; 
no, not a shilling. For all service, whether of revenue, trade, or 
empire, my trust is in her interest in the British constitution. M)-hold 
of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from 
common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges and 
equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are 
as strong as links of iron. 

Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights 
associated with our government — they will cling and grapple to 
you; and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them 
from their allegiance. But let it once be understood that your 
government may be one thing and their privileges another: that 
these two things may exist without any mutual relation — the 
cement is gone; the cohesian is loosened — and everything 
hastens to decay and dissolution. 

As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign 
authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred 
temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen 
race and sons of England worship freedom they will turn their 
faces toward you. The more they multiply, the more friends 
you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more 
perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. 
It is a weed that grows in every soil. But until you 
become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural 
dignity, freedom they can have from none but you. </seg>

oPKCIAL DATS. 

This is the commodity of price, of which you have the 
monopoly. This is the true act of navigation, which binds lo 
you the commerce of the colonies, and through them secures to 
you the wealth of the world. Deny them this participation of 
freedom, and you break the unity of the empire. It is the spirit 
of the English Constitution which, infused through the mighty 
mass, pervades, feeds, unites, invigorates, vivifies every part of 
the empire, even down to the minutest member. Is it not the 
same virtue which does everything for us here in England? 

Magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom ; and 
a great empire and little minds go ill together. If we are conscious 
of our situation, and glow with zeal to fill our places as 
becomes our station and ourselves, we ought to auspicate all 
our public proceedings on America with the old warning of the 
church, Lift up your hearts ! We ought to elevate our minds to 
the greatness of that trust to which the order of Providence has 
called us. By adverting to the dignity of this high calling, our 
ancestors have turned a savage wilderness into a glorious 
empire, and have made the most extensive and the only honorable 
conquests, not only by destroying, but by promoting the 
wealth, the number, the happiness of the human race. 

MY SHADOW. 

I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me, 
And what can be the use of -him is more than I can see. 
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head; 
And I gee him jump before me, when I jump into my bed. 

The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow — 
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow; 
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball, 
And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all. 

One morning, very early, before the sun was up, 
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup: 
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy head, 
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.

THE DUMB SOLDIER. 

When the grass was closely mown, 
Walking- on the lawn alone, 

Under grass alone he lies, 
Looking up with leaden eyes, 
Scarlet coat and painted gun, 
To the stars and to the sun. 

In the turf a hole I found, 

And hid a soldier underground. 

Spring and daisies came apace, 
Grasses hid my hiding-place. 
Grasses run like a green sea 
O'er the lawn up to my knee. 

When the grass is ripe like grain. 
When the scythe is stoned again, 
When the lawn is shaven clear, 
Then my hole shall reappear. 

I shall find him, never fear, 
I shall find my grenadier; 
But for all that's gone and come, 
I shall find my soldier dumb. 

He has seen the starry hours, 
And the springing of the flowers, 
And the fairy things that pass, 
In the forests of the grass. 

He has lived, a little thing, 
In the grassy woods of spring, 
Done, if he could tell me true, 
Just as I should like to do. 

In the silence he has heard 
Talking bee and lady-bird, 
And the butterfly has flown 
O'er him as he lay alone. 

Not a word will he disclose, 
Not a word of all he knows. 
I must lay him on the shelf 
And make up the tale myself.

THE ENDLESS STORY 

A tiny drop of water 
Within the ocean lay; 

A coaxing sunbeam caught her 
And bore her far away; 

Up, up, and higher still, they go.

A little cloud lay sleeping 
Upon the azure sky; 

But soon she fell a weeping, 
As cold the wind rushed by

And cried and cried herself away 
It was a very rainy day.

Ran trickling through the ground 
And set the brooklets drinkiDg 

In all the country round; 

But some with laughing murmur said,

EXTRACT FROM "THE ANCIENT MARINER. 

COLERIDGE. 

And now the storm-blast came, and he 
Was tyrannous and strong; 

He struck with his o'er-taking wings, 
And chased us south along. 

And now there came both mist and snow, 
And it grew wondrous cold; 

And ice, mast-high, came floating by, 
As green as emerald. 

And through the drifts the snowy cliffs 
Did send a dismal sheen: 

Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken — 
The ice was all between. 

The ice was here, the ice was there, 
The ice was all around; 

It cracked and growled, and roared and howled, 
Like noises in a swound ! 

At length did cross an albatross, 
Through the fog it came; 

As if it had been a Christian's soul, 
We hailed it in God's name. 

It ate the food it ne'er had eat. 
And round and round it flew; 

The ice did split with a thunder-fit, 
The helmsman steered us through ! 

And a good south wind sprung up behind: 
The albatross did follow, 

And every day, for food or play, 
Came to the mariner's hollo! </seg>

With all the blue ethereal sky,

And publishes to every land

Soon as the evening shades prevail, 
The moon takes up the wondrous tale: 
And nightly, to the listening earth, 
Repeats the story of her birth: 
Whilst all the stars that round her burn, 
And all the planets in their turn, 

Confirm the tidings as they roll, 
And spread the truth from pole to pole. 

What though, in solemn silence, all 
Move round the dark terrestrial ball ; 
What though no real voice, nor sound, 
Amidst their radiant orbs be found? 
In reason's ear they all rejoice, 

And utter forth a glorious voice; 
Forever singing as they shine, 
"The hand that made us is divine." 

SIR ROGER AND WILL WIMBLE. 

As I was yesterday morning walking with Sir Roger before 
his house, a country fellow brought him a huge fish, which, he 
told him, Mr. William Wimble had caught that very morning; 
and that he presented it, with his service to him, and intended to 
come and dine with him. At the same time he delivered a letter, 
which my friend read to me as soon as the messenger left him. </seg>

SPECIAL DAYS. 

"Sir Roger: — I desire you to accept of a jack, which is the 
best I have caught this season. I intend to come and stay with 
you a week, and see how the perch bite in the Black River. I 
observed with some concern the last time I saw you upon the 
bowling-green, that your whip wanted a lash to it; I will bring 
half a dozen with me that I twisted last week, which I hope will 
serve you all the time you are in the country. I have not been 
out of the saddle for six days last past, having been at Eton with 
Sir John's eldest son. He takes to his learning hugely. I am, 
sir, Your humble servant, 

Will Wimble." 

This extraordinary letter, with the message which accompanied 
it, made me very curious to know the character and quality of 
the gentleman who sent them, which I found to be as follows : 
Will Wimble is younger brother to a baronet, and descended of 
the ancient family of the Wimbles. He is now between forty 
and fifty; but being bred to no business and born to no estate, he 
generally lives with his elder brother as superintendent of his 
game. 1 le hunts a pack of dogs better than any man in the 
country, and is very famous for finding out a hare. He is 
extremely well versed in all the little handicrafts of an idle man ; 
He makes a May- fly to a miracle; and furnishes the whole 
country with angle-rods. As he is a good-natured, officious fellow, 
and very much esteemed on account of his family, he is a 
welcome guest at every house, and keeps up a good correspondence 
among all the gentlemen about him. He carries a tulip-root 
in his pocket from one to another, or exchanges a puppy between 
a couple of friends that live perhaps in the opposite sides of the 
county. Will is a particular friend of all the young heirs, whom 
he frequently obliges with a net that he has weaved, or a setting 
dog that he has trained himself. These gentleman-like manufactures 
and obliging little humors make Will the darling of the 
country. 

Sir Roger was proceeding in the character of him, when we 
saw him make up to us with two or three hazel twigs in his 
his hand that he had cut in Sir Roger's woods as he came 
through them, in his way to the house. I was very much </seg>

            <seg id="p207">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT S REPORT. 

pleased to observe on one side the hearty and sincere welcome 
with which Sir Roger received him, and on the other, the secret 
joy which his guest discovered at the sight of the good old 
knight. After the first salutes were over, Will desired Sir Roger 
to lend him one of his servants to carry a set of shuttlecocks he 
had with him in a little box to a lady that lived about a mile off, 
to whom it seems he had promised such a present for above this 
half year. Sir Roger's back was no sooner turned but honest 
Will began to tell me of a large cock-pheasant that he had 
sprung in the neighboring woods, with two or three other adventures 
of the same nature. 

In the midst of this discourse the bell rung to dinner,where the 
gentleman I have been speaking of had the pleasure of seeing 
the huge jack he had caught served up for the first dish in a most 
sumptuous manner. Upon our sitting down to it he gave us a 
long account of how he had hooked it, played with it, foiled it, 
and at length drew it out upon the bank, with other particulars that 
lasted all the first course. 

Upon withdrawing into my room after dinner, I was secretly 
touched with compassion towards the honest gentleman who had 
dined with us, and could not but consider, with a great deal of 
concern, how so good a heart and such busy hands were wholly 
employed in trifles; that so much humanity should be so little 
beneficial to others, and so much industry so little advantageous 
to himself. The same temper of mind and application 
to affairs might have recommended him to the public esteem, and 
have raised his fortune in another station in life. What good to 
his country and to himself might not a trader or merchant have 
done with such useful though ordinary qualifications? 

Will Wimble's is the case of many a younger brother of a 
great family, who had rather see their children starve like gentlemen, 
than thrive in a trade or profession that is beneath their 
quality. This humor fills several parts of Europe with pride and 
beggary. It is the happiness of a trading nation, like ours, that 
the younger sons, though incapable of any liberal art or profession, 
may be placed in such a way of life as may perhaps enable 
them to vie with the best of their family; accordingly we find </seg>

CASABIANCA. 

(In the Battle of the Nile, described by Southey in the Life of NeUon, the 
Orient took tire and was blown up. Among the hundreds who perished 
were the commodore, Casablanca, and his son, a boy about ten years old. 
Young Casabianca remained at his post after the ship had taken fire and all 
the guns had been abandoned, and perished in the explosion of the vessel 
when the flames reached the powder. The following poem by Felicia 
Brown Heraans commemorates this event:) 

The boy stood on the burning desk. 
Whence all but he had fled; 

The flame that lit the battle's wreck 
Shone round him o'er the dead. 

Yet beautiful and bright he stood, 
As born to rule the storm — 

A creature of heroic blood, 

A proud, though childlike form. 

The names rolled on: he would not go 
Without his father's word; 

That father faint in death below, 
His voice no longer heard. 

He called aloud: "Say, father, say 
If yet my task is done '." 

He knew not that the chieftain lay 
Unconscious of his son. 

"Speak, father!" once again he cried, 
"If I may yet be gone !" 

And but the booming shots replied, 
And fast the flames rolled on. 

Upon his brow he felt their breath, 
And in his waving hair, 

And looked from that lone poet of death 
In still yet brave despair; 

And shouted but once more aloud, 
"My father, must I stay?" 

While o'er him fast, through sail and shroud, 
The wreathing fires made way. </seg>

They wrapped the ship in splendor wild, 
They caught the Sag on high, 

And streamed above the gallant child 
Like banners in the sky. 

There came a burst of thunder-sound: 
The boy !— oh, where was he? 

Ask of the winds that far around 
With fragments strewed the sea! 

With mast, and helm, and pennon fair 
That well had born their part; 

But the noblest that perished there 
Was that young faithful heart ! 

PLAN OF INTERESTING PUPILS 

Miss Catherine Foos, one of the teachers in the fourth grade 
at the Comenius school, Omaha, is utilizing the public library to a 
very considerable and successful degree in the course of her 
work. Her method involves a good deal of additional labor, but 
the results have been so excellent that the time she has thus spent 
has amply repaid her. 

A good many of the teachers advise their scholars to use the 
public library, but it ordinarily ends by simply suggesting the 
books the children should draw. Miss Foos, however, goes 
farther. Once every month she goes to the library building and 
spends several hours among the shelves in personally selecting 
the books she desires her scholars to peruse. She chooses forty 
and these are conveyed by the school supply wagon and left at 
her room. During the next thirty days the books are circulated 
among the scholars in the room and are then carried back to the 
library. Another batch of forty, again selected by Miss Foos, is 
brought back. 

There is considerable work involved in the selection of forty 
new and proper books each month, but Miss Foos has the satisfaction 
of knowing that her scholars have suitable reading. The 
plan is unquestionably to the advantage of the children. 

Miss Catherine Foos has almost ready for publication her book 
of primary reading, which she has been compiling. Some of the 
material has been submitted to Alice W. Cooley, superintendent 
of the primary work in the Minneapolis schools, and has been </seg>

highly commended by her. The book is to be used in public

Come, let us join in glad bosana, 

Earnest and clear; 

Greeting with songs our lovely banner, 
Pride of our country dear. 

Praise to the brave who, noblv daring 
On land and sea, 

Gave their heroic lives in sharing 
All for the flag of the free.

See aloft its colors gleaming, 
Bright as morning dew '. 

Far up the heights of glory streaming — 
Long wave the Red, White, and Blue! 

Hail we the sign and sacred token 
Our fathers gave 

That faith in freedom is not broken 
Long as the flag shall wave. 

Then guard with life their trust confiding; 
Hold it secure! 

Never our love for it be hiding,— 
Only the brave shall endure! 

If hate or envy come designing 
Our flag to mar— 

With loyal hearts and arms combining, 
They shall not hurt one star! 

Thus, while we heed with true devotion 
Our flag's command, 

So will it wave from peak to ocean, 
Proud of its own native land.

SILAS DRESSES THE BABY. 

Silas Marner's determination to keep the "tramp child" was 
a matter of hardly less surprise in the village than the robbery 
of his money. That softening of feeling toward him which 
dated from his misfortune, that merging of suspicion and dislike 
in a rather contemptuous pity for him as lone and crazy, was </seg>

now accompanied by a more active sympathy, especially among 
the women. 

Among the notable mothers, Dolly Winthrop was the one 
whose neighborly offices were the most acceptable to Marner, 
for they were rendered without any show of bustling instruction. 
Silas had shown her the half guinea given to him by Godfrey, 
and had asked her what he should do about getting some clothes 
for the child. 

"Eh, Master Marner," said Dolly, "there's no call to buy no 
more nor a pair o' shoes; for I've got the little petticoats as 
Aaron wore five years ago, and it's ill spending money on them 
baby -clothes, for the child '11 grow like the grass i' May, bless it 
— that it will." 

And the same day Dolly brought her bundle, and displayed to 
Marner, one by one, the tiny garments in their due order of succession, 
most of them patched and darned, but clean and neat as 
fresh spring herbs. This was the introduction to a great ceremony 
with soap and water, from which Baby came out in new 
beauty and sat on Dolly's knee, handling her toes and chuckling 
and patting her palms together with an air of having made 
several discoveries about herself, which she communicated by 
alternate sounds of "gug-gug-gug" and "Mammy." 

"Anybody 'ud think the angels in Heaven couldn't be 
prettier," said Dolly, rubbing the golden curls and kissing them. 
"And to think of its being covered with them dirty rags — and 
the poor mother — frozen to death ! But there's one that took 
care of it, and brought it to your door, Master Marner. The 
door was open, and it walked in over the snow, like as if it had 
been a little starved robin. Didn't you say the door was open?" 

"Yes," said Silas, meditatively, "yes — the door was open. 
The money's gone, I don't know where, and this came from — 
I don't know where." 

"Ah," said Dolly, with toothing gravity, "it's like the night 
and the morning, and the sleeping and the waking, and the rain 
and the harvest, one goes and the other comes, and we know 
nothing about how or where. You'll happen to be a bit </seg>

bothered with it while it's so little; but I'll come, and welcome, 
and see to it for you." 

"Thank you — kindly," said Silas, hesitating a little. "I'll be 
glad if you'll tell me things. But," he added uneasily, leaning 
forward to look at baby with some jealousy, as she was resting 
her head backward against Dolly's arm, and eyeing him contentedly 
from a distance — "But I want to do things for it myself, 
else it may get fond o' somebody else, and not fond o' me. I've 
been used to fending for myself in the house — I can learn, I can 
learn." 

"Eh, to be sure," said Dolly, gently, "I've seen men as are 
wonderfully handy with children. The men are awkward and 
contrary mostly, God help 'em — but when the drink's out of 
'em, they aren't unsensible. You see this goes first, next the 
skin," proceeded Dolly, taking up the little shirt and putting 
it on. 

"Yes," said Marner, docilely, bringing his eyes very close, 
that they might be initiated in the mysteries; whereupon Baby 
seized his head with both her small arms, and put her lips 
against his face with purring noises. 

"See there," said Dolly, with a woman's tender tact, 4t she's 
fondest o' you. She wants to go on your lap, I'll be bound. 
Go, then; take her, Master Marner; you can put the things on, 
and then you can say as you've done for her from the first of her 
coming to you." 

Marner took her on his lap, trembling with an emotion mysterious 
to himself, at something unknown dawning on His life. 
He took the garments from Dolly, and put them on under her 
teaching; interrupted, of course, by Baby's gymnastics. 

"There, then! why, you take to it quite easy, Master Marner," 
said Dolly; but what shall you do when you are forced to sit in 
your loom ? For she'll get busier every day — she will, bless her. 
It's lucky as you've got that high hearth instead of a grate, for 
that keeps the fire more out of her reach; but if you've got anything 
as can be spilt or broke, or as is fit to cut her fingers off, 
she'll be at it — and it is but right you should know." 

Silas meditated awhile in some perplexity. I'll tie her to the </seg>

leg o' the loom," he said at last — "tie her with a good long strip 
of something." 

"Well, mayhap that'll do, as it's a little gal, for they're easier 
persuaded to sit in one place nor the lads. I'll bring you my 
little chair, and some bits of red rag and things for her to play 
with ; and she'll sit and chatter to them as if they were alive."

DOUGLAS AND MARMION. 
Not far advanced wag morning- day, 

When Marmion did his troop array 
To Surrey's camp to ride: 

He had safe conduct for his band. 

Beneath the royal seal and hand. 
And Douglas gave a guide. 

The train from out the castle drew. 
But Marmion stopped to bid adieu: 

"Though something I might plan," he said, 
"Of cold respect to stranger guest, 

Sent hither by your King's behest, 
While in Tantallon's towers I staid, 

Part we in friendship from your land, 

And, noble earl, receive my hand." 

But Douglas round him drew his cloak, 

Folded his arms, and thus he spoke: 

"My manors, halls, and bowers shall still 

Be open at my sovereign's will, 

To each one whom he lists, howe'er 

Unmeet to be the owner's peer. 
My castles are my King's alone, 

From turret to foundation-stone — 
The hand of Douglas is his own, 
And never shall in friendly grasp 
The hand of such as Marmion clasp.' 

Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire, 

And shook his very frame for ire. 
And— "This to me!" he said,— 

"And 'twere not for thy hoary beard, 

Such hand as Marmion's had not spared 
To cleave the Douglas' head! 

And first I tell thee, haughty peer, 

He who does England's message here, 
Although the meanest in her state, 
May well, proud Angus, be thy mate: 

And, Douglas, more I tell thee here, 
Even in thy pitch of pride, </seg>

SPECIAL DAYS. 

Here in thy hold, thy vassals near, 
(Nay, never look upon your lord, 
And lay your hands upon your sword) 

I tell thee, thou'rt defied! 

And if thou saidst T am not peer 
To any lord in Scotland here, 
Lowland or Highland, far or near. 
Lord Angus, thou hast lied!" 

On the earl's cheek the flush of rage 
O'ercame the ashen hue of age: 

Fierce he broke forth: "And darest thou then 
To beard the lion in his den, 

The Douglas in his hall? 

And hopest thou hence unscathed to go? 
No, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no! 
Up drawbridge, grooms — what, warder, ho! 

Let the portcullis fall." 

Lord Marmion turned,— well w»s his need — 
And dashed the rowels in his steed: 

Like arrow through the archway sprung, 
The ponderous gate behind him rung: 
To pass there was such scanty room, 
The bars descending raised his plume. 
The steed along the drawbridge flies, 
Just as it trembled on the rise; 

Nor lighter does the swallow skim 
Along the smooth lake's level brim: 

And when Lord Marmion reached his band, 
He halts, and turns with clenched hand, 
And shout of loud defiance pours, 

And shook his gauntlet at the towers. 

"Horse, horse!" the Douglas cried, "and chase!' 
But soon he reigned his fury's pace: 

"A royal messenger he came, 

Though most unworthy of the name. 
St. Mary mend my fiery mood! 
Old age ne'er cools the Douglas blood, 
I thought to slay him where he stood. 
'Tis pity of him too," he cried: 

"Bold can he speak, and fairly ride, 
I warrant him a traitor tried." 
With this his mandate he recalls, 
And slowly seeks his castle halls.

QUALITY OF MEKCY. 

The quality of mercy is not strain 'd, 
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven 
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest; 
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes: 
Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes 
The throned monarch better than his crown: 
His scepter shows the force of temporal power, 
The attribute to awe and majesty, 

Wherein doth sit the fear and dread of kings; 
But mercy is above this scepter 'd sway; 
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, 

It is an attribute to God himself: 

And earthly power doth then show likest God's 
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, 
Though justice be thy plea, consider this, 
That, in the course of justice, none of us 
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; 
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render 
The deeds of mercy.

O Thou, whose eye of love 
Looks on us from above, 

Thine are the waving fields, 
Thy hand the harvest yields; 

Low at Thy throne 

And unto Thee 

We come to Thee and pray 
That, gleaning day by day, 
Our grateful hearts alway 

To whom for rain and dew, 
And skies of sunny blue, 
Our love and praise are due, 

Thy hand may own. 

We bend the knee. 

And when beneath the trees 
In fairer fields than these 

Our glad feet roam, 

There where the bright harps ring, 
May we our gleanings bring, 

And in Thy presence sing, 
Our harvest home.

THE PUMPKIN. 

J. G. WHITT1BB 

(On receipt of a pumpkin pie. ) 

Ah ! on Thanksgiving Day when from east and from west, 
From north and from south come the pilgrim and guest, 
When the gray-haired New Englander sees round his board 
The old broken links of affection restored; 

When the care-wearied man seeks his mother once more, 
And the worn matron smiles where the girl smiled before, — 
What moistens the lip and brightens the eye, 

What calls back the past, like the rich pumpkin pie? 
Oh, fruit loved of boyhood! the old days recalling, 

When wood-grapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling: 
When wild, ugly faces we carved in its skin, 

Glaring out through the dark with a candle within; 

When we laughed round the corn heap, with hearts all in tune, 
Our chair a broad pumpkin, our lantern the moon, — 

Telling tales of the fairy who traveled like steam, 
In a pumpkin-shell coach, with two rats for her team. 
Then thanks for thy present none sweeter or better 
E'er smoked from an oven or circled a platter. 
Fairer hands never wrought at a pastry more fine, 
Brighter eyes never watched o'er its baking than thine. 
And the prayer which my mouth is too full to express. 
Swells my heart that thy shadow may never be less; 
That the days of thy lot may be lengthened below, 
And the fame of thy worth like a pumpkin vine grow, 
And thy life be as sweet and its last sunset sky, 
Golden tinted and fair as thy own pumpkin pie! </seg>

HISTORICAL SKETCH. 

The first Thanksgiving Day kept according to official proclamation 
in the new world was appointed by Governor Bradford, 
of the Plymouth colony, for four days just after the middle of 
October, 1621. Men were sent out into the woods for wild turkey, 
which makes that the traditional menu for their remote 
descendants. 

It would be a mistake to assume that those fifty-five settlers 
who had the first Thanksgiving did nothing but eat and attend 
Divine worship during their festival. They had no football at 
that time, but they had their preliminary hunt, their shooting 
with the Indians at the mark, and "other recreations." In writing 
about the first Thanksgiving, Edward Winslow forgot to 
even mention the sermon, the same mistake that our papers will 
be accused of making this year. Here is Winslow's letter, written 
to his friends soon after the festival: 

"Our harvest being gotten in, our governor, Wm. Bradford, 
sent four men on fowling, so that we might, after a special manner, 
rejoice together after we had gathered the fruit of our labors. 
They four in one day killed as much fowl as, with a little help 
beside, served the company almost a week, at which time, 
amongst other recreation, we exercised our arms, many of the 
Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest their greatest 
king, Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three days we 
entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five deer, 
which they brought to the plantation and bestowed on our governor 
and upon the captain, Miles Standish, and others, and 
although it be not always so plentiful as it was at this time with 
us, yet by the goodness of God we are so far from want that 
we often wish you partakers of our plenty." 

Thanksgiving Day had been observed by some of the colonies 
from the time of the "First Thanksgiving." Massachusetts 
appointed a day of thanksgiving in 1633, ' n I^34, in 1637, in 
1638, in 1639, in 1651, in 1658, and again in 1680, when it 
became an annual state custom. The Dutch governors of New 
York appointed occasional days of Thanksgiving as early as </seg>

SPECIAL DAYS. 

1644. The first National Thanksgiving Day was observed in 
1 789, to give thanks for the adoption of the Constitution. In 1795 
Prsident Washington appointed another on account of the suppression 
of an insurrection. The first annual harvest Thanksgiving 
Day was appointed by President Lincoln, November 26, 
1S63, and the day has been observed each year since that date.

THANKSGIVING EVE. 

Hand in hand through the city streets, 
As the chill November twilight fell, 

Two childish figures walk up and down — 
The bootblack Teddie and sister Nell. 

With wistful eyes they peer in shops, 

Where dazzling lights from the windows shine 
On golden products from farm and field, 

And luscious fruits from every clime. 

"O Teddie," said Nell, "let's play to-night 
These things are ours, and let's uagsuppose Q 

We can choose whatever we want to eat, 
It might come true, perhaps — who knows?" 

Two pinched little faces press the pane, 
And eagerly plan for the morrow's feast 

Of dainties their lips will never touch, 
Forgetting their hunger awhile at least. 

The pavement was cold for the shoeless feet, 
Ted's jacket was thin; he shivered and said, 

"Let's go to a place and choose tome clothes." 
"Agreed," said Nell, and away they sped. 

To a furrier's shop, ablaze with light, 

In whose fancied warmth they placed their hands, 
And play their scanty garments are changed 

For softest furs from far-off lands. 

"A grand Thanksgiving we'll have," said Nell, 
"These make-believe things seem almost true; 

I've most forgot how hungry I was, 
And, Teddie, I'm almost warm; aren't you?" 

Oh, happy hearts, that rejoice to-day 
In all the bounty the season brings, 

Have pity on those who vainly strive 
To be warm and fed on imaginings!

AFTER HARVEST. 

\ 

The days of harvest are past again, 

We have cut our cora, and bound our sheaves, 
A nd (fathered the apples green and gold, 

'Mid the brown and crimson orchard leaves, 
With a flowery promise the springtime came, 

With the building birds and blossoms sweet; 
But oh! the honey, the fruit and wine! 

And oh! the joy of the corn and wheat! 
What was the bloom to the apple's gold, 

And what the flower to the honeycomb? 
What was the song that sped the plow, 
To the joyful song of the harvest home? 

So sweet, so fair are the days of youth: 
So full of promise, so nay with song: 

To the lilt of joy and the dream of love 
Right merrily go the hours along: 

But yet in the harvest time of life 
We never wish for its spring again. 

We have tried our strength, and proved our heart! 
Our hands have gathered the golden grain: 

We have eaten with sorrow her bitter bread. 
And love has fed us with honeycomb; 

Sweet youth we can never weep for thee 
When life has come to its harvest home. 

When the apples are red on the topmost bough, 
We do not think of their blooming hour: 

When the vine hangs low with its purple fruit, 
We do not long for its pale green flower: 

So then, when hopes of our spring at last 
Are found in the fruit of the busy brain, 

In the heart's sweet love, in the hand's brave toil, 
We shall not wi9h for our youth again, 

Ah, no. we shall say, with a glad content, 
"After the years of our hard unrest, 

Thank God for our ripened hopes and toil! 
Thank God, the harvest of life is best!"

BERTIE'S THANKSGIVING. 

Hurrah for Thanksgiving! "What for?" did you say? 
Why, sir, if you don't know, it's queer; 

I'm going to grandpa's; say, ain't that enough 
To "rattle" most any boy here? </seg>

SPECIAL DAYS. 

Did you have a grandpa when you were a boy? 
And didn't you go once a year 

To help him eat all the jolly good things 
He fixes for Thanksgiving cheer? 

It's grandma, I s'pose though, that makes all the pies, 
Such stunning ones, pumpkin and mince, 

And" puddings and cakes, with frosting and tarts 
That's quite good enough for a prince. 

And there's the turkey, and chicken, and ducks 
All stuffed with such jolly good stuff. 

A boy has to eat till he can't eat any more, 
And then he ain't got half enough. 

There's a cute little pig with some corn in it's mouth; 
You'd think he was going to squeal; 

It seems most a pity to eat him up, too, 
But he beats them all, by a deal. 

And then in the evening there's apples and nuts, 
And games till the old clock strikes ten, 

Then all the small cousins must go off to bed 
And dream it all over again. 

But sometimes the dreams don't seem half so nice: 
There's Injuns, and bears, and sly mice, 

And they dance on your stomach and pull at your scalp. 
In a manner that ain't very nice. 

But they all run away with the bright morning sun, 
And we all bundle up and go home. 

Then hurrah for Thanksgiving! I say, sir, don't you? 

I wish it would hurry and come.

THE TROUBLE. 

'Twas the jolliest sort of a party; 

There were lassies and laddies a score, 
With ices and cakes, nuts and candy, 

And all kinds of goodies in store. 

"Did you have a good time, dear?" we questioned, 
Next morning, our eight-year-old Ned. 

He sighed. '"Twas the best time I could have 
Cnless I was bigger," he said. </seg>

NOVEMBER. 

1UCI CAST 

The leaves are fading and falling, 
The winds are rough and wild, 

And the loveliest wayside blossom, 
Will shine with the sun and dew 

The birds have ceased their calling, 
And let me tell you my child, 

The leaves to-day are whirling, 
The brooks are all dry and dumb, 

Though day by day as it closes, 
Doth darker and colder grow; 

But let me tell you, my darling, 
The spring is sure to come. 

The roots of the bright red roses 
Will keep alive in the snow. 

There must be rough, cold weather. 
And wind and rain so wild, 

And when the winter is over, 
The boughs will get new leaves, 

Not all good things together, 
Come to us here, my child. 

The quail come back to the clover, 
And the swallow back to the eaves. 

So, when some dear joy lores 
Its beauteous summer glow, 

The robin will wear on his bosom, 
A vest that is bright and new, 

Think how the roots of the roses 
Are kept alive in the snow. 

CHILDREN, THANK GOD. 

Children, thank God for these great trees, 
That fan the land with every breeze; 
Whose drooping branches form cool bowers, 
Where you can spend the summer hours, 

For these thank God. 

For fragrant sweets of blossoms bright 
Whose beauty gives you such delight, 
For the soft grass beneath your feet. 
For new-mown hay, and clover sweet, 

For all, thank God. 

The very cows that 1 ie and doze 
Beneath the tjee in glad repose: 
The birds that in their branches sing, 
And make the air with music ring, 

All these thank God. 

Oh, thank God for the radiant sky, 
Whose varying beauty charms the eye, 
Now gray and dark, now blue and bright, 
Unfailing source of pure delight, 

For this thank God. 

He gives the life to everything, 

To beasts that roar, and birds that sing; 
But thought and speech he gave to men, 
While beasts are dumb: O, children, then 

For this thank God.

PHCIB* CART 

O men, grown sick with toil and care. 
Leave for a while the crowded mart; 

O women, sinking with despair; 
Weary of limb and faint of heart, 

Forget your years to-day and come 
As children back to childhood's home. 

Follow again the winding rills, 
Go to the places where you went 

When, climbing up the summer hills, 
In their green laps you sat content, 

And softly leaned your head to rest 
On Nature's calm and peaceful breast. 

Walk through the sere and fading wood, 
So slightly trodden by your feet, 

When all you knew of life was good, 
And all you dreamed of life was sweet, 

And ever fondly looking back 

O'er youthful love's enchanted track. 

Taste the ripe fruits from the orchard boughs, 
Drink from the mossy well once more; 

Breathe fragrance from the crowded mows 
With fresh, sweet clover running o'er, 

And count the treasurers at your feet, 
Of silver rye and golden wheat. 

Go sit beside the hearth again. 
Whose circle once was glad and gay: 

And if, from out the precious chain, 
Some shining links have dropped away, 

Then guard with tender heart and hand 
The remnant of thy household band. 

Draw near the board with plenty spread, 
And if, in the accustomed place, 

You see the father's reverend head, 
Or mother's patient, loving face, 

Whate'er your life may have of ill, 
Thank God that these are left vou still. 

And though where home has been you stand 
To-day in alien loneliness: 

Though you may clasp no brother's hand, 
And claim no sister's tender kiss; 

Though with no friend nor lover nigh, 
The past is all your company. </seg>

THE BILL OF FARE. 

Pies of pumpkin, apple, mince, 
Jams and jellies, peaches, quince, 

Purple grapes and apples red, 

Cakes and nuts and gingerbread, 
That's Thanksgiving. 

Turkey! O, a great big fellow! 
Fruits, all ripe and rich and mellow, 

Everything that's nice to eat, 

More than I can now repeat, 
That's Thanksgiving. 

Lots and lots of jolly fun, 
Games to play and races run, 
All as happy as can be 

For 'tis happiness, you see, 
Makes Thanksgiving. 

We must thank the One who gave 
All the good things that we have: 

That is why we keep the day 

Set aside, our mamma's say, 
For Thanksgiving.

THE FIRST THANKSGIVING DAY. 

Children, do you know the story 
Of the first Thanksgiving Day, 

Founded by our Pilgrim Fathers 
In that time so far away? 

They had given for religion 

Wealth and comfort — yes, and more — 
Left their homes and friends and kindred, 

For a bleak and barren shore. 

On New England's rugged headlands, 
Now where peaceful Plymouth lies. 

There they built their rough log cabins, 
"Xeath the cold, forbidding skies. </seg>

SPECIAL DAYS. 

And too often e'en the bravest 
Felt his blood run cold with dread, 

Lest the wild and savage red-man 
Burn the roof above his head. 

Want and sickness, death and sorrow, 
Met their eyes on every hand; 

And before the spring had reached them 
They had buried half their band. 

But their noble, brave endurance 
Was not exercised in vain; 

Summer brought them brighter prospects, 
Ripening seed and waving grain. 

And the patient Pilgrim mothers, 
As the harvest time drew near, 

Looked with happy, thankful faces 
At the full corn in the ear. 

So the governor, William Bradford, 
In the gladness of his heart, 

To praise God for all His mercies, 
Set a special day apart. 

That was in the autumn, children, 
Sixteen hundred twenty-one: 

Scarce a year from when they landed, 
And the colony begun. 

And now when in late November, 
Our Thanksgiving feast is spread, 

'Tis the same time-honored custom 
Of those Pilgrims long since dead. 

We shall never know the terrors 
That they braved years, years ago: 

But for all their struggles gave us, 
We our gratitude can show. 

And the children of New England, 
If they feast or praise or pray, 

Should bless God for those brave Pilgrims. 
And their first Thanksgiving Day.

"And now," said the governor, gazing abroad on the piled-up store 
Of the sheaves that dotted the clearings and covered the meadows o'er, 

" 'Tis meet that we render praises because of this yield of grain; 
'Tis meet that the Lord of the harvest be thanked for His sun and rain </seg>

"And therefore, I, William Bradford (by the grace of God to-day, 
And the franchise of this good people), governor of Plymouth, say,— 
Through virtue of vested power, — ye shall gather with one accord 
And hold in the month of November, Thanksgiving unto the Lord. 

He hath granted us peace and plenty, and the quiet we have sought so long 
He hath thwarted the wily savage, and kept him from wrack and wrong: 
And unto our feast the sachem shall be bidden, that he may know 
We worship his own Great Spirit, who maketh the harvests grow. 

"So shoulder your matchlocks, masters; there is hunting of all degrees 
And fishermen, take your tackle and scour for spoil the seas; 
And maidens and dames of Plymouth, your, delicate crafts employ 
To honor our first Thanksgiving, and make it a feast of joy. 

"We fail of the fruits and dainties, we fail of the old home cheer; 
Ah! these are the lightest losses, mayhap, that befall us here. 
But see! in the open clearings how golden the melons lie! 
Enrich them with sweets and spices, and give us the pumpkin-pie! 

So, bravely the preparations went on for the autumn feast; 

The deer and the bear were slaughtered: wild game from the greatest to leas 
Was heaped in the colony cabins; brown home-brew served for wine; 
And the plum and the grape of the forest for orange and peach and pine. 

At length came the day appointed; the snow had begun to fall, 
But the clang of the meeting-house belfry raDg merrily over all, 
And summoned the folk of Plymouth, who hastened with glad accord 
To listen to Elder Brewster as he fervently thanked the Lord. 

In his seat sat Governor Bradford: men, matrons, and maidens fair. 
Miles Standish and all his soldiers, with corslet and sword were there: 
And sobbing and tears and gladness had each in its turn the sway, 
For the grave of sweet Rose Standish o'ershadowed Thanksgiving Day. 

And when Massasoit. the sachem, sat down with his hundred braves. 
And ate the varied riches of gardens and woods and waves, 
And looked on the granaried harvest, with a blow on his brawny chest, 
He muttered: "The Good Spirit loves his white children best!" 

NUTTING-TIME.

Falling 'mong the leaflets brown.

Falling, dropping here and there, 
Making merry everywhere;

Run to catch them as they fall. </seg>

Falling, falling all around, 

Dropping, dropping to the ground, 
Gathering, gathering, hear the chime, 
'Tis the merry, merry nutting-time. 

Down they're coming, hear the sound, 
Lighting with a slight rebound, 
'Mong the leaves they may not hide, 
Quickly, quickly they're espied, 
Now they're coming down in showers, 
On the withered leaves and flowers, 
Something kindly shakes the trees, 
Hark! ir. is the merry breeze. 

Down among the rustling leaves, 
Like the busy, busy bees. 

Bustling, fumbling, o'er and o'er, 
All are gath'ring in their store. 
Of the golden autumn da&gt; s. 
Smiling thro' the mellow haze. 
None so gay, O, list the chime. 
As the merry, merry nutting-time. 

A THANKSGIVING SONG. 

Happy the days when the cowslips tipped their caps to the friendly sun, 
Happy the days when the merry work of the year was just begun, 
And happy days are these, my love, when the work of the year is done. 

Sweet was the time when showers of scent from the lilac tops were tossed, 
And sweet when the dancing feet of spring in the summer paths were lost; 
And cheerisome times are these, my love, when the air is sharp with frost. 

The summer wrought with a diligence, and her needle flashed amain, 
Her thread was red with the rosy sun, and white with the pearls of rain; 
And her needle is thrust in a folded case— the thread is snapped in twain. 

The sun is faded— Heigho! What then'? For the fire's heart is clear, 
And cellar and storehouse are brimming full— and have ye then no cheer? 
So let her sit in the chimney light and rest her— the tired year. 

Who would wish for the light to last till it dazzled the weary eye? 
Live and give, and carol away when the winds are piercing and high, 
And let the soul of the rose live on, when its day has drifted by. 

The grass will dry and the fruit will fall, and the sun will slip away. 
But the "merry heart," it "doeth good," when the days are short and gray, 
And the soul that sings in the storm shall find the true Thanksgiving Day.

My grandma's the loveliest lady, 
My grandpa's the jolliest man, 

We always go there for Thanksgiving, 
We fro in the sleigh with the span. 

O, all the aunts and the uncles 
Are there on Thanksgiving Day,; 

And there, too, are all of the cousins; 
How quickly the time flies away! 

And such a fine dinner of turkey 
And chicken and pudding and pies! 

There's no one who cooks like my grandma, 
And no one can beat her who tries. 

And then there are (fames in the evening, 

As 'round the big fireplace we sit 
And crack nuts and tell lots of stories 

And never are sleepy a bit. 

LITTLE PAUL'S THANKSGIVING. 

They tossed him and they squeezed him, 
And they kissed him one and all; 

They said, "You blessed, blessed boy!" 
And "Darling little Paul!" 

But they didn't give him turkey, 
Nor any pumpkin pie, 

And when the nuts and grapes went 'round 
They slyly passed him by. 

But he didn't seem to mind it, 
For in the sweetest way 

He sat and sucked his little thumb 
His first Thanksgiving Day.— Selected. 

A TRYING QUESTION, 

If turkeys were as tall as telegraph poles 
And ten times broader and fatter, 

Who'd do the carving 
To keep us from starving, 

And what could we use for a platter?

For every snowball that we tossed. 
And sleds and skates and all.

And bloodroot white as snow. 

We're thankful for the holidays 
That came with summer heat, 

And all the happy summer plays 
In grandma'* garden sweet. 

We're thankful for the autumn's store, 
When fields are bare and gray, 

And all the year that brings once more

DOWN TO SLKEP. 

November woods are bare and still, 
November days are clear and bright. 

Each noon bufns up the morning's chill, 
The morning's snow is gone by night. 
Each day my steps grow slow, grow light, 

As through the woods I reverent creep, 
Watching all things lie "down to sleep." 

{ never knew before what beds, 
Fragrant to smell and soft to touch, 

The forest sifts and shapes and spreads; 
I never knew before how much 
Of human sound there is in such 

Low tones as through the forest sweep 
When all wild things lie "down to sleep.*' 

Each day I find new coverlids 

Tucked in, and more sweet eyes shut tight; 
Sometimes the viewless mother bids 

Her ferns kneel down, full in my sight: 
I hear their chorus of "good night," 

And half I smile and half I weep, 
Listening while all lie "down to sleep."

THE REASON WHY. 

We learn it all in history— you didn't think I knew? 
Why, don't you s'pose I study my lessons? Course I do. 
The Pilgrim Fathers did it, they made Thanksgiving Day. 
Why? O; I don't remember; my history doesn't say, 
Or p'rhaps I wasn't listening when she was telling why: 
But if the Pilgrim Mothers were busy making pie, 
I s'pose they couldn't bother, and so that was the way 
It happened that the Fathers made our Thanksgiving Dav.

THE DAY WE LOVE. 

M. J. B. 

Of all the glad days of the year 
Thanksgiving Day's the best: 

What though the wind be chilly 
And clouds the sky may fill, 

Then fun and joy run riot 
And sorrow is at rest. 

And all without be dreary, 
If the heart is happy still! 

Then let us keep Thanksgiving 
And, looking through the years. 

We keep the day with feasting 
And enjoy it with a will, 

From the poor man in the valley We'll labor ever onward, 

Unharmed by doubts or fears. 

To the rich man on the hill. 

PEN PICTURE OF THE BURST THANKSGIVING DAY. 

'Tis the morn of the first Thanksgiving, 
The air it is crisp and cold, 

The snow lies in drifts in the highways, 
The wind is cutting and bold. 

From each lowly hut and cottage 
Unto the house of prayer, 

With rifles upon their shoulders 
The pilgrims assemble there. 

The dark, dreary winter is ended, 
The spring with its soft, gentle rain. 

And the warm sunny days of the summer 
Had ripened the much needed grain. 

Now each garner is bursting with plenty, 
Each heart, too, is filled with great joy. 

This winter no famine will haunt them, 
No terror their thoughts will employ. 

In the bleak little church in the village 
Are gathered stern men and fair maids: 

Their praises are joyfully ringing 
And echo o'er high hills and glades. 

Thus passed the first day of Thanksgiving, 
With thanks that e'er came from the heart: 

And no matter how humble his station, 
Each person in them took his part.

With eager-listened step she comes, 
Down the glad year into our homes: 
Comes in the sweet, remembered way, 
By the old path,— Thanksgiving Day! 

O'er melting snows and greening hills, 
Pass gardens quick with daffodils, 
Just stooping for the violets blue 

In pastures daisy-starred anew. 

And lightly o'er the furrows wide, 
And softly where green blades are spied, 
And pausing where the haying scents 
Betray midsummer's long contents. 

And faster now; for, ah! she hears 
The rustle of the husking ears; 
The thrust of sickles on the hills, 
The clatter of the toiling mills: 

The laughter of the harvesters, 

The mirth 'neath orchard trees that stirs, 
The fall of nuts on woodland paths, 
The wonder o'er brave aftermaths. 

The faster still through leaf-strown meads 
She goes, for now her pathway leads 

By folded flocks and fended store, 

And hearth-fire warm, and welcoming door- 

Till now unto her own she comes — 
Into a land of peace-girt homes, 

All blossomed thick with love and praise,— 
Earnest of new Thanksgiving days.

THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL MANUAL. 

THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL MANUAL. 

The University of Nebraska and the State Department of 

Education have just published a new High School Manual which 
governs their relation with the public high schools of the State. 
The new manual embodies the principles and recommendations 
in the reports of the State Association of Superintendents and 
Principals and of the National Educational Association. It 
assumes that the high schools are for the purpose of giving the 
best possible equipment or citizenship and success in life, and 
that such preparation is a most desirable foundation for college 

education. 

The standard State Courses of Study, while not insisted upon 

everywhere, are meant to furnish models for school authorities 
in arranging their courses of study. Portions of the Manual are

1. Where the subject is not specified, the school may select 
any important high school branch. 

2. The model course here given, is identical with course* 
No. 2 in the Manual for 1899, except that botany is transferred 
from the ninth to the tenth grade, in accordance with the recommendation 
of the Committee on College Entrance Requirements 
of the National Educational Association. This is recommended 
as a good general course for all schools. 

3. German should be begun in the second semester of grade 
XI and carried through grade XII, in schools where modern 
language can be properly taught. 

4. Vergil should not be taught by the smaller high schools. 

5. The larger schools in arranging additional courses, are 
advised to follow the Four Year course through the tenth grade. 
Special courses may be formed by making slight changes in 
grades XI and XII. 

Classical Course. — For the Classical course place Greek in 
grades XI and XII. Special attention is called to the importance 
of a Classical course wherever it is possible for a school to offer 
more than one course. School authorities should be careful not 
to misunderstand or misapply the arguments sometimes put 
forward against the study of the ancient times. Those urging 
these arguments usually mean only that duly organized and ably 
taught courses in modern languages are of equal worth, year for 
year, with study in classics. They do not mean to urge the 
neglect of Greek or Latin. There is probably not an educator 
of mark in the world, who would not regard the general 
ignorance of Greek throughout a community or a State as a 
profound misfortune.

of the Latin in the model course.

The University authorities urge upon all principals and superintendents 
the importance of maintaining not only thoroughness, 
but also breadth and symmetry in their high school curricula. 
Courses, therefore, which omit important lines of study, such as 
languages, ancient or modern, mathematics, or laboratory 
sciences, are not to be encouraged. 

UNIVERSITY ACCREDITED HIGH SCHOOLS CREDITS. 

i. Points offered by graduates of accredited high schools for 
admission to the University are determined from the standpoint 
of a high school, rather than from that of the University. 

2. A "credit point" is given for five recitations per week of 
not less than forty minutes each, during one semester of not less 
than eighteen weeks, adequate time being given for the preparation 
of each lesson. 

3. No credit will be given in any subject for less than one 
point. 

4. In science work partly done in laboratory, two periods of 
laboratory time are equivalent to one period of recitation with 
the preparation therefor. 

5. The total credit for history is six points; two in required 
(European) history, and four in optional (America or Eurpoean) 
history. 

6. The maximum credit in German or French for entrance 
to either college, is six points. 

7. For the year 1901, the minimum credits for entrance shall 
be twenty points; but upon a written recommendation of the 
superintendent or principal, the University may, in special cases&gt; 
admit candidates with less than the required number of points. 

8. The minimum credits for entrance shall be 21 in September, 
1902, 22 in 1903, 23 in 1904. and 25 in 1905. </seg>

9. In admitting to the University in September, the Enrollment 
Committee deals only with integral credits, but such 
integral credits may be in part composed of any fractional 
credits appearing on the certificates which the University issues 
to pupils on their graduation. It is, however, recommended 
that programs be so arranged as to make such fractional credits 
as few as possible. 

10. Pupils who apply for admission to the University before 
completing the course of study in their home school, will be 
subject to such examination as the University may require.

SCHOOLS ACCREDITED TO THE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. 

The School of Agriculture is designed to meet the demands 
for simple and practical instruction in agriculture. The course 
of study extends over three years, and includes the essential 
subjects in a high school course of study, together with other 
subjects relating particularly to agriculture. Graduates of this 
school are admitted to the course in agriculture in the University 
without further preparation. All students are required to take 
the technical work in agriculture. 

The list of schools accredited to the School of Agriculture 
shall consist of, ( 1 ) all high schools already fully accredited to 
the University; (2) town and village schools of nine, ten, and 
eleven grades doing satisfactory work as attested by inspection ; 
(3) counties approved upon inspection, in which the County 
Superintendent annually conducts eighth grade examination. 

The following rules shall govern the inspection and accrediting 
of schools : 

1. The schools fully accredited to the University shall be 
placed on the list accredited to the School of Agriculture 
without further inspection. 

2. There shall be a formal inspection of schools of nine, 
ten, and eleven grades, either by the University Inspector of </seg>

            <seg id="p240">
219 

THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL MASl'AL. 

Schools or by the County Superintendent, or other party authorized 
by the Inspector to make the inspection. The application 
for inspection shall be made by the Board of Education through 
its Secretary. 

3. Such counties as have adopted the State graded Course 
of Study, and have annual eighth grade examination, using the 
questions made out by the Sate Department of Education, shall 
be eligible to this list. The application for inspection shall be 
made by the County Superintendent. 

4. Reports similar in form to the reports of accredited high 
schools, shall be required of town and village schools, and of 
County Superintendent. 

5. The graduates of town and village schools placed on this 
list, besides being admitted without examination, shall receive 
certificates allowing full credit in the School of Agriculture for 
all work, completed in such schools. 

6. Pupils of country schools, in accredited counties, who pass 
the County Superintendent's eighth grade examination, shall 
receive certificates admitting them to the School of Agriculture 
without further examination. 

Note: — The Certificate of Admission to the School of Agriculture, will 
admit pupils also to the School of Mechanic Arts, and the School of Domestic 
Science. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 

NECESSARY LIMITATIONS, OF COURSES. 

Ambitious principals and school boards naturally desire their 
high school to win the highest possible number of credits. This, 
though in itself commendable, has produced an unfortunate tendency. 
It is not unusual to find a school of four to seven teachers 
attempting to carry as many years of high school work as 
are carried by schools of two to four hundred teachers. They 
not only attempt more work than can be done well, but more 
than the district can afford. This draws the attention and financial 
support from the lower grades and the school as a whole is 
seriously weakened. No high school can be permanently strong 
unless supported by efficient work in the lower grades. It has 
been deemed necessary, therefore, not only to require schools to </seg>

            <seg id="p241">
220 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

come up to certain standard of work, but also to discourage them 
from undertaking loo much. 

A SINGLE COURSe ADVISED. 

Except in the larger cities, it is a mistake to offer a variety of 
courses in the high school. Additional courses will increase the 
number of recitations, unnecessarily reduce the size of classes, 
diminish the time the teacher can give to each class, and prevent 
the most thorough and efficient work. The selection of studies 
may be desirable, but thorough and skilful teaching is far more 
important. The substitution of subjects should only be allowed 
in the smaller schools where the tastes and talents of the pupils 
necessitate such a substitution. The board should adopt a single, 
carefully selected course and let the undivided energy of 
teachers and pupils, be given to its pursuit. 

THE SENIOR COMMON BRANCHES. 

A full Four Year high school course, will give thirty-two credits. 
As only twenty-eight credits are necessary to fulfill the 
entrance requirements to the University, a high school can carry 
four credit points in other than preparatory subjects. It is suggested 
that at least two of these points be taken in the senior 
year in an intensive study of the essential common branches. 
This work is exceedingly essential, (i) in order to fix fundamental 
principles in the minds of those who are going out from 
high school, and will possibly receive no further instruction; (2) 
in order to give all high school graduates a connected view of 
the entire field of each of these subjects; (3) in order to give a 
better foundation for further study; (4) and in order to better 
prepare those who will teach in country schools. 

The work should mean much more than an ordinary review. 
It should be a careful study of the fundamental principles of each 
subject. Arithmetic and grammar should always be included in 
the subjects taken up. In case American history and physiology 
are not already in the high school course, these also should 
receive attention. A term can be profitably given to a review 
of algebra and arithmetic together. Six or eight weeks may 
be given to grammar. </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOL*. 

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

The rapid advance which has been made within the past few 
years in public sentiment and practice relating to the supervision 
of schools by professional superintendents is a matter of much 
significance. The value of a capable superintendent is no longer 
questioned. The existence of the school implies some kind of 
supervision. No business interest is successfully forwarded for 
any considerable length of time without a competent head to 
superintend. The city schools must have an officer who is peculiarly 
fitted by education, experience and special aptitude to give 
general direction and symmetry to the work of the schools. He 
should be able to manage and direct the work of instruction and 
training in the schools, and to advise in the various matters 
which have to do with the work. He should know what constitutes 
the proper school equipment and furnishings, such as 
text-books, reference books, apparatus, etc. But these are only 
a few of the duties — the course of study, the proper classification, 
and promotion of pupils, the recommendation and assigning to 
places of teachers are matters upon which the efficiency of the 
schools depend. The moral character of the superintendent is a 
matter of vital importance, and school boards usually take this 
into serious account in electing a superintendent. 

While it is so urgent that there be a competent superintendent 
for each city school, who shall actually be clothed with power 
enough to work out his plans, it is even more urgent that the 
rural schools, in which are to be found so many poorly trained 
and inexperienced teachers, shall have effective supervision. 

While there is always room for improvement, we doubt if the 
county or city schools of any State have a more progressive and 
successful body of superintendents than are to be found in Nebraska. 


The reports that follow will be of general interest, since they 
show the marked advancement that has been made in the schools 
of the State in the past few years. </seg>

ADAMS COUNTY. 

The schools of Adams county are probably in as good a con- 

dition as they have ever been in the history of the county. The 
educational spirit in the county has been perceptibly augmented 
during the past two years through the continuous labors of both 
teachers and county superintendent. Nearly every rural school 
is now supplied with a complete set of up-to-date text books, 
and many of our schools have added to this a well selected school 
library. Besides these, many improvements have been made too 
numerous to mention. If the expenditure of school moneys for 
improving and equipping our schools with better facilities is all 
the evidence needed to prove a healthy educational spirit, Adams 
county has indeed established an exemplary record. If the educational 
spirit finds expression in school attendance and profes- 

sional interest, then the spirit is somewhat less manifest. 
The average school attendance during the last four years has 

been 47 per cent, 47 per cent, 45 per cent and 49 per cent 
respectively, of our school population. How well the Compulsory 
Attendance law has been enforced may be 3een from 
the following tabulation, as taken from the county superintend- 

ent's annual reports

The professional interest among our teachers is only normal. 

Those who have had but one year's experience, or no experience 

at all, comprise fully 50 per cent of our present teaching force, 
and a large majority of this number take little or no interest in 

professional work.

become a teacher, twenty-five to thirty per cent of our teaching

force is supplemented annually by new material. If a year of 
pedagogical training was required by law before a person be 
permitted to teach, the sincerity of that person's motives to 
become a teacher in fact as well as in name would be pretty 
well established and the occupation of teaching would no longer 
be debased by those who seek only pecuniary advantages, and 
county superintendents would find it unnecessary to use executive 
authority to arouse professional interest. 

Prior to 1899, the Reading Circle work had been a complete 
failure. Most of the teachers purchased the necessary books to 
keep up appearances, while only a few of the most progressive 
teachers read the books or attended the meetings. During the 
last two years the Reading Circle work has been made the basis 
of professional requirements by the county superintendent. For 
the coming year all county teachers will be required to take a 
professional examination at the close of Institute based on 
Roark's Method of Education. 

There are three meetings of the County Association held 
yearly, and they are only moderately well attended. Papers and 
discussions are generally confined to only a few teachers, the 
majority, owing to timidity, will not participate. 

In addition to the County Association, a new organization was 
formed during the summer of 1899, known as tne Adams County 
Teachers' Cooperative Association. All the teachers of the 
county have pledged themselves to support this organization, the 
object of which is mutual assistance, protection and 10 promote 
professional interest. In my opinion, everything has been done 
that can be done in this county to arouse professional interest 
and professional responsibility among our teachers, and )et our 
present condition is far from being satisfactory. Nor do I believe 
it possible, owing to a continual change of teachers, to improve 
our present condition until the law insures us a teaching force 
with a greater degree of stability by requiring at least one year 
of training and study in the pedagogic sciences on the part of all 
applicants wishing to teach.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

ANTKLOPK COUNTY. 

During the past three years Antelope county has never been 
without an enthusiastic and well attended teachers' association. 
The sentiment for better teachers has been the watchword. In 
consequence no third grade certificates have been issued. The 
number of teachers has been reduced and the number of schools 
increased. There are at present one hundred and thirty-six certificates 
in force, and the number of teachers required is one 
hundred and thirty. The wages of teachers have increased 
$5.00 per month. 

Each teacher is provided with a course of study and expected 
to conform to it as nearly as possible. There have been twelve 
new school libraries established within the past two years. 

Last year the county was divided into three divisions, and 
each division held three meetings. "Adams' Herbartian Method" 
was outlined and used as a text in connection with association 
work. Suggestive questions were assigned each teacher for the 
ensuing meeting. These local meetings were closed by a general 
county meeting. 

This year we have already arranged for three associations, 
distributed in different parts of the county. We have adopted 
"Roark's Method in Teaching" as a text, and have had one very 
successful meeting. Teachers' grades in theory and art are 
based upon their association work. 

Until the time the Free HighS chool Law was declared unconstitutional, 
there were fifty-three students' certificates issued. 
Nearly all of the holders availed themselves of their privileges. 
As soon as the law was declared unconstitutional twenty-one 
left school. There can be no question but what the law was a 
great stimulant to the educational forces, and its failure to be 
effectual quite a disaster to the high schools. Each high school 
in the county lost money thereby. Oakdale High school lost 
nearly $200.00. 

We have four new districts and six new schoolhouses. I find 
a disposition among the older teachers to stay in the profession 
on account of the increased salaries. Last year we had only </seg>

twenty-four inexperienced teachers, while heretofore they have 
averaged fully one-third. 

I have managed to visit each of my schools at least once a 
year, and aim to visit twice or three times, but the number is so 
great and the official business has increased so much that it is impossible 
to do more. 

I feel justified in saying that Antelope county is keeping 
pace with its progressive State.

BOONE COUNTY. 

Boone county is rapidly increasing in population, the result of 
which is the formation of several new school districts ; five neat 
roomy school buildings were occupied for the first time Sept. 3. 
The county is, upon the whole, in a prosperous condition, educationally. 
Never before were the schools so nearly filled by 
experienced teachers. Only five who havd^had no experience 
are numbered with the teaching iorcesJf Teachers' salaries 
average higher than ever before, as nearly all of thejchools seem 
to appreciate a good teacher and are not afraid repay for her 
services. 

The County Teachers' Association meets three times this year. 
The first meeting was held October 27. A large number of the 
teachers were present. The purpose of the association is to 
bring the schools into closer harmony, and to acquaint the teachers 
with the plans presented in the "State Course of Study." 
This manual has been placed in the hands of every teacher in the 
county; while it isn't followed exactly, it is used as a guide with a 
view to higher education. 

Our county has been sadly neglected along the line of penmanship. 
I have visited all schools and found them making remarkable 
progress. I use the "Vertical Running Hand System." 1 
put cut charts of my own, and each teacher uses them. Next 
year, in connection with this, reading will be a specialty. 

Boone county has four prosperous town schools.

BOX BUTTE COUNTY 

The most of our school districts have labored under a load of 
debt for five or six years. About one-fifth of all the districts 
paid the last of their indebtedness within the past year, and an 
equal number have greatly reduced their debt, and are almost 
3ure to wipe out all indebtedness this year. As a result of this, 
we are having longer terms of school, taught by better paid 
teachers. 

One-half of the districts have either lengthened the term or 
increased the teachers' wages this year over last. 

With the burden of debt removeil and less thought of keeping 
from going deeper in debt, there comes more direct attention 
to the school and iis needs. 

The districts' desire for longer terms and their willingness to 
provide more and better apparatus for school work, and to pay 
better wages is reciprocated by the teachers. They show a 
deeper interest in their work and are anxious to take advantage 
of every means presented by which they may become more proficient 
in their work. 

We have an increased interest and attendance at our teachers' 
associational meetings; also at the monthly meetings of the 
reading circle, which meets in two divisions, one at Hemingford 
and one at Alliance. </seg>

BOYD COUNTY. 

The school work of Boyd county is in a very promising condition. 
There are seventy-seven districts in the county with a 
school population of 2676. There are three graded schools, 
Butte with three teachers, Spencer with two teachers and Lynch 
with two teachers and an assistant primary teacher. 

Our Institute, which was held in July, was well attended and 
the teachers entered their work this year overflowing with 
enthusiasm. The training they received from Mrs. Trimble, of 
North Loup, in Primary Methods was very thorough and effective. 
A. E. Davisson, of the State Agricultural College, delivered 
a lecture and a talk which was highly entertaining and 
instructive. 

We have organized a Teachers' Association to meet once a 
month, which is well attended and much interest manifested. 

Several new schoolhouses have been built the past year 
which are large, well-built and attractive in appearance. 

As a rule the school officers are interested in the school and 
are constantly demanding more thorough scholarship on the part 
of the teachers and are ready to give the teachers and pupils 
encouragements by providing helps in the way of necessary 
apparatus. A few districts where this cannot now be said of 
them, will fall into line just as soon as they are financially able. 

The patrons show great interest by attending the annual 
meetings, voting long terms and full limit of taxes. 

The State Course of Study is in the hands of every rural 
teacher and our teachers are sparing no pains in grading in 
accordance therewith. The teaching is better than would be 
expected of a new county. Our teachers are conscientious 
faithful, self-reliant, ambitious to better qualify themselves and 
willing to accept suggestions about their work, and I can con- </seg>

BURT COUNTY. 

If educational interest in Burt county for the past two years 
can be measured by material improvements, we certainly cannot 
charge any unsatisfactory educational conditions to a lack of 
general interest. Our last relic of pioneer days, an old shell of 
a schoolhouse with home-made furniture, has given place to a 
new schoolhouse built on modern plans and well furnished 
throughout. 

Tne school district of Tekamah has just completed the erection 
of a ten-room brick school building at a cost of $30,000. 
More than usual interest has been shown in rural districts by a 
willingness on the part of school boards to furnish new and more 
recent publications of text books and to brighten the interior 
walls of the schoolhouses with suitable paper and paint. 

There are 96 teachers engaged in our schools, 30 per cent of 
whom are college or normal graduates, and about 60 per cent 
are either graduates of high schools or have had equivalent 
training. 

Two county meetings of our Teachers' Association are held 
each year, and are always interesting from a social as well as a 
professional standpoint. 

Teachers' and Patrons' meetings have been held by local divisions 
of our Association, but not at regular intervals. 

The Institute last year was held at Oakland, and was of six 
days' duration. Three instructors were employed and 93 teachers 
enrolled. This year the Institute was held at Tekamah, 
August 20-25, and 100 teachers were enrolled. Examinations 
were held the Friday and Saturday preceding these Institutes, 
so that teachers would not mistake the purpose of the Institute 
for an opportunity to prepare for examination. 

The Nebraska Course of Study is used in every rural school </seg>

in the county. A copy has also been recently supplied to each 
of the rural school teachers for her private use. 

The only way to grade the rural schools and to keep them 
graded is to keep a teaching force that is thoroughly familiar 
with the Course of Study and its requirements. Recognizing 
this fact, I have earnestly urged our teachers to make the 
Teachers' Manual a constant companion in their school work; 
and I am satisfied that our teachers are better prepare'd and are 
making more uniform progress in our rural schools now than 
ever before. About 50 per cent of our teachers took the Reading 
Circle work last year; this year nearly all are studying one 
book of the Course, Roark's Method in Education. Those who 
are unable to take the work with one of the local divisions of the 
Circle will study it by themselves, and their grade in theory and 
practice next year will be the grade they receive in an examination 
based on the work in this book. 

The decision declaring the Free High School Attendance Law 
unconstitutional was a disappointment to the pupils in our rural 
schools, as many of them had already taken advantage of its 
provisions and others were planning to enter the high schools as 
soon as they could complete the eighth grade in their home 
schools. And many of them will still do so, for tuition charges 
are not unreasonable in our high schools and a determined spirit 
makes its own way. 

I shall continue to hold students' examinations and grant certificates 
to successful applicants as heretofore. These certificates 
will be honored by our county high schools and pupils holding 
them admitted without further examination. 

I believe this will encourage teachers to hold more faithfully 
to the work and pupils to remain in the schools until graduated.

is quite satisfactory to us when we take into consideration the 
fact that the real always falls short of the ideal. The educational 
spirit of Butler county has always been good. Our educational 
conventions, held annually, attest this. Our Association 
work this year is by sections, and the results are very gratifying. 
Fully 60 per cent of the teachers are doing the Reading Circle 
work outlined by the State Reading Circle Board. The High 
School Attendance Law was working admirably, and promised 
much for the pupils from the rural schools until it was declared 
void. We expect to keep the practice of graduating the pupils 
from the district schools so that we may be in line for any legislation 
that will give the country pupils what they ought to have 
a right to demand, viz: An equal chance with the pupil in the 
towns and cities. About 50 per cent of the rural schools have 
beginnings of school libraries. One district has more than one 
hundred volumes of readable books. One district contemplates 
taking advantage of the law that enables them to contract with 
neighboring districts for instruction of pupils. The law is not 
generally familiar to school officers. This office is publishing 
this year a little paper each month — The Public School — as a 
means of communication with teachers and school officers. The 
results so far convince us that it is practicable and fully worth 
the while. Gene Loomis.

The true spirit of educational progress is daily becoming manifest 
not only with the pupils attending school, but with the 
teachers and parents, and the adage "In union there is strength" 
is being happily verified, when the pupils, teachers and parents 
are working in harmony. In this county there are sixty-one 
active working districts, each with a live progressive school. 
There are 926 pupils in these schools. The teachers are earnest, 
energetic and faithful. 

We held one wetk of Institute in this county this year and it 
was characterized by deep interest and earnest work, with an 
attendance of fifty teachers, and a strong corps of instructors 
with interesting lectures. </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

On September 27 and 28 was held second session of the 
Teachers Association composed of Hitchcock, Dundy, Perkins, 
Hayes and Chase counties. Much good work was done in the 
exchange of methods, and ideas on teaching. Prof. Thomas, of 
Minden, delivered a lecture before the association. The Nebraska 
Teacher's Manual is adopted and in general use in the county, 
and meets with high favor. 

The law relative to stimulants and narcotics is almost universally 
carried out to the letter. There is a tendency on the part 
of the country schools to establish grades in harmony with the 
advanced schools. 

Our school libraries are being talked of and adopted in some 
schools, and ere long we hope for a general move in that direction. 


In conclusion I am well pleased with the progress in our 
schools and glad to note that every effort has been forward in 
advancing the spirit of education. 

Ida M. Kelly, 

County Superintendent. 

COLFAX COUNTY. 

It gives me much pleasure to say the people of Colfax county, 
are, as they always have been, much interested in their schools. I 
find in most districts a desire to cooperate with superintendent 
and teacher in anything for the welfare of the schools. 

We have in our county sixty-one districts, employing eightythree 
teachers. All of our rural schools are graded and in about 
one-half of them pupils have graduated from the eighth grade, 
and are either taking ninth grade work in the same school or are 
attending a high school or Normal. 

Examination questions have been sent out from this office four 
times a year for the purpose of keeping the schools uniform. In 
the spring just before the larger pupils leave school, for work, an 
examination is given those intending to graduate. Where convenient 
two or more schools hold this examination at the same 
place, and is given under the direction of the superintendent, 
assisted by the teachers of the schools to which the pupils belong. </seg>

STATK SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

In a few cases last year graduation exercises were held and found 
to be very valuable and an effort will be made this year to have 
graduating exercises more general, two or more schools going 
together and holding them. 

The fact that the Free High School Attendance Law was 
declared unconstitutional was a great disappointment to the 
pupils intending to graduate last year, coming as it did just about 
the time they had finished their work, but I think in most cases 
the pupils who are in earnest and get the proper encouragement 
from their teachers will graduate regardless of any law. 

Our annual Institute convened August 20th and continued in 
session two weeks. We devoted our time to the second and 
third grade branches. Academic and inspirational work were 
combined. Two classes in didactics were held, one for those 
who had taught and one for those who were about to teach for 
the first time. I think the plan a good one and will conduct the 
Institute about the same this year; no examination was held at 
the Institute whatever. 

A start has been made in about twenty districts towards school 
libraries and at the close of the present year we hope to have 
them in as many more. We usually begin by giving an entertainment 
by the pupils and in most cases the district gives as 
much as is raised by the pupils. 

We have taken up one book this year in the Teachers Reading 
Circle work, "Roark's Method in Education." The superintendent 
sends out a list of questions every month on the book and 
each teacher sends in written answers, for which credit is given 
and this record will be considered in the examination for a certificate. 


Our Teachers Association is divided into two sections, each 
division holds four meetings a y,£ar; credit is also given those 
taking an active part in the work. 

All of our teachers have had either high school or Normal 
training; in a number of cases both. In all, we believe, we have 
an excellent corps of teachers and although a number of them 
are teaching their first term, I think the patrons of the schools of </seg>

our county can feel sure the teachers, at least, are doing their 
part. Very truly yours,

County Superintendent. 

CUMING COUNTY. 

Interest in education is growing. The average number of 
months of school held in each district in the county last year was 
(718) seven and twenty-three twenty-sixths months, being an 
increase of four per cent over that of two years ago. School 
officers seem to realize the value of the services of a progressive, 
wide-awake, up-to-date teacher, and are not satisfied with anything 
but the best work. As a consequence, teachers make 
every effort to keep abreast of the times by regular attendance 
at Associations and Institutes, and by professional reading and 
stud^ 

At present the county is divided into five sections for Association 
work. One section meets at each of the four towns of the 
county, and one meets at one of the country schoolhouses. 
Each section meets monthly, and the work taken up is arranged 
to correspond with the work of the county Institute, thus 
making the Institute practically continuous throughout the year. 
In the past three years elaborate outlines and lists of questions 
have been sent to each teacher about a month before each 
Institute, for home study and preparation. In each case the 
result has been satisfaciory and has proved the wisdom of 
adopting such a plan permanently. 

The Nebraska Course of Study and Teachers's Manual is in 
the hands of every teacher in the countv and has proved to be a 
valuable guide to teachers in solving the difficult problem of 
grading country schools. While the course cannot always be 
followed closely, its use has resulted in giving to the county a 
graded system which is not inflexible, but which conduces to 
uniformity of work throughout the county. 

In many of the rural schools annual graduation exercises are 
held and the number of pupils graduated annually is constantly 
increasing. These pupils usually attend the nearest high school </seg>

and do the work in a creditable manner. We confidently look 
forward to the time when every district in the county will hold 
annual exercises of this kind. 

About one-sixth of the rural schools have established small 
libraries, and a number of other districts will doubtless make a 
beginning in that line the present year. 

During the past two years two new districts have been 
formed, making a total of seventy-eight districts. Seven new 
school buildings have been erected and equipped with the most 
modern apparatus. M. K. Manning, 

County Superintendent. 

CUSTER COUNTY 

The past two years have been very fruitful ones in the progress 
of the schools of the county in general, and the rural schools 
in particular. The interest manifested throughout the country 
districts is most gratifying and the results satisfactory. The 
average length of the school term has been materially increased 
and the wages of teachers advanced. The improved financial 
condition resulting from a vigorous effort upon the part of the 
county authorities in the collection of taxes is in a large measure 
responsible for the renewed interest. Many new buildings have 
been erected. School grounds have been improved, making the 
surroundings of the pupils pleasant and inviting. 

Within the past three years the institute enrollment has grown 
from 189 to 248. Taking into consideration the fact that 250 
teachers meet the requirements of the county, this increased 
interest in the importance of belter preparation is flattering. 
From my knowledge of the educational sentiment of the patrons 
of our schools, this progressive spirit displayed by teachers is but 
a reflection of the reawakened interest upon the part of school 
patrons. 

Two years ago the plan of holding a convention of school 
boards and patrons in connection with the institute was inaugurated. 
Its success was pronounced. All parts of the county 
were represented and the results so pleasing that it was repeated 
this year and will be continued as a regular feature of the Insti-

tute next year. It is believed that the only way to awaken that 
old time interest of a quarter of a century ago in our rural 
schools is to get in touch with one of the important factors — the 
parent. To this end the plan has been enlarged upon and local 
night meetings are being held in connection with my visits. At 
least fifty of these meetings will be held during the year. 

Many districts have during the past year established school 
libraries. This is one of the subjects emphasized in the local 
patrons meetings. School boards are urged to reduce to a minimum 
the purchase of apparatus (the kind found in the corner) 
and invest a few dollars each year in a few good books\ The 
campaign in behalf of good wholesome literature for the boys 
and girls in the country districts will be pushed vigorously during 
the year. Our county agricultural society this year awarded 
approximately $75.00 in school libraries, for exhibits at the fair 
of school work from the country districts. A lively interest was 
manifested in this exhibit. J. J. Tooley, 

County Superintendent. 

DIXON COUNTY 

For the past year the educational spirit in Dixon county has 
been very enthusiastic. The teachers are, many of them, reading 
educational works and asking where they can get others to 
aid them in their work. 

In school the teachers are doing excellent work and a large 
per cent of them are following the Nebraska Course of Study as 
a guide in their work. They have graded or partially graded 
their schools and are holding written examinations and reviews 
similar to those held in the graded schools of our cities and villages. 


Several of the schools have started libraries and are adding to 
them whenever they can. They tell me they find the library 
books very profitable reading for the pupils as many of them do 
not have much reading matter at home. Sometimes the school 
board helps pay for the library books, but generally the teacher 
and pupils give an entertainment or social and use the proceeds 
for them. </seg>


            <seg id="p258">236 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Many pupils in the country schools who had fitted themselves 
for entering a High school have felt the disappointment of not 
being able to attend, after the High School Law was declared 
unconstitutional, very keenly. Others, while feeling it just as 
keenly, have persevered and are working in order to pay 
their tuition, while others have gone to some Normal instead. 

We have had five county associations in the past year with an 
average attendance of fifty at each meeting, which we consider 
very good considering distance and other obstacles which must 
be overcome in order to attend these meetings. We are doing 
the Reading Circle Work, that is many of the teachers are, and 
they tell me they have derived good results from the same. At 
our last association we had the pleasure of having Pres. W. A. 
Clark of the State Normal with us, and we felt that he helped us 
by his kindly advice and encouraging words. He delivered an 
evening lecture while here also, which was much appreciated. 

The Teachers' Institute which was held ten days was well 
attended and we find on visiting the schools that the teachers 
gained ideas which were not vague and indefinite, but they 
gained practical ideas which they are using every day in thtir 
schoolrooms and which are very helpful to them. 

Mary McKinley, 

Comity Superintendent. 

DODGE COUNTY 

The educational spirit of Dodge county has manifested itself 
in many ways during the two years now drawing to a close. 
The patrons of the school realize more distinctly than ever before 
the great advantages of having good schools in which to give 
their children a foundation of the liberal education whicli the 
times now demand. Three new districts have been formed 
within the past year, making a total of eighty two whole and 
three fractional districts in this county. 

The schools are free from both bonded and floating indebtedness, 
with the exception of a few districts in which new school 
buildings have been erected. Many of the districts have a 
surplus of money on hand. Besides the erection of seven new </seg>


            <seg id="p259">237 

COUNTY AND CITY 8CHOOLS. 

school buildings during the past year, the people of Dodge 
county have shown their interest in the schools by maintaining 
the buildings in good repair, supplying the schools with needed 
text-books and apparatus, and doing what could be done to provide 
better means of ventilating and heating the schools. Most 
of the schoolhouses are painted white, and many of the school 
sites are enclosed with neat fences. 

There has been a marked increase, this year over former, in 
the salaries paid teachers. 

Many schools have held literary and other entertainments, to 
which a small admission fee has been charged, and with the proceeds 
of these entertainments library books and pupils' reading 
circle books have been purchased for the schools. 

Each of the five sections of the Dodge County Teachers' 
Association meets once in each of the following months: 
October, December, February and April. The teachers discuss 
the "Reading Circle" work of the year, recite general history and 
physical geography, review the late books and relate current 
events. A record of each teacher's work is kept, and credit is 
given as follows : Teachers holding "First" or "Second Grade" 
certificates who are neither tardy nor absent from these meetings' 
and whose average grade for work done at Associations 
and Institutes is over ninety per cent, shall have their certificates 
renewed at the close of our Institute without further examination. 
Those holding "Third Grade" certificates complying with 
the above named conditions shall have their standings raised ten 
per cent on branches in which they will be required to pass 
examination. 

Dodge county has 8274 children of school age. Of these, 
5877 attended school last year. All the schools are graded and 
will hold (on an average) 8.7 months of school during the year. 
A monthly report of each pupil's work is sent to the parents of 
the child for examination. Fifty-two pupils graduated from the 
country schools last year, and made application for certificates of 
attendance at some high school in the county. Great disappointment 
is felt since the "Free High School Attendance Law" 
has been declared unconstitutional. Steps have been taken, </seg>

however, to keep up the interest in the law. Teachers are 
being urged to encourage the pupils to pass the final examination 
and artistic diplomas are granted to graduates. 

The school officers have manifested interest in the Compulsory 
Attendance Law, and are not slow to notify the parents of 
children who ought to be in school. The attendance this year 
will undoubtedly be better than ever before. 

Respectfully, 

C. O. Boe,

DOUGLAS COUNTY. 

The educational spirit of Douglas county is becoming more 
and more of a professional character. Our teachers take advantage 
of professional schools and papers and by such means keep 
in the lead of educational thought. Every teacher in the county 
has at her command the Nebraska Course of Study, and the 
classes in most schools are as carefully graded as the classes are 
in the city schools. To encourage and assist in the work of 
gradation, the County Superintendt nt sends to each teacher quarterly 
examination questions which are made out according to 
the course of study. 

Eighth grade or graduating exercises are held in many of our 
schools. Examinations are given to all eighth grade scholars bv 
the county superintendent and to all who are qualified is given a 
certificate or diploma which admits them to any High school in 
the county. The past year such examinations were given to 
over one hundred eighth grade pupils. 

Nothing has been done by our State that has encouraged our 
boys and girls as much as the passage of the Free High School 
Law. And we hear no expre.-sion so often among the patrons 
of our schools as, "If we could only get a free High school law 
that would not be declared unconstitutional." 

Our county is divided into seven divisions for Reading Circle 
work. This year our teachers are reading Roark on Method in 
Education, and History of English Literature by Halleck. These </seg>

books give nearer satisfaction than any books we have used for 
several years. 

The work of supervision or supervising the country schools is, 
as now conducted, being done very poorly. A county superintendent 
at the best can only make two or three visits yearly. 
The infrequency of his visits can not do otherwise than give toolittle 
results for good. Something radically different must be 
done to give the needed help along this line, when we have so 
many new, inexperienced teachers under our care each year. At 
present, I am not prepared to say what will be the best to give 
the needed relief. 

E. J. Bod well, 

County Superintendent. 

DUNDY COUNTY 

At no period in the history of this county has the general 
interest in the schools been greater than at the present time. 
Nearly all of the schools are in session with wages advanced 
two and a half to five dollars per month, and a larger per cent of 
the districts on a cash basis. 

The county Institute this year was in session two weeks and 
was a success in every respect. The teachers turned out at the 
beginning and were present during the entire session. The use 
of the Course of Study was brought up during the Institute and 
the result is that a larger number of teachers are using it in their 
schools. Four of the districts have taken advantage of the law 
which enables them to contract with neighboring districts. This 
law is a great advantage to districts that have become partly 
depopulated during the drouths, and is a great aid to a number of 
pupils who otherwise would be without school privileges. 

A meeting of the school district officers was called in August, 
which was fairly well attended. The object of the meeting was 
to discuss various questions, pertaining to the welfare of the 
schools, among which were the following: "Duties of the 
school officers" and "County uniformity of text-books." The 
latter question consumed the greater part of the time, and the 
result was that a committee of ten, with the Superintendent as </seg>

            <seg id="p262">
240 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Chairman, was chosen to devise ways and means whereby the 
county could procure a uniformity of text-books, and at the same 
time get something for the old books. At present a number of 
the schools have a new set of good books, up-to-date in every 
respect. 

The work is more interesting for both teachers and pupils, and 
the advantages and advancement are perceptible in every school 
which made the change, and I expect to see every district in the 
county with the new books within the next year. 

Then our county uniformity will be complete, and we will also 
have the much needed change of books.

County Superintendent. 

FRANKLIN COUNTY 

Like Beelin's horse, " 'Cordin' to himself he's improvin', wonderful; 
and 'cordin' to others V reckon he's holdin' his own." 
Spirit manifests itself in attitude and activity. During the school 
year, 1898-9, there were held in Franklin county twenty-one 
Local Institutes and thirty-nine Local Teachers' meetings, with 
an attendance of 7°5 teachers, eighty-four school officers and 
1,240 patrons and pupils. During 1899-1900 there were held 
twenty-eight Local Institutes, thirty Local Teachers' meetings, 
with an attendance of 817 teachers, 107 school officers and 1,531 
patrons and pupils. An additional interest and a very appreciable 
attitude have been plainly noticeable during the first three 
months of the present year 1900-01. Among our school officers, 
90 per cent say "We wish to employ the the up-to-date, progressive 
teacher, who attends the Annual Institute and believes 
in and does the study work for the year as outlined by the 
County Superintendent and Committee." 

Our Annual Institutes have been based upon the following 
sentiments: "The County Institute should deal with the how 
of things, specifically, clearly, conclusively. True inspiration, 
based on a solid foundation, is what we need." J. W. Searson 
Wahoo, Nebraska. "A teachers's soul may burn with a divine 
inspiration, capable, as the teacher thinks, of firing her pupils </seg>

with an ambition to become mathematicians of the first magnitude. 
However, if she cannot add fractions, she will awake 
some morning and find that the pedagogic world has moved, 
and that she lies hopelessly stranded upon the shores of oblivion." 
W. L Stephens, Fairbury: "We want growth in teachers, and 
growth requires time." C. A. Fulmer, Pawnee City : "Teachers 
to be inspired must be helped. It will not do for the instructor 
to talk learnedly about something which the teacher is not prepared 
to be taught. The country teacher does not want psychology. 
She does want the results of psychological study, if 
these can be made to help her with her school problems. To 
inspire teachers in a practical way the instructor must teach the 
subjects. Not the whole, but the parts which will best illustrate 
the whole and bring to light difficulties which commonly cause 
trouble. The time is too short to teach a whole subject. It 
were better could this be done. What the teacher wants, what 
she has a right to expect, is that she will take from the Institute 
a better equipment for handling refractory boys, for interesting 
dull pupils, for organizing her school to the very best possible 
advantage, for explaining, in a way that will be understood, the 
difficulties of certain parts of arithmetic, grammar and history. 
The lecture is interesting, but interest must not be confused with 
inspiration. The first business of the Institute is serious. It will 
be a success as it grapples the hard things and sends teachers 
away with more knowledge and more real power." 

— The Nebraska Teacher, June, ipoo. 

The instructors employed in 1899 were Robt. J. Boyd, Principal, 
Bloomington, in physics, psychology, physiology and 
civics; L. B. Smutz, Principal, Riverton, in bookkeeping, geometry, 
language and grammar; O. C. Ilubbell, Superintendent, 
Fairfield, in theory and art, reading, orthography and literature; 
Miss Jennie E. Robertson, specialist, penmanship, and Superintendent 
Hussong, drawing and Nature study. The interest 
exhibited by the teacher was heartier and more keenly shown 
than in any of our preceding Institutes. The enrollment was 
not so large. </seg>


            <seg id="p264">242 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

The Institute of 1900 was planned similarly to the one of 
1899. Dr. Hans C. Peterson, University of Nebraska, Prof. 
F. T. Owen, Franklin Academy, Prin. Herbert L. Hussong, 
Hardy, Prin. T. S. Magorian, Hildreth, and Miss Jennie E. 
Robertson, were the principal instructors; Misses Margaret 
Peery, Franklin, and Alice J. Dye, Bloomington, gave some 
very excellent instruction in primary methods. Both of these 
Institutes have sent teachers away with more knowledge, more 
power and a finer enthusiasm than do the ones of old-style, 
spiritless drudgery. 

Every school in the county is nominally "graded" by the 
Nebraska Course of Study; ninety per cent are really so. 
The Teachers' Manual is used well by all our teachers — such 
use is one of the requirements of the county department of 
education — and it has in its present form been the most effective 
instrument yet devised toward securing proper grading and 
classification of the pupils in the rural schools. A very light 
interest is shown in graduation from the country schools. Six 
examinations at the most easily accessible points in the county 
were properly advertised. Nine pupils attended, of which six 
received diplomas. This, following a year's earnest attempt 
toward inspiring the pupils to graduate, was hardly a proper 
return. Twenty-three diplomas were given to eighth grade 
pupils of the village schools. 

The teachers of the county have steadily maintained a very 
effective organization of the State Reading Circle. The State 
recommendations are adopted and profitably studied. Shoup's, 
History and Science of Education and Skinner's "The Schoolmaster 
in Comedy and Satire," (112 copies of each ) were used 
last year. One book only, Roark's Method in Education is 
being studied this season. The Pupils' Reading Circle has not 
gained a permanent standing in the county; forty-one district 
libraries have been established during the past two years. 

A greater number of pupils from the country districts are 
attending our village high schools and paying tuition than did 
attend under the Free High School Law. One district only 
during the past two years has contracted with a neighboring </seg>

            <seg id="p265">

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

district for the instruction of pupils. The law in reference to 
the stimulants and narcotics is faithfully carried out, and the 
teachers are well informed as to the facts and methods of presentation. 


The countv newspapers still maintain a most helpful attitude 
toward our schools, and this makes possible much of systematic 
supervision and advisory counsel that could not be carried on 
otherwise. 

This year more than half of the country schools were supplied 
with teachers upon the direct advise of the County Superintendent, 
and while this has caused keen disappointment among 
some of the inexperienced and poorly-prepared teachers, it has 
brought about that peculiar confidence and sympathy among 
school officers, Superintendent and teachers so vitally necessary 
in public education. 

In material improvements during the past biennium, Riverton 
has extended the course of study and added an assistant principal, 
which places it in the rank of high schools. Naponee and 
Campbell have each employed a third teacher, Bloomington has 
provided for a second assistant in the High school. 

Fourteen country schoolhouses have been built new or remodeled 
to meet necessities; three new districts have been created 
and new buildings erected therein, Naponee and Campbell have 
built additional rooms to accommodate their village schools, and 
Franklin has under erection a fine, new $10,000 High school 
building to provide for a greatly increased population. 

Franklin county fully maintains her educational position 
among her sister counties and goes steadily forward in the 
general progress of Nebraska. 

In conclusion, the sentiment of the people of the county urges 
me to say, that under the official service of Hon. W. R. Jackson, 
State Superintendent, and Hon. C. F. Beck, Deputy, the State 
Department of Education has been an important factor in returning 
to us "value received" for our expenditures for public 
schools. £d M. Hussong,

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

FRONTIER COUNTY. 

Frontier county people are interested in education. Their 
interest is shown in several ways. A considerable number of 
our young people are pursuing their studies beyond the common 
course. Seldom do our colleges or normal schools lack for one 
or more students from this county, notwithstanding our distance 
from these institutions, and the varying moods of the rain-god 
who controls our financial destinies. Our public schools 
receive liberal support. Of our one hundred and nine school 
districts, sixty levy a tax of twenty-five mills, and less than onefourth 
of the districts make their levy lower than twenty mills. 
Most of the districts have good, comfortable schoolhouses, and 
about half of them are supplied with charts, maps, etc., to the 
value of $25 or more. A few schools have small libraries. 
There is a growing sentiment against the free text-book plan, 
and several districts have discarded it entirelv. 

The average length of the school year is about seven months. 
This could be materially increased without additional cost, if 
some of the sparsely settled districts would take advantage of 
the law which enables them to contract with neighboring districts. 
None have done so as vet. 

There is an increasing demand for better teachers and better 
schools, and with few exceptions our teachers are doing their 
best to become better fitted for their work. The practice of 
preparing each day's work in advance is almost universal. The 
majority of our teachers buy and read professional books, and 
the number of educational papers taken is very large. 

We had a summer school which continued six weeks, with an 
attendance of fifty. This was followed by one week of Institute, 
with an attendance of one hundred and twenty-five. The 
spirit of self-improvement manifest among our teachers was 
very gratifying. The Institute was divided into two classes, 
almost equal in number, those who had taught six months or 
more constituting the advanced division. The work was 
adapted, as far as possible, to the needs of each section, and 
the time very profitably spent. </seg>

COCNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

We have a County Association which holds two. general 
meetings each year. It is divided into fourteen sections for local 
work. The local meetings are held monthly, and the Reading 
Circle books are made, in part, the basis of the monthly programs. 
Each local circle is expected to give one public program 
during the year. This plan has not been tried until this 
year in our county, but our teachers are taking it up with commendable 
zeal, and most of the circles have very efficient 
leaders. 

The course of study is in the hands of all our teachers, and as 
a rule our schools are at least partially graded. We are using 
pupils' report cards, by means of which parents are regularly 
informed in regard to the progress of their children. We are 
planning to have graduation exercises in various parts of the 
county for those who complete the work of the eighth grade.

FURNAS COUNTY 

The past two years have seen but very little change in the 
educational status of Furnas county schools. Our people are 
now, as they have ever been, ardent supporters of the public 
school. The disadvantages that arise from a lack of funds are 
quite successfully combatted with pluck and financial sacrifice. 

It has been customary to hold county teachers' meetings at 
the several towns of the county, from time to time. Such meetings 
have usually been well attended and have proven beneficiaJ. 
The difficulty we have to contend with here is the fact that the 
towns are located in the extreme northern and southern boundaries 
of the county. This makes it difficult to get a good crowd 
out to our meetings, for railway time tables are so arranged tha 
teachers who attend must drive. 

The rural schools of this county are in better condition to-day, 
than ever before. Most of them are out of debt and well equipped. 
Being able to pay cash to teachers, has resulted in being 
able to secure better teachers for the same money. Each school 
is provided with the State Course of Study, which is followed as </seg>

rigidly as circumstances justify. The stronger districts are 
introducing small but well selected libraries. Very few have 
ever adopted the "Pupil's Reading Circle" books in the entirety. 

The repeal of the Free High School Law was a fearful blow 
to the aspirations of country pupils for a higher education. 
While the law was in force nearly one hundred certificates were 
issued by this office to rural pupils, enabling them to attend some 
one of the five high schools in this county. At present, not over 
one-third of those who were benefited by this law are attending 
the high school. Only one school district in the county pays 
tuition to another district for high school privileges, and that only 
for two pupils. It is next to impossible to get districts to enter 
into a contract with another district for payment of high school 
tuition. 

In order to equalize and better the condition of all of the 
schools in general, the laws of the State should be so changed, 
that taxes derived from railway companies should be divided 
pro-rata among all the districts of the county, according to 
school population. Under the present system, all the districts 
of a county support the railroads, and a few of them enjoy the 
support of railroad taxes. Hence it is, that the districts along 
the railroads have light taxes and long terms of school, while 
those away from the railroad have either to pay a high tax or 
have a short term of school. Respectfully submitted, 

A. O. Hinson, 

County Superintendent . 

GAGE COUNTY. 

Gage county schools are in excellent condition, both with regard 
o finances and quality of work done. There are 157 school 
districts in the county employing, excluding the city of Beatrice, 
195 teachers. 

Ihe State Course of Study is now in the hands of every 
teacher, and the schools are all being graded as closely as possible. 
Test questions and report cards are used to aid in unifying 
the work throughout the county. Diplomas are given to all 
students of the eighth grade that pass a satisfactory examination. </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

Last year seventy-four students from the country schools entered 
the different high schools of the county. The passage of a Free 
High School Attendance Law would increase the attendance in 
high schools. Two years ago one hundred thirty-nine pupils 
from rural schools entered the various high schools of the 
county. 

Our teachers are alive to the importance of the Teachers' 
Reading Circle; nearly 85 per cent, of the teachers are enrolled 
as members. 

• We have the county divided into seven local circles, and 
reports come to this office that good interest is being taken by 
all the teachers. At present we have fifty-six school libraries in 
the schools of the county, and during the coming year we expect 
to see many new ones added to the list. Thus far but one school 
has taken advantage of the law providing for the instruction of 
their pupils in a neighboring district. The result has been satisfactory, 
and has reduced the expense to the district. One very 
necessary change in our school law is that the Couty Superintendent 
of the larger counties be furnished a deputy. 

A. R. Staller, 

County Superintendent. 

GOSPER COUNTY 

The educational outlook in Gosper county is in a very promising 
condition. There are sixty-four schools in the county, one 
high school at Elwood, and one graded school of two rooms at 
Smithfield^ The course of study is in the hands of every 
teacher with a view to bringing the work in the country schools 
on a more systematic basis of gradation. The greatest difficulty 
that the teachers have in using the course of study is in the use 
of text-books not made for the course. We will gradually overcome 
this difficulty by the introduction of new books in the 
place of the old ones. A system of quarterly review tests are 
sent to the teachers and the "Course of Study" is a principal 
feature of our Reading Circle discussions. 

We have four sectional meetings which are auxiliary to the 
County Association — 80 per cent of the teachers are doing the </seg>

Reading Circle work. Township graduation exercises will be 
held at the close of the spring terms and quite a number of 
pupils will finish the eighth grade. 

Much enthusiasm has been lost along this line since the Free 
High School Attendance Law was declared unconstitutional, but 
the teachers are instructed to encourage and enthuse the pupils 
on the subject of completing the common school course. We 
have one school library in the county, but we feel that this is but 
a beginning. We hope that before another year we may have

HALL COUNTY. 

In attempting, through a brief summary, to touch upon some 
of the most vital points concerning the principal part of school 
education in Hall county, it might be wise to say by way of 
introduction that I will not enter into the details of any subject. 
My term as County Superintendent began January 4, 1900, and 
while I knew pretty well the situation of school affairs previous 
to that, I shall not go beyond that date. In general, the educational 
spirit of the county is good. It will average with that of 
other counties having no more of an educational center than that 
in which we are located. Our Institute instructors for the past 
five years have been among the strongest in the State. They, 
in conjunction with our most able local instructors and teachers, 
have continually kept pointing with pride to the eastern part of 
our State, and have never failed to show what the strongest 
educational counties were doing. This has kept us trying to 
develop as rapidly as our neighbors, and has consequently given 
our "Educational Spirit" a healthy atmosphere. In general, the 
teacher, parent and pupil work in harmony with the best results 
in view. Hall county is well organized in regard to its Teachers' 
Association. This year the entire county is to meet three times 
in Association Meeting. These for several years have been 
quite well attended. In addition to this work, our county is 
divided off into six local divisions, which does so much work 
each month. Some of these meet monthly, and others semi- </seg>

            <seg id="p271">
249 

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

monthly. We have taken up two books for our work, and each 
month's work has been outlined. Three-fourths of all the 
teachers are doing this work. As a special inducement, I have 
made arrangements to exempt those who did good work in 
grades last August from such a trial next year, if they do the 
local R. C. work. Those who do not attend will be expected to 
be examined a second time. As to Institutes, our corps of 
instructors last year was Supt. J. W. Searson and Miss C. M. 
Burgert, with two additional assistants. Three-fourths of the 
teachers specially needed primary work, and as a result of our 
efforts in that particular, three-fourths of the teachers expressed 
themselves as being willing to say they never before got so much 
good from the Institute. 

I have insisted upon our following, as nearly as possible, the 
State Course. Each teacher has a course of study on the desk, 
and I find when visiting that its wear shows its use. In the 
same line, we give examinations and issue report cards, that we 
may follow closer. As to the grading of our schools, I might 
say that matter has only been in a semi state. The matter has 
not been urged as it will be in the coming j ear. 

There never yet has been graduation in the rural schools, but 
I expect to inquire as to how many will take part in the final 
examinations by the Supt., and if possible, we will hold graduation 
exercises. 

Our libraries and large dictionaries are the things most needed 
in forty-three of the schools; in fact, otherwise the schools are all 
well supplied. 

If there ever was a good school law passed, the same was 
embodied in the Free High School Law. Many of our pupils 
were taking advantage of it, and many more were making 
efforts to complete the rural course and enter the high school. 
We have made no attempt to keep up the law, as many would 
not agree to allow the same. We do not have a district that 
takes advantage of the "Contract with Neighboring Districts." 

Needed legislation : In my opinion, some one person directly 
under the State Superintendent, ought to look after enforcing 
the "Compulsory Attendance Law." Director # does not feel </seg>

inclined to do it. Railroad tax should be divided among all 
districts, pro rata with district valuation. School levy on railway 
property should be an average of all mills voted. 

Dan H. Fishburn, 

County Superintendent. 

HAMILTON COUNTY 

After nearly three years supervision of the schools of Hamilton 
County, 1 am at a loss to know just how much progress 
h^s been made. Certainly there is a great deal of room for 
improvement, both in the efficiency of the teachers and in the 
interest taken in school matters by parents and teachers. 

We still have a few persons who are willing to give their 
time for twenty-five dollars per month, and who usually give 
only their time to the district which hires them, but on the whole 
wages have advanced materially; and with the advance in wages 
has also come a rise in the standard of teachers. But we still 
too often find a person holding a good certificate who will never 
make a teacher. 

We find the parents visiting our schools more often than they 
did three years ago, but there are too many who are yet content 
to hire a teacher, and then carry out the old proverbial saying: 
"What's everybody's business is nobody's business," and I'll let 
the teacher entirely alone. But the most promising feature is 
the fact that school boards are taking a more live interest in 
school affairs, and are demanding better teachers. We no longer 
find directors whose first question is: "What will you teach for?" 
but now they are asking what grade certificate do you hold and 
what are your qualifications. 

Parents are also taking great interest in the Free High School 
Attendance Law, and were greatly disappointed when it was 
declared unconstitutional. In fact, when the law first went into 
effect there were so many applicants for admission to the Aurora 
High school that a great many were turned away. No less 
than fifty pupils from rural districts passed the examination and 
were given certificates of admission within two months. Pupils </seg>

as well as parents are looking forward to an act of the Legislature 
making such free instruction in high schools possible. 

Great interest has been shown in the establishment of libraries 
in the district schools, and within the last three years more than 
two-thirds of the schools have bought libraries varying in size 
from 60 to 300 volumes. But aside from the interest in reading 
among the pupils which the libraries assure, nothing has been 
done to interest the pupils in literature, and we appreciate the 
fact that too little good literature is brought to their attention. 
While our teachers are not enthusiastic enough in their Reading 
Circle work, yet we can congratulate ourselves that there has 
been some improvement and there seems to be a decided inclination 
to better work in that line this year. 

Respectfully yours, 

Tim F. McCarthy, 

County Superintendent. 

HOWARD COUNTY 

In this county the educational work the past year has been 
very satisfactory. 

Our quarterly County Associations have been well attended, 
and questions pertinent to school management have been thoroughly 
discussed with much spirit. A great amount of good 
has resulted from these meetings. 

Our last Institute was larger than for several years, a full 
attendance being required. A credit of 5 per cent being 
added to the general average of those who were neither absent 
nor tardy, brought out good results. I am pleased to report 
that more teachers are doing the Reading Circle work than 
ever before. The local meetings are well attended and much 
enthusiasm is being expressed for the work. 

We have adopted the plan of excusing from examination 
teachers with an average grade of 80 per cent if they do the 
L. R. C. work. Those who do not take the work are required 
to pass a full examination regardles of grades. 

One of the difficult problems that confront me is the new 
teacher. Every year from one-quarter to one-third of the </seg>

teachers drop out aud new material has to be provided. A good 
many of the applicants have had no previous training. We 
have endeavored to keep the standard of our teachers as high as 
possible and, so far, have only issued enough certificates to 
supply the schools. 

We are trying to impress upon the new teacher the necessity 
of professional training, and are succeeding in a moderate 
degree. 

C. B. Manuel, 

County Superintendent. 

JEFFERSON COUNTY. 

The ioo school districts into which Jefferson county is divided 
employ 126 teachers. The educational spirit of this corps of 
teachers is most commendable. Of the 108 under my direct 
supervision, not more than three are doing nothing in the way of 
better preparation for teaching, and more than 90 per cent are 
doing the regular reading and written work outlined by the 
County Association. No person is deemed qualified to teach 
who has not attained the age of eighteen years, and the teachers, 
by a large vote, endorsed a proposition to increase the required 
average 1 per cent each year, until those who were unwilling to 
progress should be forced out of the profession. 

Of the whole number of teachers employed in the county 26 
are males and 100 females. The average age is 23, and 17 are 
teaching their first year, 12 their second, and 97 have taught two 
years or more, 15 of this number having taught ten years or 
more. Eight are graduates of some college or university, 16 
are graduates of a Normal school, 60 have a High school education 
or its equivalent, 36 have had less than three years' High 
school (most of these are graduates of village schools having 10 
grades), and 6 have had no High school, or equivalent, training. 
The Teachers' Library Association owns a library of about 1 100 
volumes, situated in the Superintendent's office, and accessible to 
teachers who are members of the Association. 

This library has done very much for the schools, as well as </seg>

the tf achers, in the way of stimulating a desire for good reading 
matter and teaching wholesome moral lessons. 

The Nebraska Course of Study is followed as closely as is 
practicable in all of the schools of the county, and every effort is 
made to keep the work uniform throughout. Pupils are promoted 
regularly upon completion of the work in any grade, and 
are given a public graduation, and awarded a county diploma 
upon completion of the common school course. The school officers 
of our county are generally liberal and enterprising.' The 
schoolrooms are kept in respectable repair, text books and supplies 
are liberally furnished, and school libraries and reference 
books are found in many of the districts. 

A six weeks' summer school held in the county last summer 
was well attended and productive of much good. The Institute 
is held annually for one week, and is designed as an inspirational 
gathering. We hope for a return of the Free High School 
Attendance Law, county uniformity of school taxation, and 
many other reforms that would be helpful to our school system.

County Superintendent. 

JOHNSON COUNTY. 

It is a pleasure to report on the educational affairs of Johnson 
county. 

There has never been a time when there was a better educa 
tional spirit than at present. 

The people are giving more attention to school matters, and 
are willing to provide everything needed, that the best work 
possible may be done. 

Financially speaking, the various districts are also in splendid 
condition — but five of the seventy-eight having any bonded 
indebtedness. 

Several new schoolhouses have been built, usually well finished 
and furnished with the best of furniture. 

Elk Creek is now putting up a splendid four-room building 
for her increasing school population. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT S REPORT. 

The demand for better teachers is increasing, as is also the 
disposition to pay better wages. 

The teachers are meeting this demand for better work, with 
its better pay, by making special preparation, many taking extra 
training at our Normal schools. Many of our teachers are 
Normal graduates, while many others who are not graduates, 
have had one or two years' Normal training. 

An earnest effort has been made to grade and classify the 
schools of the county, and the result has been quite satisfactory. 

The teachers, with scarcely an exception, are following the 
State Course of Study as closely as local conditions will permit. 
Test questions are sent each quarter to all the schools, — this I 
find of much value in enforcing a better classification of the 
pupils. 

Many pupils complete the course of study as outlined for 
country schools, are graduated, and receive a diploma from the 
County Superintendent. 

Most of these pupils enter some one of our high schools. 

One of my chief objects during the past two years has been 
to effect a better condition of grading and classifying the schools, 
and in this work I am pleased to say that I have had the loyal 
support of both teachers and patrons; and while much remains 
to be done, yet we are thankful that much progress has been 
made. 

Our Teachers' Associations are well attended, — the interest 
shown by the teachers in their professional advancement deserves 
much praise. 

Our last Teachers' Institute was one of the largest in point of 
attendance ever held in the county. 

The work done was mostly professional, and of a high grade. 

It has been my earnest desire to make the Institute worth 
attending, hence I have selected instructors on account of their 
special qualifications for such work. 

It seems to me that if our schools do no more than give our 
children a desire to read good literature, together with the ability 
to understand and appreciate the same, then they will have 
accomplished at least half their mission. </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

With this object in view I have urged the establishment of 
school libraries, and many schools now have small libraries, 
and these libraries are increasing both in number and size. 

Books of the best class only are being purchased, and the 
results obtained from their use are quite satisfactory. 

The Free High School Attendance Law was giving general 
satisfaction, many pupils taking advantage of its liberal provistions. 
We regret that it was declared unconstitutional. 

Teachers are following out the requirements of the law with 
reference to teaching the effects of narcotics on the human system. 


The prospects for the future are quite bright, and I am sure 
that with the same energy, ability and devotion to their calling 
on the part of the teachers in the future, as they have shown in 
the past, that constant progress will be made.

KIMBALL COUNTY. 

Kimball county covers a little piece of arid land in the extreme 
western part of Nebraska, 35 ]/^ by 27^ miles, containing 15 
school buildings, 200 children of school age, 1 1 1 families, or one 
family to every eight square miles. Owing to the light rainfall 
no crops to speak of are grown, except along the Lodge Pole 
creek, where water can be run out upon the land. The people 
are engaged principally in stock raising, and, of course, in such 
a country we find the "wild and woolly" cowboy of the plains. 

But for we who come in daily contact with the above, that 
name has no terror. For he is usually educated and from good 
homes, and has a big heart. We find him in the schoolroom, 
country houses and banking institutions, as well as on|the plains, 
and I believe there is no class of people more liberal, more philo^ 
sophic, more interested, in the education of their children than the 
so-called "cowboy" of Western Nebraska. I find that the teachers 
rank well by comparison with teachers of other counties with 
whom I have come in contact in Teachers' Institutes and "other

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Their spirit of enthusiasm and earnestness is well indicated by 
the fact that while it takes but seventeen teachers to fill our 
schools, the enrollment at our annual Institute was twenty-three, 
with an average daily attendance of twenty-one for the entire 
session of two weeks. In addition to this every teacher in the 
county takes an educational paper. Our library is doing good 
work. While it is not strictly a teachers' collection, yet there 
is no literature but of the best. We have forty-nine members, and 
the earnestness shown by the teachers, as well as the patrons, 
in its future as well as present existence, is very encouraging. 
The number of books taken out and read speaks well for the 
community, and its influence for good cannot be estimated. 

Since the beginning of the school year we have had only one 
association, divided into two sessions, afternoon and evening, 
both well attended. 

The numbers were interesting and instructive from start to 
finish. Papers exceptionally good. Our teachers deserve special 
commendation upon their work. 

We are following the State Course of Study, and adopted uniform 
system of text books, and because of this the children in 
our country schools are able to take up the work in the Kimbail 
school without any inconvenience. 

There is not a third grade certificate issued in the county, and 
the number of first grades are increasing. 

In the County Superintendent's office you will find work sent 
in by the different pupils in the county. This work is for the 
inspection of all who may be interested. I think this encourages 
the pupils and broadens the teachers' field of activity. 

Our work in the Kimbail schools takes up all the branches 
required for a first grade certificate, and in addition zoology and 
rhetoric. Seventy-five dollars have been expended for supplies 
in laboratory this year, and the children have access to quite an 
extensive library. 

I find among school officers and patrons a general and very 
encouraging interest in school matters. Yours truly,

COUNTY AND CITY 8CHOOLS. 

KEITH COUNTY. 

A number of our teachers are attending schools in the eastern 
part of the State. This has caused a scarcity of teachers in 
this county this year. Their places have been filled, partially, 
by inexperienced teachers and partially by teachers outside the 
county. 

Owing to portions of the county being very sparsely settled, 
several of the districts containing only one family, they are 
taking advantage of the Contract Provision and are transporting 
to neighboring districts. This gives them longer and better 
school privileges and is giving very satisfactory results. 

Many people who live on ranches, or are otherwise unfavorably 
situated for school advantages, move to Ogalalla to avail 
themselves of school privileges during the fall and winter. 

It would be an advantage to a number of the districts of 
this county if the law governing the six-mile limit was changed 
so that they could take in more territory, thereby increasing 
their valuation. 

I have been making a special effort along the line of grading 
or, at least, systematizing the work. We are using the Monthly 
Report Cards and Quarterly Review Questions. So far as I 
have observed, the work is oncouraging. 

Wesley Tressler, 

County Superintendent. 

KEARNEY COUNTY 

Considering it as a whole, Kearney county, is in a fairly prosperous 
condition. But we are sorry to report that there are conditions 
that exist which are not what we might wish, and which 
we hope in time may be rectified. 

Our County Teachers' Association which meets four times 
each year, is thoroughly organized. An unusual amount of 
interest and enthusiam was displayed at our last meeting, which 
was the first one of this school year. 

The County Board has been liberal in the Institute appropriation, 
and we have therefore been enabled to secure com- 

18 </seg>

            <seg id="p280">
STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT.

petent, up-to-date instructors, thereby placing before our 
teachers the best and most improved methods. 

Nearly all our school buildings are in excellent condition, and 
our schools upon the average are well equipped with the best 
modern apparatus. We feel that the standard of our schools is 
being markedly raised, yet we greatly realize the lack of professionally 
trained teachers in our county. 

No certificate has been granted the past year only upon the 
applicant's passing a thorough examination upon all branches 
included in a second-grade certificate. In order that the supply 
of teachers might equal the demand, it has been necessary to 
issue a number of third-grade certificates to applicants who 
failed to average 80%, the required standard, but who obtained 
an average of 70% on the second grade branches. As soon as 
practicable, no license will fall below an average of 80% . 

Realizing the importance of well classified schools, we have 
emphasized the necessity of a constant use of the Nebraska 
Course of Study and Teachers' Manual, but finding it inadequate 
to the needs of our schools, we have secured the Illinois 
Course of Study, and will place a copy in the hands of each 
teacher at once. 

We have arranged to issue certificates of attainment to those 
pupils who complete the eighth grade in our country schools, 
and this will admit them to our high schools. We believe this 
will be an incentive to a higher education. 

A goodly number of schools have established adequate 
libraries, and patrons as well as students are filled with inspiration 
in this work. 

We believe that a more practical and complete course of study 
for Nebraska, and a Constitutional Free High School Attendance 
Law is essential to the welfare of not only this county, but 
to every county in the State. 

Teachers' wages have raised perceptibly this school year, and 
we are in hopes that as the standard of qualification rises that 
each teacher may receive the remuneration which she deservedly 
earns. There is a growing tendency upon the part of school 
officers to consult with the County Superintendent with regard </seg>

            <seg id="p281">

to the teachers who are best adapted to fit the needs of their 
schools. We feel that this is an important step in advancement, 
as by this means the Superintendent may urge the employment 
of teachers whom, through observation, he deems successful in 
methods of teaching, scholastic ability and endowed with the 
necessary amount of tact. 

We are enthusiastically preparing for perceptible changes for 
the better in the future. J. R. Baker, 

County Superintendent. 

LANCASTER COUNTY. 

The educational spirit in Lancaster county was never better 
than at the present time. With an efficient corps of teachers, 
many of whom have had professional training, whose interest in 
professional reading and Teachers' Association work is more 
clearly manifest each year, and who enthusiastically cooperate 
with the County Superintendent in carrying out the general plan 
of work, the public schools of Lancaster county have been 
greatly improved. 

During my incumbency in the office of County Superintendent, 
local and central Teachers' associations have been maintained. 
Last year our teachers did Reading Circle work, the 
subject matter of the texts read being discussed at local associations. 
At the central associations held in Lincoln during the 
year, the morning sessions were devoted to the discussion of live 
school topics by the teachers of the county. The afternoon session 
was what the Association is pleased to term a general session. 
The main features of the afternoon programs were the addresses 
by prominent educators of the State upon topics of vital importance 
to the profession. This year the executive committee of 
the Association decided that, in lieu of continuing the local associations, 
more central meetings be held and the locals be discontinued. 
The time at the morning meeting is occupied with the 
discussion of the texts of Reading Circle books. The afternoons, 
as heretofore, are devoted to lectures and addresses 
by the best talent attainable. 

A two weeks' Teachers' Institute is held each year during the </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

month of June. It has been our purpose to make the annual 
Institute, in the main, a school of methods, and not a school of 
instruction in the subject matter of the branches taught in the 
public schools. Being in the midst of colleges and universities, 
it would seem unnecessary to make the Institute other than a 
school of methods. In planning the work of the Institute, it has 
been thought best to have a few subjects presented by specialists 
each year, instead of introducing every subject in the curriculum. 
Only well-known specialists are engaged to work in our Institutes. 
Usually more than 300 teachers enroll for work. 

Every teacher in the county has a copy of the Nebraska Course 
of Study and Manual upon her desk, and all are endeavoring to 
classify and grade their schools in accordance with the course. 
Quarterly examination questions, based upon the State Course, 
are sent out from the County Superintendent's office during the 
year. Teachers are adhering to the course only in so far as the 
conditions seem to warrant them in doing so. A number of the 
teachers use the Illinois Course in connection with the Nebraska 
Course. 

No scheme ever attempted in this county has done more to 
stimulate pupils to earnestness of effort than that of having 
county examinations. Since the law providing for free attendance 
at high schools has been repealed, or declared unconstitutional, 
we have continued to issue high school certificates and county

Almost two-thirds of the schools of Lancaster county have 
well selected libraries of from forty to two hundred and fifty 
volumes. Other schools are making an effort to raise funds for 
libraries. 

Teachers' Reading Circle work has been kept up each year, 
and much interest manifested in the course. 

Steps are being taken by local educators to work for the introduction 
of a new Free Attendance High School Law at the next

tics of the State, and our teaching force may be depended upon 
to labor for the passage of such an act by the Legislature.

County Superintendent. 

LINCOLN COUNTY 

Comparing present educational conditions in this county with 
those existing at time of last report, a steady advance is 
apparent. 

North Platte, the county seat, has just replaced the high 
school building erected in 1873 with a commodious and sanitary 
modern structure. Sutherland took the lead in this respect two 
years ago. Several rural districts have substituted frame for 
sod houses. 

I am glad to be able to report an increase of $3.15 in the 
average monthly salary of male teachers, and $2.41 in that of 
female teachers. The census enumeration has increased 316. 

A live interest is manifest in the village and rural schools 
generally. Brady and Sutherland have each added a year to 
the course of study, the latter employing an additional teacher. 
Hershey has taken a progressive step in combining two schools 
into a two-department school. By judicious management in 
contracting with a neighboring district, the Wallace Board has 
been able to provide excellent instruction for its pupils. The 
enrollment at Wellfleet has increased so materially that an extra 
teacher is needed. 

No provision having yet been made for the establishment of 
an accessible State Normal School in Western Nebraska, a six 
weeks' Summer School for teachers and prospective teachers 
has been held each year immediately preceding the Institute, 
the enrollment being respectively thirty, seventy and ninety 
students. It is hoped that the city schools here will soon offer 
to those graduates, intending to teach, some special professional 
training. 

The free transportation law has not proven adaptable, but the 
provision for contracting with neighboring districts for the 
instruction of all pupils is being favorably considered. At </seg>

present, four districts are trying the plan and, thus far, results 
have been satisfactory and mutually advantageous. 

Frequent change of teachers continue. Of the 117 comprising 
the active teaching force in the village and rural 
schools in January, 1898, but thirty-six are now teaching, while 
but two have have remained in the same positions during the 
entire time. 

A fair test of the local division plan of Reading Circle study 
has proven it a failure in all except thickly settled localities. In 
sparsely settled localities teachers are urged to read in groups. 
All educational meetings held in the spring and summer are 
well attended. Supply and demand of teachers are about equal 
this year. Bertha Thoelecke, 

Cottnty Superintendent. 

NUCKOLLS COUNTY. 

In reporting to you the general condition of schools of 
Nuckolls county I am glad to say : 

1. That they are gradually falling into lines of better work 
and progress. 

2. That school officers seem to be more interested and united 
in the discharge of their duties. 

3. That teachers are studying their work more from a professional 
standpoint than ever before. 

While these conditions are uplifting and encouraging, yet 
there is room for improvement in many respects. Our rural 
schools have been backward in following the State Course of 
Study in the past, and no special effort has been made to introduce, 
enforce and complete it until this year. All teachers have 
been supplied with State Course, and have been instructed to follow 
it as closely as conditions will admit. 

While schools are moving steadily onward, yet there are too 
many weaknesses in our school law to allow the advancement 
that should be made, and by your permission the following weak 
points are noted : 

1. The County Superintendent has no authority to cause </seg>

            <seg id="p285">
263 

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

school boards to meet him in counsel on school questions. Their 
action is entirely voluntary, while his is made specific by law. 

2. The drafting and adopting of a course of study is left 
entirely with the several school boards, which, if done at all as 
the law directs, would give rise to a variety of courses, instead 
of the much needed uniformity. This condition almost excludes 
anything like authority and system in school management. 

3. In our opinion, Superintendents need assistance in teachers' 
examinations, not only to do away with the "one-man-power" 
in granting certificates, but to relieve them of so much office 
work, when their time is needed so badly in visiting schools, 
counseling with school officers, etc. 

While there are other points that could be strengthened, yet 
these I deem of most importance to the Superintendent's work, 
and hoping that such weaknesses may be remedied by the 
coming Legislature, I am as ever your obedient servant, 

W. T. BOTTENFIELD, 

County Superintendent. 

OTOE COUNTY. 

The educational conditions of Otoe county are favorable to 
healthy growth and development. We have a lively, energetic 
body of teachers, ever on the alert to improve and progress. 
The standard has been materially raised the past years, and we 
hope to raise it more the ensuing year. We have found out 
long ago that the true criterion of a teachers' ability is not her 
standing on the certificate, but hkr actual work in the 
schoolroom. This fact is always taken into consideration when 
the required standing is raised. 

We have a well organized County Teachers' Association, 
which meets six times during the school year in different parts 
of the county, thereby giving a local interest in educational 
work that could not be obtained were the meetings held in the 
same place. Nearly all the teachers in the county are enthusiastic 
members and great good is derived from our meetings, 
which are always well attended. During the school year — 
1900-1901, each of the six meetings is to be preceded with an </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

address by an able lecturer. The majority of the district school 
teachers are in the State Teachers' Reading Circle, and the professional 
work of the same is made the basis of the year's Association 
work. The success of the meetings held so far this year 
show the wisdom of combining the Association work and the 
professional work of the Nebraska Teachers' Reading Circle. 
Our County Teachers' Institute becomes more interesting every 
year. The instructors have been educators in whose energy, 
ability, and skill there was no doubt. The attendance at the 
last Institute, the 26th annual session, held at Nebraska City, 
was the largest in the history of the county. Good work has 
been done in our country schools in the way of establishing 
libraries. Quite a number of districts have put in libraries since 
the first of the year, and other districts have added to their 
libraries begun before this year. 

The Nebraska Course of Study and Teachers' Manual is used 
by all the teachers of the rural schools, and followed as closely as 
the respective schools will fit the course. There is a steady 
advancement in the line of gradation of the rural schools of the 
county. As this progress is made, the necessity of a thorough 
revision of the State Course becomes more and more apparent. 
Review questions on the work outlined in the course of study 
are sent out and used quarterly. They have been found helpful 
in systematic work. One hundred eighty (180) pupils took the 
final eighth grade examination during the past two years. The 
County Superintendent graded the papers of these and issued 
diplomas to one hundred twenty-nine successful ones. 

C. G. Ellwanger, 

County Superintendent. 

PERKINS COUNTY 

Our greatest drawback this year is the loss of very nearly all 
our male teachers, and a large percentage of the experienced 
female teachers. The men have found stockraising more profitable 
than teaching, and an unusually large number of our lady 
teachers have passed on via matrimony; so that just about onethird 
of our teachers this year are beginners, who have had no </seg>


            <seg id="p287">265

experience whatever in the work. If these young people had 
only had a term or two in a good Normal school, this would be 
almost a blessing ; because they are not in ruts, do not think they 
know it all, and are clear full of ambition, energy, and enthusiasm. 

Only two of all these beginners have ever seen a Normal 
school, and while the blind flounderings of some of them would 
make fools laugh and angels weep, their intense application and 
heroic efforts, uncomplainingly rendered, constitute a silent but 
most pathetic cry of "Give us a chance." 

The special aim of our school work this year is to bring our 
schools up to the standard in the phonic elements in reading and 
spelling. This work was very ably presented in the Institute 
and many of the teachers are making a decided success of it by 
using the Johnny Story and Pollard Speller for daily blackboard 
lessons in word-marking and sound-spelling. 

Twelve districts of this county took advantage of the law permitting 
schooling in a neighboring district last year, and a still 
greater number have made provision to do that this year. 
Besides this, a number of districts have alternate terms with the 
same teacher and schools in both districts, so that we, no doubt, 
have at least twenty combination schools in the county; and 
these are invariably the best schools for many reasons, among 
which are the following: They hire the best teachers; have 
longer terms; more scholars; more competition; more enthusiam; 
better supplies; and, in fact, seem better in every way, 
and much less likely to settle down into a lifeless, drifting condition. 
As a result of this system, many of the scholars ride or 
drive to school, and it is not at all uncommon to find a stable on 
the school grounds, and in school time the various vehicles of 
every descripiion scattered over the surrounding prairie makes 
it look like a miniature camp-meeting is in progress, whereas, 
it is only the inhabitants of a cattle country solving their own 
problems in their own way. A. Softlky, 

County Superintendent. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

PHELPS COUNTY. 

The educational spirit of the county is good. Wide-awake 
teachers and a public always interested in educational work 
make it so. We find in our people in this county a ready 
response and sympathy for all our work that is for the upbuilding 
of our schools. 

Our teachers are, as a rule, much interested in their work as 
a profession, and are working steadily to improve and better fit 
themselves for teaching. 

We meet three times a year in our County Association to learn 
and discuss better methods, and in addition to this we have seven 
organizations for Reading Circle work. In these the regular 
Reading Circle Course is followed, and teachers meet twice a 
month to review and discuss the work. Some of the Circles 
meet oftener than twice a month and some of them meet once a 
week. 

At the end of the work there will be a written review, conducted 
by the County Superintendent, and all teachers who are 
able to pass a good grade in the Reading Circle will be given 
the privilege of renewal of certificate without examination. This 
plan was adopted last year and works well. It recognizes effort 
on the part of the teacher for self-improvement, and stimulates a 
healthy professional study. 

Our rural schools are graded as near as conditions will allow. 
Our Nebraska Course is followed in all our schools to some 
extent, but is used mostly in our rural schools. 

The unconstitutionality of our High School Law has been a 
disappointment to us, but we are trying to do the best we can to 
keep up a public spirit and interest in our young people. For 
this year we have adopted a somewhat different plan than what 
we had in former years. Our teachers are preparing an educational 
exhibit, which is a county affair, and will be one of the 
interesting features of our next County Institute. The last day 
of the Institute will be known as "Patron's Day," when the 
public will be invited in to enjoy the exhibit with us. In the 
evening all graduates of our rural schools will appear and receive 
their diplomas. It is believed that this will more closely unite

the educational interests of the county, and that it will result in 
good to our schools. 

The law for contracting with a nearer school has been tried in 
this county, and with good results. It always helps the small 
district, as it gives a longer term of school, and it often does so 
for less money than a short term will cost in the home district. 
We have not laid much stress on the matter of pupils' libraries 
this year, largely owing to crop failure in this county. We'have 
a good start in this direction, having in our rural schools over 
fifteen hundred volumes, placed there in former years. We are 
impressed with the idea of traveling libraries, and would like to 
give the matter a trial.

PLATTE COUNTY 

There has been considerable progress made in the general 
condition of the schools of Platte county since our last biennial 
report. Districts that were heavily in debt a few years ago are 
now nearly or quite free from the same, while many districts 
have a surplus in their treasury. 

There has been perceptible improvement in the scholarship of 
our teachers, while the advancement in correct methods of teaching 
has been marked. The excellent graded schools in Columbus, 
Humphrey, Platte Center, Creston, Lindsay and Monroe, 
each of them are turning out graduates which provide us with 
first-class teachers at home. 

The efficiency of our school officers with much pleasure is 
hereby acknowledged. As a rule they have been well chosen. 
Our new schoolhouses, up to date books, slate blackboards, maps, 
desks, and other school paraphernalia introduced, besides longer 
terms, and higher wages paid, are evidences that school officers 
are looking after the welfare of our schools. 

The Annual Institute and County Association meetings are 
well attended. We are encouraged by the people of the county, 
who are always ready and willing to assist in anything that has 
a tendency to promote the cause of education. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT.

The State Course of Study is followed by all of our rural 
schools. Questions based on this course are sent to the teachers 
to be given to the pupils bimonthly. Judging from the interest 
taken we are hopeful of results. 

Twenty-six students were graduated from the rural schools 
while the High School law was in effect. Anticipating that a 
new law will be framed that will prove valid, we expect to continue 
this encouraging work. The Transfer law which directly 
affects the education of 142 children in the county, is certainly a 
wise provision. 

The Teachers' Reading Circle have adopted the course recommended 
by the State Reading Circle Board. The enrollment 
includes four-fifths of all the teachers in the county. 

The pupils' reading is carefully provided for. In towns large 
libraries are maintained by the schools for the students' use. In 
rural schools the reading is limited to an occasional library, text 
books, home, and supplementary work. 

In conclusion, we think we are justified in saying, considering 
the amount of supervision required, that our progress, while not 
all we have desired, yet it is in the right direction, and is a source 
of encouragement to all who are interested in the great cause.

County Superintendent. 

POLK COUNTY. 

When I entered upon the duties of this office in January, 
1898, one-half of the teachers in the rural schools of this county 
were beginners, many receiving only $20 per month. 

I soon became convinced that something must be done to 
change this condition or our schools would retrograde rather 
than advance. My first duty was to acquaint our people with 
these lamentable facts; and since then I have attempted to 
improve every opportunity to convince patrons and school 
boards that if we desire to retain our experienced, progressive 
and successful teachers, it will be absolutely necessary 
to pay higher wages. A happy revival has taken place and 
now less than 20 per cent of our teachers are teaching their </seg>

first term, while 33 per cent hold either first grade or professional 
certificates, and many of them are doing excellent work. 

The amended Compulsory Attendance Law has had the 
favorable effect that during the last school year 93 per cent of 
the children between the ages of 8 and 14 years attended school 
twelve weeks or more. 

The Free High School Law proved a great incentive and, in 
my opinion, if a Constitutional Law can be framed, the 
incoming Legislature should do so. 

One of our best school laws is the one which provides for 
the transfering to a nearer school, and many of our children are 
greatly benefited by it. 

Another is the Free Text-Book Law. All our schools, except 
one, comply with its provisions. 

Many of our schools have excellent libraries, and if present 
efforts continue, all our schools will enjoy the many and desirable 
benefits of good libraries before many years. 

Our last two Institutes were successful beyond my expectations. 
The monthly meetings of our County Teachers' 
Associations are well attended and the work done is of a high 
character and practical nature. 

Geo. Horst, 

County Superintendent. 

RICHARDSON COUNTY. 

Richardson county contains 104 school districts: 96 rural 
schools, and 8 graded. It has no public schoolhouses : 99 
frame, 9 brick, r stone, and 1 iron; also, a business college, convent, 
and several German school buildings. Most of these 
houses are good buildings, and very well equipped with the 
necessary apparatus, and well located as to site. Since our last 
legislation the out-buildings are much improved and better kept. 

I am glad to note that our schools are advancing, the teachers 
are better equipped for their work, and the general interest 
throughout the county is better. In 1898 our school census was 
7,091, with an enrollment in the public schools the following 
year of 5,658. In 1899 our school census was 7,072, a decrease </seg>

of 19, yet the enrollment in the schools was 5,777, an increase 
over the preceding year of 119. 

In the public schools all the common branches are taught, 
except in one or two districts where instruction in physiology is 
not given only in a general way. In many of the rural schools, 
some one or two of the high school subjects is taught. Of the 
104 districts, 74 own their text-books. Our schools, and especially 
the rural schools, need a change of text-books. Quite a 
number of our rural schools are provided with libraries; some of 
them are small, yet well selected, and have received quite valuable 
additions within the past year. 

Graduation has been very unsatisfactory. Until this year 
there has been no definite attempt to follow the State Course of 
Study, but this year the County Superintendent has made a 
strenuous effort to have it followed in every school. Some 
schools fit nicely into the course while others do not; the hindrances 
having been caused largely by irregular and too short 
attendance of pupils, and, by uniform lengths of term of school. 
These two hindrances might be greatly removed by legislation: 
the former by more stringent compulsory attendance laws, 
requiring longer and more regular attendance at school; the latter 
by legislating the power of taxation away from the individual 
districts and placing it in some central body, who would lay the 
taxes on the entire county equally, having the same length of 
term of school in all districts. 

Last year each teacher made a full report of his or her school 
each month to the County Superintendent, but this year these 
reports are made only at the close of each quarter to adapt better 
to the course of study. The blanks for these reports are 
furnished by the count}', also pupils report cards to parents. 
Each quarter test questions for examination suited to the quarter's 
work of the course is sent out by the County Superintendent. 


No district is contracting with a neighboring district. 

The teachers of Richardson county will compare favorably 
with those of any other county in the State. Our schools require 
149 teachers, and they are, with very few exceptions, wide- </seg>

awake, enthusiastic and progressive. All read educational papers 
and over one hundred are carrying a regular course of reading. 

Our institutes have been instructive, largely academic, and 
enthusiastic. The interest manifested by those in attendance 
was greater than in former years. 

Two meetings each year of the County Association were held. 
These meetings were well attended and progressive. They 
usually began with a lecture on Friday evening followed by a 
regularly selected program on Saturday. 

Although we have not used all the regular Reading Circle 
books during the past two years, we have used some of them 
and substituted for the others, keeping up a regular reading 
course. Last year about ninety teachers did the work, and this 
year over one hundred are regular readers. Once every two 
months the County Superintendent sends out questions on the 
reading course to the readers, which they answer and return to 
be graded, a record of which is kept as well as a record of each 
teacher's work in the school, associations, and Institute, and on 
these records is based a system of credits which apply on the 
teacher's examination for a certificate. We believe the credit 
system a good thing when wisely used, but dangerous if abused. 

The number of certificates in force in this county exceeds by 
very little the number of teachers needed. But five teachers 
are teaching on third grade certificates. Over one hundred of 
our present teachers have had at least a high school education, 
and thirty-four others have received some high school instruction.

The material prosperity which is being enjoyed by the stockmen 
and farmers is likewise being recognized in school work. 
Several new schoolhouses have been built, but the most marked 
improvement is in the financial standings of all the districts. In

8TATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

The Teachers' Institute (Aug. 6-17, 1900,) was well attended, 
and noted for the honest and energetic work done by the teachers. 
They seemed to realize the responsibility of teaching. 
Profs. Gardner and Pease did excellent work. 

Teachers' meetings have been held once a month for the past 
year with fair attendance and a reasonable degree of success. 
Under this head a number of lectures have been delivered. I 
think a great deal of the Indiana school law relating to teachers' 
meeting. Perhaps such a law would cause more interest in 
teachers meetings in Nebraska. A number of teachers have 
done all of the Reading Circle work for the past year, and feel 
well repaid for their efforts. 

In visiting the schools of the county I find hundreds of dollars 
worth of high-priced charts, a very few good dictionaries, fewer 
good blackboards, and practically no libraries, there being 
only one that deserves the name. All is being done that is possible 
to change this order of things. While good charts at reasonable 
prices are excellent aids, they should not be purchased 
until the district has purchased a good blackboard, a good dictionary, 
and at least a small library. 

A number of districts have contracted with neighboring districts 
for the instruction of their pupils. In all cases said districts 
are well pleased. It is found a much cheaper way to furnish 
instruction where the number of pupils is small. 

The Nebraska Course of Study is in the hands of all teachers, 
and each district is furnished wtth a classification register. Slow 
but solid progress has been made in the attempt to grade the 
rural schools. 

The people, generally speaking, are much interested in having 
good schools, and, notwithstanding the fact that the county is 
very thinly settled, we have as good schools as can be found 
anywhere. 

While the average daily attendance is about 70 per cent of the 
total number of children of school age, there yet remains a 
good deal of room for material improvement. </seg>

SALINE COUNTY. 

The educational spirit of the Saline county schools is good, as 
shown by the interest taken by the teachers in Teachers' Associations 
and Teachers' Institutes as well as in the work of the 
schoolroom. The Nebraska Course of Study has been placed 
in the hands of every teacher in the rural schools of the county. 
I find that in most of the schools the course of study is intelligently 
followed in both classification and grading. Many of our 
rural schools have small libraries, and others are making an 
effort in the same direction. The teachers of our county are 
alive to the necessity of professional reading. The stimulus 
given pupils under Free High School Attendance Law has kept 
them in the high schools, notwithstanding the law has been 
declared unconstitutional. But one district in the county has 
contracted to furnish instruction for its pupils. The results 
have been highly satisfactory to both districts. If the contract 
law were more generally tried the schools would be greatly 
benefited thereby. The law with reference to stimulants and 
narcotics is scrupulously carried out in the matter of instruction 
in those subjects. Since our Legislature enacted a law furnishing 
the schools of our State with free text-books, it ought to 
have embodied in the same law provision for a free library for 
the use of the rural schools.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

The State Course of Study and Manual is used in all our 
rural schools, and is followed as closely as is consistent with 
existing conditions. The Superintendent is trying to grade the 
schools more closely each year. All of our village and many 
of our rural schools have added materially to their school 
libraries this year. 

The loss of our Free High School Attendance Law does not 
seem to have affected the attendance in the least. More pupils 
from the rural schools are attending the high school than ever. 

All teachers in Sarpy county have received at least a high 
school education, and the majority have had Normal school 
training. By keeping the standard of education high we have 
encouraged this higher preparation. 

Several new schoolhouses have been built this year, and 
nearly all buildings in the county are in good repair. Several 
two-room rural school buildings are maintained. The greatest 
drawback to our schools this year is our inability to secure 
teachers having professional training. 

Taken all together, the outlook in Sarpy county is encour-

SAUNDERS COUNTY. 

The educational spirit of Saunders county has been such, for 
the past two years, as to be quite encouraging to teachers, school 
officers and patrons alike. This fact has been fully attested by 
the increased interest in and number of teachers' meetings, Associations 
and Institutes held throughout the county. Especially 
has the educational body known as the County Association of 
Teachers, organized three years ago, become a powerful factor 
for good in the educational work of the county ; also the organization 
of a Superintendents and Principals' Association, whose 
object is to unify the course of study and to unify methods of 
instruction throughout the county. 

The Nebraska Course of Study has been introduced into 
every school, and is the only recognized course in the schools.

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

As a result, the country schools are in a fairly good state of 
gradation, but until school boards shall see the effectiveness and 
even necessity of such a course, or of some such course, it will 
be impossible to grade the rural schools as they should be graded. 
Especially is this so when we receive every year from twenty to 
forty teachers into our schools who are totally without professional 
training and without experience, and when the County 
Superintendent has barely enough time to visit each school in his 
county only once during the year, as required by the school law. 
And this is all he can do where there are 150 to 175 teachers to 
visit, because of the great amount of desk or office work which 
he is compelled to do and which consumes so much time. 

It therefore seems that we need this kind of legislation, not 
only in Nebraska, but everywhere, if our schools are to accomplish 
the results that are expected of them, and for which they 
were instituted. 

First, legislation that will make it impossible for anyone 
to secure license to teach who has not had reputable professional 
training, who fails in executive and disciplinary tests, and who 
has not attained a sufficiently mature age, such age not to be in 
any case below eighteen years. Too many persons are trying 
to teach, while they, themselves, are but little better than children. 
There should be a specific, statutory age limit. 

Second, that legislation which would enable the County Superintendent, 
if we are to have such an officer, and in counties 
where the number of teachers under his jurisdiction is 100 or 
over, to spend nearly all his time among his teachers, where he 
would have a chance to be of some help to them specifically, 
and, generally, to increase the efficiency of the entire educational 
machinery. This could easily be done if his office, under 
conditions above stated, were allowed a clerk or deputy. 

Unless the above, or some such similar conditions shall obtain, 
I am firmly convinced that much public money will continue to 
be paid out, as it is and has been paid out, to secure results that 
our schools are unable to give, and for which nobody in particular 
can justly be held responsible. The weakness of our school 
system is the species of legislation which controls it. '"The </seg>

common schools are the hope of our country," and we may 
justly say that the hope of our common schools rests with our 
legislators. 

Jesse M. Galixway, 

County Superintendent. 

SEWARD COUNTY 

Seward county is enjoying educational prosperity. Our school 
officers are generally liberal in supplying needed equipments for 
good school work. Our patrons are more deeply interested in 
the schools than ever before. During the past year a number 
of local educational meetings for the patrons and school officers 
have been held. In addition to this, a uniform system of pupils' 
report cards has been in use in the schools. To these two 
causes, largely, I attribute the growing interest of patrons and 
school officers. This would seem to indicate that it is due 
largely to thoughtlessness or a lack of understanding and appreciation 
of the importance of their duties, and not sheer indifference, 
that many people neglect the schools or fail to cooperate 
with the teachers and with each other in educational matters. 

Our teachers are supplied with copies of the State Course of 
Study and are following it as nearly as conditions will permit. 
Uniform examinations are held twice each year. Our schools 
are not thoroughly graded as yet; however, they are all working 
to a common plan and with a fair measure of success. 

Our teachers are of a better class than formerly. More than 
55 per cent of them have taught three years or more and only 
ii per cent are beginners; 10 per cent are Normal school or 
college graduates; 30 per cent have attended Normal schools a 
year or more; and 10 per cent have received less than two 
years' high school education. 

We have a well organized Teachers' Association which 
meets bi-monthly. Seventy-five of our teachers are doing the 
Reading Circle work, the local circles meeting at convenient 
points every two weeks. The results are most gratifying and 
our teachers are doing excellent work. 

I have found the one-week Institute, of a professional and </seg>

inspirational character, to be more helpful to our teachers than 
the Academic Institute, and that it pays to employ the best instructors 
obtainable. While many of our teachers need academic 
instruction, they are in greater need of professional training. 
During the past two years no certificate has been issued in this 
county on third-grade examination. 

Our teachers are not as well paid as they should be. But it 
is gratifying to note that the average annual salaries for teachers 
in this county have increased in the past two years from $273 
to $295, and the present year will place it safely above the $300 
mark. 

Much is needed in the way of school legislation. The High 
School Law was very beneficial and the good effects of it are 
yet very noticeable. Certainly our Constitution and Statutes are 
not such a . muddle that it is impossible for the people to get 
what they want and are entitled to under a "free school system" 
— namely free high school privileges. I see no valid objection, 
of any considerable merit, to county uniformity of taxation and 
uniform distribution of fines, licenses and railroad taxes. Then 
a statutory provision that all who finish the prescribed course in 
the district of their residence may attend free of charge any 
public school of higher grade in the county, would certainly be 
valid. I would also favor making the average yearly attendance 
the basis of apportionment. We are also greatly in need 
of two or three State Normal schools in addition to the very 
excellent one we now have. 

U. O. Anderson, 

County Superintendent. 

SIOUX COUNTY. 

The educational spirit of the county is better than it has been 
for a number of years. 

We have a Teachers' Association, but as the work is so scattered 
over the county and transportation not very good, it is 
difficult to secure a very large attendance. 

We held Teachers' Institute in August, and had a very successful 
Institute, and find our teachers are doing better work </seg>

STATE STXPERIXTElfDENT's REPORT. 

than ever before. We have yet the first complaint to hear from 
any district board or patrons of the schools against any of our 
teachers. 

Districts are not taking advantage of the law which enables 
them to contract with districts. Don't think they 
fully understand the law yet. 

The law with reference to narcotics and stimulants is carried 
out in all our schools. 

We need legislation to advance our schools in two ways. 
First we need a State or county school tax annually levied by 
the Board of County Commissioners, or by Statutes, so that all 
may help keep up the educational work of the county. The 
wealthiest part of this county pays no school tax, and in several 
instances the children are deprived of an education simply for 
the greed of parents to get too much of this world's goods. 
They don't care to have a school district for the reason that it 
makes them pay more taxes. We have had great trouble in 
organized districts to help out or receive any tuition from pupil's, 
coming in from unorganized territory, where, if there was a tax 
levied on all we would have better schools, for every one then 
would be interested. 

In the second place, I think the County Superintendent of 
these sparsely settled counties should receive a regular salary 
and not be placed in the hands of a jealous people, and a goodly 
number of them that can't understand the benefit of an education. 
A great many of this county think the educational work 
should not cost the count}' more than $200.00, and some will say 
$300.00. This might do if the schools were all near each other, 
but such is not the case. I, as County Superintendent of this 
county, have to look to other sources for a living, and therefore 
I feel that I am not doing justice by the schools, but what can 
I do as it now stands. On the other hand, if there was a salary, 
even the least interested would want to see me out at work, if 
nothing else than to earn my money. 

There are a great many things I could do for the schools 
under a salary that I dare not do without being slandered as an 
imposter on the public. 1 don't know how many counties there </seg>

are in the State m the same condition as this one, but I hope 
there are not many. 

We are trusting and hoping for more concentrated action for 
the good of educational work in the future. 

J. B. Burke, 

County Superintendent. 

THAYBR COUNTY 

The schools of this county were never in a more flourishing 
condition than at the present time. The people are alive to the 
advantages of the best schools, and take great pride in the 
progress made by their children. 

There are so many lines of work which need the attention 
of the County Superintendent, that it seemed best to concentrate 
effort on what appeared the most important, and through 
them reach the other ends aimed at. As the results obtained in 
our schools depend upon the teachers who have charge of them, 
the greatest effort during the past two years has been along the 
line of raising the standard of the teaching force. The means 
used were the Institute; the Teachers' Association; visitation; 
the teacher's library; Reading Circle work; circular letters; 
and insisting on a higher scholarship. 

The Institutes were made live and invigorating. This was 
done by choosing none but the best instructors, the best lectures, 
and great care in the arrangement of the classes and time schedule. 
The academic and lecture methods were combined, the 
object being to give methods of teaching rather than the subject 
matter; and to have the teacher get the method fixed through 
doing actual work — to "learn to do by doing." Each teacher 
was provided with a note-book, and required to hand it in for 
inspection at the close of each week. Much use of the notes 
taken is made during the year. No one class yields so much in 
results as the Beginners' Round Table. It places beginners on 
a firm footing and prepares them to enter directly upon the work 
in a systematic way. 

The Teachers' Association has been conducted by dividing 
the county into seven sections. Monthly meetings were held in </seg>

            <seg id="p304">
280 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

each section, while two, or three, general county meetings were 
held each year. A course of study was laid out for the year and 
placed in the hands of the teachers. The local managers 
arranged the details of the local programs. The following works 
have been studied: "CaldwelFs American History Studies" and 
"Skinner's Studies in Literature," were adopted for the general 
culture of the teacher. "Waymarks for Teachers," by Sarah 
Arnold, and "Roark's Method in Education," were used for pedagogical 
training. Questions on the work were prepared by the 
superintendent. The answers were handed in at the close of the 
year, and those teachers whose work was satisfactory and attendance 
on the association meetings regular, were excused from 
examination. 

From twenty to twenty-five teachers attend the State Teachers' 
Association each year. They return filled with new conceptions 
and energy for their work. All are urged to attend. Many 
attend Normal and summer schools to better fit themselves for 
their work. There are now eight college or university graduates 
teaching in the county. Also ten graduates from the complete 
course at Normal schools; eight graduates from the one year 
course at the State Normal; while twenty-one have attended 
summer or winter terms at Normal schools to take special training 
without completing a full course. Six others have attended 
a college or university for a year or more. Only one has had 
neither a high school training of some extent, nor attended a 
summer school. 

The teachers' library consists of 250 volumes of carefully 
selected books. Thirty of these have been added during the past 
biennium and more are to be added very soon. A classified list 
has been printed and furnished to teachers. 

1 he State Course of Study has been placed in the hands of 
every teacher with explicit directions to follow it to the limit of 
conditions present. Its use is urged at Institute, by circular letter 
and at association meeting. The schools are now graded, yet 
owing to the conditions in some districts it is still imperfect. 
In order to aid the teacher in keeping up the gradation, 
test questions are sent out each quarter. These questions are </seg>

            <seg id="p305">

COUNTY AND v CITY SCHOOLS. 

based upon the course of study, and they have done much to 
help in the gradation of the country school. The graduation of 
pupils from the eighth grade was held before teacher and pupil 
during the year. As a result seventy presented themselves for 
final examination, even after the Free High School Law wasdeclared 
unconstitutional and the hope of free tuition withdrawn. 
Diplomas were issued to those who passed, and graduating exercises 
were held. 

No other law has done more to stimulate regular attendance 
and a df sire for higher training than the Free High School Law. 
This stimulus was noticeable throughout the grades, and even 
the parents remarked about the eagerness of the children to 
complete the common school course. 

The classification record and report is required from each 
teacher at the close of the term or year. This record shows 
what work was done by each grade and saves valuable time for 
a successor. 

In addition to personal talks with members of school boards, 
circular letters have been issued in which the needs of the 
schools were portrayed, as well as the duties of the school board 
thereto. Recommendations in regard to hiring teachers, the 
purchase and care of text-books, repairing buildings, purchase 
of apparatus and supplies, and beautifying the grounds, have 
been made. A paper called the "School Bulletin," carried ita 
message each month last year to teachers and school boards. A 
special page was given to the school board. Two meetings in 
connection with the Farmers' Institute and one at the Teachers' 
Institute were planned. Dr. Henry Sabin addressed the latter- 
Supt. C. F. Beck met with one of them. 

An effort has been made to put libraries into our schools, and 
as a result, during the last two years forty schools have either 
placed a new library, or added to the one possessed, at a cost 
ranging from $4.00 to $70.00 each. Belvidere school has a 
library of over 500 volumes. The school and the home are 
thus brought closer together. The prevailing method of raising 
money has been by box or basket socials, and entertainments. 

Six new schoolhouses have been built, and a large amount of </seg>

repairing done to the extent of $2,500 a year. There are now 
5,354 children of school age; 98 school districts; 103 schoolhouses, 
and 128 teachers required to fill all the schools in the 
county. It cost $55,669.86 to run the schools last year. Eighteen 
months more of school were voted (in lots) for this year 
than last, which keeps up the tendency to hold longer terms of 
school. Only 5 districts held less than six months of school; 
22 held nine months, and 36 held eight months of school during 
the last year. There are but 6 districts out of the 98 which are 
bonded. W. H. Rhodes, 

Connty Superintendent. 

THURSTON COUNTY 

Perhaps there is no other county in the State of Nebraska 
where the progress of education is impeded by the obstacles 
that lie in the pathway of Thurston county, owing to the fact 
that the Omaha and Winnebago Indian reservations constitute 
the greater portion of the county lands, and that these lands are 
not subject to taxation. There are about sixteen townships in 
this county, but of that number less than two of them are taxable. 
To maintain the county government and raise revenues 
for current expenses the rate of taxation is enormously high and 
a. great burden upon the property available for taxation, leaving 
only a small per cent of the funds thus obtained to be applied 
on the school fund. 

The greater portion of the white population of this county 
consists of people who rent, occupy and cultivate the Indian 
lands. While the personal property of the tenants is taxed for 
the support of the schools in each district, the revenues are not 
sufficient to maintain them. This deficiency is provided for, in 
a measure, by the funds allotted to tfcis otPGnty from the school 
fund of the State, but when we take into consideration the fact 
that there are sixteen townships in the county which should 
have, at least, sixty schoolhouses, and that, outside of the Pender 
high school and the two government schools at the Winnebago 
and Omaha agencies, there are only twenty-seven schoolhouses, 
twenty-two of which have been built by private enterprise, it is </seg>

            <seg id="p307">
283 

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

evident that our educational facilities are not all they might be. 

Notwithstanding these environments, it is safe to say that those 
schools we now have will compare favorably with the schools 
of other counties more fortunately situated. We have good and 
efficient teachers who enter zealously into the spirit of the work 
which their great responsibility as architects of the youthful mind 
imposes upon them. It is through their efforts, aided by the 
patrons of the schools and by means of various entertaintments 
arranged for that avowed purpose, that our meagre libraries 
have been acquired. Along the lines of reading circles little 
has been accomplished, for the reason that the schoolhouses are 
too far apart to admit of organizing and successfully conducting 
the same. 

In those districts adjacent to the habitations of the Indians, 
situated in the eastern portion of the county, about one-half of 
the pupils in attendance at the schools are Indians or mixedbloods. 
Among the latter may be noticed a marked improvement 
in the acquisition of knowledge, which may be attributed 
to association with white children. While the Indian youth is a 
little slow in beginning to grasp the principles and methods 
employed in the schoolroom, he soon exhibits an aptitude and 
eagerness for learning almost equal to his white schoolmate. 
Arising from careful observation of these facts comes the 
thought that the plan of associating the races in the schoolroom 
might be followed to a greater extent with manifest benefit to 
the one without deteriorating from the standard of morality and 
intelligence of the other. Wm. H. Hill, 

County Superintendent. 

VALLEY COUNTY 

Valley county is divided into sixty-two school districts, of 
which three are high schools. Ord schools employ eleven 
teachers; North Loup employs five teachers; Arcadia employs 
three teachers. 

All three are doing work from the twelfth grade down to the 
tenth grade, respectively. The remaining fifty-nine districts are </seg>

            <seg id="p308">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

country schools, and employ one teacher in each district, and tryto 
secure the best in each place. 

The number of months has been increased in a great many 
districts. Wages have also increased in a great many districts. 

The Nebraska Course of Study is being used as a guide in 
most of the schools. The Institutes are well attended, and we 
usually have three or four county Teachers' Associations during 
the year, all of which are well attended. 

Very few of our rural schools are graded. The most of our 
teachers are competent and progressive, and the school boards 
are quite careful whom they employ as teachers, giving preference 
to those who attend Institutes and County Associations. 
The financial conditions of all districts are in better shape than 
for some time in the past, as is evidenced by the better repair of 
buildings and supplies of all kinds used in the schools. 

Reading Circle work is being carried on to quite an extent in 
the towns of Ord, North Loup and Arcadia. 

As the majority of our teachers come from the high schools of 
our county, I think we need some legislation along the lines of 
better preparation for our teachers. However, the prospects 
are bright for a successful school year for Valley county. 

L. Blessing, 

County Super inti iident. 

WASHINGTON COUNTY. 

The educational spirit of Washington county is in a most 
wholesome condition. The people respond liberally to the needs 
of the schools, and school boards are awake to the necessity of 
securing the best teachers. Nearly all our schools employ their 
teachers for the full year; only one school changed teachers last 
year. Each teacher has a copy of the State Course of Study 
and has her school graded to conform to it as closely as possible. 
Many of the schools graduated pupils from the eighth 
grade last year. The Free High School Attendance Law was 
a wonderful incentive to country pupils to complete the eighth 
grade work in the country school that they might have the 
advantages of the high school. This law, in my opinion, if </seg>

            <seg id="p309">

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

allowed to stand, would have done more in five years for the 
schools of the State than all other late school legislation combined. 
It should be reenacted, if possible, to make it stand the 
test of the Supreme Court. 

Our Countv Teachers' Association, of which all the teachers 
of the county are members, hold four meetings during each 
year. At these meetings subjects of most interest to the 
teachers and their work are discussed. The attendance and 

interest at these meetings are good. 

The Teachers' Reading Circle has become a fixed part of the 
educational work of this county. Our teachers, while not all 
agreed as to the wisdom of the Reading Circle Board in the 
selection of some of the books, are reading the course faithfully 
and diligently, and I am sure profitably. 

Only a few of our schools are purchasing a school library 
with public funds; many of them, however, are establishing 
school libraries with funds secured by a public school entertainment, 
box social or some similar means. The interest that 
pupils and patrons take in a library, as well as the good it will 
accomplish in a community, is umneasurable. Some legislation 
that would secure to the school and community a good and growing 
library would be a benefaction to the State. 

There have been built within the past two years five schoolhouses. 
Four of them with respect to their arrangement for 
light, heat, ventilation, etc., are strictly modern, the other is on 
the old "box-car" plan. Respectfully, 

G. C. Marshall, 

County Superintendent . 

WEBSTER COUNTY. 

Some compulsion is necessary in order to secure a full attendance 
at Teachers' Meetings and Institutes, yet we note a steady 
improvement. Each year the number asking for excuses from 
attendance decreases. Each year the number who are 
really enthusiastic, and work because they like to work, increases. 

The Teachers' Reading Circle work is a success here. Last 
year work was in literature and history. Any teacher absent </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT S REPORT. 

from monthly meetings is required to write out answers to 
questions, which are sent out monthly at the same time. A 
reason for absence must be forwarded to County Superintendent. 
All excuses filed in Superintendent's office. Work this 
year Roark, literature and current history. Attendance thus 
far, very good. Results of Reading Circle work already manifest 
in the schoolrooms. Libraries constantly receiving additions, 
and the pupils are learning to care for good reading. 

Many supplementary reading books introduced during the 
past year. The greatest obstacle with regard to pupils' Reading 
Circles has been the unwillingness of parents to purchase 
books. We have about twenty-five pupils' Reading Circles in 
good working order. Questions are sent out to aid teachers and 
pupils in this work. If books could be furnished free, we might 
score a great success in this line another year. 

Our rural schools are graded; not much difficulty in following 
course of study until sixth grade. 

From this on, pupils in some districts are irregular in attendance 
— kept out of school by parents. Many grow discouraged and 
leave school toward close of seventh grade. The Free High 
School Law was a help in this county; it furnished an incentive, 
parents enjoyed commencement exercises, also enjoyed eighth 
grade certificates, and made an effort to send their children to 
high school. 

Attendance of high schools slightly diminished this year, but 
is still good. Instructions in stimulants and narcotics given in 
all our schools; not always effective, however. 

As to needed legislation, our needs in this county are in about 
the following order : 

First. A law setting aside, yearly, a certain amount of public 
funds for the maintenance of pupils' Reading Circles and school 
libraries. Selections of books, to be made by County Superintendent, 
teacher of district and a third party chosen by them. 

Second. A legal Free High School Law. 

Third. A law compelling attendance of teachers at Institute 
and teachers' meetings, compelling work of Reading Circle. 
These matters not left optional with the County Superintendent, </seg>

but required by State law. Require all excuses for absence 
from these educational functions to be forwarded to State Board 
and acted upon by them. 

Fourth. Establishment of a State Normal school in central 
Nebraska. 

Fifth. Quarterly examinations for teachers. 

Sixth. County Superintendent's term of office five years; 
ineligible for reelection. 

EvaJ. Case, 

County Superintendent. 

WHEELER COUNTY 

The people of Wheeler manifest a commendable interest in 
education by voting taxes to maintain schools where there are 
very few pupils, but do not visit the schools as they should. 
There are several commodious buildings, well furnished with 
charts, books, dictionaries, etc. It is my practice to visit each 
school — once, at least — during each term, to see that the teacher 
has a " Course of Study," and encourage her to follow plan 
indicated and leave a record of her work for her successors. 
Our aim is to properly grade all schools. There is a demand 
for qualified and experienced teachers. 

We hold a two weeks' Institute each year and strive to do 
thorough, practical work that will be felt during the succeeding 
year. Teachers willingly attend — seldom ask to be excused, 
and receive credit for faithfulness and attention. 

L. I. Cooke, 

County Superintendent. 

YORK COUNTY 

A good educational spirit is shown in York county. The City 
of York and the county in general take pride in the educational 
and moral standing attained, the standard of teachers' qualifications 
has been raised to equal that of any county in the State. 
The active, progressive spirit of the teachers is shown in the 
large attendance and spirited work at the Summer Institute and 
in Teachers' Meetings. Nearly every teacher in the county is </seg>

            <seg id="p312">
STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

288 

an active member of the County Teachers' Association and 
Reading Circle, which meets every month. Local meetings 
at eleven points in the county have been held the past year, 
the average attendance each month being larger than the number 
of teachers required for the schools of the county. 

The Nebraska Course of Study and Teachers' Manual is 
being used in every school in the county, and rural schools are 
becoming well graded. 

A large number of pupils are graduated each year from the 
common schools. Over one hundred pupils took the county 
pupils' examination at the close of the school year in the spring 
of 1900. 

The Free Attendance High School Law gave a great impetus 
to the rural schools. Since this law has been declared unconstitutional, 
an effort has been made to help keep up the spirit of 
the law by granting "certificates of proficiency" to pupils completing 
the work of the common schools. These certificates 
indicate completion of the common branches, and qualification 
to enter the high school. With this encouragement and the 
hope of a better High School Attendance Law in the future that 
will stand the test, the number of pupils preparing to complete 
the course and pass the examination seems undiminished. An 
effort has been made the past year toward establishing school 
libraries and replenishing those already started. With this 
object in view, school entertainments, basket suppers and other 
attractions follow each other in succession over the county. The 
school library cylopasdia has been adopted by the County 
Teachers' Association as a reference work for school libraries. 
This is a valuable addition to the school library. 

The law providing for attendance of pupils at a nearer school 
has won merited praise from school patrons. Over fifty pupils 
have been transferred under its provisions the present year. 

Good results are also coming from the Compulsory Attendance 
Law, especially in districts containing large numbers of 
foreigners. 

Antagonism in a few districts between the German and 
English schools has hindered good work in the past, but the </seg>

contending parties are gradually becoming reconciled to each 
other, and the outlook for the future is good. 

York county claims a place in the front rank of educational 
forces in Nebraska, and expects to hold her place by merit, and 
thus aid in the forward movement of the State as a whole.

REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF HIGH SCHOOLS. 

To the Chancellor and Board of Regents of the University of 
Nebraska, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 

Gentlemen: — I take pleasure in submitting my second 

biennial report of the inspection of Nebraska high schools. I 
have given my entire time during the school year to the work 
of inspection, visiting from three to five schools a week. My 

visits for the year 1899- 1900 were as follows: 

Number of high schools visited 90 

Number of high schools visited twice . . 7 

Number of high schools visited three times 3 

Number of academies visited 4 

Number of accredited schools not visited 7 

Number of normal schools visited 3 

Number of colleges visited 5 

Educational conventions attended 10 

Number of schools accepted for the accredited list 82 

In inspecting a school 1 follow, as far as circumstances permit, 

the following plan: ( 1 ) Spend a full day in the school. 
(2) Visit each instructor during representative recitations. 
(3) Examine carefully the material equipment of the school. 
(4) Investigate the organization and classification of the school 
throughout. (5) Visit a few eighth grade classes. (6) Confer 
with the instructors. (7) Consult with the superintendent. 

(8) Meet with the board of education. 

During the last two years high school conditions have per- 

ceptibly improved. Schools have gained not only in point of 
enrollment, strength of courses of study, and scholarship of 

20</seg> 

            <seg id="p314">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

instructors, but progress has been made in accommodations, 
scientific equipment and library facilities. The high school 
enrollment of the accredited schools is, at least, 20 per cent 
above that of two years ago, and the total number of graduates 
about 30 per cent higher. The courses of study have been 
strengthened by cutting out the less essential branches and giving 
additional time to the more essential. Boards of education 
of accredited schools use greater care than ever before in the 
selection of their teachers for high school subjects. They practically 
demand a college education as the minimum requirement 
of high school instructors in all our best schools. When a 
teacher of lower scholarship is elected, it is either because of 
very successful experience, or because no suitable graduate is 
available. It is now the practice to elect only college graduates, 
and only such as are recommended or approved by the University. 


Experience. — While, in the selection of instructors, there 
has been great gain from the standpoint of scholarship, there 
has been some loss from the standpoint of experience. In many 
cases a college graduate without experience has taken the place 
01 an experienced teacher of lower scholarship. Usually the 
change has proved beneficial, even though the new college 
graduate has sometimes failed to grasp, at once high school conditions. 
My observation shows that these instructors of higher 
scholarship do not remain long enough in a place. After holding 
positions as assistants one or two years, they either get 
promotion to principalshlps or to college positions, or secure 
positions outside the teaching profession. As there are few college 
graduates who have had experience in teaching and who 
desire high school positions, vacancies are filled, largely, by 
graduates without experience. At the last election of teachers 
it was easily seen that more than the usual attention was given 
to experience, which resulted in better salaries in many schools. 
A more general demand for college graduates of experience 
will give a corresponding increase in salaries, which will mean 
teachers- for a longer term of years.

efficient management at the present time. Most Superintendents 
are men of scholarship and executive ability, and well qualified 
for the positions they hold. I have found, however, that they 
are forced to teach too many branches. In the smaller schools 
the Superintendent should teach a few classes, but it is a serious 
mistake on the part of the board of education to allow insufficient 
time for supervising the work below the high school. In 
a number of schools the weakness in the grades is directly 
traceable to a lack of proper supervision. This means weakness 
in the high school in a few years. Occasionally a board of 
education advocates getting along without a Superintendent, but 
the number holding that opinion is rapidly decreasing. In most 
cases where the superintendency has been abolished for a year, 
or where the Superintendent has been required to devote all of 
his time to the high school, it has been due to the financial condition 
of the district, rather than to a lack of appreciation of the 
services of a good Superintendent. 

Boards of Education. — My observation fails to justify the 
criticism often made that "members of the board of education 
are men unfit for any other office." As a rule I find them to be 
the leading business men and most influential professional men of 
the town. The question of party politics or church affiliation very 
seldom enters into the election and dismissal of high school teachers. 
In these matters boards act largely upon the advice of their 
Superintendent. It is a common practice, also, to write the 
Inspector for confidential information about applicants. In only 
a few instances have boards elected teachers where this confidential 
information would not warrant such action. It may be 
added that less care is taken in the selection of grade teachers. 
That is a matter to which this office is giving special attention at 
the present time. 

Equipment. — No fault can be found with the equipment of 
the schools. There is hardly a school that has not put as much 
money in apparatus and reference books, during the last year,, 
as the financial condition of the district would justify. Many 
times 1 have considered it necessary to caution boards against 
going beyond their means. It very seldom occurs that a recom- </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

mendation of the University is not met promptly by the board 
of education, even where the outlay amounts to several hundred 
dollars. It is our desire to use this influence of the University 
very cautiously, and to recommend only what is absolutely 
necessary for good work and no more than is consistent with 
the size of the school and its financial condition. 

Courses of Study. — Not only accredited schools, but the 
smaller graded schools conform their courses of study to the 
standard courses recommended by the State Department of 
Education and the University. This gives as much uniformity 
as is desirable. The high school courses of the State are as 
near the suggestive State Courses as local conditions will warrant. 
The adoption of entrance requirements based on what 
is actually done in the best high schools instead of what is 
required for entrance to other colleges, is the most important 
action ever taken by the University in matters pertaining to the 
secondary schools. It is a formal recognition by the University 
that this institution is a part of the great public school system of 
this State. This action at once closes the gap that has heretofore 
existed between the high school and the University. 

A Bad Tendency. — The strong desire of high schools to 
affiliate closely with the University, while on the whole beneficial, 
has produced an unfortunate tendency among the smaller 
schools to carry heavier high school courses of study than is 
consistent with the size of the town. This gives overcrowded 
programs anu overworked teachers. It gives a top-heavy 
course of study. It means that if the high school work is well 
done, the work of the grades is neglected. Still worse, it means 
a reaction in the school sentiment of the community in a few 
years, which will place the standard as much too low as it is now 
too high. 

The University has advised against these heavy courses, and 
yet University influence is responsible, in a measure, for this 
tendency. The influence comes from the announcement that 
certain studies usually called "preparatory," now carried by the 
University, will be dropped in a short time. The high schools 
expect, each year, this action of the University to take place </seg>

            <seg id="p317">
293 

COPNTY AND CITT SCHOOLS. 

the following year, whereas they may be sure that no such 
change will be made without ample notice. They prepare for 
it by making a four-year course of study to fit their graduates 
for freshman classes. Fully half of the high schools of this 
State carrying four years ought to carry only three. This 
would permit paying better salaries, which would mean retaining 
stronger teachers. It would enable districts to have better 
laboratory and library facilities, and assure more thorough and 
efficient work. 

There are twenty-five or thirty high schools in the State large 
enough, and strong enough financially, to carry four years work; 
there are sixty or seventy that could safely attempt three years. 
It would be unwise to limit our accredited schools to the twentyfive 
ready to do four years, because that would place certain 
portions of the State at a disadvantage. It seems to me that it 
would be equally unwise to force the sixty or seventy weaker 
places to go beyond their means in order to reach the University, 
yet, by including these, almost every county would be provided 
with a school whose graduates could enter the University. 
In other words, the conditions in this State are such that the 
University ought, for many years, to continue to receive the 
graduates of good three-year high schools and to arrange the 
courses in the University so that such students can graduate in 
due time. Graduates of three-year courses enter now, but the 
announcement that the University will, in the near future, drop 
all so-called "preparatory" work, is doing harm. If it could be 
announced officially, that the University has no present intention 
of placing the minimum entrance requirements out of reach of 
good three-year schools, and that graduates from such schools 
will not be placed at a disadvantage on entering, it would greatly 
lessen the tendency to top-heavy courses among the smaller 
accredited schools. At least this is a question that should receive 
careful attention on the part of the Chancellor and the Board of 
Regents. 

The past biennium has been a period of quiet, persistent 
work, with an encouraging improvement in the high school conditions,

teachers and in high school graduates. The biennium ends with 
the most cordial relations possible between the University and 
accredited high schools. 

In conclusion I desire to recognize the uniform courtesy of 
your board and the kind personal reception accorded to me by 
the schools of the State. Very truly yours,

CITY SCHOOLS. 

ARAPAHOE. 

The Arapahoe Public Schools were first graded according lo 
the State Course of Study in 1894, and at that time a corps of 
seven teachers was employed. In 1897, under the supervision 
of R. H. Graham, the high school was recognized by the 
authorities of the State University and was placed in the A class 
of accredited schools with twenty-three credits. This recognition 
aroused a new spirit of enthusiasm for education in Arapahoe, 
and every year we send from two to four graduates to 
enter upon some university or professional course. The influence 
of the school is felt in the surrounding country, and from 
twenty to thirty non-resident pupils are enrolled every year at 
a tuition fee of $2.00 per month. 

Before leaving the high school the pupil must complete three 
years Latin, solid geometry and preparatory botany, physics and 
¦chemistry. 

Six teachers are employed in the grades. Special attention is 
given to the new constructive method in English and much 
drill in every grade is given in mental arithmetic. The Speer 
method is used in the first, second and third grades. Arithmetic 
is also reviewed in the ninth grade of the high school, and as 
the exigency demands, all common branches are reviewed in the 
last two grades of the high school, so that if the graduates are 
not financially able to enter the University, they are well 
¦equipped with some additional normal training, to begin teaching. </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOL8. 

A special music teacher has just been employed this year, and 
vocal music will be a permanent feature of our public school 
curriculum. In the employment of other teachers in the past 
the board of education has selected teachers of normal schools 
for the grades, and as near as possible University graduates for 
the high school. The teachers in the grades have either had 
training in a normal school or have attended summer schools at 
various colleges. J. C. McReynolds, an undergraduate of the 
State University, is principal of the high school. 

An excellent library has been provided, and a definite amount 
of reading is required and literary work is also required of all 
pupils beyond a certain age. 

A literary society under the auspices of the high school meets 
every Friday evening. Credit in the regular course is given for 
all rhetorical work rendered at the literary society. 

An excellent school spirit pervades the town. The district 
has seldom been in debt and then for only a short time. The 
board of education is liberal and public spirited and is made up 
of the best business and professional men of the town. At 
present J. H. Mooney is secretary and J. E. W. Richards is 
president. R. H. Graham,

ASHLAND. 

The enrollment in the Ashland schools for 1900 was 625. 
The number in the high school was 163. There are 27 in the 
present graduating class; 193 students have graduated in the 
last twelve years. 

Twelve grades of work are carried, following the course of 
study adopted by the board in 1898. 

Ten teachers are employed in the grades and four in the high 
school. _ 

s 

Two buildings are used, both brick. The main one is situated 
in a fine location in a convenient part of the town, with spacious 
grounds and numerous shade trees. 

Twelve teachers are engaged in this, and two in the ward 
building in the east part of town. This arrangement gives </seg>

advantage in supervision. Besides making thorough and efficient 
work in all the grades an especial feature, expression and 
literature in reading, and clear and definite analysis in arithmetic 
are being emphasized this year. A special teacher has charge 
of vocal music which is taught in all the grades. 

The vertical system of penmanship was adopted sometime 
ago, and good results have been obtained. 

Rhetorical work is required of all pupils. The literary society 
of the high school meets every Friday evening in the high 
schoolroom, and has been in successful operation for nearly 
twelve years. It was owing largely to this work that the school 
attained such a high rank in the district and State declamatory 
contests. 

The library association, managed and controlled by the 
students, has sustained, for several years, an excellent library for 
school purposes. It has done much to develop a taste for good 
reading. There are two courses of study in the high school, 
the Latin, and the general or elective course. Two demands are 
met, entrance to the State University, and preparation for 
teachers' examination. A very large number of the graduates 
enter the University at Lincoln, and other colleges, where they 
have always taken a high standing. Many of them hold, at 
present, responsible positions in schools throughout the State. 
Athletics have been given a prominent place, and the school is 
proud of its past victories in football and on the diamond. 

The school interest in Ashland is good indeed. The town is 
thoroughly American. There are only half a dozen pupils of 
foreign birth in the school. 

The teachers receive the hearty support of the board, which 
is composed of practical business and professional men. Mr. 
George C. Shedd is principal of the high school, and is ably 
assisted by Miss Duty von Mansfelde, and Miss Ada Du Bois. 
All are graduates of the State University.

BEATRICE. 

Forty-seven teachers are employed in the public schools of the 
City of Beatrice. This number includes a supervisor of primary 
work, and special teachers in drawing, manual training and 
music. The teachers are energetic in work and active \o 
improving their ability to instruct. The excellent standing of 
the Beatrice schools is due to the faithful and enthusiastic work 
of the teachers. 

The enrollment for the year which closed in May, 1900, was 
2,490. This was 98 per cent of the school census. The enrollment 
in the high school was 11 per cent of the total enrollment. 
For the current year the per cent of the enrollment in the high 
school is over sixteen per cent. It is believed that this condition 
can be duplicated by no other city in the State. 

The expenditure for the support of this system of schools during 
the past year was $30,890. The cost of educating a pupil 
for the year, based upon the yearly enrollment, was $12.40; 
based upon average daily attendance, the cost was $18.07. 

This year a manual training plant has been established at a 
cost of $1,200. A special instructor is employed at a yearly 
salary of $600. The department is supplied with twenty-one 
benches, each of which has a complete set of tools for wood-work. 
The boys of the seventh, eighth and ninth grades are given two 
hours of shop-work per week. By means of this work it is 
hoped to increase the interest of the boys in their schoolwork, 
and thus to hold them longer in school, to train the eye and the 
hand to be worthy companions to the mind, to help the boy to 
discover himself, and to dignify the cause of labor. 

Beatrice prides herself especially in her high school. For the 
current year the enrollment has reached 307. All the factors 
necessary to the development of a strong high school are presen 
— an able corps of instructors, an enthusiastic and earnest 
student body, and an ample equipment. Literary work is encouraged. 
In debate, the school stands second to none in the State. 
Athletics, under the joint management of faculty and students, 
are fostered. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT S REPORT. 

Through the financial stress to which this district has been 
subjected, the board of education has been true to its trust. The 
power of the schools has in no wise been impaired. To these 
men and women the City of Beatrice is indebted in full measure 
for the strength and efficacy of her public school system.

BLAIR 

Fully one-half of the school children of Blair are now housed 
in the finest school building in the State, in the opinion of many 
who have visited it during the past four months. On the first 
floor are six schoolrooms, one for each of the four primary 
grades and two fifth-grade rooms. The second floor is for 
high school purposes, and includes a beautiful assembly and 
study room nearly sixty feet square, four recitation rooms, and 
an office. On the first floor are the Superintendent's office and 
a library room. In the basement are toilet rooms, the boilers, 
and rooms that may be used for manual training. The entire 
building is well lighted and ventilated. The indirect gravity 
system of steam heat is used, and the old Central building on 
the same block of ground is heated by direct radiation fiom the 
new plant. The old Central contains the sixth, seventh and 
eighth grades. There are two other brick school buildings in 
Blair of two and three rooms, respectively, containing primary 
grades. 

The average number of pupils in the primary rooms average 
about forty, the grammar grades above fifty, and in the high 
school are enrolled 145. The teaching force includes Superintendent, 
high school principal, three other high school 
instructors, seventeen grade teachers, and a special supervisor of 
music. 

In the high school there are two courses, the English and the 
Latin, differing only in the language through the four years. 
Mathematics and the sciences are the same for both courses, 
«ach extending throughout the four years. The sciences include </seg>



            <seg id="p324">299 

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

physical geography, physiology, botany, zoology, physics and 
chemistry. 

Vocal music is taught in all the grades. In the primary and 
grammar grades there are daily lessons of from fifteen to twenty 
minutes in length, and in the high school three lessons a week, 
each twenty minutes in length. The special supervisor conducts 
the instruction in the high school, visits each grade room once 
each week, and instructs the grade* teachers one hour each 
week. Charts, books and blackboards are used in instruction. 
Teachers that cannot successfully leach the subject exchange 
rooms with those who can for a twenty-minute period daily.

Superintendent. 

CRETE. 

The public schools of Crete are well equipped, and are in the 
hands of teachers who are striving to advance the best interests 
of their pupils. They are ably supported in this by a school 
board composed of men who are generous and public-spirited 
enough to spend time and effort to keep the Crete schools 
among the foremost in the State. 

The enrollment for this year to date, November 23, is 640, of 
which number 134 are in the high school. 

Eighteen teachers, including the superintendent and special 
teacher of stenography and typewriting, are employed. 

In the high school the courses in the languages, Latin, Greek 
and German, are partially elective, but all graduates take 
English, history, sciences and mathematics. 

The experiment of introducing algebra in the eighth grade, 
for the last month of the year, has given good results. Interest 
in the new subject was aroused, and pupils began the study in 
the fall with good courage. Factoring receives special attention; 
pupils factor at sight, and read results without writing them. 
Geometry is studied one month in the spring by the tenth grade, 
thus giving a start for the next year's work. McDonald's text, 
supplemented by several others, is used. Our motto in geome- </seg>

try is "Let him know a thing because he has found it out for 
himself, and not because you have told him." 

In history the source method is followed as closely as possible. 
Special studies in American history are given during the first 
two years of the high school, followed by Greek and Roman history 
in the fourth year. 

English is arranged to occupy two periods each week throughout 
the high school course.* Skinner's Studies in English forms 
the basis of the study for the first two years, and a thorough 
interpretative study of various masterpieces is made during the 
last two years. 

The chemical laboratory is well equipped, and arranged with 
thirty-eight individual desks. Each pupil is provided with a 
full set of apparatus and chemicals required by Nicholson and 
Avery's Manual of Chemistry. The lecture table is supplied 
with electricity for demonstration purposes, and city water is 
furnished in abundance for use of all pupils. 

In botany the class is provided with nine good microscopes, a 
microterne for technical work and a herbarium of 1,500 specimens. 


A good supply of apparatus for demonstrating dynamics, electricity 
and light is found in the physical department. 

All pupils have the opportunity of one year or more in typewriting, 
stenography and bookkeeping, thus giving a fair 
knowledge of the essentials for a business career. 

Thoroughness in every department of the school is the watchword, 
and the teachers are united in their efforts to show good 
results as a justification of their labors.

FALLS CITY 

The history of the Falls City schools dates back to the year 
1858, when the first school was held in a shanty, 12x14, w ' tn an 
enrollment of eight pupils. Since then the growth of the schools 
has been rapid. 

In 1 87 1 a large two-story frame building was erected at a cost </seg>

            <seg id="p326">

COUNTY AND OITY SCHOOLS. 

of $2,500. By 1876 the number of pupils had increased to such 
an extent that a new building was needed, and the large Central 
school was built of brick at a cost of $20,000. The building 
was finished in 1877, and the schools were graded. This was 
the year the smallpox raged, and the schools were closed for 
some time. In 1888 a new building being needed, the Harlan 
street school was built for the primary grades. This building is 
also of brick, contains two large well-equipped rooms and cost 
$4,500. In 1892 a small frame building was added, and in 1893, 
the contract let for the high school building to cost $17,500. 

There are now enrolled in the schools 763 pupils, who are 
under the control of eighteen efficient teachers. The teaching 
force is unusually strong. In the high school are four graduates 
of the State University, and nearly all the grade teachers have 
had special preparation for their work. The primary department 
is especially strong, due to the teachers and the equipment. 
We pay especial attention to the kindergarten work during the 
first year. 

The Falls City high school is in the "A" class of accredited 
schools, there being but seven schools ahead in the number of 
credits. 

With an exceptionally intelligent and progressive board we 
hope this year to increase our efficiency throughout the schools, 
and raise the standard of the schools still higher. 

W. H. Pillsbury, 

Superintendent. 

FAIRBURY. 

The city schools of Fairbury are controlled by a board of 
education composed of one physician, two lawyers, one minister, 
one editor and one merchant. Eighteen teachers are 
employed, four of whom are in the high school and fourteen in 
the grades. Nearly all the teachers are residents of Fairbury 
or vicinity. With few exceptions teachers of the grades hold 
first grade certificates, and those in the high school all have life 
certificates. The average salary in the high school at present is 
$60 and in the grades $45. </seg>

            <seg id="p327">
STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

302 

The census shows nearly 1,100 children of school age and the 
enrollment nearly 1,000, about thirty of whom at present are 
non-residents. The high school offers two courses — the Latin 
and the English-German, but over two-thirds of the high school 
are registered in the Latin course. Eleven students were graduated 
in 1900 and the class of 1901 numbers ten. 

The district is divided into three wards: the south and west 
each have a four-room brick building in which work from the 
first to the fifth grades, inclusive, is done. The central ward 
also has a brick building in which is located the high school as 
well as the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. About two 
blocks distant is the two-room frame building occupied by the 
first, second and third grades of the central ward. 

The buildings are so situated and the grades so arranged that 
the average distance for pupils below the sixth grade does not 
exceed five blocks. The annual expense of maintaining the 
school* is nearly $12,000. The cost per year of educating a 
pupil, based on enrollment is $10.87; based on the average daily 
attendance in $16.57. 

The general policy is still, as it has been, "to secure thoroughness 
and wholesome discipline." Only so much work is 
attempted as the number of teachers will justify, and the constant 
aim is to give the community the highest results possible 
in return for the money devoted to the education of its children. 

A. L. Cairness, 

Superintendent. 

FREMONT. 

The Fremont schools have been enjoying a steady growth. 
Last year the enrollment reached 2,113. There are forty-three 
teachers, not including the superintendent. There are nine 
buildings, all in good repair, but one. 

Remarkable progress and improvement have been made during 
the past year in penmanship throughout the schools. The 
vertical system is used. No special teacher is employed. 

Much attention has been given recently to schoolroom decoration. 
Good pictures, copies of masterpieces, suitably framed, </seg>

have been used. Several hundred dollars worth have been purchased. 
The investment will undoubtedly yield good returns. 

Speer number work and synthetic reading are successfully 
used in the primary grades. Picture study is receiving attention 
in all grades. 

The high school course of study has been strengthened by the 
addition of considerable English, some history and another year 
of Latin. The course now entitles graduates to full entrance 
credit at the University. The high school has two cadet companies 
and the necessary arms for the same. An enviable record 
has been made in the Stale and district oratorical contests in the 
past eight years. Fremont has won seven first prizes at the 
district contests and six first prizes at the State contests. Considerable 
interest is taken in the high school publication — "The 
Spectator," and in athletics in its various forms. 

The president of the board of education, in his last annual 
report says: "I am confident our public schools never have been 
in better condition, in every way, than they are to-day." 

Some of the needs of the Fremont schools are: 

i. More room for the high school. 

2. A new central school building. 

3. A school library. 

4. A special teacher of music. 

5. Compulsory education law enforced.

GENEVA. 

Geneva schools are in charge of an able corps of teachers. 
A more loyal board of education cannot be found. Patrons 
manifest a deep interest in all matters of education. No city in 
Nebraska leads Geneva in the moral and intellectual standard of 
her young people. 

Our teachers are abreast of the times in the latest and best 
methods. In the primary grades the Speer method in numbers 
is giving excellent results. In the intermediate and grammar 
grades the Spiral Plan in arithmetic is proving a great success. </seg>

8TATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

The Skinner Method in English is the delight of teachers and 
pupils throughout the school. Juniors and seniors are enthusiastic 
in the study of Dr. Sherman's Questions on Macbeth, 
Othello, Hamlet and Julius Caesar. Those in American history 
and in Greek and Roman history, know enough of "Source 
Study" to actually believe there are such men abroad in the 
land as Caldwell and Fling. 

In the high school we have three courses of study. "Course 
A" prepares for entrance into the freshman year at the State 
University. At the present writing four young women and six 
young men represent Geneva high school at the University. 
•"Course B" gives special attention to pedagogy. Three of the 
present corps of teachers are graduates of the school, and several 
of the most successful teachers of Fillmore county are 
indebted to Geneva high school for their professional training. 
"Course C" is a more practical line of work than either of the 
other two. One year in commercial arithmetic, one year in 
actual business practice and practical bookkeeping, business 
correspondence and commercial law are special features of this 
course. It also has three years of German. 

During the past two years our patrons' meetings have exerted 
a great influence for the success of the school. We have been 
favored at some of these meetings by addresses from such men 
as Hon. W. R. Jackson, Supt. Saylor, Prof. Clemmons, and 
Chancellor Andrews. On November 28, 1900, over two 
hundred patrons visited the schools. This was an extra day, of 
course. A debate in German on the "Woman Question" 
brought out many of the German-speaking people of the city. 
It was also library day. Besides, Dr. Andrews was with us. 

Music is given special attention in the high school, under the 
efficient direction of Prof. H. E. Bradford, principal. Two 
quartettes, the Zobo Club, and the Mozart Club are musical 
organizations of which the school is justly proud. 

Inter-high school debates and declamatory contests have done 
much to promote the true student spirit. Our people prefer 
such exercises to athletics.

«ASTINGS. 

The Hastings schools have, at present, an enrollment of 1,700 
pupils, which is something of an increase over any previous year. 
There are five teachers employed in the high school, and thirtytwo 
teachers in the grades from the first to the eighth grades, 
inclusive. The course of study embraces twelve grades, the 
four highest grades of work constituting the high school course. 
The schools are divided into wards, two of which require seven 
teachers each, two six teachers each, and one four teachers. The 
eighth grade is separate from the other grades, and two teachers 
are employed exclusively for this grade. Special teachers are 
employed for the subjects of music and drawing. We have 
been somewhat crowded in our schoolwork during the past few 
years, especially so in the high school and in the primary grades. 
Financially, it is an opportune time to agitate the submission of 
bond proposition for a high school building. I think the patrons 
and citizens in general are now ready to have the question of 
high school bonds submitted, which will very likely be done 
during the present school year. High school bonds will undoubtedly 
carry when submitted, and then the crowded condition will 
be relieved. 

The salaries of the high school teachers range from $60 to 
$111 per month. Intermediate and grammar grade teachers 
receive from $45 to $60 per month, and primary teachers from 
$50 to $55 per month. The salaries are such as to enable us to 
•employ the best of teachers, and this we are endeavoring to do. 
We believe that our schools will compare favorably with any 
schools in the State in amount and quality of work done.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

HEBRON. 

The public schools of Hebron are under the management of 
a board of education, the members of which, both individually 
and as a board, have spared no pains and expense to bring the 
standard of the schools up until there are few, if any, of their 
size that surpass them in efficient and up-to-date methods. 

Hebron employs eleven teachers, has a school population of 
over 500, of which the November report of 1900 shows 450 
have been enrolled. 

There are two buildings. The larger is a substantial brick 
structure costing about $25,000 or $30,000. It is heated by 
steam. All text-books, pencils, pens and practice paper, in 
short, everything needed by the pupils, is furnished by the 
board. 

The financial condition of the district has been carefully 
looked after. During the hard times teachers' warrants were 
paid promptly, thus avoiding the unpleasant necessity toteachers 
of either having to wail for their cash or discount warrants. 
In the school year of 1899- 1900 the board paid, in addition 
to the running expenses of the school, an old debt of some fifteen 
years' standing, amounting to nearly $2,000, and then 
closed the year with all bills paid — this, too, in spite of the fact 
that the Supreme Court decision threw the district out of some 
$500 tuition. The levy for last year was 18 mills, for this year 
it is 20, five mills below the limit allowed by law. Hebron has 
no license and the board has demonstrated that public schools 
can be run on a cash basis without the aid or consent of "saloon 

&gt;» 

money. 

The graduates of 1900 were recognized at the State University 
with 27 credits. Under the present system, graduates of 
1901 will probably have 29 points. 

The enrollment in the high school is 91. A four-years' course 
is offered without option to the pupils, except that they may exercise 
their choice as to taking up Latin in the ninth year, as only 
three years of Latin are required. 

Including the Superintendent, who teaches one-half time, there </seg>

are four high school teachers, two of whom are graduates of 
the Nebraska University and one of Cornell, Iowa. 

Music is taught in all the grades from first primary through 
the high school, under the supervision of a special music teacher. 

W. H. Wagner, 

Superintendent. 

LINCOLN. 

The attendance in the Lincoln schools for the year 1899-1900, 
shows a marked increase over that of preceding years, and a 
corresponding increase is promised for the current year. The 
total enrollment was 7,003 pupils, or 425 more than that of the 
preceding year. The increase in average membership was 362, 
and in average attendance 366. 

The accommodations in the High, Capitol, Elliott, Bryant and 
Bancroft schools especially are taxed to their utmost and in some 
cases exceeded, necessitating frequent shifting of classes and 
pupils. The enrollment in the high school during the year was 
1,015, with an average attendance of 797. 

An investigation into the cost per capita of education for current 
expenses shows that for the year 1898-9, it was $18.76 in 
Lincoln, as compared with an average of $25.13, in five other 
cities having free text-books, and $22.63 m eighteen cities not 
supplying text-books free. 

The cost per capita for instruction was $14.96 in Lincoln, 
compared with $16.45, the average of twenty-four cities of like 
conditions. 

The total number of teachers employed during the year was 
167, of whom 15 were assistants to other teachers. There were 
123 regular teachers, 2 special teachers (music and drawing), 1 
night school teacher (for three months ) and 13 assistants in the 
grades, and 26 instructors and 2 assistants in the high school. 

The grade work has been materially strengthened by the 
introduction of a full year of kindergarten work below the first 
grade. This year will include strictly kindergarten work and in 
addition, work especially designed to prepare pupils for admis- </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

sion to the first grade. There are now fourteen fully equipped 
kindergartens in the Lincoln schools. 

The schools are graded on the half-year interval plan, except 
in the primary grades (i, 2, 3,) where there was introduced this 
year the twelve-week interval system. A modification of the 
half-year interval, permitting greater elasticity in the classification 
of the higher grades is also contemplated. 

The course of study was revised and published during the 
past year. One of the features of the new course is the concentration 
of general lessons comprising nature study, history, physiology, 
etc., so as to obviate the overcrowded program while, 
at the same time, securing a clearer definition of the work. The 
work in history has been more closely defined and unified as 
likewise that in language and geography. 

In the high school the range of elective work has been greatly 
extended, though each pupil's selection must be made under the 
personal direction and suggestion of the principal. No course 
in the curriculum is absolutely required in the sense that it may 
not give way to the peculiar circumstances, abilities and interests 
of the student. The work in science has been strengthened 
by the introduction of a thorough course in physical geography 
and a general laboratory course in elementary science in the 
first year. The latter is intended to serve as an introduction to 
scientific thought and laboratory methods, through simple 
experiments and studies involving fundamental principles and 
their application to the science of common things. No book 
will be used. 

In mathematics, algebra and geometry are taught upon alternate 
days from the beginning. 

In all the work of the high school emphasis is placed upon 
the correlation of one subject with another and the attempt is 
made to teach things in their relations. 

An experiment is being tried in the lower primary grades in 
the use of tables and chairs instead of the ordinary school desk. 
While it is too early to announce results, the experiment has 
already established the following propositions : </seg>

            <seg id="p334">
309 

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

i. That a room can be furnished with tables and chairs at 
about half the expense required of the ordinary school desk. 

2. That the restlessness characteristic of the ordinary primary 
school is greatly lessened, as a result of a more comfortable 
position. 

3. That a larger desk surface can be provided for each pupil 

4. That the teachers having the tables (three of them) are 
united in favor of the change. 

A rule passed by the board placing the sole power of selecting 
and nominating teachers in the grades in the hands of the 
superintendent, the selection in the high school to be by superintendent 
and principal jointly, marks a distinct advance in the 
administration of the schools. 

The tendency of this and other rules passed by the board is to 
raise the standard of qualifications for positions as teachers. By 
these rules the minimum of qualifications for a position as teacher 
in the schools was raised to the equivalent of a full four years' 
high school course and two years successful experience in public 
gradt-d schools, except in the case of college graduates, in which 
case one year's experience is accepted. Hereafter no teacher is to 
be employed in the high school who has not the equivalent of a 
college education, and one year's experience in teaching. The 
regulations governing the granting of certificates on examination 
were changed so as to require the candidates to pass the full 
examination at one time, while encouragement is offered to 
scholarship by accepting college standings on subjects covered 
by the examination for second and third grade certificates, and 
by exempting from examination those who have completed the 
equivalent of a college course. 

The teachers now on the force have shown an earnest desire 
for improvement. Many are availing themselves of the opportunities 
offered by the University to pursue studies which will 
prepare them for more efficient service in the schools, a practice 
which, under proper limitations, is worthy of cordial encouragement. 


As a body the teachers are capable, zealous and progressive. </seg>

MINDEN. 

Since our last report we have been favored with a new high 
school building. The first floor contains four schoolrooms, while 
the upper floor is used exclusively for high school purposes. 
The assembly room will accommodate with desks about 140 
students. Grouped around this there are two laboratories with 
a dark room; science recitation room; history and literature 
room; large mathematics room, and three small rooms for offices 
and library. Steam supplies the heat. </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

Our system of grading contemplates eight years work below 
the high school and four years therein. The course of study 
emphasizes the work in English, the elements of manual training 
and elementary science. The high school offers two courses, 
one prepares for the University, while the other offers more 
work in the common branches, and some suggestions for those 
who are preparing to teach. The majority of students take the 
preparatory course which contains more Latin and German. A 
strong sentiment, in favor of higher education is growing, and 
already a large colony of students from our school is found at 
the University. The work in history and literature is largely 
from the sources supplemented by a good reference library. 

Up to the present fifty-two non-resident students are enrolled. 

Patrons' meetings are organized and meet once each month 
with good attendance. We are shifting the punishment of pupils 
for misdemeanor from the teacher to the parent, and find it 
¦effectual and far more satisfactory than the old way. The parent 
receives word from the teacher when misconduct occurs, and 
deals with the child as he thinks best. There are few cases 
where the trouble is not remedied. In case it is not, the 
teacher must take the matter in hand. A. O. Thomas, 

Superintendent . 

MCCOOK. 

Fifteen teachers are employed in the McCook schools: three, 
including the superintendent, in the high school, and thirteen in 
the grades. In addition to these Mr. L.. W. Stayner, under the 
direction of the school authorities, conducts night classes in typewriting 
and stenography. 

We do twelve years' work, which does not include the time 
the child spends in the kindergarten before he enters the first 
primary. 

The last school census shows 908 children between the ages 
of five and twenty-one in the district, and 750 are enrolled in 
school. Accommodations are sadly over-crowed in McCook, 
the different grades being distributed in five separate buildings </seg>

in the city. While each teacher has a large average membership, 
she is, between the high school and second primary, in 
charge of but a single grade. Promotions are therefore made 
at the close of each semester. 

Good work is being established in the high school. We have 
well equipped laboratories for chemistry, botany and physics. 
The source study in history has passed the experimental stage, 
and in literature the Sherman method is in successful operation 
in the English classes of all four grades. Each pupil is- required 
to read yearly a stated number of standard works selected, 
under his teacher's guidance, from a well-chosen school library. 

The teachers, who are exceptionally able and energetic, carry 
on a course of professional study. Their hearty cooperation ir» 
all that pertains to the school's advancement is amply met by the 
strong school sentiment in the community at large.

Superintendent. 

NEBRASKA CITY. 

The past year has been a prosperous one for the Nebraska 
City public schools. The enrollment of a school is a matter of 
great importance for it shows to a great extent the aspect of the 
people toward the schools and at the same time is an indication 
of a city's increase or decrease in population. Along both these 
lines, Nebraska City is to be congratulated upon her showing. 
The school enrollment for 1900 (exclusive of transfers) was 
1,633, tne largest in the history of the school; larger by 245 
than in 1892, and eighty-six larger than in 1899. 

The teaching corps now numbers thirty-six, including the 
Superintendent; of these, seven are employed in the high school, 
twenty-six in the grades, and three in the kindergarten. 

In December, 1899, an important step was taken by the 
board when they established a kindergarten as a preliminary 
step to the first grade work. I consider it one of the most 
important branches of our school work. As it will save one to 
two years in the school life of the child, I believe it will prove a 
matter of economy in the end. That it has already taken hold </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

of the hearts of the people is evinced by the fact that in the 
brief period of its existence the enrollment has nearly reached 
an hundred.' The kindergarten is located at a central building 
and is in charge of a directress and two assistants. 

The schools of this city have been graded on the year interval. 
One of the greatest objections against this is that it does 
not provide for frequent adjustment of pupils, which is absolutely 
necessary, for the maturer and brighter children should 
not be held back for the slower and duller ones. This year, in 
all grades below the high school, semi-annual promotions in 
January will be made. At the same time, pupils may be promoted 
or demoted at any time the occasion may arise. 

The Nebraska City high school now offers three courses of 
study of four years each, namely : a Classical, Latin-Scientific 
and German-English. The latter course is quite popular with 
the students as it offers three years' work in the German 
language. It is the policy of the school to inspire a love for 
higher education and we think we can see results in that direction. 
The past year the high school has had graduates who 
carried off high honors at the University of Nebraska, Lake 
Forest University, Northwestern, Bellevue, Mt. Vernon Seminary 
and New York City Law School. 

Considerable attention is now given to rhetorical work in the 
high school. This has brought out the individuality of our 
pupils and has been, at least, the indirect means of their joining 
the Nebraska High School Debating association, becoming 
charter members of the Southeast Nebraska Debating association. 
The high school pupils conduct two local debating 
societies and publish a monthly paper, the Nebraska City 
Anchor. 

The aim of the board may be gathered from the words of the 
president, Dr. Claude Watson, in his recent annual report. "It 
has been the aim of the board to reduce expenses to the minimum 
so far as we could without detriment to the schools, yet 
our primary object has always been to maintain our present 
high standard, and we are assured by eminent State authority 
and by the history of many pupils who have attained meritorous </seg>

success after leaving our schools that our standard is of the 
highest and best. Upon all classes our schools wield a mighty 
influence for good. In the cases of many children it is the 
most helpful agency in moulding their lives. Too many of our 
children are surrounded by influences diversely opposed to inteh 
lectual development — too many fail to receive that refinement 
so badly needed. To these the school association is everything 
— when they are taught that these brighter realities of life, art, 
music and drawing, are within the reach of the humblest. The 
public school system leads the children of all classes on to a 

higher and nobler enjoyment of life and a wider field of useful

NORFOLK. 

The school population of Norfolk, school district as shown by 
the census of June, 1900, is 1,760. Of this number over 1,200 
are enrolled in the public schools, and about 200 in the German 
Lutheran parochial schools. As indicated in my report of 1898 
the demands for the labor of boys about the railroad shops and 
offices, and for the labor of boys and girls in the best fields 
retard entrance to the schools until late in the fall and cause an 
early withdrawal in the spring. 

The splendid weather which prevailed this year during the 
months of September, October and November offered an 
excellent opportunity for the employment of child labor and a 
consequent tardiness in entering school. However, as our citizens 
¦of foreign birth are fast acquiring a competence, and becoming 
familiar with the necessity and advantages of education, they are 
taking greater interest in the subject, and their children are 
rapidly becoming our best pupils. 

The most noticeable feature in our condition is the growth of 
our high school, which is 40 per cent greater than it was two 
years ago. 

During the past two years we have concentrated our attention 
upon fewer subjects of study, and are, we believe, reaping the 
fruits of improved work. Arithmetic, reading and spelling are </seg>

            <seg id="p341">

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS. 

subjects cultivated with especial care. In arithmetic the principles 
of the "spiral plan" are closely followed, and strongly 
supplemented by oral drill — mental arithmetic. In the lower 
grades two recitations each day are required in spelling. The 
first lesson is written, the second oral. In written work the 
pupils are required to divide words into their syllables and place 
the accent. In oral spelling the word is first pronounced, then 
each syllable is pronounced, and finally the whole word. The 
text book in spelling is supplemented by words taken from other 
texts in use, as history, geography, physiology, etc. 

In reading, while care is given to literary interpretation, particular 
attention is given to oral expression. This requires constant 
drill on the sounds of the characters, forms and qualities of voice. 

All our teachers, 27 at present writing, have had professional 
training, are cooperative in spirit, faithful and conscientious 
wotkers. 

Teachers' general meetings are held each Monday evening, 4 
to 6 o'clock. At these meetings, besides the discussion of particular 
topics, some work on pedagogy is systematically studied. 
Our teachers' meetings are a most valuable part of our system 
in cementing the combined ideas of our teachers as an educa- 

tional force. 

Three years ago we began the study of schoolroom decoration 
and sanitation. Most of our teachers and pupils also became 
much interested. As a result, flashy chromos and tawdry pictures 
of that kind rapidly disappeared, and splendid works of art have 
taken their place. 

On the whole, I am pleased to report a healthy condition of 
educational growth and spirit in our community. Much credit 
in this respect has been due to the conservative yet practical 
suggestions coming from the State Department during the past 
four years. D. C. O'Connor,

NORTH PLATTE. 

The public schools of the City of North Platte have the usual 

organization into twelve grades or years of work, the last four 

of which constitute the high school. The enrollment is about 

one thousand, of whom about one hundred and twenty are in the 

high school. There are employed at present twenty-one teach- 

ers, of whom all save two have been connected with the schools 

for more than two years. The attendance and punctuality are 

very commendable, all things considered. 

The school work during the past seven years has been very 

materially hampered by inadequate room, but this difficulty will 

bejobviated by the handsome new high school building now under 

construction, which will be ready for use January i, 1901. At that 

time we look forward to the enrichment of our high school 

course of study by the addition of mechanical drawing, German, 

trigonometry, and American history, which will place us on a 

level with the schools of other cities of this size. At the same 

we hope to make some changes in the lower grades which will 

give greater efficiency to the work there. C. E. Barber,

In the educational department, work has progressed without 
notable incident or excitement, and it is believed, with good 
success. 

An exhibit of certain features of the educational work was 
sent to the Paris Exposition just closed. Among them was an 
exhibit of the methods and illustrative materials used in the 
teaching of geography in the various grades. Upon this portion 
of the exhibit the schools were awarded a gold medal by the

Compared with the figures for 1890, the number of persons 
of school age (5 to 21) in the city in 1900 has increased 25 per

cent; the number in average daily attendance has increased 61 
per cent. Carroll G. Pearsh,

PLATTSMOUTH. 

During the past few years the schools of Plattsmouth have 
made exceptional progress. The high school department has 
grown from 70 pupils to an enrollment at present of 208, and a 
new high school building has been built for the high school 
department exclusively. Four of the five teachers in that department 
are graduates of the State University, each teacher having 
one line of work, for which she has specially prepared. The 
new high school building has a capacity of 240, and contains one 
of the most completely fitted chemical and physical laboratories 
in the State. Three of the class or recitation rooms are arranged 
with rolling partitions so that they may be thrown into the main 
assembly room, making a fine auditorium for general exercises, 
or entertainments. The building is all on the ground floor, 
and is lighted with both gas and electric lights. A full 
line of reference books supplementing the texts have been 
recently added for each subject. A full line of slides for the 
magic lantern, illustrating botany, zoology, physiology, geology, 
and astronomy, are being purchased, from 60 to 100 slides for </seg>

each, and a number of compound microscopes will be added during 
the year to those already on hand. The high school fits the 
pupils for every department at the State University, for the 
regular freshman work. 

The attendance in the grades is very much larger than at any 
time in the history of the schools. During the last few years, 
the aim of the management has been lo intensify the work in the 
common branches, and produce as great a degree of thoroughness 
and strength in the grades as possible. 

The graduating class of 1901 numbers 36, and one of the 
most gratifying features of this year is that 17, or nearly 48 per 
cent are boys. 

Another gratifying showing is that about 17 per cent of the 
total number of pupils enrolled in the city, are in the high school 
department. The cost of education per pupil enrolled is exceptionally 
low, being less than $12.00 per pupil.

SCHUYLER 

The school system of Schuyler follows the political division of 
the city. A four-room building is in the North ward, a threeroom 
house in the East ward, while in the eastern part of the 
West ward, and therefore near the center of the city, is the 
$30,000 high school building, one of the best arranged, best 
heated and ventilated buildings in the State, as well as one of the 
most beauttful. The school is complete in every detail, with 
progressive work in each branch. Promotions occur semiannually, 
and a class enters the high school in January as well as 
September. 

Under the supervision of G. F. Burkett the schools were 
graded somewhat higher in arithmetic than other schools of the 
State. Spelling also has been given special attention. This 
year a music supervisor is employed, and other branches are 
being strengthened. The school is supplied with a good scientific

and a uniformed athletic company among the girls. Each 
organization numbers about forty. Two debating societies are 
also working in the high school. In the West ward building, 
pupil self-government is being introduced, but it is too early to 
judge of results. The schools employ 16 teachers, including the 
superintendent. The average salary of teachers, excluding the 
superintendent, is $50 per month. The district treasury at the 
end of last year contained a surplus of over $6,000. 

The high school is an accredited school of the University 
under Class B. E. B. Sherman, 

Superintendent . 

SKWARD. 

The work in the city schools for the past two years has 
been one of continual improvement. 

No effort has been spared to make the schools grow in moral 
and intellectual attainments. A full treasury has been at our 
disposal and good use has been made of the money. 

Our people are loyal and believe in their schools. They hare 
-elected capable men as members of the board of education and 
appreciate the work of teachers by paying them good salaries. 

Our course of study covers twelve complete grades. There 
is but one course in the high school, and that what would be 
termed an English course. In addition to this, Latin may be 
elected in place of equivalent work in English for the last two 
years. 

Our high school teachers, three in number, are college graduates. 
The whole corps of teachers number thirteen — all being 
well fitted for their respective work. 

Our high school library has made considerable growth in the 
two years past, adding a new International cyclopaedia, Standard 
•dictionary, reference books on history, science and elocution. 

Our work in science has been much improved by additional 
apparatus and good teaching. Our laboratory facilities, while 
not the best, are «sed in such a w?y as to bring the very best 
possible returns. 

We are in need of better and more commodious buildings and </seg>

we hope the time is near at hand when the city will vote a new 
building. 

Our schools are behind in music and drawing, but a start has 
been made in these lines and very gratifying results already 
appear. Considerable progress has been made in the study of 
pictures. The lives of the pupils have been brightened and 
enlarged because of the presence. of good pictures. An Art 
club has been organized recently in connection with the State 
organisation for the special purpose of stimulating interest in the 
beautiful and to assist the schools in securing special advantages 
in the use and ownership of many reproductions from the 
masters. 

With much encouragement and high aspirations, we are pushing 
forward for the goal of high attainment. 

W. W. Stonkr, 

Superintendent. 

TECUMSEH. 

The schools at Tecumseh are housed in four buildings — three 
frame, and one brick and stone. Eleven teachers are employed, 
three of whom conduct the high school. The total enrollment 
at present is 525. Of these 262 are in the primary school, 153 
in the grammar school, and no in the high school. We have 
35 non-resident pupils, 34 of whom are in the high school. A 
number of non-resident pupils who had planned to enter the 
high school this year, have been compelled to remain at home on 
account of the Free Attendance Law being declared unconstitutional. 


The greatest changes in the grades have been : ( 1 ) the introduction 
of the vertical system of penmanship; (2) an enthusiastic 
interest in drawing and art; (3) an awakening to the 
possibilities and value of Nature work; and, (4) a revised course 
in language and grammar, based largely on the course presented 
to the Association of Superintendents and Principals last year. 

In the high school, recognizing the demands of the times for 
better prepared students for every day business life, more attention 
and time is given to bookkeeping and the subjects of busi- 

22 </seg>

            <seg id="p349">
322 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

ness arithmetic, commercial law and economics have been added 
to the course. 

So many high school graduates become school teachers that it 
was thought advisable to offer a review in the twelfth grade of 
the common branches for the benefit of these students. These 
subjects are made elective, (as are all twelfth grade subjects,) 
and are being well patronized. 

The need of better library and laboratory facilities is recognized, 
and these departments are being improved as finances 
permit. This year quite a number of books have been added to 
the library, and some chemical apparatus, and a fine high grade 
compound microscope were purchased for the laboratory. 

We believe in rhetoricals and graduating exercises, consisiing 
of orations delivered by the graduates, and find a hearty 
endorsement of these views by both students and patrons. 

The school enjoys the interest and support of the people, and 
its constant improvement is the anxious care of the board of 
education. C. N. Anderson, 

Su-perinlendent. 

TEKAMAH. 

The Tekamah schools are now located under one roof, the 
modern ten-room building having been completed during the 
summer, and opened with appropriate exercises in August. The 
new building is the result of a series of teachers' and patrons' 
meetings held a few years ago. As a result of the sentiment 
created by these meetings, an extra year was added to the high 
school course, and we now have a complete four-year course,, 
which satisfies the demand for practical studies, as well as lifting 
the school to a higher plane from the University standpoint. 

Nine teachers are employed. For the sake of economy the 
board of education decided to run the schools for a year without 
a superintendent, assigning some of the duties of the superintendent 
to the high school principal. 

The enrollment in September was 439, of which 60 were in 
the high school. Five boys and one girl will graduate next May

WYMORE. 

The 1900 census gave Wymore's population as 2,626. Her 
last school census was 896. The school enrollment last year 
was 765, of whom eighty-eight were in the high school. The 
enrollment of this year will be larger, that of the high school 
being already ninety-one. Sixteen teachers are employed, but 
there should be eighteen. The present board of education, 
which consists of six of the most select and best qualified men of 
the city, insist that the expenditures shall not exceed the receipts 
longer, and find that, consequently the employment of more 
teachers would be impracticable. One of our teachers teaches 
two schools, having each for a half-day session. 

We have three school buildings, all of the most substantial 
material and construction. The Central school, where the high 
school is located, is a very large building, requiring twelve 
teachers, and accommodating little less than 600 pupils. 

The high school occupies five rooms, one of which is the 
library, or reading room, the other the laboratory. The library 
is quite well equipped with reference books for all subjects 
taught, as well as a large collection of books for general reading, 
and a large number of magazines. This reading room is in 
charge of a student of the high school, and all students have the 
privilege of working there so long as the privilege is not abused. 
The laboratory is large and exceptionally well equipped for 
work in chemistry, physics, and botany, and consequently, our 
work in science is especially strong. The high school has a 
single course of study, affording only the minimum amount of 
work for a four-year course; but the subjects taught are only 
those which have been approved as of the highest value, and 
they are all given sufficient time for thorough treatment. Our 
course of study articulates closely with the freshman class of the 
State University. 

Our course of study below the high school covers eight years' 
work, and comprises reading, writing, spelling, drawing, language 
and composition, arithmetic, geography, English grammar, U.S. 
history, physiology, and a half-year course in civil government. </seg>

STATE BUPERINTENDE.NT'8 REPORT. 

Besides these, a strong course is given in "Observation and 
General Lessons," running throughout the eight years, and seeking 
to inculcate habits of observation and general inquiry, and to 
impart broad general information of the many things in the common 
environment. 

Wymore being essentially a railroad town, many children 
come and go within each school year; but the interest in education 
is strong, and the attendance in the high school is large and 
growing rapidly. The public is never lacking in support of or 
interest in the schools. 

If we have any special feature this year, it is the outdoor 
games of the children, which we are utilizing for educational 
good. All the games are under the direction of the teacher, 
and each teacher has her own school to itself. So far, it seems 
to be a real success, and satisfactory to all concerned.

THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA. 

The past biennial has been characterized by the same external 
and internal growth that the University has enjoyed for the 
decade preceding. In the headship of the University an interregnum 
of one year has existed, Dean Bessey acting as Chancellor 
from Chancellor McLean's resignation in August, 1899, 
until Chancellor Andrews assumed the duties of the office in 
August, 1900. Notwithstanding this period of suspense no halt, 
no deterioration has occurred. The opening of the present year 
found all parts of the administration in the best of order, and all 
departments of instruction prosperous. 

The most signal note of University prosperity is the law passed 
by the last Legislature granting a one mill levy on the great 
assessment roll, instead of a three-eighths mill levy. From all 
sources the University the past biennium has received $496,000 
as against $302,000 for the previous biennium, and $340,145 for 
the two years, 1895-6. The new law did not go into operation 
until January 1, 1900. Consequently its full value has as yet 
scarcely been felt. Nevertheless, new buildings have been erected 
and permanent improvements been made both on the University 
campus and at the University farm. 

On the campus the University Soldiers' Memorial hall has 
been completed. This is an addition to the west end of Grant 
Memorial hall. It contains besides class rooms in the basement, 
a large auditorium with a seating capacity of 1,200. The handsome 
pipe organ recently given to the University by its alumni, 
has been placed in this hall. It is planned that ultimately Grant 
Memorial hall and University Soldiers' Memorial hall, will be 
used entirely by the military and physical training departments, 
but this cannot come to pass until a "University Auditorium" is 
provided by the Legislature. 

An addition of forty feet in length has been placed on the west </seg>

            <seg id="p354">

326 

end of the boiler house, a new chimney has been built, andQtwo 
new boilers of 150 horse power each have been added to the 
power plant. This new equipment will supply the campus buildings 
with ample steam heating and power for several years at 
least. 

It may be mentioned incidentally that the interior of mechanic 
arts hall and of the foundry have been improved, the campus 
has been beautified by the constant care of a gardener, new 
walks have been laid, and clocks have been placed in the main 
corridors of all halls. Just south of library hall a Spanish war 
cannon, donated by the Government to the City of Lincoln, has 
been mounted upon a pedestal, and stands as a memorial of the 
late war. Plans now exist for erecting a memorial to Colonel 
Stotsenburg, who met his death in the Philippines. The wind, 
rain and electrical storm of August 21 did considerable damage 
to the grounds and buildings, blowing in windows, tearing off 
parts of the roof of University hall, and ruining several valuable 
trees. It is fortunate that the loss was not greater, for the wind 
was of hurricane velocity, seventy-six miles an hour, and the 
University was in the path of its greatest velocity. 

At the State farm the new experiment station building has 
been erected at a cost of about $25,000. This building furnishes 
accommodations for the experiment station staff, and will also 
furnish temporary quarters for the agricultural school. A steam 
heating and power plant has been erected near by, and a system 
of boiler works installed, furnishing ample supply for the buildings, 
also fire protection, and for the needs of the feed yards and 
barns. These latter improvements cost $10,000. 

The University has increased its equipment in many ways. 
The general library now numbers 48,000 volumes, an increase 
of 10,000 volumes during the biennium. Its greatest growth 
has been in the departmental libraries, which now number eleven, 
with a seating capacity of 250. The general reading room 
has been enlarged, now seating 300 students. The Dewey Decimal 
system is complete in the entire library and its departments. 
By the publication of bulletins and by cooperation with other </seg>

STATE SCHOOLS. 

libraries in the State, the University library is extending its 
influence with remarkably useful results. 

The University's museum outfit has grown steadily both in 
museum proper and the departmental museums, having received 
rich accessions. Departments draw upon the museum for 
material used in illustrating and in other methods of instruction. 
Many of the collections have been donated to the museum by 
private parties. Chief among these are the geological collections 
from Regent Charles H. Morrill, and the archaelogical 
collections of 4,000 Indian relics from different States, donated 
by Dr. M. H. Everett, of Lincoln. The University is under the 
greatest obligation to both these gentlemen. Perhaps the Agiicultural 
museum has enjoyed the most remarkable growth of 
all. This now illustrates the forestry of the State as represented 
by timbers, shrubs and insects injurious to vegetables. It possesses 
complete specimen sets of grains, fruits, grasses and soils. 
The State Board of Agriculture takes an active interest in this 
department of the museum and is doing much among the farmers 
of the State to promote its value. 

The Historical Society's rooms in the basement of Library 
Hall are now completely filled. Almost every available inch of 
spice that existed two years ago has been utilized. As a result 
of its activity the society possesses many valuable collections, 
and its files of State newspapers are recognized as of great 
practical and historical worth. 

The Herbarium has grown until at present it contains 100,000 
specimens, and is in itself large enough to take rank as a distinct 
part of the University. 

A marked advance in the number and quality of University 
publications is apparent, especially in such as relate to the 
administrative offices of the University and to the Experiment 
Station. Another number of the University Studies has been 
published. The Graduate Club has issued its first Graduate 
Mag zine and several publications have appeared in print from 
certain classes of the alumni association. 

Still further advantages await the students and the University 
in the women's parlor and rest-room recently furnished, in bet- </seg>

ter facilities against fire protection and in the fund for the care 
of the sick. This fund, it is hoped, is a mucleus from which 
will grow a University infirmary. 

A University station of the post-office for the regular distribution 
and the handling of the mail by government officials has 
been applied for and will probably be established in the near 
future. It is hoped that a direct street car line to the University 
farm will soon bring the agricultural work into closer connection 
with the University. 

In widening the influence of the University the inspection of 
high schools has accomplished much more than ever before, for 
this inspection has gradually been applied to nearly all high 
schools in Nebraska and many in the tributary territory outside 
of the State, and through the cooperation of county superintendents, 
even to rural and village schools. 

The extension spirit has developed along many other broad 
lines. Fifty-one farmers' institutes were held last winter, covering 
all parts of Nebraska. The professors in the industrial college 
were the main workers, and these institutes were a potent 
factor in bringing the work of the college before many rural 
districts. Many lecturers and workers not connected with the 
University, some of national promise, were secured. Institutes 
for this year have been planned on a much larger scale, from 
which correspondingly larger results are anticipated. 

The University has continued and enlarged its work for the 
teachers. The summer sessions for teachers have been well 
attended and productive of results. The committee on appointment 
of University graduates to positions now includes all heads 
of departments. The success and prominence of this appointment 
committee is recognized by the constant demand upon it 
for recommendations by school boards. Within four years ioi 
teachers' certificates have been issued to graduates of the 
University taking their degrees of A. B. or B. Sc. t which signify 
that these students have completed the requirements for the 
University teachers' course. Thus the University is taking the 
students from the schools of the State and returning them to the 
schools thoroughly trained in discernment and judgment. The </seg>

STATE SCHOOLS. 

University is not only the head of the system, but in a way the 
center, its usefulness radiating outward. More and more all 
educational interests are gathered about it. The various State 
societies are eager to accept the freedom of the University in 
holding their annual meetings. During the holidays hundreds of 
teachers attending the meeting of the State Teachers' association 
are upon the ground. At other times the State Board of 
Agriculture, Horticulture, State Dairymen's and Improved Stock 
Breeders' associations are welcome guests of the University. 

The sociological opportunity for extension work was recognized 
some years ago, but it has been only during the past 
biennium that its opportunities have been fully grasped, and that 
it has found expression in the work of the College Settlement, 
and the Association of Associated Charities. 

Reviewing the two years, then, the spirit has been eminently 
that of growth and of steady progress. Financially, the commonwealth 
of Nebraska has liberally recognized the needs of the 
institution. In buildings and equipment, and improvements the 
University has added to its efficacy. In attendance it has enjoyed 
more than a natural increase. Internally the evolution has been 
along the broad and natural lines of the true and real University. 
And finally, it has widened its sphere of influence, reaching out 
to. the remotest occupations with its practical help, yet at the 
same time maintaining the highest ideals of scholarship and culture.

grades of the school system. In all the regular courses the University 
crowns the work begun in the grades and continued in 
the high schools. 

Practically the institution opens its doors to all the sons and </seg>

daughters of the State and to all students wherever their homes,, 
without discrimination. The broad and hospitable spirit of a 
genuine university is seen in its foundation and in its endeavors 
and its work. 

ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT. 

The University of Nebraska was originally founded by an Act 
of the Legislature entitled "An Act to establish the University 
of Nebraska," which took effect February 15, 1869. 

Upon the adoption of the new Constitution of the State in 
1875, which recognized the University as already having corporate 
existence, some important changes were introduced. Section 
10, of Article 8, entitled "Education," Constitution of 1875^ 
provides as follows : 

"Section 10. The general government of the University of 
Nebraska shall, under direction of the Legislature, be vested in 
a board of six regents, to be styled the Board of Regents of the 
University of Nebraska, who shall be elected by the electors of 
the State at large, and their terms of office, except those chosen 
at the first election as hereinafter provided, shall be six years. 
Their duties and powers shall be prescribed by law, and they 
shall receive no compensation, but may be reimbursed their 
actual expenses incurred in the discharge of their duties." 

The Legislature first convening after the adoption of the new 
constitution of 1875, namely in 1877, remodeled the act of 1869^ 
making amendments to several sections thereof and conforming 
it to the new constitution, and consolidating in one act the amendments 
made to the law from time to time from 1867 to 1877. 
This amended and consolidated statute is the one giving ihe 
present organization to the University, and appears as chapter 
87, compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1897, sections 5203 to 5244 
inclusive. 

REVENUES. 

By amendment of the original act of 1869, a tax is provided 
for the support of the University of three-eighths of a mill per 
dollar uppn the grand assessment roll of the State. To be added 
to this are, income from land leases and sales under the Land </seg>

            <seg id="p361">

STATK SCHOOLS. 

-Grant Act of Congress of 1862, for the benefit of the Industrial 
-College, and under the Enabling Act reserving seventy-two sections 
of land for the State University; also the money grant by 
the Act of Congress of August, 1890, commonly known as the 
"Morrill Fund" Act, and the Agricultural Experiment Station 
Act of 1887. The total annual aggregate approximately of revenue 
from these several sources, and including fet, is $130,000. 

LANDS. 

By the Act of Congress of July 2, 1862, the Industrial College 
of the University became possessed of 90,000 acres of land ; by 
the Enabling Act, admitting the State into the Union, seventy-two 
sections of land were reserved for the endowment of the University; 
making a total of 136,080 acres of endowment lands. 
These lands were located by a special commissioner and confirmed 
to the State. Provision is made by law for the leasing of 
the lands along with common school lands, by the Board of 
Public Lands and Buildings. The interest arising from leases 
and upon sale contracts is paid into the temporary University 
fund, with taxes and other moneys intended for current use. 
The principal accruing from former sales is paid into the permanent 
endowment fund, to be invested in securities, the interest 
only of which can be used for maintenance. Under an Act of 
the Legislature of 1897, no further sales of these lands can be 
made, but the lands may be leased as before. There are between 
15,000 and 20,000 acres yet unsold. 

COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS 

The University of Nebraska comprises the following named 
colleges and schools:

The School of Domestic Science. 

Special Professional Courses. 

The Summer Session. 

The regents of the University have also entrusted to their 
charge the United States Experiment Station. They offer 
courses in University extension, including farmers' institutes. 

There is also affiliated with the University a school of music 
in which, pending the opening of the College of Fine Arts, 
instruction is given in every grade of instrumental and vocal 
music, and in drawing, painting, wood carving, modeling, etching, 
and the history of art. 

Pending the establishment of a geological and natural history 
survey and the development of other boards by the State, members 
of the University faculty are, by appointment of the Governor 
and Legislature, acting State botanist, acting State chemist, 
acting State entomologist, acting State geologist, acting Stale 
veterinarian. 

Thk Graduate School. — In each of the colleges there are 
advanced courses of study leading to advanced degrees. These 
courses are open to graduates of any college upon the presentation 
of their diplomas, providing the administrating council of 
the school is satisfied that they are prepared to enter upon work. 

The College of Literature, Science, and the Arts offers classical 
and literary instruction leading to the degree of Bachelor of 
Arts. These courses cover four years of residence work. 

The Industrial College contains the general and special groups 
of studies in science, agriculture, and engineering leading to the 
degree of Bachelor of Science. These courses cover four years 
of residence work. 

The College of Law offers a two-years' course of instruction 
leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws. 

The School of Agriculture is a secondary school, training 
primarily for practical farm life. There is a short course of 
eleven weeks alternating with a long course of three years of 
thirty-four weeks each, for three successive years. This course 
prepares for the agricultural group in the Industrial College. 

The School of Mechanic Arts is a secondary school training </seg>

in the principles of practical mechanics. It has a two-years* 
course. 

The School of Domestic Science is a secondary school, training 
in the principles of household economics. 

The special courses in medicine and in law and journalism are 
short courses intended to be preparatory to the advanced courses 
of the professional schools. The teachers' course is an advanced 
course, and, in fact, the beginning of a professional school. 

The Summer School is primarily for teachers. A six weeks' 
course of instruction is offered in various University subjects for 
those whose school duties prevent them from taking a regular 
University course. 

The experiment station is for investigation of agricultural 
questions, and the diffusion of knowledge in this field by means 
of the publication of bulletins. 

University extension, including farmers' institutes, is a means 
for adult education beyond the bounds of the University. 

GROUNDS AND BUILDINGS. 

The campus of the University faces R street with the main 
entrance commanding Eleventh street. The location is a central 
one and is easily accessible from all the railway stations. 

The following buildings are located upon the campus: 

University Hall, located at the center of the campus. This 
building contains the administrative offices, the chapel, the open

wing is designed for use in giving enlarged accommodations for 
the Military department and also as a women's gymnasium, but 
for a time will provide a temporary auditorium and chapel with 
a seating capacity of 1,500. Ultimately Grant Memorial and 
University Soldiers' Memorial Halls will be used entirely by the 
Military and Physical Training departments. Temporarily, 
Soldiers' Memorial Hall will contain the large pipe organ 
recently given to the University by the alumni of the institution 
until an "Auditorium" is provided. 

Nebraska Hall contains the museum of the natural and physical 
sciences, the United States weather bureau, and the State 
climate and crop service, and the lecture rooms, libraries, and 
laboratories of the Departments of Botany, Geology, Horticulture, 
Meteorology, Physics, and Zoology. 

The Plant House, located near Nebraska Hall, is a part of the 
Departments of Horticulture and Botany and furnishes plants for 
experimental purposes. Extensive greenhouses are at the State 
Farm for the use of these departments. 

The Electrical Laboratory and Shop contain the engines and 
dynamos of four distinct and complete electrical systems and 
other electrical apparatus, as well as the forges, lathes, etc., of 
the School of Mechanic Arts. 

The Boiler House supplies the heat to all the buildings of the 
campus, as well as steam power for the engines and dynamos of 
the electrical plant. At present it is being enlarged and a new 
chimney added, so that its capacity will be doubled. 

The Library Building contains the books and collections of 
the Nebraska Historical Society, the large reading room accommodating 
300 readers, seminar, cataloguing and book-stack 
rooms, the Art Gallery, and the rooms of the Departments of 
Philosophy, Pedagogy, English Literature, History, and Political 
and Economic Science.

and connected with it by electric cars. Here is located the 
Experiment Station Building, which provides laboratories for 
Horticulture, Agricultural-Chemistry, Soil Analysis, Botany, and 
Entomology; offices, library, reading room, and class rooms. 
Being the first permanent building in the agricultural group, it 
has been very carefully designed with a view to the future 
growth and needs of the School of Agriculture and United 
States Experiment Station. On the farm also are located the 
patho-biological laboratory, the animal house, the agriculturalchemical 
laboratory, the dairy hall and creamery, and the farm 
house, the Experiment Station barn, machinery and animal sheds, 
etc. A new heating and pumping plant has just been erected. 

A cannon captured in the Spanish-American war and presented 
to the City of Lincoln by the United States government, has been 
placed upon the campus just south of library hall. 

A bulletin showing views of the University campus, the State 
farm and the various halls will be sent free upon application to 
the University publisher.

THE UNITED STATES AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION. 

The United States Agricultural Experiment Station, which is 

carried on in connection with The University of Nebraska, is 

maintained from a fund appropriated by the national Congress. 

In 1887 a bill was introduced into Congress, which has become 

known, from the name of its introducer, as the "Hatch Bill." 

Under the provisions of this bill it was proposed to offer to each 

State and Territory sufficient funds to establish an agricultural 

experiment station in each, in connection with the Agricultural 

college which might already have been established under the 

Act of 1862 donating land for such colleges. 

Nebraska, through her Legislature, as provided by the law 

making possible the establishing of the stations, assented to the 

conditions imposed, which were very simple, and was one of the 

States to receive immediate benefits from the Act.

Five hundred periodicals are received, including thirty local 
State papers, which are generously donated by the publishers. 
The reading room of the main library seats 300, and the depart- 

mental library reading rooms seat 250. 

All the libraries are open for reference to any one, whether 

connected with the University or not. 

Reference work, for teachers and students through the State 

will cheerfully be done by correspondence. 

The University library is always glad to render any help pos- 

sible to other libraries in Nebraska, in book selection, purchase 
of fittings, suggestions for cataloging and administration,especiall y 

to the libraries of high schools. 

1 he State Library is in the Capitol. It is one of the strongest 

law libraries in the country. It contains some valuable periodical 
sets, supplementing the University collection, and a good collec- 

tion of economic literature. It opens from 8:30 a. m. to 5 p. m. 
The library of the State Historical Society receives regularly 

all newspapers published in the State, and has a valuable collec- 

tion of State newspaper filee. 

The Lincoln City Library is free to students, both for refer- 

ence and lending. Its hours are 9 a. m. to 10 p. m., and it is 

open Sundays from 2 to 10 p. m. 

A short introductory course of lectures on the use of the 

library is given to the entering class at the opening of the year. 
This covers a description of the University library and other 
libraries in the vicinity; the arrangement of the books, use of the 
catalogue, indexes and reference books, methods of reading and 
research, especially as related to University studies. Personal </seg>

assistance and suggestion upon all matters relating to the use of 
the library will be cheerfully given at all times by the librarian 
or assistants. 

A course of forty lectures with laboratory work in library 
science and bibliography will be given by the librarian to not less 
than six students showing adequate preparation. Credit will be 
given, and in filling vacancies on the library staff preference will 
be given to those showing most fitness and ability, who have 
taken this work. For particulars regarding this work see section 
library under undergraduate courses of instruction. 

MUSEUMS. 

The State Museum occupies the second and third floors of the 
east wing of Nebraska Hall. The museum proper is supplemented 
by important departmental museums, such as those of 
Botany and Horticulture, Zoology, Entomology, Pathology, 
Chemistry, Mechanic Arts, the Classical, Literary, and Historical 
departments, the Library and the State Historical Society, 
the last named being a large and important museum in itself, 
occupying fire-proof apartments in the Library Hall. The State 
Museum is already sufficiently well stocked, so that it is now 
drawn upon by all departments for illustrative and instructional 
material. Important additions made annually both by purchase 
and by donation. 

The geological collections consist chiefly of well systematized 
sets of minerals, crystals, rocks, rock sections, ores and fossils 
for class use. Some of these sets are large and very complete 
and represent foreign as well as American material. Conspicuous 
among the geological collections are the donations of Regent 
Charles H. Morrill, of Lincoln. This one collection, chiefly 
paleontological, occupies most of the space on the main floor 
of the museum. Besides there are many miscellaneous sets 
collected and donated by citizens of the State. 

The zoological collection consists of fresh water, marine, and 
land forms in general, with special collections of insects, birds, 
reptiles, fishes, and certain mammals of the State and elsewhere, </seg>

STATE SCHOOLS. 

together with numerous osteological and anatomical preparations 
for class use and for the instruction of the public. 

The Agricultural Museum is rapidly becoming an important 
feature of the State Museum. This now comprises the forestry 
of the State as represented by timbers, shrubs, and vines, and 
also by forestry photographs, the insects injurious and beneficial 
to vegetation, the woods, grains, grasses, and fruits of the State, 
together with a very complete soil collection, with analyses of 
the same. 

Important additions have lately come to the Agricultural 
Museum through the State Board of Agriculture. In the 
Archaeological collections the most important single contribution 
is that of some 4,000 Indian relics from the various States, 
donated by Dr. M. H. Everett, of Lincoln, Nebraska. 

The Departmental Museums are to be found in rooms adjoining 
or close to the departments concerned. 

THE UNIVERSITY HERBARIUM 

The University Herbarium fills room no, Nebraska Hall, 
and contains about 90,000 mounted specimens of plants, representing 
the North American and European floras. Included 
with the University Herbarium is the "Survey Herbarium" of 
¦about 10,000 mounted specimens of Nebraska plants. 

THE BOTANICAL AND GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS. 

The Botanical Survey of Nebraska was undertaken by the 
Botanical Seminar of the University in 1892, since which time 
work has been done in the field each season, and four "Reports" 
and three parts of "The Flora of Nebraska" have been published. 
The early publication of a "Descriptive Catalogue of 
the Plants of Nebraska" is announced, and a fifth "Report" will 
go to press soon. 

The Geological Survey was begun in June of 1899, or l^ e 
purpose of studying, and as soon as possible reporting upon the 
important economic resources, such as stone, clay, gravel, sand, 
coal, ochre, abrasives, etc., and upon the water resources of the 
State. </seg>

EXPENSES. 

The average cost of a year's attendance at the University is 

about $250. Many students spend much less than this. Board 

and lodging may be found among families of the city. The Y. 

M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. make a canvass of the city in Sep- 

tember and have on file a list of rooms and boarding places. 

These associations render invaluable assistance to new students 

in locating for the year. The Y. M. C. A. also maintains an 

employment bureau which is of great help to students who are 

obliged to partially support themselves at the University. The 

University guarantees no employment to any students, but there 

are many opportunities for work in a city the size of Lincoln. 

It is advised that no student enter the University unless he has- 

resources for at least one semester's work, that is, $125.

STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 

The Nebraska State Normal School has grown steadily in 

attendance and character of work during the past two years. 

The enrollment at present is the largest in the history of the 

school, and the daily correspondence with young men and 

women in all parts of the State gives promise of continued 

increase in numbers. The school is rapidly coming into its own 

— that is, is being recognized as the professional head of our 

public school system, having vital relations to the work in the 

common schools in every county of the State. County Super- 

intendents are recognizing in the school an institution to which 

they can direct young men and women for preparation for their 

work as teachers. They also find in the student body a supply 

of trained workers to meet their needs, as is evidenced by their 

many requests for teachers. This growth of the school it a </seg>

state' superintendent's report. 

healthy growth, due to its adaptation to present conditions in the 
State. The faculty are ambitious to have at Peru the best 
Normal school of the United Stales, and are earnestly studying 
the whole Normal school problem anew. They are seeking to 
discover what training will best prepare the young men and 
women of Nebraska for efficient service in her public schools, 
and are endeavoring to provide such in the curriculum and methods 
of the school. As this fact becomes more generally known 
throughout the State, the present rapid growth will be much 
augmented. 

An important change was made in the professional work at 
the beginning of the present year. Hitherto "practice teaching" 
has been engaged in by students in both the "higher" and 
the "lower course" — that is, both seniors completing the full 
course of study and "trainers" seeking the two-years' license to 
teach have engaged in apprentice teaching during a part of the 
year. Now only the seniors in the full course are permitted to 
teach in the Model school, and they teach under close supervision 
.throughout the entire year. The trainers observe model 
teaching by an experienced teacher of the regular faculty, seeking 
to interpret and appreciate the general conception and details of 
method in each recitation. The students meet the Model 
teacher to report the results of their observation and for critical 
guidance in this clinic study of good school methods. This 
change in general plan of professional study in the Training class 
has proved most satisfactory, both as regards the pupils, teachers 
and the children in the Model school. Relieving the Model 
school from the "practice teaching" of this large class of immature 
students and substituting for such work true artistic teaching 
by a strong professional teacher, has transformed an 
indifferent "practice school" into a first-class public school. Also 
changing the necessary bungling "teaching" by novitiates into 
an interpretative study of the work of a master has created a 
new professional attitude toward the business for which these 
young people are preparing that is already bearing rich fruit and 
promises much for their future usefulness. Every exercise of 
the Normal school, whether in the Model school or in the class- </seg>

STATE SCHOOLS. 

rooms of higher academic study, presents itself in a new light; 
all the teaching of the school is now seen to be a rationalized 
endeavor to guide into fuller life. 

An important result of this change has been in the additional 
opportunity for closely guided work by the Seniors. In order to 
provide a place for teaching by the trainers it was formerly 
necessary to limit the teaching by the Seniors to a few weeks of 
the year; now each senior teaches throughout the year. This 
prolonged study under critical sympathetic guidance gives a 
practical knowledge of school aims and procedure. 

The present faculty of the State Normal School have entered 
heartily into all plans for improving the character of the work. 
Not only is each teacher enthusiastic in his efforts to do better 
work in his special subject, but all unite heartily in promoting 
the general welfare of the whole work. Each one seeks to 
know the general aim and method of the school and to adapt 
his special views and activities to such ends. It is a school in 
which it is felt that the best work for each teacher is secured 
by promoting the good of the whole body, and in which it is 
recognized that the general result in the whole is improved by 
improving the work of each teacher in his own classroom. 

It is evident to all who know the conditions in the State Normal 
School that the work is seriously cramped and hindered by 
lack of adequate material equipment. The School, though in 
general capable of indefinite expansion to meet the needs of our 
growing State, has in some directions reached the limits of its 
growth until additional provisions are made by the appropriation 
of funds. The chapel is daily crowded to its utmost capacity 
; and the library building has long been inadequate for the 
demands of the school. The insistent question with all who 
know the school is, "Is Nebraska ready to satisfy the reasonble 
claims of the school for adequate equipment for its important 
work?" If the State will do for its Normal School what it has 
so generously done for its State University, the result will be 
the same as in the case of the University. Its University ranks 
among the best in America, and with proper equipment its Normal 
School will take equally high rank. To render the present</seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

investment more productive, additional buildings must be provided. 
A library building is demanded not only to house 
properly the large and rapidly growing library, but also to 
secure this valuable collection of books against loss by fire. 
The library consists of 15,000 volumes of carefully selected 
books, a normal school library not surpassed by that of any 
normal school in America. Many of these books are rendered 
difficult of access by lack of proper shelf-room. The present 
reading-room is much too small to provide accommodation for 
those making daily use of the books; and work in all classes is 
hindered by the congestion of the student body in the library. 
This valuable library is in a small frame building without insurance; 
it is simply a matter of good business management to provide 
a proper home for it. It is an imperative necessity to 
build a fire-proof library building. 

With a new Chapel building seating 1,500 students, the school 
would be able to care for its attendance for some years to come. 
Such a Chapel can be built with a large gymnasium basement, 
thus providing for the physicial training so long neglected in the 
school. The rooms released for other uses by these two buildings 
would provide amply for the indicated growth of the school. 
The Model school, now occupying rooms in the general building, 
could be much better housed in the present library building; 
and the present Chapel would add three good classrooms 
to those at present available. The State needs, in order to 
properly equip its Normal school, to provide through its coming 
Legislature for two more good modern buildings at Peru. 

The question of the establishment of additional Normal 
schools at other points in the State is not necessarily involved in 
the consideration of this claim of the school at Peru. Whether 
another school is located at some other point in the State or not, 
it is still true that the natural growth of the school at Peru will 
render the desired buildings absolutely necessary. Besides, it is 
certainly true that it is a wiser policy to build up one strong 
institution in which all citizens of the State may take pride, than 
to inadequately provide for two or more less thoroughly 
equipped and hence less efficient schools. In a report recently </seg>

STATE 8CHOOLS. 

made by Acting Chancellor Bessey, of the State University, to 
the State Educational Council, he summed up his argument as 
follows: 

"Financially, the question of additional Normal schools may 
well be answered in the negative at the present time, and doubtless, 
also, for a long time to come. A single school is manned 
by certain executive officers, and controlled by a board of 
trustees. It needs certain offices and conveniences for the conduct 
of the business of the school. Within certain limits these 
are the same for a school of moderate numbers or of large size. 
Two schools would require a duplicate in these particulars, with 
a corresponding outlay of public money. So too, within certain 
limits the library, laboratory, and classroom facilities needful for 
a school of moderate numbers need not be greatly enlarged for 
one of considerably larger numbers. And when it comes to the 
point of necessary enlargement of these, the relative expense is 
by no means as great as if the attempt be made to install a new 
plant. 

I hold the opinion that it will be far better for the educational 
interests of Nebraska that the State should build up its one Normal 
school by giving it liberal appropriations, so that it may be 
well housed, well equipped, and well manned, than to keep back 
such appropriations in order to found another school. A division 
of the money which the State is able and willing to use for normal 
school purposes would result in two Weaker and less effective 
schools, with poorer buildings, poorer appliances, and, what is 
worse, poorer men in training and preparation. We cannot afford 
to enter upon such a policy, and, in my opinion, it will be an 
educational blunder for the State to do so." 

Such judicious words from one who knows so well Nebraska's 
school system and educational work need no comment. They 
are unanswerable. W. A. Clark, 

President.

THE NEBRASKA INSTITUTE FOR THE BLIND 

This institution is situated in Nebraska City, Neb. It offers 
to the blind children of the State an education in literary, industrial 
and musical departments. 

The course of study in literary work is nearly the same as the 
high school course in the public schools. 

The musical department embraces training in voice, violin, 
piano, also band and orchestra work. 

It is probably equal to the conservatory work in the schools; 
is conducted by teachers of merit from the best schools of music. 

The industrial work embraces instruction in broom-making, 
hammock and net making, piano tuning and carpet weaving. 

The purpose of the school is to fit the student for intelligent 
citizenship and for self-support. 

Boarding, washing and tuition are furnished by the State 
during the school year free of cost to the child whose want of 
vision renders incapable of securing an education in the public 
schools of the State. 

The school merits the fostering care, the best wishes and the 
.support of the citizens of the State. 

J. E. Harris, 

Superintendent. 

NEBRASKA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. 

The Nebraska School for the Deaf is thoroughly and completely 
organized as a school. Each department and class is in 
the care of experts in their several lines of work. New departments 
have been organized and are getting splendid results. 
The literary departments are divided into the manual and oral 
schools. A few more than half the children receive instruction 
in speech and speech reading. They are doing well, some of 
them succeeding beyond the most sanguine expectations. The 
Nebraska Course of Study for district and village schools has 
been adopted, and the school closely graded. 

The industrial training is carefully looked after by teachers of 
marked ability. The work in sewing is sytematized after the 
plan used in the Pratt Institute. This is the only systematic </seg>

school of sewing in the State, and better results are being accomplished 
than can be secured by any other method. 

During the last two years two new buildings were erected, 
and they are types of three kind. A three-story pressed brick 
and stone school building, with slate roof and steel ceiling, 
equipped with all the modern conveniences, was one of these 
needed improvements; the other, a boiler, engine, and pump 
house which has been classified by expert engineers as the best 
arranged building for its purpose that there is in the State. The 
architect for this latter building was the teacher of manual training, 
who also superintended its construction. 

An exhibit of the school work was sent to the Paris exposition, 
and was awarded a diploma and silver medal. 

A complete exhibit of the work of the school was made at the 
Nebraska State Fair held at Lincoln in the fall of 1900. This 
was a competitive exhibit, and the work of the deaf children 
was in direct competition with the work of the hearing. More 
premiums were awarded to the Nebraska School for the Deaf 
than to all other schools making an exhibit. This was especially 
praiseworthy when premiums were received for work in English 
composition. The English language is not "the mother tongue'* 
of the deaf child; it is a translation of the sign language. 

The principle underlying all the instruction given in the institution 
is that the finished product must be perfect; "better than 
can be done by any one else" will not be accepted. Comparison 
of merit is not permitted. Perfection is the only criterion by 
which results are judged. 

The motto of the school is "Vigorous, Practical and Progressive." 
Practical in plan, progressive to develop, vigorous in 
execution. H. E. Dawes, 

Superintendent.

J. D. McKelvie was the first superintendent, then J. W. Sealrook 
for one year, and B. R. B. Weber now closing his fourth 
year. There are thirteen officers and teachers; total number 
of girls received, 417. They are placed on the merit system 
and can work out on their honor if they are good, in from fifteen 
to eighteen months, but often longer, and while all are committed 
until they are twenty-one years, yet in reality, it is in their 
own hands, for if they have no home, when on their honor, we 
find them one. Over sixty have been placed in homes the last 
four years; ten are married, three of whom are living in this 
county; and many others doing well. They attend school onehalf 
day eleven months out of the year, and work one-half 
day each. They have large play-grounds, and play-rooms when 
weather will not permit outdoors. They seem as happy as in 
public schools, but of course freedom is a blessing they all 
crave. Many say they never know a better home.

THE NEBRASKA STATE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR JUVENILE 

OFFENDERS (Boys). 

The wayward and unfortunate youths of the State are 
gathered here, not for punishment, but for proper training. In 
their unrestrained freedom they are recognized as "growing up 
in crime," and consequently a menace to good government. 

Charges are preferred in a court of record, and if sustained, 
the subject is committed to the care of the State until he is 21 
years old. By this means the State assumes the guardianship 
of the youth and undertakes to so train and culture the mind 
and body that they may be exponents of virtue, rather than vice, 
and thus become a blessing to society. 

Since the organization of this school in 1881, a total of 1,327 
boys have been received. 1,190 have been put out on parole, or 
Otherwise released, leaving 137, — our present membership. 

Under 16 years of age they may be committed on ex parte 
hearing on the general charge of incorrigibility. Between 16 </seg>

342 1 * 

STATE 8CHOOL8. 

and iS years of age they must be arraigned and found guilty of a 
statutory offense by a jury trial. No boy is committed after he 
is 1 8 years of age. 

The first impression the boy receives here is, that he is the 
arbiter of his own fortune. If he behaves, his road is easy. If 
he is obstreperous, by methods kind and yet forceful he is 
taught obedience, which is of prime importance in starting him 
aright. Every act of insubordination but lengthens his sojourn 
in the school. 

Day and night he is under surveillance, which does not 
intrude upon his liberty of action so long as he exerts himself in 
the proper direction. 

When a boy is received charged with vagrancy or mendicancy, 
there is charged against him 4,000 demerits, for incorrigibility 
5,000 demerits and for burglary or larceny 6,000 
demerits. By good behavior he is credited with ten merits each 
day. Three months of good behavior gives him a credit of 
1,000 merits. If he misbehaves slightly he gets no credit for 
that day. If he commits a flagrant breach of the rules he may 
be given extra demerits. So his own conduct governs^the 
length of time which must elapse before he balances his account. 
Then he must stay an "honor month" before he is a subject for 
parole. In practice the average length of service is about two 
and a half years. Some stay five years, some get out in a 
year, but they are not sent out unless they have a place to go 
where, it is reasonable to believe, they will be properly taken 
care of. 

About 75 per cent of those who go out become law abiding 
citizens. 

The school is divided into four grades according to age and 
size. Each grade occupies a separate building, which has a 
play-room and bath-room in the basement, schoolroom on^ first 
floor and dormitory in second story. All the boys march to a 
common dining room at the same time and thirty minutes is a 
meal period. 

They rise at 6 a. m. and retire at 8 p. m. Two grades are 
detailed to work and two grades are in school in the morning </seg>

for four hours. In the afternoon the occupation of the grades is 
reversed. 

Each grade is in charge of a grade manager and his wife 
who live in the building and exercise a parental care over them. 
At night a watchman is on duty in the dormitory. 
The grade manager is their instructor in the schoolroom and 
the best talent is employed. 
The deportment in the schoolroom is better and their aptitude 
for learning is almost equal to that shown in the average common 
school. The motto "thou must" is a factor with which 
they have had but little acquaintance, but it is cogent when 
continuously applied, as it is here, kindly and encouragingly. 
The common school branches are taught. Periodical enter- 

tainments are given consisting of dialogues, recitations and 
singing. 

The national holidays are observed with great zest. Special 
treats are given them upon such occasions. 

Outside talent is employed several times a year to lecture or 
give musical entertainments. 

In the playrooms the boys are furnished with newspapers and 
periodicals, and the library books for reading; also games, such 
as checkers, chess, Crbkinole and dominoes. Outside the "small 
boy penchant for marbles is gratified, besides playing the 
national games of football and baseball. Swimming, boating, 
nshing and skating are provided in season. 

Everything is systematized, and even in recreations the boys 
are urged to do their best . 

Under a corps of skilled instructors, who direct and help, the 
pupils do all the work incident to keeping in operation all the 
departments of the institution. 

They farm, garden, take care of stock, tend the lawns and 
flowers, wash dishes, cook, bake, scrub, keep buildings in order, 
laundry the clothes, butcher, fire the boilers, run the engines 
repair and make all the wearing apparel, bed linen, and shoes; 
do the carpenter work in the repair of buildings and furniture 
construct fences, make chests, tables and cabinets; and do all the </seg>

mechanical work and some of the writing for the eight page 
Industrial School Journal. 

The plant consists of the main building, five grade buildings, 
and the shop building, facing around a rectangle, thirty rods long 
and twelve rods wide; all supplied with hot and cold water, steam 
heat and electric lights. Besides these there is a boiler house, 
pump house, ice house, cow barn, horse barn, stock lots, sheds 
and crib. The State owns 320 acres of land, 15 of which lie 
under the irrigation ditch. 

All the shops and departments are very well equipped with 
machinery. 

Here the genius boy is taught cleanliness, regularity of habit, 
and continuity of purpose. He accomplishes something, feels 
encouraged, and gradually awakes to the realization that there is 
pleasure and benefit in doing things right, instead of "doing as 
he pleases," and doing them wrong. 

A resident chaplain looks after his spiritual welfare, and a 
salaried physician ministers to his bodily ailments. The institution 
is very healthfully located on a hill, and there is little sickness. 
No death has occurred in three years.

Superintendent. 

INSTITUTION FOR FEEBLE-MINDED YOUTH. 

BEATRICE, NEBRASKA. 

"This institution was established by the State of Nebraska for 
the benefit of feeble-minded children between the ages of five 
and eighteen years who are, by reason of their affliction, denied 
the educational advantages of our public schools, and who, likewise, 
because of their physical weakness, are necessarily 
dependent. 

"Besides shelter and protection, the prime object of said institution 
shall be to provide special means of improvement for that 
unfortunate portion of the community who were born, or by disease 
have become, imbecile or feeble-minded, and by a well 
adapted course of instruction reclaim them from their helpless 
condition, and through the development of their intellectual </seg>

faculties fit them as far as possible for usefulness in society. To 
this end there shall be furnished them such agricultural and 
mechanical education as they are capable of receiving." — Sec. 
2, Chap. 52, Session Laws of Nebraska, 1885. 

The education of this class includes not only the simple elements 
of instruction taught in our public schools and in the 
kindergarten, where that is practicable, but embraces a course 
of training in the more practical matters of every-day life. 
Plain and fancy sewing, embroidery and lace-work, housekeeping 
in all its branches, hammock and fly-net weaving, brush 
making, a sloid department is being added, and a tailor shop 
will soon be opened where the boys and girls will be taught 
tailoring in all of its details. 

The new buildings will be occupied by December 10th, thus 
increasing the number of pupils to about 300. 

Children of this class are often feeble in body as well as in 
mind. Their gait and voluntary movements are generally 
imperfect and slow, and their special senses inactive and undeveloped. 
Physical training and development, therefore, are 
essential in order that their mental improvement may be made 
permanent; hence the importance of gymnastic and callisthenic 
exercises in connection with our school work. 

The very feeble power of attention must be cultivated and 
increased by the most attractive means. The special senses 
must be trained and educated, vicious habits corrected, and the 
idea of obedience and moral obligation must be instilled and 
nourished. * * * * * 

The children are cared for by skilled attendants and nurses, 
and are taught by competent teachers. A special study is made 
of each pupil and everything that science can do is done to 
advance the mental, moral and physical welfare of the child.

BELLEVUE COLLEGE, BELLEVUE, NEB. 

The Presbyterian Synod of Nebraska founded Bellevue College 
in 1880, and opened the school in September, 1883, the site 
and the main building being donated by Hon. H. T. Clarke. 
The first building was completed in 1884, the second building in 
1890, the third in 1896, the fourth in 1897, the fifth in 1900, 
besides the heating plant, the water-works, and the farmer's house. 
The college has no debt. The property which is valued at 
$100,000, is as follows: Campus, 50 acres; farm adjoining 
campus, 2T4 acres; 30 Bellevue lots, 10 acres near Bellevue, 2 
Bellevue cottages, 2 Omaha lots, 160 acres in Frontier county, 
and the same in Hitchcock county, and the buildings above 
referred to, namely: Clarke Hall, Finlay Hall, Rankin Hall, 
Philadelphia Hall, Lowrie Hall, boiler house, pump house, farm 
house and barn. 

The scientific apparatus is valued at $2,000. The library 
contains 3,000 volumes, with card catalogue and modern conveniences. 
The athletic field immediately adjoins the college 
buildings. 

The college year is 37 weeks in length, beginning on the 
third Tuesday of September. The president is David R. Kerr, 
D. D. 

The number of teachers employed is 16; the number of students 
is 100; the number of graduates is 58. 

The mental development which the college affords to students 
is the same in breadth of subjects as offered in the best colleges 
east and west. The site is believed to be the most beautiful 
and attractive found in Nebraska. It is also historic. Bellevue 
was the first settlement in Nebraska Territory. Here was the 
first capitol. Here the first church was organized, and the first 
church building begun, a building yet in use. 

Every college building is crowded. The tone of the college 
is cultured and inspiring.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

CHADRON ACADEMY. 

Chadron Academy is located at Chadron, Nebraska, a division 
station of the F. E. &amp; M. V. Railroad, where the line forks, 
one branch running to Casper, Wyoming, and the other to the 
Black Hills region of South Dakota. It was founded in 1889 
by the Northwestern Association of Congregational churches in 
Nebraska, and is the only Christian school in a large region, 300 
miles east and west by 100 miles north and south. In this 
immense region there is no normal school, business college, or 
other institution of learning except the public schools; three 
high schools prepare for the university with conditions, but 
Chadron Academy is the only school that gives full preparation 
for college and university. 

There have been 101 graduates in classical, scientific, normal, 
and business courses. The Classical and Scientific courses give 
regular preparation for college, which is accepted without 
examination by Doane College, the University of Nebraska and 
other schools of higher learning. The Normal course gives 
thorough training to those who wish to teach and prepares them 
for a first grade certificate. The Business department gives a 
thorough course in bookkeeping and other commercial branches. 
Instruction is also given in elocution, physical culture, and military 
tactics. There is a Music department offering the finest 
advantages to be had in this region. 

The. Academy is provided with a good library and readingroom, 
and experimental apparatus for laboratory work in the 
natural sciences. The school-year consists of thirty-eight weeks 
and there are now enrolled ninety students in all departments. 
There are four regular teachers in the Literary department, 
three teachers of music, and one teacher of elocution and physical 
culture. The buildings and grounds of the Academy are 
valued at $10,000. 

The Chadron Academy is a Christian school and seeks to 
inspire its students with high ideals of life and character and 
scholarship. </seg>

PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 

BLAIR COLLEGE AND THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY. 

It is located at Blair, Nebraska, a thrifty little city of 3 — 4,000 
inhabitants, on the main lines of the C, St. P., M. and O., and 
the F., E. and M. V. R. R's. 

The College buildings are beautifully situated on the picturesque 
heights a little to the north-west of the city, only a short 
walk from the postoffice. 

It was founded by the United Danish Evang. Luthern Church 
in America, and is pre-eminently a Luthern College. 

While primarily a school founded for Danish-Americans, anyone, 
irrespective of 'sex or nationality, may attend, provided they 
are willing to obey the College rules and regulations. 

The most important courses are: American history, American 
literature, astronomy, bookkeeping and actual business, 
botany, chemistry, church history, civics, commercial law, 
Danish language, literature and history, didactics, dogmatics, 
drawing, English language, English literature, ethics, etymology, 
European history, exegesis, French, geography, geology, German, 
Greek, gymnastics and military science, logic, mathematics 
— arithmetic, algeSra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and 
surveying, — music, pedagogy, philosophy, physics, penmanship, 
religion, shorthand, typewriting, zoology. 

The Theological Seminary is the official theologicial school of 
the "United Church." It comprises a three-year course in 
theology, preceded by a four-year preparatory course — in all 
seven years. Graduates receive the degree of B. D. 

The Collegiate department offers two complete college 
courses of four years each, leading to the degrees of B. A., and 
B. Sc. These courses are thorough, and practically arranged, 
representing, as they do, the views of our best educators, as to 
what is necessary best to secure to the student the highest culture 
of the age. 

The Normal department is now one of the prominent features 
of Blair College. The following courses are offered : A fouryear 
course, including all the branches required for State certificate 
in' Nebraska, a three-year course, including all branches </seg>

            <seg id="p616">

required for first grade certificate, and a two-year course for 
students desiring to teach in Danish Parochial schools. A 
diploma is granted upon the completion of either of these 
courses. 

The Commercial department offers four thorough courses. 
The excellent Ellis Tablet, and Cabinet Systems are employed 
to the exclusion of the old text book systems. The time 
required to complete the fullest course varies from four months 
to two years, all according to preparation atrd ability. A 
diploma is granted everyone satisfactorily completing the 
advanced course. 

The Music department offers courses "in instrumental and 
vocal music. Instruction, including piano and organ, can be had 
for $10.00 per term of twenty-four lessons. Voice culture and 
harmony at rame rates. 

Students in this department may also take French, German or 
art drawing. 

THE CREIGHTON UNIVERSITY, OMAHA, NEB. 

Creighton University, Omaha, was incorporated in 1879. It 
administers the endowment fund left by Edward Creighton for 
the establishment and support of a classical department, or school 
of arts. The latter department is entirely free. The University 
has also a medical department, in which tuition is charged. The 
scientific, chemical, physical and astronomical departments are 
excellently equipped for teaching purposes, and are likewise free, 
a merely nominal charge being made for breakage. The astronomical 
observatory is especially well furnished with the latest 
and best appliances. A course of seven years leads up to the 
degree of A. B., four being for collegiate and three for preparatory 
or academic work. The average number of graduates receiving 
the A. B. has thus far been about eight each year, but 
the increase in the number of those who remain for a degree is 
becoming steadily more marked and gratifying, as is also the 
number of those who pursue postgraduate studies. The medical 
department has a four-year course, and last year's graduating 
class numbered twenty-two. Almost every year students who </seg>

PRIVATE 8CHOOLS. 

have complied with the requirements receive the Master's 
degree. The institution has conferred comparatively few honorary 
degrees. The session of the medical department lasts 
seven months and a half; the other departments require fortytwo 
weeks in the year. The total number of the professors in 
all the branches is fifty-seven, the students 360. There is no 
debt of any kind. The endowment, which is exclusively for the 
classical department, amounts to about $200,000. The grounds 
and buildings are worth about $230,000, the scientific apparatus 
$30,000. The number of volumes in the various libraries 
approximates 10,500, pamphlets 1,100, valued at $6,500. The 
Creighton Memorial Hospital is not the property of Creighton 
University, which nevertheless through favorable arrangements 
made by the founder and by the courtesy of the management, 
enjoys the exclusive use of the clinical facilities, which exceed 
those of all other Omaha hospitals combined. The University 
has no dormitories, the students boarding at home or with private 
families in the city. Board and lodging costs from $160 to 
$210 for a session of ten months. The professors readily give 
private assistance in their studies to those who, on account of a 
lack of opportunity in early life, find themselves older than the 
average student before being able to take up a classical course. 
Many such have come from neighboring States, encouraged by 
the cordial and helpful spirit which they knew awaited them. 
The running expenses of the college proper are reduced to a 
minimum, because the members of a religious order of the Catholic 
church give their services without any salary. Students of 
all denominations are received on equal terms. Societies of all 
kinds, literary, oratorical, dramatic, musical, athletic and religious 
flourish; and whatever helps towards the development of a 
manly, Christian character receives the cordial support of the 
faculty. 

COTNER UNIVERSITY, LINCOLN, NEB. 

Cotner University was organized in 1889, although the buildings 
were not ready for use until the following spring. In all 
departments, including the Lincoln Medical College, a department 
of the University, there have been about two hundred </seg>

            <seg id="p618">

8TATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

graduates, about half of whom are from the literary department. 
The property, worth about $100,000, is free of debt. The productive 
endowment is not large and consists mainly of temporary 
pledges of support, unproductive property and bequests. An 
active effort is being put forth to enlarge the foundations of the 
institution with brightening prospects of success. The library, 
though not large, is well selected and rapidly growing. A 
reading-room, furnished with the latest periodicals and several 
daily publications, is maintained. The scientific department is 
furnished with modern laboratory appliances suited to the general 
demands of the undergraduate work. The University 
dormitory furnishes good board at a very low rate, also rooms 
reserved for the use of ladies only. 

The entire expense of the school year of forty weeks need not 
exceed $125.00. The location is beautiful and healthful, near 
enough to the city for use of its advantages, lectures, libraries, 
etc., but sufficiently removed to be free from its temptations and 
distractions from student habits. 

In connection with a well organized Normal department, a 
summer school is usually maintained. 

W. P. Aylsworth, 

President. 

DOANE COLLEGE, CRETE, NEB. 

Doane College, located at Crete, is the Congregational College 
of the State. It was chartered in 1872. There has been 
nothing phenomenal in its growth, but it has grown steadily and 
healthily and is now one of the best educational institutions in 
Nebraska. Starting with one teacher, thirteen students, and no 
endowment, the last catalogue shows a faculty of thirteen, 
including the musical director, and four instructors, with an 
attendance during the year of 169, of whom ninety are in the 
college department. The permanent fund at the close of the 
last fiscal year amounted to a little over $79,000. The general 
management of the college is in charge of a self-perpetuating 
board of trustees, twenty-seven in number, and representing </seg>

various parts of the State. The first class to graduate in 1877 
numbered three; there are now 167 graduates, all but six ef 
whom are living. The college has nearly 600 acres of land 
adjoining Crete, a portion of which has been reserved for a 
campus. Here are four substantial brick buildings which have 
been erected at a cost of $55,000. One of these, Whitin 
Library, contains about 8,000 books and 5,000 pamphlets. The 
principal source. of income are donations, interest on invested 
funds, rent of land, tuition and room rent. The income from 
tuition is not large, as the charge to each student per year is 
only $17 in the academy, and $24 in the college. From the 
beginning the college has been dependent upon donations for its 
growth; in fact, its existence and maintainance has been largely 
due to the generous support of New England men and women 
who believe in Christian education. The annual expense of the 
institution is now about $17,000. 

FRANKLIN ACADEMY. 

Franklin Academy was founded in 1881. It has now two 
good buildings, which, with the campus of fifteen acres, is valued 
at $15,000. A small endowment amounting to $3,500 is 
invested for the Academy. Scientific apparatus and cabinets 
valued at $1,000, furnish well equipped laboratories for work in 
elementary science. The library contains 3,600 bound volumes 
and some hundred pamphlets. The total value of the property 
held by the Academy, including some real estate, is estimated at 
about $28,000. 

Eight salaried teachers are employed. Five in the Literary 
department and three in the Music department. 1,275 students 
in all have been enrolled. 170 have been graduated, 96 of 
these are from the college preparatory courses, the others from 
the Normal, the Business or the Music departments. 72 have 
entered college, many of whom have been graduated with honor 
and are filling honored positions as teachers, professional men or 
in business life. The present enrollment is 123, (Dec. 1, 1900.) 
The school year covers ten months, during the last ten weeks 
of which special opportunities are offered teachers from the </seg>

common schools, in the way of reviews in the studies required 
for teachers certificates, and lectures on the theory and art of 
teaching. 

Franklin Academy was the first school to be established in 
southwest Nebraska, and in the nineteen years of its existence 
it has won an enviable reputation for thoroughness and integrity, 
and for the quality of its work as the foundation of character. 
Its teachers are college men and women, skilled teachers, and in 
full sympathy with the highest ideals in public and private 
school training. The fact that out of its limited number of 
graduates have come three college professors, four academy 
principals, seven instructors in academies, and a large number 
of successful high school and common school teachers, shows 
something of the quality of its work. 

Plans have been drawn by a skilled architect and work will 
soon begin on a third building planned to accommodate the 
rapidly growing Music department, which is now much in need 
of more room. Altogether the friends of the institution are 
congratulating themselves and the management on the signs of 
a very prosperous future. 

FREMONT NORMAL SCHOOL AND COMMERCIAL COLLEGE 

The Fremont Normal school was established fifteen years 
ago, and has had a substantial growth, not only in the number 
of students enrolled, which for the year 1900 numbered 1650, 
but in all other respects. 

Additions have been necessary from time to time, and now 
the main building contains forty-two rooms conveniently 
arranged for school purposes. In addition to the main building 
there are two large halls containing 212 rooms, lighted with 
electricity, and many of them supplied with city water and hot 
water heat. 

There is a good working library of 3,500 volumes, and this, 
together with the leading magazines and periodicals to be found 
in the reading rooms, furnishes all the material necessary for 
supplementary reading. 

Scientific apparatus to the amount of $2,000 is in use con- </seg>

stantly by the students enrolled in the Scientific department. 

The total value of the properly of the school is now $100,000, 
and this will be increased as fast as the growing demands of the 
institution require it. 

The faculty consists of twenty-one scholarly men and women, 
who are devoted to their work, and command the respect of the 
rapidly growing number of young men and women who attend. 

The Normal is in session fifty weeks during the year, and the 
great number of courses makes it possible for students to enter 
at any time of the year. In addition to the regular courses there 
are a Conservatory of Music, a School of Pharmacy and a 
Shorthand and Business College. 

A strong feature of the Normal is the Practice and Summer 
School which has been in session for twelve years. Each succeeding 
year has added strength to the Summer School and the 
management has spared no means to make the coming session 
the most interesting and profitable of them all. 

Not the least in importance is the moral and social atmosphere 
which surrounds this institution. Literary societies are maintained 
for which two halls are set apart exclusively. Lecture 
courses are provided furnishing students with an opportunity to 
hear the best talent on the lecture platform. 

The needs of students — moral, mental and physical — are 
studied and provided for as far as it is possible. 

GATES ACADEMY. 

"The Congregational Academy of Northeastern Nebraska." 

The history of Gates Academy properly begins with that of 
Gates College. The organization of the College, the choosing 
of its name in honor of Rev. Hiram N. Gates, for many years 
superintendent of Home Missions in the State, its location at 
Neligh, and the selection of the first board of trustees, was the 
work of the Northwest Association of Congregational Churches 
at its meeting in Norfolk, August 10, 1881. 

The College was incorporated September 30, 1881, and the 
Academic department opened for students September 1, 1882. 
The first freshmen class was admitted to the College department 

30 </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

September i, 1886, and the first class graduated from the full 
course in June, 1890. The institution has graduated students 
from the different courses as follows : From the College Classical, 
13; College Scientific, 9; Normal, 16; Conservatory of 
Music, 18; Classical and Scientific Preparatory, 84; Business, 11. 

The income proving inadequate for the maintenance of a full 
Collegiate course, the trustees at their annual meeting of June, 
1899, decided to discontinue collegiate work and reorganize the 
school on the academy basis. The name was accordingly 
changed to Gates Academy, the work in the auxiliary courses 
being continued as in former years. At the present time the 
school offers Classical and Scientific preparatory, Normal, and 
Music courses of four years each, and a Business course of one 
year. 

Two four-year courses of study in preparation for college 
work are offered — Classical and Scientific. The work in these 
courses is designed to cover all the requirements for entrance to 
the best colleges and universities, east or west. 

Careful thought has been given to the work of this department 
and a four-year course outlined, based on the requirements 
for a State life certificate. Those who are planning to teach 
will find this course especially shaped to their needs. 

The Conservatory offers exceptional advantages to those 
desiring instruction in instrumental or vocal music. Work in 
this department may be taken up as a specialty, or in connection 
with other courses. The Consevatory course has been planned 
with reference to securing a systematic development of the musical 
faculties and a thorough knowledge, of music in all its 
higher branches. 

To meet the needs of those requiring a business training the 
Business course has been established, and more attention will be 
given to the work in this department than heretofore. A competent 
instructor has been secured for the courses in shorthand 
and typewriting. 

Thorough and systematic instruction in elocution is offered. 
Training in this line may carried on separately or in connection 
with other work. </seg>

            <seg id="p623">

PRIVATK SCHOOLS. 

The laboratory equipment and the library facilities are excellent 
for a school of this grade. The buildings belonging to the 
Academy are valued as follows: Recitation Hall, $8,000; Gaylord 
Hail, $14,000; Laboratory, $1,800. There are five teachers 
employed in the Academic department, one in Elocution, one_ in 
the Business department, and one in the Conservatory of Music. 
Over ninety students were enrolled last year. 

The earnest moral life which has marked Gates through all 
her vicissitudes still survives, the prophecy of continued life and 

growth. 

GRAND ISLAND COLLEGE. 

Grand Island College was founded in 1892. It is under the auspices 
of ths Baptists of Nebraska, and is their only school in this 
State. It has a college building valued at $45,000, and a ladies* 
dormitory valued at $12,000. These buildings were given, free 
of debt, to the trustees of the college by the citizens of Grand 
Island. The campus, city lots, and other real estate are valued 
at $6,000. The college has a productive endowment fund of 
$35,000. Of this sum $12,500 was the gift of the American 
Baptist Education society. The college is attempting to raise 
during the present-year the further sum of $35,000. This effort, 
if successful, will increase the permanent endowment funds to 
$70,000. These funds are loaned only on first mortgages on 
farm property. The scientific apparatus is valued at $2,000; 
the library has 2,120 volumes and is valued at $2,000. The 
college gives instruction eleven months in the year, and employs 
eleven instructors. The first year's enrollment was 62; last 
year's enrollment of students was 235. There were twelve 
graduates last year; five from the College department, and six 
from the Business department, and one from the Normal department. 


HASTINGS BUSINESS COLLEGE. 

In September, 1896, Messrs. Lummis and Miller started the 
Hastings Business college. Like all educational institutions, its 
growth at first was slow. In March, 1898, Mr. H. S. Miller 
purchased Mr. Lummis' interest and assumed the sole manage- </seg>

ment. In November, of the same year, the institution was 
regularly incorporated with Prof. H. S. Miller as president. No 
college in the State of similar class made more rapid or substantial 
progress. A few years since it was forced to seek larger 
quarters. Its various departments now occupy the second and 
third stories of the Shedd block. Its various recitation rooms 
are roomy, well lighted and finely appointed. There are three 
classrooms; one devoted to the teaching of shorthand; another 
to the business practice department, and besides the cloakrooms 
there is a handsome suite of reception and office rooms. The 
year's course comprises nine and one-half months' instruction. 
Of late years an average of fifteen graduates per year have 
received diplomas from this institution. The faculty at present 
comprises four instructors. The enrollment of students last 
year numbered 150. The average this year will exceed last 
year's attendance. 

The splendid growth and success of this school is due wholly 
to the personality and abilities of President Miller. 

The courses of instruction presented by this institution are 
founded on business principles and practical theories. The college 
has inserted a number of branches not usually found in a 
business course, but which is deemed absolutely essential to a 
well-balanced and fully-equipped business man or woman. 

The penmanship and pen art, shorthand and typewriting, and 
English courses are each especially strong, and when completed 
equips ihe graduate for successful work in his department. 

KEARNEY NORMAL SCHOOL, BUSINESS COLLEGE, AND CONSERVA- 

TORY OF MUSIC.

under the laws of Nebraska, with M. A. Brown, editor 
of the Kearney Hub; Willis L. Hand, attorney; George W. 
Whiteaker, real estate agent; H. M. Draper, Mrs. H. M. Draper

PRIVATE SCHOOLS 

Departments were provided as follows: Normal, commercial, 
music, vocal and instrumental, shorthand and typewriting, and 
art in all branches. 

The school opened with about fifty pupils enrolled in all 
departments, which number quickly swelled to over one hundred 
as the fact of the school's existence became known, and its 
opportunities and work more fully appreciated. 

The growth of the school has been steady from the first and 
now numbers from 150 to 200 pupils annually. The present 
year bids fair to greatly exceed this number. 

The Normal department is academic in its scope, offering 
preparation for the State University as well as preparation for 
teaching. 

The Commercial department offers the usual American business 
college course, the time required being from nine months 
to one year. 

The Music department is organized on the conservatory plan 
and offers first class training in voice, piano and violin. 

A summer normal term of six weeks has been a feature of 
the work of this school from the first, drawing an attendance of 
over 100 pupils each summer for review work in teachers' 
branches. 

The school library numbers about 300 volumes. The school 
is in session from Sept. 1, to about the middle of Julv. A school 
paper called the Uf- To-JJate, is published quarterly, and the 
school is popularly known as the Up-to-date school. 

LUTHER ACADEMY. 

Luther Academy, Wahoo, Saunders county, was established 
in 1883 by the Nebraska Conference of the Augustana Synod, 
and is owned and controlled by that denomination. It has three 
departments of study, six instructors, and over 100 pupils. Its 
property is valued at $21,528. Its yearly income from tuition 
is $1,000, room rent $300, appropriations $1,400, gifts and donations 
$1,600, sundries $350 (it has no endowment), and its 
yearly expenses are $4,600. It has a carefully selected library 
of over 2,000 volumes, a museum containing 300 zoological </seg>

specimens, a numismatic collection of 200 coins, a geological 
collection numbering 100 petrifications and rocks, an herbarium 
of 1,000 species of plants, and physical apparatus worth $200. 
The Music department owns a two-manual pipe organ, two 
pianos, two reed organs, and various smaller instruments; total 
value $1,200. The reading room is equipped with books of 
reference, and some of the leading magazines of the day comprising 
twenty periodicals on a variety of subjects, such as Hirper's 
Weekly, The Forum, The Nebraska Teacher, Business, 
Music, etc. 

The greatest drawback at present to the further development 
of the school is lack of room. The conference, however, having 
lately removed the incumbrance of a debt of long standing, is 
now seriously considering the erection of a larger and more 
commodious building. 

The departments and courses of study are as follow 

I. The Academic Department. 

1. The Classical Course. 

2. The Normal Course. 

3. The English Course. 

II. The Commercial Department 

III. The Music Department. 

The total enrollment in all the departments during 1899-1900 
was 106; in the Academic, 57; in the Commercial, 37; in the 
Music Department, 29; graduates in all departments, 18. 

The instructors were S. M. Hill, A. M., L. H. D., president; 
Miss Augusta Stenholm, instructor in English; Julius H. Flodman, 
A. M., instructor in Latin and the sciences; Joseph M. 
Oshlund, M. Accts., principal of the commercial department;

large at present, is to be increased in the near future. The 
school will be open nine months in the year. The first semester 
begins in September, the second in February. Students have 
access to the city library, also to the library of the State Universky. 
It is the aim of the school to prepare for any college or 
university. The classics are emphasized as being the basis of the 
truest liberal culture. 

Students may at any time enter classes for which they are 
prepared; but only students from schools accredited to the 
State University, or to other institutions of equal rank, applying 
for advanced standing, will be admitted without examination. 

The needs of deficient University students are carefully looked 
after and they themselves made to feel at home. Of the sixty 
students now in attendance at least three-fourths are preparing 
to enter the State University. Teachers, 6. 

LINCOLN BUSINESS COLLEGE. 

The Lincoln Business College was founded by Prof. D. R. 
Lillibridge in 1884 and the institution soon earned for itself the 
reputation of being one of the leading business educators of the 
West. It consisted of two departments and offered two courses, 
stenographic and business. 

In 1896, Mr. Lillibridge died and the school was purchased 
by Messrs. J. L. Stephens and Harry E. Wilson, who later associated 
with them Messrs. W. C. Stephens and Wm. G. Bishop. 
Under the guidance of these gentlemen, the school has maintained 
its high reputation and has continued to increase in numbers 
and influence. 

In the winter of 1897, the old home of the school, corner iith 
and O streets, was crowded to its utmost capacity. Necessity 
demanded larger quarters, and since June, 1898, its new home 
has been in new and elegant quarters in the Oliver building. 

The success of the institution has been due to the energy of 
its promoters and to the fact that Lincoln offers incomparable 
advantages to young people seeking an education. </seg>

THE NEBRASKA WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY 

The Nebraska Wesleyan University was organized in December, 
1886. It is the result of an effort to unify the educational 
interests of the Methodist Episcopal church within the State.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT 8 REPORT. 

Hams, now instructor of oratory at Cornell University, N. Y., 
has been the foremost school in the West in its special line of 
oratorical work, and the high standard to which it has attained 
in the past is demonstrated by work now being done by its 
graduates. 

The number of students graduated has been sixty-four — some 
holding positions in academies and universities of the middle 
west. Its present location is an ideal one for the work carried 
on — situated, as it is, in the heart of the city, all equipments 
which are necessary for the study of elocution, oratory and all 
pertaining thereto. The college contains a hall with a seating 
capacity of 400 — a gymnasium together with numerous class 
rooms and parlors handsomely furnished. 

Its present principal, Edward G. Maggi, is a graduate of the 
New England College of Oratory and the New England 
University, and instructor of oratory at the Nebraska State 
University. He is ably assisted by a competent corps of teachers. 
Miss Lillie Anderson, who is at the head of the Delsarte and 
Physical Culture department, is an able teacher, having completed 
a thorough course under the tutorship of the most famous 
instructors in both Europe and America. Lilla Mae Maggi is 
instructor of elocution, dramatic and expressive action. Bessie 
Tuckerman, instructor in elocution, drama! ic action, expressive 
action and voice building. Lethenia B. Watson, instructor of 
voice expression and voice building, etc. 

The study of Shakespeare's tragedies and comedies from an 
emotional and reading standpoint is given special attention — the 
different plays being reviewed from time to time in Prof. 
Maggi's Shakespeare class. The officers are: W. A. Poynter, 
president; Edward G. Maggi, principal; L. Anderson, secretary.

PLAINVIEW NORMAL COLLEGE. 

The Plainview Normal is situated at Plainview, Pierce county 
Neb., at the junction of the Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley and the 
Great Northern railways. The building is of pres«ed brick, fourstories 
high, heated throughout by steam ; it is elegantly finished 
and well furnished. It aims at present to do work equivalent to 
the State Normal and the preparatory department of the State 
University. Its faculty at piesent numbers eight. Four universities, 
including one State University (Wisconsin), are represented 
on its faculty. The enrollment of students is most gratimg 
to the friends of education in Nebraska, being nearly 200 
the past year — 200 different students. The present year promises 
an increase. The scho3l is in the midst of a rich and rapidly 
growing richer farming and stock raising section. A census 
shows nearly 300 young people of over fifteen years of age, 
within a radius of fifteen miles, and not more than half a dozen 
attending school elsewhere. There is room here for a first-class 
school, and its promoters are sparing neither effort nor money to 
make it such. The value of building $15,000, aside from 300 
acres of land owned by the association and adjoining the campus; 
scientific apparatus, $500; small library, school open all year. 

ST. FRANCIS ACADEMY, COLUMBUS, NEB. 

This institution is conducted by the Sisters of St. Francis. 
The object of the institution is to secure for Catholic children a 
practical Christian education, which includes with the other ordinary 
school studies, also, a thorough instruction in Christian 
doctrine. It also affords children of German or Polish parentage 
the opportunity to learn to read and write the language of their 
parents. Music is taught with special care. 

The Academy is situated in the northeastern part of the city, 
and combines the accommodations of the city with the healthful 
climate of the country and the necessary retirement so conducive 
to study. 

The Academy is surrounded by extensive and attractive 
grounds, which afford inducements to the pupils to engage in 
healthful 9x\A pleasant exercise. </seg>

PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 

The building is spacious, is supplied with electric light, is well 
heated and ventilated. It is connected with a good sewer system 
and the city water-works. 

The buildings cost about $22,000. There are five large, well 
lighted classrooms. The school has twelve grades and employs 
seven teachers. 

The children of Catholic parents belonging to Columbus 
parish are instructed free of charge. Children from other 
places pay a small tuition fee. 

The school is open during ten months of the year. The number 
of pupils enrolled last year was 245. 

The school was first opened November 4, 1878, with two 
classrooms. Since then others have been added. The Academy 
can accommodate about sixty boarders. 

st. mary's church. 

St. Mary's is only a parochial day school. It does not aspire 
to the title of academy, neither do the Sisters keep any boarders. 

The school was built in 1893 at a cost of $9,000.00, including 
grounds and school furniture. We employ four Sisters of the 
Order of St. Joseph as teachers, and have an average attendance 
of 130 pupils. The monthly tuition is seventy-five cents for a 
child, but poor children can attend without any pay — the church 
making up the deficiency in the Sisters' salary. We correspond 
in opening and closing every day and in the number of months 
of teaching with the public schools. After reaching the age of 
fourteen our children generally continue their studies in the 
public school and high school. 

UNION COLLEGE. 

Union college, located at College View, Neb., a suburb of 
Lincoln, is now in its tenth year. T. he institution is under the 
auspices of the General Conference of the Seventh Day Adventists, 
the board of managers being elected at the biennial session 
of the conference. The college derives its support and patronage 
chiefly from Nebraska and its bordering States, though 
students were enrolled last year from twenty-eight different </seg>

States or countries. Until 1899 the college year consisted of tei&gt; 
months; since that time it has consisted of three terms, fall, 
winter and spring, of three months each. 

The capacity of the school is about 500 students, its enrollment 
last year being 526 for the entire time. The highest 
enrollment for any one year was in 1893, when it reached 607. 
During the following years of financial depression the attendance 
dropped about one-half, or averaging abou 1 . 300 a year. The 
college does not depend upon any endowment funds, but has 
been able to meet all running expenses, promptly meet all bills, 
and make some improvements, from the ordinary income from 
board, room rent and tuition. The total cash receipts during the 
last college year were $27,939.86; total expenditures, $22,872.56; 
leaving a gain for the year of $5,067.30. The value of college 
property, including buildings, is above $200,000.00. 

The college employs on the average about twenty- five 
teachers and instructors. Nearly 100 students have graduated 
since 1891. The library consists of about 3,000 volumes, 
besides pamphlets, magazines, etc. The college runs its own 
electric light plant, and water and steam system. Also a steam 
laundry, a bakery and broom factory. About 400 acres of land 
are cultivated, from which are raised corn, wheat, oats, broom 
corn, vegetables, etc. All labor is performed by students, for 
which they are paid in cash or tuition. 

Besides the English, separate departments are maintained for 
the German and Scandinavian students under native teachers. 
The English speaking students also find these departments to 
their advantage in studying the foreign languages. 

WEEPING WATER ACADEMY. 

This educational institution was started in the fall of 1885, and 
has been at work steadily for nine calendar months, or 35 to 40 
weeks, per year ever since. 

Siarting with several business men and a pastor as assistants, 
and but one regular teacher, it has developed so as to employ 
four full course college graduates for all of their time in the liter- </seg>

ary work, and two fully qualified musicians in the conservatory 
of music. 

The attendance last year included 86 persons in literary work, 
most of them continuing through the year. Besides some of 
these, the conservatory enrolled 50 others, making a net attendance 
of- 136. 

The school has graduated in its 13 classes 81 persons from its 
college preparatory or normal courses, none of which are less 
than three years from the ninth grade. Sixty-five of these graduates 
were fully prepared for language courses in college, and 36 
of them have already gone on to college or other later schools. 
More will go. 

The cash endowment is very small as yet, but pledges in hand 
to be paid annually toward the current expenses of the school, 
are a similar feature. These make what may be called a living 
endowment, and should afford about $1,000 a year toward the 
support of the school work. 

The library now contains 900 bound books, and is being continually 
added to. The total estimate of the property of the 
institution, made in June, 1900, showed a sum total of $10,908.51. 

In laboratory facilities, fittings and appliances, the school is in 
good condition for effective work in the field it covers. 

During all the life of this Academy it has fosteredh igh ideals,, 
maintained high standards, and had in its plans the interests of 
broad, thorough education for the State, as well as for its immediate 
students. 

The Academy as an institution has for its plan and place to 
cover fully and quite exclusively the field of secondary education; 
acknowledgedly a critical and poorly occupied field in the State 
school system. • With this purpose, academy courses will cover 
the range from country or district school to full and elective college 
preparation. We believe it is the natural connecting link of 
the higher and lower systems, and a thing to be fostered. In. 
this plan and purpose the school at Weeping Water has tried ta 
make a good record, and we intend it shall make only 'forward, 
steps in this path as the future opens. </seg>

5. Use a different paper for each branch and pin together 
the separate sheets on ODe subject. Do not fold papers unless 
directed to do so by the examiner. 

6. Hand the examiner one dollar with your first paper. The

been thoroughly drilled in mental exercises. 

We would suggest that the county superintendent conduct 
the examination as heretofore, having applicants write nothing 
whatever but the number of the question and the answer. 

Add some questions if thought best. Urge the importance ef 
this mental work in the schools, for too little attention is given 
1o it in the majority of cases.)
