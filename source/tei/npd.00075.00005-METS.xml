            <seg id="p003">The Mechanical Dairy Cooler on Nebraska Farms E. K. BRACKETT anii E. li. LEWIS Considerable interest has been manifested in Nebraska in electrically operated mechanical cooler unit installations, small enough to be practical for the farmer-dairyman who milks from 15 to 20 cows. Large commercial dairies are without doubt using mechanical refrigeration successfully. Installations on farms in Nebraska have thus far been few in number. Four of these situated near Lincoln have been carefully studied, both in construction and in operation, by the Engineering Department of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station as a part of its Rural Electric Service Project. .•-'■■' Pig. l. — The small, poorly constructed building used on Dairy Number 1. The dairyman was successfully producing good milk on a ; • rented farm on which all the buildings w:ere old. • In the spring of 1929, when this study was begun, two small dairies (Numbers 1 and 2 in this bulletin) near Lincoln were using mechanical units for cooling milk and another near Lincoln and one near Seward were preparing to install coolers. The latter two completed the installations and started the units in May and June respectively. ! All four installations were made by the same manufacturer. j All of the storage cold rooms provided for air circulation and were of the walk - in type. At that date no other type could be found on a farm within a radius of 50 miles of Lincoln. ! Only two of the cold rooms were alike in construction. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 249 DESCRIPTION OF INSTALLATIONS AND EQUIPMENT Figures 2, 4, 6, and 8 show some of the details of construc - tion used in each cold room. Figures 3, 5, 7, and 9 show plans of the dairy rooms. In each case the cold room is indicated at A. The cold room for Dairy Number 1 is shown in detail in Figure 2, and in plan in Figui'e 3. This was an old meat - refrigei'ating box worked over. The outside panel work was lined with two thicknesses, less than an inch together, of celotex placed as shown in Figure 2. The tongue-and-grooved board lining had been set iii to allow a one-inch air space in the walls. Sheet iron protected the celotex floor. At the time this study was begun this sheet iron was found to be full of holes, and the celotex was wet. This entire box, thus constructed, stood on a concrete floor and was housed in. the building shown in Figure 1. The installation had been in operation one year when observations were begun. \\ \VlII-~- — ~~~~ JceiuaIg | ! \~—r-~~~^Z- -- " VftOATiD I &lt; lift I / 1° o &amp;Qi O C CLO &lt;Zl£?jC&gt;&amp;l&amp;z&lt;D syc&gt; &lt;J&gt;£ Vim l§l£l HI s"*" 11 1vw/'lS Cl ' Bcw?o u ' OiiOq O I I Jrf JtIIs WtftfT^ Sr" ' *HEET II5OA) COVCUHD Fig. 2. — Details of construction of the cooler box or cold room in Dairy Number 1.

An old box had been used by the operator of Dairy Number 2 but in 1928 it had been torn down and replaced by a cold room constructed as shown in Figure 4. The outside wall had been made by plastering on the hollow-tile building wall, and 4 inches of sheet cork had been placed on this. The ceil - ing had been insulated with 6 inches of sawdust and 4 inches of sheet cork. Studs of the inside walls had been placed the flat way, making a thin partition, and the walls had been plastered on both sides and insulated with 4 inches of sheet cork. Inside the cold room the walls and ceiling had a hard - plaster finish. The floor had been made by placing hollow tile flat on the concrete floor of the dairy building (shown in Figure 5) and covering this with 2 inches of concrete. The outside walls of the cold rooms of Numbers 3 and 4 were the walls of the dairy buildings covered with plaster, insulated with 4 inches of sheet cork, and coated on the in - side with hard, smooth-finish cement plaster. The ceiling of the cold room of Number 3 (Figs. 6 and 7) was plastered, </seg>

One inside .wall had 6 inches of cork insulation and the ceiling cork had an asphalt finish, which was waterproofed with an odorless asphaltum compound. This waterproofing was used instead of the hard plaster coat used in Dairy Number 3. The floors of these two storage cold rooms were made of concrete insulated with 4 inches of cork and finished with concrete as shown in Figures 6 and 8. The sheets of cork were 2 inches thick. The walls were rough plastered and the uneven spots were smoothed to give good contact w T ith the insulation. The cork was fitted, then dipped in a hot asphaltum bath, and then placed and secured. The second thickness of cork was placed in such a way as to break joints with the first. Hot asphaltum was used to give protection to the cork and to seal the joints against dampness. In all cases the sheet cork was made fast </seg>

The waterproofed cork on ceiling and extra thickness on inner walls are the essential differences from those shown in Figure 6. to the walls and ceilings with galvanized nails of various lengths, according to the thickness of the insulation. It 'will be noticed that with the exception of Dairy Number 1; the cold room has been placed so that the outside walls receive direct sunlight in the mornings only. The dairy buildings give protection from direct sunlight most of the day. | METHODS OF OPERATION All four dairymen were willing to help obtain information on the operation of their plants and aided the men from the Agricultural Engineering Department in every way. In each instance the milk was handled in much the same manner. The whole milk fresh from the cows was passed over a two - part tubular aerator. The upper part of each aerator was used for water circulation, the lower part for the circulation </seg>

NOTE— Each of the brine tanks was placed along one side of the cold room. The clearance I &lt;•] iw the tank or.below the baffle where one was in place was about 30 inches. Table 1 permits a comparison of the installations. Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 present operation, figures on each dairy. As indicated, definite values have not been attempted in the tables because data could not be secured daily or several times per day as would be. necessary when securing some of the data. No attempt has been made to show the efficiency of operation or of installation. Records of temperatures in the cold room and of the milk before it was cooled further by the brine operation after the tap water had removed some of the heat were insufficient in number to make accurate efficiency values. Differences in milk temperatures before cooling varied widely. Dairies Number 2 and 3 hauled the milk on a truck from the farm to a dairy room in town, causing some heat loss in transit. Dairy Number 4 bought some milk that was brought to 160° F. before passing over the cooler. All four dairies attempted to cool the milk down to 40° F. and to keep the cold room below 40°. This temperature was possible, but some of the time a temperature as high as 50° F. was re - corded. </seg>

Tables 2 to 5 indicate date when observations were befrun. Meter readings taken the first of each month gave the amounts shown. Some of the high energy consumption in cooling the milk was caused by the small amount of heat taken from the milk by the cooling water flowing thru the aerator.. This was due in Dairy Number 4 to scarcity of water and in Number 3 to other causes. The heat from the boiler near the door of the cold room of Number 3 was very noticeable. A rush of hot air into the cold room could be noticed when the. door was opened at any time when the boiler was being fired and the dairy utensils were being washed and sterilized. Some method of controlling this boiler and sterilizer heat would add materially to the efficiency of the cooling plant. In Dairy Number 4 the cold room had to be opened in the afternoon when the direct sunlight could strike inside the storage space. This was a period of several minutes when trucks were </seg>

The fractional kilowatt-hour shown as that average needed to cool each gallon of milk may vary widely each season for each cooling unit and room. being loaded and the milk in cans was being replaced by crates of bottled milk. Planning the woi'k, cautioning the workers about leaving the cold room door open, and a shade on the west of the building could materially reduce this heat transfer. The performance on Dairy Number 1 was very creditable when the poor construction and location of the cold room are considered. COMPARISON OF COSTS An attempt was made to get some general comparisons of operation costs of these mechanical units as compared to costs of ice. The operator of Dairy Number 1 reported that </seg>
            <seg id="p018">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 249 he previously used about $70 worth of ice on about the same quantity of milk as shown in Table 2, while Dairy Number 2 reported the former use of about 400 to 500 pounds of ice daily in the summer months before installing the mechanical unit. Another dairy near Lincoln, which handles about the same amount of milk as Dairy Number 2, is using 400 to 500 pounds of ice daily in the summer months. All charges in the tables have been made only against the amount of milk cooled. In every cold room, at intervals, the amount of refrigeration needed to care for the milk and cream was augmented by that necessary to care for the added load in cooling melons, milk drinks; foods, etc. Because of the intervals between visits of the men taking observations, very little consideration could be given to heat absorption from such sources. Some of the owners of the dairies were careful, but wide - open doors, men gathering in cold rooms for cool drinks, and poor doors and door fasteners, etc., all increased the amount of refrigeration necessary. The cold rooms on Dairies Num - ber 3 and 4 are built as approved by refrigerating construc - tion engineers. However, both the owners of these dairies are using mechanical refrigeration for the first time and may show better efficiency after more experience. Farmer-dairy - men are not accustomed to the operation of refrigerating plants. Some time will elapse before many of the little and apparently unimportant points in the care and operation will be given the time and thought the whole plant must receive if the best performance is obtained. FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN BUILDING A COLD ROOM A walk-in type of dry, air-circulated box is convenient when milk is handled as the four dairies studied were handling it, where one-half pint, pint, and quart bottles and cans of various sizes are to be held in cold storage. To provide re - frigeration for the needs of the business under these condi - tions, the factors to be considered are: l.j Total time the cold-room doors are open in 24 hours, 2. Sizes of openings most used, 3. Size of cold room, 4. Insulation of cold room, 5. Difference of temperature between inside and. outside of 1 cold room, 6. Quantity and temperature of the milk placed in the cold room, 7. Quantity and amount of heat removed from the milk thru | brine circulation. When the average person, not familiar with mechanical re - frigeration, wishes to determine his needs, he is confronted </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Mechanical Dairy Cooler on Nebraska Farms with many different ways of calculating and many trade shoi-t-cut terms used by salesmen, such as : melting ice equiv - alent, pound of refrigeration, ton of refrigeration, pounds of ice melting in 24 hours, and British thermal units or B.t.u. These can be compared by the use of very simple arithmetic. Everyone is familiar with the cooling effect when ice melts. Whether it is believed that the ice in melting gives off cold or. absorbs heat, there is a disappearance of heat. Engineers have given this absorption of heat a unit of measure and a name. I A pound of refrigeration is equal to the refrigeration pro - duced by the melting of one pound of ice. One pound of ice in melting absorbs 144 British thermal units or " 144 B. t. u." The American ton of refrigeration adds the time factor with the cooling rate equivalent to the cooling effect of 2,000 pounds of ice melting in 24 hours, or 1,200 B. t. u. per hour, or 288,000 B. t. u. in 24 hours. When the ton of ice melts, it absoi-bs 288,000 B. t. u. One B. t. u. when used in simple calculations is the amount of heat that will change one pound of water thru one Fahrenheit degree. To make various terms a little clearer, consider the problem of Dairy Number 3 of this bulletin and the seven factors mentioned on page 18 that should be ; considered when 125 gallons of milk must be. cooled and stored daily, as that dairy is now doing. The first five factors with the exception of Number 4 can be considered together in a general example in calculating the amount of refrigeration necessary for this dairy. The cold room of Dairy Number 3 is 6'6" x 5'6" x 7' inside, or has 250.25 cubic feet of air capacity. The low temperature at which this milk will need to be held is 35° F. The mean outside temperature here in Nebraska is seldom over 80° F. This shows that the maximum temperature difference between outside air and the air in the cold room must be about 45 degrees. A cubic foot of this air will weigh about .08 pounds and will have a heat capacity or specific heat of .24 times that of water. If the door of the cold room is open a few seconds the air in this room will absorb heat. The number of heat units for the 45 degrees of temperature difference is 45 x 250.25 x .08 x .24 or 216 B. t. u. for one change of air in this cold room. It is quite possible that the big door, 2'6" x 6'6", is opened often enough to change the cold room air 10 times in 24 hours. This would give 2,160 B. t. u. to be extracted, or 2,160 divided by 288,000, or .007 ton, or 14 pounds of refrigeration needed to make up for the loss when the door is opened. In this type of dairying the removal of heat from the in - coming milk is the largest factor in the mechanical refrigerat- </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 249 ing operation There are 125 gallons of milk coming to the cooler at about 95° F. This milk is cooled over a two-part tubular aerator. Hydrant water flowing in the upper half brings the milk temperature down to about 70° F This water averages about 57° F. and the operator is supposed to regulate the flow of milk to allow about 6 gallons of water to flow thru the cons of the aerator while one gallon of milk flows over them. If the milk is cooled to 35° F the brine must lower the temperature 35 degrees more. The heat units, w™ f"" iJ£ removed depend on the pounds of milk, the temperature difference, and the specific heat, or heat capacity as compared to that of water. Milk weighs 8.6 pounds per gallon and has a specific heat of .9. It is to have a temper ature change ,of 35 degrees. The heat to be extracted will equal 125 x 8.6 x .9 x 35, or 33,860 B. t. u Then 33 860 divided by 288,000 equals .117 ton, or 235 pounds of refrig - eration just for brine cooling the milk to 35' from 70 F the approximate temperature of the milk after the well water" has removed some of the heat. . The value of insulation is recognized but. often its im - portance is not appreciated, nor do many people stop to study the effect ot extra insulation.

            <seg id="p021">Mechanical Dairy Cooler on Nebraska Farms From these three examples it will be seen that the total amount of refrigeration needed will be as follows: For change of temperature in cold room 14 pounds For cooling 125 gallons of milk 35 degrees.... 235 pounds For loss of heat thru walls 6 pounds Total 255 pounds This does not take in the losses thru the brine pipes, poor door fittings; and thru heat that is in the bottles, crates, cans, and other materials that go into a walk-in box on a farm dairy. Nor does it allow for enlarging the business. These can only be estimated, but the addition of enough to make 400 pounds of refrigeration per 24 hours will not be too much. On the assumption that the compressor and motor should not operate more than 12 to 15 hours out of every 24, a plant should be large enough to produce at least 400 pounds of refrigeration during the 12 to 15 hours' running time. It is a good plan to provide from 50 to 75 per cent more refrig - eration than is necessary at the time of purchase. This added amount will care for emergencies and isome future growth in the business. . With the indirect expansion system as used on the four dairies studied, brine storage and circulation are provided. When used in addition to water cooling, the quantity of brine should be great enough to give a circulation of 2 to 3 gallons of brine per gallon of milk cooled by water over the tubular aerator, with not more than 10 degrees of change in temperature of the brine for the amount of milk run for continuous cooling. The brine should have a 20 to 25 per cent concentration and a freezing point below 10° F. To estimate the amount of brine necessary for the instal - lation in Dairy Number 3, the following values and calcula - tions can be used. As indicated in the calculations for the heat that must be taken from the milk during a temperature change of 35 degrees, the number of pounds of liquid multi - plied by its specific heat and again by the temperature differ - ence, as 125 x 8.6 x :9 x 35, gives 33,860 B. t. u. to be ex - tracted. Usually it is assumed that if 125 gallons of milk is cooled in the 24-hour day, about one-half of this amount is cooled each morning and one-half each evening, and the amount of brine necessary is only that required to cool one - half the maximum daily production of milk. If this brine has a 20 to 25 per cent concentration, the customary strength, it will weigh slightly more than 10 pounds to the gallon and will have a specific heat of .72. If the allowable change in the temperatux*e of the brine in the tank is 10 degrees, the heat that one gallon of brine will take up </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 240 will be 10 x. 72x10, or 72 B. t. u. The number of gallons of brine needed to cool one-half of 125 or 62.5 gallons of milk, or in other words to remove one-half of 33,860 B. t. u.. or 16,930 B. t. u., is 16,930 divided by 72. or 235 gallons. Often a few extra gallons of brine are added to help care for extra loss thru circulation pipes, pump, etc. It will require over an hour to run the 62.5 gallons of milk over the tubular cooler. As the refrigerator system is automatic in operation. during that hour the compressor can replace about 6.000 B. t. u. lost by the brine while cooling the milk. The load then that the brine must carry; will be 16,930 minus 6.000, or 10,930 B. t. u., and this divided by 72, the B. t. u. one gallon of brine will take up, equals 150 gallons of brine necessary instead of the 235 gallons that would be needed if the com - pressor did not operate while the milk is being cooled over the aerator: Usually 20 to 30 per cent more brine than is necessary at the beginning should be provided. Expansion in business,- deterioration of the solution, or other causes make this provision a good one. In considering the type and amount of mechanical refrig - eration to provide for, the farmer-dairyman should consider the source of power, the kind of. business, service from com - pany, reliability of manufacturer, the benefits to be derived. and the necessity- for careful handling of his product before and after cooling. . .
