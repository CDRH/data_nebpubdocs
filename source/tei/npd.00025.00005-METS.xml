            <seg id="p040">[ASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIKTY Before taking up the first paper on the program, the society listened to two very enjoyable numbers by the Falls City orchestra. ■le President: The first regular paper on the pragram this after - will be on the subject, "Opportunities for Horticulture in South Nebraska," by Mr. Christy. Opportunities for Horticulture There are at the present time many young men, who feeling that they cannot invest twelve to twenty thousand in a 160 acre farm and ever expect to pay for it, and believing that a farm of less dimensions is too small for a bread winner are drifting to the cities to become street car conductors, clerks, or street pavers at a living salary- But their pay checks are seldom large enough to leave any surplus, after the nec&gt; - and unnecessary month's expenses are paid. And the rule is to be in debt about half the amount of the check at the end of the month. The results are they seldom own a home. They soon learn to labor to put in time. And their highest ambition is to draw a pay check, already half spent. Every young man, with either brains or energy, should be at work for himself, if it is only to run a peanut stand. There are but few men who have lead honest, industrious lives than cannot obtain credit enough to get a hold on ten acres of land. And ten acres of land near some good shipping point in Southeast Nebraska, scientifically cared for, will support and keep busy an ideal Roosevelt family. Kten acres one can not have a big apple orchard, in fact, I would umber so valuable land with apples, peaches, or pears. But for the surest crops and greatest returns per acre plant the small fruit. It alway proves the big money maker. Four acres of a ten acre farm should be planted to strawberries, Sen. Dunlap, Warfield, and a few other standard varieties are the ones to plant. Do not invest in the new and untried varieties that it requires pases of catalogues to describe their many virtues, and that sell at eight and ten times the price of the standard varieties. Then, too, buy from some responsible firm that will stand back of their guarantee if anything proves untrue to name. There is many a gold Tmck handed out in Ne - braska in the form of nursery stock, but with so many reliable firms in the state it is the purchaser's own fault when he gets swindled. There is no more excuse for buying nursery stock from some transient sal&gt; that comes along than there would be for depositing your money with harvest hand that comes to town instead of putting it in a bank, backed and guaranteed by financially responsible citizens. Kiur acres of strawberries will guarantee an income of better than undred dollars ($400.00) per year, if the records of the last twelve are to be relied unon. ill SiHitlien^t \&lt;-lim&gt;kii G. S.

Blackberries are the easiest grown and the easiest picked of any of the berries and the demand for them is growing every and I expect to see the blackberry acreage quadrupled in the near future. Pears are also in great demand and there are a few localities in which blight does but little damage. And in one of these favored sec - tions I had rather own a pear orchard than either an apple or peach orchard. There are thousands of dollars spent for fruit every year that should come to this section of Xbraska. And the fruits thar be depended upon for better than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per acre are Strawberries, and Blackberries. Kestion: Mr. Christy, what do you consider the best variety of pear itheast Nebraska? Mr. Christy: For a good commercial variety I think the Kieffer is probably the best. This ground around here, though, is too rich for grow - ing good pears. Further southeast of Falls City where the ground is rich. Bk soil with some sand on top, is better. Most of this ground right i here is too rich though. Question: Is there any particular way of taking care of i&gt;t&gt;ar&gt; i make them bear? E. Christy. No, I think not. This idea of driving nails into trees, ng wire around them, etc., I do not think much of. The best way ve them good care and cultivation and let them follow out the laws ire. You cannot change the laws of nature in this way.

We took a stage for Rockport, Mo, at ten cents per mile and rode down the hills. We carried fence m. pry the coach out of the mud in the ravines. Then we would walk ui&gt; hill ind ride down hill. We arrived at Rockport one or two days late. From Rockport we walked io Brownsville, eight miles, and were as far M we cared to go. Brownsville fifty years ago was the third city in the territory, doing an immense business and drawing trade from southeastern Nebraska and northwestern Kansas for over 100 miles. But voting bonds were their undoing and today she retains her former greatness in name only. Klftj \&gt;iir&gt; in Nebriiskii </seg>

The hay and meal are being shipped to all parts of the world, and some of our people are crowding brome interests to the front. In fifty years we have seen the iron horse supplant the ox teams; we have seen the deer, antelope, buffalo, either exterminated or driven back to the Rocky mountains. In fifty years we have seen telephones, wireless tele - graphy come, and electricity harnessed to draw cars and automobiles. The self binder, band cutter, straw stacker, two and three rowed corn planteers, and a thousand other devices to lighten labor have been Looking back fifty fifty years it seems only a span, but in progress it's up to a thousand years preceding it in inventions, education, arts, etc. If we judge the future by the past fifty years, the mind can not im - agine the strides that will come in the next fifty years. We have had our ups and downs as might be expected in a new coun - try, but I am safe in saying we have had more ups than downs, or our land would not have raised from $1.25 an acre to %~~&lt; and 2lno la In the fall of 1866 we had our first visitation of grasshoppers. Word came that they were where Lincoln now stands, and moving southeast at a rate of four or five miles a day, devouring every green thing. Some thought when they reached the Xemaha river they would be drowned and never reach the river counties, but one day about 1 o'clock something began to drop, and in an hour they filled the sky like a snowstorm. Some places they seemed to be two or three deep and they seemed to want our crops, and we stood by and saw them taken. I had a flock of turkeys and when the grasshoppers began to fall the turkeys got busy but only for a short time as they got too full for utterance. It was funny to see them stand, and see so many grasshoppers go to waste. Again in 1874 they came, devastating the country. They deposited their eg - the fall. Hatching out in the spring they ate everything within ten miles of the river and On July 1 they took wings and flew away, going where, nobody knows, but probably to some other planet. We fought them with tar, coal oil, fire, but they were too numerous. A kind providence ordered them to move, and they went. We have had bed bugs, chintz bugs, fleas, lice, mosquitoes, wood ticks, dog ticks and politics. The combination as bad as it is, is not in it with a grasshop - per scourge. Referring to one of the above plagues, namely politics, while « in the territory we were disfranchised from national politics, but had a delegate to congress who was allowed to speak but not to vote. The main attraction to go there and sit like a lump on a log was mileage and salary. Still it kept politics from going out of fashion until we became a state. The political parties were pretty evenly divided in our first elec - tion of J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska City and David Butler of Pawnee were pitted against each other for governor. Morton was elected by eight votes, fraud having been found in Rock Bluff precinct in ("ass </seg>

Our first apples in Nebraska were free from worms. Nine-tenths of all the fruit *as perfect, but in those days we had thousands of birds, quail, prairie chicken, ducks and geese, and we lived sumptuously on them until they were all gone. We now pay our money for spray pumps that cannot compete with our feathered friends in keeping the enemies of our fruit down. In conclusion I would like to give you some experiences of the fifty years in Nebraska, but my paper is already too long, so I will give you but one of my introductions to buffalo wallers, as they were called in those days. In December, 1858, one morning a gray wolf came between our stable and house (we had no barns those days) and my brother-in-law and I mounted horses and gave it a chase. There was a light snow on the ground, filling the draws, and we thought we had the wolf. I took a short cut across a draw to head him off, when my horse found a buffalo waller. He lit with his frone feet on the other bank and his hind part dropped straight down in the snow. The ice on my seat, being on such a slant, I couldn't hold it, and I went down, I guess to see what was the matter. The horse scrambled and finally got out with me holding to his tail. I have always thought I started to grow grey hair from that introduction, but maybe not. The President: I am sure that we are all g'.ad to hear Mr. Swan's paper, which gives the horticultural history of our state for the last fifty years. We can hardly realize that it is only within these fifty years that our state has grown up to be one of the great producing states of y! understand that Mr. Bruning, who was to give a talk on the sub - of "Rare and Hardy Shrubs and Flowers " is not here but that he lent a paper to be read before the Society. His paper is as follows: Rare and Hnrdv Shrubs and Flowers. W. H. Bruning, Cedar Bluffs At the request of some of our members I will write a few lines on flowers, but I want to say right now that this is not to be taken as an advertisement for I do not care to sell any plants or seed, but I do want to improve what we now have and get more new hardy flowers.

Kne President: Mr. Henry C Smith, of Falls City, who is interested extensively in orchards and horticulture in general in this section state, is with us and 1 am sure that we would like to hear a few from him. Mr. Smith: Ladies and Uentlemen: — I am almost entirely new to the horticultural business, although 1 am somewhat interested in the growing of apple orchards and seeing what can be done along that line. I simply wanted to be allowed to come here and meet with you and absorb infor - mation and learn from you all I can, and if you people can while you are here I would like to have you come out to our country and around here and see some of our orchards and farms. ■ou are all familiar with the horticultural products of Richardson y. One o€ my orchards is north of town here, and I think tin better anywhere in the state. Question: How is your crop this year, Mr. Smith? Wil you have a full crop or not? Ir. Smith: Well, 1 presume we will get sixty per cent of a crop. We ying to spray these orchards just as the Government wishes the to be done. We have now sprayed three times. Mr. Merrell, of the 1 States Department of Agriculture, will tell you of this spraying row. We have sprayed Yellow Transparent, Grimes' Golden, Ben , and Winesap.

Primarily the orchard and garden furnish the source of supply of a most necessary portion of the subsistence of every family, viz., vegetables and fruit.. If we can not secure these fresh from our own garden and orchard, weare forced to use a much inferior and more expensive article in the form of canned goods. A proper knowledge of how to grow fresh vegetables and fruits would minister to the health and happiness of all those who are not now proficient in the art. From a purely economic point of view, there is every reason why the farmer should study I questions and should become so thoroughly familiar with methods of growing trees and fruits that he may be able to supply his family more generously than he will ever do if he does not raise them on the farm There are excellent reasons aside from economic ones why the farmer should learn how to grow choice fruits, shelter belts, and groves for his farmstead.

Trees have been planted and i'ly cultivated for a year or two aud then left to shift for theins. fighting grass and drought on the one hand and cattle and horses and on the other. Between these and insect pests the tree claims \&gt; by the early settlers and many of the groves set more recently hav&gt; short-lived. Hut we have reached an era of better things. The leaders in pion.-er horticulture represented in this Society have developed varieties hardy in the different regions of the state. Thoroufh cultivation has .lied in all the drier regions, and pioneer planting has been in most regions which can be used as a guide to future planting. This iv, through persistent labor, lias acquired the knowledge which will -sfully extend the fruit-growing belt until great areas of the to the west and northwest now practically without fruit may ha. abundance for their home use. In this problem of extending the tree growing and fruit growin. tlie horticulturist lias been a pioneer in teaching the benefits of tillage to increase the water-holding power of the soil. Probably no single line of agricultural education at our University is of so great benefit t lie study of the relation of tillage to plan growth. M principles are understood, trees and fruits may be grown with safety where it would be quite impossible without it. Young orchards ;ng at the experiment station at North Platte have shown no effect Jury by drought under good cultivation, and many young orchar egion seem to have an abundance of moisture under proper tillage, ids is a region where to abandon tillage would probably result in trous drought.

Khe arguments for a practical agricultural education apply wit' rce to men and women engaged in horticultural pursuits. These of work are highly technical in their nature. They demand ng, which can only be secured through long, practical experience rough instruction from those having this special knowledge. The School of Agriculture stands for advanced knowledge along all iltural lines, and the Experiment Station is ever seeking for new facts to help in developing and extending the horticultural interests of the At the central station, orchards are being grown under different methods of treatment, viz, clean cultivation; cultivation with cover - crops for ripening the wood in autumn, growing trees with a regular croji also grown on the land, etc., etc. Varieties are being tested both of trees, small fruits and vegetables.

This list will be materially increased next year. An effort will be made to determine what ornamental shrubs and hardy perennials can safely be planted by the farmers in the region to be grown under good farm conditions The University also attempts to maintain a high class of instr desiring this instruction and makes jrticultural lines for all student a part of the required work i the School of Agriculture.

The school-garden is a well-developed feature of the German and ther continental schools and many schools in this country. In Germany most of the teachers are men, who have practically a life tenure of office. They are given a large garden to be operated by the school to help out their meagre salaries. This garden furnishes the laboratory where any study of plant growth can be demonstrated, and these studies become a leading feature in the school. In America, where the school garden idea has been tried it has been universally successful in arousing the interest of the pupils in nature. In many city schools, the children have continued to care for their little plat of ground after the school had closed for the summer, each pupil being anxious that his plat of land should present a partment at Horticultur A line of education which might do much for the cause of country md incidentally for the extension of horticulture is the promotion of nature study, school gardens and simple agricultural instruction in the country schools.

With such a uni- U interest among children in beautifying their school home, can it ■ ubted that the introduction of this feature into the rural school will stimulate intellectual growth and train the child of a true and abiding love for the country and to a desire to beautify the farm home by shade and ornamental plants and by surrounding that home with an air of harmony and fitness, of sympathy and grace, which indicate the subordi - ■ of the commerce of the farm to the higher purposes of life. This mania for material prosperity and povery of appreciation of the beautiful in home surroundings have driven many farmers' children from the farm a little appreciation, a little effort to secure this harmony of home surroundings, would have given far different results. The farmers' clubs, debating societies and farmers' institutes furnish a most excellent opportunity to extend horticultural knowledge among the i&gt;eople. The men who are willing to devote themselves to such work should take advntage of every institute to get a discussion of thes« - 1'lans should be developed simple enough so that the farmer can do the work easily and quickly without too much hand labor, member of this society should demonstrate to his neighbors that he has I the problem for himself, by producing the choicest fruits and •.tbles and that he is thoroughly up to date in all his methods of culture and of combating curculio, codling moth, bacterial diseases his example will be more convincing than any amount of advice which he fails to follow on his own farm. ■he President: We are now to b Crooks. favored with a vocal solo by Mi.-, ■liss Crooks sang "Ah, I Have Sighed to Rest Me," from II Trova - and "Ixive Me and the World is Mine," which were enjoyed very by those present.

That in the home surrounded in the distance with fields of waving grain, maize and beautiful meadows scattered over with sleek and graceful stock, and it may be nestling beneath some sheltered nook adorned with trees of • i hues and style of growth, in such a rose-embowered home the for - tunate owner lives, with the birds singing their songs of pnise and tentment.

The person who loves order and who intelligently observes the wonderful arrangement of order in the natural world, becomes orderly in his daily life. The man who loves beauty and symmetry and who revels in the fragrance of I laboratory will be likely to exude a sweetness in his intercourse with his family and fellowmen and show a certain symmetry of life and char - acter, and, as the ever and inevitable developing plan of lite goes on. his ■ ptiou of Hie and its meaning, together with his individual resp bility, will be very likely to impress him deeply. For many years, in fact, almost since I was able to think and ob he personality of the tree and flower lover has left a deep im Kon upon me, and often when I have come into meetings similar to and met in a more individual way people whom we might generalize the term Horticulturist, I have felt a standing-out of their pen :. There is an indefinable something that is always most attract - &gt;out them. Well do I remember, in the village where I was born, an old lady who was passionately fond of gardens and flowers. She had a very large old-fashioned flower garden. Oh. the loveliness and sweetness of that old garden! Beauty everywhere. No nook or corner but what held hid - den away some choice plant, flower or fern. Nearly always was the dear old woman to be found amongst her beloved flowers. I can see her now, although many years have gone by, with her big garden hat covering her sweet, shilling face, tottering here and there, giving care to this flower </seg>
            <seg id="p055">visitor- approached — for all were welcome in lere there were no high fences to obstruct the view — she was willing, nay anxious to share her treasures with them. The beauty of the flowers was re- flected in her face. As she picked her bouquets and distributed them here and there, the generossity and prodigality of the plants and flowers beauty sometimes trodden under foct by the thoughtless throng, these to him had 1 i him had language and meaning which caused him to burst forth ir fty response to the loveliness he saw. Kuskin, with his eye, nay very soul, trained in all that was beautiful, ■whose character as one analyzes it seems to have fed upon the flowers scattered up and down his pathway, — his splendid spirit echoed the beauty as he saw it. He was one who could find in the coloring of a bird's wing splendid thought and conception. The things that he heard mat. tid the things that he saw found echo in the lofty ideals and inspiring ords he has left as a legacy to mankind. A few years ago it was my pleasure to look down upon the home of Tennyson in the Isle of Wight, an embowered home, a home fit for a poet and the home of a poet. I remember saying, "A man scarce could help writing poetry amidst such surroundings." As we reflect that me of the greatest poets of modern times, who with his keen analytical lower seemed able to probe to the very core of human nature and one could almost say the Divine, we must come to the conclusion that his ■haracter was fed by the world in which he lived His ability to reach over and forward across the brink, as it were, was enhanced by his response to the things which surrounded him. These men may have been able and doubtless would have given splendid ideals and noble thought amidst the blackened- voi coal and mining districts of the Old World, yet the fact that they sought beauty, were enthralled by it, became its willing slave, doubly, nay, one can hardly say how much it intensified their individual capacity for sub - lime thought and expression. Thus we do well to lay great stress upon the nece^itv of educating and providing for the sustenance of that part caught response in her actions. The very personality of this dear old creature was a counterpart of the loveliness, sweetness and genei of that old garden. Through my life, reaching from my boyhood, some of the closest pei-onal friends ! have had have been tree, plant and flower lovers. Not a superficial love, but what one likes to term what you gentlemen understand when I say a passionate love of the beautiful The woodland, the plant, the flowers, the rocks, have fui i avenue down which have traveled some of the sweetest singers of all times.

A little incident happened a da_v of two ago at my home that wa fraught with much interest and deep meaning. To get the f what I wish to say I must go back a few years. Nearly thirty j where I live, when first coming there it was wild prairie land. X to attract the birds to nest with us, we planted trees, and oh: the intense pleasure it gave us as one variety after anoth birds came to be our companions and neighbors for the summer Our boys as they became big enough were deeply interested in bird lif. summer succeeding summer brought us new visitors, their delight great and when the golden oriole came it was an event In the hist our home not to be forgotten. Well, the years have come anil gon&gt;- many are the lessons trees, flowers and birds have taught us A few days ago my youngest boy found a crippled young oriole in one of he groves; he brought it to the house and placed it in a box by the window. The loving, anxious mother bird in some way or ai found out where it was She came close to the house and window, her usual timidity in her anxiety for the baby bird. So distn ■tiat the boys took it out and left it on the lawn; fondly she tarn. and in her caressing way enticed it amongst the taller gr.i it protection. The lesson, ah well! loss of fear for self in th thought of another. The spirit of such an incident furnished ■ that we would have been deprived of if environment had not pro the proper Ther. thing real interesting in watching the development of thought and ideals in family life. These in great measure are Ilia ■ if the ebb and flow c,f local community and national life. The awakening of the mental faculties, the gradual spinning of the garments that enwrap our sentimental personality, the perceptive and appreciative qualities that are so dependent for nutrition upon what immediately sur - rounds them, impels one to the conclusion that to get a robust anil healthy character the proper food must be furnished to secure such a This leads me to refer to something which I know all of you gentle - men are much interested in.

Those of us who can look back and see our own life windings, most readily appreciate the truth of such a conclusion. The demand that has arisen during the last decade, that we return o the country a disciplined mentality and a cultured and refined person - ality, is not of urgan growth but reflects the sentiment of those who have been in touch with the vitalizing power that country life affords. True it s and I rejoice in the fact that so many of our masters and past-ma - n commercial life are giving splendid aid and assurance of assistance. Our newspaper and men of literary pursuits, together with those in all kinds of professional life, are responding and offering to join hands in the audable object of sending back to rural life and its pursuits, those of vigorous intellect and strong character who are carrying seed that, when deposited in so responsive a soil as is afforded by our splendid Nebraska prairies, will bear a harvest of immense benefit to our people. Yet I am ed to reflect that it is only those who have drank long at the fountain of rural enjoyment who are able to put an approximately correct mate upon the value of such a movement. For many years in our country there seemed to exist the idea that life amidst rural pursuits had a tendency to dwarf and wither culture and refinement; still for some reason or another the material that was necessary to keep alive and aggressively vigorous the commercial and professional life of our populous centers, like the food which the congre - gated toilers require, has had to be provided b yttve country. Surely then the soil that can produce has the ability not merely of procreation but of maintaining and bringing to full fruition every element of personal charm of character, and if there is any place in the world that a man cai. off with elastic tread into the great beyond it is from the home surrounded by all those beautiful things that nature has so abundantly provided and which the true Horticulturist is ever in quest of. Oh yes I am compelled to believe and say that the Horticulturist does not confine himself to merely material selection and cultivation, but his very love of natural </seg>

There stems to be a close linking of characteristics between trees, plants and people, similar laws of growth and development appear to govern. The suppleness and pliability of the sappling and its lesponse to early training, pictures largely the lements so marked in the first years of human life The gaining of strength and growth with the reaching out of twig and limb reflects the developing processes ever going on in the expansion of our own personalities, and the maturing and gaining of more rigidity of character, with the ability to shelter and protect, is the counterpart of the disposition of the well grown and trained man or The same law of similarity seems to run through many phases of growth in the natural kingdom. It may be bordering on that which is of a metaphysical nature, but whatever may have been the pro - cesses by which men and plants have reached their present stage of development, there is a wonderful affinity existing between them, and as we submit this idea to a more acute analysis we discover they were made for each other and that our higher instincts whether innate or acquired find, in consorting with that which we commonly refer to as the natural world, a supreme gratification to a very apparent demand of the superior part of our being, and the finer the quality of our personal appreciation, whether of an aesthetic or scientific character, the deeper our pei - pleasure. There is another side of our subject that is interesting to note Those of us who have for a lengthy period sojourned in Nebraska, cannot help having noticed the influence that Horticulture and tree planting In general has had upon not merely the personal life of our people but upon its development along a higher plane, if I may be permitted to so d nate it, of their material life. Whilst receiving benefits of the higher order it is well for us to think for a moment or two of the imu. material result that the planting, both of forest and fruit trees has had, and perhaps nowhere in our country is there better opportunity for ag - gressive work in the forestry than in this state. Notable leaders in the membership of this society for many years liave preached both by ex - ample and precept the importance of Forestry and Arbor-culture ai. a direct result, blessings of untold value have followed. The trees they planted and those whom they inspired to become planters have both given rich result. A few weeks ago it was my great pleasure to make a visit to Arbor Lodge. As one thinks of the log house that was the first habitation of the illustrious Morton, and of the scheme of beauty that was evolved from his striking personality, what a full tide it was that ebbed and It between him and his surroundings.

The fierce suns in strictly c nmmercial pursuits often parch and we are thirsty for the gentle rains and noiseless dews that opportunity for reflection gives. Lofty spirit and sublime thought are fed and refreshed by such a companionship. I believe that men become more and more optimistic by consorting with trees, flowers and shrubs. Like the bird who frequents their abiding place, when he sings, he is apt to be looking upward, for the enrgizing power which is behind all naural life impels it skyward, so with mankind who seeks the companionship nf the beautiful, there is an uplifting and soaring ability imparted which carries him above the clouds. As a rule the pessimist seeks the darkened cave and is willing to grope around in the shadow Before closing permit me to say a word or two in regard to a sub- U&gt;on which so much attention has of late been paid in our country, that is, Forestry and the re-forestation of the territory that in so many ways has been the ruthless prey of the mere moneyseeker and those care - less and thoughtless people who, with no concern apparently for their own or the weal of the future residents of the land, have destroyed that which has such a vital connection with the material condition both pres - ent and future of our country. The attention which thinking people are giving to this very important subject has been and unquestionably will be. fruitful of immense, good To have the occupant of the presidential chair together with many leaders in thought and action speaking and acting in no uncertain way, betokens better things for the nation. The crimin - ality of the waste in regard to our timber lands has been most repre - hensible. The destructive instead of the constructive principle has tar - ried too long with us and it behooves those who are alive to what a condition of affairs will inevitably lead to, that they Join hands in stem - ming the tide of such ruthless waste and seek to be the leaders in an ag - gressive campaign which has tor its object the retimebering of much land that has been depleted of trees, and the further extension of the forest area in the prairie states, espcially in our own state. Such a mision will be fraught with wonderful opportunity for good. I shall not stop to specifically enumerate the different phases of this work or the peculiar adaptability of a large portion of our state for the furtherance of this scheme but content myself with the broad assertion that here in Nebraska we have placed in our hands by a wise Creator a territory that calls into service those whose eyes and thoughts are not merely hungering for more territory to devastate in their fearful greed for immediate pecuniary benefit, but who carry with them the trade mark and working tools of the true tree lover — those constructive and perceptive principles whose planting is not merely the gratification of self and whose vision perceives the untold benefits that pass as a legacy to those who are to follow. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The large area of Nebraska which seems peculiarly fitted for timber purposes, as proven by private and governmental experiments, and which for mere tillage purposes has an uncertain value, affords a splendid field for expansive work in forestry. The formulating and carrying into action plans for this specific work, will depend largely upon the men who are tree lovers, for like all great movements for the ultimate good, the ethical principle is the vitalizing power. In this society and in kindred societies there have been those who for many years were apparently "Crying in the Wilderness" but preaching in no uncertain terms against the prodigal waste of our Nation - al resources, and especially against the greedy devastation of our forest The seed sown and the splendid work done by these pioneers in this particular line has and is bearing fruit, and when one reflects for a moment upon the personnel of the convention recently called by our esteemed president, we see that the thinking force of the nation is aroused and aggressive measures for an all round economy in the use of nature's gifts are being taken. Let us pause and ask the question, Is this spirit of altruism born of the gross materiality of those who seek to get for themselves alone, and who live just for the present?" No, it is the fruitage of the motive that prompts the planting and conserving for future generations, and yet as we weigh immediate results, both in character and personal enjoyment, they who are governed by the latter spirit are infinitely enriched and those who succeed to the heritage they pass on are made wealthy thereby. EJefore closing let me say that the task of the missionary of beauty delightful one, the essence of whose spirit is to provide enjoyment thers; the perfume arising from such service is free from selfi. - the inevitable sequence must be an elevating and refining power gst our people. One of my old friends who recently returned from attending the neth reunion of his class at Amherst College, in speaking of the culture and refinement of New England, and the beauty of its Horticulture and Arborculture, said, "It will take a long, long time to get anything ap - :nately like it in Nebraska." Yes, perhaps it will, yet we believe in these fertile soils of this responsive prairie land there exist - ability to nurture and bring to full fruition that which perhaps MM be a dream of the idealist, and I am optimist enough to believe that in the personality of the people who are scattered over these splendid lands are the elements which will respond to the beguiling influence of the beautiful in nature and art and as the years go on our own hearts will be gladdened in seeing the evidence of an ever increasing culture and refinement accompanied with a personal charm of character which is the crown of all human life.

Merrell, r Dept. of Agriculture Iie problem of spraying the apple orchard has probably received attention from the experiment stations, and more discussion and ation as to its merits by the farmers and fruit growers than ther single subject in the whole domain of Horticulture. A few of the history of this important practice may not be amiss on this on. If we look backward a space of twenty-five or thirty \&gt;. iat the art of spraying is still in its infancy, and that it is developing two different lines on the opposite sides of the Atlantic ocean. About me, probably in 1878, the introduction of the downy mildew Ban American disease, into the grape growing districts of n Europe, caused the native fruit growers there to experiment with s powders and liquid preparations for the purpose of preventing or curing this serious imported fungous disease. In the year ks of mildew were very severe and but few grapes ripened in the infested territory, except some along the highways. The maturity of this highway fruit was due to the following cause. It was the cu of some growers who had vines easily accessible to bad boys and other human marauders to coat these vines with verdigris, thus giving them the appearance of having been poisoned, to scare away the th This year, in the interests of economy, a mixture of milk of lime and copper sulphate had been used instead of verdigris, and to the wonder of the proprietors, the vines, covered with this preparation, were the only ones maturing fruit. This account, is in brief, the history of the discovery of bordeaux mixture. A few years previous to these events in France the spread of the Colorado potato beetle and the subsequent discovery in this country of efficacy of arsenical poisons in the control of this native pest, called the attention of some progressive farmers to the possibility of killing the canker worm by the same means.

New York, who reported to the Western New York Horticultu ly in .January. 1ST!', the results of a trial of Paris Green the pre. season against the canker worm in the orchard of Mr. Haynes Niagara county, New York. Not only was the orchard rid of ea worms, but the ravages of the coddling moth within the fruit were greatly lessened. Thus we are indebted to the fruit growers of France f ■ .tv of the Bordeaux mixture, and to the wide-awake farmer of own country for the use of poisons in a commercial way against de~t tive apple insects. The discovery of Bordeaux mixture and the us Kisons against insects was made before the foundation of the ex - nt stations which, however, have been of inestimable value in per - formulas for the various solutions and in acquiring and dil nating information of all kinds relating to this and other important Horticultural subjects While the apple industry in Nebraska is confined to the eastern part of the state, and is of comparatively recent origin, it is by no mean." unimportant. The census of 1900 shows a total of 3,877,329 trees and a production of 1,343,497 bushels. Since this date these figures have un - doubtedly greatly increased. Nebraska is fortunate in having but two or three ordinarily important insect enemies of the apple, and but one or two important apple diseases. One of these insects and one of thes. eases, viz: the coddling moth and the apple scab may cause a total of the crop in some cases. Now it has been shown repeatedly in some us of the country that these two pests may be profitable controlled by spraying. If then, it is possible to save a large proportion of this loss at a small cost, why should we not do so? To spray efficiently, it is i to spray understandingly, and to do this the fruit grower must know why he sprays and how and when to do it. The question, "Why is it more necessary to spray now than former - often asked and may be answered in a general way like this: 1 The market demands a better fruit. L'. There are more kinds c insect pests than formerly; they are also more numerous. I. Disease are more prevalent than formerly |)t only do we require better clothes, houses and live stock than did thers, but we also want better things to eat. The number of peo - 10 want and can pay for first-class fruit is growing larger each It then behooves the grower to produce only the best, for in this if fruit is the greatest profit. It is impossible to produce this kind pit in most sections without spraying. Therefore, spraying to a wake grower is as necessary as cultivation or pruning. The second reason that spraying is more imperative than it formerly was is due to the fact that in their struggle for existence our native fruit insects have been assisted either by the increased cultivation of their host plants or by the destruction of their natural enemies.

Certain of our improved varieties may be less hardy than formerly because the quality of disease resistance may have been sacrificed for other desirable points by the plant bi » To be specific we ordinarily spray the apple in Nebraska for two asons: 1. To kill the codling moth. 2. To control the apple &amp;cab We will first consider the habits and life history of the apple worm or codling moth, which causes more damage to Nebraska apples each than do all other insects combined. The codling moth is commonly th of worminess in the apple. Nearly every one has been sur 1 at the pinkish white worm at his work near the core, and many Shave wondered where the voracious invader came from and whither at when his appetite was satisfied and his growth completed, hile we do not definitely know the original hcme of the codling moth, it is probably that of the apple. Although there are some re- stricted localities in which the apple is grown that are apparently not yet infested with the codling moth, it can be safely said that the moth is found practically wherever the apple is produced. The insect i&gt; tributed naturally by means of flight. As the moth is not naturally a strong flyer, the limit of distribution by this means is three or four miles in a single season. If then, an infested orchard is many miles re- moved from other orchards, as is often the case in the wset, it is neceo- to look for artificial means of distribution to explain the presence of the codling moth in that orchard. It is extremely probable that the insect Ktroduced into this country and since its introduction has been dis - d mainly by the shipping of affected fruit from the infested regions ie previously uninfested. In this way the insect may be carried destruction of its natural enw. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">of miles in a single year. The spread is accomplish - follows: Fruit containing caterpillars of the codling moth is packed in barrels or boxes and in time, as the worms mature, they crawl from their home to seek a sheltered place to spin their cacoons and p . l'nder the above-described rlrrnnnt»nc&gt; ■ they spin their cacooi km, crevices and corners of the shipping cases. If these in; - cases are located near an apple orchard when the moths emerge the establishment of a codling moth colony in that orchard is assured. In Nebraska there are two broods of the codling moth per year, with ily a partial third brood present some seasons. The eggs of the codling moth are, in shape, a flattened oval, and in size, that of a pin head When first laid, they present a pearly white appearance, but later on as the embryo develops they become yellowish in color. The ■ rood eggs are laid on the leaves about three weeks aftr the fallen and hatch in five to ten days, depending on the weather young worm is at first white in color about one-sixteenth of an inch long and has a shiny black head. Its first meal is sometimes made from the tender leaves, but mure often the healthy youngster begins at oni hearty meal on the apple itself, and seeks immediately the core and seeds, the most nutritious i&gt;art of the apple. To begin his work he must find :ilyx or some other depression on the surface of the apple. In ah about 9'J'&lt; of the first generation enter the fruit at the calyx, the remain - ing 10' making their entrance from the stem or side of the apple. The ous feeder loses no time in his work, and at the end of three \&gt; attained his growth and by that time has excavated an exit tunnel to the side of the fruit, although in some instances the full grown . leaves the fruit by its entrance route through the calyx or n a tunnel to the stem end. The depredations of its tenant generally cause the apple to full, al - though it is by no means rare for the fruit to persist on the tree. The pillar, now full grown, crawls from its home, seeks a sheltered and there spins its cocoon of white silk. The common location of the codling moth cocoons is under lose bark, in knot holes and in ca and crevices in the tree. If the apple tree is young and smooth Ik the caterpillar simply utilizes the most sheltered place available, which may be rubbish under the tree or lumber supported by it, in which take those wonderful transformations by which the crawling caterpillar anged to the winged moth. This process in the case of the codling takes about two weeks. The moths, within a few days of their emergence from the cocoon lay their eggs on the leaves and fruit eggs soon hatch and the young caterpillars mature as do those el the urood. l/iilili,' many of our common moths, the sexes of the eodliBg are vuy similar in general appearance, a more than supei I'nless they are very abundant, the moths are not usually noticed in the orchards, as they spend the larger part of their lives resting on the bark of the trees on which they are rendered inconspicuous by their color. </seg>
            <seg id="p065">of the codling moth are many and various, but altogether they do not control the pest especially in those districts where there are two broods of the insect. The woodpecker is the most important of nai enemies to the apple worm. So thorugh in his work is this feathered ally of the fruit grower that it is often difficult in the spring to find living arvae of the codling moth except in those places that are absolutely in- ■-able to Mr. Woodpecker. Beside the woodpecker and other bird* there are many predaceous and parisitic invertebrate enemies of the ■d'ing moth but as a whole their work in subduing the pest is of com- ively little importance.

I am afraid, however, that my sub - entirely too big to do it justice in the short time that I have at imand.

Its work has to do with almost phase of farm life, and if I were to underake to describe the work whole Department including all its bureaus I am afraid I would h.iw- to stay here until six o'clock tonight, and I am sure you don't want to be imposed upon to that extent. I will take up only two of the great the Department and refer in the very best way I can to the work that is being done by them, — some of the work that is being done by the government at Washington to aid the farmer The first bureau that I want to speak of is the Bureau of Animal In- dustry, which was established in the year 1878. The first appropriation, B, that was ever allowed for this kind of work was made that year, • ■ work begun. The first work was a study of animal diseases. took up the study of such diseases as black leg, pleuro-pneu- B, etc., wheih had been working such havoc among the live stock rs of the country. And this study and work has been progressing in in that day to this. The Department has practically eliminated the black-leg among cattle, which in the earlier years was supposed to be responsible for about fifty per cent of the loss in cattle, until now among the live stock growers of the country the loss is less than ten per Pleuro-pneumonia too has also been stamped out by the work of the Department and many oth«r diseases have been entirely extermi- 1.

The Government is coi v now found a remedy for this Texas r. Last year the Department Agriculture appropriation for fight- Is disease was $150,000 and this year it is $2,000,000. The United Department has established down there what is known as the Line," running clear from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the border here Texas Fever begins. They are gradually getting control of sease and are forcing this dead line south as fast as pe &gt; one of the greatest and most important undertakings that the iment is carrying on at the present time. Another important question that the Government is engaged in trying to work out is that of hog cholera. The study of this disease was begun in 1878 at the time the first appropriation was allowed, and from that time until this the work has been carried on by the Government and the different Experiment stations of the various states all over the country. Congress has been more liberal in these things than our state legislatures and for that reason they have been doing a lot more practical work. This has now reached the point where they have found a remedy for this disease. When Dr. Melvin announced that they had found a cure for bog cholera 1 knew it must be so. Dr. Melvin is not a radical or assertive man at all, but one of the most conservative men I have ever known, and therefore it seems that there is no question but what they have discovered a remedy for this disease. Now I don't want to give out the impression that they can go into a herd of hogs that have the cholera and save every one of them, but I do say that they can take a herd where the cho! - just breaking out and save from 85 to i&gt;~&gt; per cent of those hogs. And if they can do that it It worth millions of dollars to the farmers of this country. When I took up with this work here in Nebraska I was criticised ime for taking up with a matter that did not have any merit in it, but now that succe- red in combating this long dreaded disease I think the people should know about it. I gave out a statement to the effect that the Department would have a representative call at any place ■where he was wanted. To be sure this is a pretty big affair, but the </seg>
            <seg id="p071">U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Tl Department always has men ready to be sent out on short notice. To show the success of the plan, — Mr. Grinstead, up at Salem, had some hogs affected with cholera. A man went to look at them and saw at once that they were too far gone to be saved. Mr. Grinstead went to one of his neighbors and bought eight shoats, where there was no cholera. He took them to his home, and had four of them inoculated and the other four were not inoculated. He put them all into the pens where the hogs had been dying and in with the sick hogs that were sleeping there in the pens. The four hogs that were inoculated are still living, while the four that were not inoculated all died. Now this is merely one instance of the suc - cess of the plan. The same results are accomplished in many other places. I mention these matters simply to show you what the Department at Washington is doing for the people of the United States. I might go ahead and speak of the matter of inspection of a— &lt;■■ matter was first taken up in 1890, and the first law that was passed upon this subject related simply to cured meats In 1891 laws were made to apply to all kinds of meats, and in 1906 the Meat Inspection Act was passed. That bill provides for inspection of all meat that goes into interstate or foreign commerce. That law is so worded that in effect the Government inspects all the treat that is consumed by our people, whether interstate or whether confined to state commerce. As a matter of fact the effect is that there is a very rigid inspection of all meats that are used in thf entire United States. Congress is approprating annually for this matter of meat inspection $3,000,00* and which is known to be the bes' every piece of this meat that is ir The best meat that is consumed bears the Government stamp .and lected bears this stamp, which is Government's guarantee that that piece of meat i« pure and whole- some and absolutely free from disease of any kind. All the meat that is for family use In the cities and towns, whether you get it from Omaha, Kansas City or Saint Joe, you will notice bears the Government stamp of inspection and this signifies that it is all righ think now that I have said enough, or at least as much as I am war- ranted in saying with the limited amount of time that I have, on this sub- ject of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and the other bureau that I want to discuss is the Bureau of Plant Industry. This is another of the many bureaus of the United States Department of Agriculture. The work of the Bureau of Plant Industry has to do with all the features of plant life It includes the division of soils and all other divisions and bureaus whose work relates to plant life. This Bureaus of Plant Industry was establish- ed as a separate bureau in the year 1900, and the work of this bureau has been of inestimable value to the farmers of this country In the first place, the Department of Agriculture was organized dur- ing the War of the Rebellion, in 1862. It has grown from year to year jntil now the estimated value to the country of the work of this depart- ment is over $60,000,000.

When I became a member of th Agricultural Committee on« of the things that impressed me most wa that more provision should be made for getting all this information to the poeple. The people of the country should have the benefit of it. The Government is carrying on investigations in other lines of work, and all of these there is abundant information for the farmer, but he not get all the benefit from it that he should. If the farmer of the country rw of the results that could be accomplished by the recommendations the Government they could increase the yield of their corn from ty to fifty per cent, they could increase the yield of their wheat from ten to forty per cent every year And I want to say in conclusion, that I hope the people of Richard County, whenever they get the opportunity, will help the farmer this country by getting for them the advice and counsel of the men from this great Department of Agriculture, and help them to inerea; their farm production, to get more out of it, and help to make easier thei declining days of life.

Assistant State Entomologist Two years ago the writer presented to the Nebraska State Horti - cultural Society a report on the injurious insects of the biennium 19' viewed from the standpoint of the horticulturist, and this paper waa published as Bulletin 19 of the Society and later reprinted in the Annual report of the Society for 1908, pages 141-158. In the present paper the intention is to deal similarly with the insect pests of fruits, shade trees and ornamentals which have come to the notice of the Entomologist and his assistant during the two years extending from April 1, 1908, to April 1, 1910. Only the species not considered in detail in the former report will be amplified upon in this one, since the reader can secure information upon those pests previously discussed by simply refering back to the preceding volumes, thus avoiding useless repetition. General Summarj of Insect Injuries. The codling moth (Ciirporapou pomonellui, which was quite fully discussed in the last report, continued to be a great pest in the apple orchards during the two seasons here under discussion. In some orch - ards where the crop was an almost complete failure in 1907-08, the 1909 crop was said to be somewhat less severely injured than normally, this being possibly due to a partial starving out of the pest in limited areas. On the whole, however, the 1909 crop was about as severely attacked as ever in orchards where scientific spraying was not practiced. Some small unsprayed orchards which came under the observation of the writer contained scarcely a perfectly sound apple in the entire orchard, owing to the attack of the apple worms and scab. The plum cruculio (Conotrarhelus nenuphar) forms a close second </seg>

Dillman of Trenton, it 11, 1909, four died of parasitic infestation. This would seem to te that this insect is being taken care of quite satisfactorily by its te and is unlikely to again prove injurious during 1910. The lillar, its cocoon, pupa and moth and its work on the apple foliage lown in the accompanying plate (Plate 2); also its parasite and a tized larva (Plate 3, figure a). In some of the orchards near Lincoln during the middle of July 1909 the apple trees were rather severely attacked by the apple-leaf skeletonizer (Cnnarsln hammondl), defoliations by this pest in some cases involving most of the large branches of the trees, nearly every leaf being attacked by a larva. By early August most of these had transformed into pupae and the moths began emerging on the eleventh of that month. No evidence of parasitism was encountered in our breeding cage work with this insect, and it is not unlikely it may prove injurious again during the coming season as during 1909. Some idea of the character of the work of this insect may be gained by examining the plate illustrating an attacked branch and leaf and the pupa and moth of the insect itself (Plate 4.) The year 1908 was attended by serious defoliation of cultivated cherry and plum and also wild plum by the apple-tree tent-caterpillar (Malarosoma americana) in several sections of the state, notably in Madison and Frontier counties. The injury began in latter April and continued through May. As this insect was fully discussed in last year's report it will not be discussed further here. A species of leaf - beetle, Typophorus eanellug, was found abundantly in an apple orchard at West Point in early May 1908, where it injured the trees by eating hole* in the leaves, especially those of the lower branches. This insect, al - though known to attack the raspberry and crab apple commonly, has not to my knowledge been before recorded as being present in apple orchards by the thousand and injuring the foliage of the trees as was true in this case.

The snowy tree cricket (Oeranthu* niteuM was found to have extensively injured the raspberries, black - berries and grapes in several fruit farms in the- vicinity of Florence in 1908. Many of the canes of blackberry and raspberry were dead and filled with the tree criket eggs for nearly their entire length, some - actually containing hundreds of these eggs. One fruit grower estimated his loss because of this insect at over DM.90 during the preceding year During middle .May of IMS the mulberry trees in certain localities Lincoln were more or less injured by the work of the larva of a Cerambycid beetle I Idirrluix-licnia Hlteriiutnm i which in some trees was so abundant as to cause their death. More will be said of this borer on a succeeding page. Among the enemies of coniferous trees there are several which came to our notice during 19uS and 1909. The pine-leaf scale (Chlonn-pU pinifoliiiei was reported as seriously infesting both pine and spruce during both years. In June 1909 the pine tree s&lt;?ale was reported from Geneva as injuring Black Hill spruce in that town. In July 1909 the writer investigated a rather seriuos outbreak of one of the pine tip moths, I ratrin iriislrjiim i among the jack pines and Bcoteh pines in the Dismal River Forest R*MTT« n-ar Halsey.

Over mose of this area the trees had been similary attacked the previous year and to a lesser ex- tent during 1906 also. The abundance of the insects caused the issuance of Circular No. 1 of the office of State Entomologist which discussed its habits and means of control quite fully. During 1909 there was no trouble with this insect anywhere in the state. During May of 1908 there was also some damage by the cottony maple scale (Pnlvinaria Innnmerahilta) in Lancaster, Thayer and Franklin counties on maple, boxelder and hack- berry trees, bu the damage was neither severe nor extensive and com- pletely disappeared during 1909.

Instances c&lt; rather serious prevelance of this pest -were reported from Gage. Adams and Sherman counties during July and August of both seasons. The ash borer (Trochilium fraxinl) injured this tree in several localities, notably about Hastings and Alliance. The black locust trees in certain parts of southwestern Nebraska were injured by a borer, probably Cyllene roblniae, during 1908. Among the insect enemies ol garden flowers one of the most de - structive was the pea louse (»ctiirophorn destructor), which during both raara greatly injured the sweet peas in several localities in eastern Nebraska. Red spider proved another prolific source of injury on sweet peas. Snow-ball bushes in northern Nebraska were injured by the snow - ball louse (Aphis rirbarni) while during July 1908 the sumac louse (Rhopaloslphnm rhois) occurred in destructive abundance upon that plant in the vicinity of Lincoln. There were instances of asparagus ferns being injured by the asparagus scale (Aspidlotus hederae). The verbenas at the University Farm were severely injured during latter August of 1909 by a small lepidopterous larva working in the tips of the stems. This larva was reared, but its species has not been determnied nor has its life-history been worked out. The Peach-Tree Borer— iSniiiiiiuii exitosu Say). This insect is one of the most important of our Nebraska horticultural pests, and, next to the plum curculio, is probably the most injurious insect enemy of the stone fruits in this state. The pest is one indiginous to the American continent and has been counted as a formidable enemy of the peach for over a century. Originally it worked upon the various kinds of wild cherries and plums in its habitat, but at the present time is thought of almost entirely in connection with its attack on cultivated varieties. It occurs at the present time over all of the eastern United States west of the Rocky Mountians. Iie workings of the larvae of this insect just below the bark about ises of peach, cherry and plum trees causes the exudation of a colored gum, which enables the ready detection of the injury, irvae mine about just below the bark, often girdling the trees, and r are present in numbers will quickly cause their death. Quite ntly, too, the larvae may be found burrowing about the bases of the branches, especially of the older trees. The peach tree borer is a single brooded insect. Its parent is a very handsome, dark blue, slender-bodied moth which in the female has a broad orange band on the middle of the abdomen. This moth belongs to the family of clear-winged moths (Sesslidae) which are remarkable for the fact that the wings are more or less denuded of the customary covering of colored scales, so that they appear transparent. The female moth has only the hind wings thus clear, and is about an inch and a </seg>

The peach-tree borer is an exceedingly hard insect to successfully imbat. Among the most successful preventives are the various means mployed to prevent the moths laying their eggs about the bases of the young trees. Some mound up earth to the height of a foot or so about the bases of the trees early in June and keep it thus for the next three months, this method being particularly adapted to the protection of nursery stock. On other trees it is often possible to employ somewhat more elaborate and efficient protections such as tightly wrapping the base of the tree with heavy roofing or sheathing paper and seeing that this extends for an inch or two below the level of the soil, or any other method which will prevent the larva gaining access to the base of the tree. Another preventive is the application of poisoned limy coats to the lower trunk of the tree to prevent the laying of eggs and the entrance of the larva. A wash made of two quarts of strong soap and an ounce or two of Paris green with a little carbolic acid added, and these mixed in a bucket full of water with enough lime to make a paste, has proved satisfactory for this purpose. The small amount of poison included will not injure the trees, but no more than above mentioned should be used and this only with lime. Mixtures containing more arsenic will inevit - ably injure peach trees. Other substances which have proved success - ful as preventives of injury by this insect under certain conditions of environment, under different conditions have proved ineffective or injured the trees, so need not be further mentioned here. Ethe larvae have located under the bark of the trees, ordinarily means of destroying them is by simply digging them out with a ife, which is, in the end, the most effective treatment at this .fter some experience this digging out can be done very rapidly out serious injury to the tree. It can be done to best advantage le early spring when the borers are most easily located and are half in extent of wings; the male moth has both wings clear and is distinctly smaller than the female. These moths appear in late June or early July and lay their eggs upon the bark of the tree, usually near the ground, but in some cases in the crotches. The egg is exceedingly small ■if a yellowish brown color, lmmediatly upon its hatching, which takes place, the tiny larva actively crawls about and soon burrows into .the bark by entering through a crack. It mines down to the sap- Kat or sometimes below the level of the outside soil in young trees, out the base of the limbs in older trees, growing during the er and early fall and meanwhile enlarging its burrows and causing laracteristic exudations of sap mixed with wood dust and dirt. When winter arrives the larva ceases feeding and remains dormant through the cold weather, resuming its burrowing and feeding the next spring and completing its growth at that time. The full growth is reached toward the middle of June. When full grown the larva is about an inch long, yellowish-white with the head and segment just behind it </seg>

These holes are formed by the parent beetles in entering the bark to deposit their eggs and by the newly formed beetles which have developed under the bark in emerging for the purpose of dissemination among the trees of the orchard. They may be found, not only in plum. cherry and peach, but also in the apple and pear and other trees. In king stone fruit trees there is likely to be an exudation of gum at ■oles. The insect causing this injury is a small beetle about one-tenth of n inch long, in color black, with the tips of the wing-covers and part I legs dull red. It belongs to the family of bark beetles (Scolj tidjie I a native of Europe. It was first observed in this country injuring B 1 s.77 and within a few years established itself over all of the east of the Rocky mountains from New England, New and Michigan, south to Georgia, Alabama and Arkansas. This insect Is particularly likely to attack trees after they have been • d by the peach-tree borer or through some other cause, and it may be said that as a rule the attack by these bark-beetles is confined to ind injured trees. But sometimes perfectly sound tree - iy attacked and sometimes seriously injured by the fruit-tree bark-beetle. Peach trees in full vitality are likely to repel the beetles by the abundant gummy exudations, so that they soon desert their burrows and seek other trees, but when the vitality of the tree is lowered so that copious exudations cease a heavy attack and early death of the la likely to follow. The beetles early in the spring burrow into the small terminal twigs, causing their death and the wilting of the leaves .ear. The first beetles make their appearance quite early in the spring, when they crawl about over the orchard trees and penetrate through the bark into the sapwood. The female beetle then forms in the bark and adjacent wood a large vertical brood gallery from one-half to two inches in length, and along the sides of this she constructs many little side pockets in which she lays her eggs. The construction of this gallery is completed in less than a week. Within three days these eggs hatch </seg>

These lateral galleries increasing in bore with the growth of the larvae, and about eighty of them are produced by the progeny of each female. In about twenty days the young larvae have reached maturity, and form in the wood at the end of the gallery an oval chamber and there go into the pupal stage. A week or ten days later the beetles burrow out directly through the bark forming one of the "shot holes" previously mentioned. The development of the brood therefore requires from four to six weeks. Two or possibly three of such broods are produced annually, the insect remaining over winter within its chamber under the bark in the beetle, larva or egg stage. Because of the fact that this insect continues breeding through the entire season, that it occurs over all portions of the tree and that it is exceedingly abundant, the use of such preventives as mentioned for the peach-tree borer lose much of their value when applied against this species. Wrappings of paper about the trunk and limbs will of course, prevent the insect burrowing in at these points while the application of different deterrent washes also in a measure protects the treated tree. Soft soap dissolved in water and soda until of the oap mixed with crude carbolic acid in water ency of pa at the rate of one gallon of soap to one pint of acid in eight gallons of should be applied thoroughly with a brush, and as much of the hould be covered with it. For effective protection as pc ■t be periodically renewed, the first application being made with 3t warm days of spring. Moreover, these applications will not : injury to the twigs and the smaller branches. But after all, the principal means against this insect is the practice of clean culture. Allowing pruned branches and brush wood to accum - ulate.about the orchards or allowing infested trees which are dying from attack to remain in the orchard, serve to form an abundance of choice breeding material and prove centers of infestation for the other tree*. Trees only slightly attacked should be protected from further injury by the means above described but trees dying from the attack of this or other insects or any disease should be cut out and burned at once. This will discourage the pest by creating a dearth of food material and forc - ing it to attack healthy trees, which as we have seen, it prefers not to do. By keeping the trees in the best possible condition they will then be enabled to withstand this comparatively light attack, especially where the affected trees are protected by the above mentioned washes. The Grape-berry Moth — lEudemis botranu Schiff) The grape-berry moth is an insect which has been imported into America from southern Europe, and at the present time occurs over most of the United States where grapes are grown to any extent. Here In Nebraska It has become seriously injurious only within recent years. Injury by this insect Is noticeable when the grapes berries begin to </seg>
            <seg id="p110">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 110 ripen. When many of them show discolored spots and the berries them - selves become shrunken, an examination of these injured fruits will re - ' :ie presence of a small whitish larva which has burrowed through the pulp from the original discolored spot. The attack may involve also the seeds of the grape. These larvae may pass from one berry to another spinning silken strands between the attacked berries as they do so and causing the exudation of the juices of the fruit. The general appearance of the injury is much like that produced by the disease known as black he larva becomes full grown it turns darker in color, assuming a deep greenish or biownish hue. Then it leaves the grape, and, migrat - ing to a leaf, cuts out a little flap in the graps leaf which it folds over and fastens with silk, thus forming a little pocket in which it transforms Into the pupa stage. In ten or twelve days a small slate colored moth with reddish brown markings emerges from this leaf pocket and soon -commences depositing egsss for the next brood of larvae. This applies to the second and third broods of the insect, which develop on the green grapes in July and on the ripening grapes in August and September. The first brood i.f this insect is usually quite small and produces no obvious barm, so that usually no protective measures are taken against it, but In the second and third broods Ihe insect multiplies very rapidly and may become very numerous and destructive In the pockets it has formed through early in the spring, which depo- The last brood of larvae remains the winter and gives forth moths to form the first brood of the next The grape-berry moth attacks all varieties of grapes but especially the tender skinned sorts which form dense bunches. Aside from grapes It may breed in the seed bunches of sumac and in tulip and magnolia leaves. Instances of the destruction of one-half to three quarters of a grape crop by this insect have occured in several grape growing regions of the eastern United States. The chief means of controlling the grape-berry moth, especially In the larger vineyards is to promptly collect and burn all the fallen leaves and badly injured fruit in the fall, thus destroying the hibernating brood of larvae and pupae. Early gathering and shipping of the fruit removes the larvae from the vineyards before they have left the berries and located In the leaves. The destruction of the fallen fruit is also helpful. The practice of bagging the grape cluster as soon as the fruit has set is an adequate protection against this insect and also against the black rot of the grape. Spraying is useful only against the first brood, which develops on the leaves and tendrils of the vine, and, owing to the small numbers of this brood and its probable diffusion upon other plants beside the grape, the value of this treatment is largely offset.

The infested trees were carefully examined and it was found that about thirty-five per cent of the new tips were affected by this insect and practically all of them dead and brown. The affected trees were in the older grove just south of the reserve buildings, where the jack pines were about six feet high and all the smaller scotch pines were scattered among them. Both species of pine were apparently equally affected by the insects. The injury tirst became manifest to the supervisor on the last day of June, when the excessive exudations of resin and rapidly browning needles of the tips of the shoots became rather conspicuous. Later these dead needles dropped. The larvae causing the damage would burrow in the stems for one to three inches, usually pupating near the tip and later emerging therefrom, after the pupa had partly pushed its way out. Sometimes, however, the point of attack was located an inch or two below the tip in which case the tip became brown and curled and the moth emerged from the sides. On Plate 13 this moth and its injuries are illustrated. Pi July 12 most of the moths emerged from the tips and were about among the pines. Several would often be found in a single ear the tips of the branches.

For cottonwood, however, it has accquired an exceeding fondness, and frequently occurs in excessive abundance upon this tree, where it works great destruction. As early as 1878 the tremendous .ictive ability of this beetle upon the cottonwood was brought forcibly to notice in Kansas and Nebraska, and again in 1884 it was ex - ceddingly injurious in Nebraska and South Dakota. As noted on a preceding page the last two years have been marked by much defoliation by this insect, and its close relative the spotted willow leaf-beetle, (Linn Inpponicu i. These insects spend the winter as adult beetles. In early spring as the cottonwoods and poplars commence putting out their leaves the female beetles deposit their eggs on the under side of the leaves in masses of a few to a hundred eggs. The larvae which soon hatch from these eggs are black in color, and first skeletonize the leaf upon which the eggs were laid and then gradually diffuse over the tree as they grow older. With each successive molt they grow lighter in color, so that when full grown they are about three-eights of an inch long, yellowish white with black legs and rows of tubercles upon the back and sides, some of which emit an exceedinly pungent milky liquid. They attach themselves to the leaf and go into the pupa stage, soon thereafter giving forth the adult beetles. As only two weeks are re - quired during midsummer for the entire development from egg to adult, this species is enabled to complete four or five broods annually, in - creasing in abundance and destructiveness as the season advances. Ehe adult beetle of serlpta is exceedingly variable with its markings, Bually the thorax is black bordered on each side with yellow, and the covers yellowish marked with broken lines of black. The beetle of nica is of a reddish brown color usually heavily sppotted with . The larvae of the two species are so similar as to be practically inguishable. The willow leaf-beetle, however, as its name indicates, newhat more partial to the foliage of the willow. The life-history ripta above given is essentially true with lapponira also. The most effective means of combating both these important shade tree pests is a thorough spraying with arsenical poisons. But the results are not always entirely satisfactory. The smooth leaf surface especially of the willow causes the spray to tend to collect in drops and roll from the foliage, also the habit of the beetles and grubs of feeding on the under surface of the leaves to a considerable extent makes it difficult to lodge the poison effectively. The best results are to be obtained by a heavy application of arsenate of lead at the rate of two pounds to fifty gallons of water, early in the season before the beetles get much of a start. This application must be renewed as necessary from time to time during the summer, but the adhesiveness of the lead arsenate makes very frequent reapplications unnecessary. In some places the shaking off and collecting in kerosene troughs of the beetles and larvae has been successfully practiced, somewhat after the manner used in jarring for the plum curculio. "Phis is, however, too laborious and expensive to admit of very general practice. </seg>

It is the object of this paper not only to give some of the principles of parasitism but to give a discussion of its extent and efficiency as well as a brief description of the groups of insects involved. Ke will not consider predaceous insects, parasites of mamma. ternal or exo-parasites which the more popular definition might ex- But as here used, "parasitism" denotes the relationship which between rertain insects, called "parasites," which live, during rtain insects, called "parasites," which live, during some stage of their developement, within the bodies or eggs of otti insects or "hosts." The lives of most insects are divided into four distinct sta - periods: the egg stage; the larval or "worm" stage during which they do all of their growing; the pupa or resting stage during which tl, sects remain inactive, take no food, and are undergoing the transforma - tion from the larval to the last or adult stage. The grasshoppers, katy - dids, the true bugs such as "stink-bugs," and some other groups do not have the pupal stage but remain active throughout life, reaching ma by a steady process of growth. Parasitism is not confined to any one of these stages. Some parasites attack the egg, others the larva, while still others choose the pupa or adult M hosts. It is to be noted, ho . that parasites which attack the eggs never molest the larvae. With few exceptions the work of each kind of parasite is confined to a particular stage of the host.

While the eggs have their , largely coflned to the one group of family of insects, the larvae M fortunate, for their enemes are much more numerous and greatly in habi's and general appearance. Two large divisions are represented: The two- winged insects or Diptera which are properly called flies, and four-winged insects or H&gt; nienoptera, some of which i commonly be mistaken for small dark colored bees while others superficially resemble the long bodied wasps Eie parasitic flies are divided into four groups which may be recog - without much difficulty. The large group is composed of flies lachlnidiii- and are the hardest to distinguish from their close M such as the house-fly, blow-flies, and flesh-flies. These charac - owever. are sufficient to identify the group, namely: The presence R or many spines scattered over the body, and the bristles on the nnt'Tinae or "feelers" which are bare instead of feathev-like. A second group, llexfiilae, closely resembles the Tacliinidae and these flies may be distinguished by usually having longer and more slender legs and the bristles ol the antennae being feather-like. The members of these groups which are destructive to moths and butterflies choose the larvae as hosts, never attacking the eggs or adults and seldom, if over, the pupae. The egg is deposited on the skin &lt;&gt;r hair of the caterpillar to which it is :&gt;ed by a viscous fluid. When it hatches the little worm bort way beneath the skin of the host. If the young parasite were to feed upon the vital parts of the caterpillar, the host would soon die and the body completely dry up long before the parasite reached maturity, but there is a wisdom which prompts the parasite to feed only on the fatty tsaaues of the body. This does not seem to greatly discommode the caterpillar which continues to eat and produce tissue for the little guest. only when the parasite becomes almost full grown that the cater - pillar ceases to eat and begins to sicken and die. The larva c.f the parasite may leave the caterpillar and burrow in the ground or crawl to some protected place and there pupate, or it may pupate within the body of the host. In either case the caterpillar never recovers.

Tn this case the caterpillar may spin its cocoon and even pupate before the parasite develops, but, as stated before, the host never, except possibly in very rare cases, raches the adult stage.

They are flies which are short and robust, usually with a thick covering of hair which gives them a downy appearance. The wings of many are beautifully mottled with brown or black.

Their method of pupation may be of two kinds, namely, external pupation where the larvae come outside of the caterpillar before entering the resting stage, and internal pupation where the larvae remain within the caterpillar in order to complete their development. Those which follow the first named method, that of external pupation, feed upon the fatty tissues of the host much the same as do other parasites. When parasites are full grown they worm their way through the skin on the back of the caterpillar until they are entirely outside except just enought of the tail to hold them sticking out perpendicular to the' body of the host. Each of the larvae bends its head over and secures itself with a sticky fluid at the place of attachment then proceeeds to spin a cocoon about itself.

            <seg id="p135">135 have been discussed and there being no new items of special interest, we may pass to the consideration of the parasites of adult or mature While in the larval and pupal stage the insects are largely unpro- II and fall easy prey to the designing parasites, thus is not the caw the adult nsects. As a rule the mature insect is much more active apable of self-protection. In addition to this the hairy covering of the and the large wings of our moths and butterflies serve as complete protection, to that none of these are parasitized. In the case of the beetles the body is covered by shields or hard wing-covers which, with few exceptions, serve as efficient armor.

            <seg id="p136">136 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The to called "Thick-headed Flies" or Conopldae do not resemble any of the two-winged insects already mentioned. As their name signifies, they have exceptionally wide heads, considerably wider than the body; the body without bristles and usually without hair; the abdomen club - shaped, i. e., narrowed at the base, sometimes quite wasp-like. These insects are parasitic upon adult bees and wasps. The egg is laid directly upon the host while in flight, and the young larva, when it hatches, burrows within the body of the insect taking up a position with its head towards the rear end of the host. The larva pupates within the host, when the adult emerges it escapes by eating its way out. The attack of these insects is not confined to the bees and wasps, but some are also parasitic on grasshoppers upon which they work in ■ very similar manner. Of the four-winged insects only the Braeoalda are to any parasitic on adult insects. Often one of our little "lady-birds" or lady - bug" may be seen clinging to leaf, dead. On looking beneath the beetle there is seen a little silken cocoon of a Braconid which has issued frum the body of the host in order to go into the resting stage. It will be remembered that when other members of this group attacked the larvae there were many parasites to each host, and they all spun cocoons on the back of host or within the body. Here, however, there i.s only one parasite to each host. Another example of these parasites attacking adult insects is the parasitism of plant-lice. Comstock says that it is very interesting to watch these little Braconids ovipositing in the bodies of plant-lice. When one has selected a plant-louse in which to oviposit she stands with her head towards it. and bending her abdomen under her thorax between her legs she darts her ovipositor forward into th. of the plant-louse. These parasites do not construct cocoons, liut underg K stages within the dry skins of the plant-lice. When the ;idult te emerges it cuts a circular lid in the back of the host. O: lid is left attached, and one may often find the skins of whole colonies of plant-lice with these little round holes in their back- There is still a small group of parasitic insects which has not !ie&lt;-n Ened but which are very interesting from the fact that they are »o y different from the forms which we have been considering. The have four wings but the front pair are only slender, leathery, club - apprendeges. while the hind pair are very large and fan-shaped, males have no wings a t all and greatly resemble a larva in form. They are parasitic upon bees and wasps and it is in the bodies of these insects that they pass their pupal stage. The name Strep&gt;.ipteni is applied to this strange group of insects. While the relation between parasite and host as it has been discussed Emple one, it is by no means the whole story of parasitism. These •y parasites, feeding upon the tissues of their host, may in turn be ized by what are called secondary parasites. These secondary :es may also be victimized by tertiary parasites and, in very rare </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 circumstances, there may be even quartenary parasites. This relation - ship is well illustrated by the parasites of the larvae of the the White - marked Tussock Moth which is very common on shade trees in our cities and towns. The caterpillar may be parasitized by Amorphota orgjbe which is one of the Ichneumons as is shown by its club-shaped abdomen and its sting-like ovipositor. The larva of this parasite lives within the caterpillar until the entire body has been devoured. The larva then leaves the skin of the caterpillar and spins an oval cocoon within which it enters the pupal stage. At this time one of the Chalcids (Spiloekalete debills) which, it will be remembered, have elbowed antennae and heavy hind legs, comes along and "stings" the cocoon laying an egg in the body of the Ichneumon pupa. When the food supply is exhausted, the larva spins its cocoon within the other cocoon. Dlbruchys boorheunus another one of the Chalcids now lays an egg within these cocoons. This insect pupates without spinning a cocoon. The pupa of this parasite fall a prey to a little Chalcid called Asecodes ulbitursis. Hence the leaves, used by the caterpillar to build up its own body, were successive - ly transformed into four other Insects, for none of these parasites partook of any food save that which was in the original caterpiller. The importance of the part played by parasites in controlling the In - crease of injurious insects may be made more clear by a discussion of some of our common pests. In 1895 the White-marked Tussock Moth, already mentioned, threatened to become a plague in Washington, D. C. during the latter part of August and the early part of September almost every poplar, soft maple, box elder, elm, elder, birch, and willow in the was completely defoliated, while other trees were badly damaged. Somewhat later in the fall Dr. Howard, U. S. Entomologist, found that about 90% of the caterpillars were parasitized. Nevertheless, the 10* which survived produced enough so that next spring there were large numbers of the caterpillars. At this time Dr. Howard gathered (24 cocoons. From these only 12 moths emerged while there were 916 para - sites of which only 64 were primary. In other words parasites destrayed M% of the larvae. A month later it was almost impossible to find any larvae when the year before at the same time there had been thousand*.

B though these and countless other injurious insects are held in in their native home by their individual parasites, for, as a rule, larasite has its particular host and will attack no other unless i closely related form, we sometimes have an insect, which in its Euntry was never considered dangerous, brought nto a new country, ; its parasitic enemies behind.

Last year, ureau of Entomology, over one mil funds were expended in fighting the e tiacts of land have been rendered almost uninhabitable by hordes of these insects. Although artificial methods have been employed and proven of great value still they have not been able to keep up with the increase of the insects. Leading En - tomologists recognize that they must depend largely upon parasites, and Liuently parasitized caterpillars from the native European home of the moths are being shipped in by the wagon loads in the hopes of getting seme of the parasites established. Every precaution is taken to prevent secondary parasites form escaping and destroying the beneficial parasites. It was due to the great care which our nurserymen constantly exercise with the aid of Professor Bruner that the Brown-tail Moth is not started in our State. This spring winter-webs containing live caterpillars were fonnd on nursery stock shipped here from France, the home of the Brown-tail. While the parasites may do much, and Entomologists may do much. Entomologists, parasites, Agricultu lists, and Horticulturists must all combine forces as friends in order to successfully combat our insect enemies. </seg>

Forest Service has follewed the practice ablisning forest nurseries as rapidly as warrantable on various al Forests, where forest planting is an important project At d of last year, there were twenty-four such nurseries which were ted to have an annual capacity of approximately 9,000,000 seedlings, lursery, of about ten acres, is located at Halsey, Nebraska, naining nurseries are widely scattered throughout thi e for the most part of comparatively small area. I luring the month of January. 1907, the Forest Service deemed it ible to hold a conference of the men in charge of various nurersies established. The principle nurseries at that time were located in i8ka, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and California. The basis for illowing material was deduced from this planting conference but is emented largely by the writer's experience at government and :e nurseries. It should be borne in mind that nursery methods at the various stations have been widely different because they are located on wildely variable sites. Results from one nursery are often only of general value In comparsion with those from another and scarcely at all comparable with the practice at most commercial nurseries. The sites of the govern - ment nurseries vary from the hot sand hills of Nebraska to the cold mountain valleys of Utah and Colorado and to the warm valleys of California and New Mexico, in localities where forest nurseries have neve, baton beeu established. The soils vary from gravel at the nursey la I'tah through sandy loam at Halsey, Nebraska, and fine loam in Colorado and California, to an adobe soil in New Mexico. Many of the trees that are being propagated have never been grown extensively Kl nurseries with the exception of the one at Halsey, Nebraska, are ed largely to supply coniferous tree stock for planting on water - of men who have been in the work for several years and who le rank of forest planting assistant or some superior rank. i while the one at Halsey provides material for the afforesaid station sand-hill region of Nebraska. At each of the stations, the primary is to raise high class nursery stock suitable for planting in the iate region at a price cheaper than that quoted by commercial ies. The location of these stations in the center of large planting is especially advisable for the following reasons: 1. Such stock is usually better adapted to local conditions than Introduced stock. 2. Host of the stock has been much superior in grade to that which can be bought in the open market </seg>

The two general systems, high shade frames and low shade frames, have been tried with varying degrees of success. Where shading is necessarry for the entire growing season with little variation of light and heat, the high shade frame may be advisable. It has been held that such con - ditions obtain throughout certain portions of the southwest.

It is generally consid i ind wherever possible such posts in rows 8 to 12 feet apart each wa to lengthen their life. This is should be treated with preservative needed because of the large amount of artificial watering which is often necessary in forest nurseries and which tends to rot posts more rapidly than would otherwise be the case. Creosote paint, tar, charring, an charring with tar applied afterward have been used. Usually two by four stringers are used to connect the tops of the posts from north to south. Similar stringers may be run at right angles but are not usually considered of sufficient advantage to pay for the increased cost. Wires are used in place of the two by fours by some nurserymen being run at both right angles and diagonally in order to give sufficient strength. Overhead shading may be provided by machine woven lath. Building lath are connected by five double strands of woven wire and are spaced according to the amount of shading desired. In southern California a lath house was constructed in which the lath were nailed to two by fours and other smaller stringers overhead and on the exposed sides of the nur- series. The cost of the high shade frame system varies from $800 to $1500 per acre according to local conditions. The woven lath may be purchased at 40 to So cents per running yard according to closeness of bids and freight rates. Stripes of woven lath 180 to 20u feet long may be streched by the use of a windlass or a block and tackle. The disadvant- ages of the system consist of the high cost, impossibility of carying light and heat conditions, and the necessity of covering paths as well as beds. Small aspen poles have been used in place of lath in the high shade frame system in Colorado and brush is likewise used by some of the commercial nurseries. Peeled poles are desired as the falling bark inter - fores with the beds. This system furnishes irrugular shade and may be built much cheaper than when lath is used. Low shade frames, 12 to 24 inches above the seed beds, are usually constructed from lath and stringers smaller than two by fours. If these materials are not at hand in mountain regions one can Irequently induce a sawmill man to saw to order whatever may be needed. It is usually </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ■id that the low system is cheaper than the high system but in many the cost is fully as great. There is a great variety in the styles of low shade frames. In most nurseries the width of the screens is four feet with a length of 8 to 13 feet. However, the following sized screens are in use at large nurseries: feet by 4 feet, handled by one man 4 feet by 4 feet, handled by one man. 4 feet by 12 feet, made from woven fencing handled by two men. 4 feet by 16 feet, handled by two men. 4 feet by length of beds, made from woven lath which is rolled from one end to the other. Where there are strong winds or the screens are made of very light material, it is usually customary to fasten the screens with hinges, hooka and eys. Nearly every nursery has some variation in using this system. Some men leave spaces between two or more beds where the screens may be stacked: others leave open space at the ends cf beds; others pre - fer woven lath which may be rolled to the ends of long beds; still others prefer to set posts beside each bed to which the screens may be fastened. In windy regions, where it is desired to remove the entire shade frame, hooks and eyes should be used in place of bnges. Posts may be arranged so as to hold the screens from two beds. Soil Preparation. In many cases, the original nursery site was covered with native sod and underbrush. Sod land is preferred since underbrush land demands expensive clearing. Both types of land are usually free from noxious weeds. Occasionally, long cultivated areas are secured and such sites are usually in demand because of the soil unifomity, physically and chemically and because nursery operations may be started immediately. Deep, thorough stirring of the soil, somewhat similar to that in market gardening practice, is necessary. This can be dene by spading or plowing but the latter is usually prefered because of cheapness. Occa - sionally, plowing has been followed by spading where heavy soils are used. If high shade frames are used, plowing may be done except where posts interfere and the remaining area may then be spaded. Through pulverizing and leveling are essential to proper distribution of soil moisture, evenness In seed sowing and proper root development. Loose sols may require some packing while heavy soils should be as free fr^m packing as possible. •Seedbed Preparation. E nurseries are located on valuable soils, it is well to have as L proportion of the area in paths as possible and still not inter - th work in the seed-beds. It is also considered advisable to allow ler path in open or low shade frames nurseries than in high shade nurseries. Even when paths are as small as possible, they will copy ten to fifteen per cent of the area. Acenter path, running </seg>

When nurseries are iished on slight or moderate slopes, the beds are leveled and boards ilaced along the lower sides t oprevem washing. Such boards are used in some nurseries on level land. In cases where flooding occurs during the rainy season, as it does in southern California, it was the practice to use the paths to carry off the water. In such cases, the paths were sometimes rapidly eroded but were filled in agan by laborers as soon as the sever rains were over. It Is doubtful if this is good practice and it would seem than some special drainage arrangement would be better. Seed Testing. I: all nurseries, the variable results obtained from forest tree seeds, were collected from different sources, during different seas is ages, and various methods of storing, showed the need of extensive nation tests. Such tests are necessary to secure good results in owing and should also furnish a criterion in the selection of regions, and individual trees from which seed should be collected. The is methods of seed testing which have been used are as follows: 1. Color test; good seeds are usually brighter colored than poor seed 2. Frying pan test; good seeds pop open in a hot frying pan while poor seeds char. J. Jack-knife test; good seeds fill the seed coats, weak *eed. partial- </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ly fill the seed coats and dead seeds are empty or nearly so. Poor seeds are frequently discolored on the interior. r Water test; weak seeds and dead seeds float while good seeds sink. 5. Blotter test; actual germination between blotters. 6. Moist chamber test; actual germination in moist chambers. 7. Sawdust test; actual germination in moist sawdust. 8. Soil test: a. In greenhouse — actual germination. b. In nursery beds — actual germination. ■t present, the Forest Service is testing forest tree seed on a large and good results are already being secured. Seed Sowing. This subject has been considered in many works on forestry and while general results apply very well, there can be little doubt that for many species, variation will be necessary to a striking degree. It is also apparent that considerable experimentation will be necessary for many of our species which have not been extensively grown and concerning which there is meagre information. Kmost of the Forest Service nurseries, the system of drill or row g prevails. However, there is still considerable discussion con- I the relative merits of broadcasting, sowing in drills lengthwise bed. and sowing in drills crosswise of the bed. Each system has merits and will be followed according to local requirements. It should be easy to determine what system of drill seeding is to be preferred, since the principle is practically the same. Crosswise rowt are more easily cultivated and more easily weeded than lengthwise rows but the latter are sown much more quickly and require slightly mure time in weeding and cultivation. At Halsey, Nebraska, root pruning is much more easily accomplished in long rows than in crosswise rows. On the whole, results seem to favor the long row as the cheaper method of producing seedlings, since it saves time in spring and early summer when time is most valuable. Bull pine (pinus ponderosa) may be sown in lengthwise rows at five to ten cents per pound while crosswise rows would cost three or more times as much. For seed drills, the planet, Jr and the Iron Age are especially valuable. The first mentioned is usually preferred for conifers since it sows more evenly and ordinarily gives better results with unclean seed. The Iron Age is sometimes proferred for deciduous tree seed. This difference in use is largely due to a metal device for controlling seed flow in the Planet, Jr and a brush device in the Iron Age. It is held, however, that the unsatisfactory results with the Iron Age machine are often due to a lack of care rather than to the defects of the machine. Both of these machines give the best results with coniferous seed of moderate size, such as those of Bull pine (plnns ponderoga), Scotch pine (pinns sjltestris). </seg>

Many men never become sufficiently expert at this work to secure the best results.

Special treatment of coniferous seed with red lead is usually neces - sary to prevent their being eaten by birds. The easiest method of treat - ment is to moisten a bucketful of seed and then stir in red lead. The dim of moisture will cause the red lead to stick to the seed and only a few minutes stirring is required to get an even coating. This process usually does not cost more than two cents per pound as one pound of the red lead will treat from 5 to 8 bushels of seed and the red lead has been known to remain on the planted seed for a year. Moistening coniferous seed or stratifying it in moist sand for a few days decreases the time necessary for germination after planting and it may increase the per rent that will germinate.

At Halsey, Nebraska, it was customary for years to water the seedlings by spray from hose. This was a tedious process and in a climate where evaporation is rapid it often happened that watering throughout the late afternoon and up to late at night was not adequate during the driest and hottest periods. Dur - ing the last three years the system has been changed to surface irrigation with good results in lessening the cost of labor and in securing adequate watering. The system of surface irrigation for forest nurseries was first suggested by the writPr fcr ranger nurseries in New Mexico where the soil was heavy and the ranger's time was occupied by many other duties It was later experimented with in the large nurseries under the direction </seg>
            <seg id="p155">FOREST NURSERY PRACTICE 155 At the Fort Bayard nursery where low shade frames were uaed it was customary to water by throwing a spray over the frames and to allow the water to drip from the frames onto the seedbed. This system is opened to serious objection because of the amount of water lost in evaporation, unless t is performed at night, and because the method is slow. In California 100 foot hose was used with two sprinklers which threw a revolving spray. Ths saves labor an dthe water was dis - tributed even enough on the porous soil to be entirely satisfactory. K different soils require modifications in the system of watering. For ice the adobe soil at the Fort Bayard nursey absorbs water slowly washes readily when it becomes saturated.

Evaporation is less at night and occurred had it would seem that in nurseries where artificial watering by hose is necessary that it would be best to water late in the afternoon and early in the evening. In moderately humid climates it may be possible to use light watering with success Iatering in the north during the growing season should be stopped y by the middle of August of the first of September.

By placing the board on the bed the sur - face of the soil is readily broken without disturbing the shallow planted seed. In Colorado this board also served the purpose of cultivation after the seedlings broke through the ground and is considered a rapid, satis - factory method for heavy loam soil. Eter the seedlings are up it is customary to use a specially con - hI rake which is made by using nails for teeth and has a breadth lite equal to the distance between drills. In some cases garden have been used by raknig rght over hte seedlings. Such practice r causes more loss than is occasioned by using the home-made rakes much more rapid and where labor is scarce may be used to some age. I] broadcasted beds the stand of seedlings is usually dense enough to the growth of weeds and to protect the soil well enough so that limited cultivation is necessary. Often broadcasted beds are not any cultivation. Cultivation should always follow each rain or artificial watering un - less it is a region where there is a pronounced rainy season, when culti - vation should be given as soon as the ground is sufficiently dry. Shallow, frequent cultivation is to be greatly preferred over deep, infrequent culti - vation. Cutivation on the heavy soils such as is found at Fort Bayard must be much more frequent than is required on the sandy soil at Halsey or the gravel soil at the Wasatch. Naturally, more cultivation is needed in New Mexico and Southern California than in the north becase of the low humidity of the air and the rapid evaporation of moisture from the At most of the government nurseries, it is customary to cultivate every 7 to 10 days, although at Halsey 3 to 5 cultivations during the season have been considered sufficient. At Halsey it has been the practice to cease cultivation from the first to the middle of August to allow the seedlings to "harden up" before winter. Weeds continue to grow after this but assist in hardening the seedlings and do not make sufficeint growth to form seeds. Mulching Mult! isually used to protect seed during the germination period, to protect seedlings from frost effect, to retain moisture in th« soil and occasionally to retard growth in spring. The best mulches are tree leaves, sphagnum or other mosses, straw or hay. The ideal mulch is one free from seeds which are likely to be introduced into the nursery. It should also fit closely enough ot protect the seedlings and yet allow ©ration. Most commercial nurseryman prefer leaves because of their advantage in the above respects and because they are cheap and hare a remarkably high fertilizer value.

Root pruning is followed in many commercial nurseries by using a machine drawn by horses which slight - ly resembles a slush scraper but works underground. The form of the trees of the same age grown as seedlings in the open, seedlings under half shade, root pruned stock and transplant stock has been found to vary greatly and it is to be hoped that some system of root pruning can be devised that will be cheaper and fully as effective as transplanting. Root pruning gives the best comparative results with deep rooted species Transplanting.

Trencher method of slit trenching with board planting Tbe dibble method is performed by using a dibble eight to ten . long bo as to give plenty of room for the root of the seedlings. Th. should be moist enough so that the dibble hole will retain its shape, and the seedling should be planted by pushing the roots of the seedling into the hole with the end of the dibble. The operation is completed by - placing the dibble about two inches away from the planting hole and pressing the soil toward the first hole. This fills the first hole and makes a hole for the second seedling in the same operation. In light sandy Ic aru. a man may plant at the rate of 600 to MM trees in ten hours, of hard work.

Phillips, Professor of Forestry, University of Nebraska It is not yet a generation since the demand for land began to in - tensify over the United States as a whole. From single ranches which stretched as far as the ey« could see, thousands of homesteads have been made. From the so-called deserts of the middle-west have arisen powerful agricultural commonwealths, richer than many European na - tions; from the days of the prospecting pioneer we have progressed to the days of the developer. Land once went a-begging; now, it is being searched for at prices far beyond the fondest dreams of our fathers and the demand steadily increasing. Is is generally recognized that most of our agricultural land is already in private holdings of moderate sice and the question now before the people is the one of best use. What to do with our slope and flood lands is a problem of great importance. Our soil experts have found that it is a serious problem to maintain soil fertility and soil moisture on many of the best level lands. On slope lands the problem is a much more difficult one. Farmers frequently find that the crops of their slopes are not paying for the cultivated crops such lands will produce. Orchardists may secure fair to good crops but are often confronted with soil washing. The graz - ing expert and the forester find that forage grasses or forest trees are usually the most satisfactory crops that ran be grown on slope slopes steeper than 13 to 25 degrees, according to slope and locality.

Italy, Spain and Portugal have all suffered from terrible floods which have largely resulted from the removal of forests on slope lands. It has frequently been said that one whole province in Spain, once prosperous, is now almost an entire desert as a result of removing slope forests. In southern France, favorable slopes are largely terraced and used for grape culture. In China, many of the steeper slopes are terraced for crop production, but the destruction of the forest has pro - ceeded to such an extent that even such an exceptional treatment is not productive of good resuts.

Im - mense areas, such as occur in the White Mountains have been demanded of their timber and great erosion of the soil has followed without the aid of a plow. Throughout the middle-west, erosion has occured on moderate slopes to a considerable extent, and no state in the Union can afford to disregard the importance of protecting such areas. With us in Nebraska, the question of what to do with our slope lands is an important one. Some of our most important streams rise in the forested slopes of the Rocky Mountains and we shall always b* interested in the treatment these lands secure. From the plctureao* bluffs bordering the Missouri, to the hills and small mountains of Pin* Ridge, we have a large amount of scattered slope land inter spread through the rich prairies. On the gentle slopes in this state, the use of such crops as alfalfa and fruit have given excellent results, but on moderate slopes it is largely a question of forage grasses or forest trees, while on the steepest slopes, the forest becomes almost a necessity. Advantage of Planting. The advantage of planting forest trees on slopes are many. We hav» a large area of gullies, rough ravines, bare slopes and eroded areas, which are not only a loss to the farm, but are unsightly. Not only could these areas be made productive by planting forest trees, but such growth would add materially to the beauty of the farm and the beauty of the -tat*- Hillsides will often support as trifty forest growth as the mor« favorable agricultural sites, and in addition such tree planting is usually more attractive than it could be on level areas. In the hilly land about Ord, Nebraska, are to be found many fine forest plantations of con - siderable acreage, in which green ash, honey locust, cottonwood, and white willow have given the best results. The hardy catalpa is being tried on gentle slopes in various parts of the state at the present time, and in many regions there is no doubt that this tree will be found to form a very desirable plantation. Several plantation owners in the vici - nity of Ord have stated that they consider a 10 to 20 acre forest planta - tion worth from $500 to $1000 in the improvement that it gives to the farm. Many of these forests are on the poorest land on the farm, yet have given profitable yields in fence-posts and repair material. It is te this locality and the eastern half of the state where the most interest is being taken at the present time in the planting of broad-leaved trees o« slope lands.

Natural Facton to Help, Not only should active measures be taken toward tree planting along river courses, but great care should also be taken in managing the \s which still remain along many of our streams. The most lux - uriant tree growth occuring within the state has always been that boid - stream courses. Natural factors on this class of land are more favorable to tree growth than on any other quality of site in the state. and it will always be comparatively easy to maintain forests wher*- Xature works with man rather than against him. The list of trees which stow along our stream courses comprises all the most important I that grown within our borders, and with most of them natural 1 1 duction is prolific. Several natural stands which were cut over in tin - early history of the state have reproduced naturally and are being cut far the second or third time. Great results have been secured by pro - tecting this natural timber from fire, over-cutting and over-grazing. Live stock may always be allowed in natural stands of timber along •tream courses, but should rarely be allowed to run in the wood lot the rear around, as is sometimes the case. Forestry work on slope and flood lands is steadily growing in im - portance and is bound to be one of the important lines of forestry work in the state. Such lands as are unsuited to agriculture but which will support good tree growth should be kept in forest or planted to forest trees as soon as means will permit. Reports coming to the Forester of the Experiment Station show that this work is rapidly gaining in im - portance and that a good begining is being made. Comprehensive meas - ure* for a complete study of the whole problem should be undertaken in tke near future under competent foresters and engineers, and adequate plans should be made for every section of the state concerned. </seg>

Ii excellent method of growing tea roses is to make a border 4 to 6 i width by 6 to 8 feet in length, according to the grounds.

Fiill Planting. It sometimes happens the planter has more leisure for planting in late autumn than in early spring, during which season, he is rushed with the seeding of farm crops. In case the ground has a suitable amount of moisture or water can be conveniently secured to make it sufficiently raoist, then certain varieties of small fruits may be planted in late autumn. We have found that grape vines planted in early November, after the wood was well ripened and matured, made a stronger growth the succeeding season than wheij planted in the spring time. We, how - ever, always take the precaution to heavily mulch, cover, bury each vine .-o planted. Raspberries and blackberries may be planted at the same season and the currant also, if heavily mulched and thoroughly protected. It is rarely wise in Nebraska to plant fruit trees, shade trees or for- P trees in the fall, since under ordinary orchard or field conditions. ; is too great risk that the trees may suffer from drying out before opening days of spring. I is legitimate however, to dig the trees in the fall of the year and them root, body and branch, carrying them over the winter in ess for early spring planting. Tens of thousands of trees are lost year by planters who receive trees and simply heel them instead ying the tree root, body and branch.

The next week, doubtless some of you were able to visit the ited at Council Bluffs, where samples of fruit grown under irrigation be noted and compared with fruits grown by cultivation. During ast 2 years, I have been enabled to visit other exhibits of irrigated , notably that of the state of Washington at North Yakima.

Normally under irrigation, water has an original cost uf from to $60.00 per acre and then an annual maintenance cost of from 75c. to $5.00 per acre, the higher cost under pumping plants. These rates seem expensive, perhaps we might say excessive, and yet I have oft times thought here in Nebraska that if in the months of August and September, I could have had an abundance of water to use in our laden orchards, that the fruit would swell up enough and be enough larger to ju almost any expense. $20.00 an acre annually would be a very small charge in comparison with the benefits secured. Iillious of trees will be planted during the next 5 years under Jon on the Pacific slope. While they have the advantage of the ble climate, fertile soils and usually water for irrigation, in many the orchards are watered through the medium of very expensive ng plants. The far famed district at Palisade, Colo, is supplied by ping plant. A part of that water used in irrigation is raised 81 feet. All these regions are hampered by being a very long distance from leir best markets; the fruit has to be transported across mountain ranges, involving very expensive transportation. In discussng commercial orchards in Nebraska, our minds immediate - ly revert to the orchards in Richardson, Otoe, Cass. Washington, Doug - las, Saline, Fillmore and other eastern counties. Orchards were first planted in this portion of the state. Here are to be found the older and larger orchards.

            <seg id="p189">F. J. Pratt, Humphre&gt; From what we can gather good winter apples grown in any one year have not been enough to go around. It is estimated by our best of authorities that there are not enough good winter apples growr at every man, woman and child on earth can eat one a month, or ft a year. The rules of health say that every person should eat at te apple every day. This means that the present population of the United States should consume 10 bushels of apples annually. But the average American apple crop is only estimated at 90,000,000 ushels (30,000,000 barrels). From this number the United States ex lKirted to Suropean countries over 6,000,000 bushels last year being that the wealthy people of Europe paid more for this fruit than th American markets offered. The exportation of the American apple i increasing from year to year and the prices for good winter apples are getting higher every year, as the demand far exceeds the supply The indications at the present time are that with our increase in popu- lation, that if fruit raising does not increase at a more rapid rate in the future than it has in the past, that it will only be the moneyed class of people and he producer himself that will have fruit, and the middle or wage earners, will go without. We often hear it said by the inexperienced fruit grower or by the pessimist that Nebraska cannot grow good winter apples. This, however, is a mistake.

The commercial orcharding idea that prevailed in Nebraska and some other Missouri valley states twenty-five to thirty years ago has been almost entirely obliterated, through a misconception or lack of understanding in what constitutes successful orcharding frcm a com - mercial, business and practical standpoint. Agriculture, which might be said to embody all features of soil tillage and land uses, has been wrongly interpreted by many of our pioneer settlers. The successful work of a practical or scientific hoiticulturali?t in his efforts of growing and developing orchards, trees, plants and shrubs does not imply that the ignorant, unskilled, untutored in this line of industry can hope to meet with equal success, by merely planting the trees, giving them a little start in cultivation to direct them forward to maturity, then with - drawing all fart-«T attention and care and standing back to see the commercial reward in bowed-down trees — limbs breaking with their weight of fruits Kris picture, in brief, is the history of commercial orcharding in Ne - i.

As the commercial orchards came into bearing there was introduced a feature of business qualification that had not been studied, or, in fact, given any attention. The world had been expected to come forward, even to the orchard, in its anxiety and desire to get the fruit. It did not come, though in some instances fruit dealers did come and they bought </seg>

This period of disappointment was soon met by another. The insects whose efforts seemed to be centered in relieving the orchardist of any fuither trouble reduced the quality of fruit below the mercantile K.rd and the orchard ceased to ces. be more than a pasture in many Kiis history carries with it the reage above that of the family well improved farm in the sta ?adily observed condition among ise that were prompted in their majority of orchards comprising orchard which is now a part of :e.

The orchardist igly has surrendered all interest in this feature of farm improve - except as a matter of reference when speaking of the farm i offered for sale, "A large bearing orchard of so many acres, etc." e should add, "of worm-producing fruits." Ntirlcct Is the Rule, This neglect of the orchard, which is so universally found on the farm of the farmer, unless he perchance be of a horticultural tendency, taste and inclination to have every department of the farm improvement come up to a fixed standard, which he has cultivated and established in his methods of management, is the rule, not the exception. When the orchard is grown, when the trees are too big for the stock to injure by horning or rubbing down, it is practically turned loose to take care of itself. This would not be so fatal in results if the pruning and insect features of care were looked after. Here are introduced some matters of detail that "the get rich easy" orchardist had not figured Into the account when he planned the enterprise. The orchard was to take care of itself after it was five or six years old, just like the old eastern orchard that produced great crops of fruit at random, except that this new western orchard on the rich prairie lands, would go on for a generation or so with its never-ceasing crop. The insect pests had not yet made their appearance, because there were no orchards, nothing for them to do. Times Hair Changed.

This, however. not necessarily give this orcharding enterprise any advantage over any other orchard in the state, similarly handled and managed for fruit production. The questions at issue and which we desire to bring out in this article are: Can commercial orcharding be made a success in Ne - braska? Why are people skeptical as to their ability to grow fruit profit - ably in Nebraska? It should be understood in the outstart with all persons who engage in any work or enterprise that there are obstacles and hindrances con - stantly coming up to check and interfere with one's plans and progress, and until we properly understand how to turn aside these interruptions we will be handicapped in our progress, but not necessarily defeated. Just so with the commercial orchardist in Nebraska; he has met the enemy and been able to conquer him. In the first place, the insect pest had to be headed off, exterminated, when established in the orchard. This Mr. Stephens, in the management of his orchard, has been able to do, and so perfectly has this work been carried out that in all this great orchard of more than eighty acres, after traveling miles through its broad avenues, up one row of apple trees and down another, closely reasonable, and he finds commission men at the other end of the road »no t and willing to handle his shipments and to hurry his prodm and into the hands cf the consumer and all this assistance at a reasonable cost, when all things are considered.

They are used in numbers ranging from forty to eighty to re of trees and have proven satisfactory in raising the temperature sntly to ward off frost.

Yield of Single Trees. In 1907 single trees of the Rawles Janet apple gave thirty bushels per tree. From 264 trees of this variety that season enough fruit was sold to pay the running expenses of handling the entire property. Single trees of the Ben Davis have yielded eight barrels.

Some hundreds of trees have been planted in the plum orchards and many vaiieties have been tested. Among the more promising we note 1 vrwood. This variety was originated by the late Theodore Williams nson, Neb. This plum is a seedling of the Burbank and Brittlewood, the American Brittlewood giving increased hardihood, and the other parent giving size and quality. This variety is doing remarkably well this season over the entire state, clear up to the Wyoming line. At the time of our visit Early Harvest, Red June, Sweet June, Yellow nt, Duchess, Cooper's Early White, Kirkbridge White and Sax - ton had already been marketed. Varieties next to run are the Day, Maiden Blush, Wealthy and Gravenstein. These will be followed by leading winter varieties — Grimes' Golden, Missouri Fippin, Winesap, Ben Davis and Rawle's Janet. All these varieties and many more are bearing abundantly and many trees are over-laden. This orchard was established in 1871 by K. F.

The grape is a hot weather plant and extreme of the present month is favorable to the vineyards. of elevated locations for orchards with contiguous lower levels into which the cold air of frosty nights could settle. Under the inspiration of this suggestion, 240 acres were purchased near Crete, located c n the edge Df the Blue river valley, mostly reaching up onto the divide between tbe ■ river and Salt creek. By special arrangement with the land depart- of the Burlington railroad it was agreed that 100 acres should be planted in orchard and timber, a concession in terms of payment being made by the Burlington favoring an enterprise of that character. Ground was broken the first season and twenty acres of orchard was planted the next spring. The 1,100 trees of this orchard were purchased of the late Samuel Barnard of Table Rock, then a prominent nurseryman of the state. Of these 1,100 apple trees planted on ground broken the preceding sum- mer only five trees failed to grow. From year to year additions were made to the orchard until eighty acres were planted, and about 120 acres, or half the tract, is now in orchard and timber. Mr. Stephens has found his best markets in western and northwestern N'ebraska and northwestern Kansas and eastern Wyoming.

            <seg id="p200">THE "CAROLINA" OR "NORWAY POPLAR." Several years ago I prepared a paper on the Carolina Poplar for the United States Forest Service, which was later somewhat revised and published about three years ago in the Annual Report of the Nebraska state board of Agriculture. On account of the widespread interest in this tree I may very properly reprint here the substance of that paper, making such revisions as will bring it down to the present state of our knowledge. In the West, especially in the Mississippi valley, a tree has been largely advertised and sold under the name of Carolina Poplar. In some cases extravagant claims are made in regard to its good qualities, which, on the other hand, are strenuously denied by some tree growers. There has been a gotd deal of doubt, also, in regard to the specific identity of the tree, some holding it to be quite distinct from the common cottonwood.while others regard it as a mere variation or sport of that species, which has been propagated by cuttings from the staminate tree. In order to help to solve these questions, the following facts are pre - sented: Description of the Tree. Leares.— These are large, broadly heartshaped, prominently ser- Bwith incurved teeth, the vein The texture is firm, and both foliage is a rich, dark, green ed, are more or less reddish ade. On vigorous shoots the rather prominent on the under sur - iurfaces are quite smooth. The color and the petioles, which are long and as is frequently, also, the midrib of leaves are often five to seven inche: Kfour inches broad, and their petioles fully three inches long, while ;s vigorous shoots, the leaves may be as small as three inches in i, three in breadth, and their slender petioles may be no more than iches long. Krtigs. — -More or less angled by narrow, corky ridges which extend fard from the center and sides of the leaves. Color when mature, brown. The angles are much more prominent on very vigorous and may be almost wanting on those which are slow-growing. Young Brunches. — These eventually become smooth and round by the expansion and streching of the bark as the branch increases in thickness. Color, light brown. This brownish color should serve to distinguish the Carolina Poplar from the common western cottonwood, on which the young branches ultimately become white. Shape of Crown. — The crown or "top" of this tree is rather narrow By Charles E. Bessey. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">THE CAROLINA POPLAR 201 on account of the more erect growth of the branches. Left to them - selves, the branches of the crown tend to grow upward somewhat as la the Lombardy Poplar, but by no means to such an extreme. Even when the top has been pruned back by having the terminal branches macs shortened, it soon resumes its narrowed and somewhat compressed shape. This erect tendency of the branches and compact form of the crown la this tree, is in marked contrast to the common western sottonwood la which the branches are much more divergent, resulting in a markedly spreading crown. Buds. — Much less gummy than in the common western cottonwood, but otherwise resembling them. Bunk. — Darker colored (brownish) than in the common western wood, in which the trunk is grayish. Powers. — Only the staminate ("male") flowers occur on the trees observation. These are in elongated cylindrical clusters (catkins), are compact at first, but eventually they elongate and become r and drooping. When they first appear, they are purplish-red in but as they grow older, they fade into a dirty gray. Kapidit) of Growth. — Under cultivation, Caroline Poplar trees make a strong and vigorous growth, the shoots of a season often attaining a length of six to ten feet. Such shoots are nearly half an inch in thickness a little distance from the terminal bud, and are always very distinctly angled. This rapid growth of the young trees appears to be normal for the Carolina Poplar, since it occurs in all healthy trees. The same rapid growth, with consequent increase of size, and marked development of angles on the twigs, takes place in the common western cottonwood when sprouts spring up from the stump after the cutting of the tree, and it may well be that this similarity of the abnormal shoot of the one tree to the normal shoot of the other has contributed to the confusion as to their specific identity. The Name "Carolina Poplar." I. is the opinion of some persons who have become interested is uestion of the value of this tree that the name "Carolina Poplar" recent introduction, one correspondent going so far as to say that e probably did not exceed twenty years, and that "the name has bees in order to defraud the people, by causing them to think they were g something different from the cottonwood." The earliest use of the name "Carolina Poplar" was by an English botanist, Aiton, in the first edition of the "Hortus Kewensis," published in 1789 under his original description of Populns angnlata. In the second edition of this work, published in 1813, the description of Popalns BDEnlntu is considerably improved, while the name Carolina Poplar is re - tained. </seg>

In both works and all editions, one of the poplars (Popnlos un - traluta), is described under the English name "Carolina Poplar", and It agrees in every respect with the tree we are now considering. Bcaisne and Naudin, also Frenchmen, in their "Manuel de l'Amateur rdins" (1866) describes Popolns angulata, naming it the Carolina ("peuplier de la Caroline"). KHemsley's "Handbook of Hardy Trees, Shrubs and Herbaceous ' (published in England in 1877) the name Carolina Poplar i* to Populus nngrulatu. In the "Dendrologie," of Koch, an eminent German dendrologist. published in 1872, Populns angulala is called the "Carolinische Pappal" (Carolina Poplar), and this name is applied also to the variety serotina, which Is known in the staminate form only. In Koehne's "Deutsche Dendrologie" (1893) the work of another competent dendrologist, Populus angulata is called the "Karolinische Pappel" (Carolina Poplar), including also the variety gerotlna. Bailey in his "Cyclopedia of Amercian Horticulture," Vol. Ill, 1901, discusses the matter as follows: Populus deltoides var. carollnensls, Carolina Poplar. A very distinct tree in habit of growth, making a straight, upright or pyramidad head; leaves usually less distinctly deltoid, and more gradually taper pointed than Populus deltoides. Native. The Carolina Poplar is much planted, and nurseymen consider it to be distinct from the Cottonwood. It differs in strict, straight appearance, and it is a most vigorous grower. It is much planted in Europe, where it is known as the Swiss Poplar. Its botanical position needs to be investi - gated." In Bailey's discussion, it must be remembered that when he speaks of the "Ccttonwood" he is thinking of the eastern species, which differs from the Cottonwood of the Missouri Valley in sufficient degree to warrant their separation as distinct species. The Carolina Poplar does not resemble our western Cottonwood, but it does resemble the eastern What Name Shall We Use. From the foregoing it would seem very clear that the Carolina Poplar is to be called Populus angolata, and this was the practice of American botanists until about thirty years ago when Dr. Watson first suggested that the name might have to be dropped. Thus Michaux, Willdenow, Pursh, Eaton, Elliott, Gray, Wood, Wesmeal and Vasey all used the name Popnlns iiniriilnt;i. Latterly this species has generally been merged with the Eastern Cottonwood, but as shown above this is no doubt an error. </seg>
            <seg id="p203">THE CAROLINA POPLAR 203 Now if we call the Carolina Poplar Populas aniruluta, what shall we call tbe (ottonwood? This question may be answered briefly, as follows: 11 e Eastern Cottonwood that we used to call Populus ninnillfer.i, is ' the tree that Marshall first describes and named Populus drltoideu earliest book on American trees — his "Arbustum Americanum," pub. in 1785, so this must be the name of the Eastern Cottonwood. Our ■n Cottonwood has borne several names, but it seems now that the hich it will have to bear is Popiilus «;irir&lt;-ntiL, a name given in of our greatest American student of trees. We may bring the together in this way: Eastern Cottonwood — Populus deltoiuVsi. Carolina Poplar — l'opulu&gt; anurulatii. Western Cottonwood — Poinilu* ssi rtrciitii. The »w Name "&gt;orniij Poplar, Several years ago we began to hear about the "Norway Poplar," and I have repeatedly been asked as to its name and relationship. So a year or two ago I took up the matter and after a careful examinaicn of speci- mens I found that they agreed perfectly with specimens of Carolina Poplar. I know that some of the nurserymen say that the root system is different and all that, but I suspect that this is merely one of the devices they have resorted to in order to sell their trees better. When I made the announce- ment to some of the people who have "Norway Poplars" for gale, they said that above ground the tree was apparently the same as the "Carolina Poplar" but that below ground, where I had not seen it, it was "very different". I do not believe this at all. 1 am confident it is nothing but a trick of the trade and that we have here the same old Carolina Poplar, sold under another name. This of course, as everybody knows is one of the oldest tricks for the sal' When a thing has practi ■ run its course under an old name the thing to do, the thing that is is to get up a new name and to push the old thing under this new name. And that is what has been done in this case I am sure from all I have seen of it that the "Norway Poplar" is nothing else than the "Carolina Poplar." It has been given a new name for commercial purposes, the old name having worn out. Just notice that after a while when "Norway Poplar" wears out as "a name to con - jure with," the people who have such things for sale will get up another name, such as "Scotch poplar" perhaps, or possibly "Russian Poplar." anything new and quite northern. If you want to make a hit you might call it the "North Pole Poplar," "Greenland Poplar," or Alaska Poplar." It is very funny when you think of it how names are changed for com - mercial purposes, and how people will buy the old thing under the new To sum up then: — The Norway Poplar is only another name for the Carolina Poplar, and must bear the old name of Popolns angnlata.

And again, I cannot be certain of course that in all cases the trees offered for sale under the name "Norway Poplar" are the same.

It is true that frequently cattle will prefer other green things in the spring, but there is no question as to the nutritious qualities of the plants for pasturage. Then later in the season if the plants are mowed down before they have become woody, they yield a hay which is very much like that produced by alfalfa, to which the sweet clovers are related. In 'he third place the sweet clovers have been noted fpr a long time as yielding good honey in considerable quantity. Many bee-keepers esteem the sweet clovers so highly that they purposely sow the seed in places where they can be allowed to grow. I have heard bee keepers tell of their surreptitiously sowing the road sides at night with sweet clover seed for the benefit of their be«8.

            <seg id="p206">206 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Tho plaiil referred to is one of the sweet clovers. This could have been told by smelling the plant, especially when partially dried. The »ery sweet odor is what has given the plants the name of sweet clover. The sweet clovers belong to the genus Melilntos, and are all plants of considerable importance. They grow very easily and so have been called weeds by a good many people, but it has been shown that many of them are valuable forage plants, and it has also been known for a long time, that they are very valuable for yielding honey to the bee grower. There are two common species of sweet clover growing in this country, namely, the yellow sweet clover (Xelilotns nmcin;ilisi, and white •weet clover (Melllotus nlhal. They are both originally from Europe, but they are hardy plants and have spread westward across the country. In some states the law makers some years ago passed laws requiring that these plants should be cut out wherever found and so they are outlawed, but I have never felt that this was right. The sweet clovers may be made very useful on the farm if properly grown. In the first place they are among the best of thp clover-like plants for enriching the soil. Their little root tubercles are well known nitrogen collectors and there is no 11 why nitrogen might not be added to the soil by the growth of these plants. In the second place when the plants have grown a foot or fo in height they can be plowed under and the soil greatly enriched in this way. And in the third place when the plants are pretty well grown, but not yet hard and woody, they make a gocd hay, and lastly their flowers yield an abundance of most excellent honey. Yellow Sweet Closer. The yellow sweet clover is known botanically as Xelilotns officin:ilis. a native of the old world and has been brought to this country • ople who like it for various purposes. It is a very sweet-scented, honey-bearing plant and the bee keepers like it very much on this ac - count, as it furnishes a large amount of very good honey. In many parts of the country the bee keepers sow it along roadsides and else - where in order that their bees may have the honey to collect for the hives. For some reason some farmers have a great prejudice against this sweet clover. Probably the principal reason is that it grows up in a voluntary way and frequently forms great patches. Cattle do not care t it when it is green, although they will do so to some extent when cut and made into hay. For hay it should be cut before it gets to be too large and rank, as then the stems are too big to utilize. I never have shared in the general denunciations of the sweet clover that has beon indulged in by some people, and yet I can see that it may become a nuisance in some places. I should advise people in regions where there is much sweet clover to grow bees in great numbers. BulTiilo (liner.

            <seg id="p207">SWEET CLOVER, ETC. 207 is what has been known in the West as Buffalo Clover. I have no idea whatever as to why it was called Buffalo Clover. Its scientific name is Trifollum reflexum, and it is often found wild in Nebraska. It looks when growing, much like common red clover, and has leaves and heads of about the same size. The plants are a little more hairy than most of the red clover and the heads have this peculiarity that when they have blossomed the individual flowers bend down and turn brown in color. This brown color is a beautiful chestnut and adds much to the appearance of the clover. In fact it is these brown heads that one see3, and in this way the plants are seen and attention is called to them. The plants are mostly annual, sometimes, however, living for a greater length of time and becoming perennial for short periods. While there is nothing harmful in this clover, it has never yet been regarded as of sufficient importance to be brought under ordinary cultivation. It is sometimes grown as a curiosity and is interesting from this standpoint, but for pasture or forage it has not been looked upon as of sufficient importance to warrant anyone in attempting to cultivate it. Three Other Clovers. The one with rather large, long heads, which are silky hairy is what is known as the Rabbit-foot Clover. Its scientific name ii Trifolium arvense. It is a rather common species in Nebraska, and has on the one hand no bad qualities, while on the other it has no especially good qualities to commend it. It is sometimes grown, but is really not of enough importance to be brought under common cultivation. It is a native of Europe and has come in along with the seeds of other The second species is also a wild clover. It has cup-like growth at the back of the little heads and this distinguishes this species from the ordinary clovers. I know of no common name for that one and it is known in science as Trifolium ryatlilfrrnm. Like the one above it has no bad qualities, but on the other hand has very little to commend it. It is a wild thing which occasionally comes into cultivated grounds. 11 e third species is the Low Hop Clover. It has very small yellow 3 and after these have bloomed the flowers turn brown and remain heads, spreading out rather widely. The scientific name of this Trifolium procumbens and is very common in Nebraska. This ?en very commonly regarded as a harmless weed and probably jch. It is a native of Europe, and has come to this country in the of other and more important plants. Every one may rest assured that he does not have anything to fear in these three clovers. They will be eaten somewhat by cattle and other animals, and they constitute a good forage as far as they go.

            <seg id="p208">By Charles E. Bessey ■i much has been said recently about Dodder in the agricultural that it will be helpful if some of the replies to the inquiries that ome to me are given here essentially as they first appeared in the m (iinette. Dodder is a small climbing flowering plant, botanically very nearly related to the morning glories. The theory upon which we explain the dodder is that some morning-glory-like plant ages ago took to the habit of stealing food from the plants &lt; n which it climbed. Everybody knows that wild morning-glories climb over all sorts of other plants, twining round them very tightly. Now it is not a very difficult thing to under - stand that a plant under such circumstances might rather easily send a little root into the plant around which it is twining, and then the trouble would begin. Once the plant learned how to steal food in this way I imagine that it would be about as it is with a human being who gets the habit of stealing chickens, corn and other things from his neighbors. At any rate the dodder is structurally like a morning-glory. Its little flowers are really morning-glory flowers, very small it is true, and the little pods are quite like the pods of the morning-glories. The only differ - ence between the dodder and the morning-glories is that the dodder has no leaves, and yet if you will look very closely you will find that there are vestiges of leaves, and the theory here again is that since the dodder has become a parasite it does not need any leaves, and through disuse they have disappeared. When the dodder seeds fall to the ground they germinate very much as ordinary seeds do, and the tiny root which appears pushes into the ground and fastens itself there quite after the fashion of ordinary roots. At the same time the upper part of the plant is twining around such vegetation as it may be able to reach, and if in its reaching after other plants it finds a plant which it likes well enough it sinks its little roots into it and begins to absorb through them rather than through the root which is in the ground. This little root in the ground now being neglected and of no importance to the plant, dries up and from that time on the dodder lives wholly as a para- |[y correspondent is quite right when he suggests that if the dodder 10 root in the ground it can be eradicated much more readily, is quite true. Moreover nearly all the dodder plants die when r comes, unless in the extreme south, where some of the plants live over; in fact it is found that occasionally in the north a r plant which has attacked itself very near to the ground may </seg>
            <seg id="p209">209 live over until the next year. Ordinarily, however, this does not take place, and so if every dodder plant in the field is killed and it produce* no seeds the field will be rid of the pest. Dodder in Clover. Kie specimen which one correspondent sends is that of the Clover r, and it shows that he has a difficult problem on his bands. For years in the United States the clover was entirely free from the r, although it was badly affected in many parts of Europe. Some - like fifteen or twenty years ago the dodder began to appear in the States in considerable numbers and its increase has been quite until now there is probably not a state in the Union where the is not more or less troubled with it. The dodder is a flowering plant closely related to the morning - glory and like the morning-glory it twines around whatever it reaches. The morning-glory, however, when it starts from the seed sends its root into the ground and begins to gather nourishment from the soil, while the dodder allows its root to die very soon after it gets a start. In fact the root of the dodder is used only long enough to give it a little start, and when the vine has begun to twist itself around the clover it loses its own root, and from that time on it allows itself to live en - irely on the clover from which it sucks out the food matter it needs. If my correspondent will examine a fresh specimen, he will find that where the dodded twists around the clover stem, it sends in little suckers by means of which it steals nourishment from the clover. He need not be afraid that there is any poison in this dodder plant. It does not hurt the hay, although I suspect it does not add to its value in any way. However I imagine that it is very necessary he get rid of it because it will spread, otherwise, throughout his whole farm, and make It impossible for him to grow clover with success. For this reason the stock should not eat hay filled with this dodder because the seeds, which are much smaller than clover seeds, will be scattered in this way all over the farm. Eie only thing that can be done to get rid of this pest is to mow out tches affected and when they are dry to burn them. In this way ;ds would be burned. This should be done as soon as the dodded s in the field. Dodder Is Increasing, It is interesting to notice that specimens of dodders in cloven and alfalfas are coining in more and more every year. Twenty-five years ago clover dodder was almost wholly unknown, and I was very much aston - ished once in Iowa about that long ago to have specimens sent to me from the southern part of the state. They were, however, not of the sped— </seg>
            <seg id="p210">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 210 European clover dodder, the one that has made so much trouble to the growers of clovers and alfalfa (Lucern) in that country. Whenever Clover Dodder is found in a filed, it must be cut out as soon as it appears. The owner should go into his field with a sickle or perhaps a scythe and cut out carefully every bit of the clover that is affected with the Dodder. This should then be put into a bag and carried out of the field where it should be burned. The latter precaution is desirable because tbe seeds otherwise would ripen and there would be the danger of propagation of the plant in this way. There should be every effort made by farmers to keep out this Clover Dodder and it can be done only by careful weeding out from every field. It is easy to see it and with a sharp hand-sickle a man could go over a large field in a short time. It may be well to state that Dodder is propagated by seeds which little smaller than clover seeds, so small that they are commonly 1 in clover seed that has been grown in a field affected with Dodder, s is no question but that this Clover Dodder was brought to this ry as an impurity in Clover seed and this is an additional reason greater care should be taken in requiring seedsmen to sell only , pure seed. In reply to still another inquirer I may say in the first place that the seedsman who sold the alfalfa seed filled with dodder should be very severely condemned, and he ought to make some proper recom - pense. I do not know what the seed laws are in the various states, but they should be such as to protect the buyer against such contamination as teems to have been the case in the instance referred to. Now as to what to do for the field which has been injured by the growth of the dodder. It must be remembered that dodder is a tender annual, and dies out, at least for the most part, at the end of the year and before the winter sets in. It is true that in some instances dodder has been found to live over down near the root of the alfalfa or clover plant but it is agreed that this is not commonly the case. So if the owner can keep the dodder from producing any seeds he will eventually rid his field of it. The proper thing to do will be for him to watch the field and as soon as any dodder appears to have it cut out entirely and burned. It should say that a trusty boy provided with a sickle and a bag would be able to go over a very considerable field very carefully in a short time. I should send the boy over the field every few days with instructions to cut out and put into the bag every bit of dodder which he finds. It should be remembered that the dodder has no roots of its own in the ground. When the seeds first germinate they send a tiny root into the ground for a long enough time to enable the little plants to live until they have fastened themselves to the alfalfa stem, then the root portion of the dodder dies away and after that it has no con - nection with the ground. So when the boy is hunting for dodder he need not be afraid that any roots will be left in the ground </seg>

Westgate, University of Nebraska After a man has built his house and other necessary buildings, it is advisable for him to turn his attention toward beautifying the grounds about these buildings, in order that the entire effect of his premises will be as beautiful as possible. Grass seed has to be sown and trees and ornamental shrubs planted. In order for these plantings to be well executed, it is very necessary that a plan of the grounds be made, which will show where each tree or group of shrubs should be placed. All good houses are built according to a plan which an architect ; should likewise, although with less idea or plan. Each tree or shrub K?signed.

If the planting of annuals dn le taste of a person one year, he can change the style, somewhat. Mowing year. We may consider that the lawn, trees and shrubs . relatively unchangeable frame work, whereas the annual flowering give the trimming that may be altered every year, if so desired. But, nevertheless, there are certain rules which have to be observed in order to be successful in arranging and growing annual flowers. In the first place, never place a flower bed of annuals, or any other kind of flowers, in the center of a good lawn, for the lawn itself is not only in - jured by it but the scenic effect of that portion of the grounds is lessened. A nice lawn, when properly tended, gives a much finer setting to a place than any number of flowers. The bulk of annual flowering plan£s should be placed in the background or along the shrubbery border. If used in beds, locate the beds near to one side of the lawn or in the rear. Most annual flowers, however, are not so effective when placed in formal beds because of their straggly habit. In choosing such flowers for bedding purpose, we should decide on those which are neither too straggly nor too formal. A gaudy carpet or design bed should never be used for decorating private grounds. Such things are in reality freaks and should </seg>

Some annual vines, such as the morn - ing-glory and moonflower, are very good for covering porches and especially unsightly objects, as dead tree trunks, dilapidated outbuildiings, (one wishes to grow annuals in a flower garden, he should plant, te and tend them like a vegetable garden and the blooms should ted from them every day, after they commence to flower. This of growing cut flowers is quite another thing, however, from the t having flowering plants, for the purpose of decorating the Ii making the groups of annual flowering plants for the border, al - place the tall growing kinds in the rear, in front of the taller shrubs es. Low growing plants should be next to the border edge and the m tall plants ought to be planted between the largest and smallest By this method we will obtain the best view and finest effect the flowers bloom. But as we are grouping the plants according to their heights, we must also arrange them so that the colors of their Sowers will harmonize. The mixing of dull colors can be exercised with considerable freedom, but bright colored flowers need to be arranged with greater care. Brilliant colors, which contrast too strongley, may an otherwise good effect. White makes a good contrast with a great number of colors and consequently one finds a great many white flowers used in annual plantings. I have found in experimenting with annual flowers, that they have a wide range of characteristics. Some are hardy and bloom profusely the whole season, almost regardless of moisture, whereas others are killed by the first dry spell. Some like a sandy and ether prefer a clay soil. There are a few kinds which I would especially recommend because they are so well adapted to our soils and climatic conditions and bloom during the entire summer. Among tall growing plants for the background, few are any better than hollyhocks and castor beans. The hollyhocks, with their large flowers are very showy. The blossoms of the castor beans are not very notice - able, but their tropical-like foliage is excellent. Balsams, marigolds, phloxes and zinnias give us wide range of colors for selecting medium tall growers. The zinnias have large composite flowers and an ex - tremely long season to bloom. If I were to recommend a single annual flower as the best under all conditions, I would choose the zinia. For edging the border, sweet alyssum, ageratum, mignonette and portulace are well adapted. The first two are used to the greatest extent. There are many other good annual flowers, but these are some especially recom - mended for planting, if the conditions are adverse. Iifter one has made the plans for planting and selected his seed, ext thing to be considered is the method of planting. It is a very plan to scatter a liberal quantity of well rotted manure over the during winter. This should be scattered evenly over the surface at it can be well mixed in the spring. After the frost has left the </seg>

Turn the soil over, when you spade it and break lp the lumps as you go, in order that they may not bake. Pulverb the surface thoroughly by using a common garden rake, and it is the; .eady for the seed sowing, providing the soil and air are warm e ugh. If the soil is too cold, the seeds may not germinate well and c n if they do. they may be killed by an early spring frost. In planting e seed, they should be scattered rather profusely over the soil surface for it is bet- ter to have too many than not enough as many of them ay not grow. Cover the seed by raking them into the soil. Such DC should be no thicker than outside conditions demand. Although a have many strong winds and heavy rains in the spring, it seems to me lat an eighth of an inch cover is sufficient for nearly all such seed.-;. It is u- unnecessary to water the seed bed artifically, but in case t e surface b« comes too dry before the seeds germinate it may be a go&lt; plan to give the soil a thorough soaking. After the plants are up well, hin them out n case they are too thick.

No state in tt? union has had greater difficulties to overcome than Minnesota, and no class of men have won more sublime victories along the hoiticultural line. Every defeat was a challenge which was heartily taken up until victory followed victory, and now this northern state has the best, the largest and most enthusiastic society in the United States, if net in the world. Just think of it, the membership is now over 1 and will soon reach :'.,umi. From beginning to the end the different pro - grams were carried out without a hitch. Secretary Latham had all the machinery well oiled. The first paper was on the Ponderosa, or bull pine, by the president of the Nebraska Park and Forest society, who is also a life member of the Minnesota society . He gave his experience of twenty-five years with this remarkable tree, showing its adaption to the great west and north - west. He showed how the farmer could raise these trees in the open as easily as he can onions, he gave the expenience of an ordinary farmer in Manitoba who raised 3,000 from one-half pound of seed at the initial cost r 1,000. He had samples with him showing the nee - of transplanting when a year old, thus securing a mass of fibrins roots. He also spoke of the by-products of this tree.

He hoped that in a few years members would come to setings wearing overcoats of their own growing. A. B. Coleman gave an interesting paper on raising small firuits on the pine lands of northern Minnesota. The discussion following showed that this portion of the state was producing enormous crops of splendid berries. Walter A. Yatmke gave an accounty of his remarkable su with the Homer Cherry in the southwestern portion of the state. Dis - cussion developed the fact that cherries had not been successfully grown north of St. Paul. In the afternoon the general subject of evergreens was conducted by former president, Clarence Wedge of Albert Lea. He brought in quite a number of specimen trees of his own growth. Mr. Wedge has had special success along this line. In the discussion, the fact was brought out that every failure of Rocky mountain evergreens in Minnesota has been traced to the fact that the seeds had been gathered </seg>

Of course he gave us a paper of superior merit. A man of his force, vivacity, and enthusiasm would cheer up the coldest region of the continent, and I doubt not flowers will spring up in his. The evening of December 2, the great annual banquet was held when everything broke loose and there was "sense and nonsense, toasts and sweets, the feast of the season and the flow of soul," but no "flowing bowl." This is the great annual unbend after a strenuous season of toil when a year of relaxation is packed in a few hours of fun. Wednesday morning the Plant Breeders' Association held a very spirited meeting. Great enthusiasm is developed in the production of iron-clad apples and hundreds of promising seedlings are coming to the front. The world's leading pomologist, Charles G. Patten of Charles City, Iowa, was there. A man who wears his seventy-six years with the suppleness of youth and says he must live to be one hundred in order to complete his work. The Nebraska Horticultural society is exclusively devoted to horti - culture. The Minnesota society has as its auxiliaries, The Rose society, Plant Breeders' auxiliary, Bee Keepers' Society, Women's auxiliary, con - ducted by the brightest women in the state. Then comes the foresty association, which, instead of being pushed to one side is welcomed and fostered and given a prominent place. The annual report which Is pre - pared with great care gives a complete report of all these auiliaries. *They are members of the great horticural society.

Bach sub-organization has its officers who carry out their own programs at a specified time, and the whole is fitted together so that there is no hitch, misunderstanding or delay. Minnesota has quite a number of experiment stations; a new one has just been taken on at Paynesville, Minn., under the care of Frank Brown. This station is making a great success with rais - ing evergreens, ornamental, peonies and perennials. It is one of the fartherest north in the United States, and its work is looked upon with much interest and it is an off-shoot of the select nursery of York, Nebraska. Top working apples had an important place in the discussion. After years of earful experimenting, it was found that even tender varities, like Grimes' Golden and Jonathan would do as well north of their own belt The hardiness of the stock seemed to impart hardiness to the scion. One man grafted a lot of Melinda's on Dutchess' with remarkable results. He secured enormous crops and the fruit was much larger. He considered every tree thus worked worth $20 each, certainly a good price, considering the first cost. In many sections the Virginia crab was used for a stock and in regions farther north the Hibernal was a favorite. The discussion certainly opened a wide range of possibilities. The meeting closed with a good house and intense interest to the end. Two-minute speeches were called for from the members and delegates and there was a rattling of fireworks for one-half hour as wits and con - gratulations were shot forth. All together it was a harmonious and de - lightful meeting. The cause of the remarkable success seems to lie in the fact that the suciety has leaders of superior ability and a harmonious executive board. They take time to deliberate; they lead and the mem - bers follow. There are a few men like Secretary Latham, who is quiet, but wise, and sends out an influence which is felt all through the state. The society very much needs a building of its own, and in the near future we trust it may secure one. </seg>
            <seg id="p217">There is a general impression among the potato growers of Nebraska, particularly among those of the southern part of the state, that it is an advantage to secure seed tubers from the North at least oncey every two or three years. In other words, many potato growers believe tha potato deteriorates when grown in southern Nebraska (rum the sane stock of seed year after year. Experiments carried on at t.e Nebraska Experiment Station, as well as experiments reported frcm other places. indicate that there is a basis for this belief. About five years ago the liment Station secured some Early Ohio potatoes from the Red River country cf .Minnesota, a region which has the reputation of pro - ducing very good seed stock. This same stock of Eariy Onio has been grown at the Experiment Station every year since. Two or three times since getting this original stock we have brought in Red Oliios for com - parison. During the past three or four years, the potatoe stocks direct from the Red River country have yielded decidedly better than the Experiment Station stock, which, as noted above, came originally from the Red River country. In other words, the Red River stock seems to have deteriorated by being grown in the vicinity of Lincoln for a few The explanation commonly offered by potato experts to account Kch deterioration as that noted above when potatoes are grown in uth is something like this. The potato is naturally a cool weather It is supposed to have been native in the high plateaus of ■ntral America. In these regions, while the days are h t the nights variably cool, owing to the elevation. Similar conditions are ap- proached in the northern States of this country. It is certainly true that the potato succeeds better in the cooler climate cf the Northern Si than it does in the warm climate of the extreme Southern States. It is Kly also true that the hottest part of the day is of shorter duration North and that the nights are distinctly cooler. It is also true e soil temperatures are in general lower and doubtless more uni- form in the North. Some years ago it occured to me that if northern-grown seed was Kthan home-grown for the reasons noted above, we might be able w seed tubers in this region successfully by imitating more northern rature conditions. This might be accomplished in part, it was though, by very deep planting, so that the tubers, forming somewhat deeper in the ground, would be subjected to lower and more uniform tern- Keport of the Committee on Vegetables.

            <seg id="p218">218 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY peratures. This method has not been found entirely practical, however. Tubers that form deep in. the ground are much more difficult to dig with - out injury. It was though that possibly hilling up the rows with soil at the last cultivation, as used to be practiced with potatoes, might be an ad - iffe in the same way; but it has been known for a long time that, while hilling up may be good in itself, it is impossible to produce a about the potato plants without getting the dirt from the middle of the rows, and in doing this a large number cf potato roots are cut and ield is likely to suffer materially. The only other method of ac- .ishing what was desired that baa suggested itself to me is the use of a mulch of straw, old hay, or other coarse material. This litter mulch can be spread over the iarfaee i f the ground, either before the plants come up or after they have reached considerable size. It has been found that a straw mulch four inches deep after settling keeps the soil tem - perature a few inches under it almost constant from day to night and ■int within a few degrees from week to week during the summer. On the whole, also, the average soil temperature is considerably lower under the mulch than when bare. The temperature of the air immediate - ly above the mulch, however, fluctuates much more decidedly than it does above bare ground. It is not uncommon to get temperatures from three to five degrees lower at night just above,the surface of a mulch than just above the surface of bare ground similarly located. During the hottest part of the day, on the other band, the temperature immediately above the mulch reaches a point from three to five degrees higher than that above bare ground in the same situation. Potatoes grown by means of a straw mulch then have their roots and the tubers subjected to rather low and very uniform temperatures and their tops to high and particularly to extremely variable temperatures. The mulch, except in protracted dry periods, retains moisture in the soil better than ordinary cultivation, so that the plant has the advantage of a higher percentage of moisture and a more uniform moisture content. Under these conditions cf temperature and moisture, potatoes grown at the Eperiment Station have yielded on the average fully as good crops as when given good cultivation. It is true that in certain cases the yield has been lessened materially, particularly where the stand has been hurt by applying the mulch too deep before the plants came up or by planting the seed tubers to deep so that the plants have lost vitality in pushing up through both the soil and the straw. Where the stand has not been hurt — and it is not usually hurt if the much is applied carefully, and never hurt if the mulch is applied afttr the plants are well up— the yield haa been fully as good a£ where the best cultivation was given. Mulching with coarse stable manure has often increased the yield quite noticeably. The important thing from the standpoint of this paper, however, is the effect of the mulch upon the crop the following year. In every case this effect has been a favorable one. To show that the test was carried on fairly, it may perhaps be well to out line it in some detail. </seg>
            <seg id="p219">PRODUCTION OF POTATO SEED TUBES 219 Some five of six years ago, when the stock of Early Ohio potatoes mentioned in the early part of this paper was obtained from the Red River country, the tubers were planted in the ordinary way on as uniform soil as could be obtained. Later, one-half of the ground planted to this lot of potatoes was mulched with straw and the other half leceived cultivation throughout the summer. In the Fall the potatces from the two plats were dug at the same time, placed in sacks, and kept under the same condtions in a root cellar during the winter. The next spring the two lots were planted on adjoining plats of uniform land, and both plats were given the same cultivation throughout the season. The only diffeient be - tween the two plats, then, was that the seed for one of them had been grown the preceding year under a mulch while the seed for the other had been grown by the ordinary methods of cultivation. When the two plaU were harvested it was found that the plat where the mulched seed stocks of potatoes have been brought in at various times. In each case uniform potatoes are planted, a part of the ground mulched and part cult - vated, the crop harvested and kept under identical conditions over winter, planted on adjoining plats the next year, and given unifoim treatment, ordinarily by cultivation, the following summer, just as was done with the original stock of potatoes. In none of these tests has the cultivated seed given better yields than the mulched seed of the same stock. The mulched stock of any lot has never given less than fifteen percent in - crease in yield over the cultivated lot of the same stock. The average increase in yield due to mulched seed, considering all the tests running over five years, has been something over thirty per cent. It would seem that the experiment has been carried on with suffi - cient care and that it had been carried on sufficiently long so that we can now say with considerable assurance that the increase in yield observed from the use of mulched seed has been due to the better condition under which the seed tubers were grown the preceding year. It being settled that mulching potatoes one year makes stronger seed for the next season, the question arises as to whether this method can be used on the farms of this state. It is probably impossible for the large potato grower to gTow sufficient seed under a mulch to plant his fields the following season, but it does seem perfectly feasible for the ordinary farmer who grows only an acre or two, or not more than five or ten acres at the most, to grow sufficient seed under a mulch for his whole crop. We have found that the labor required to haul straw or hay where the stack is not too far from the potato field and apply it evenly over the surface of the eround is just about equivalent to the time spent in four or five thorough had been used had yielded about forty per cent more than the adjoining plat, where cultivated seed had been planted. The test has been repeated ll .11 ec year since with the original stock of Early Ohio potatoes. Some of the potatoes grown under the mulch one year are mulched the following year and some cultivated, and some of the potatoes grown by cultivation one year are mulched the next year and some of them cultivated In addition to continuing the tests with this original lot of potatoes, new </seg>

On n.any farms there is a surplus of straw or old hay from the tops and bottoms of stacks which could be used for this purpose, so that the cost of t • material need not be considered. Less labor is required to spread tin mulch before the potatoes come up, but a better stand is secured by x ailing until after the plants are well up and placing the straw careful y about them. It is usually necessary to rake off the greater part f the straw before digging the potatoes, which of course adds materia j to the expense of this method of growing them. One ad - vantage fren t e standpoint of the labor which mulching has over culti - vation is tha it can be done at one time and no further attention need be given the pa h so far as tillage is concerned during the season. If a large area w e to be mulched, it would be impossible to do this except when the ground is fairly dry, since loads of straw could not be hauled onto the fieli when wet. In case of the ordinary farmer, who will wish to mulch on i small area, he can mulch say two or three rows along the side of ! it- Id.

Potatoes grown in the North on sandy soil are not supposed to be as good for seed as potatoes grown on heavier soils, potatoes grown in the North by a careless grower, not well cared for, bo that the plants did not mature properly, cannot make as good seed as potatoes grown by a careful grower. In conclusion, then, I would recom - mend to the man who is to grow a small area of potatoes to try produc - ing his seed tubers at home under a little mulch.

All doubt as to the value of spraying for the control of injurious insect and fungus life in the fruit orchards has been removed from the dullest minds, and dwarfed, knotty and wormy fruit has now come to be a reproach upon both the intelligence and industry of the grower. He must obey the law of the universe and adapt himself to the conditions of environment, and his evolution from the thriftless, profitless, unthinking plodded to the brilliantly successful orchardist is fully indicated by the character of the fruit he places on the markets. There is no reasonable excuse for stung and deformed fruit except failure to carry out plans of at this insect alone, since the curculio is not destructive if all present in those sections. Missouri and mid-west fruit growers must, however, make an allowance for an additional and equally important factor — the curculio. There have been, upon the other hand, some very effective plans of sprays advised by entomologists, after expermental trials, to be used on apples with curculio principally in view. Since both in - sects have always to be dealt with in Mississippi valley orchards It seemed that the problem was worthy of further study in perfecting sprays serving both purposes. The orchard spraying problem in Missouri, like many of the mid - west states, is further complicated by the prevalence of several fungous diseases, most prominent of these being apple scab and bitter-rot. In the experiments of the writer these were taken into consideration and insofar as they have bearing upon the sprays for the two insects under discussion they are summarized herewith, in condensed form, easily com - prehended and assimilated: Kng which are already well known to be effective. Throughout iri and the mid-west states there is a strong tendency to more careful and intelligent spraying.

Many entomologists have shown by experiment how it is possible to proceed in controlling the codling moth without reference to the curculio. The remarkably success- ful results of apple growers in the Rocky Mountain, Pacific and north- western states, in controlling codling moth are based upon methods aimed </seg>

The financial rom these two pests in a year when an average crop is bourne its to millions of dollars. The plum curculio is the small, grayish, snout-beetle well known to orchardists, which injures the apple by making small round holes through the skin in feeding and by making the half-moon shaped marks upon the surface of the fruit in egg-laying. There is but a single annual generation. They hibernate in the winter as adult beetles and a, in the orchard shortly after the blooming of the fruit.

Apple growers spray against both curculio and codling moth, modifying their scheme of tieatment for t ea which have also to be combatted A practical spraying experiment was conducted in lftnii upon a block of about twenty acres of Ingram apples in a large commercial Ozark apple orchard for the purposes of showing tile best kind of spray, the proper time to spray and the be.=t way to spray apples to prevent codling moth and curculio injury. Three early sprays resulted in ST.ti per cent picked apples free from curculio crescents while 4T&gt;.."&gt; per cent were damaged on the trees unsprayed. Three early sprays resulted in 99.83 per cent picked apples free from codling moth worm holes. 14.5 per cent being wormy from codling moth on the trees unsprayed. There were 97.4 per cent picked apples free from both kinds of injuries when sprayed three times while unsprayed trees gave only 46.1 per cent free from such blemishes. The three early sprays, by preventing windfalls, ga ner cent more picked apples than the unsprayed trees. When the fruit from the sprayed and unsprayed parts of the orchaid was graded, in - juries from both insects and fungi being considered, and scld it wu found that the spraying had doubled the cash returns from the crop. After deducting the cost of spraying a net profit by virtue of the sprays amounting to $65.36 per acre, was secured. For every dollar expended for spraying $7 were saved in the price secured for the fruit. The pro - fits accruing, though yield of trees was light, was sufficient upon a twen - ty-acre tract to pay in one year for a $300 gasoline power spray outfit and leave more than a thousandd dollars clear gain besides. </seg>

These should be known and DOd by the farmer and fruit grower who have to contend with Nearly all of these lice are rather easily destroyed when proper s are intelligently applied to them. &lt;;»ik thI Structure and Hiililts Kof the plant lice get their food by inserting a beak and sucking of the plant. They never eat away the tissue of the leaf. Throughout the entire summer, from spring to about the fir.-t of September, all of our plant lice that infest orchard trees, increase in numbers by giving bit th to living young. If eggs are laid at all they are dep&lt; sited by the last brood of females in the fall. From the fact that a single louse is usually able to give birth to from seventy-five to 150 young, and as they mature in about eight to ten days after being born, it will readily be seen that the plant lice are capable of increasing with wonderful rapidity. This accounts for the fact that the lice may nearly all be killed from a tree and that tree be very seriously infested with the lice again within a few weeks. Usually the last brood in the fall are about one-half males and one-half females. These females de - posit the eggs that live over winter and the lice all die. We have an exception of this rule, however, in case of the wcoloy apple aphis, which lives over winter as young or partly grown lice upon the trunk of branches, and in all stages of growth upon the roots of the trees. Plant louse eggs usually hatch in the spring a little before the leaf buds begin to open on the trees that they infest. These early lice batching from the eggs are always wingless in the species mentioned in this bulletin, and are called stem-mothers. These stem-mcthers mature In a short time, are all females, and begin giving birth to young lice which consitute the second brood. It is seldom that the second brood of lice have more than a very few winged ones. The remainder of the life history of these lice will be given under the different species treat- AppU- Plant Lice— Wool) Apple Aphis It is a bark feeder, and it attacks both the roots, the trunk and the limbs of the trees, but does not feed upon the fruit or foliage. This louse is readily recognized on account of its being covered with a white woolly secretion which has suggested its common name. Upon the trunk and branches the lice attack either the tender bark about the scars or the bark of tender new shoots. Below ground, the lice attack the bark of the smaller roots, causing warty swelling upon them. If very abundant, the roots are often completely covered with these smooth wart-like growths which sometimes cause the roots to die and rot off. When very abundant upon the very rapidly growing twigs, these lice often produce abrupt swellings due to the thickening of the inner bark. Sometimes the*»e swollen portions of the limbs crack open lengthwise and the </seg>

In using the Mason jars be careful to sterilize them first by placing in cold water, bring to a boil, and boiling for about ten minutes. The rubber and top should also be immersed in boiling water for the same length of time. Remove them from the boiling water when needed, handling as little as possible. Be careful not to put the fingers on the inside of the top or the inner edge of the rubber. Fill the jar with the cooked tomatoes while steaming hot, put on the rubber, screw on the top firmly, invert it, and let it stand in that position until cool. </seg>

They can now be steamed and c us and bring them indoors. By the ugh jars will be emptied to hold mined in th e same way as summer squash. In this way a supply of jars may be made to do double service. Sucontiish The writer has found that a mixture of corn and lima beans, or suc - cotash, is one of the most difficult things to keep. This furnishes one of the very best mediums for bacterial growth; so extreme care must be taken in the process of canning. It is advisable to gather the corn and beans early in the morning and prepare and sterilize them in the manner already described. As with summer squash, it is best to boil for an hour and a half, instead of for an hour. Vegetable bast A rather unusual dish for the winter may be made by canning a mixture of vegetables. Prepare corn, lima beans, tomatoes, string beans, orka, squash, and eggplant as you would for canning separately. Mix these in varying proportions, letting the corn and lima beans predomi - nate. Add two or three medium-sized onions to each quart of this mixture and run all through a food chopper in order to mix it thor - oughly. Pack into jars and sterilize. In preparing for the table with an equal volume of bread crumbs, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and one egg; season to taste with pepper and salt, and bake in a round bak - ing dish until brown. Cut into slices as you would a cake and serve hot with a drawn butter sauce. </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 Corn, okra and tomatoes, mixed, equal proportions, may be canned in this way as a soup stock. Freshness of Flavor and Color Vegetables when canned properly should retain their attractive color and lose very little of their flavor. It will be found almost im - &lt;le to detect any difference either in taste or in appearance be - tween the canned and the fresh article if these directions are carefully - followed. The volatile oils which give flavor to most vegetables are not lost during this process of sterilization. Cooking for three short periods in a closed container at a comparatively low temperature in - stead of cooking for short periods at a high temperature or for one long period in an open vessel makes the vital difference and insures freshness of flavor and color. After the jars have been sterlized and tested, they should be kept in the dark, as the sunlight will soon destroy the color of the vegetable. How To Open • Jar Jars of vegetables are sometimes hard to open, unless it is done in just the right way. Run a thin knife blade under the rubbar, next to the jar, and press against it firmly. This will usually let in enough air to release the pressure on the top. In case it does not, place the Jar in a deep saucepan of cold water, bring to a boil, and keep it boiling for a few minutes. The jar will then open easily. Cautions Kese directions for canning apply only to pint and quart jars. If lion jars are used, always increase the time of boiling, making it r and a half instead of one hour. Do not go into canning too deeply at first. Experiment with a few- Jars in the early part of the season and see if they keep well. It is not a difficult matter to can vegetables properly. The writer has never lost a can of string beans, okra, eggplant, carrots, parsnips, lima beans, beets, asparagus, or pumpkin in several years' experience, and has had only one can of peas spoil, a few cans of corn during the earlier trials, and a few cans of succotash. Any housewife can do equally well. If you fol - low the directions here given carefully, you will have no difficulty whatever. If you should happen to fail in the first trial, rest assured that you have done something wrong or left something undone. No housewife who has on hand during the winter a supply of home-canned vegetables ready to serve on ten minutes' notice will ever regret the trouble or difficulties experienced in learning.

Many of them have already purchased materials and machinery for this purpose. Some growers have not as yet been troubled with the rot and are loth to go to the ex - pense of spraying until there is more evidence for the necessity. If they are located at some distance from infested vineyards, they will probably not be troubled for a season or two. But it must be remem - bered that many of the growers who have suffered severe losses the last year were not troubled prior to two years ago, and many had never seen the rot in their vineyards before. The rot can be kept under control much easier if taken in hand early than if allowed to gain a strong foot - hold in the vineyard it requires two years' spraying before the most profitable results can be secured.

The machine should pass both sides of row.

This great loss is due to care than to any other ca ind unintelligent handling rather Delicate Structure of Trees In the first place, trees are not the non-destructible organisms one would be led to think they weie, from the way one so often sees them handled. On the contrary, trees are made up of delicate organs, which are very subject to adverse conditions, and, like other living forms, readily show the result of favorable or harmful environments. The part of a tree above ground, because it is always subject to changing conditions of weather, has acquired the power of accommodat - ing itself to a considerable range of conditions. Hardy trees can : and accommodate themselves to a very wide range of temperat The root environment of a tree is of a very different nature from the con - ditions above ground. The more dense nature of the soil covering about the roots of trees makes them less susceptible to sudden changes than the air-exposed parts. For this reason, the rcots are much more tender and easily injured than the branches of a tree. Branches cannot en - dure root environment, nor can roots endure branch environment — and yet we often see trees exposed at planting time, as if the roots would stand whatever the tops would. In addition to these conditions of environment, roots have delicate organs, known as root-hairs, that maintain their life only under con - ditions of moisture. These root-hairs, as their name implies, are fine and hair-like — so fine, indeed, that one needs a microscope to see them perfectly. They have exceedingly thin and delicate cell-walls, and con - tain the active protoplasm on which the life of the tree depends. It is by the osmotic action of the delicate walls of the root-hairs that the tree is able to get its food from the soil. As might be seen from their nature, root-hairs are very easily injured and killed by drying. Unless they are constantly in contact with moist soil particles, they die, and the leaves of the tree above the ground quickly tell of the loss below the surface. Koot-Huirs </seg>

It is upon these delicate little organs that the life of a tree de - pends, and its growth and vigor is proportionate to their activity and numbers. Yet one would scarcely believe that there was anything deli - cate about the roots of trees, to see the way they are exposed by some Hi cliiiL'-lii and ((Mcrini: From the time trees leave the nursery row until they are permanent - ly planted, they should be exposed Just as little as possible. They should never be left open to sun or wind or air, when it can at all be avoided. Trees should not be laid out while holes are dug, nor under ordinary circumstances should those for a whole row be laid out at one time. - waiting for planting should be heeled-in with moist earth about the roots, and only taken out of the ground when actually needed for setting. To save time when planting, trees may be placed in a wagon and covered with wet straw or fertilizer sacks. As the planting proceeds, the trees can be taken singly from the wagon as wanted. This treatment just out - lined stands in striking contrast to the plan, or lack of plan, where tree roots are exposed for hours to the injurious effects of the sun and wind. Moreover, th e success as shown by vigorous living trees will stand in striking contrast to the results of the planting where trees are not care - fully cover. Transplanting Seedlings If a tree could be taken out of the ground without the loss of root - hairs, it could be transplanted without dropping a leaf. If it were plant - ed in as good a soil as that from which it was taken, the tre e would never know that it has been transplanted. The loss of trees in transplanting is largely in proportion to the loss of root-hairs. It is possible with careful handling to prevent exposure, to transplant thousands and thousands of seedlings without the loss of a single tree. The larger the tree to be transplanted, the necessarily greater loss of root surface; yet, with care, laige trees may be moved even in summer without the loss of foliage. Transplanting Larce Trees. Last July, to make place for a new building, my foreman trans - planted a large and valuable evergreen without the loss of a single cone. He first soaked the ground thoroughly about the roots to make the earth cling to them ; then he dug a great circle about the tree and undermined It. raising it out of the hole on timbers, and carefully skidded it to a new hole dug to receive it. The crevices were carefully packed in with earth and the hole filled and leveled up to the surface. The ground was kept moist about the tree, and as the root-hairs were never exposed, the tree showed not the slightest inconvenience from this transplanting. </seg>

Perhaps the farmer is not prepared to plant the trees, and they heat or dry in the ■boxes while he is digging the holes. Making a Tree ( omfortable. In planting a tree to make it grow — and there should be no other aim — the tree should be made just as comfortable in its new environment as possible. If the land is wet it should be diained, for trees will never thrive with wet feet. The best results are obtained by preparing the The hole dug for a tree should be large enough go that the roots may be spread out naturally in all directions. Yet it is not necessary to dig very wide holes if the trees are heavy-rooted, for the roots of a tree always need trimming back at transplanting time. Cut back all roots larger than a lead-pencil, leaving a clean-cut surface. Remove all broken or lascerated roots and those that have become dried and dead. The cut surface should always show fresh, living wood. When these surfaces come in contact with moist soil the cambium grows out over the end and forms a callus, from which new roots start very In trimming the roots it is best to make a sloping cut, with the cut surfaces facing downward. When such a tree is set, the cot surfaces will always come in contact with the soil, and the callus forma readily. It is thought by some that the cut surfaces facing downward cause the \urserj Trent mint In taking trees from nurseries and preparing them for shipment, must necessarily be more or less exposure of the roots, but reliable nurserymen take care that this exposure is the least possible. If properly handled, the trees are loosened in the ground with a digger or spade, and the roots not removed from the ground till the trees are to be bunched and loaded on wagons. The loads are co' with canvas while going to the packing-sheds or heeling-in gruunds. ■ng boxed they are packed in with (lamp straw and peat, and if d long distances the boxes are lined with waxed paper. Reliable ymen, who well understand the delicate nature of tree roots, and who guarantee to fill in gaps the second season, take good care to. see that trees are carefully handled and packed. It is usually at the other B previous year for the setting of the trees. Clover or cowpeas d under in the fall will make humus the following year and keep lil moist about the roots. Trees will often do well in poor soils and unfavorable conditions if good scil is placed about their roots, so that they get a good start the first year or so.

As the tree is lined up. it .should be placed so that the large or main roots are in line with the prevailing wind. It will be noticed by those handling that the largest or main roots usually grow in directly opposite directions from the base of the trunk, and seldom at right angles to each other. These large roots form a sort of root axis, and are some - known as the brace-roots of the tree. If care is taken in setting the tree, bo that the brace-roots are in line with the prevailing wind, the tree will be firmly fixed and not easily affected by storms. If, on tbe other hand, the main root axis is placed at right angles to the pre - vailing wind, the top is rocked backward and forward, as if on a hinge. Attention to this point will save many trees. The neglect of it is often seen where the collar of the tree works a hole three or four inches across. This, of course, causes great loss of moisture and injury to the roots. Trees should usually be tilted a few degrees towards the direc - tion of the prevailing wind. The riiintiiiir-Koiinl. One of the quickest and most accurate methods of setting trees is by the use of the planting-board. This board is usually about six feet long and four inches wide. It has a hole bored near either end, and on the middle of one side, exactly between these holes, a notch cut about half - way through the width of the board. When the ground is staked out and everything ready for planting, the planting-board is placed so that natch is close al&gt;out a stake where a tree is to be set. Iron or wooden pins are thrust through the two holes of the board; then the board is lifted off one pin and thrown around on the other, out of the way. The hole is tlien dug, and when the board is swung around and dropped over the first pin the notch will indicate exactly where the is to be set. By beveling the notch a trifle, the slope to the pre - vailing winds may be Riven by fitting the tree every time into the notch. This method is rapid and so accurate that orchards may be put in on straight lines without the trouble of sighting the trees. Filling in the Holes. This is the most important step in the whole operation. To get the best results, moist soil must be placed closely about the roots, so that there are no air holes or crevices. The best instrument for accomplish - ing this work is the human hand. When the tree is placed in position the roots are spread opt and a shovelful or two of the finest and best earth thrown upon them.

Fletcher, Director of the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station (Abstract of address before the American Pomological Society September 15, 1909.) The barrel has been the standard and almost the only package for winter apples for over half a century. It has several distinct advan - tages. Owing to its rounded sides, it can be packed easily and rapidly, even by the unskilled, and, for the same reason, it can be handled more easily by rolling than any other package of equal bulk. Until within ten years it has also been a cheap package. Now barrels cost most fruit growers from 30 cents to 40 cents, instead of 15 to 30 cent* as formerly. The apple barrel is an eastern package, and is made of hardwood, usually of elm and oak, which are more common in the east than in the west. History of the Box Package, The appe box, on the other hand, is a western package. Open bushel boxes have long been used in the east for shipping vegetables and early apples. The closed box has also been used, somewhat, by a few individuals, notably by L. Woolverton, of Grimsby, Ont., who was exporting wrapped apples in bushel boxes, 12S apples to the box, fifteen years ago. But the real introduction of the apple box as a commercial package for winter apples is coincident with the rise of commercial apple growing in the Pacific coast states within the past fifteen years. The prototype of the apple box is the orange box. The Pacific coast apple growers face conditions that have made the box, rather than the barrel, their almost exclusive apple package. The most important condition is their great distance from markets, and consequent high transportation charges. -It costs 50 cents to raise a bushel of Hood river apples, and 50 cents more to lay it down in New York. This makes it imperative to economize space, and the box packs tighter in a car than the barrel, especially the old fashioned barrel with a three or four-inch bulge. Kit the most important effect of the great distances and high rates en on the grading of the fruit. There would be no profit in paying high transportation charges on inferior fruit Only fruit that ell at the top of the market will justify the outlay. This means lly graded fruit, fully as much as high quality fruit. The box ;e enforces careful grading. The shiftless "shuffle packing" i* </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY still used in gome parts of the west, but in most cases apples packed in boxes are placed tier upon tier. This in expensive, but the cost of grading is small compared with the cost of getting the fruit to mar - ket, and the returns usually justify the outlay. The points to be noted are that great distance from markets and high transportation charges have forced the western fruit grower to grade more carefully than his rn competitor, and that the bushel, in which uniformity is im - perative, has thus become the distinctive package. Another condition that has had some influence is the fact that Kift woods predominate in the w&lt; &gt;arrel is a hardwood package; boxes are now being made in but they are decidedly inferior of the west, not only b. st, and the hardwoods in the the box is a softwood package, the east from poplar and yellow to the fir. spruce and white pinn they are heavier and more rigid. Iso because they come in narrower widths. The bushel apple box most logical and fitting package that the we-t could d 1 the material at hand. In view of the rapid reduction of our il forests, we must expect to soon face the necessity of forest ulture. The soft woods, being more rapid in growth, will I and more cheaper than the hardwoods, hence the barrel will tend ome more and more costly, as compared with the box. IMl'Ii Prices for Western Box Fruit Eastern apple growers have been more or less nettled, and their ambition stimulated, by the high prices received for western box fruit in recent years. It is rather galling to eastern men to see a bushel box of Washington or British Columbia apples selling for the same price as his own three-busbel barrel. It relieves him somewhat to dilate upon the superior "quality" and "flavor" of his own fruit, but the i goes right on paying the same discriminating prices. The easterner is apt to then lay the blame for his own low prices on the type of pack - ages he uses. The truth, however, is that the high prices received for western box fruit are due chiefly to superior grading, and very little to superior quality or to a more convenient type of package. In other words, the higher price is payment for the superior skill and enterprise of the grower rather than for any special natural endowments of soil and climate that have made it possible to produce unusually good fruit. When a buyer pays $3 a box for Hood river Spitzenburgs, and $4 a barrel \&gt;w York Spitzenburgs, he is paying, not necessarily for superior quality of fruit, nor for a superior type of package, but for superior grading. The comparison, therefore, is not so much between the box and the barrel as a type of package, as between western grading and eastern grading. ts as unwise for the eastern apple grower to adopt the package western apple grower without careful consideration as it has to be unwise for the west to adopt the varieties and cultural of the east without change. In the past five years many of </seg>
            <seg id="p245">THE BOX PACKAGE; ITS USE AND LIMITATIONS 245 E stern apple growers have tried the box package. There have been failures than successes. It is evident that the east is not yet for the box as a universal apple package; that under certain cms the barrel is far preferable. Each grower must decide this for himself, having in mind the following points: Comparison of Box and Barrel. 1. Quantity of Fruit. — It is probably true that the box is a more convenient quantity of fruit for the "ultimate consumer," who has re- cently received so much attention by tariff makers, than the barrel. ■30 per cent of our population now live in cities, and the percentage y dwellers is increasing with each census. A majority of the city Bwn people, constituting the main market for fruits, have no cool in which fruit can be stored. Their storage facilties are limited refrigerator. They wish to buy only such a quantity of fruit 1 keep at the ordinary temperature of the house while being used. Under such conditions the box is a more convenient package than the barrel. A large basket of the Climax type, holding about a peck, would be more convenient still, especially for summer and autumn apples. On the other hand, there is a large demand for apples in bigger bulk, not only because of the custom of years, but also for the winter supply of Kwho have a cool cellar, and for export. Certain varieties carry across the water in barrels than in boxes, because the latter permit the entrance of salt air Cost of Packages. — On the Pacific coast apple boxes cost from 6 to 9 cents, knocked down. As three boxes can be packed out of one barrel, at that price the boxes are cheaper than the barrel. In the east we pay from 11 to 21 cents per box. In Virginia boxes cost 10 to 12 Montreal states that his boxes cost 21 cents. The price of barrels in the east, this fall, ranges from 30 to 45 cents, with an average of about 35 cents. Bought knocked down in carload lots they have cost certain growers 28 to 29 cents. The inferior quality of some eastern made boxes. as noted previously, should also be considered. The comparative cost of barrels and boxes is a local problem, and each grower will have to get estimates. Grading and Packing.— The fundamental difference between the two types of packages is here. The box encourages, and almost en- forces, uniform grading, while the barrel permits carelessness in this respect. The cost of packing is also an item. Where a very large quantity of fruit is packed by specially trained men, it costs little if any more for labor to pack in boxes than in barrels. But the small grower, and especially one who has been accustomed to the barrel pack. will find that it costs from one-third to one-half more to pack in boxes than in barrels. It should be noted also that very small, or otherwise inferior fruit, seldom if ever yields as high returns in the box pack as in the barrel pack Only the large sizes go well in boxes, whether cents, in Minneapolis, Minn., 14 cents, while Mr. Robert Brodie of </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY he can get more by sorting out his fancy and No. 1 stock for boxing, and selling the smaller fruit in barrels, than to sell all in barrels as No Is. Another point to be considered is the shape of the fruit. It is almost imperative that box fruit should be quite regular in shape. Lopsided and mis-shapen fruit, like the York, especially from young trees, would not pack well in boxes. The most important point under this beading, however, is that no one has ever succeeded with the box pack using common stock. Only fancy and No. 1 fruit of the best quality has paid in boxes. By intensive methods, and especially by thin - ning the young fruit on the trees, many of the best western growers have been able to produce fruit 95 per cent of which is fancy. Prac - tically all of the Hood river fruit is box fruit. I doubt if, on an average, 30 per cent of the apple crop of Virginia, or Ontario, or any ether part of the east, is box or fancy fruit. This point must be kept emphatically in mind when the suggestion is made that the box should become the exclusive apple package of the east, as it is now in the 4. Quality of Fruit. — Of far less importance than the grade of the fruit in the package, in respect to the question before us, is its quality. It is a fact, however, that the box fruit that has commanded the highest prices is mostly of varieties of high quality — Winesap, Spitzen - burg, Newtown. But other varieties, even some of very indifferent quality, have been sold in the box package to great advantage, showing that the style of package and the grade of fruit, rather than ts flavor, are the deciding factors. However, the general experience has been that the better quality of the fruit, the more apt it is to pay in the box pack. If varieties of inferior quality pay in the box pack, it is because the style of package and the grading outweigh the deficiency in quality. Experience With the Box Package in East. Having in mind the essential difference between the box and the barrel trade, it does not seem strange that most of the attempts to use the box in the east have not resulted saisfacorily. It is probably near the truth to say that eight out of every ten trials of the apple box in the east have been unsuccessful. A notable example is an experiment by the field pomologist of the United States Department of Agriculture, Mr. W. A. Taylor, several years ago. He sent abroad during two seasons, eight carloads of carefully graded boxed Baldwin, York and Newton, but with indifferent results as compared with barrels. There are many possible reasons for these failures. I Custom. — Custom is hard to change, and the box package is an ation in the east. As a rule, eastern buyers and grocers do not forward with favor upon the box, partly because the profits in king and selling a barrel of indifferently packed apples are apt greater than in handling three well packed boxes. If the producer deal direct with the consumer it would be different. There is &gt;ubt but that a majority of the consumers prefer the box, or a er package, if the fruit did not cost much more. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">THE BOX PACKAGE; ITS USE AND LIMITATIONS 247 2. The Market. — A good deal depends upon what a certain market prefers in the matter of fruit packages as well as in fruit varieties. Iitions of men who have packed in barrels, using "facers" and s" have descended to the fruit growers of today and many of find it extremely difficult to keep the smaller, poorly colored, or y imperfect specimens from gravitating to the bottom of the It will take a generation or two, perhaps, to breed out that habit. testern man deserves no credit for being more honest In this t for, as has been pointed out, honesty was not merely the best for him, but the only policy that would pay freight rates.

Eith respect to the market the fruit grower must recognize the nt demands of two entirely different types of markets.

Some buyers want their fruit in boxes, and others prefer barrels, according to the market they expect to reach. The grower who ships should be equally wise. 3. Poor Packing and Grading. — More failures arise from this cause ■from any other.

Moreover, the habits of several </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY common stock. The other, the special or fancy, will pay a fancy price for fancy stock. At the present time the box package supplies the special or fancy market almost exclusively, while the barrel package supplies both, but more especially the common or general market. These two classes of market will always exist, or as long as some people are more successful in accumulating money than others. It goes without saying that the demand for cheap or common fruit, at a fair price, will continue to be very much greater than the demand for fancy fruit at a high price, because there are many more people who are in moderate circumstances than there are people who are able to pay fancy prices for fruit. The proportion of fruit growers who are able to grow fancy fruit is as small as the proportion of consumers who are able to pay fancy prices. Location, soil, and the varieties best adapted thereto may make it more profitable to grow staple varieties for the common market. This cheap fruit — the main supply of the great middle class of people — will be marketed in barrels to best advantage for many years to The successful marketing of apples in boxes depends so much upon skillful grading and packing and upon the possession of a large quantity of fruit so packed, that it seems likely that very little impetus will be given to box packing in the east except through co-operative shipping associations. Here and there an exceptional grower may find it profitable to pack fancy grades of certain varieties in boxes, but it does not seem probable that box packing will make much headway in the east except through the co-opeiative shipping associations, with their trained business manager and their trained crews of trained These conclusions indicate that the eastern fruit grower should be a conservative on the subject of the box apple package. The drift is to - wards the smaller package, but at the present time, and for many years to come, apple growers who are so situated that they must produce apples for the general or common markets — which means a majority of the growers — will find the barrel more profitable. With the advent of co-operative shipping associations the box package will become more and more common in the east, and eventually even for the common grades of fruit. — [National Horticulturist, November, 1909.] </seg>

We assume that you know you are welcome to these grounds and buldings, because we are all citizens of the itate of Nebraska, and these buildings belong to you as much as to any of There are particular reasons, however, why I am very glad to wel- come you to the State Farm at this time. 1 feel that the work in horti- culture in this state has made much advancements since the last time you inn in annual meeting here in this room. The Horticultural [tone some very good work during the past year, and in fact has all alon doing a veiy good work, but it is net my purpose to hand a b to the society. There are reasons enough around here why 1 need not do that. One of the reasons is that I cannot do it well encugh, and another ason is that you all know as well and better than 1 do what you have ■ loing. One of the reasons why 1 am particularly glad to welcome &gt;ou memh Horticultural Society to tlie State Farm at this time is that I want you to know more about the work we are doing here at the farm. We have made some definite advancement along the lines ( f horticulture la the past few years, and in this work our new men here at the State Farm have had a large part of it. We have a new man here in the landscape garden department; some of you have met him and some of you have not. Some years ago there was only one person here who fi full charge of the work in horticulture. Now there are five men ley are giving their entire time to this work. Most of you know estgate, who is a member of this society. He has been added to the heie at the farm, he is very much interested in the work of the horticultural department and will be glad to show any of you around whenever you have time to go with him. We have a new man, Mr. Bui, here in the landscape gardening department. I want all of you ere to meet him and get acquainted with him. He is giving his en - me to the beautifying of this campus and the whole grounds and .mpus down at the University in the city. We have several new men here and you should get acquainted with all of them. I want to tell you also that in coming here for your annual meeting Iou are coming to an institution where horticultural instruction is given this year to more than five hundred students. About half of umber are receiving instruction in the long course in the School riculture. Some are not receiving actual horticultural instruction ear because the courses are not given this year. In the Summer 1. where we have a number of the shorter courses, many more are ered. Then too, as many of you already know, we have been carry- ing on work in the orchards of this state; that is, spraying work. This work has been dene in a number of counties, and includes some fourtenn orchard in all. We fell that this work has been of much good to show what can be done and also in keeping the orchards in good shape. And this work where it has been done for a number of years is of much </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY been to the particular communities, of course, but we want to continue this work in spraying so that the horticultural interests and the orchard interests of the state will be brought closer together and also be brought up to a higher standard. There are many things too besides spraying that should be done in connection with the horticultural work in Nebraska, and in this connection the men representing the Department of Horticul - ture here at the State Farm are devoting their entire time throughout the winter months and school season to spreading the doctrine of horticulture. Our orchards and homes can be made much more profitable and beauti - ful and the surroundings of the farm home can also be made more beauti- The increased beauty ot tne campus around here is probably one of the first things that yuu will notice as you come in. Our plans are to make this campus the most beautiful spot in the state of Nebraska. The state certainly can afford to make this campus beautiful. Any education - al institution should have the best possible surroundings, but there is a reason why this particular educational institution should have such surroundings. That is because of the large number of young men and women from over the whole state who come here to school, it will give them something to take home with them. We know that many things can be grown successfully in all parts of the state, and in some parts at the state many more things can be grown than people imagine. Our climate for the whole state may not be as favorable as that of some other states, but it is not bad. It is along this line of work that we are engaged here at the state farm, and we want the help of the Horticultural Society. So I am especially glad to welcome the society to the state farm at this time, for we are all working along the some line. The President: Professor Emerson's welcome to us is surely most welcome. I believe I voice the sentiment of all the members of this society when I fay that we are always glad to come to the State Farm for Kieeting.

Son: t p) The President: We will now have the Secreary REPORT OF SECRETARY. In connection with my duties as secretary during the past year, the best indication that horticultural work and interest in Nebraska is grow - ing is the continued increasing demand for our annual reports and bulle - tins. This growing demand for horticutural information is due no doubt in a large degree to the efforts and results accomplished in the work of the Farmers' Institutes. It is through these Insitutes and lec - tures that the right class of people are reached and interested in our work. As has been suggested several times in our meetings, this in - terest in horticulture should be maintained and pushed still further to in - clude the younger men, those who expect to come to the State Farm to schoc.l. They should be shown the direct value and practical side of horticulture along with their other agricultural studies and work. Iince our last meeting I have sent out 8675 of our annual reports, number includes many of our old back reports, which for several have been stored in the room of the State Historiacl Society at niversity. And of all these reports sent out nearly all of them have direct to the Farmers' Institutes. And now that the number of utes is increasing so rapidly, we will not be able to furnish as many ts as heretofore. It will be necessary to either cut down on the Jo not realize that tiiig may be a confined tc </seg>
            <seg id="p256">256 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY number of Institutes to which reports are sent or send fewer reports to all the meetings. I believe the latter plan be better, to send fewer re - ports, but send them to practically all of the Institutes. Aside from this large number of annual reports sent out, something over 2.000 of our bi - monthly bulletins have been mailed. The demand for these bulletins is constantly increasing. Occasionally it is necessary to print an extra number of seme of the bulletins, which may be of more than ordinary in - interest, such as the repoit of the State Entomologist. As has been brought out many times during the past few years, one of the must important problems which our society has to deal with is that of membership. We do not have a large enough membership roll. Al - though we are in a fairly gocd condition financially, still we do not do the good we could if we had members. I would be in favor of adopting a new method of securing members, probably some plan patterned after the Minnesota way of getting new members. There they have horti - cultural lecturers in connection with their Farmers' Institutes, who solicit membership at the time of the lectures and demonstrations. Dur - ing one of their seasons recently, by this method, they secured 361 new - members for their Horticultural Society. In connection with this report I have one recemmendation. which I would like to suggest. I will make it as a suggestion simply to get it be - fore the society for discussion. That is in regard to a State Inspection Law for injurious insects and insect deseases. While we may not just now regard Nebraska as important enough in commercial horticulture to warrant such a step, still something should be done along this line soon. Nearly all of our neighboring states have some constitu - tional requirements on this subject of trees and fruit being frcm in - jurious insects and insect diseases. Professor Bruner informs me that the Brown-tailed Moth is being reported as distributed through the eastern part of the United States, and that it has come probably from shipments of stock from France. In this or other cases, good inspection laws, fully enforced, would guard against much damage that might re- Two members of our Society have died during the past year, Theo - dore Williams, of Benson, and W.

Bechtel, of Hamburg, Iowa, is the duly appointed and accredited delegate of the Iowa State Horticultural Society to the annual Meeting of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society at Lincoln, Nebraska, January, 1909. W. M. BOMBERGER. President of Iowa State Horticultural Society By unanimous vote of the society, Mr. Bechtel was made an Annual Honorary member of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society. Mr. Bechtel: Mr. Chairman and members of the Nebraska Horti - cultural Society: I am not going to make a speech, but I want to thank you for this honor, which you have just extended to me. I had the pleasure of attending your last meeting, and I must say that I derived a great deal of benefit from it. I came over here just to get some items of Interest and information, and I am being satisfied. 1 have nothing further to say just at present, but I hope to have the privilege of Just sitting here and taking in the talks and discussions. All of us have many interests in common, and I want to get all the information I can while I am here. Over in our section of the country we are getting up considerable interest in horticulture by the organizaions of local associa- I live only four miles from the Nebraska line and a short dis - tance from the Missouri state line, and we have a good local association there. We had a very successful meeting this fall and a good fruit show too, and we are looking for a continual increase of interest along hort - cultural lines. But all I want to do now is to listen to the papers and a that are going on here. Thank you. ■ he President: I know I can say for our society that we are very to have Mr. ISechtel here with us, and we hope that he will feel me here in our meetings and take put in the discussions, too.

QIKSTIOX BOX. No. I. Why have we lost nearly all of our plum and cherry trees? Mr. Marshall: I do not know what killed them, but they were prob - ably troubled with different diseases. There are several causes. One of the principal reasons probably is because some persons, when plant - ing an orchard are always trying to get something for nothing. I think that is the cause of most of the trouble with the tree business. When a person expects to get something for nothing he is usually disappointed. I have noticed that the European plum trees have died where the Amer - ican plums have lived. The Kuropean plums seem to be more troubled with what is known as s'.iot-hole fungus, and this is caused principally by neglect and wet weather. If we had a series of good dry years we would not have any of this trouble. We have got to use judgment in this, and have got to study the question out. In the case of cherry trees some varieties kill worse than others. Two or three wet seasons will kill the Early Richmond, and five or six seasons of this kind of weather will kill almost any of the other varieties. Mr. Brown: This disease of the cherry trees is one of the things that Prof. Bruner is trying to work out at the present time. To my mind it is no more shot-hole fungus than anything else. As Mr. Marshall says this disease is due to wet weather and also to a poor condition and also due to neglect of orchards. We have sprayed for this disease, but during the three seasons we lost about nine thousand nursery trees. t Member: Mr. Chairman, I asked that question because I would know what is the cause of this disease. I noticed that the leaves dropping off the trees about the middle of the summer. I sprayed es. Mr. Marshall: Spraying would not do any good if the leaves had all fallen off. We did considerable spraying but without any success. We </seg>

I believe the time is coming when we will be able e with these diseases and have a good deal less trouble and not Another thing that we must pay particular attention to subject of cultivation.

That is ■st way that I know of to eliminate the commission man. What are the best methods of renovating our orchards? Mr. Stephens: Some years ago a number of our older orchards were run down a good deal, and a neglected orchard is certainly bad.

How do you prepare the beds for tulips, daffodils and lilies? Mr. Williams: For tulip beds I manure quite freely. Spade down good and deep and then set your bulbs in at a certain depth. My e\ ence has been that with tulips, hyacinths, etc., about four inches below the surface is all right. If you put them down so the tops will be about four inches below the surface I think they will come out all right. Never cover your beds too soon in the fall. Wait until the ground is frozen thoroughly before your put the top dressing on. Then a good covering will keep the ground frozen all winter. And when you take the top dressing off in the spring don't be in too much of a hurry to do this. Leave the covering on as long as possible. No. 2.

I think that we should have every man who poses as a tree agent put on record, require him to have a certicate showing that he is competent by training as a horticulturist and also showing that he is all right morally too. I think every tree agent should be competent and able from every standpoint to sell trees. RESOLUTION The following resolution was read and referred to the Legislative </seg>

This bulletin, the result of years of observation, is designed to aid the nurseryman as well as the amateur and it should be a great help in home adornment. In the tremendous advance of horticulture we are not to lose sight of the susceptibilities of the phlox. Kiere are two ways for the improvement of plants. Save the seeds best, give the plants the best possible care, keep sowing seeds of ry best year after year, and you are sure of some gain. Inother way is to hybridize or cress the different kinds, then select ;ry choicest. The last is the surest way of success. As like begets there will be no very striking variation, so the former process is If you raise lilacs from seed for instance, and have only the ris or common kinds to work on, you cannot make much head-way, the other hand you have twenty kinds planted close together and pes mix the pollen then you are doing something. We have several iorts secured in this way and hope for some satisfactory results. When you begin to hybridize there is a tendency to revert to the </seg>

A group of a thousand seedlings with that wonderful blend of color is a attractive spectacle. Planted in beds in separate colors it is very con- spicuous. I am more and more impressed with the fact that ther surpri 'itv yet to be evolved from these winsome flowers Local and Climatic Influence Phloxes should be sheltered from our fierce, hot winds, and U Bn a dry time they should be well watered. If you cannot do this rrigate with the hoe and cultivator. Never plant on a ridge but leep depression or shallow furrow. If you plant Irises too deep rill rot.

If you grow peonies they come up the second or third year and then you must wait from 3 to 5 years, perhaps longer for them to bloom. With phloxes it is different.

Shade-trees planted along the walk in cities and towns that are naturally devoid of such trees, should be encouraged as they not only add value to the premises where they are planted, but affords shelter, shade and comfort. A more uniform system of planting should be ob - served, both as to the variety of trees and size of same. People have different ideas about these things, and what one man likes as to variety, another does not like and as to size, what one would call a switch, another might call a saw-log. We believe our Nebraska statutes allow in the government of cities and towns village boards and city councils the right in the laying out of the same, to plant uniformly over such town or city upon the streets there of trees and to tax the expense of the same to the lot or kits upon which they are planted. Had this been done ..". of :;&lt;&gt; years ago. in cities and towns of Nebraska, laid out at the time and properly cared for, the same cities and towns would now present a different appearance, and a commercial value much increased. For planting there is no variety of trees so well suited to the purpose as the "Old Settler's Ellum." This tree can be grown successfully in nearly every part of the state and will adapt itself to almost any soil or climate. As a shade tree for the street this should be planted liberally.

Many people think only of the rapidity of growth overlooking more desirable qualities. ■ have only been introduced within the last few years and have reached no great size. The Poplar like the Cottonwood will doubtless prove to be a great robber of the soil, and will interfere with the growth of anything planted near it. The growth of all the above varieties will be much increased by a liberal supply of water and cultivation. During the years from 1878 to 1891 inclusive, a short period of thirteen years, while the timber culture law was in operation, in nearly every section of the state were planted to the extent of 27,000 trees. Had all these ten - acre lots of trees planted at that time grown and were alive today, what a forest we now should have had.

The warm March and fore part of April brought the trees in bloom early, then the noted cold wave that followed, did its destructive work and came the nearest putting us out of the fruit business that we have ever been before since our country has been old enough to produce fruit. Apples and plums suffered the most.

We were able to pick 310 bushels o^ Grimes Golden apples from a few feet less than two - fifths of an acre. Curiously, on level land, a little higher and not far away, the crop was lessened by this cold wave, leaving us perhaps a half crop in that division. In some neighborhoods, a fair crop of peaches was secured. Apparently the question of the crop was determined by elevation, protection from the cold wind or other favorable conditions. In the southern portion of the district, quite a number of peaches grown and a few apples. We may say. however, regarding the peach crop that the large amount of wet weather in mid summer was very favorable to the development of fungous diseases and where a fair crop of peaches was set on the trees, the results were not aB favorable as during the dryest summers. Given excellent cultivation, we can retain a sufficient amount of moisture to develop a fair crop of fruit. In case of excessive rain fall, as during the past summer, we are more liable to fungous diseases than during our dry years.

Hum Iindoz, native, best early; DeSoto, hardy, small tree, live only four i years; Wyant, best of all American; Rollingstone, hardy, wind - ; DeSoto, not quite hardy; Rockford, hardy but diseased plums; Rue, not hardy; Wolf, hardy, thin bearer; Klondike, fine, like DeSoto; Snook, hardy, large coarse plum; Bixley, fine, early, than DeSoto. All Peaches, Wild Goose, Chickasaw and Japanese winter kill, so it is useless to buy or plant them. Glass Seedling and Green Gage, hardy and bear when grafted on Sandoz. Pears Kemish Beauty, Birkett, Warner, Lawrence, Lincoln, Gakowsky, •lianka, Duchess, are all hardy and show no sign of blight. Kiefer kills. Apples Klorence, Grant. Martha and Withney are all hardy and bear heavily; Yellow transparent, Hyslop, Duchess, Aldenburg, Longfield, Janet, or, but Wealthy, Ben Davis, Delicious, Gano, Northwest Greening, 11 the Ben Davis family, winter kill. I therefore recommend for planting for Northwest Nebraska: Cherries Dyehouse, Early Morello, Wragg. Hums Sandoz, Bixley, Klondike, Wyant. Pears Flemish Beauty, Birkett, Warner, Lawrence, Lincoln. Apples Blorence, Martha, Hyslop, Duchess, Longfield, Senator, Yellow Trans t and Whitney. All the above varieties will bear fruit on any farm land without irrl </seg>

Of small fruit, currants, gooseberries, dewberries, June berries, Cardinal raspberries and Snyder blackberries can be raised anywhere. I also call the attention of the people that West Nebraska has yet 1 free homestead lands, that will raise, corn, cattle and alfalfa, lso all above kinds of fruits, and I think that West Nebraska is adapted to cherries, plums and pears than the eastern part, with i a close second. Plums and cherries in four to six weeks later than iaha, and can be raised to the extent of 400 bushels per acre, with selection of trees and West Nebraska will in a short time outdo ido because we have better lands and more rainfall. Thanking you for your past support I am Yours respectfully, JULES A. SANDOZ. Haigler, Nebraska, January, 1910. Gentlemen of the State Horticultural Society: In attempting to make a report we feel somewhat at a loss what to say for we have been robbed of our fruit crop for two years in succes - sion by late frosts. However, the trees were not to blame, for they were loaded with bloom each year. While this failure may not occur in many years, yet we cannot help feeling our ardor cooled a little. But should we be called upon to pass through the same ordeal, I believe it would be well to try oil pots tor some other material that will create a good smudge, as straw or weeds mixed with stable manure to keep if from burning too rapidly, taking care not to injure the trees. I have been asked many times if I thought this part of the state would ever produce fruit to amount to anything. I have always answered in the affirmative, for good reasons. First, my orchard bore ten crops of fruit in sucession, all kinds of apples, making a good showing each year, except Red June which has not been a success. I have sixteen varieties in bearing. Crabs are a great success, I have two transcended trees which have paid me $45.00 in one year. While I have not had great success with cherries and plums yet some of my neighbors have had good success, and as far as I can learn they are a success throughout this district. I would not advise anyone in my district to plant many peaches, our winters are too changable. I would plant a few, if they do not bring any fruit, they are nice to look at and make a very nice shade, the Crosby is the hardiest. I have found, out of five varieties I have tried we would advise everyone to plant a few trees, each of standard and dwarf pears, they seem to be hardy and make a good growth, the Bartlett is a very good one, there may be others equally good. As far as I can learn grapes are not a success in southwestern Nebraska, they have proven a falure with me. However, I would say to every home builder in this newly settled part of our good state. Plant fruit try a little of all kinds, but let apples and cherries predominate. I am speaking particularly to those in our dis - trict where fruit is always dear and hard to get. You will not regret it </seg>
