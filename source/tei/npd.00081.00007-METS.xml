            <seg id="p003">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL To His Excellency, Roy L. Cochran, Governor of tie State of Nebraskai Lincoln, Nebn ska. Honored Sir.' In accordance with the laws of the State of Nebraska relating to powers and duties of the State Fire Marshal, I have the honor of pre - senting for your consideration the Twenty-Eighth Annual Report of the Department of Fire Prevention. This report covers the activities of the department from January 1, 1936, to Dec smber 31, 1936. Respectively submitted, faORACE M. DAVIS, j State Fire Marshal. February 15, 1B37. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">STATE OF NEBRASKA DEPARTMENTS FINANCIAL STATUS The sole income of the Department of Fire Prevention is derived from an assessment of three-etghU-s of one per cent of the gross premium income of stock fire insurance companies and foreign mutual companies doing business in Nebraska, and one-eighth of one per cent of like income of domestic mutuals and assessment companies. The law provides that the State shall not be liable for any of the expenses of the department. There was a marked decrease in income for the department from 1932 to 1934. In the last three years there has been a slight increase. The increase for 1936 over thai of 1935 was $51.36. The expense's of 1936 were $1,923.77 less than for the year 1935, with an increase in the activities of the department. By reference to the SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES, page 7, it will be noted that 8,948 buildings were inspected in 1936 as against 7,771 in 1935. There were 15,013 written orders issued and 7,965 of them com - plied with in 1936. In 1935 there were 14,167 written orders issued and 6,703 complionces reported to the office. There were 87 fires of suspicious origin investigated in 1936 compared to 79 investigated in 1935. A comparison of the financial; statement of 1936 with lhat of lf'35 shows the following facts: 1936 1935 Income $15,904.10 $15,852.74 Increase $ 51.35 Expenditures Salaries $ 9,642.00 810,594.65 Decrease $952.65 Office Expenses $ 990.14 $ 1,324.02 Decrease $333.88 Field Expenses $ 4,753.29 $ 4,960.55 Decrease $307.26 Fire Chiefs' Report Fees _. $ 788.00 $ 1,118.00 Decrease $330.00 Total Decrease in Expenditures :_ i $1,923.79 In 1935 the total expenditures exceeded the income by 82,144.48, and in 1936 the expenditures exceeded the income by only $260.33 There is a balance in the department's fund as of January 1, 1937, of $5,000.89 Comparative Receipts For Ten Years 1927 _._ $22,247.63 1932 $18,429.55 1928 22,009.61 1933 14,456.93 1929 22,330.48 1934 16,072,20 1930 22,295.13 1935 15.852.74 1931 — _ 21,024.31 1936 15,904.10 </seg>

            <seg id="p010">STATE OF NEBRASKA ARSON INVESTIGATIONS With 2,966 fires reported In the state by fire chiefs during 1936, only eighty seven of them were considered of questionable origin. This shows that incendiarism is abating, due to two principal reasons: That insurance companies are doing better underwriting and that as economic conditions improve the public morale is better. The law provides that fire chiefs and insurance companies shall immediately report to the State Fire Marshal all fires of questionable origin. Each of the 87 fires were investigated and in 39 counties. Only thirty fires could be seriously suspected of being motivated by criminal intent. In twenty-three cases over insurance might have induced the assureds to "cash in." Seven of the suspicious fires seemed to be perpetrated for malice or by irresponsible people. There is a tendency to attribute fires of unknown origin to elec - tric wiring or electric appliances. Of the 87 cases probed, the inves - tigators decided that nine were properly attributed to electric causes. Seventeen were accidental and four to spontaneous combustion. Twenty four fires were examined on farms, ten of houses and four - teen of barns and outbuildings. In cities and villages there were in - vestigated 29 residences, 15 mercantile places, 2 theatres, 2 automobiles and trucks, 5 manufacturing places, 5 beer taverns and dance halls, one school and 4 garages and lilling stations. Many other' fires were investigated where there was no suspicion of incendiarism but where the nature of the fire seemed to warrant study of the origin as a possible means of protection against future similar losses. This is particularly true of farm fires where there were reasons to believe that hay and fodder might be responsible. Some thought was given to local water supply and other possible first aid methods for saving rural property that did not have immediately available the assistance of firemen and motorized apparatus from the neighboring villages. There have been two penitentiary convictions during the year, and all from Omaha. For these the arson squad of the Omaha fire department and local officials are to be credited. Out-state, one boy was sent to a reformatory. A man who confessed to malicious burning was committed to an insane hospital. One accused left the state before arrested. One suspect is in jail pending hearing and two others are </seg>
            <seg id="p011">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION under bond for district court trails. One accused was held to district court but dismissed for lack of convincing evidence. At least five of last year's c ases are still pending further investigation. Two ancient fires, one as f I x back as 1912, have revived new interest and are being examined. With a fe'f notable exceptions, county attorneys and peace officers have been helpful in seeking facts about mysterious fires. Fire chiefs are universall f interested and assist conscientiously. Arson cas( s are hard to prove because physical evidence is apt to be destroyed; motives are hard to establish and evidence is usually circumstantial. It is wortl.y of note that vigorous investigations have a worthwhile influence in :i community, as deterents, even if no complaints are* filed. VALUED POLICY LAW Without questioning the good motives that prompted the enactment of a law that provides that the assured shall collect the face of his fire insurance poli :y in case of a total loss of a building, regardless of its value, the lavr, in practice, is a stimulant to criminality. A case in point: An accused purchased a tract of land for $1,000 in the spring of 1936, paying half cash and assuming a mortgage for the other half. There were ' wo small dwellings and some outbuildings. Between the assured and the agent, $2,750 fire indemnity was written on the buildings. A questionable fire totally destroyed one dwelling that was insured for si,500, but scarcely worth $300. The temptation was too strong. The valued policy statute was passed to cure the evil of over insurance. But it has not succeeded. It is questionable if any law is morally correct if it stimulates criminality. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">STATE OF NEBRASKA FIRE PREVENTION WEEK October 4 to 10, 1936 WASTE is never justified nor excusable. Fire conscious - ness and a proper respect for property can cure a carelessness that appoaches criminal negligence. fl The great Chicago fire of October 9, 1871, has fixed the date for a nation-wide observance of Fire Prevention Week. The President of the United States has issued a proclamation calling upon all citizens to give thoughtful attention to the menace of fire which takes thousands of lives and millions of dollars worth of property annually. £ During 1935 there were 5,048 fires reported in Nebraska, taking a toll of 79 lives — 183 personal injuries, and a property loss estimated at 32,104,899. For the first half of 1936, the loss of life and limb has exceeded the record for the same period of last year, and property losses, as reported by fire departments, will show an increase in fire waste of fifty per cent over the first half of 1935. This is especially true on the farms and in unprotected villages where the loss ratio is, approximately, sixty per cent of the value of the properties involved. U Fire prevention, thus, becomes a very immediate problem in our homes, in places of public assemblage ar.-d in business buildings. Fire departments, schools, churches, theateis, commercial and civic organ - izations can offer no greater assistance to their communities than to consider hazardous conditions and lead the way for enlightened bet - terment. U Now, therefore, I, R. L. Cochran, Governor of Nebraska, do hereby join with our President in calling attention to the week of October 4 to October 10, inclusive, 1936, as FIRE PREVENTION WEEK and invoke the official, professional and personal assistance of all Nebraskans in eliminating fire hazards, protecting human life and re - ducing property waste. In Witness Whereof, I have, hereunto, set my hand and caused the seal of the State of Nebraska ■ • to be affixed. (SEAL) Done at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 11th day of Sept - ember, in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and thirty-six. GOVERNOR </seg>
            <seg id="p013">DEPARTMENT OF FJRE PREVENTION OBSERVANCE OF FIRE PREVENTION WEEK. In harmon r with national nnd state proclamations, Fire Prevention Week was eff&lt; ctively observed from October 4 to 10, 1936. Volunteer and salaried fire departments held demonstrations and parades and a -ranged exhibits to command the public's attention to avoidable waste that takes an annual, national toll of ten thousand lives and more than three hundred millions of dollars. Sermons vere delivered in many churches on the opening dny, chambers of commerce and civic clubs built their programs around ' safety measures, women's clubs and parent-teachers groups took active interest. But i ctivilies centered about the public and parochial schools. Broadcasts g stations were generous in allowing time for addresses on fire prevention measures. City and rural newspapers printed edu - cational information and statistics. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction issued a circular that reached fill teachers and pupils with practical suggestions about avoiding fire hazards. One village fire department in the state visited each rural schc ol in its trade zone with a group of firemen and the fire truck to demoi strate how farm fires may»be averted and extinguished. Particular! ' effective work was accomplished by the North Platte department urder the leadership of Chief Payne, who died the week following, along with his driver, on the way to answer an alarm. This offio furnished literature on fire prevention to many in - quiring school; and departments. Others were supplied by writing to the National Tire Protection Association, Boston, Mass. A nominal charge is mate by the NFPA for pamphJets, suggested programs, posters and stickeis. Fire chiefs are urged to write to the Boston office for parti zulars. LESSONS FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS The set of lessons prepared by Mr. Criswell of the Ohio Inspection Bureau were c ontinued during 1936 to such departments as requested them. Letters from chiefs and secretaries indicate that they are being used to good advantage. They will be continued another year. . A total of 2,465 lessons were mailed out during the year. </seg>

During 1936, 35 people lost their lives and 123 others were badly injured from this cause. Five people lost their lives and ten others weie seriously burned when gasoline transport trucks - ran into the side of moving trains. As usual the innocent paid the price of carelessness. Three train men -died and another was badly burned in one such crash, while the driver of the truck escaped unscathed. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION KINDLING FIRES WITH KEROSENE In one n orhing's mail there came reports of four deaths, each resulting from explosions when kerosene was used to hurry up fires in cook stoves Will peop e never learn? It seems that folks are unwilling to learn from the experience of ethers. There is much talk about deaths from automobile accidents, but the woman or babe who burns suffers a more excruciating death. In an outs.anding case a strong man lost his life in attempting to save his family after an explosion from kindling the kitchen range with kerosene. A sample of the fluid was sent to the state chemist for analysis ai d it was shown that it contained at least ten percent of gasoline, thus naking it too volatile for safe domestic use. In the we item part of the state a babe of eighteen months was fatally burned the more pathetic because the father was serving a term in the st ite penitentiary. And bewai e of kerosene for chicken brooders. FIRE WORKS HAZARDS Perhaps h ilf of the municipalities in Nebraska have local ordi - nances govern ns the sale and use of fire works. In ■ harmony with the prevailing sentiment throughout the state, Ihe Fire Marshal's office has und irtaken to enforce a regulation that no fire works shall be offered for sale within 150 feet of a gasoline filling station. Regu - lation in cities amply provided with ordinances is left to local author - ities. There las been the finest degree of cooperation. A statewide statute on the subject would place enforcement within the scope of local and cour ty officials. BOTTLED GAS INSTALLATIONS Compresse 1 gas systems shnll never be installed with storage tanks inside of build nj-s, nor shall any bottled gas system be installed unless each piece of i pparatus bears the label of the Underwriters Laboratory. Iowa has had some bitter experience with bad apparatus and careless installations. L total loss just outside the village of Polk in Nebraska is attributed to bungling work in installing a container of compressed gas in the basement of a fine country home. Fire chiefs are author - ized to order ;he removal of unauthorized installations. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">STATE OF NEBRASKA RURAL FIRE LOSSES HIGH The number of fires reported by fire chiefs is 39 per cent higher than for 1935. This is probably due to two factors: During July and August the number of fires was very high and the losses large on ac - count of weather conditions; also that fire chiefs are reporting more of the rural fires and fire departments are answering more rural calls. In several counties, the local fire departments are cooperating with farmers in organizing for rural fire fighting. Booster tanks and trucks are purchased by local subscriptions. The fire-fighting equip - ment is housed in town and manned by local firemen. Of the 563 rural fires reported by fire chiefs, 394 of them show a complete loss of buildings, and there was a complete loss of contents in 264 of the fires. There was a complete loss in 70 per cent of the number of farm fires. There were 117 farm fires reported in the month of July with a loss of S169,271&gt;. In one mail in July, 18 reports of rural fires were received. Because of the lack of facilities for fighting rural fires, the lack of an adequate water supply, the insiccessability of the property because of distance and conditions of the roads, especially in winter, often the lack of telephone communications, there is&gt; a very high loss ratio. Some form of legislation authorizing expenditure of public funds for rural fire-fighting equipment seems desirable. In some states the township boards have power to levy funds for this purpose. In others, the county boards can make expenditures to buy equipment, Nebraska has no law authorizing such expenditures. RURAL ELECTRIFICATION Following recent Federal legislation, there is a marked Increase in the development of electric service on tre farir.s. The building of transmission lines is safeguarded by present statutes, but there is no law establishing a code of wiring for kuildin-is in rural communities. Farmers, electricians, public and private power companies and insur - ance companies have public and private interests to subserve. The De - partment of Fire Prevention is concerned for the protection of life and property, but has no legal authority to make inspections outside of municipal corporations. It is urged, however, that the power com - panies and the electricians, which aie professionally interested, follow the National Electrical Code in estimating, in wiring and in making connections to farm buildings. Human lives and uninsurable property are hazarded by unethical wiring practices. </seg>

            <seg id="p019">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION DATA ON RURAL FIRES COMPARED Beginnin { on page 28 are given two tables showing data on rural fires. The f rst table is from fire chiefs* reports. The second shows the losses p: id by insurance companies. Of necessity, the reports of losses paid a -e received later than the reports from fire chiefs, some - times as late i is two montjhs. In order to close the books on December 31, the losses re] orted paid after that date will be included in next year's reports. The table showed the results of the reports from insurance com - panies for al out ten and a half months. It is a y roblem to get reports of all farm fires. Fire depart - ments are net always called. "Most of the chiefs have given splendid cooperation i nd have gone to some pains to secure the data. It will be noted that there are no reports of rural fires in seventeen counties, in the more sp nicely settled sections where there are few local fire departments. There ar : five counties in which no fire losses were reported paid by insurance companies. Insurance companies have generally given very satisfac ory reports. By comp iring the losses reported by fire chiefs with the losses paid by insu -ance companies — considering the losses paid are for ten and a half months — it will be noted that the losses paid equals 76 per cent of the lo ;ses reported by chiefs. According to reports of the chiefs, 57 per cent if the value of the property was insured, and there was a loss of 62 p :r cent of the value of the property. Nebraska Fire Prevention Association The Neb aska Fire Prevention Association, with headquarters at Omaha, held several city inspections during the year with especially good two-days meetings at Kearney and Hastings. Public and com - mercial buil&lt; ings were inspected, public addresses made and com - munities awi kened to fire-consciousness. President S. L. Gardner e.nd Secretary R, R. Hayes of Omaha head the assc ciation, which is largely made up of field men who rep - resent stock : ire insurance companies in Nebraska. ■'■.'■ .'■■!.

            <seg id="p020">STATE OF NEBRASKA REPORTING, INVESTIGATING FIRES Nebraska Statutes, 1925. 81—5506, Fife Chiefs Duties: (a) The Chief of the fire department of every city or village in which a fire department is established, the mayor of every incorporated city in which no fire department exists, the town clerk of every organized town - ship or the county commissioner in every commissioner district in counties not under township organization without the limits of any organized city or village shall investigate or cause to be investigated the cause, origin and circumstances of every fire occurring in such city, village, township or commissioner district by which property has been destroyed or damaged when the damage exceeds fifty dollars; that all fires of unknown origin shall be reported, and such officers shall especially make investigation and report as to whether such fire was the result of carelessness, accident or design. (b) Such investigation shall be begun within two days of the oc - currence of such fire, and the state fire marshal shall have the right to supervise and direct such investigation whenever he deems it ex - pedient or necessary. (c) The officer making investigation of fires occurring in . cities, villages, townships or commissioner districts shall forthwith notify said state fire marshal and shall with - in one week of the occurrence of the fire, furnish to the said fire marshal a written statement of all the facts relating to the cause and origin of the fire, and such further information as may be called for by the state fire marshal. The state fire marshal shall keep in his office a record by alphabeti - cal index, name of town, and by county and precinct in all unincorporated territory, of all the .-fires occurring in the state, together with all facts, statistics and circumstances includng the cause and origin of the firea, which may be determined by the investigation provided by this act; such reports and statistics shall be at all times open to public inspection. I (1925 page 480) Nebraska Statutes, 1925. 81 — 5521. Penalties for Failure: Any of - ficer referred to in the fifteenth preceding section (81—5506), who neglects to comply with any of the requirements of this act shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars for each neglect or vio-» lation. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION Fire Departments Organized There is an increasing activity among villages to install water systems and or ;;mize fire departments. Many requests for information about organizing fire departments were received. Re-organization and bringing equipment up to date indicate increased interest in fire fighting. Personal assistance has been given in organizing fire de - partments as requested. The office is at all times ready to answer such calls. Firemen's Convention The Nebraska State Volunteer Firemen's Association held its annual meeting at Columbus on October 20, 21, 22, 1936. The next annual meeting will be held at North Platte in October, 1937. The following officers were sleeted at the Columbus meeting: Faye ] 1. Wood, Seward President Carl ' Verner, Battle Creek First Vice President O. P. burrows, Mitchell Second Vice President Louis A. Novak, Norfolk Secretary-Treasurer \ Walte • C. Rundin, Wahoo Chaplain Comparative Losses in Town and Country A survey of the reports from fire chiefs shows that 78 per cent of the value &gt;f the property involved in fires in cities and villages was covered b y insurance and the loss was 4.3 per cent of the value of the property. This is a contrast to the results from rural fires. The reports show that 57 per cent of the property was covered by in - surance and the loss was 62 per cent of the value of the property involved. Venting Gasoline Storage Tanks Just as r: pidly as it can be done, filling stations must raise the vent pipes to their storage tanks to eight or more feet in height. The tops shall open into free air currents. Gasoline fumes are two and a half tines as heavy as air, hence cling to the ground and are easily explode d by backfiring motor cars. A new federal law sets out details fcr installing vent pipes. State inspectors may padlock stations refus ng to comply. </seg>

            <seg id="p043">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION PLEASE, AND THANKS The statute that provides for the establishment of the Fire Mar - shal's office requires that it shall maintain a statistical department for the aecumulatior and compilation of fire insurance facts and that they shall be available to the public and shall be published. This 1!)3(&gt; report represents a conscientious effort to. comply with the statutory re [Uirement. The information herein is gathered from the reports of fire chiefs, the reports from fire insurance companies, from newspaper;, from state and county officials and from the field findings of the traveling deputies. It costs money. Is it worth it? The men who have furnished the data c-mpiled and published should be interested in the state-wide facts. The pamphlet is not-worth the cost unless t is read. T&lt;&gt; that end we trust that each fire chief will in&gt; over thf panes thoughtfully, that he will take his copy to the next meeting of the fire department and discuss with the Volunteers the relationship of their local expeiience with the experience of Nebraska as a v hole. Comparisons are very much worth while. There are &lt; rrors and omissions. Suggestions for betterment are welcomed. We are all trying to save life and property from fire hazards. That means to reduce hazards to a minimum. The known experiences of '. 936 should point to improved preventive measures for 1937. Firemen arc most inteiestec) and through the firemen the public may be interested. Our sincere &gt;t appreciations are expressed to firemen, to insurance executives, to S( hools, newspapers and civic leaders for their assistance. Horace M. Davis, State Fire Marshal </seg>
