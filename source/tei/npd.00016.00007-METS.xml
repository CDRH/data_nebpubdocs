            <seg id="p004">fear Sir. — In harmony with the legal and customary require - ts I have the honor to submit herewith this, the Ninth Bien- Report of this Institution, The State Hospital for Insane, for biennial period ending November 30th, 1906. ILt the beginning of this biennial period, Dec. 1st, 1904, there •e nine hundred eighty-seven (987) patients in the Institution, whom six hundred sixty-seven (667) were males and three ldred twenty (320) were females. During the biennium. hundred ninety-eight (198) have been admitted, of whom one ldred sixty-three (163) were males and thirty-five (35) were lales. Of these six (6) were discharged as recovered, seven - a (17) improved, two (2) unimproved, thirty- three (33) par- I and one hundred seventy-one (171) died. During this per - . two (2) patients have been transferred to the Lincoln dum. During the period covered by this report the general health of the inmates has been exceptionally good. The modern san - itary and other appliances tending toward the health and com - fort of the patients have been improved in many ways, and the Institution is nearer accomplishing that for which it was estab - lished, than ever before. Khe per capita cost for the biennial period was two hundred lty-seven dollars and fifty cents ($287.50), or an average y per capita of thirty-nine and three-eighths cents (39%c). OCCUPATION. I y he great value of suitable occupation and employment for se who have passed the first stage of mental disease is well ognized, and a strong effort has been made in this hospital provide such employment for those willing to be employed, large number of patients have been regularly employed on farm and in the gardens, dairy, laundry, sewing room, and er industrial departments. For the past few years we have n able to manufacture practically all the mattresses used in Hospital. The sewing room has not only supplied all the :hing for the female department of the Institution, but for the </seg>

IMPROVEMENTS. &gt;&gt;uring the biennial period just closed many substantial im - »vements have been made, the most important of these are follows : A new amusement hall building, on the first floor of which is located a general store room, drug room and sewing room. is a handsome building and furnishes the Institution with an e'egant auditorium sixty by one hundred feet, an improve - i-ient very much needed. A new farm cottage has been located one-half mile southwest of the Hospital which accommodates twen - ty-fi male patients, most of these being employed in the dairy department. From a special appropriation made by the last legislature, two trreenhouses (each 24x120 ft.) have been built, and two marine boil' h two hundred fifty (250) horse power, have been installed ; also one additional dynamo. 100 K. W. added lo our lighting plant : and two additional Kirker-Bender fire es - s installed. The entire exterior of the main building has recently been re-painted, and has not only materially benefited the buildings, t'Ut has greatly improved the general appearance of the Institu- The sewer has been extended about twenty-one hundred 0) feet, and at this time empties at a point more than three f.uarters of a mile from the Institution. The lawn has been vast - ly increased in size during the biennium, and a large number of additional shade, fruit, and ornamental trees added. Forty thousand (40,000) square feet of manufactured stone walks have been laid and is one of the very noticeable and substantial improvements. Our gardens this year represented approximately one hundred thirty (130) acres and the yield was very abun- ENTERTAINMENTS More than the usual amount of amusement and entertainment has been provided during the biennium, and especially so since the opening of our new amusement hall; usually one or two dances and one musical recital each week, in addition to fre - quent chapel services. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">91 NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTION. I he Institution is very much in need of another building for care of female patients, and in addition to this, a good modern ition cottage with a capacity of from seventy to one hun - 1 beds, for the care of tubercular and other contagious and ctious diseases. Additional coal bins, or room for storing , is greatly needed and for the purpose of erecting such a ding, an appropriation of five thousand dollars ($5,000) is I 'he offices in the Administration Building being quite inade - ,te for an Institution of this size, it is certainly advisable to vide additional room in this department, hence it is recom - lded that a suitable cottage be erected to be used as a ce by the superintendent and his family and the rooms at sent used for this purpose be converted into offices. The nber of night watches, night nurses and other night emp; of necessity increased in number until it is very necessary to vide desirable apartments for them and a detached building of ;able size to be used as a night watch cottage is also recom - lded and very much needed. CONCLUSION. Ia conclusion I wish to express my earnest appreciation of the ilty and fidelity of our esteemed steward, Mr. H. C. Haverly, &gt;se valuable assistance is most highly appreciated. Also to ;nd my sincere thanks to those constituting the assistant phy - ans on our medical staff, who have so faithfully and intelli - tly performed their respective duties ; and to the various heads he departments and other employes who have lent much val - le assistance in the success of the Institution. To Your Excellency, the Governor, and the Board of Public I. amis and Buidings, I desire to assure you of my appreciation of your kindly and loyal assistance and your constant and valu - able advice. Respectfully, W. B. KERX, M. D., Superintendent. </seg>
