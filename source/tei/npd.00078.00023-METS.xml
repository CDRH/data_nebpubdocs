            <seg id="p005">The Identification of the More Important Prairie Hay Grasses of Nebraska by Their Vegetative Characters = F. D. KEIM, G. W. BEADLE 3 AND A. L. FROLIK It is convenient and sometimes necessary to identify the grasses m their vegetative stage of growth. This is espe - cially desirable m a study of the vegetation of native hay I meadows and permanent pastures. This key is prepared as a guide m the identification of the more important prairie hay grasses of Nebraska. The meadows are often harvested be - fore the floral parts of many of the grasses appear. If it t is desired, therefore, to study the botanical composition of i the native meadows, it becomes necessary to rely on identi - i fication of many of the grasses by means of vegetative char - acters. c THE GRAMINEAE (GRASS) FAMILY i The grasses, members of the Gramineae family, form a ] distinct group of plants as differentiated from other families S of flowering plants. They are readily distinguished from other I families of plants by their floral parts. Fortunately, they vary sufficiently m their vegetative structures so that most grasses may be identified by their vegetative characters alone.

Nodes Distinct Indistinct 1 Refers to number of rows of leavcj on the stem. The families of plants most likely to be confused with the grasses are members of the Cyperaceae (sedge) and Junca - ■ ceae (rush) . Several definite differences, however, exist be - tween these two groups of plants and the grasses. These are I summarized m Tables 1 and 2.

Nodes Distinct Indistinct USEFUL EQUIPMENT Certain tools are of considerable value m identifying grasses vegetatively. A trowel or tile spade is useful m un - covering the desired underground parts. A scalpel or sharp knife is essential m obtaining a cross section of the bud shoot. A ruler including the metric system (measurements m milli - meters) is of decided value m obtaining the size of the plant parts. Then the most valuable of all is the magnifying glass or hand lens, which is almost essential m identifying and carefully describing plant parts. VEGETATIVE CHARACTERS USED IN IDENTIFICATION UNDERGROUND REPRODUCTIVE PARTS The roots of all grasses are of the fibrous type, but vary considerably with respect to size, abundance, length, and ex - tent of branching. Because of the inconvenience m study - ing them and their comparatively minor value m work of this nature, the roots are disregarded as a distinguishing char - acter. The more important vegetative reproductive organs of the grasses are the stolons, rhizomes, and conns. Stolons are above-ground creeping stems, often rooting at the nodes and producing new plants. Rhizomes, commonly called root - stocks, are modified underground stems capable of producing new plants from the nodes. These stems are usually hori - zontal and coarser than the roots. The presence of rudi - mentary leaves, buds, nodes, and internodes definitely iden - tifies the rhizomes as stems. A conn is a bulb-shaped swell - ing at the base of the culm. None of the grasses included m the study reproduces by stolons. A number reproduce by rhizomes. Only one species </seg>

In other grasses, the rhizomes are prominent and i extensive, and the grass is a typical sod-former. Stipa '■ comata (needle grass) and Spartina michauxiana (slough : grass) respectively, are examples of these types (Fig. 1). j The presence or absence of rhizomes and their relative size ] and length are used as distinguishing characters. THE BUD SHOOT v The arrangement of the individual leaves m the bud, 3 termed " vernation," may be a useful character. Leaves m I the bud are classified as folded (conduplicate) or rolled (con - \ volute) (Fig. 2). In species with folded leaves, the blade lis folded at the midvein, the edges not overlapping. Rolled li leaves are distinctly rolled into a spiral form. c .

            <seg id="p008">Nebr. ExpK Sta. Research Bulletin 65 8 petiole, forms the tubelike structure enveloping the stem. The blade is the linear, more or less flattened structure at - tached to the sheath. The transition tissue or "joint" be - tween the blade and the sheath is known as the collar. In many grasses clawlike appendages project from the collar or the base of the blade. These are known as auricles. The mem - branous or hairy structure usually present at the base of the blade on the inner side of the leaf is known as the ligule. Sheath. — The sheath usually forms a tube-like structure around the stem. It may be entire, or the edges may merely overlap. When observed m cross section, the sheaths may be classified as round or compressed. The shape is dependent upon the shape of the bud shoot and culm. The sheath may be colored, particularly that portion below the surface of the ground. The pigment may be generally distributed through the sheath tissue or may be confined to the veins. The sheath is either glabrous or pubescent, and the latter vary consider - ably m pubescence. The veins of the sheath are distinct m certain grasses and inconspicuous m others. Ligule. — The ligule is one of the most useful characters m identifying grasses m the vegetative stage. It may be membranous, it may be a fringe of hairs, or it may be absent (Fig. 3). The membranous types of ligules are classified as truncate, obtuse, or acute (Fig. 4). The margin of each of CfU LjZJ LhJ ' Fig. 3. — Ligule types. — A. I■■ /VJL / V / \^~,J Membranous. B.

Auricles. — Auricles are present only m certain species of grasses, and they vary materially m size and shape. They are rounded, straight, clawed, reduced, or absent (Fig. 6). They may be either pubescent or glabrous. Blade. — Leaf blades are classified as bristle-like or flat, with respect to form. The former never assumes a flattened shape. Bristle-like leaves are classified as solid, folded, or U-shaped. Flat leaves are classified as distinctly flat, V-shaped, folded, U-shaped, edges rolled m, or rolled (Fig. 7). It must be considered m a classification of this type that many leaves may change from their normal shape to a more rolled condition when the plants are subjected to a low soil mois- j2 p. si |v tur e or to a hot, dry atmosphere.

            <seg id="p011">Identification of Prairie Hay Grasses 11 ASSOCIATED VEGETATION Species of a similar water requirement are often found growing together. Finding certain more easily identified species indicates a probability that other species requiring a similar habitat also occur there. If Andropogon furcatus (big bluestem) is found growing under favorable conditions m a plant community, then the possibilities of finding Sofghas - trum nutans (Indian grass) and Panicum virgatum (switch - grass) m the same community are greatly enhanced. BASIS FOR SELECTING SPECIES INCLUDED IN THE KEY Only species that contribute to an appreciable extent to the prairie-hay crop of Nebraska have been included. Including species of very minor importance would make this key de - cidedly more cumbersome. Calamagrostis canadensis (blue - joint) and Paspalum stramineum (bead grass), although of minor importance m the state, have been included because of their importance m near-by prominent prairie-hay producing sections. All species listed m the government standards 4 for grades of prairie hay have been included except Fluminea, fes - tucacea (prickly fescue) which is of little importance m the state.
