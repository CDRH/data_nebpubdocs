            <seg id="p002">2 THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA. SECRETARY'S OFFICE To the Board of Regents — Gentlemen: El accordance with the statutes of the state and the customs of this I submit herewith a detailed statement of all receipts and appro - ons and all disbursements of money for the support of the University for the blennium from November 30, 1902, to and including November 30, 1904. All of the items in the accompanying statement have been examined and checked with the books of account and the vouchers on file, by your finance committee and the professional expert accountant employed by it, from time to time during the biennium just closed. Publication of these detailed financial statements is requested as a part of the biennial report of The Board of Regents to the Governor. That report being now published, for greater convenience, in two parts, I have prepared summaries of all the receipts and expenditures detailed in the second part, which summaries I request be published with the first part of the biennial report The general summaries give information which is often desired on the moment and it is hoped that they will be an aid to simplifying the mass of details contained in the second part. The sum - maries prepared for part one show the total amount appropriated for the University in 1903, the purposes for which appropriations were made, the total amounts expended for the two years ended November 30, 1904, the total of cash received and disbursed for the same period and the balances unexpended of all appropriations and funds on November SO, 1904. Respectfully submitted, J. S. DALES, Lincoln, Nebr., Dec. 5, 1904. Secretary. </seg>
