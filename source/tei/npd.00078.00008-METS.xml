            <seg id="p003">summary Co-operative investigations in dry-land crop production have been conducted on table land at the North Platte, Nebraska, Experimental Substation for the 26-year period from 1906 to 1931. This bulletin reports results from two experimental fields, the first covering a 25-year period from 1907 to 1931, and the second covering the 20-year period from 1912 to 1931 in one section and in another the 11-year period from 1921 to 1931. The table-land soil of the Substation is a deep, fairly uniform, very fine sandy loam, fertile and easily tilled. Wide fluctuations in all weather elements are important factors in crop production. On the Substation table, the frost-free season has ranged from 121 to 171 days and averaged 151. The annual precipita - tion has ranged from 11.18 to 34.85 inches and averaged 19.15. Sea - sonal evaporation has ranged from 34.21 to 51.47 inches and averaged 41.31. The seasonal ratios of evaporation to precipitation have ranged from 1.23:1 to 6.06:1. The ratio of the mean evaporation to the mean precipitation is 2.77:1. Seasonal wind velocities two feet above the ground have ranged from 6.1 to 9 miles per hour and averaged 7.7J Average annual acre yields from all methods of tillage ranged from practical failures to 47.2 bushels for corn, 42.7 bushels for winter wheat, 26.6 bushels for spring wheat, 64.3 bushels for oats, 39.5 bushels for barley, 28.5 bushels for rye, 48.5 bushels for milo, 255.4 for potatoes, 5.6 tons for sorghum, 1.9 tons for alfalfa, and 0.9 ton for brome grass. Average bushel-per-acre yields for the 20-year period from 1912 to 1931 were: corn, 22.1; winter wheat, 20.3; spring wheat, 13.7; oats, 31.6; barley, 22.3; and potatoes, 101.6. Winter wheat continuously cropped or following other small grain on different methods of seed-bed preparation produced average bushel-per - acre yields as follows: late plowing, 14.7; early disking and late plow - ing, 16.7; disking only, 16.9; early plowing top-dressed with manure, 17.3; and early plowing followed by clean tillage, 20.4. The benefits of early tillage are largely the result of moisture saved by weed control. Winter wheat after corn produced an average yield of 16.1 bushels per acre when seeded without disking, and 20.4 bushels when the corn was removed and the land disked before the wheat was seeded. ! The average winter-wheat yield after potatoes was 21.6 bushels per acre. Winter wheat produced an average yield of 30.1 bushels per acre after clean fallow and 22.2 after weedy fallow. The average yield on clean fallow was 0.7 bushel per acre more than twice the yield of that on late plowing after small grain and 10.7 bushels less than twice the yield of that on early plowing. In comparing winter wheat after fallow with winter wheat after corn, each bushel of wheat gained by the former was offset by 2.4 bushels of corn gained by the latter method. Winter wheat after rye for green manure has produced only slightly more and after peas for green manure slightly less than after fallow, thus indicating that any advantage in fertility that may have resulted from the use of preen manures was offset by moisture conditions less satisfactory than after fallow. Abandonment of winter wheat on account of winterkilling amounted to 13.3 per cent of the area seeded. The greatest loss was 16.9 per; cent on late plowing after small grain, and the smallest loss was 7.5 per cent after fallow. </seg>

            <seg id="p005">Dry Land Crop Production L. L. ZOOK 1 The North Platte Experimental Substation is located three miles south of the city of North Platte in Lincoln county, Ne - braska. The dry-land studies of cropping systems, tillage methods, climatic effects, and soil-moisture relationships have been carried on in experimental fields on table land a short distance from the south side of the Platte valley. The alti - tude there is approximately 3,000 feet. These investigations were begun in the year 1906 and have continued since. This bulletin reports the principal results in crop production from two fields. In the one field the period of 25 years from 1907 to 1931 is covered and for the other the period of i20 years from 1912 to 1931. Another section of the second field covers the 11 years from 1921 to 1931. The first field, No. 41, was broken from the native sod in 1887. It was planted continuously with corn for 17 years and then used for oats and barley in 1904 and 1905. Includ - ing the year 1906, during which the treatments for ihe cropping systems were being developed, the land was in cul - tivation for 20 years previous to the beginning of the experi - mental period. The second field, No. 49, was broken from sod about 1895 and planted to forest trees. The trees were cultivated for only a short time, and when the land was acquired for the Substation in 1904, most of the trees had died and the liind had gone back to sod. The tree stumps were removed and the land broken in 1905. From 1906 to 1909 the land was used for general farm - ing, and in 1910 it was laid out in experimental plats. The years 1910 and 1911 were used for preliminary work, so that the experimental records from this field begin with 1912. SOIL The soil of the experimental fields is designated by the U. S. Bureau of Chemistry and Soils as "Holdrege very fine sandy loam." It is fertile and with favorable weather pro - duces good yields. A high percentage of very fine sand makes tillage easy and permits moisture to penetrate readily. ■Agronomist, North Platte Experimental Substation, and Associate Agronomist, Divi - sion of Dry Land Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture.

            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 279 The moisture equivalent or field-carrying capacity of the first foot ranges from 18 to 20 per cent of the dry weight. This increases slightly through a somewhat heavier layer of subsoil of varying thickness at depths of 3 to 6 feet below the surface and decreases to 18 per cent or less at depths below the heavier layer. The hygroscopic coefficients range from about 7.6 per cent for the surface soil to 9 per cent in the heavier subsoil layer. The average weight per cubic foot for the upper six feet is about 85 pounds. The amount of water it is possible to store for the use of crops averages slightly less than 1Y_ inches per foot, or about 8 inches for the upper six feet of soil. climate Climatological records for the vicinity of North Platte are available from three sources. The United States Weather Bureau has maintained a station in the city of North Platte since 1874. Records of temperature, precipitation, evapora - tion, humidity, and wind movement are kept from April 1 to September 30 each year at a station near the experimental plats on the table. At a second station on the bench near the buildings, temperature and wind-movement records are kept throughout the year, and precipitation, evaporation, and humidity records are kept for the season from April 1 to September 30. ■n7 A^ he Substation temperatures are recorded in a standard Weather Bureau shelter, and precipitation is measured by a standard Weather Bureau gauge. Evaporation is measured by daily micrometer readings of changes of water level in a tank 24 inches deep and 6 feet in diameter, sunk to a depth of about 20 inches in the ground. Wind movement is deter - mined by daily readings of a standard four-cup anemometer exposed at a height of twafeet.

The difference j be - tween the coldest and warmest January on record at North Platte is 27 degrees, but the July high and low means differ by only 12 degrees. The absolute temperatures for January differ by 105 degrees and those for July by 66. On the Substation table, maximum temperatures of 100° or more were recorded in 15 of the 25 years, and on a total of 72 days. The highest number of days of such record in any one year was 12. Near the Substation buildings, no winter in the 25-year period has passed without the record - ing of zero or lower temperatures. The total number of such records in 25 years is 415, and the number per year has varied from 3 to 32. The growing season at the Substation, as determined by the last date in spring and the first in the fall when 32° or lower temperature was recorded, is shown in Figure 1. j The spring dates ranged from April 19 to May 28 and the average was May 7. The fall dates ranged from September 17 to October .20, and the average was October 5. The shortest season between freezing temperatures was 121 days, the longest 171 days and the average 151 days. | Al - though five of the shortest seasons began later and ended earlier than the average dates and five of the longest seasons began earlier and ended later than the average dates, there was no consistent tendency for either early or late spring frost to be followed by corresponding or opposite departures </seg>

Precipitation. — Precipitation records for a period of 25 years are shown in Table 2. The mean annual precipitation for the 25 years was 19.15 inches. This is 0.76 inch in excess of the Weather Bureau normal. Monthly means for the 25-year period and the Weather Bureau monthly means cor - respond rather closely. The greatest departure for any month was 0.22 inch for May. In normal rainfall distribution January is the low month with 0.39 inch. Subsequent months show increases to June, with 3.22 inches, followed by a decline to November with 0.47 inch and December with 0.53 inch. Normal precipitation for the six months from April to September is 14.54 inches, or 79 per cent of the total. </seg>

The frequent wide departures from normal in amount and distribution are vital factors in determining yields. Year-by-year departures from normal precipitation are shown graphically in Figure 2. The chart is subdivided by vertical lines into five 5-year per - iods. There was no tendency during the 25-year period for departures to occur in any systematic order or sequence. The longest period with departures in one direction was the five years of deficient rainfall from 1910 to 1914.

In the 24 seasons, daily velocities of less than 1 mile per hour were recorded only 10 times. The constancy and the frequently high velocity of the wind make it an important limiting factor in crop production. Velocities of about 15 miles per hour extending over several hours are capable of carrying large volumes of soil. On smooth, dry surfaces, after soil blowing has been started it will be continued by much lighter winds. Spring-seeded grain crops seldom escape some injury from wind and soil blow - ing. In dry seasons the damage is frequently severe and sometimes causes total loss. Fall-seeded grains which have not made a good fall cover are frequently injured and some - times destroyed by soil blowing during the winter and spring. Corn is sometimes injured early in the season by soil drifting into listed furrows, and more often by hot winds in the later summer. Mature or nearly mature crops are frequently </seg>

These are separated on the sides by cultivated alleys 3.5 feet wide and on the ends by roadways 16.5 feet wide in Field 41 and 20 feet wide in Field 49. For the first five or six years, drilled crops were seeded beyond the plat lines and the margins trimmed off before harvest time. Since that time, plats have been seeded with two rounds of an 8-foot, 12-hole drill. The ends are trimmed with a shovel or disk cultivator, but no trimming is done on the sides. In some years the growth is considerably better in the margins than in the interior of the plat. This marginal effect, however, seldom extends beyond the second drill row. Allowing an increase of 100 per cent for outside drill rows, 50 per cent for second drill rows, and a proportional amount for plat ends, the total increase would be equal to the yield ofs.3.75 drill rows. This is an area of 330 square feet, or 7.6 per cent of the plat area. The 48 drills seeded by two rounds of the 12-hole drill occupy only 32 feet and leave an unseeded strip averaging 6 inches wide on either side of the plat. This is a 3.1 per cent reduction in plat area. This reduction and the losses due to running over the grain in cutting the first round with the binder are thought to be sufficient to offset the increases due to marginal effects. On this account no corrections have been attempted for any of these factors. For corn the ill effects of exposure appear to outweigh the benefits of moisture from the alleys and outside rows seldom show any yield increases over those in the interior of the plats. The cropping systems consist of seven 2-year, thirty-four 3-year, fourteen 4-year, one 5-year, and two 6-year rotations, 15 plats upon which some one crop is grown continuously, and 14 plats used for alternate cropping and fallowing. These involve 218 plats. The numbers of plats for various crops at present are: corn and oats, each 46; winter wheat, 30; spring wheat, 23 ; barley, 17 ; rye, 19 ; potatoes, 6 ; field peas, milo, and sorghum, 5 each; and alfalfa and brome grass, 3 each. Rye and peas on 5 plats each were used for green man - ures each year. Barnyard manure was applied each year on successive single plats of each of four 3-year rotations, and on one plat continuously cropped with winter wheat. </seg>

With corn as 100, the average hull-free yields of the other crops were in the following ratios: winter wheat, 98; barley, 74; spring wheat, 66; and oats, 57.

            <seg id="p017">Dry Land Crop Production Milo for the 11-year period produced an average acre yield of 27.0 bushels, or 1,566 pounds. Corn for the same years averaged 24.9 bushels or 1,399 pounds. The grain yield of milo was 112 per cent of the corn yield. This yield increase of milo over corn is not sufficient to make up for its lower feeding value, difficulty of securing stands, higher cultiva - tion costs on account of its slow early growth, and greater harvesting costs. Sorghum seeded in close drills produced an average acre yield of 6,911 pounds or 3.46 tons of field-cured forage, On account of their ability to survive through rather severe periods of drouth, and to resume growth when moisture be^ comes available, sorghums are the most reliable annual forage crops for dry-land conditions. Yields under one ton per acre were produced in only two of the 24 years of record. The yields of alfalfa and brome grass are the averages of second and third years after seeding. First-year crops! were of sufficient value to justify cutting only twice in the 25 years. The low average yields are largely due to frequent failures to secure stands. It is noteworthy that these failures I were much more frequent in the earlier years. During the first 13 years alfalfa failed 9 and brome grass 10 times. During the last 12 years each crop failed only once. While this is due to some extent to a larger proportion of more favorable sea - sons during the later period, changes in preparing the land for seeding also have been important factors. The changes which contributed most to this result were : early fall plowing, followed by clean tillage to conserve moisture and germinate' weed seed; thorough packing; and early spring seeding, so that the plants become well started before hot, dry weather. In recent years, alfalfa and brome grass have been seeded at the same time or shortly after the seeding of spring grain. The wide fluctuations from year to year in the yields of all crops are due largely to variations in climatic relation - ships. There is a strong tendency for all crops to depart from normal in the same direction. This is particularly true of crops of similar growing season such as the spring grains. Among the spring grains there were only two instances in the 25 years of the yield of one crop going below or average when the departures of the other crops were in the opposite direction. In 1909 spring wheat yielded abovel aver - age while oats and barley were below average. In 1931 barley was below with oats and spring wheat above. While the yield variations of these three grains were usually in the same direction, the amount of variation frequently was' quite different. Oats are usually injured more than barley by hot ■ ■ ' - ■ ■ .7 . ' ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ . ■ ■■ ' ■'.'. .■:■'■ </seg>
            <seg id="p018">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 279 weather as the crop is nearing maturity. Oats, on the other hand, have a greater capacity than barley to respond to very favorable conditions, and in cool seasons of plentiful mois - ture have outyielded barley by substantial amounts. Seasons with conditions favorable to barley were more frequent than those with conditions favorable to oats. On the basis of these results, barley appears to be the surest and most pro - ductive spring grain for this section. A greater number of departures in opposite directions may be expected between crops of different seasonal growth habits. There is less similarity in the departure from normal of corn or milo and the small grains than between small grains. In the 25-year period, average yields of corn and barley were above average in the same year 9 times, below average in the same year 10 times, and departed from average in opposite directions 6 times. In pounds per acre barley outyielded corn 14 times and corn outyielded barley 11 times. These results indicate that production would be considerably stabil - ized by including both corn and barley in a cropping system. In the 20-year period, corn and winter wheat yields were above average in the same years 6 times, below average in the same years 7 times, and in opposite directions from aver - age 7 times. Winter wheat outyielded corn 11 times, and corn outyielded winter wheat 9 times. The 20-year average yield of corn is 1.8 bushels more than that of winter wheat but on account of the heavier bushel weight of winter wheat, its average yield is 20 pounds per acre above that of corn. These relationships indicate the value of including both crops in a cropping system. The effects of these crops upon one another when grown in rotation rather than continuously on the same land will be discussed later. Winter wheat outyielded spring wheat 17 times in 20 years The three cases of higher yields from spring wheat were in years when there was a total loss or heavy winter injury to winter wheat. The average yield of spring wheat is 67 per cent of the winter wheat average. These results leave little doubt as to the superior adaptation of winter wheat to this part of Nebraska. Spring wheat has little value in the cropping system, except occasionally to thicken stands of winter wheat partially killed by winter conditions. Comparative yields of corn and spring wheat furnish a good example of the necessity of long-time records in determin - ing crop adaptation. For the first and second 5-year periods the average yields of these two crops were almost the same. Spring wheat made the higher yield 7 times in the 10 years. During the third and fourth 5-year periods, corn yields aver - aged more than twice the spring-wheat yields, and the corn </seg>

The yields are in some cases from single plats. In other cases different numbers of plate are averaged. Where two figures are used in a column heading to designate the number of plats, the first figure is the num - ber of plats from 1912 to 1920 and the second figure! is the number from 1921 to 1931.

            <seg id="p020">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 279 ing, the weed growth on these plats is less than that on the plats left for late plowing. The early fall-plowed plat that is top-dressed with manure is adjacent to one of the other early - plowed plats, not top-dressed.

In fact, stands occasionally have been reduced by smothering caused by drifting soil lodging in the manure. The depressed yield of the manured plat is chiefly the result of the stimulating effect accruing from the annual application of manurel The rapid early growth often gave the crop a fine appekrance early in the season but frequently exhausted the moisture supply before the heads were completely developed. The average straw yields of the manured and unmanured treat - ments were 2,752 and 2,223 pounds per acre, respectively, an increase of 529 pounds or 23 per cent for the manurejd plat. The grain yield was, however, 3.1 bushels or 15 per cent less with manure than without manure. Relation of tillage of small grain stubble to weed control. — The benefits to be expected from early tillage after harvest are closely related to rainfall and weed control. Under nor - mal conditions, practically no available water is left j in up - land soils of this section after a grain crop has matured. There is no advantage in cultivating such soils as long as they remain dry. As soon as rains occur, however, weeds that previously may have been inconspicuous, will resume growth. If undisturbed, the growth of weeds and volunteer grain is usually sufficient to use most of the rainfall which occurs in the interval between harvest and seeding time for winter grains. At this station the amount of precipitation which occurred between July 11 and September 30, in the 25 years of record, ranged from 2.12 to 8.94 inches and averaged 5.71 inches. On account of high temperatures, the moisture losses from evaporation are high. However, if only 25 per cent of the rainfall had been saved, which is the average propor - tion stored by clean fallow, the average amount addedi to the soil in the after-harvest interval of the seasons enumerated would have been 1.43 inches. This amount, in addition to that received during the crop season, may be of greajt value in establishing stands and increasing yields. During seasons of above-normal rainfall, much larger amounts haVe been stored on early plowing. The tillage of grain-stubble land, in addition to being an important factor in storage of moisture after harvest, is also directly related to the progress of weed infestation. If not allowed to seed during this period, weeds of the kinds having seeds without easy means of distribution will soon disappear. Some of the weeds of this class are redroots (Amaranthus retroflexus) , foxtails (Setaria viridis and glauca), water grass (Echinocloa crus galli), and wild buckwheat (Poly - gonum convolvulus) . Weeds having burr-type seed pods such </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 279 as sandburs (Cenchus tribuloides) , cockleburs (Xanthium canadense), and beggarticks (Bidens frondosa), are more easily carried in from adjacent land, and their control is there - fore more difficult. The most difficult problem of weed con - trol under dry-land condition, however, is that with weeds of the tumbling type. Of these, the Russian thistle (Salsola pestifer) has the widest distribution and in many sections is a greater menace in small-grain fields than all other weeds combined. Belvedere (Kochia scoparia) , another weed of the tumbling type, in some sections in western Nebraska has in recent years largely replaced the Russian thistle. The supe - rior aggressiveness of belvedere is due to its greater frost re - sistance, larger size, and heavier seeding habit. Reduction of infestation or the eradication of weeds of this type in un - protected areas can be accomplished only by wide-scale opera - tions. On all experimental plats at this station, year-after-year clean tillage of stubble ground after harvest has decidedly reduced weeds while they have continued to increase on plats left for late fall or spring plowing. Winter wheat following corn or potatoes. — Winter wheat follows corn in nine rotations. Three of these are four-year rotations of oats, corn, and winter wheat, with a year of green manure or fallow preceding the oat crop ; two are three-year rotations of oats, corn, and winter wheat. The corn is cut with a corn binder, usually before winter-wheat seeding, fa a few years when corn harvest was delayed by late maturity, winter wheat was seeded between the corn rows with a single - horse drill, and the corn was cut and removed later. In these years, no disking was possible. In one of the two-year rota - tions, no disking of the corn ground for winter wheat was practiced at any time. Neither was any tillage given to the wheat stubble ground in this rotation previous to listing for corn. For the seven years from 1925 to 1931, disking was done on only four of the eight plats that had previously been disked except in years when seeding was done before the corn was cut. None of the eight plats averaged under the disked corn' heading in Table 6 were disked every year, but all were disked in at least half of the years and most of them in more than three-fourths of the years. .JPt lo^ st average yield of winter wheat after corn was 16.1 bushels per acre from the two-year rotation where no disking was done. The average yields of the eight plats usually disked ranged from 18.8 to 21.6 and averaged 20.4 bushels. The average yield of winter wheat in the three two - year rotations where the corn land was usually disked was </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Dry Land Crop Production 20 bushels per acre. The average yield of winter wheat after corn in the two three-year rotations was 20.4 bushels. In the four-year rotation with fallow preceding the oats crop, the winter wheat yield after corn was 20 bushels per acre. In the two four-year rotations with manures preceding the oats crop, the average yields of winter wheat after corn were 21.6 bushels with rye as the green manure and 21.2 bushels with peas as the green manure. These yields indicate | that a slight benefit from the green manures was carried over to the winter wheat. The effects of the green manures on the growth of winter wheat in these rotations is further indicated by the straw yields. While the grain yield of winter! wheat was only 6.5 per cent more in rotations with green manures than in those without the green manures, the average increase of the former in straw yields was 13.1 per cent. [Winter wheat on corn land usually does not make a heavy growth of straw and seldom lodges. In 1930, however, the straw yield of winter wheat after corn in the rotation with peas as green manure was 3.0 tons per acre and lodging was very severe. In the rotation with rye as green manure, the straw yield was 1.6 tons per acre and lodging was slight. In the rotations without the green manures, straw yields averaged 1.75 tons and there was no lodging. In most years the yield of winter wheat on the single plat following potatoes was in close agreement with the yields of winter wheat on disked corn land. The average yield was 1.2 bushels higher after potatoes. However, ih 1928, 1930, and 1931, the gains were, respectively, 11.9, li.8, and 18.6 bushels per acre. The winter-wheat yields after potatoes in 1930 and 1931 closely approached the high yields of those years on fallow. As the potatoes ordinarily grown j in this section mature considerably earlier than corn, there is a longer period for storage of moisture previous to seeding time for winter wheat. The effectiveness of moisture storage) during this period depends to a large extent upon the freedom of the potato land from weeds. The average yield of winter wheat after the cultivated crops, that is, in nine rotations after corn and in one rotation after potatoes, was 20.1 bushels per acre. This is a j gain of 3.4 bushels or 20 per cent over the 16.7 bushel per acre yield of winter wheat by all methods after small grain. An [advant - age of the corn and potato land for winter wheat is that soil moisture is usually less completely exhausted by these culti - vated crops than by the grain crops. The grain land, how - ever, has the advantage of a longer period after harvest for </seg>
            <seg id="p024">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 279 soil moisture to be restored. When this is made effective by tillage practices that control weeds, the moisture in the small - grain land may equal or exceed that in the corn land. Seas - onal variations may cause large differences in certain years, but, through a term of years, the average winter-wheat yield following corn may be expected to be about the same as that after small grain where moisture has not been lost by weed growth. The 20-year average yield of winter wheat on disked corn land in these experiments was identical with that from early fall plowing after small grain. The yield in each case was 20.4 bushels per acre. Winter wheat after fallow. — Winter wheat was grown on five plats that were prepared by summer fallow. Two of these are alternately fallow and winter wheat. One plat each occurs in the three-year, four-year and five-year rotations. Preparation is uniform for one of the alternate fallows and for the fallows in the three-year and four-year rotations. The crop preceding the fallow in these two rotations is oats. Preparation of these fallows consists of sufficient fall disking to control weeds and volunteer grain, and clean tillage dur - ing the following summer. This tillage is maintained at a minimum consistent with weed control. The usual practices are one or two spring diskings, with plowing delayed until June, followed by one to three cultivations with a duckfoot cultivator. In the five-year rotation, the crop preceding the fallow is drilled sorghum. The late growth and harvest of this crop prevents weed growth and makes fall disking, un - necessary. Cultivation during the spring and summer is the same as that of the other clean fallows. One of the alternate fallows receives no cultivation previous to plowing. It is plowed at the same time as the other fallows and receives the same cultivation after plowing. The amount of weeds and volunteer wheat that develop previous to plowing of this fallow varies with seasonal moisture, but the growth fre - quently makes a considerable amount of green manure. The average yields of the four clean-fallowed plats ranged from 27.8 to 32.8 and averaged 30.1 bushels per acre. The lowest yield was from the five-year rotation in which fallow follows sorghum. The fallow in this case has a shorter season than the others to accumulate moisture. The somewhat lighter straw growth of winter wheat in this rotation resulted in considerably less lodging than after the other clean fallows The average yield of winter wheat on the weedy fallow was 22.2 bushels. This is 7.9 bushels less than the average yield after the clean fallows and only 1.8 bushels per acre more than the yield on disked corn land or on early plowing after </seg>
            <seg id="p025">Dry Land Crop Production small grain. That is, the effect of allowing weeds and volun - teer grain to grow in the fall and spring was not greatly different from growing a crop of corn or small grain, j Fallowing is not practical unless the yields of the succeed - ing crops are increased by an amount sufficient to pay for the loss of the land during the fallow year, after allowances are made for differences in operating costs. The cultivation cost per acre of maintaining a practical fallow is usually less than the cost of producing a crop. Chilcott 3 estimates the main - tenance cost of a fallow to be only one-half the cost of pro - ducing a crop of wheat, oats, or corn. If small grains only are grown, fallow also makes possible some savings in labor distribution. If the amount of grain produced is maintained by fallow - ing part of the land, the fallow system has the savings in operating costs to its credit. If an increased amount of j grain is produced, the fallow system has this additional amount to its credit. If less grain is produced, and this reduction equals the saving in operating cost, the returns from the two systems are equal ; and if the reduction is greater than the savings in operating costs, the fallow system is less profitable. The 20-year average results with winter wheat at North Platte show that slightly more wheat was produced on half an acre after clean fallow than on an acre plowed late after small grain. One-half the acre yield after fallow was 15.1 bushels while the acre yield on late plowing after small grain was 14.7 bushels. Considering also the savings in operat - ing cost of the fallow system, it is in this case clearly more profitable. On early plowing after small grain the average acre yield of winter wheat was 20.4 bushels. This is 5.3 bushels more than half the acre yield after fallow. The value df this amount of wheat ordinarily exceeds the savings in operat - ing costs of the fallow, and the margin in this comparison is in favor of continuous cropping. j As previously stated, the yields from disking after small grains are not directly comparable to those from the other methods in these tests. The average of 16.9 bushels after disking as given in Table 6 is 1.8 bushels more than half the acre yield after fallow. The yield of 15.1 bushels obtained by omitting the rotation favored by location is just ejnial to half the acre yield after fallow. As the cost of disking stubble for two crops of wheat would not exceed the cost of maintain - * Chilcott, E. C. The Relations between crop yields and precipitation in the Great Plains area. U. S.

            <seg id="p026">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 279 ing a fallow, there would be little if any margin in favor of either method in this comparison. In comparing winter wheat after fallow with winter wheat after corn, it is necessary to consider yields and relative values of both crops. The yield of winter wheat after clean fallow was 9.7 bushels per acre more than the yield of winter wheat on disked corn land. For the same years the yield of corn was 22.1 bushels. Each bushel of wheat gained by fallow was therefore offset by 2.3 bushels of corn from the rota - tions containing corn. For the years of the tests the aver - age value of one bushel of wheat was equal to the value of 2.03 bushels of corn. The average difference in returns from the two systems was therefore slight. On account of the stimulating effects of favorable moisture conditions and relatively large amounts of available nitrogen, the early growth of winter wheat after fallow is usually very rapid. The resulting heavy growth of straw, does not, how - ever, always produce a correspondingly high yield of grain. During dry seasons, moisture is sometimes exhausted before heads are fully developed, and a low yield of poor-quality grain is produced. In seasons of excessive rainfall, lodging of winter wheat on fallow sometimes causes serious losses on account of imperfect filling and poor recovery in harvest - ing. Losses from either moisture exhaustion or from lodging would be reduced somewhat by pasturing, clipping, or any method that would check the amount of early growth. It is doubtful, however, whether such methods if practiced each year would increase average yields, for the reason that in years when moisture is low the yields probably would be re - duced about as much as they would be increased in the years when it is high. Winter wheat after green manure crops. — Green manur - ing, like fallowing, involves the loss of the land for the year of the treatment. The cost is greater than for fallowing by the value of the seed and the cost of seeding, except that cultivation costs are sometimes less for green manuring When rye is used for green manure the cost is equal to that of producing a rye crop for grain except for whatever differ - ences there may be between the costs of plowing under and harvesting the crop. The cost of seed is usually several times greater for peas than for rye. Green-manure crops use moisture from the soil in proportion to the amount of growth produced. Moisture conditions, therefore, are seldom as favorable after green manures as after fallow. Rye was plowed under soon after heading or about June 1 Peas were plowed under when they came into blossom, which was </seg>
            <seg id="p027">Dry Land Crop Production three or four weeks later than the plowing under of rye. j The longer fallow period after rye usually results in greater j stor - age of moisture than after peas. For the 20 years at the North Platte Substation, [there was but little difference between the yields of winter wheat after green manures and those after clean fallow. The higher yields occurred after each practically an equal num - ber of times, and the average yields for the entire period were practically equal. These results indicate that, for the conditions of these tests, any benefits from increased fertility resulting from green manuring in comparison with fallow were offset by the less favorable moisture conditions after the green manures. The 20-year average acre yields after rye and peas used as green manures were 30.8 and 29.5 bushels, respectively.' The higher yield after rye is apparently due to the longer season for accumulation of moisture after the crop is plowed under. A higher soil-nitrate content after peas is indicated by j some - what later maturity of winter wheat and by more frequent and more severe lodging of the crop. Winter survival of winter wheat. — One of the hazards in winter-wheat production in western Nebraska is uncertain winter survival. Some reduction of stand occurs in at least half the years. The losses may be due to one factor or to a combination of several. Smothering may take place I under ice sheets formed by sleet or partially melted snow, j Very low temperatures, occurring suddenly after growth has been started by periods of milder weather or when there is no snow cover, sometimes result in considerable injury. &gt; High winds and soil blowing in some years cause heavy damage. The most frequent losses, however, are those resulting from insufficient moisture. Plants that are weakened by [a low moisture supply in the fall, or that are subjected to long periods of dry weather during the winter, frequently [have a low survival. Under favorable spring conditions, thin stands are some - times improved by the tillering of surviving plants. '■ Under unfavorable conditions, however, weak plants continue to die until after the normal time for the beginning of i spring growth. In the 20 years from 1912 to 1931 at North Platte, winter killing was an important factor in four years. There I was no survival in 1917, a few plats were abandoned in 1918, in 1923 the abandonment was over 60 per cent, and in 1926 it was almost complete. Of 533 plats seeded in the 20 years, 71 were reseeded with spring wheat or did not produce crops </seg>
            <seg id="p028">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 279 Z°£h **%**&amp;*' This is a loss of 13.3 per cent of the area seeded. The percentages of abandonment for the various methods of seed-bed preparation were as follows: fallow 7 5 - green manure, 10; early plowing after small grain, 141 : corn land, 14.4; potato land, 15; and late plowing after small Winter Rye — Winter-rye yields, as previously shown, averaged 82 per cent of the winter-wheat yields for the 11-year period from 1921 to 1931. For the 20-year period from 1911 to 1930, the average December 1 farm price of rye in Nebraska was 72 per cent of the average winter wheat price. * On account of its lower yielding capacity and lower market value, winter rye is not a competitor of winter wheat on the heavier soils of western Nebraska.

            <seg id="p030">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 279 results with spring grains In the south half of the panhandle and in all of the south - western section of Nebraska, the spring grains are less profitable and less extensively grown than winter wheat and corn. There are, however, advantages in the growing of spring grains, and under certain conditions their use in a limited way in the cropping system is justified. Among the advantages are better distribution of labor and use of machin - ery on account of differences in the time of seeding and har - vesting spring grains and other crops. Differences in time pf maturity also distribute to some extent risks of drouth losses, although fall-seeded grains are more frequently favor - ed m this respect. On account of lodged stalks and late weed growth, seeding of fall grains in corn fields is at times not satisfactory. In these cases spring grains may be used to advantage as intermediate crops between corn and winter wheat in crop rotations. As emergency crops for reseeding abandoned winter wheat areas, the spring grains are of con - siderable importance. The popularity of barley and oats as feed crops has a great deal to do with maintaining the acre - ages of these crops. Spring Wheat.— Spring wheat, in Field 41, was grown for 25 years continuously on two plats, after oats in three rotations, after corn in 11 rotations, after sorghum in one rotation, after fallow in one rotation, and on one of two plats alternately fallowed. In Field 49, spring wheat was grown for 20 years in four rotations in which the respective crops or treatment preceding it were fallow, peas for green manure rye for green manure, and potatoes. Annual and average spring wheat yields are given in Table 8. Yields from continuous cropping of spring wheat and those after oats in rotations are similar and are grouped together and given under the headings of "Spring plowed" and "Fall plowed in the first two columns of the table.

            <seg id="p035">Dry Land Crop Production gained by fallow was therefore offset by 2 bushels of corn produced in the rotations containing both crops. Green manuring for oats produced about the same results with either peas or rye as the green manure crop. In the 25 years, the higher yield followed rye 13 times and peas' 12 times. The difference of 0.7 bushel per acre in favor of peas is too small to be significant. The yields of oats after !rye and after peas for green manure exceeded those after fallow only three times each in 25 years. These results indicate that in these tests fertility was less frequently a dominant fac - tor than moisture in determining the yields of oats. The importance of moisture is further indicated by the low yields of oats after sorghum, brome grass, and alfalfa in the rotations. When moisture was plentiful early in the season, oats after alfalfa made a vigorous growth. The moisture supply seldom was sufficient to support this stimulated grojwth to maturity, and low yields usually resulted. Oats after, alfalfa yielded higher than all other methods only once in 25 years. This was in the exceedingly wet year of 1915. [The 25-year average yield of 20.4 bushels per acre of oats after alfalfa was the lowest obtained from any method or crop sequence. The second lowest yield was 23.8 bushels after sorghum, and the third lowest yield was 24.1 bushels after brome grass. Barley. — Barley was grown in Field 41 for 25 years, on two plats continuously cropped, after oats in one rotajtion, after corn in one rotation, and on one of two plats alternately fallowed. In Field 49, barley was grown for 11 years inl one rotation after oats, in two rotations after rye, in four rota - tions after corn, in four rotations after milo, and in one rota - tion after fallow. The yields from the two fields are bum - marized in Table 10. Yields from continuous cropping of barley and in dota - tions after oats and rye are grouped according to tillage prac - tices and shown under the previous crop heading of small grains in the first three columns of the table. For the 11 years from 1921 to 1931 inclusive, the single plat spring - disked after oats averaged 1.1 bushels more per acre than the three plats spring-plowed after oats or rye. On account of the scattering locations of the rotations, this difference is not considered significant. The 25-year average yield after small grain was 5 bushels or 26.5 per cent more on fall plowing than on spring plowing. The two adjacent plats continuously cropped to barley are included in this comparison. Plowing in the fall was done early and weed growth was controlled, while on land left for spring plowing weeds were not dis- </seg>

The higher yields from fall plowing are thought to be due to the more favorable conditions for moisture storage and nitrification made possible by control of weeds under that treatment. While barley on disked corn land averaged 4.5 bushels per acre less than on early plowing after small grain, this differ - ence, on account of the small number of plats in the compari - sons and rather wide distances separating the rotations, is probably not significant. Barley on disked corn land lout - yielded that on disked milo land by an average of 2.4 bushels per acre for the 11 years from 1921 to 1931. After fallow the 25-year average yield of barley was 32.6 bushels per acre. The acre yield of barley on fall plowing after small grain exceeded half the acre yield after fallow by 7.6 bushels. As the value of this amount of grain is greater than the savings in operating cost for the area fallowed! the fallow system in these tests was less profitable than growing barley after small grains on early fall plowing. The average yield of barley after fallow was 13.2 bushels more per acre than the yield on disked corn land. With a corn yield of 20.9 bushels per acre, each bushel of barley gained by fallowing is offset by 1.6 bushels of corn which would have been produced if the fallow had been replaced by corn. As the price per bushel of corn usually exceeded j that of barley, the fallow system for barley was less profitable in these tests than barley after corn. results with cultivated crops Corn. — Corn was grown in Field 41 for 25 years on two plats continuously cropped to corn, after oats in 14 rotations, after spring wheat in three rotations, after barley in one rotation, after sorghum in one rotation, and on one of two plats alternately fallowed. In Field 49, corn was grown for 20 years after oats in six rotations, after spring wheat in three rotations, and after winter wheat in nine rotations, and for 11 years after wheat in one rotation, after rye in two rotations, after barley in two rotations, and after milo in one rotation. \. All plantings, regardless of other preparation, were made in listed furrows. In most years, an excess amount of seed was planted, and the stands were thinned to an average dis - tance of two feet between plants in the row. Variations in final stands were seldom large enough to affect yields. Culti - vation was uniform for all plats, and usually consisted of two cultivations with listed-corn machinery and a final cultiva - tion with shovel cultivators.

            <seg id="p039">Dry Land Crop Production Corn after small grains. — Yields after small grains are grouped according to four tillage practices. Listing in winter wheat stubble without previous preparation was practiced in one two-year rotation for 20 years, and in barley andj rye stubble in two other rotations for 11 years. It was usually necessary to remove the dead weeds from the land before!list - ing, and the spring growth of volunteer winter grains ! and weeds sometimes made listing difficult. The yield of corn fol - lowing winter wheat listed without disking was below the average yield of corn from all plats in the same field 16 times in 20 years, and its average yield was 3.9 bushels less than the average of all plats. The three rotations in which small-grain stubble has been disked before listing to corn are in the same field and so located that the results for the same years are comparable to those in which the grain stubble land was not disked for corn. The 11-year average yield of corn was 23.9 from the undisked plats and 27 bushels from the disked plats. On account of differences in location and the numbers of plats represented, the corn yields from listing only and from disking and listing are not comparable with those after small grain where the land was plowed in either spring or fall. Between spring plowing and fall plowing, however, the re - sults are more comparable. For the 25-year period the gain of fall plowing over spring plowing was 1.9 bushels per acre. For the larger number of comparisons for the 20-year period, the gain of fall plowing was 2.3 bushels per acre. The gains from fall plowing are due to more favorable moisture conditions resulting from weed control during late summer and fall. The plats left for spring plowing usually became weedy after harvest, and soil-moisture storage was very limited. Corn following sorghum or milo. — The lowest average yield of corn from any treatment and sequence was on fall plowing after sorghum. For the 25-year period, thej yield was 15.6 bushels per acre, or 5.7 bushels less than thei aver - age yield on fall plowing after small grain. The lowj yield of corn after sorghum is due to unfavorable moisture con - ditions. Sorghum exhausts soil moisture very thoroughly, and its late summer growth shortens the time for moisture storage after the crop is matured. In years of high rainfall, like 1909, 1915, 1923, and 1927, corn yields after sorghum compared favorably with those after small grain. In j years of low rainfall, the yields were consistently below those from any other method. </seg>

For the entire period average grain yields from continuous cropping of corn remained above those of corn after small grain in crop rotations, but continuous cropping resulted in a progressive decrease in plant vigor and ability to respond to favorable growing conditions. As smaller plants have a lower water requirement, they are at an advantage in dry seasons. On this account, the grain yields from continuous cropping were not reduced in proportion to the reduction in vegetative vigor. Cumulative yields of both grain and stover are shown graphically in Figure 4.

            <seg id="p043">Dry Land Crop Production duction from continuous cropping fell below the stover yield after small grain. From that time the cumulative stover yields from continuous cropping began to fall below 'those following small grain; that is, beginning with 1919, relative grain yields from the two methods continued without much change in relationship. These results indicate that continuous cropping of i corn, under dry-land conditions, may be expected to produce in - creased yields for a term of perhaps 10 to 15 years. I This will, however, be associated with a progressive decrease in plant vigor which will finally result in decreased yields of grain and stover, with stover yields decreasing at thej more rapid rate. Potatoes. — Potatoes were grown in Field 49 in six 3-year rotations, for 20 years. Plantings were made about April 10th to 20th. Early planting and the use of early varieties allowed the crop to develop before the season of highest sum - mer temperatures, reduced the development of certain jpotato diseases, and permitted harvest in time for the planting of winter wheat. The rotations are located on land that varies somewhat in slope and soil texture. Rotations 105, 106, and 107 are on land that is comparatively flat and which occasionally re - ceives run-off water from surrounding areas. The land of the other rotations slopes gently, and the soil becomes lighter in the direction of the rotations having the higher numbers. On account of these differences, yield comparisons aire not accurate between widely separated rotations. This is especially true of the yields for any one year. The long-time averages are more comparable, as the advantages of location shift with variations in moisture. In dry seasons the crop on the lower land is at an advantage and produces thej higher yields. In wet seasons there is an excess of moisture j on the lower land, and the crop on the lighter, more sloping land pro - duced the higher yields. As the changes in slope and soil type are not abrupt, adjacent rotations are fairly comparable. In Table ! 13 the yields are arranged according to rotation pairs. The first comparison is between disking winter-wheat stubble for pota - toes in Rotation 131 and early fall plowing oats stubble for potatoes in Rotation 109. As the effects of different grains upon the succeeding crops are essentially the same, the differ - ences in yield are chiefly due to the differences in tillage. The yield of potatoes on fall-plowed land was higher than the yield on spring-disked land 13 times in 20 years, and the average gain on fall plowing was 12.2 bushels per acre, or 13.3 per </seg>

            <seg id="p045">Dry Land Crop Production The second comparison is between early fall plowing for potatoes after oats in Rotation 108 and fallow for potatoes in Rotation 107. The higher yield was after fallow 14 [times in 20 years. The average gain in potato yields after fallow was 11.4 bushels per acre, or 10.8 per cent. Large gains from fallow were secured in only two years. In 1922 the gain was 100.5 bushels or 124.8 per cent, and in 1926 the gain was 104 bushels, or 78 per cent. In 1917, 1918 and 1919, gains on fallow exceeded 30 bushels per acre. On the other hand, in 1923 and 1927 when heavy rains during the growing season caused water logging on fallow, the yields were below those on fall plowing after oats by 62.9 and 74.5 bushels per acre, respectively. On the basis of all crops, average yields, and farm prices for the time covered, the returns from Rotations 107 and 108 were approximately equal. The yield of oats after pota - toes in Rotation 107 was 41.8 bushels and in Rotation 108 after spring wheat 27.1 bushels. Rotation 107 therefore pro - duced 14.7 bushels more oats as well as 11.4 bushels: more potatoes per acre than Rotation 108. Rotation 108 produced an average acre yield of 15.5 bushels of spring wheat, and no wheat was grown in Rotation 107. The average December 1st, Nebraska farm prices per bushel for the years of the test were as follows: potatoes, 96 cents ; oats, 39 cents ; and wheat, $1.12. The value taf the excess yields of potatoes and oats from Rotation 107 was, therefore, $16.67, and the value of the wheat produced in Rotation 108 was $17.36. The difference of 69 cents in favor of Rotation 108 amounts to only 23 cents per acre. If winter wheat instead of spring wheat had been used, however, the wheat yield as indicated by the results from Rotation 109 would have been increased by 6.1 bushels. Cropping all the land each year would then have been somewhat more [profit - able than fallowing one-third of it. The third comparison is between spring disking for pota - toes after corn in Rotation 106 and early fall plowing for potatoes after winter wheat in Rotation 105. For the first 10 years, the higher yields of potatoes were from each method an equal number of times, and the averages were about the same. For the last 10 years, the lower yields were after corn each year, and the average difference between the two methods was 63 bushels per acre. In Rotation 105 the in - crease in the yields of potatoes for the second 10 years over the first 10 years was 94 per cent. In Rotation 106, the sec - ond-period increase was only 18 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 279 Several factors probably contributed to the relative failure of potatoes after corn to respond to the larger number of more favorable seasons during the later years. Further studies will be necessary to determine the exact causes. Available nitrogen may be an important factor. No de - terminations for nitrates were made in these rotations but studies made in other rotations indicate that there is 'little or no accumulation of nitrates in soils upon which a corn crop is growing, but that nitrification is very active and nitrates are accumulated in early fall-plowed grain stubble land when moisture conditions are favorable. Potato diseases, particularly fusarium wilt, stem-end rot, and scab have become troublesome in all of these rotations. Disease determinations were made B on 100-pound samples from Rotations 106, 107, and 108 in 1930, and from all rota - tions except No. 131 in 1931. Fusarium and stem-end rot infections on No. 1 sizes from these samples ranged from 47.6 to 55.5 per cent in 1930 and from 62.7 to 85.8 per cent in 1931. These large percentages of diseased tubers obviously reduce the quality and market - ability of the crop. The effect upon yield is not so readily determined, but the large yield increases during the later years in all rotations except No. 106 indicate that yield was not greatly influenced by the increasing amount of disease. It seems possible that the corn roots and stubble were better hosts for carrying over the diseases than the grain stubbles of the other rotations, and that the resulting heavier disease infection might be a contributing cause of the lower yields from Rotation 106. The determinations made, however, failed to show a heavier infection in this rotation. Milo. — Milo was grown in four rotations after small grain and in one rotation after corn for 11 years from 1921 to 1931. All milo plats were spring-plowed and surface-planted either with a corn planter or grain drill with part of the spouts stopped so as to space the rows 40 inches apart. Yields are given in Table 14. The yield of the single plat after corn exceeded the average of the four plats after small grain 6 times in 11 years and averaged 2.7 bushels, or 10.2 per cent, higher. results with sorghum Sorghum was grown in Field 41 for 25 years, in three three-year rotations in which the crops preceding it were, respectively, spring wheat, oats, and corn and for 19 years Nrt'S. e k. d!^rtoS n S , SSor W6re m " de by * W - G0M - PUnt »»*■« °&lt; *• </seg>

The yield records for 1910 were lost, and that year is not considered in the aver - ages, j The land was prepared for sorghum by spring plowing in four rotations.
