            <seg id="p011">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 11 BIENNIAL REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION INTRODUCTORY In presenting to you the Sixteenth Biennial Report of the Department of Labor I cannot refrain from commenting upon the phenomena! growth of the industries of our state, as is evidenced by the statistical part of this report. The increased acreage of crops the past year attests the fact that Nebraska has not yet reached her capacity for production. Not only so, but it shows that she is heart and soul with the President and the government in their work to win the War. It is well to note that the report of the Compensation Commis - sioner is also included in this report. This is due to the fact that the Commissioner of Labor has been deputized to take care of this in addi - tion to his other duties. During my tenure of office it has been my constant aim to increase the efficiency of the department wherever possible. The war has greatly added to the work of the Commissioner. The Department of Labor is co-operating in every way with the government in its efforts to make labor efficient because we recognize that the success of the war depends in no small way upon the labor of the country. The government has created two new bureaus in the United States Department of Labor; one is called the Public Service Reserve, and the other the United States Employment Service. Their duty is to supply the employer with labor and to secure positions for those in need of employment where they will be able to do the most good. Both of these bureaus are working largely through the labor bureaus of the various states. If the work of this office is to be done well it will, there - fore, require the service of more clerks, and it need hardly be added that Nebraska does not desire to be behind any of our sister states in their efforts to render efficient stewardship to the government in this hour of her greatest need. RECOMMENDATIONS It has been noted by citations from the law the numerous duties im - posed on the Labor Commissioner. To carry on this work only a limited number of clerks can be kept, owing to the small appropriations. We cannot help but feel that the importance of the work to be done by this office is not truly sensed by the people of the state. A comparison of the appropriations of some of our neighboring states whose conditions </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT are very similar to our own will help make this point clear. Kansas, for example, for the same work appropriated upwards of $80,000.00 for the biennium, Missouri, $42,000.00, Minnesota, $56,000.00. The above cited appropriations do not include such items as printing, postage, etc. The Kansas Department of Labor employs 15 people, Missouri 10, and Minnesota 20. In Nebraska, where the labor conditions are quiet analagous t &gt; the states just mentioned, but $9,000.00 are appropriated for the biennium. Besides this, printing and postage, office supplies, etc., must be taken from this amount. Then the legislature of 1917 added the Compensation work to the Department. Only $2,500.00 for the bienniun* were appro - priated for this work. This makes the total appropriation to maintain the Labor Department and the Compensation work only $11,500.00. As compared with the three states named above it will be seen that Ne - braska is far and away behind her sister states, in adequately caring for the labor conditions of the state. Since the United States has entered into the war the duties of this office have doubled. A glance at the regular duties imposed by law, to say nothing of the new ones, will give some idea of the magnitude of the work to be done. According to the law, "The duties of the Com - missioner shall be to collect, collate, and publish statistics and facts relative to manufactures, industrial classes, and material resources of the state, and especially to examine into the relations between labor and capital; the mean* of escape from fire and protection of life and health in factories and workshops, mines and other places of industries; the employment of illegal child labor; the exaction of unlawful hours of labor from any employee; the educational, sanitary, moral, and finan - cial conditions of laborers and artisans; the cost of food, fuel, clothing, and building material; the causes of strikes and lockouts, as well as kindred subjects and matters pertaining to the welfare of industrial interests and classes." To carry on all this work we are permitted to have but one regular stenographer. We may, it is true, employ extra help from time to time, but so mahy clerks coming and going, makes against efficiency. Not only so, but the salaries we are allowed to pay are not adequate to meet the increased cost of living. This makes it hard to retain com - petent clerks because they can secure more pay elsewhere. We there - fore rcommend, first, that an increase in salary be granted to the Chief Deputy Commissioner and the entire office force. Secondly, that permission be given to employ at least two permanent clerks, and not less than three factory inspectors. Nebraska spends less for the Department of Labor than any other state in the Union. It certainly is not because there is less need here than elsewhere, but it is because we have not come to realize the im - portance of this department in dealing with labor conditions. Some states which do not have the economic importance that Nebraska enjoys spend more than three times as much as we do for the maintenance of </seg>
            <seg id="p013">STATE DEPARTMENT OP LABOR 13 their labor bureaus. We therefore recommend that an appropriation of $20,000 for the biennium be made so the Department of Labor may be able to carry out the enforcement of the law more efficiently; that an appropriation be made to help maintain the free employment offices established throughout the state by the government in co-operation with the State Department of Labor. The following extract, taken from the Em - ployment Bulletin of the Public Service Reserve, makes clear what is wanted: "The United States Employment Service is a national service and therefore the national interests will at all times prevail. The em - ployment service in each state should be conducted on a co-operative basis between the state and nation; and each state should ultimately be expected to share the expense with the Federal Government." This shows the degree of importance the government has attached to labor, and money thus expended by the state will come back to us many times by increasing the efficiency of labor distribution, and at the same time increasing the productive capacity of the commonwealth. Last year, with the co-operation of the United States government and the Department of Agricultural Extension of the University of Nebraska, we placed more than thirteen thousand people in positions. This year these figures are more than doubled, but we have not been able to co - operate with the government as we should because of lack of funds. Indeed the offices opened by the government at Omaha, Lincoln, North Platte and Hastings was the result of our inability through insufficient appropriation to meet the situation. Without question the duty of this department is to serve those in the market to purchase labor and the laborer himself who seeks employ - ment. However, this takes careful organization, and this in turn calls for more money than we now command. </seg>

            <seg id="p015">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 15 LABOR AND THE INCREASED COST OF LIVING One of the greatest problems with us now and the one that will very likely bear closely on labor agitation in the future, is the increased cost of living. Prices have gone up by leaps and bounds. For the present labor has thrown its differences aside and is standing nobly by the president in his prosecution of the war. The following occurring in one of the labor publications is thoroughly indicative of the stand of labor in this war: "We must eliminate from our daily lives the non - essentials. We must have but one thought — to strike the blow that will forever free the world from the nightmare of Prussian militarism." But when this war is over labor is going to insist upon its rights, and the cost of living, if an equilibrium is not found, is going to prove a serious problem. It is at least interesting to conjecture on the action labor will take should it be convinced that action is necessary. The average laborer with an average sized family is finding it diffi - cult to support his family, to say nothing of educating them, because of the great increase in the cost of living. In many cases the increase in wages of the laboring man has not been commensurate with the rise in prices of the necessaries of life. This is going to be the cause of social unrest unless adjustment comes. The United States Government, through its Department of Labor, has been making some careful investigations on the cost of living, and following are its findings which are worthy of the careful consideration of all who may be interested in the subject: Distribution of total family expenditures. Increase for Increase as applied War period. to total budget. The distribution of budget items just given is an average based on cost of living studies made by several United States Government bureaus and other agencies covering in all 12,000 families. The proportions of these major items of expenditure can be varied within narrow limits, but no reasonable arrangement would cause a wide change in the increase in the total cost of living as given above. If, for example, instead of this average distribution of the budget, food be allocated as much as 45%, rent and clothing 15% each, fuel and light 5% and sundries 20%, the indicated increase in the total cost of living would be 54%. Great differences in local conditions and in standards of living among individual families, any average of increase can be applied only in a broad way. A range of 50% to 55% is, however, considered fairly representative of the increase in living costs for the majority of In- •ood tent _ nothing •uel and light undries Average .. 43.1% .. 17.7% .. 13.2% .. 5.6% .. 20.4% 62%.... 15%.... 77%.... 46%.... 50%... ...26.72% ... 2.66% ...10.16% ... 2.52% .10.20% ...52.30% </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT dustrial communities. If these figures are to be used as a basis for readjusting wages, local studies must be made of changes in rent, which have shown marked differences in different communities. Thus, if in a given community rent had advanced as much as 70%, the increase in the total cost of living would range from 60% to 65%. The estimate of 45% as in the rise in the cost of fuel, will also have to be increased for some communities; but this would have only a slight effect on the increase in the budget as a whole because of the relatively small expenditure for fuel. Following consideration is given the items individually listed in above table. FOOD All articles of food show a considerable increase in price since 1914. Exceptional advances were recorded in prices of flour, lard and corn meal. Hhe most sensational advance occurred in the case of potatoes, which, in spring of 1917, were quoted at more than three times the 1914 price; in 1918, however, the greater part of this advance had been elim - inated. There have been investigaitons on cost of living made by a number of agencies and lnstitutoins ; among these, besides the Department of Labor at Washington, are the Ship Building Wage Adjustment Board, the United States Railroad Wage Commission, Bankers Trust Company of New York, and others. In general there was a marked agreement among them that the increase in the cost of food from the outbreak of the war to the spring of 1918 was 50% to 55%. Since it is known that some further increases in food prices have been made in recent months, the National Industrial Conference Board accepts the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics figure of 62% as the total increase which has occurred from the outbreak of the war to the middle of June, 1918. RENT Changes in rent showed such wide variation that no general average applicable to all sections of the country could be reached. However, it is estimated that 15% is sufficient to cover the increase in this item up to the early summer of 1918 for a very large proportion of industrial communities. It is predicted that a further increase' in rent may be looked for this fall. CLOTHING Information secured from retail stores in cities well distributed throughout the country indicate increases in prices of the most common articles of wearing apparel ranging from 50.5% for women's dollar blouses up to 161% for men's overalls. Striking increases occurred in the prices of certain yard goods, where advances in cost over 1914 prices amounted to more than 100%. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">STATE DEPARTMENT OP LABOR 17 Men's hosiery, selling for 15 cents in 1914, cost in June, 1918, usually not less than 25 cents, and women's hosiery selling for 25 cents four years ago, brought 45 cents in June of this year. Women's shoes of a standard kind increased 88.5%; men's 69%. Women's kid gloves which in 1914 cost one dollar average more than two dollars in June, 1918. The average rise in the total clothing budget, since 1914, is 77%. FUEL AND LIGHT Prices secured from coal dealers in different localities frequently showed advances of 20% to 40% up to June. 1918, for ton lots of anthracite, and more marked increases in the cost of bituminous coal, which is extensively used for domestic purposes in some sections of the country. Manufactured and natural gas used for household purposes showed but slight change from the 1914 rates up to April, 1918; a number of communities reported a decrease. It is estimated that an average allowance of 45% of increase in the cost of fuel and light within the last four years is not only sufficient, but probably liberal for most communities. Inasmuch as fuel represents only 5% or 6% of the total family budget, a further increase of as much as 20% in the cost of fuel and light would add 1% to the increase in the total cost of living. SUNDRIES Food, rent, clothing, fuel and light constitute 80% of the family budget, where we find an average increase of 52%. For sundry items the increase is 50%. Sundries represent expenditures for living rather than for necessary cost of living, and there is a great variation in the amounts expended under this head. Hence all figures under this item are mere estimated. Under this head we may include such things as carfare, insurance, theatre tickets and tobacco. The following taken from a bulletin published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor, is a specific in - stance of articles of diet which will show price conditions and cost of living: PRICES AND COST OF LIVING Retail Prices of Food in the United States Retail prices of food as reported to the Bureau of Labor Statistics for July, 1918, show, for all articles combined, an increase of 3% as com - pared with June, 1918. The prices of several articles decreased. The five cuts of fresh beef show a decline of 1%, each. Of the other articles which decreased in price, navy beans were 2% cheaper, and lard, lamb, and coffee decreased less than five-tenths of 1% each. Bread, flour, and corn meal did not change in price in the month. A comparison of retail food prices for July 15, 1918, with those for </seg>

The cheaper cuts of beef, plate boiling beef and chuck roast, advanced 36% and 33% respectively. These cuts advanced more than sirloin steak, which in - creased in price 29%. Hens were 36% higher than a year ago. Lard, pork chops, bacon, ham, and lamb show increases ranging from 19% for lard to 25% for lamb. Five articles — beans, potatoes, flour, coffee, and bread — were cheaper than in July, 1917.

Because the tomorrow never comes, And the yesterday has gone to stay; To make our lives most successful We should do our very best today." </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT The idea has been floating in the minds of many people that the chief function of the Department of Labor was to gather and compile statistics on labor and the labor problems in the state, and to print these in bulletins and the biennial report. If, indeed, this was its only func - tion it would have little cause to exist. It does, to be sure, attend to all this kind of work, but this is one of the least of its duties. In addi - tion it takes an active part in the distribution of labor over the state when and where it is needed and in this work the Department co - operates with the Labor Department of other states and these in turn receive help from the Nebraska Bureau as will be seen later in this report. Following we give an account of some of the activities of the De - partment of Labor. To begin with it has been instrumental in helping collect wages for men and women whose employers are sometimes for - getful of their obligations. From May 1st, 1917, to December 1st, 1918, wages to the amount of $12,678.00 were collected through the help of this department. Adjustments of wage disputes were also mad 3 between the railroads, packing houses and others and the employees. A great many complaints have been made for the non-payment of wages by employees, and it is gratifying to know that settlement i.i all cases has been made satisfactory to employee and employer. Our whole aim is to be fair and just in all our settlements because by this means we gain confidence and so are able to render more efficient service to the state. There have been a number of complaints for violation of tho 9-hour female labor law and several others for violation of the 8-hour child labor law. A number of complaints have also been made of un - sanitary conditions in factory or shop. In all these cases the spirit and the letter of the law have been enforced in the interests of the social well-being of the laborer and the employer as well, for it is now almost axiomatic that the physical comfort of the employee is a finan - cial asset to the employer. During this biennium, 3,749 factory inspections and inspections of other lines of business have been made. There are three things which merited special attention: Safety appliances, dressing rooms, and sani - tary conditions generally. By reverting to the law in another part of this report, it will be seen that it is very clear and specific in its de - mands upon the employer to provide safety for his employees and proper sanitary conditions as well. In quite a few instances, dressing rooms and toilets have been required as a result of these inspections. We are glad to note that hearty co-operation of employers has been accorded our recommendations. In most instances, they have been glad for sug - gestions and have willingly complied with them. With these introductory remarks, we will now consider the activi - ties of the State Labor Bureau during 1917 and 1918, especially em - phasizing its handling of the labor situation throughout the state, such </seg>
            <seg id="p021">STATE DEPARTMENT OP LABOR 21 as laborers for harvest, etc. Early last year when it seemed certain that labor would be a limiting factor in the increased production of food, plans for a state-wide labor bureau system to bring farmers and em - ployees together were mapped out, and local labor bureaus were es - tablished in all parts of the state. These bureaus were to list all avail - able labor and all calls for labor, bring idle men in touch with farmers, and report any excess or deficiency to a county labor bureau which was to be directed by some county organization. The county bureau in turn was to canvass its labor situation and report to the State Labor Bureau at Lincoln. By arrangement with the Governor and the State Department of Labor, all labor bureau work of the state was to be handled through the state bureau at Lincoln. The United States De - partment of Agriculture and the United States Department of Labor each furnished additional help to conduct the labor bureau work at the Lincoln office. Speakers were sent out upon request of the extension service to explain the labor bureau system to organizations in county seat towns and help in the organization of local labor bureaus. The Burlington railroad also sent out several men to organize towns along their lines through their agricultural department at Chicago. On account of the winter wheat being badly winter-killed over the greater part of the state, corn acreage was greatly increased, which called for a considerable number of extra workers. However, this had the effect of extending the work over a greater period, so that the labor shortage was not nearly so great as had been expected or would have been, had there been a good wheat crop. Later in the season, the corn crop being greatly in excess of former years, demands for men to husk corn became imperative. A survey was made at the Nebraska State Fair in September, 1917, to ascertain the help situation direct from the farmers, which resulted in the conclusion being reached that outside help in great numbers must be had if the corn crop was not to go to waste. News items stating Nebraska's needs were inserted in news - papers of wide circulation. These brought a quick and generous re - sponse from other states where there was a surplus of help at this season. Thousands of men were induced to come to Nebraska so that plenty of help was secured. The Lincoln office gathered accurate and reliable information of the needs of the different parts of the state and workers were directed where they wre most needed. From the experience gained during the past year, we have come to the conclusion that during the coming year we will endeavor to cen - tralize the labor bureau system so as to have an active bureau located at the most strategic railroad points throughout the state and to handle labor more by districts adjacent to the central bureau rather than by local bureaus in every town. That no disastrous labor shortage occurred in Nebraska during the past year, we feel that full credit should be given to the various local organizations throughout the state. We wish </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT especially to acknowledge the services of Prof. C. W. Pugsley and Mr. E. L. Rhoades of the Agricultural Extension Department of the Uni - versity of Nebraska. In pursuance of the policy announced, bureaus have been estab - lished at Hastings and North Platte, in addition to the ones already established at Omaha and Lincoln. This has resulted in a closer cen - tralized work, and has been the means of filling the labor demand throughout the entire state more quickly and satisfactorily than for the year 1917. In times of great labor demand, it is not only necessary to have labor, but to have it quickly, and this is the key-note of the organi - zation for 1918 to meet the labor needs throughout the state. A comparison of the following tables will show the great increase of labor placed in 1918 over 1917: Year of 1917. Persons Actually Employed Male. Female.

            <seg id="p024">24 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT In this time of storm and stress, when the United States is engaged in a titanic struggle to help put down once and for all the fell ideal of a military autocracy, many new and perplexing problems are presenting themselves as a by-product of this same struggle. While the nation has surprised the world in her ability to organize her forces and put men in the field, yet it has also revealed to thinking people many weaknesses in our social fabric. Not the least of these problems is that of securing labor when and where it is needed most. Not only official Washington, but the public generally, have come to recognize as never before the important place labor occupies in our life. We cannot help but feel that this will result in a more careful study of labor and its problems and this is precisely what we wish to see come. In the past and even at present time capital and labor have been arrayed against each other in bitter struggles and these have come to have great social significance. Crimination and re-crimination are more often than not a result of misunderstanding, and if the parties concerned would stop and look at things soberly it would be much easier to get together and settle dif - ferences. The early labor organizations were a failure and committed egregious blunders because the laborer, inexperienced in organization, and ignorant of conditions, was no match for capital. They were chiefly successful in arraying public opinion against them, and retarded the progress of their cause for years. However, labor has been an apt pupil and it is today developing men of ability and capacity who are able to lend dignity to the labor movement and to secure a favorable hearing before the public. When we have put aside the failures and mistakes of labor we find that it has for the most part been patriotic and public-spirited through - out our entire history, and has stood for some of the most salient fea - tures of our national life. It has been instrumental in bringing progress to our educational system and has generally stood for those things which mean social betterment. There is no surer way to learn the truth about a movement than to study its history. By this means we are able to get at the truth of the matter and weigh the evidence. The importance of labor is so great that no one should be ignorant of what it has done in the past, what it is doing today and its possibilities for the future. There Is little excuse for anyone not to acquaint himself with the truth about labor. In order that we may do our bit in getting the people to study labor and its problems, we herewith offer a review of the book entitled "A History of Labor", by Professor John R. Commons and associates. It is worthy the careful perusal of everyone and we hope that it will result In a desire to learn more of the fundamental facts of the labor movement in this country. "The History of Labor," Professor Farnam points out, "was originally in charge of Carroll D. Wright, who secured the preparation and publi - cation of considerable monographic and documentary material which </seg>
            <seg id="p025">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 25 he expected to use In writing the history, but who did not live to com plete the work," to which Professor Commons has succeeded. The spirit in which the present work is undertaken is reflected in Professor Far - nam's statement that "The United States has always been fertile in social experiments, in societies for the propagation of fads, in periodicals and books written to aid a cause or a doctrine destined in the minds of the few to whom they were revealed to bring in a new era for the human race. Many of the theories advanced have been crude and fallacious and have died with, or even before, their authors. Many of the re - formers have failed to realize their plans. Yet this intellectual ebulli - tion has left a certain deposit of sound ideals and practical methods. These have had to compete with traditional convictions, with vested interests, and with existing law, and the resultant of these often an - tagonistic forces has determined the color and character of our social history." Protessor commons in his introduction states that "The labor history of the country is here treated as a part of its industrial and political history. It is the story of how, in the course of three centuries, the wage-earner, as a distinct class, has been gradually, even violently, sep - arating himself from the farmer, the merchant, and the employer, and coming to feel that his standing and progress in society depend directly on wages and not directly on prices, rents, profits or interest." Part I of the work, "Colonial and Federal Beginnings to 1827," is written by David J. Saposs, who first traces the industrial development of the American colonies through Government loans or bounties for the encouragement of iron and textile manufacturing, fishing and seafaring — and monopolies granted to the first manufacturers. Later protective duties were imposed by the colonies themselves before the establishment of independence. "These instances indicate," says the author, "that the protective policy of the early colonial period was intended to benefit the country at large and to make it self-sufficient. The second period of protection on a national scale began with the organization of mechanics and tradesmen following the Revolutionary War. Here originated the two slogans, 'Patronize home industry' and 'Protect infant industry' which eventually served to lift the master mechanic to the level of the capi - talist." Employers and employees in our early history joined frankly and heartily in support of the protectionist policy favored by Washington — as indicated in this letter written by the New York Mechanics and Trades - men's Society in 1787, to the Associated Mechanics of Boston: We are sensible that long habit has fixed in the mind of the people an unjust predilection for foreign productions, and has rendered them too regardless of the arguments and complaints with which the patriotic and discerning have addressed them from every quarter. These preju - dices have become confirmed and radical, and we are convinced that a strong and united effort is necessary to expel them. The Legislature of our State, convinced of the propriety of cherishing our manufactures in their early growth, has made some provisions for that purpose, and we have, no doubt, but more comprehensive and decisive measures will in </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT time be taken. But on the exertions of our brethren, and especially upon the patronage and protection of the general government, we rest our most flattering hopes of success. When our views like our interests are combined and concentrated, our petitions to the federal legislature will assume the tone and complexion of the public wishes, and will have a proportionate weight and influence. Thus the Pennsylvania Society to Encourage Manufactures says in its report in 1788: We have, nevertheless, the strongest reason to believe, that when, by the establishment of a general government, the clandestine importa - tion of foreign articles shall be prevented, and that preference given throughout the United States to the manufactures of America, which the common interest demands, our established manufactures will resume their former vigor, and others be found to flourish which have hitherto been little known among us. "In all of these movements for patronizing home industry," says the author, "for the adoption of a federal constitution, and for the enact - ment of a national tariff, the journeymen were united with the masters. In fact, as our analysis has shown, both masters and journeymen were practically on the common level of the custom-order and retail-shop stages of industry. The wholesale-order stage was just beginning. The employer was not yet a capitalist, and the notion of interest and profit on capital had as yet little or no place in industry. A 'manufacturer' was literally a 'hand worker,' functioning indeed as merchant, but not as capitalist. Thus, protection of the manufacturer was identical with protection of the wage-earner." Manufacturers and employees alike in the early years of the republic faced a formidable undertaking. They had secured the desired protec - tionist policy from Congress. Their ambition was also "to introduce col - lectively better methods of production." They knew that in every possible way they would be resisted by the Government and manufac turers of Great Britain. The British Parliament had prohibited the exportation of tools and machinery, and even as late as 1804 cotton machinery could be smuggled out from England only by marking it as hardware. As is well known, Samuel Slater brought "in his brain" to this country the first models for cotton mill machinery, as the shipment of models or drawings from Great Britain was a penal offense. Thus contemporaneously with the enactment of the first national protective tariff, the manufacturers and employees of this counrty, working jointly, sought resolutely the means of improving the methods of their industries and the quality of their products. For example, the Association of Mechanics and Manufacturers of Providence was founded in Rhode Island in 1789 "for the purpose of promoting industry and giving a just encouragement to ingenuity." This was also the purpose of the Association of Mechanics in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The progressive spirit and honorable purpose of these early trade organizations appeared further in a general movement for the education of apprentices, the founding of libraries and </seg>
            <seg id="p027">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 27 the encouragement of schools. It is significant that in these organiza - tions, while our industrial army was almost entirely of native birth, both employers and employees were represented. One purpose of these so - cieties was "to assist young mechanics with loans." Every one of these young men cherished the ambition to become some day a master of his own shop or factory. But necessarily, as industry grew in magnitude, these ideal condi - tions could not persist. The author states the conviction that it was not the lack of opportunity to become independent producers that actuated mechanics to form trade unions of their own. "On the contrary, it seems that their only motive for organizing was to protect their standard of life as skilled mechanics. Those whose chance of setting up in business for themselves was best were the first to organize into unions. Thus the early unions were composed exclusively of skilled workers, like printers, shoemakers, tailors, carpenters, and so on. Some of these even ex - cluded the less proficient of their trade. In 1809 'all the best workmen' were members of the New York Cordwainers Society, while the Pitts - burgh shoemakers in 1814 excluded from membership those who worked •on 'coarse shoes.' On the other hand, no traces of organization can be found among the unskilled, especially the cotton mill operatives who numbered 100,000 in 1815. This is explained by the fact that the wages of the unskilled were going up, while those of the skilled were kept down by the merchant capitalist. In 1784 common laborers were paid less than $4 a week, while in 1810 they were receiving close to $7 or $8 per week. At the same time the wages of skilled workers remained stationary or actually declined, although the cost of living was con - stantly mounting. It was the desire to resist this pressure upon their standard of life that actuated the skilled workers to band themselves together." There were, of course, many men in the cotton manufacturing in - dustry who could properly claim to rank with skilled workmen, but undoubtedly many of the women and younger workers were nearer the class of unskilled. Shoemakers of Philadelphia and printers of New York were pioneers in labor organization in this country. Carpenters followed. It was the carpenters of Philadelphia who went out on the first recorded ten-hour strike in this country in 1791. They lost their case and then organized as a co-operative society and advertised their work at a sum 25% below the prices established by the master car - penters. All workmen then labored from "sun to sun." The "closed shop" is a phrase of supposedly recent origin, but the thing which it described was sought by the cordwainers of Philadelphia as far back as 1794. They sought to compel their employers to retain none but union men in their shops and to prevent non-union men from securing employment. New York cordwainers imposed a heavy fine on all newcomers who failed to join their organization. Non-union men were followed by economic and social ostracism — though the "boycot - ting" of their handiwork had not yet been Introduced. The early "closed </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT shop" movement was denounced as a lawless conspiracy and was a lively subject of litigation in the courts. Historically it is well remembered how the embargo and non - intercourse acts of the first decade of the nineteenth century, followed by the second war with England in 1812, brought prosperity to the young manufacturing industries of America. But when the second war for independence ceased in 1815, vast imports of British and other foreign wares were poured into the American market. "These enormous importations which burdened the warehouses of the merchants and soon after fell greatly in price, were fraught with the most disastrous conse - quences. Many were compelled to close their factories in which their whole capitals were invested. Many others, who ventured to continue, became hopelessly bankrupt in the end." Thirty branches of industry in Philadelphia which in 1816 employed 9,672 workmen had discharged 7,500 of them by 1819. According to Niles' Register, there were in that year 20,000 persons daily seeking work in Philadelphia. There were an equal number in New York and about 10,000 in Baltimore. One after another the newly established trade and labor unions suc - cumbed. Excessive imports had dealt as heavy a blow to them as to their employers. After 1820 industrial conditions improved in America under a more adequate system of protective tariff duties, and labor union end trade union movements revived under the impetus of fuller employment. Wages advanced; there developed a demand for shorter hours of labor. In 1822 the German millwrights and machine workers of Philadelphia formally resolved that ten hours of labor were enough, "and that work ought to begin at 6 A. M. and end at 6 P. M., with an hour for breakfast and one for dinner." The Boston house carpenters struck in 1820 for a ten-hour day. Their employers bitterly opposed the movement. "We fear and dread the consequences," they said, "of such a measure upon the morals and well-being of society," "especially in our city, the early rising and in - dustry of whose inhabitants are universally proverbial." To this the con - tractors for new buildings joined, and resolved that the movement was "a departure from the salutary and steady usages which have prevailed in this city and all New England, from time immemorial." Public opinion seemed to be against the carpenters; their movement failed. Part II. "Citizenship" (1827-1833), is written by Helen L. Sumner. The first co-ordinated movement of several trades in the United States was organized in Philadelphia in 1827 — the Mechanics' Union of Trade Associations, which in turn gave birth to the first working men's party in America or the world, and to the first industrial union in this country, the New England Association of Farmers, Mechanics and other Work - ingmen. For some years these bodies were an important political force. Labor conditions then were far different from those of the present. James Montgomery, superintendent of the York factories in Saco, Maine, is reported in 1839 as declaring that the day's work at Lowell varied </seg>
            <seg id="p029">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 29 from 11 hours and 24 minutes in December and January to 13 hours and 31 minutes in April, the average for the year being 12 hours and 13 minutes per day, or about 73% hours per week. "In the Middle and Southern States," Mr. Montgomery said, "the average working day was even higher, being about 13% hours per day, equivalent to 82% hours per week in summer and about 75% hours per week throughout the year. In 1831 in the New England and Middle States 58% of all the employees of cotton mills, including hand weavers, were women. In 1833 the fac - tories of Lowell are said to have employed only 1,200 male workers and 3,800 female workers, and in 1834, 4,500 female workers out of a total of 6,000 operatives. Those were the days when most of the factory employees at Lowell and elsewhere were the native-born sons and daughters of New England, though British-born were gradually coming in It should be remembered that in the early years of the nineteenth century non-property owning citizens were not allowed to exercise the franchise, though they were given this by Massachusetts in 1820 and by New York in 1822. Imprisonment for debt was common. The Boston Prison Discipline Society estimated that about 75,000 persons were an - nually thus imprisoned in the United States, and the laboring classes were particularly wroth against the militia system which granted ex - emption from compulsory training to those who could afford to pay cer - tain fines. This compulsory military service rendered, however, for only a day or a few days each year, was a remembered teaching of President Washington, but the purchase of exemption was a manifest abuse of a sound principle. The injustice of which the working men most earnestly complained was the lack of a complete, free, public educational system, for which, however, notable beginnings had been made in Massa - chusetts and generally in New England. The American labor movement on an important scale made its first appearance in 1827 at Philadelphia, where the first labor paper of which any numbers have been preserved, the "Mechanics' Free Press," was published. Carpenters and other workers of Philadelphia advocated a ten-hour day and to enforce it formed the Mechanics' Union of Trade Associations. In the year following the Mechanics' Union frankly went into politics to secure representation in the Philadelphia city council and the state legislature. Both of the existing political organizations sought to intrigue for the working men's support. As the author says, "The efforts of the Democratic party, which claimed a sort of proprie - tary interest in the working men, were directed primarily toward splitting the new party Into factions. The Federalists, on the other hand, were continually trying to use the working men's movement to their own advancement." Abolition of imprisonment for debt became the chief demand of organized working men in New York as well as in Pennsylvania. The movement eventually succeeded, and undoubtedly the demands of the workmen gave an impetus to the improvement of the public schools, though in this cause the working men were heartily joined by the </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT manufacturers. Soon, however, as the labor union organizations ad - vanced, there began to be sinister developments. Schemers and agita - tors endeavored to appropriate the workmen's organizations to their own purposes. It is significant that most of these schemers and agita - tors were immigrants from Europe. One of them, in the "Working Man's Advocate" of New York, demanded that "the titles of the present owners to the whole property of each state, real and personal, lands, houses, vessels, goods, and private property of every description, be at once invalidated; that the whole property of the state thus taken from those who now possess it, be put up at national auction; that the total estimated value of the same be divided into as many portions as there are adults in the state, and that one portion (In value) be credited to each, to which amount he or she shall be allowed to purchase at the state auction." A working man's party in which such radical ideas were rampant contested for a while with Tammany for the control of the City of New York, and broadening out became a factor in the politics of the entire state. The movement for a distinct working men's party spread to New England. Unlike the earlier organizations of wage-earners, this radical movement, largely foreign led, "appears to have been opposed to pro - tection" — a sign that conscious antagonism of this class of workers toward their employers was deepening. Very familiar seems the lamen - tation of the New England Association of Farmers, Mechanics and other Working Men for "the low estimation in which useful labor is held by many whose station in society enables them to give the tone to public opinion." "All who can do so resort to some means of living without hard work, the learned professions are crowded, and combinations are formed by tlftt portion of society who have money and leisure, or who live by their wits, to increase and maintain their own relative im - portance, whilst the more industrious and useful portion of the com - munity, who are too intent upon their daily occupation to form com - binations for mutual advantage, or to guard against the devices of their better informed or more enterprising neighbors, are reduced to con - stant toil, stripped of the better share of their earnings, holding a sub - ordinate, if not degraded situation in society .and frequently despised by the very men, and women and children, who live at ease upon the fruits of their labor." To this New England association factory employees were admitted. They had not been included in the early organizations in New York and Philadelphia. Yet the factory employees were far from enthusiastic over the cause or the methods of the New England association, and at a convention at New Haven in 1833, where the operatives had refused to be represented, it was openly declared that these employees "are already sold to the oppressor; they have felt the chains riveted upon themselves and their children, and despair of redemption." This working men's movement in New England aroused attention for a time, but in the end proved a lamentable failure. It had some strange </seg>
            <seg id="p031">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 31 leaders. Thus "the mechanics, artisans and other working men of Bos - ton nominated for Congress William Foster, son of a prominent Boston merchant and slaveholder, who had lived in France and was said to have been president of a Jacobine club during the French Revolution." Such an individual could not have been a very representative New England working man, and the hard-headed Yankee wage-earners appraised the movement at its real worth. It never developed much real strength and was soon ended. Part III deals with "Trade Unionism" (1833-1839), and is written by Edward B. Mittelman. He traces the history of the local trade unions that began to develop after 1833 and the first organizations of working women. Seamstresses, tailoresses, shoe binders and book binders were the most active pioneers in this movement. It was stated that in 1836 seamstresses had average earnings of only $1.25 a week, or of less than one-half of what young women were receiving in textile factories. The trades unions of this period earnestly resolved to keep out of party politics and adhered to immediate demands for improved wages and shorter hours. The trades unions of New York began to gain promi - nence with a strike of the German carpenters in the spring of 1833. These men had been working for $1.37% a day and asked $1.50. The Typographical Society took up their cause, and German mechanics of all trades were urged to give 25 cents a week for the assistance of the carpenters, who finally won their demand of $1.50 for a day of ten hours during the spring and summer. For a while trades unions increased and flourished in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Between 1833 and 1837 inclusive, 173 strikes were reported. The year 1835 brought a general demand for a ten-hour working day instead of the day from sunrise to sunset that had been the practice. Employers op - posed the movement on the ground that a reduction in the number of hours would lessen the amount of labor performed. Most of these strikes were not characterized by serious violence. This sinister phase of the labor movement appears to have been due to immigration. But the progress of labor organization met a grave check in the panic of 1837. The first national trades union organized in August, 1834, dis - appeared in May, 1837, in the face of hard times and precarious employ - ment. American-born workmen were at this time still dominant in union affairs, and it is significant that the national trades union clearly endorsed the principle of a protective tariff. "With the first descent of the panic in 1837," says this author, "the labor movement was crushed out of existence. The local societies, the city assemblies, the national federation of assemblies and locals and the nation trade unions disappeared. With them went their official organs, the newspapers they had started for purposes of agitation and for carry - ing news of interest to their members." Wages were everywhere re - duced and thousands of workers lost their employment. "The streets of New Bedford," said one report, "are now thronged with seamen out of </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT employment. Forty whaleships are lying at the wharves, but nothing doing to fit them out for sea." A report from Haverhill, Mass., an - nounced "the almost entire failure of the shoe business in this vicinity." Many of the hardships of the workers were now attributed to immigra - tion, and the author states that the rank and file of the newly formed native American party were "the suffering working classes smarting under the effects of competition led by office-seekers whose occupation had been encroached upon by adopted citizens." During the fifty-five years from 1790-1845 only a little more than 1,000,000 alien immigrants had come to American. But in the ten years from 1845-1855 the immi - gration was approximately 3,000,000. What made conditions most diffi - cult was that "a large proportion of these immigrants remained in the cities of the seaboard." In the years between 1840 and 1860 the labor movement in the United States centered largely on an effort to secure a shortening of the hours of work. Here and there individual manufacturers had voluntarily re - duced the hours of labor in their establishments, and humanitarian sup - port of the ten-hour cause became more and more powerful. In 1845 in Massachusetts when the hours in factories were found to range from 11 hours and 24 minutes in January and December to 13 hours and 31 min - utes in March, the legislature gave lively attention to the subject, but finally concluded to take no action, on the ground that the industry would be driven to other states where longer hours were permitted; second, that a reduction of hours must result in a reduction oi wages; and finally that since "labor is on an equality with capital and indeed controls it, it is intelligent enough to make its own bargains and to look out for its own interests without interference from us." The first state to pass a ten-hour law was New Hampshire in 1847. The law proved defective. While fixing ten hours as a legal day's work, longer days by specific contract were permitted, even in the case of children under fifteen who had the consent of their parents or guardians. Though the working people in many communities pledged themselves not to contract for more than the legal day of ten hours, yet they were persuaded by their employers in many cases to agree on a longer day — and thus the working day in New Hampshire remained about 12 V4 hours in length. Pennsylvania in 1848 enacted a law that no person should be required to work in textile factories "for more than ten hours a day or 60 hours a week." But this shortened day was accom - panied in Pittsburgh, for example, by a 16% reduction in wages. Now, however, both the Whigs and the Democrats in Pennsylvania pledged their support to ten-hour legislation. Maine, following, made ten hours the legal day for all labor except agriculture, unless other hours were expressly stipulated in the contract, and the employment of children under sixteen for more than ten hours a day was prohibited. Between 1850 and 1855 ten-hour laws were passed in Rhode Island, Ohio and Connecticut. The South then as now, sin - gularly reluctant to make any change in working conditions, almost </seg>
            <seg id="p033">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 33 ignored the new movement. Georgia was the only southern state to enact any legislation, and there, in 1853, it was provided that for all white persons under twenty-one years of age, in cotton, woolen and other manufacturing establishments the legal day should be "from sun - rise to sunset, the usual and customary time for meals being allowed." Massachusetts, which has been the pioneer in so much labor legis - lation, hesitated to pass a ten-hour law. In this state there had come a sharp change in the manufacturing personnel. For a long time the factory towns had drawn women and girls from the agricultural districts, but during the hard times that followed 1847, thousands of these women and girls returned to their homes, and when peace revived in 1851-1852 "their places had been filled with Irish immigrants." Yet there was an important voluntary shortening of hours and amelioration of conditions in the Bay State, and factory conditions to a large extent were so favor - able that the growth of unions was discouraged. Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune powerfully championed the cause of labor, but he was an opponent of strikes and an advocate of co-operation. Thus he said of a tailors' strike in Boston: "A scale of prices so established is a stone rolled up in a mountain; the first jar sends it headlong down again. If all the trades in New York could fix their own prices today, leaving our system of labor, wages and trade essentially as they are now, a very few months would serve to sap and subvert the whole." Yet Greeley was a champion of labor organization. "The trade unions may not be always managed in the most judicious manner," he says; "it is not to be expected that they should, and we have often taken occasion to express our decided disagreement with the proceedings of some of them. But in the present general anarchy of labor they are an excellent element." In 1853-1854 nearly all of the trades in the northeastern part of the United States had some sort of a trade union, but again, as before, these unions fell like cardboard at the first shock of hard times — the panic of 1857 putting an end to nearly all of them. Part V of the work is on the theme "Nationalization" (1860-1877), and is written by Dr. John B. Andrews, the secretary of the National Association for Labor Legislation, an able man and an authority on the subject. Dr. Andrews points out that "While the country was en - grossed in Civil War and reconstruction, the American labor movement developed for the first time, almost unnoticed, its characteristic national features. This period witnessed the distinctly American philosophies of greenbackism and the eight-hour day; the rise of the agitation for the exclusion of Oriental labor; the invention of the trade union label; the first national trade agreement; the establishment of the first govern - ment bureau of labor; the organization of the first permanent labor lobby at Washington; the enactment of the first eight-hour legis - lation and the earliest laws against 'conspiracy' and 'intimidation.' The </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT period also saw the organization of the first national employers' associa - tion and the first national labor party." That is to say, this period beheld the development of labor condi - tions and labor controversies as we know them in this present time. This period saw also the development of some strong and notable figures among advocates of the labor cause. One of these as characterized by Dr. Andrews was William H. Sylvis of the molders' union, and another was Jonathan C. Fincher of the machinists and blacksmiths, whose "Flncher's Trade Review," published at Philadelphia, was "perhaps the most influential labor paper of the period — certainly one of the best labor papers ever published in the United States." Strange as it may seem now, the national convention of working men that met in Philadelphia just before the outbreak of the Civil War on February 22, 1861, de - clared in its resolutions for "full and clear recognition of the equal rights of the South in the Territories," and proclaimed that "Our Gov - ernment never can be sustained by bloodshed, but must live in the af - fections of the people; we are utterly opposed to any measures that will evoke civil war." Like so many of the active labor leaders of 1914-1917, these earlier leaders were pronouncedly pacifist — and yet, as Dr. An - drews reminds us — "The war once broken out, the Northern wage-earners abandoned their former opposition and vied with the farmers in fur - nishing volunteers. Entire local unions enlisted at the call of President Lincoln." After the first shock of the war was over, labor organizations again progressed, beginning probably in the second half of 1862. By Novem - ber, 1865, about 60 different trades were organized into several hundred unions — the machinists and the blacksmiths leading in strength, with unions most numerous in Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania. Their basis was the local trades assembly rather than the national trades union. This activity in the trade union movement naturally led to an ag - gressive movement for organization among employers. These organi - zations of employers set themselves to combat the eight-hour movement which was already launched, and to maintain the working day at ten hours. On the workers' side the Knights of St. Crispin in the shoe - makers' trade belonged to this party. So did the Typographical Union among the printers. So did the Sons of Vulcan. Iron moulders, machin - ists, blacksmiths and engineers were now the leaders in labor under - takings. In July, 1865, a national convention was called in the City of New York for the purpose of "devising the most eligible means to secure to the working men eight hours' labor as a legal day's work." Another national labor convention met in Baltimore in 1866. The national spirit had been greatly strengthened by the war, and it was natural that it should have its effect upon labor organizations. In June, 1868, Con - gress enacted an eight-hour law for Government employees. Many of the active labor leaders, as is well known, went into the greenback party of 1874-1877. In 1876 an exceptionally powerful labor organiza- </seg>
            <seg id="p035">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 35 tion was formed by the uniting of the Sons of Vulcan, the Associated Brotherhood of Iron and Steel Heaters and the Iron and Steel Roll Hands under the name of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. It was destined to have a very distinct and successful career. It was in the iron trade that the sliding scale probably was first adopted in 1866 — the earliest national trade agreement in American history. More than most other workers these iron and steel men, whose leaders were largely of native American stock, recognized the close, mutual interest of employers and employees, and they were historically long strong advocates of the American protective system. Dr. Andrews traces very clearly and fairly the development of sinister and violent factors in the labor movement in the later seventies — the Molly Maguires of the anthracite region and the destructive rail - roads strikes of 1877 which called for the aggressive action of the United States Government — the first time in the history of American labor movement that the Federal troops had been called out to suppress strikes in time of peace. "The courts began to change their attitude toward labor unions," writes Dr. Andrews; "the strikes and riots brought back from oblivion the doctrine of malicious conspiracy as applied to labor combinations. The legislatures of many states enacted conspiracy laws directed against labor. But the strongest moral effect was upon the wage-earning labor class. The spirit of labor solidarity was strengthened and made national The feeling of resentment en - gendered thereby began to assume a political aspect, and during the next two years the territory covered by the strike wave became a most promising field for labor parties of all kinds and descriptions." Next in order in the work is Part VI, "Upheaval and Reorganiza - tion" (since 1876), by Selig Perlman. The earlier years of this period witnessed the rise of the Knights of Labor as the dominant force in labor organization. This secret order had been formed in 1869 by Uriah Smith Stephens, a native American educated for the Baptist ministry, but compelled to learn the tailoring trade for a livelihood. He had also been a schoolmaster and had traveled in Europe. The secret ritual of the order as written by Stephens proclaimed that "Open and public association having failed after a struggle of centuries to protect or ad - vance the interest of labor, we have lawfully constituted this assembly," and "in using this power of organized effort and co-operation we but imitate the example of capital heretofore set in numberless instances." It was added, however, that "We mean no conflict with legitimate enterprise, no antagonism to necessary capital." "We mean to create a healthy public opinion on the subject of labor (the only creator ot values or capital), and the justice of irsteceiving a full, just share of the values or capital it has created." After 1873 the Knights of Labor extended their organization grad - ually throughout the United States, taking over many of the previously existing trade unions, but organizing new unions of their own. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT This period' since 1876 witnessed also a noteworthy growth of so - cialism in America, a cause which had been favored earlier by many of the German immigrants in 1848. The International Working Men's Association was the form taken by the socialist propaganda after 1876. Most of the leading advocates of this movement, though not all, were foreigners of a radical type. Most of the strength acquired by the movement was among non-English speaking wage-earners. An attempt to combine the greenback and the labor movement characterized the years between 1876 and 1880. These were years of turmoil in politics. More and more, leaders of extreme views began to gain ground in labor organization. More and more the control of this movement in its more aggressive expressions passed over to foreigners. Thus the Illinois Labor Bureau in 1886 stated that of the members of the trade unions of that State only 21 per cent were American, 33 per cent German, 19 per cent Irish, 10 per cent British other than Irish, and 12 per ceiit Scandinavian, with Poles, Bohemians and Italians constituting the re - mainder. This was not at all surprising, for the old apprentice system had been well-nigh abandoned, and, therefore, necessarily the United States had been drawing most of its supply of skilled labor from abroad. The great activity of the Knights of Labor as a national organization began in 1880, by which time the order had acquired a formidable strength and numbers in the industrial communities. Terence V. Pow - derly, an active member of the Machinists' and Blacksmiths' Union, who had been elected Mayor of Scranton, Pa., on a labor ticket in 1878, be - came the head of the Knights of Labor. The general assembly of this order favored persistent strikes as the best method of advancing the interests of the wage-earners — the most notable strike of the period be - ing that of the telegraphers in 1883. This, like most other of the Knights of Labor strikes, was a failure, for these reasons, as the author de - scribes them — "First, the order operated mainly among the unorganized and the unskilled, an element which had no previous experience in the management of strikes and could easily be replaced by strike-breakers; second, the form of organization of the Knights, well adapted as it was to strikes on a large scale and to extensive boycotts, displayed an in - herent weakness when it came to a strike of the members of a single trade against their employers. Such a strike soon became a test of or - ganization and discipline, qualities which a mixed organization like the district assembly of the Knights could not hope to possess in the same degree as a national trade union." Between 1880 and 1890, a huge immigration was filling up the labor market. On the other hand, "settlers were moving into the last unoccupied portion of the public domain." Strikes were failing more and more. This period witnessed the development of the boycott as "a new force in hand." Under Powderly as Grand Master Workman, the Knights of Labor grew rapidly in membership. There was something in the order with its far-reaching organization which seemed to dazzle the minds of men. Powderly himself became such a national figure as </seg>
            <seg id="p037">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 37 had no labor leader before him. He drew immense audiences wherever he spoke. Newspapers gave wide currency to all his words. In the State of Arkansas the legislature gave him the privilege of the House of Representatives to deliver a labor speech. The Knights of Labor took up a strong cause when they led the agitation for prohibiting the immigration of alien contract labor, and one additional prestige was the defeat of Jay Gould in the Wabash strike of 1885. In 1886 the Knights of Labor numbered 5,892 assemblies of a total membership of 702,924. Meanwhile the black international or anarchistic movement in the Middle West had been preparing trouble for the more conservative labor movement in America. On May 3, 1886, in Chicago, the international movement culminated in the bomb massacre of Haymarket Square. Samuel Gompers testified that "The effect of that bomb was that it not only killed a policeman, but it killed our eight-hour movement for that year and for a few years afterward, notwithstanding we had absolutely no connection with these people." The Knights of Labor themselves in turn were now disintegrating, the membership of the order falling from over 700,000 members in 1886 to 510,000 in 1887. The growth of the Knights of Labor had aroused em - ployers to form strong organizations of their own. Many strikes now followed, and in the words of the author, "After 1887 the Knights of Labor lost their hold upon the large cities with their wage-conscious and largely foreign population, and became an organization predominantly of country people, of mechanics, small merchants and farmers, an ele - ment more or less purely American and decidedly middle-class in its philosophy. This change serves more than anything else to account for the subsequent close affiliation between the order and the 'Farmers' Alliance,' as well as for the whole-hearted support which it gave to the people's party." The policy of the Knights of Labor had favored co-operation, and co-operation wherever attempted has usually proved disappointing. Labor men themselves were not successful in these business under - takings. They seemed to lack not merely capital, but practical business sense, as well in merchandising as in manufacture. "The failure was definite and final," the author says. "Not since this time has the Ameri - can labor movement ventured upon co-operation. The year 1888 marks the closing of the age of middle-class 'panaceas' and consequently the beginning of the wage-conscious period." The work describes further the struggles of the socialists in the United States to become a political force, and Henry George's dramatic political movement in New York City and State. Through this time the American Federation of Labor was gaining in force and the Knights of Labor were declining. The general officers of the pattern-makers, foundrymen, blacksmiths, machinists and boiler-makers in leaving the Knights of Labor declared in May, 1888, that "The odium which the order has gained is damaging to us. We will have to cut loose from </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT the Knights of Labor before the employers will meet us or respect us in any way." Thus gradually year after year the unions of the skilled and semi-skilled trades which had their origin in the Knights of Labor went over to the Federation, "converting the latter from an organization primarily of skilled men into one more representative in the entire labor movement." Between 1899 and 1904, the membership of the American Federa - tion of Labor increased from 350,000 to 1,676,000. During 1912 and 1913 much prominence was acquired by the Industrial Workers of the World, which had been originally organized by socialists in 1905 as a rival of the American Federation of Labor. It is pointed out by the author of this portion of the work that a great deal has been gained in our own time by the labor movement. "A clear gauge of the growth of popular education on the labor question is given by the McNamara dynamite case. What a difference between the attitude of the public toward this case of extreme and premeditated violence and its attitude towards the suspected Chicago anarchists! In 18S6, bloody revenge and suppression were violently demanded. In 1912 nothing more drastic was heard than a demand for an impartial investigation of the causes of the labor unrest, with a view to the prevention of future conflicts, and scarcely any call for revenge or any disaster to the labor movement as a whole." And again: "The aroused sympathetic interest of the public in the labor question is beginning to produce results also in the field of labor legislation. During the last half dozen years, two-thirds of the states have adopted the principle of workmen's compensation for all industrial accidents, preparing in this manner a fertile ground for the important movement for industrial safety. Other protective regulations have been the prohibition by the federal taxing power of the use of an industrial poison, the provision in several states of one day's rest in seven, the beginning of effective prohibition of night work, of maximum limits upon the length of the working day, and of minimum wage laws for women. This legislation differs from the class legislation demanded by workingmen during preceding periods in that it bases itself entirely upon police power, a power which, as a result of the spreading under - standing of the labor problem, and the persistent demand coming from the public as well as from organized labor, has become so broadened in scope that much which, a decade or two ago, would have been ruled out of court as class legislation, has recently been held to be war - ranted under the federal and state constitutions." But it is admitted that: "Since 1900 socialism has been making rapid progress in the labor ranks. In the last four years it has suc - ceeded in gaining the support of the important unions of the miners and the machinists. It now commands about one-third of the votes at the annual conventions of the Federation, coming, to a large extent, from the 'industrial unions,' and it has reached a million votes at na - tional elections. The old-time struggle between the rival ideas of politi - cal and economic socialism, which dates back to the time of the </seg>
            <seg id="p039">STATE DEPARTMENT OP LABOR 39 Lassallean movement and the International, in some measure finds a modern counterpart in the rivalry between the political socialists and the syndicalist movement. "Socialism has acquired a considerable following also among the native-born educated classes, and has gained some noted converts among the rising class of American 'publicists,' which, in certain respects, en - ables it to exercise an influence in the community, which is not to be measured only by its polling strength. The notable though brief social - ist administrations in Milwaukee and Schenectady have demonstrated that, at last, after nearly sixty years of effort to become acclimatized, there is such a thing as an 'American' socialism." On the other hand, since America herself entered the great war, per - haps since this work was written, political socialism in this country has suffered a tremendous setback through the suspected and acknowledged hostility of a large part of the socialist element to the government and to the national cause in the struggle against autocratic Germany. It was only the other day that the newspapers chronicled the withdrawal from the socialist party of the man who had recently been its candidate for President of the United States. Mr. Benson, a native American and, therefore, conspicuous among the socialist leaders, declared that he could no longer maintain fellowship with elements that were so vio - lently anti-American. </seg>

            <seg id="p041">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 41 STRIKES In 1917 the Building and Trades Unions of Omaha went on strike for an increase in wages. The trouble was begun by the action of the electrical workers in making a demand for higher wages. The strike spread rapidly to all the building trades. The hearing before the Board of Mediation follows. It is a complete resume of the entire strike. State of Nebraska DEPARTMENT OF LABOR KEITH NEVILLE, Governor G. E. NORMAN, Chief Deputy Labor Commissioner June 18 to August 1, 1917 Board Members ROBERT COWELL, Chairman, Omaha T. P. REYNOLDS, Omaha A. J. SAWYER, Lincoln G. E. NORMAN, Secretary, Lincoln State Capitol Lincoln, Nebraska August 1, 1917. To His Excellency, Keith Neville, Governor of the State of Nebraska: On June 12th, agreeable to a communication from your excellency, of which the following is an excerpt, — "I now deem it advisable for the Board of Mediation and In - vestigation to interest themselves in the labor difficulty in Omaha. You will kindly communicate with the other members of the com - mission and take such steps as are necessary to properly conduct an investigation." Arrangements were made as soon as convenient, members notified and the board met on June 18, 1917, in the Board of Education Rooms in the City Hall of Omaha. All members were present. For the employers, there appeared F. A. Brogan, Esq., and for the labor unions, A. H. Bigelow, Esq. The Chairman stated why the meet - ing was called, by what authority, its duties and its powers; read from the act creating the board, which was signed by Governor Morehead on April 21, 1913. The Chairman then urged a truce upon the basis of conditions as they existed before the trouble started, and read to the parties present an excerpt from Secretary of Labor Wilson's address made in May of this year: "I do not believe that any working man has any right to Inter - fere with capital in organizing into corporations. I do not believe that any capitalist has any right to interfere with working men in organization into unions. If workmen are free, as capital is free to organize, and their standards of living are maintained, then it would seem to be the heights of disloyalty to atop the wheels of Industry in this critical period solely for the purpose of forcing a recognition of the union. And that is one of the things that must be impressed upon employer and employee alike. That 1b the height of disloyalty to force or bring about a stoppage of our Industries In order to force the establishment of standards that they have not been able to force during normal conditions." </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT Counsel for the employers of labor made a statement as to whom he represented and expressed himself as feeling that there should be some definite statement as to what the actual conditions were before the trouble started. Counsel for labor offered to confer, stated he represented what is known unofficially as the Labor Defense League, and stated further that they expected and would desire an investigation of what is known as the Business Men's Association. The Chairman stated he is a member of the Business Men's Association and if either of the parties to the controversy felt there was any impropriety in his sitting on the board, he would resign. No objection was raised by counsel on either side, it being pointed out that statute contemplated a representative of employers and that in like manner Mr. Reynolds represented labor. Upon suggestion of Chairman of the board would like to see all construction work in Omaha resumed on some equitable basis, pending the result of this investigation. Mr. Brogan for employers stated that they were ready to meet any employee, but would not be driven into recognition of the union. Mr. Bigelow expressed a willingness to meet through committees for considering temporary resumption, with a specific agreement that such a meeting would not be considered a recog - nition of unions. Mr. Brogan refused. National Commissioner of Con - ciliation. L. F. Nelson, desired to address the board. Mr. Brogan objected to his doing so at that time. In the hope that a truce might be established, members of the board met during recess with attorneys in a room in the Fontanelle Hotel. Impossible to arrive at any agree - ment because attorney for employers refused to confer with any com - mittee, but stated as he had done previously, that the employers would be glad to meet any employee individually. Board met again at 2:00 p. m., and Mr. Nelson made his statement at that time. He said he had been in Omaha since May 30th urging conciliation and in his address made a very strong plea for settlement, on the basis of Secretary of Labor Wilson's recommendation as to labor troubles during war, quoted above. Board adjourned until June 19th at 10:00 a. m. Upon coming to order, Mr. Brogan referred to the restraining order which was to be heard in the District Court on June 27th acd urged a stoppage of the hearing until after that date. Mr. Bigelow earnestly - argued that the investigation should proceed. Mr. Brogan stated issue was open or closed shop and that as the restraining order — "Decreed that the questions of union or non-union shops, whether advocated for or against by any of the defendants herein, be held in abeyance until the close of the present war, in which the United States Government is now engaged." — hearing should not go on. He, Brogan, had doubts as to whether they were not actually for - bidden from coming before the board by that clause. Mr. Bigelow took a different view and stated labor had absolutely conformed to the spirit of the restraining order for some time, particularly declaring that the </seg>
            <seg id="p043">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 43 unions were not asking for any more of a closed shop than existed before the war. Chairman decided that the board should proceed unless instructed otherwise by the Governor. Mr. Brogan then asked for time for consultation with his clients and the board adjourned until 1:30 p. m. Upon convening Mr. Brogan stated they would decline to participate in the hearing further, until after the hearing in the District Court. Mr. Gaines, acting with Mr. Brogan, for the employers, then appeared for the first time. At the same time M. D. Owen and B. F. Ninde appeared with Mr. Bigelow, the former two gentlemen representing the Bricklayers International Union. He also urged the board should take a recess until after the hearing referred to. Chairman made a statement that he had a call from the Attorney General who claimed to speak with authority for the Governor and that he, too, had requested an adjournment. Acting upon the Attor - ney General's request, the Chairman announced adjournment subject to instructions from the Governor or call of the chair. Mr. Bigelow raised the question that a vote of the members should be taken on that action. The correctness of this position was recognized by the Chairman and the Secretary called the roll. Immediately there was a discussion as to whether the Secretary had a vote. Chairman thought he did not have, but after argument and a statement of Judge Sawyer, a member of the Board, expressing his idea that under the law the Secretary was entitled to a vote, Chairman ruled that the Secre - tary's vote should be recorded. Adjourned until Wednesday, June 20th, at 2:00 p. m. Chairman reported conversation with Governor and stated that the Governor had informed him that the Attorney General did not represent his views and that the matter of adjournment or continuation would be left to the Board, whom he felt were better informed as to the situation than he could possibly be. Mr. Gaines again urged adjournment and he was followed by Judge Duncan Vinsonhaler, who stated that he represented Attorney General Reed, who also asked adjournment until after the hearing on injunction, stating that an investigation by the Board would greatly embarrass the Attorney General in his injunction writ then pending. Some suggestion was made by Judge Vinsonhaler that there were hopeful signs that the difficulties between employers and employees were in a fair way to be settled. Upon motion of Mr. Reynolds, the Board then decided to adjourn until Friday morning at 10:00 o'clock and not have a hearing on Thurs - day, hoping that in the meantime an effort would be made by both sides to adjust differences along the line suggestion by the injunction, viz., dropping all question of union or non-union shop until the close of the war. Board met at the usual place Friday, June 22nd, at 10:00 a. m. Chairman announced that on the previous evening he had been served with an order restraining the Board from holding any meetings until a hearing on an application for a temporary injunction, a petition against </seg>
            <seg id="p044">44 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT the Board having been filed in a quo warranto suit by the Attorney General, and the Chairman then referred to reported criticisms of the Board by the Attorney General, wherein he had questioned the loyalty of the members of the Board, and the Chairman made an appeal to a large gathering of working men present to refrain from doing anything which might add to the difficulty or tenseness of the situation. Mr. Bigelow suggested asking court to advance hearing on the restraining order and if possible have the matter passed upon im - mediately. Judge Sawyer then introduced the following resolution, which was unanimously passed: "Whereas, the right of this Board to sit as a Board of Mediation or Investigation has been challenged by the Attorney General on a quo warranto proceeding to test the constitutionality of the Board; therefore, be it resolved, that the court before whom this case is pending be, and is hereby, respectfully requested to set the hearing of the case at as early a date as possible." Meeting then adjourned subject to call of Chairman. You have al - ready been furnished with a report of the proceedings before Judge Chas. Leslie on June 26th and 27th, together with his opinion and denial of temporary injunction writ against the Board. As counsel for the restraining order there appeared with the Attor ney General, Senator Norris Brown and Judge Vinsonhaler. The Hon. A. F. Mullen appeared for the Board, and Mr. Bigelow as representing one member of the Board. All this seems necessary so that your Excellency and the people of the state may understand causes of delay and reasons for the protracted hearing. From the testimony taken in the hearings when the Board resumed its sittings after the refusal of an injunction against them it develops that the first trouble arose with the Electrical Workers. About January 1st they notified contractors that after April 1st they desired a raise in wages to 68% cents per hour. At that time wages were 57% cents. During the three months intervening repeated efforts were made to secure a conference. On March 30th one was obtained, and the work - ers were offered 62% cents per hour. The following day this was modified and formal notification given that after April 1st they would pay 60 cents per hour and an intimation was given that there would be no discussion. On Monday, April 2nd, because of a refusal to confer, the Electrical Workers quit work. On Tuesday, April 3rd, Chairman of the Contractors' Association told the men the whole matter had been turned over to the Business Men's Association. A committee from the workers then called on Alvin Johnson, Secretary of the Business Men's Association, who informed the committee that the employers or the Business Men's Association would not meet with representatives of local or international unions. Several days later, it is stated, that there was trouble on several construction jobs, electrical workers' union officials disclaim any knowl- </seg>
            <seg id="p045">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 45 edge or responsibility for these conflicts and testimony was given that such conflicts were contrary to advice and admonition. Because of the reported conflicts and alleged danger and menace to life and property, employers asked for and obtained a temporary injunction against the Electrical Workers. A large number of witnesses who are members of the Electrical Workers Union appeared before the Board and testified that their reason for demanding increased wage was because of the increased cost of living. They testified also that in former years employers had conferred with them and that because of their refusal to do so this year and their further refusal to grant them an increased wage rate they quit work. Testimony was also given that witnesses had made clear in the hearing for the injunction against the Electrical Workers that the granting of such a writ would precipitate further trouble as the members of many of the unions would be pre - cluded from accepting employment on any work covered by an injunc - tion writ, which by its terms prevented the maintenance of union principles. It might be proper here to call your Excellency's attention to the fact that the judge in his opinion referred to the meager evidence offered in the application for the injunction and that the showing made was sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to a temporary injunction. While the wages asked for by Electrical Workers seem somewhat high, and evidently their application was so regarded by the employers, testimony was given which demonstrated that on an average they were not em - ployed more than eight months in a year and that it took some four years of close application, at meager pay, to learn the trade and that they had to expend a considerable sum of money for tools. A large number of the unions in other crafts had also presented claims for increased wages and so forth, and in the majority of instances had asked that their claims should be granted at about the same time as the Electrical Workers, to-wit, April 1st. The hoisting engineers had requested an advance to take effect on May 1st. Employers offered a compromise to take effect May 1st. Employees asked for conference as in past years. This was refused with the statement that rhe matter was in the hands of the Business Men's Association. It developed that hoisting engineers do not work on an average more than seven months in any one year; that considerable training is necessary, that the em - ployment is risky, that they are required to have a license, and that the men have to pass an examination before admittance to the union. All this for the purpose of safeguarding the lives of the workers and such other workers as may be employed on the same building. Evidence showed that many employers were anxious to confer, but were pre - vented from doing so by the Business Men's Association, who did not approve of employers meeting with committees. This union is prac - tically organized up to one hundred per cent. Some employers gave the advance asked for. Some of them paid the advance, but covered it up. Many of these men have since left the city. This due to the effect that </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT all work stopped because of the closing of material yards on or about May 1st. ; *iV It is suggested that the employees and union men generally had a concerted plan to make Omaha a closed shop town, and evidence was given that the employers had stated that they would insist on an open shop and that conference would be useless as they never would consent to the closed shop. The unions, however, deny having any concerted plan for forcing a closed shop in all the trades, and the evidence shows that demand for any new or additional recognition was made in not more than three or four unions, and other unions asked only the same recognition that they had enjoyed in previous years. All the unions making such new demands have now withdrawn them, and as to the issue of the open or closed, or union and non-union shop, the unions now unite in an offer to waive during war time all demands for any new additional recognition, if their unions will be accorded the same recognition given to them by employers before this season. There appeared before the Board a large number of witnesses who were members of the Teamsters' Union. This union was organized in 1916. They never had a closed shop. They made demand for a closed shop in the spring of 1917. Wages in this particular craft varied greatly, some were paid a weekly wage ranging from $12.00 per week to $20.00 per week, others a monthly wage ranging from - $40.00 to $75.00 per month and still one other group who received $9.00 per week and their board. Practically all of these men have to attend to their teams on Sundays and the majority of them have to live far removed from their place of employment. There were still others who were paid upon a commission or ton - nage basis, receiving in some instances half of what they and their team would earn, figured on that basis. There were other cases where they did not receive quite half, where, for instance, a man and team earned on the tonnage basis $6.50 per day, the man received $3.00, and there was at least one case where the witness testified that he had kept an account of his earnings and the contents of the book in which he kept the record and testimony tends to show that for a considerable period of time his employers kept out of his earnings what would average 48 cents per day and this sum the employers still retain. When the teamsters made their demands in January, they did so without any knowledge of any demands being made by other unions. In several instances they succeeded in getting an advance in wages. Testimony was given that a man employed by C. W. Hull &amp; Co., was president of the Teamsters' Union. This man was discharged about May 15th. According to testimony, the foreman informed him that Mr. Hull required his discharge because he had failed to report some broken tile which came in with a shipment and that because of this he, Hull, could not recover from the railroad company. The witness himself </seg>
            <seg id="p047">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 47 testified that Mr. Hull had told him he was discharged because he had been in the habit of laying off too much, but this the witness denied. Other union employees demanded his reinstatement and because this was refused some 25 quit work, claiming that the discharge was because of being president of their union. It was charged by the Attorney General in his general injunction suit that the employees who quit work attacked men who had been hired by Hull &amp; Co., to act as substitutes, but no evidence as to that has been presented to the Board. In the Attorney General's petition it was further stated that it was no longer safe to operate their teams and wagons, and as a result, material yards, on or about May 21st, closed down all over the city. Evidence on the part of the union, however, oppose this claim and assert that the material yards were closed down by order of the Busi - ness Men's Association as a step in their fight against union labor. The closing down of these material shops and yards caused a general cessation of business and threw out of employment a large number of men. It may interest you and the general public generally to know that a marked improvement seemed to be effected through the organization of the teamsters for after their organization there was a general wage increase in their line of work all over the city. Men in this employment have long hours. Many of them are required to be at the yards at six or six-thirty in the morning, are allowed one hour for dinner and rarely finish before six-thirty at night. They are also required to go to the barns every Sunday, attend to their horses and clean their harness, and failure to do so entails a fine of from seventy-five cents to a day's wages. These long hours seem to be in conflict with state law and should be investigated. The situation as far as the teamsters is concerned is very unfortu - nate. Most of the men are poor with large families and a very largr number of them are still out of employment. Overtures have been made by some employers, the men have been offered all that they ask, but when they were ready to go to work a demand was made that they should sign an open shop application. This they refused to do, claim - ing that it was a violation on the part of the employer of the terms of the injunction and also contrary to union principles. Among the crafts appearing before the Board was the mill workers. It appears they had no union prior to 1916. In the spring they made three demands upon their employers for recognition, a nine-hour day and a minimum scale of 35 cents per hour. The members of the Board were astonished to find that prior to the formation of the union the wages ranged from 20 cents per hour to 30 cents per hour. A very small percentage receiving the latter wage. The employment is said to be hazardous inasmuch as the men work constantly among machin - ery. The work is also unhealthy and objectionable because the air is usually charged with fine dust which they cannot help but Inhale. Tools cost from two to three hundred dollar*, which they are expected </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT to furnish. The nine-hour day and some concessions were made as a wage scale, but they were not fully granted. The employees, since this hearing began, have agreed, in concert with other unions, to waive the recognition during war, but the employers absolutely refused to recog - nize the union. Much testimony was given indicating that the employers were controlled by the Business Men's Association and prevented from making terms with their men by the association. The carpenters made a contract with their employers on April 5th, 1916, for three years, covering wages and other matters. Under the contract they were not to enter into a sympathetic strike. When the mill workers' demands were not acceded to, the carpen - ters threatened to strike and later served notice that if injunction against striking electricians was not dissolved, would enforce a rule under which they would not work on any building where there was an injunction in force as the effect of the injunction would prevent enforce - ment of union principles. Carpenters claim employers knew that men would be compelled to quit work if such an injunction was procured. They also stated that the refusal of mill owners to meet with their employees made it impossi - ble for them to continue in employment, the mill workers belonging to same national union. A large number of carpenters continued at work and are, we under - stand, still working on all jobs they consider fair, but a considerable number have left the city. Plasterers struck because a conference was refused. Later made a compromise agreement. Worked until about May 18th, when it Is claimed employers told them that they had received orders from the Business Men's Association not to pay scale. Later some employers tried to induce plasterers to sign shop agreements. Many of this craft also quit work when the material shops closed down. Cement finishers had no grievance, but were locked out due to failure to get materials on May 21st. Painters made certain demands early in the year. Some were said by employers to be very unreasonable, as, for instance, the demand for a five-inch brush. The union men claimed, however, this was a part of their working rules for some years. Painters also insisted that there should be no employment of what is known as a pacemaker. Their claim being that some employers were in the habit of employing a man at big wages to work a short period of time on a rush plan to set a pace which men could not keep up. Practically all of the differences between the painters and employers have been removed and a large number of the men are at work. The differences between the boiler makers and their employers have been adjusted and the men went back to work on June 25th. The laborers and hod carriers lost employment through the lockout. The iron workers have long been thoroughly organized. They entered into an agreement on May 1st, 1916, which was virtually an </seg>
            <seg id="p049">STATE DEPARTMENT OP LABOR 49 open shop agreement. No member to quit work because of employment of non-union men unless instructed to do so from Indianapolis. Early in the year they made certain demands, among which was that for an increase of wages. This was granted so they did not press their other demands. A slight controversy arose later and their representatives were then informed that there could be no conference or agreement because of the general lockout the majority of these men also were thrown out of employment. Tile workers lost employment due to lockout, but resumed work, but have declined to work on jobs covered by injunction. The bricklayers had no controversy. This craft is thoroughly organized. Many of the men were thrown out of employment because of the closing of the material shops. This craft has had no trouble prior to May 21st since 1915. They cannot strike without consent of their international union, but a number of witnesses testified that they expected to be called out if the temporary injunction is made permanent. Altogether some 14 crafts appeared before us, we examined all told 91 witnesses. The very nature of the investigation or probe made the record of testimony exceedingly voluminous. We had expected that the employers would come before us willingly and were and are very much disappointed that they did not do so. We brought in a number of witnesses through subpoena, but when asked certain questions they refused to answer, acting upon the advice of their attorneys, claiming immunity because the answer might in - criminate in view of the injunction proceedings charging conspiracy in restraint of trade. It was argued that we had power to commit for contempt. For many reasons we were anxious to avoid doing this and so when we came to the end of the testimony of the employees the Chairman by resolution was requested to get Into communication with the Business Men's Association In the hope that through committee or conference some basis might be found for a settlement of the difficulties. In accordance with this resolution the Chairman addressed the following communication to the Association: July 19, 1917. Mr. Alvin Johnson, Sec'y Business Men's Ass'n., Omaha, Nebr. My dear Mr. Johnson: By unanimous resolution of the members of the Board of Media - tion and Investigation I have been requested to communicate with your Association thru you, in the hope that we can find some avenue thru which we can discuss the labor situation as It exists today. It has been my earnest desire from the first, to get some definite expression from both parties to the controversy upon which might be found a basis for a settlement of the difficulties between em - ployers and employees. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT I have had every reason to believe that the Business Men's Association would welcome the fullest investigation and would be glad to aid the Board in getting at all the facts — and this assistance would, I take it, have been given had it not been that you'- Associa - tion (acting upon advice of its attorneys) felt it was precluded from rendering, because of the temporary injunction procured by the Attorney General of the State. It is quite possible that Mr. Reed may have felt that a menace to the peace of the community was imminent and that grave danger from lawlessness threatened our city, and it is quite probable that if the employers had come before us as freely as the employees, some facts may have been brought to our notice, which would have con - vinced our Board that there was abundant justification for his action. Be that is it may, his action made our investigation a one-sided affair, no one has questioned, since the decision in the District Court our authority to summon witnesses and compel attendance. As you are aware, we did succeed in getting witnesses before us, but we found ourselves up against a stone wall, as it were, when witnesses refused to answer questions upon advice of counsel. It has been contended by counsel on the one side that we had power to punish for contempt, a witness who refused to answer, and argued, just as vigorously, by counsel on the other side that we have no such power. Whether such power inheres in our Board or not, we all recognize the right and justice in protecting a witness from giving testimony which might incriminate himself. Furthermore, as a Board and as individuals we are loath to take any steps which might tend to humiliate a witness acting in good faith and following the advice of counsel. Such drastic action, some of us felt, might aggravate the situation further and without doubt cause further delay. Proceeding then as best we could, we have arrived at the end of our examination of employees. While awaiting a transcript of this testimony, preliminary to preparing a report to the Governor of the proceedings thus far, it was felt that this might be an opportune time to offer our services as mediators. Some employers have found a ground upon which to meet their men and many men have returned to work. Other employers have expressed a desire to me personally to have an end of the trouble, but apparently felt they would like the sanction and good will of their fellow or associate employers. A large number of the men are very anxious to go to work (many of them need the wages for the support of their families) and all the men would gladly return if they could without sacrificing such rights or benefits as they feel they enjoy thru their union. From careful investigation and study I am convinced that if the injunction was quashed or removed a large number of men would be ready to return immediately. Strangely enough these are men who have no special grievance themselves — but who are absolutely pre - cluded by a rule of their international association from accepting employment on any building covered by injunction. Whatever reason there may have been for an injunction, I am satisfied none exists today and therefore I feel that if that was re - moved, a large number of men would accept employment at once. Furthermore, I feel warranted in stating that many who have left the city would return. The question of wages and hours is one that I am certain can be settled easily. Many employers have conceded this, and some employers have made overtures to their men and the men responded readily. Unfortunately in some cases they wars then asked to sign </seg>
            <seg id="p051">STATE DEPARTMENT OP LABOR 51 a contract doing away with rights which they seemed to have had prior to the trouble, notably recognition of their union and the prin - ciples of collective bargaining. I have talked to leaders and we have questioned a large number of the employees and they all seem ready to go back upon the con - ditions, regarding these questions, as they existed prior to the start - ing of the trouble. Whatever the attitude of the men may have been, and however exacting or insistent their demands may have been before war was declared — for patriotic or other reasons they are unanimous in declaring that all they want now are such rights as they enjoyed before, no more — no less. Now this is my understanding of the attitude of the employees, and if I am correct, might it not be possible for the employers to grant them that much, and respond in a patriotic and whole-hearted way to the appeal of the Secretary of Labor, and in consonance with suggestions and wishes expressed by the President of the United States? May it not be possible to have a committee of employers meet with us or could the employers agree upon some neutral members of our association to represent them and act for them? This much I am asking as Chairman of the Board — I urge it also as a member of the Business Men's Association, and still more as one who is interested as a citizen and as a business man whose own business is being injured and jeopardized by and thru what seems now to me a somewhat needless controversy. I am assured on all sides that there is no surplus labor. I am convinced also that if the temporary in - junction is made permanent, the trouble will become still more aggravated, and it is because of this belief and owing to this knowledge that I urge the Business Men's Associatoin to sacrifice if needs be a little pride of opinion, if such exists, and any stub - bornness should there be such, so that we may be able, instead of making a partial report, to tell the Governor all the difficulties are ended — the wheels are going 'round again, with business as usual. I have neither submitted this to the Board, to employees, nor their attorneys. It is solely and wholly because of the resolution before referred to, and as a citizen and fellow business man that I make this appeal. For more than thirty years I have been an employer of labor. I have never met with any difficulty in my own business which we could not adjust, and unless employers have some knowledge which has not been communicated to our Board, I cannot see in the situa - tion as it exists now any reason for believing that there are in - superable difficulties which cannot be removed thru discussion, and surmounted, if the proper spirit is shown by both sides. May I not ask and hope for a reply Very respectfully, (Signed) ROBERT CO WELL, Chairman. In response to this letter, the Chairman was invited to a meeting which was held in the Commercial Club rooms on Friday, July 20th. There were some forty or fifty employers and business men present, together with their attorney, Mr. Gaines, who presided over th* meeting. Many of the employers expressed themselves, but smarting under what they seemed to feel was injustice, alleged unreasonable demands and what they claimed were lawless acts on the part of soiie employees, they did not seem to be in a conciliatory attitude. They refused abso - lutely to meet with the committee representing unions, stated that em- </seg>
            <seg id="p052">SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT 52 ployers would meet the men singly, that they could not be expected to restore conditions to what President Wilson would style the status quo ante; that they had employed many men to take the places of those who had quit work, and they would not think of discharging those who had rendered satisfactory service. In other words, they refused to recede from their demand for an open shop, and were unwilling to treat on the basis of the same degree of recognition as obtained before te war in the various crafts. This, and the existence of injunctions which seem to deny to the unions certain rights which they claim are lawful and are necessary to the maintenance of union principles, are the two obstacles to a practical and early settlement of all differ - ences. It would seem that your Excellency should consider what might be done with regard to the first, and doubtless the courts will adjust the other. During the progress of the hearing attorneys for employees suc - ceeded in transferring the injunction case for hearing in the Federal Court. It was felt that the matter could be handled in a more satis - factory way in the Federal Court, inasmuch as it would define clearly just what acts could be enjoined and what acts would be allowed anil attorneys for the unions claimed that the unions or the employees had committed no acts which would be regarded as lawless under the Federal law. Judge Woodrough decided that the matter was purely local, and that the District Court had proper jurisdiction and remanded it back for hearing. Reviewing all the testimony and after full consideration of all the conditions as they were presented to our Board, we cannot help but feel that there is nothing in the situation at this time which might not be overcome if the parties to the controversy were willing to meet and confer in the proper spirit. While it may be true that employees have done those things which they ought not to have done, many have made unreasonable demands and presented an unfair attitude, and it may also be true that em - ployers have done likewise, we cannot help but feel that the dead past should be buried and that men should discuss the situation as it exists today. Proper perhaps to state that labor demands were made before the address of Secretary Wilson referred to in this report, and practically all before war was declared. Labor states positively that since the declaration of war, it neither asks for nor expects any greater privileges or rights than it enjoyed prior to the time when the trouble started. It is evident to the Board, from the testimony which came before us, that if the injunction asked for is made permanent a large number of men will be compelled to quit their employment because of a rule of the international union, which prevents their taking employment on any job covered by injunction of the nature now existing. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 53 The testimony taken before the Board covers some 1,500 pages. The Chairman desires to keep this transcript in his possession until the controversy is settled, for the purpose of consulting it should any question arise where it might be necessary to do so, and so that the public or any person interested might have ready access to the record. This report is made supplementary to the verbal report made to your Excellency on Monday, July 23rd. On that date our Board met at the office of the Secretary of Labor in the Capitol Building, and after a short meeting took a recess until Monday, July 30th, at 10:00 a. m. It was felt by that time the injunction case would be disposed of and we would then know whether it would be necessary for us to proceed further, and just how to proceed. It will be remembered before our Board met, the matters in con - troversy between employers and employees were submitted to the in - vestigating committee of the Nebraska State Council of Defense. State - ments were made for the employees by what was called the Defense Committee of the locked out building trades workers, by the chairman and secretary, and in this statement it was claimed that employers are organized in Commercial Clubs, Builders' Exchange, Electrical Con - tractors' Association, Master Painters' Association, etc., and that these bodies have further combined in and delegated to the Business Men's Association the authority and power to handle all negotiations with their employees. It was claimed that the latter organization exists for only two purposes, namely: to prevent organization among the wage earners and to drive the small contractor out of business, and it was further claimed that this Association is responsible for the closing of the material shops on May 21st. Statements were made by the Business Men's Association through its secretary in which it was claimed that the Association was organized fourteen years ago for the following purposes: "The mutual benefit, association and intercourse of the business men of Omaha and vicinity and the securing of co-operation and concert of action in the develop - ment and upbuilding of the business interests of this community." "To protect its members in their constitutional rights." "To discourage boycotts, sympathetic strikes, restriction of output and unreasonable demands that savor of persecution, as a menace to industrial progress and detrimental to the interests of employers and employees alike." "To encourage industry and thrift by enlarging the opportunities of young men to learn trades and become skilled mechanics and more useful and prosperous citizens." The Association stated further that the demands made by the dif - ferent unions early in 1917 were for the purpose of establishing the closed shop. With such a marked difference as to the claims and objects of the parties to the controversy, as set forth, we must reiterate that it is </seg>
            <seg id="p054">SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT 54 exceedingly regrettable that the employers nor the members of the Business Men's Association appeared before our Board, — a Board created by the legislature of the state for the express purpose of investigating and mediating in just such a controversy — and we feel impelled to state that it is our belief that if they had given us their aid and assist - ance, the public would have had a better opportunity to judge as to the merits of the various claims made, and we would have been aided ma - terially in forming correct conclusions, that the situation could have been presented more clearly, our duties made much easier and our investigation infinitely more satisfactory, if it would not, indeed, have opened the way for the settlement of all the difficulties. Much testimony was given by employees before our Board which tended to show that many employers would have settled with their employees had it not been for pressure brought by the Business Men's Association, and as no testimony was given by the other side to con - trovert them, we have been compelled to accept these statements as being true. Called together by your Excellency to investigate fully all the causes leading up to the labor troubles in Omaha, we are conscious that this is not a complete and satisfactory report. We are strongly of the opinion that the Business Men's Association and many of the employers will be advised by counsel not to aid us in our efforts nor answer fully our questions and this being so we see little to be gained by prolonging our investigation. We believe that some steps should be taken by your Excellency or the State Council of Defense to compel both parties to the controversy to live up to the spirit as well as the letter of the recommendations and requests made by the Secretary of Labor and so strongly approved by the President. From all the statements made to us on behalf of the employees and the testimony of a large number of them, we are con - vinced that labor stands ready to observe and obey the suggestions in their entirety. If there is any means whereby a similar agreement can be gotten from the employers, and both parties will live up to their promises, — much may be done to relieve the present deplorable situa - tion. After a careful consideration of all the testimony, we are convinced that under all the circumstances, laborers' demands as to hours of labor, wages and improved working conditions are not unreasonable or excessive.

            <seg id="p055">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 55 U3 IN RE REPORT OF MEDIATION BOARD. Objections on Behalf of the Labor Unions to the Report of the Board of Mediation and Investigation, Dated August 2, 1917. In considering the scope of the partial report of the Board of Media - tion and Investigation, certain points naturally suggest themselves. Any report emanating from the Board should be predicated upon testimony which comes before it officially. Mere statements of counsel, however formal, either as to existing facts or as to facts which it may be the intention to prove, should not, in the absence of testimony in the premises, be regarded as forming any basis for a finding or report of the Board. The approved procedure would seem to be that the report should recite that certain persons or a group adduced testimony establishing or tending to establish certain facts; that the adverse persons or a group, though afforded ample, even urgent opportunity to show their side of the controversy, failed or refused to accept such opportunity and to introduce any testimony whatever in support of their contention. The report, therefore, logically, from all of the testimony before it, should be a finding in conformity with the testimony in the record and no other. • ' "V The statements of respective counsel as to utterances of the respec - tive sides before the State Council for Defense is not testimony in any sense and cannot legally be considered by the Board in arriving at its findings. The same is true as to other extraneous matter. For example: Allegations made by either party in petitions or other documents in other proceedings, either in court or otherwise, or the contentions of either party urged before courts or any other tribunals, not introduced in evidentiary form in the hearings before the Board of Mediation, cannot form any legitimate basis for the report of this Board. Applying the above facts to the situation confronting the Board of Mediation at this time, it would appear that this situation is analogous to one which would arise before a court of justice where one party had fully adduced evidence in support of its contention and the adverse party, though freely tendered its day in court, had utterly failed to adduce any testimony in support of its contentions. In such case, it is a matter of common knowledge that the finding of the court must be in favor of the party establishing his case, providing it is found that the testimony is sufficient to that end. And the analogy may be pushed further under the record in hearing, namely: Even though both parties to the controversy made a state - ment of what it is expected by it to prove at the hearing, that action can lend no strength to the party who fails to establish its contention in conformity with such statement by adducing material and relevant testimony. And the statement of the party who fails to support it by </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT testimony, cannot be received either as evidence nor can it be con - sidered as a factor tending to support the contention of said party. (Signed) BIGELOW &amp; SCHREMPP, NINDE, POTTER &amp; OWEN Attorneys for Labor Unions. In the case of the street car strike in Lincoln, the Board of Media - tion made no investigation. On April 19, 1917, the motormen and con - ductors of the Lincoln Traction Company quit work. The reason was the discharge of a committee representing the traction men because it had asked the company for an increase in wages and an improvement of other conditions. There was little destruction of property aside from the activity of a few sympathizers. The most serious result was the death of one man who was interfering with the running of a street car. In 1917 there was a general strike of the packing concerns of Omaha. The employees had asked for an increase of wages and had been offered 2% cents an hour by the company. This the men refused to accept. The strike lasted but two weeks. A member of the Govern - ment Board of Mediation from Washington was sent to help settle the difficulty. He was successful in adjusting matters satisfactorily to the employer and employee. The employees accepted the IVx cents in - crease per hour and returned to work. Later there was a general in - crease in wages of all packing house employees as a result of the Altschuler Court Decision of Chicago. In 1918 the beverage workers of soft drinks of Omaha had asked for an increase in wages. A conference was held between the em - ployers and employees, but as they were not able to reach an agree - ment the employees went out on a strike. The strike lasted but one week. The Government sent a representative who was able to adjust matters satisfactorily to both employers and employees, and the latter returned to work. </seg>

They serve without compensation and their duty is to see that the welfare of the child is looked after in accordance with the state. The members of the Nebraska Child Labor Commission are: Gould Dietz, Miss Margaret Fitzroberts, Miss Gladys Shamp, H. H. Harmon, and Dr. Margaret Koenig. We are deeply indebted to this Commission for the co-operation it has given this department in ascertaining the actual conditions of child labor in Nebraska and in enforcing the child labor law, but we wish especially to acknowledge the service of Miss Fitzroberts, Miss Shamp, and Dr. Koenig. While the law is emphatic in its insistence on the presence of the child at school, it recognizes, however, that there are some extenuating circumstances which demand that children between the ages of 14 and 16 years be exempted from the operation of this law. There are some instances where a Mother must depend upon a 14-year-old boy for sup - port, or where a large family with small resources is compelled to de - pend upon the help of the children for its support. In such cases permits to work are given, providing that certain requirements of the law be met. For the biennium of 1917 and up to November 1st, 1918, there were 2,113 permits to work issued in Nebraska. In order that employers may be fully cognizant of the provisions of the Child Labor Law we herewith are offering suggestions how to comply with the Nebraska Labor Law. Inasmuch as these instructions contain the essential features of the law, the law is not published in full. TO EMPLOYERS How to Comply With the Nebraska Child Labor Law No. 1. Employ no one under 14 years of age. No. 2. Permit children between the ages of 14 and 16 to work only after they present the certificate properly filled out and approved. It can be approved only by someone authorized by the Superintendent of Schools. No. 3. Keep employment certificates on file so long as child is em - ployed by you. When he leaves your employment return the certificate to the Superintendent of Schools. No. 4. Keep on file a list of children employed; also post such a list in a conspicuous place near the entrance of the building. No. 5. Employ no child under 16 before 6 A. M. or after 8 P. M. or more than 8 hours per day or more than 48 hours per week. Post in each room where children work a notice stating the hours required of them each day in the week and the time allowed for each meal. No. 6. If child attends night school require from him each week a properly authenticated record of his attendance. No. 7. Do not be too ready to accept a child's word as to his age. Require proof in case of doubt. Ignorance of age is no defense against prosecution. </seg>

            <seg id="p063">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 63 LAWS REGARDING PENSIONS FOR MOTHERS OR GUARDIANS OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN The laws regarding the pensions for mothers, which follow, provide that where a family will become dependent because of the sickness or desertion on the part of the husband, or other reasons which will de - prive the family of his support, a pension may be granted by the District Court. We have the reports for Douglas and Lancaster counties which are given so that an idea may be gained as to the number of people who are asking relief under the provisions of this law. Douglas County is paying 278 mothers pensions. The assistance is apportioned among 125 widows and 397 children; 92 deserted wives with 268 children; 33 wives with sick husbands and 122 children; 24 divorced women with 74 children; 3 wives whose husbands are in the peniten - tiary, leaving ten children to be supported ; one wife of a blind man with five children, and one wife whose husband is in an asylum and who has two children. All together the mothers pensions are helping to care for 878 children. In Lancaster County there have been thirty-seven pensions granted on original petitions in the sum of $3,662.00; and sixty-nine renewals al - lowed in the sum of $6,465.00, making a total sum of $10,127.00.

            <seg id="p066">66 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT MINIMUM WAGE LAW In 1913 the legislature passed a law creating a Minimum Wage Commission. Owing to the absence of some of the members there has been no general report made of conditions in the state. MINIMUM WAGE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA AN ACT To establish a Minimum Wage Commission and to provide for the determination of minimum wages for women and minors. Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Nebraska: Section 1. (Minimum Wage Commission, establishment, mem - bers.) There is hereby established a commission to be known as the Nebraska Minimum Wage Commission. The Governor is hereby made a member of said commission. Within thirty days from the passage and approval of this act he shall appoint the following additional members: Deputy Commissioner of Labor; a member of the political science department of the University of Nebraska; one other member who shall be a citizen of the state. At least one member of said commission shall be a woman. Each of the above appointments shall be for a period of two years and may be renewed thereafter. Any vacancy occurring in the commission shall be filled by the Governor. Within ten days after such appointment the commission shall meet and organize by the election of a chairman and secretary. Sec. 2. (Expenses; office.) Each commissioner shall be paid all traveling and other expenses incurred in the performance of his or her official duties. The commission may incur o;her necessary ex - penses not exceeding the biennial appropriation therefor and shall be provided with an office in the state house or at the Stale Univer - sity. Sec. 3. (Wages, females, investigation.) It shall be the duty of the commission to inquire into the wages paid to the female employees in any occupation in the commonwealth, if the commis - sion has reason to believe that the wages paid to a substantial num - ber of such employees are inadequate to supply the necessary cost of living and to maintain the worker in health. Sec. 4. (Wage board.) If after such investigation the commis - sion is of the opinion that in the occupation in question the wages paid to a substantial number of female employees are inadequate to supply the necessary cost of living and to maintain the worker in health, the commission shall establish a wage board, consisting of not less than three representatives of employers in the occupation in question and of an equal number of persons to represent the female employees in said occupation, and in addition thereto the three ap - pointed members of the commission to represent the public. The chairman of the commission shall be chairman of the wage board and shall make rules and regulations governing the procedure of the board and exercise jurisdiction over all questions arising with ref - erence to the validity of the procedure and the determinations of the board. The secretary of the commission shall be secretary of the wage board and keep such record of hearings and arguments as the wage board shall direct. The i..embers of wage boards shall be compensated at the same rate as jurors in district court; they shall be allowed necessary traveling and other expenses incurred in the performance of their duties, these payments to be made from the appropriation for the expenses of the commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 67 Sec. 5. (Minimum wage, investigation, report.) The commis - sion may transmit to each wage board all pertinent information in its possession relative to the wages paid in the occupation in ques - tion. Each wage board shall take into consideration the needs of the employees, the financial condition of the occupation and the probable effect thereon of any increase in the minimum wages paid, and shall endeavor to determine the minimum wage, whether by time rate or piece rate, suitable for a female employee of ordinary ability in the occupation in question or for any or all of the branches thereof, and also suitable minimum wages for learners and appren - tices and for minors below the age of eighteen years. When two - thirds of the members of a wage board shall agree upon minimum wage determinations, they shall report such determination to the commission, together with the reasons therefor and the facts relating thereto, and also the names, so far as they can be ascer - tained by the board, of employers who pay less than the minimum wage so determined. Sec. 6. (Decision wage ooard, review by commission. Publica - tion employers, review by court.) Upon receipt of a report from a wage board, the commission shall review the same, and report its review to the Governor. If the commission approves any or all of the determinations of the wage board it shall, after not less than thirty days' notice to employers paying a wage less than the mini - mum wage approved, give a public hearing to such employers, and if, after such public hearing the commission finally approves the de - termination, it shall enter a decrse of its findings and note thereon the names of employers, so far as they may be known to the com - mission, who fail or refuse to accept such minimum wage and to agree to abide by it. The commission shall, within thirty days thereafter, publish the names of all such employers in at least one newspaper in each county in the commonwealth, together with the material part of its findings, and a statement of the minimum wages paid by every such employer. Any employer upon filing a declara - tion under oath in the district court to the effect that compliance with such decree would endanger the prosperity of the business to which the same is made applicable, shall be entitled to a stay of execution of such decree, and a review thereof with reference to the question involved in such declaration. Such review shall be made by the court under the rules of equity procedure, and if it shall be found by the court that compliance with such decree is likely to endanger the prosperity of the business to which the same is applicable, then an order shall issue from said court revoking the same. The type in which the employers' names shall be printed shall not be smaller than that in which the news matter of the paper is printed. The publication shall be attested by the signature of at least a majority of the commission. Sec. 7. (Wage determination, report to legislature.) In case a wage board shall make a recommendation of a wage determination in which a majority but less than two-thirds of the members coucur, the commission, in its discretion, may report such recommendation and the pertinent facts relating thereto to the legislature. Sec. 8. (Minimum wage, reconsideration.) Whenever a mini - mum wage rate has been established in any occupation, the com - mission may, upon petition of either employers or employees, recon - vene the wage boards »r establish a new wage board, and any recommendation made by such board shall be dealt with in the same manner as the original recommendation of a wage board. Sec. 9. (Special license.) For any occupation in which a minimum time rate only has been established, the commission may </seg>

Sec. 10. (Wages, minors, investigation, determination.) The rommission may at any time inquire into the wages paid to minors in any occupation in which the majority of employees are minors, and may, after giving public hearings, determine minimum wages suitable for such minors. When the commission has made such a determination, it may proceed in the same manner as if the de - termination had been recommended to the commission by a wage board. Sec. 11. (Employees register; witnesses, fees.) Every employer of women and minors shall keep a register of the names and ad - dresses of all women and minors employed by him, and shall on request permit the commission or any of its members or agents to inspect the register. The commission shall also have power to subpoena witnesses, administer oaths and take testimony, and to examine such parts of the books end records of employers as relate to the wages paid to women and minors. Such witnesses shall be summoned in the same manner and be paid from the treasury of the commonwealth the same fees as witnesses before the District Court. Sec. 12. (Statistics.) The commission may cause such statistics and other data to be gathered as it may deem desirable, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the appropriation made for the expenses of the commission. Sec. 13. (Discrimination against employee, penalty.) Any em - ployer who discharges or in any other manner discriminates against any employee because such employee has testified, or is about to testify, or because the employer believes that the employee may testify, in any investigation or proceeding relative to the enforce - ment of this act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of twenty-five dollars for each offense. Sec. 14. (Employers disobeying decrees, publication.)

            <seg id="p069">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 69 PART XI General Factory Inspection and Laws "Time was, and not so very far in the past, when little or no thought was given to the ques - tion of protection of human life from the dangers that threatened in the hazardous lines of man's endeavor. Few safety appliances were installed, and the resulting loss of life was looked upon as one of the unavoidable penalties of the industry. But an enlightened public sentiment has wrought a change in this respect, and today the 'Safety First' slogan is one of the most insistent and appealing in our daily indus - trial life." Governor Stewart </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT GENERAL FACTORY SUGGESTIONS These suggestions will apply to every factory or concern where machinery is operated and should be observed by both employer and employee. KINDS OF SAFEGUARDS Men differ on what is safe and what is a dangerous piece of ma - chinery, and as to the kind and the methods of safeguarding. But if a certain thing is dangerous in one factory, then it stands to reason the same thing is dangerous in another factory. Hence the same kind of safeguard will suffice, the important thing being, does the protector protect ? DOORS AH exit doors should open outward in every factory. CLOTHING Clothing often causes serious damage by a ragged sleeve, loose coat, or flowing cravat by being caught in the moving machinery. Especially is this true among female employees through loose garments and loose hair. The custom of clothing should be governed, in this respect, by cer - tain rules laid down by the employer. ROOM, LIGHT AND AIR Insufficient room and light are most conducive to accident. Espe - cially should there be plenty of room and light around dangerous ma - chines. Air is the stimulus to health and the prevention of accidents. Every stairway, hallway, platform, runway and passage way should be furnished with sufficient light, either natural or artificial, to enable persons to note obstacles. Hand rails should be placed on all ? fairs and platforms. The edge should be skirted so as to prevent tools and other articles from falling off. RULES AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR SAFEGUARDS OF VARIOUS MACHINES 1. All safeguards and safety devices and dangerous places and machinery shall be painted a bright vermillion red. 2. All exposed cogs or gears shall be inclosed in metal casing. 3. Every protruding set-screw in collars and couplings on shaftings or other revolving machinery shall be countersunk or covered with metal boxing. 4. Keys on shaftings, wheels, etc., shall not be allowed to project from ends of shaftings and all dead ends, of shaftings shall be enclosed in metal casings or boxings. 5. Pulleys, belts and shaftings must be protected by boxing or in closing the dangerous parts with metal or other suitable material. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 71 6. Belts should never be allowed to rest on shafting when ma- chinery is in motion. Rest hooks mu belting free from shafting. be provided which will hold the 7. All overhead shafting, pulley than nine feet from the floor must casings. i and belting which is not more be protected by boxing or metal 8. All belts must be provided w from the floor or should be provided th shifters which can be operated with friction clutch. The practice of shifting belts by hand, either on tight or loose or on cone pulleys, is dangerous and should be prohibited. The use of a stick for shifting belts on cone pulleys is unsatisfac tory, and while less dangerous than the shifting of the belt by hand, i unsafe, and the installation of a mechanical shifter is recommended. ROLL FEED MACHINERY, LAUNDRIES AND BAKERIES 9. All machines known as roll-feed in which the operator feeds, by hand, the material, there shall be placed at the point where material is fed into the rolls, roll guards. A device for instantly stopping the ma - chine by the hand or foot shall also be provided which shall be within reach of the operator when operating the machine. EXTRACTORS 10. There shall be placed around each extractor, when in motion, a metal or other suitable screen. WOOD WORKING MACHINERY 11. Wood working machinery is among the most dangerous of any used in industry. The circular rip saw, band saw, planers, wood shapers and the many other sharp-edged tools cannot always be made absolutely harmless. And yet it is possible to reduce the danger materially and often altogether. 12. An effective and simple help is a rubber mat to prevent the operator from slipping. Circular saw guards are manufactured by many firms and of various styles suitable to the machine. 13. A simple arrangement of wooden boxings or partitions will ac - complish the desired object with the band saw. This guard will catch the saw if broken and should also contain an exhaust to carry away the saw-dust. 14. Wood planers, wood shapers, swing saws, equalizing saws, cir - cular heading jointers, wood polishers, buzz planers, lathe bolters and all similar machines used in mill and wood working factories, shall be equipped with safety devices necessary for the protection of the opera - tors. ELECTRICAI 15. All floors involving dangerous connections with metal at high </seg>

Signs or indicating lamps must be used at all switches, in electric light and power plants or other places where high pressure currents are used, to show whether the current is on or off each circuit. When current is turned off a circuit, for repair, the switch must first be tagged as a means of showing for whom it is turned off and said tag shall bear the name of the person for whom switch is so tagged. Said tag shall not be removed or current turned on until the person for whom it was tagged shall notify the operator that his work has ceased. 17. All generating machines, dynamo motors and transformer boxes shall be efficiently grounded and should be surrounded with wooden fence or railing or other non-conducting material. ELEVATORS 18. Every elevator, whether freight or passenger, shall be equipped with a speed governor safety device. 19. Every elevator shall be equipped with gates or doors to be not less than six feet in height. Lever bars or chains shall not be used. 20. All freight elevators shall be equipped with a signal or gong to warn persons of its approach. 21. All latches or locks on elevator doors must be kept in good order. 22. All freight elevators must be inclosed on all four sides to the height of not less than six feet, and all floors should be provided with taper toe guards. By GEO. E. NORMAN, Chief Deputy Compensation Commissioner. GENERAL INSPECTION LAW 3588 Sec. 38. (Sanitation, employees, water-closets.)

            <seg id="p080">80 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT MANUFACTURING STATISTICS OF NEBRASKA Nebraska always has been and always will be pre-eminently an agri - cultural state. Statistics show that she has come to be one of the greatest agricultural states in the Union. Indeed, we have become so satiated with the agricultural idea that we have lost sight of the fact that Nebraska has slowly, but surely, been developing important manu - facturing industries. Nebraska has, according to the statistics of 1917, 1,449 manufacturing establishments. However, this does not tell the whole story because some manufacturers have neglected to fill out and send in the report blanks sent out by the Department of Labor. In all, three requests were mailed out, and while most firms responded promptly, others were slow in responding or failed to report at all. The purpose of the Department of Labor is to gather all statistics possible about labor, manufacturing, etc., for Nebraska. This information is invaluable to the public and will serve as a guide to the legislature in helping them to arrive at more correct conclusions when labor legislation is called for. If employers would be more prompt in sending in their reports, or would not ignore them altogether our reports would be more accurate and hence more valuable. Employers are required by law to send in such information to the Department as the Labor Commisisoner may see fit to ask for. A fine of $10.00 is further provided by law in case there is failure to comply. We have never seen fit to resort to such drastic means to get informa - tion; we feel there are better ways to secure co-operation from em - ployers. These failures to comply are not palpable so much as they are a matter of neglect. We are earnestly requesting all employers in the state to fill out these blanks and send as soon as possible all information asked for. In 1916 only 923 employers sent in reports; this year 1,449 re - sponded. One thing Is patent: that manufacturing is steadily Increas - ing. In the tabulated report that follows not only the number of manu - facturing establishments are given, but the character of the organization, location of the establishment, size of labor force, etc., are also recorded. In reading the table the results are based on the aggregate of the re - ports sent in by the various firms. According to the statistics gathered $84,619,764.88 represents the amount of capital invested in manufacturing in Nebraska. But here again we must call attention to the fact that it is more than this; how much more we are unable to state, because of the failure of some firms to report. For 1916 there were 114 employees in the state under 16 years of age. For 1917 the number is 980. It is to be noted that comparatively few women are employed; the number is 3,472; while for men it is 18,641. For 1917 these numbers are 5,202 and 24,640, respectively. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 81 In all, the manufacturing concerns of Nebraska spent $22,750,273.08 in wages during 1916, while for 1917 the amount is $23,664,640.72. While these figures are not as large as for some of the other industries, yet they add considerable to the output of the state and give some idea as to the growth of manufacture. This sum is more than twice the amount spent for education in the state. Other items which attest growth are those of the total value of pro - duction. For 1916 it is $208,194,252.56; for 1917 it is $265,876,144.94. Of these manufactured products 58% were sold in the state and only 42% outside of the state in 1916. In 1917, 67&lt;7 t were sold in the state. This would seem to indicate that manufacturing in Nebraska has come as a result of a strong local need or else that the future of manufacturing is only in its infancy. We will take the optimistic view of the situation and assume the latter. Before leaving the analysis of these figures we shall pause to con - sider the question of wages for men and women. Men have been re - ceiving 66% higher wages than women. In many cases this is for equal work done. The average yearly wage for men is $793.66, while for women it is $560.56. Should prices continue to rise or should they stabilize at the present level an adjustment must assuredly be made. The discrepancy between the amount of wages paid men and women for the same work is more a matter of tradition than common sense. The real basis of wage compensation should be the value of services rendered rather than who rendered the services. However, it is to be noted that in the last months of 1918 wages have been increasing. Though we have no facts at our command which will show the true proportion of these wages to the present cost of living which is going up all the time. </seg>

            <seg id="p169">STATE DEPARTMENT OP LABOR 171 PART XIII Surplus Shipments THE ESSENCE OF PATRIOTISM The essence of patriotism lies in the willingness to sacrifice for one's ocuntry, just as true greatness finds expression, not in blessings enjoyed, but in good bestowed. Read the words in - scribed on the monuments reared by loving hands to the heroes of the past; they do not speak of wealth inherited, or honors bought, or of hours in leisure spent, but of service done. Twenty years, forty years, a life or a life's most precious blood he yielded up for the welfare of his fellows — this is the simple story which proves that it is now, and ever has been more blessed to give than to receive. The officer was a patriot when he gave his ability to his country and risked his name and fame upon the fortunes of war; the private soldier was a patriot when he took his place in the ranks and offered his body as a bulwark to protect the flag; the wife was a patriot when she bade her husband farewell and gathered about her the little brood over which she must exercise both a mother's and a father's care; and if there can be de - grees of patriotism, the mother stood first among the patriots when she gave to the nation her sons, the divinely appointed support of her declining years, and as she brushed the tears away, thanked God that He had given her the strength to rear strong and courageous sons for the battlefield.

            <seg id="p170">172 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT SURPLUS SHIPMENTS The following tables, giving the surplus shipments of the state for the years 1916 and 1917, contain items of information which are most in - teresting. These shipments represent production over and above the amount required for local use. The data for these tables are secured from the railroads and express companies at their various stations. They have co-operated in every way with the Department of Labor in its efforts to apprise the people of the state of the productive capacity of the state and the individual counties. There are, however, some elements entering into the compilation of these figures which cause inaccuracies to creep in. It is impossible, for example, to get an accurate account of reshipments, which should not be taken into consideration. For the most part these figures represent a fair estimate of production. It is indeed interesting to speculate upon the increase or decrease of the output of some of the staple commodities of foods. The year 1916 was the year before the United States became involved In the great world war, and it is to be noted that in some commodities we find a great falling off in 1917 and in others a great increase. It would still be more enlightening if we had the figures for 1918 to compare, but this is impossible, as the report must be in to the printer two or three months before the close of the year. Reverting to the main topic again, we will call attention to some specific instances to illustrate. In 1916 we find there was a surplus ship - ment of 19,427,254 dozen eggs; in 1917 the surplus was almost doubled, amounting to 36,934,098 dozen. In 1916 there were 3,074,116 hogs shipped and in 1917 the number increased to 4,061,078. Sheep fell off from 1,807,076 in 1916 to 1,774.748 in 1917. It will be recalled that in 1917 the government made an active campaign to plant every available space, and to increase every needful commodity of food for ourselves and our Allies. Nebraska has done her share as will be seen from the fact that the output of barley increased from 695,269 bushels in 1916 to 3.140,587 bushels in 1917. In 1916 there was a surplus of 17,973,518 bushels of oats; in 1917, 48,204,961 bushels. There are, however, some things which show a decided falling off. The wheat shipments were reduced from 124,609,799 bushels in 1916 to 49,017,175 in 1917; milk from 2,119,340 gallons to 612,981 gallons; dressed meats from 341,872,641 pounds to 246,940,216 pounds; dressed poultry from 10,512,421 pounds to 7,987,882 pounds; flour from 260,532,950 pounds to 256,897,067; live poultry from 18,021,249 pounds to 13,358,210 pounds, and sugar from 43,241,225 pounds to 42,422,378 pounds. There may be numerous reasons assigned for the notable increase in some articles, and decrease in others. In 1917 there was a good crop raised and an undoubted increase in acreage over previous years. The returns show this clearly in some instances, but in other things there is a large decline. </seg>
            <seg id="p171">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 173 We will not seek to assign any reasons, but simply state the facts and leave the interpretation to the reader. States are always eloquent in facts if one takes the time to read them. When you begin to ask yourself the reason for things you find, statistical tables assume a new importance and are then shorn of the "dryness" usually accredited to them. These tables are not given to fill space in the report; they carry a most interesting and significant story.

            <seg id="p251">STATE DEPARTMENT OP LABOR 253 NEBRASKA In another part of this report we stated that matter not pertaining strictly to the work of this department would be eliminated. However, we are impelled to inject into the report at this point some facts about Nebraska which every loyal Nebraskan should know, and knowing should cherish. A pardonable pride in the achievements of our fair state leads us to take a side a trip from the real intent of this volume, and tell of some of the things for which Nebraska is noted. We are proud of the great advance made in all lines of business activity. Great manufacturing industries have risen which may yet con - tend with agriculture for pre-eminence of occupation. Her fields have yielded a rich harvest and everywhere is contentment and happiness. Once designated on the map as the Great American Desert, Nebraska now is considered one of the greatest agricultural states in the Union. There are men in Nebraska whose personal history for many years marks the development of Nebraska from a desert to a garden. Ne - braska, the land of opportunity; with its broad fields, smiling orchards and rolling prairies. On its eastern border the Missouri River wended its way for centuries with none but the savage ear of the Indian and wild animal to catch the sound of greatness in the music of its waters. On the west the pine trees called unheeded to the vitalizing forces of civilization. From the north the icy breath of the North Wind swept unchecked by the will of man. From the south the amorous breezes of a warmer clime pointed in vain to this vast expanse of territory pregnant with riches. These men were here before Nebraska became a state; when the few settlers there were lived in constant dread of the ravags of th wolf and coyots upon his live stock. But behold for yourselves the transformation. The Indian reluctantly, but surely, has given way before the relentless industry of the white man. His war whoop has given its last sepulchral utterance and in its stead is heard the clear metallic ring of the ham - mer of industry, and the busy chug of the locomotive. The scalping knife no longer tastes the blood of brave men. The melancholy tread of the buffalo no longer beats upon the bosom of the prairies. Thousands of homes enjoying the blessings of enterprise and thrift have crowded out the lair of the wolf who skulks off saddened at the loss of his empire. Myriads of cattle and sheep graze contented and happy in our vast pasture lands. You do not have to pack your grip and go to distant lands to find beautiful scenery; Nebraska is full of it and running over. The bluffs and pinnacled rocks of the western Platte country, the pine ridges in the northwest with their majestic buttes and silhoutted ridges, the great plains of the west, the beautiful fields and streams of the eastern half of the state, are among natures finest handiwork. The pine-clad buttes of Northwest Nebraska guard the greatness of our state. The secrets of wealth hidden deep in their bosom for cen- </seg>

When the crimson into blue, and the blue softly steals into violet, and the violet melts into orange. When standing on the summit of the buttes at such a time it seems you had only to stretch forth your anxious hand to clasp the purple hills of eternity. Let this poem, written by a loyal son of our fair state, rule the hearts, the lives of all Nebraskans: HYMN TO NEBRASKA Now laud the proud tree planter state, Nebraska, — free, enlightened, great; Her royal place she has in song: The noblest strains to her belong: Her fame is sure Then sing Nebraska through the years; Extol her stalwart pioneers; The days when, staunch and unafraid. The states foundations, well they laid, To long endure. The land where Coronado trod, And brave Marquette surveyed the sod; Where red men long in council sat; Where spread the valley of the Platte Far 'neath the sun. The land, beside whose borders sweep The big Missouri's waters, deep, Whose course erratic, through its sands, From northland on, through many lands Does seaward run. The foothills of the Rockies lie Afar athwart her western sky; Her rolling prairie, like the sea. Held long in virgin sanctity, Her fertile loam. Her wild-life roamed oer treeless plains, Till came the toiling wagon-trains. And settlers bold, far westward -bound, In broad Nebraska's valley found Their chosen home. </seg>
            <seg id="p253">25 H. Buss STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Now o'er her realm and 'neath her sky, Her golden harvests richly lie; Her corn more vast than Egypt yields; Her grain unmatched in other fields Her cattle rare: Alfalfa fields, by winding streams; And sunsets, thrilling poets' dreams; These all we sing, and know that time Has ne'er revealed a fairer clime, Or sweeter air. O proud Nebraska, brave and free; Thus sings thy populace to thee. Thy virile strength, thy love of light; Thy civic glory, joined with right, Our hearts elate. Thy manly wisdom, firm to rule: Thy womanhood in church and school; Thy learning, culture, art and peace, Do make thee strong, and ne'er shall cease To keep thee great. Her heaving bluffs uplift their heads Along her winding river-beds. And, pleasing far the traveler's view, — Well guard her Elkhorn and her Blue, Encrowned with wood. And there, by landmarks, ne'er to fail, Upon the ancient westward trail; Or graven stone, securely placed, By eye observant may be traced Where wigwam stood Her honored cities grow in wealth; In thriving commerce, public health Her first, the gateway of the west; Her Omaha, that will not rest. Nor take defeat. Her capital of worthy fame, That bears the mighty Lincoln's name, And thousands of Nebraska youth E'er summons to her fount of truth At learning's seat. — Reverend William </seg>
            <seg id="p254">256 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT FACTS ABOUT NEBRASKA One year ago, 1917, Nebraska celebrated her golden anniversary. As compared with some of her sister states she is quite an infant. How - ever, those who have been watching her progress must admit she has grown to be a lusty youngster. Indeed Nebraska is only at the threshold of her possibilities of development. Within fifty years the assessed valuation of property has grown from $18,000,000 to $2,404,070,960. Dur - ing this time 140,000 farms have been created producing annually 350, - 000,000 bushels of food. Her annual output of wealth is $650,000,000. She now has more than 200,000 homes which have added $4,000,000,000 to the world's wealth. , Truly here is a record to be proud of. Once designated as a part of the great American Desert, she has steadily grown in population and resources until now her products are no small part of the nation's wealth. A new industry has sprung up in Nebraska which will become a leading activity, not only in the state, but in the United States — the potash industry. There seems to be no limit to the available supply. Little way stations which seemingly had little excuse for existence have now become thriving communities. We can truthfully say that Ne - braska's resources have been little touched as yet. Not only has Nebraska prospered in the material things of this world, but she has taken due care to see that the intellectual develop - ment of her young people shall not be neglected. The biggest business in Nebraska today is her public school system. She has one of the largest state university in the United States and four great normal schools to prepare teachers. Nebraskans may feel a pardonable pride in the achievements of their state, and it may be further said that it is almost literally true that once a Nebraskan always a Nebraskan. The original territory of Nebraska contained 351,558 square miles. From this came the three great states of Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota; about three-fourths of the greater state of Wyoming; nearly all the immense state of Montana; and made a considerah'c con - tribution to Colorado. Virginia is the mother of presidents, hut Ne - braska is the mother of states which help make presidents. Nebraska contains 76,808 square miles and approximates 49,797,120 acres. The average Nebraska farm is 297.8 acres. The total population of Nebraska in 1910 was 1,192,214, of which 880,000 are rural and 310,000 urban. Nebraska ranks: 3 in production of hay 4 in production of wheat 12 in milch cows 3 in other cattle 4 in value of swine C in value of horses </seg>
            <seg id="p255">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 257 5 in value of four leading crops 13 in rural population While in the matter of real American spirit which puts country ahead of every other consideration there are none of the sister states ahead of Nebraska. In this matter we are also glad to note that all the others are just as good. Here we are all equals and stand shoulder to shoulder for one common country. Omaha is the greatest distributing center for sheep of the feeder class in the world. Nebraska is a very young state politically and economically, yet it has won third place in the production of hogs and of corn and fourth place in the cattle and wheat industries. The present output of the Nebraska packing houses approximates $100,000,000. Our devotion to agriculture has blinded us to the fact that Nebraska is strategically located for commerce. Its situation Is approximately central in relation to the country at large and is intersected by five great railway systems. Five trunk lines lead out from, or pass through Omaha. Two count Lincoln as a principal point of their lines. Nebraska is 415 miles at its point of greatest length and 405 miles wide at its point of greatest width. Mean temperature, 56 degrees. Per capita wealth is $2,903.90. The largest smelter of fine ores in the United States is in Ne- braska. Six states have no bonded indebtedness; Nebraska is one of the six The Nebraska death rate is 2.2 all the states. less than the average death rate of Nebraska produces 65% of all the potash produced in the United States. Omaha is the third largest live stock market and packing center of the world. The altitude of Nebraska varies from 1,100 feet on the east to 4,400 feet on the west. Nebraska hens are helping to win the war. Their output amounts to more than the gold output of any one state or territory. Nebraska has 8,000,000 acres of irrigable land and 30,000,000 acres of land that are independent of irrigation. Lincoln has the largest creamery plant in the world. The potash industry is rapidly becoming one of the leading indus - tries of thet state. Western Nebraska is coming into her own. The Nebraska permanent school fund contains nearly $10,000,000 in interest-bearing securities. The school lands of Nebraska arp valued at not less than $24,000,000. Banner, Arthur, McPherson, Loup, and Keya Paha Counties have no railroads. Garfield and Wheeler counties have less than tea miles. </seg>
            <seg id="p256">258 SIXTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT There are four beet sugar mills in Nebraska, located at Grand Island Bayard, Scottsbluff, and Gering. During the Civil War Nebraska furnished 5,000 men to uphold the Union. During the present war to date Nebraska has given 50,000 of her sons for thet freedom of the world, or 4.2% of her population. Following are some facts about education in Nebraska which every Nebraskan ought to know. The data given below is for the school year ending July, 1917: 11,249 12,697 5,754,657.67 $6,811,762.24 In all, Nebraska spends $11,921,857.05 each year for the education of her children. The lamentable thing about education today is the rapidity with which men are leaving the teaching profession. Should we not look to some means to check this trend? Men can make more money in other lines of business, but there should be a well-defined at - tempt to keep them in the profession. Our educational system must suffer unless more men remain in the profession. If possible there should be an equal number of both men and women EARLY NEBRASKA NEWSPAPER8 Nebraska News — Founded 1854 — Published at Nebraska City.
