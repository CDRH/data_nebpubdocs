            <seg id="p002">SUMMARY BY LINES THE FARMER AND HOME-MAKER Use of time was studied in many Nebraska farm homes. Pages 1-4. Farm men and women had long work days, especially in summer. Pages 5-8. Visiting, church going, community affairs, movies, entertainments trips to the city, outings, and vacations were the chief away-from - homc uses of time. Pages 8-11. Farm people generally took " days off " or short trips rather than vacations. Pages 11-12: • Practically all Nebraska farm home-makers baked, washed, ironed, and sewed. Pages 12-14. • Some of the men and many of the women kept accounts covering the farm, the household, and the sales of eggs. Page 14. Most of the women spent time on poultry, dairy, and garden work, and sold eggs or poultry. A few did field work. Pages 15-16. Hired help was mainly for farm work and increased home work, but some women were hired, to help in the house. Pages 17-20. Sickness took time from work and recreation. Pages 20 and 21. EQUIPMENT AFFECTS USE OF TIME Radio sets, pianos, and phonographs made spare time more enjoyable. Pages 22 and 23. Cars, telephones, and libraries helped to offset the evils of farm isola - tion. Pages 24 and 25. Newspapers and magazines aided in the use of time in nearly all homes, but few books were bought. Pages 26 and 27. THE CHILDREN The farm child's use of time is especially important. Pages 27 and 28. Most farm children worked at home at tasks of many kinds and a few worked away from home. Pages 28-31. Play also was universal, widely varied, and most important amonir farm children. Pages 31-35. Fiction, news, and economic and other educational materials were read in the order named, Pages 35-37.

            <seg id="p003">The Use of Time in Farm Homes l J. O. RANKIN How much time do farm people spend in the work of making a living and providing for the future, and how much in recreation, education, mere idleness, or in positively harm - ful practices? Nobody can give entirely satisfactory answers, but this bulletin attempts to throw some light on the problems involved. It presents part of the . data gathered in a survey conducted largely for other purposes. It does not present a complete study of the use of time on farms but it does show in part how the men, women, and children on Nebraska farms use their time. Time may be spent in (1) the business of getting the neces - sities of life, (2) accumulating a surplus, (3) recreation, (4) self -improvement, (5) mere idleness, or (6) harmful prac - tices. Nebraska farm people probably spend more time in the first two and less in the last two of these ways than most non-farm people. Just what is the best use of time depends on circumstances and must be a matter of opinion. The pur - pose here is mainly to show how time is actually used rather than how it ought to be used. Sources of data. — Material from three surveys is pre - sented in this bulletin. The basic one is a study of 342 un - selected Nebraska farm homes made during the summer of 1924 in representative farming areas in Washington, Lan - caster, Clay, and Kimball Counties.' This survey is the source when not otherwise specified. Additional data are used from a questionnaire filled in by 343 crop-reporters' wives in 1919. These homes were scattered thruout the state as indicated in the map on the cover and may have been slightly above the average in enterprise if not in financial status. Data on musical instruments and community library facilities are in - cluded from a survey of 3,449 farm club women's homes studied by home demonstration agents in 1926, under the auspices of the General Federation of Women's Ciubs. These clubs are probably somewhat above the farm average. Sources of other- data introduced for comparison are given 1 in foot - notes. 1 Based mainly on a survey conducted in the summer of 1924 in cooperation with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, United States Department of Agriculture* and described in Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 210. Acknowledgments are due to members of the University Departments of Rural Economics and Home Economics for counsel and suggestions, to one field worker in each area studied, and to Miss Eleanor Hinman and Miss Helen Christensen, whose aid in the preparation of the data for publication was invaluable. Especial aid was given in the interpretation of the data on children's use of time by Miss Hinman and Miss Blanche Graham, who did the field work in Lancaster County. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 230 *3mSFE iqo^ ex Pf, ndi t«*;e— Of the 342 farm homes studied in 1924, exactly a third were those of owners; about a sixth, homes of: part-owners; 2 and nearly half, homes of tenants. Eight of the 342 were hired men's homes. The total cost of living of one-fourth was under $1,200 per home, S Sfl?aG betW M en , $1 ' 2 i° and $1 ' 799 ' and of one-fourth ?l,800-$2,499, while less than a tenth spent $2,500 or more. Owner-operators did not deviate much from this average in distribution among the expenditure groups, but part-owners were much more largely concentrated in the higher and tenants in the middle expenditure groups. Almost all of the hired men fell m the lowest group. The average expenditure per home for all home-making purposes was $1,680. It was greater among part-owners than among either owners or tenants. This was because thev had more and older children at home and a little more hired help or other adult population fed at the common table and perhaps otherwise supported, in part, from the family funds. JX pa rt ' 0 L Wne » r 0 J? ome spent ?438 P er Person. Owners spent $440, tenants $372, and hired men $274. With some exceptions, those who have the greatest incomes and surpluses have the best opportunities to spend less time at work and more in recreation, self -improvement, or leader - ship. Such opportunity may be spent in still further economic productivity on the one hand or in mere idleness on the other L,arge income, of course, does not necessarily mean much leisure time. It may be the result of steady work wisely done It must also be remembered that the expenditures reported in this study are not necessarily in proportion to income but rather m proportion to number of persons to be supported per household. It is also probable that those who spent the most time unproductively had less money to spend and therefore fell in the lower expenditure groups. Tenants with an average total expenditure of $1,590 spent a little more time in recrea - tion than the older part-owners whose annual total cost of living was $2,550. Owners spent the most time and money on education and recreation in spite of the fact that their total cost of living was less than that of part-owners. f m ™ Th ° Dort -° wner '■ a farmer who owns part of the land he farms and rents part from someone else.

            <seg id="p007">Use of Time in Farm Homes Summer and winter. — The rising hour was from 1*4 to IY2 hours earlier in summer than in winter and recreation time about 2 hours less, so the work day was about 12 or 13 hours in summer tho less than 10 hours in winter. Doubtless there were many more days off in winter tho the data gathered only partly cover this point. They include vacations and out - ings but not days of enforced idleness due to bad weather, sickness, or lack of work. The time in bed was about 9 hours in winter but less than 8 hours in summer. Tenure differences. — Owner, part-owner, and tenant farmers alike reported about a 15- or 16-hour waking day. The part-owners and tenants, however, worked a full hour longer than the owners. The difference was slightly greater in summer. The part-owners' wives had the longest waking day (16 hours) and the longest work day. Their lli/&gt;-hour work day was half an hour longer than that of the tenants' wives and ly&lt;z hours longer than that of the owners' wives. They took less recreation time than either owners' or tenants' wives. The married hired men worked a little longer than the average farmer but only an hour longer in summer than in winter. Area differences. — The west Nebraska area about Dix had a work day more than an hour longer than any other area. This was true of both men and women. In the Dix area the recreation time was very short, about 2 hours for both farmers and their wives. These peculiarities are doubtless to be ex - plained by (1) its more recent settlement, (2) the difficulty of hiring help, and (3) the greater percentages of part - owners and tenants in this area. Importance of increased leisure. — The farm people have not gained so much leisure as their city cousins and apparently they will not. In 1900 the average time spent in raising a bushel or a ton of a farm product had been reduced to a fifth of what it was in 1830. 3 Still further economies have been effected since 1900 and much of the work once done by farm women is now done in factories. Farm leisure had not been increased proportionately, for the machinery used has in part been product-increasing rather than labor-saving machinery. There has been some increase in leisure. Not all the time saved has been used in more field work or housework of new kinds, or in going to factories to make new products to meet new kinds of wants. Table 1 may give all the data needed for estimating the home-makers', but not the farmers', leisure time in hours per year. This table covers work days only. Sundays, rains, storms, vacations, and such other interrup - tions are not considered. ■ Quaintance, H. W. The influence of farm machinery. Am. Ec. Assn., V. 4. 29. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 230 The outings reported in the survey on which Table 3 is based are in addition to the vacations reported in Table 4, based in part on the same survey, and are in some ways more nearly comparable with the " days off " of the same table based on another survey made in 1919. Here again the figures for men and wives are so nearly identical as to suggest that their outings were practically always taken together. Summer outings including those in late spring and early fall were 3 or 4 times as frequent as winter outings. If dis - tributed evenly over 6 months the 13 summer outings specified mean one every 2 weeks. Trips to the city put farm people in touch with the world beyond the home community. They mean mainly trips to Omaha, Lincoln, or Kimball, in case of the areas studied. The men made 3 and their wives 2V£ such trips per month. These figures are far above the average for the state in num - ber of trips and probably in percentage, too, because one of the areas is within 15 miles of Lincoln and the other within 20 miles of Omaha. Clay County percentages are about the same as those of the state, but the trips per year number only 6 or 7. In Kimball County less than one-fourth of the men and one-sixth of their wives reported city trips, but these went about 25 times each. Both men and women in the Clay County area were engaged in away-from-home activities more than those in any other area studied. This is true of every item covered by Table 3 except winter outings and trips to city. It is true either be - cause of or in spite of the fact that this area is more largely populated by older people whose children have in many cases left home. It is true whether we consider the outside con - tacts per person or the percentage of persons active in the various ways: The Lancaster and Washington County areas showed more city contacts because they are located near Lincoln and Omaha respectively. The Kimball County area stood at the bottom of the list in outside contacts because of the greater distance to be traveled in this more sparsely settled western Nebraska region. Distance from town. — The homes within 3 miles of trading centers engaged in away-from-home activities of the kinds listed more than those farther from town. This was true of every activity listed in Table 3 except visiting and winter outings. The difference was not very great in the case of outings, .community affairs, and entertainments such as movies and plays. Church and Sunday School attendance showed the greatest effect, of location near trading center in case of both men and women. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Use of Time in Farm Homes In the Washington and Clay County areas the homes were about equally divided between those within 3 miles of town and those at a distance of 3 miles or over. In Lancaster County 60. per cent and in Kimball County 95 per cent of the homes were 3 miles or more from town.

Only 1 of these reported a vacation, which was a week Ions. VACATIONS AND DAYS OFF Vacations in 1924. — Only about a sixth of the farmers and their wives took vacations in 1924 and they took little more than a week. A few more women than men took vaca - tions and the women took somewhat longer ones, but the dif - ferences were slight. In most homes, farmer and home-maker took their vacation together. Only four families without auto - mobiles reported any vacations. Some of the trips taken largely for business and educational purposes were reported as vacations. Days off and vacations in 1919. — Farm' home-makers take days off rather than vacations, according to data from the 1919 survey, presented in Table 4. Three home-makers out of five took days off but only one out of 28 took a vacation. Wives of owners and those of tenants seemed practically identical in all these particulars except that the owners' wives took longer vacations in the few cases in which they took any. More than a third took neither vacations nor days off. Vacations and days off were taken to about the same extent in all parts of the state. They were a little more frequent in the eastern part. In Saunders and Seward Counties one home out of 20 reported a vacation. The average length was 2 </seg>

It is as truly so as work in the field or factory even tho its income is in the form of human welfare instead of dollars in the bank. Both are economically pro - ductive but otherwise so different as to be difficult to com - pare." Larger percentages of the tenants had hired men, doubtless because they had larger farms and planted larger percentages of their acreages to tilled crops. 0 There was less difference in percentages hiring extra help at harvest, threshing, and other busy times. Part-owners were much below the average in percentage reporting regular hired men but above in per - centage hiring girls. They employed domestic help only about a third as many months per year as the average, altho the household was much larger than that of the owner or tenant. The part-owner families averaged 4.6 persons as compared with 3.8 in owners' homes and 4.3 among tenants as shown in Table 18 on page 42 below. District variations. — Hired men were scarcest in the northwest and central districts, where only one home in 3 reported any; and most common in the west and northeast districts, where half had such helpers. In the west district about one-tenth of the farms which had regular hired men let them board themselves. Men em - ployed for shorter periods than those included under the term of hired men were commonest in the northwest and central districts. These are the districts which had the fewest hired men. Three-fourths of the farms in this area had extra helpers. Even they sometimes boarded themselves. Household help was commonest in the northwest, where one family in 12 hired a woman by the day, and in the west where one family in 15 had some help, half having hired girls and the other half women by the day. Hired girls' were com - monest in the central district, where one family in 20 reported them, but for only about 5 weeks a year. : "Leeds. John B. The household budget. 234 West School Lane.

            <seg id="p021">Use op Time in Farm Homes per cent of the housewives remembered any such illness and included it in reports. In these houses, about 3 persons per family had suffered sickness sufficiently serious to be reported as illness in bed, amounting to 26.4 days per family or 8.4 days per person sick. The percentage sick and the amount of sickness were distinctly higher in part-owners' homes than in those of either owners or tenants. This is in harmony with data secured from about 1,000 other farm homes. 10 It arises in part perhaps from the fact that the part-owners are operating more land with less field help than either owners or tenants, and in part from the greater number of children, invalids, and aged found in these homes. Invalids. — About 1 home out of every 20 reported the presence of one or more persons who were either totally or partially unable to care for themselves. This includes both illness and old age. Only one such person per home reporting invalids and aged was found among owners and part-owners as compared with 2 persons among tenants. It is impossible to determine from the schedules secured how much of this is due to old age and how much to other causes but as tenants and part-owners are distinctly younger than full owners, it is possible that their homes contain more elderly people than the homes of owner-operators who average about 45 years of age. District variations.— Sickness was commonest in the northwest district where 5 homes in 6 reported 3.6 persons sick — an average of 30 person-days per home or about 8 days per person. It was least frequent in the southeast dis - trict, where 2 homes out of 3 reported 1.3 persons sick an average of 17.5 days per home. This fairly uniform decrease in prevalence and severity of illness from northwest to southeast suggests that exposure to the cold of the north and the housing conditions on many of the newer farms of the west are factors in this problem of illness. Improvement of farm housing, heating, and sanita - tion would doubtless reduce the illness record. Other factors in the west are longer hours, greater fatigue, and fewer doctors, nurses, and hospitals. u The Nebraska farm family. Univ. of Nebr. Air. Exp. Sta. Bui. 185. 29 3(1. </seg>

            <seg id="p023">Use of Time in Farm Homes farm people have most time to listen and find it least pleasant to be away from home. It performs in somewhat different ways the five functions sometimes attributed to the press: (1) conservation of past knowledge of farming and home - making, (2) progress thru the spread of newly discovered facts and methods, (3) an advertising medium helping to determine when, where, how, and what to buy and sell, (4) recreation, pleasure, and relaxation, and (5) development of a healthy class consciousness without bitterness toward those of other classes or creeds. When we hear those of other sections, political parties, and industries often enough we eventually learn that they also are pretty good folks with reasons for believing as they do. 13 Phonographs and pianos. — The phonograph was found in almost exactly a third of the homes in every district except the south and southwest districts where the fraction was about two-fifths. The highest fraction" appeared in the southwest district where the radio percentage was lowest, suggesting that the radio and the phonograph are to some extent com - petitors. Pianos were available in nearly half of the club women's farm homes in every district. A 1920 survey of 1,141 Nebraska farm homes thought to be reasonably repre - sentative, showed pianos in only one-third of the homes and phonographs in only one-sixth. In addition, it discovered organs in one-sixth of the homes, a violin in one out of 15, an accordion in one out of 60, and miscellaneous musical instru - ments of other kinds in one out of every 30 homes. No in - formation about radios was gathered in 1920. Some kind of musical instrument was found in the homes of 4 out of every 5 owners and part-owners, of two-thirds of the tenants, and of a third of the managers. 14 Half of the representative homes studied in 1920 had either pianos or organs. The 1926 schedule did not provide for the separate listing of numerous musical instruments. It is possible that a woman asked in 1926 whether she had a piano but not asked about the organ said, " Yes," whether she had an organ or piano, since she regarded them as filling substantially the same place in the home. On the other hand, the difference may indicate a real increase in ownership of pianos and phonographs in these 6 years, or it may merely mean that the club women's homes are above the average in this particular.

A very few mentioned church and Sunday school libraries. . , Nebraska has a county library law permitting local govern - mental units to vote upon this system, which is undoubtedly the most economical method of meeting farmers' book needs adequately. Information with regard to it may be secured from the Nebraska Public Library Commission, Lincoln, Ne - braska. The Home and Community Department of the Amer - ican Farm Bureau Federation in December, 1927, resolved that : " Whereas, there is need for better educational facilities among rural people, we do hereby endorse the county library plan of making books available to rural people." The National Grange in November, 1923, similarly resolved : " Whereas, public libraries have become such an important factor in the social life of the towns and cities ; and, whereas, those living in the villages and on the farms are deprived of library service because of the much greater proportional cost under such condition's; therefore, Be It Resolved, That the National Grange, Patrons of Husbandry, approves of the County Library plan, which has proven very successful in Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, and many other states, and hopes to see it universally adopted." Opportunities neglected. — Only 7 or 8 per cent of the 342 homes studied in 1924 had borrowed any books or other reading matter from any source and only about 6 per cent from libraries. This is in spite of the fact that 3 of the 4 areas studied were within easy driving distance of libraries located in towns in which they did most, if not all, of their shopping. Both Fairfield and Clay Center have libraries and are doubtless the towns in which practically all the shopping is done for the homes studied in the Clay County area. One Of the other areas is close to Lincoln and another to Omaha and each has smaller town libraries nearer. The librarians of the state almost universally say that they welcome farmer readers or borrowers even tho they come from outside the territory that is taxing itself to support the library. When the contact between the farm people and the library has once been made, farm people are excellent library patrons, as indi - cated by the experience of the Shelton Township Library. 15 '■ Readins matter in Nebraska farm homes.

About a fourth of the boys and nearly a third of the girls indicated no play of the kinds specified. This was true of half the girls over 14 but of only a quarter, of the boys of this (15-to-21-year) age group. About half of the boys over 14 years old played ball and hunted, nearly a third fished, more than a quarter swam, a fifth rode bicycles, and more than an eighth played tennis. Among the girls of the same age, two - sevenths played ball, but only one girl swam or fished, and none hunted, rode bicycles, or played tennis. A slightly larger proportion of girls than boys played cards and other indoor games. They were equal in their fondness for stories, but more boys than girls over 14 took part in the family singing. In the 12-to-14-year-old group, on the other hand, the girls were more active than the boys. Nearly four-fifths of the girls and about two-thirds of the boys reported recreation. Ball, hunting, fishing, swimming, and bicycling had already gained the favor of the boys, while the girls, altho they played ball, still used the play tent, the swing, and the sand pile. About a third of the boys and nearly a half of the girls re - ported indoor amusements. The boys in this group outranked the girls in card games but the girls outranked the boys in story-telling and singing. In the groups below 11 years, ball, swing, sand pile, play tent, and story-telling were favorites for both. The boys added an interest in bicycles, croquet, and card games, be - ginning usually in the 7-to-l 1-year group. The girls pre - ferred singing and unspecified indoor games. In general, the boys seem to begin to play younger. Expenditure level. — In general, play was not greatly in - fluenced by the expenditure level, but in a few ways it ap - parently made a distinct difference. The sand pile furnished the favorite pastime in the groups spending less than $1,500 a year, partly or perhaps almost entirely because these were homes in which there were smaller families of younger chil - dren. The swing and ball were the most popular playthings in the families of all three expenditure groups falling between $1,500 and $2,499. In the "over $2,500 " group the ball was most popular and the swing had not disappeared but tennis got attention. Card games including "Authors," "cards," and others resembling them were twice as popular in the " over $2,500 " group as in the $900-$l,199 group. The gradation was not uniform in intervening groups but the tendency seemed to be present. Among indoor pastimes, story-telling was a favorite </seg>

Hunting, fishing, and swimming each claimed the attention of a fourth or a fifth of the children in the " over $2,500 " group but much smaller fractions in each of the lower expenditure groups. Here again the age of the children is probably much more important than the money spent.

HOME READING AND LESSONS Reading. — Fiction stood first, news second, and educa - tional material a poor third on the reading list of the Ne - braska farm children studied. This applies to home reading of course, as the table under discussion includes no school data whatever. The fiction read naturally varies greatly with the age and taste of the child. The very young child first hears or reads fairy tales or simple fiction of a less fanciful kind. Later come adventure and romance in their turn. About two-fifths of all children over 3 years of age read fiction, news, or educational material. Apparently almost half of this material was fiction and most of the rest was news. About 4 per cent of the children were reported as reading economic and other educational matter. Only a sixth or seventh of the 4-to-6-year-old children did any reading. Most of these read fiction but some read news. A third of the 7-to-ll-year-old children read mainly fiction </seg>

Another with boys 17 and 13 and a girl 11, reported the Child's Book of Knowledge, Bible stories, the Alger books, the Henty books, and 6 volumes of Louisa M. Alcott. It is probable that the children in these homes did some pleasure reading, even tho they were not reported as doing so. Such cases were exceptional, however. In most homes where reading was not reported for children of the pre-adolescent and teen ages, inspection of the family bookshelves showed an obvious dearth of material likely to in - terest a child. "There's not much to read," explained one Kimball County mother in excusing her 8-year-old daughter for not showing an interest in reading. The family library contained a Bible, a cook-book, and a veterinary book; the school library consisted of a dictionary and it was miles to the market town. Another home with a 10-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl possessed " just a few books in a box packed away in a closet." Boys read more. — Farm boys showed a keener appetite for reading than farm girls in every age group, as regards both the proportion indicating the habit and the range of interests covered by it. Of the 4-to-6-year-old boys, 17 per cent or one-sixth read for pleasure ; among girls of the same age, 14 per cent or one-seventh. In the 7-to-l 1-year age group, 45 per cent of the boys and 35 per cent of the girls had the habit. In the next group, 12-to-14, 69 per cent of the boys and 49 per cent of the girls had acquired the taste. Nine-tenths of the boys 15 or over showed it and seven-tenths of the girls. News was the favorite type of reading matter among the boys in every age group, and fiction among the girls. Even so, more boys than girls were fiction readers. They also read more news than girls, and more than 3 times as many boys as girls read economic and other educational matter. By expenditure groups Thirty-eight per cent of the children in the expenditure groups under $1,800 indicated reading for pleasure as compared with 45 per cent of those in the groups over $1,800. The advantage of the higher ex - penditure level groups was especially evident among children 15 and over. Seventy per cent indicated reading in the groups under $1,800 and 86 per cent in the groups over $1,800. In the lower age groups the distinction was much less marked. The variation was quite irregular from one expenditure group to the next. Abundant reading. — Twenty-five children were indicated as reading at least one volume a month, or its equivalent (300 pages) . A good many more may have done so, but there was no way of measuring the extent of their reading. Of these </seg>
            <seg id="p038">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 230 25 children, 18 were boys and 7 were girls. Three were 9 2 were 11, 6 were 12 to 14, and the other 14 were 15 years old or over. Only 5 of these children were in expenditure groups under $1,800; only one in a group under $1,500. Eleven of them, or 44 per cent, were members of at least one club, as compared with 17 per cent of all the children. In most cases this was a 4-H club. Ten of the children, or 40 per cent, were from homes having a library of 50 or more volumes. Terman and Lima found that "gifted" children 8 to 13 years old and 35 per cent above the average in intelligence read from 2 to 4 times as many books per month as the con - trol group of unselected children. 17 These were city children The intelligence rating of the Nebraska farm children was not obtained, but one may doubt whether it would show quite so close a relation between native endowment and number of books read because books are not always so readily at hand in the country. Home lessons. — Nearly a fifth of all children reported home lessons other than music lessons — a seventh of the 4 - to-6-year-old children, a fifth of those 7 to 11, 25 per cent of the 12-to-14 group, and a sixth of those still older. There were no marked differences between the sexes, but a slightly larger proportion of girls took home lessons in the age groups under 15, while above that age more boys reported home lessons. More children in the lower expenditure groups had home lessons than in the upper groups. Twenty-four per cent of those in families expending less than $1,800 were so re - ported and 14 per cent of those above $1,800. This is prob- Ai! y u &lt; L u ?, to - a ? ea Peculiarities rather than to anything else. All but 11 of the children receiving home lessons were in Clay County, where there were fewer families with the higher ex - penditures than in the other 3 areas. Music lessons. — One-fifth of all children over 4 years old received music lessons — 28.5 per cent of the girls and 10 per cent of the boys. These lessons were most common in the 12-to-14-year group in which 48.5 per cent of the girls and 13.6 per cent of the boys received them. In the 4-to-6-year group, 7.6 per cent reported the lessons; 10 per cent of the girls and 4 per cent of the boys. In the 7-to-ll-year-old group, 25 per cent received them — a third of the girls and 13 per cent of the boys. In the 12-to-14-year-old group 33 per cent of all children received them. Among children over 14 this dropped to 18 per cent — a quarter of the girls and a ninth of the boys. By expenditure groups, 26 per cent "Same, pp. S1-5S. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">Use of Time in Farm Homes of the children in the groups expending less than $1,800 took music lessons as compared with only 17 per cent of those over $1,800. This unexpected result is due to marked local fluctuations. The Clay County area, despite its low expendi - tures, provides two and a half times as great a proportion of music pupils as any of. the other areas. In the Washington County area, 11 per cent of the children studied music; in Lancaster County, 17 per cent; and in Kimball County only 9 per cent; but in Clay County 52 per cent were so reported. Books owned. — A few homes had libraries of from 100 to 300 volumes each, but in general books seemed to be less bought and less read than periodicals. One home in 16 had a library of 100 volumes or more; one in 10 had between 50 and 99; one in 4, between 12 and 49; and the rest gave a definite number below 12 or said " A few," " Several," or gave some similar answer. Less difference than might have been expected was shown between upper and lower expenditure groups in number of books owned. Among homes spending under $1,800, 35 per cent owned one to 11 books; among homes spending over $1,800, 40 per cent. From 12 to 49 books were claimed by one-third of the homes under $1,800 and only one-sixth of those above. With the larger libraries, however, the ad - vantages of the upper expenditure levels begin to show. Only 6 per cent of the families under $1,800 in expenditures had libraries of 50 to 99 volumes as compared with 14 per cent of those above; and only 2 per cent of those below $1,800 owned 100 volumes or more as compared with 10 per cent of those above. , . On the whole it seems evident that taste and habit have more effect on the family than financial status. It is not un - usual to find a family which reports music lessons, a piano, a radio, or other evidences of cultural interests and sufficient means to indulge them, but which reports no pleasure reading among its children and few or no books. The taste for read - ing and for the ownership of books has merely lacked stim - ulation. Where titles were mentioned, aside from the Bible and Biblical" stories for children, the authors most frequently met appeared to be Zane Grey, Harold Bell Wright, Gene Stratton Porter, and James Oliver Curwood. Classics were not infre - quently mentioned and no doubt formed a considerable part of the larger libraries whose titles were not listed. Standard juvenile books like the works of Louisa M. Alcott also ap - peared frequently. </seg>

The amount spent for these items increases more rapidly than the total cost of living as we go from the lower to the higher expenditure groups. It doubles as we go from the " under $1,200 " to the " $l,200-$l,799 " group, but the total cost of living differs only about 50 per cent in the two groups, being about $1,000 and $1,500 respectively. The "$1,800 - $2,499 " group showed only a proportional increase — about 30 per cent in each particular — but the " $2,500 and over " group showed another 50 per cent rise in total amount spent with the most disproportionate rise of nearly 200 per cent in amount spent for advancement and recreation. </seg>

Only a fourth of the farm homes paid for music lessons or sheet music but the fraction of the city homes was still smaller. A majority of each con - tributed to church support but the city majority was a little the larger of the two in spite of the general opinion that the city is less religious. It may be able to get better church services at much less cost in larger congregations. Much the same may be true of lodges and clubs, which the farm homes a little more generally and much more generously supported. Only half as large a fraction of the farm homes spent money for vacations — over an eighth of the farm homes and a fourth of the city homes.

            <seg id="p050">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 230 conclusion A complete picture of the farm family's use of time can come only from the combined efforts of (1) the farm welfare economist dealing with the life of the home, (2) the home economist studying the work of the home, and (3) the farm economist analyzing the work of the farm. Further studies in the use of time by farm people should emphasize living as well as making a living. Farm manage - ment surveys have analyzed the farm men's field and other economically productive work quite well. The home econo - mist is beginning to consider a similar analysis of the home - maker's job, also emphasizing the economically productive activities. Her work is not less economic or important be - cause it produces mainly an income of direct satisfaction of the family needs instead of a money income useful only be - cause it can be used indirectly to secure these satisfactions. The human welfare economist also is beginning to realize the importance of careful study of the use of time in his field The life of the family is no less in need of study and direction than its work. Work is very important but only as the necessary foundation of satisfactory living. The proper studies can call attention to the uses of time that have proved most worth while and most likely to be adopted by other farm homes with good results. They should also try " to make the best better by suggesting, wherever possible, improvements upon the best current practices. rsMj </seg>
