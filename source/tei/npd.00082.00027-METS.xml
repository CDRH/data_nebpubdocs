            <seg id="p003">The Effect of Pregnancy and Parturition on the Weight of Dairy Cows R. F. MORGAN AND H. P. DAVIS In experimental trials conducted with dairy cows to measure the effect of a certain feed or treatment upon milk and butterfat production or both, it is difficult to control the weight of the cows. The use of farrow cows tends to introduce unnatural factors as compared with common herd practice. The use of pregnant cows introduces a factor that has not been accurately or carefully measured, and some effort towards accurate measure - ment would seem justified. Since m most experimental trials it is desired to control the weight of the experimental animals, it is apparent that the effect of pregnancy upon any gain m weight made by dairy cows during .the trials should be considered. There are several factors to consider m the problem, namely: breed, age, body growth, and growth of the fetus, and associated with the problem are the losses due to parturition and the weight cycle for cows. REVIEW OF LITERATURE Little has been written about the influence of pregnancy upon the gain m weight of dairy cattle. Doubtless one reason for this has been the belief that pregnancy has little effect m the early stages of gestation upon the gain m weight. Buckley (2) showed a progressive gain with advancing stages of gestation. Davis (3) reported a study of 46 periods of pregnancy for 22 grade Guernsey cows. No information was given regarding the ages of the cows or as to which gestation periods were reported, but since the initial weights were generally quite uniform, it appears that m most cases the animals were mature. Based upon the first month, the average gain m weight during pregnancy amounted to 129 pounds, while the weight obtained the first month after parturition showed a loss of 138 pounds when compared with the weight just prior to parturition. The gains were relatively small for the first few months, rising rather sharply at the seventh month. Eckles (4) pointed out the great variations m live weight for the first few days after parturition. Eckles (5) also illustrated how growth takes place with accompanying gain m weight up until about five years of age, and showed the marked drop m weight after parturition. Marshall (6) quotes Ahlfeld's observations that "The foetus increases up to the 39th week and m the last week decreases." Bartlett (1) studied grade dairy Shorthorns over a five-year period. He used a maximum of 16 animals for any particular gestation period and tabulated the monthly weights prior to and after parturition by gestation periods from the second through the seventh gestation period. There was a progressive gain m weight by months, with a sharper upturn toward the end of the gestation period. Apparently these cows continued to gain m weight during each period up to and including the seventh. Only six </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bulletin 82 cows were used in the tabulation of the seventh gestation period. These showed an average age of over ten years, and an average length of time I between calvings of 466 days. It seems likely that the gain in weight during pregnancy above that of the fetus, for this gestation period, was due more to body storage than to growth. The loss in weight at parturition ranged from 154 to 190 pounds for the different gestation periods, with an average of 170 pounds for a 1 gestation periods. This average of 170 pounds was 12.2 per cent of th: farrow live weight. The average birth weight of the calf was 90 pounds with 80 pounds being the average weight of the placenta and amniotic fluid. . ■ Moseley, Stuart, and Graves (7) studied 53 Holstein cows with refer - ence to the effect of pregnancy pi gain in weight and of parturition upon loss in weight. These cows shoved an average increase in weight from date of service to just prior to jarturition of 285 pounds with the gain curve showing a rather sharp upt lrn toward the latter part of the gestation period. Calves averaged 97 pouncs in weight at birth and the placenta and amniotic fluid averaged 58 pounds in weight. Since the average age of these cows was five years and three months at the time of parturition, it is likely that some were immatu e. A series of figures are presented that were prepared by G. W. Herveyj and published by Moseley, Stuart, and Graves (7), in which, by using /angemeister's figures for human beings, he has calculated the weight of the Holstein fetus by months as follows: Month of Weight in Month c f Weight in Month of Weight in gestation pounds gcstatioA pounds gestation pounds 1 0.041 4 4.783 " 7 42.612 2 0.136 5 16.208 8 64.238 3 1.117 6^ 20.066 9 97.201 These figures, if correct, indie: ite that 94 per cent of the total growth of the fetus, as expressed by weight, occurs during the last five months of pregnancy. Figures are also presented by Moseley, Stuart, and Graves (7) indicating that the weight of the cow does not become stabilized until about the sixth week after parturit on. Young cows had the lightest calves, and there was a slight increase in calf birth weights up until the cows were four years of age, after whi h there was a slight decrease. Tabula - tions are included showing the relationship of the birth weight of the calves to their dam's weight, but the number of animals was small. PRESENTATION OF DATA In this study, data from the Herd records of the Dairy Husbandry Department of the University of Nebraska have been tabulated by breeds and by gestation periods on the basis of monthly weights. The practice was to weigh all cows on three Consecutive days in the middle of each calendar month and use the averhge of the three weights. Weights are recorded in pounds and the ages ire computed at the time of parturition in years, months, and day's. Daily weighings were begun at the 265th day </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Effect of Pregnancy on Weight of Dairy Cows of pregnancy and continued until thirty days after parturition, after which the regular monthly weighings were resumed. Calves were weighed as soon as possible after birth. Within the breed, most animals were related and the herd management has been as nearly uniform as possible. Cows were fed a grain mixture (about 14.5 per cent digestible crude protein), alfalfa hay, and corn silage, and had little or no pasture. ..Grain feeding was in proportion to milk production and roughage was fed ad libitum. Depending upon their production, cows were milked two, three, or four times daily. The animals used in the study are arranged by breeds and gestation periods in Table 1. As there were only a few Ayrshire and a few Guernsey cows in the fourth gestation group, these were combined with later gesta - tions to form the fourth-to-eleventh gestation group. Holstein cows were arranged from the first to the eighth gestation and then the fourth and above gestations were combined to show mature animals, and the eighth to the twelfth were combined to show the possible effect of age. Jersey cows were shown by gestations through the fourth and then a combination of the fourth to the eleventh. A total of 656 gestations were tabulated.

In these tables, which are arranged by breeds and by gestation periods, the monthly weights of the cows during pregnancy and for a period thereafter are presented, to - gether with the average weight for 12 months. The monthly gains, the cumulative weight increases, and the relationship that the monthly gains bear to the initial weight of the cow are also shown. Weight losses at parturition, birth weight of calves, body weight gains, and the weight of placenta and amniotic fluid are also presented in these tables. Table 2 presents the tabulations for Ayrshires, Table 3 for Guernseys, Table 4 for Holsteins, and Table 5 for Jerseys. (See pages 12-21). For the first gestation period for each breed, there is a fairly regular weight increase month by month, from the time of conception to the time of parturition. This is also shown in Figures 1 to 4. The percentage in - crease of the monthly gain in weight over the previous month shows com - paratively little variation throughout this gestation period. The cumulative percentage of gain in weight for the several breeds for the first gestation also shows remarkable similarity. At the beginning of the second gestation </seg>

The gains during this second gestation tdnd to move in a straight curve for the first four months, after which the curve tends to turn more sharply upward, and to continue bending upws rd (Figs. 1 to 4). For no breed (Tables 2 to 5) was the total gain in w:ight during pregnancy as large as for the first gestation.

For the third gestatioi period the gains were less than for the second gestation for the Ayrshire and Guernsey, but were slightly higher for the Holstein and Jersey cow;. The curve of gain for this gestation was very similar to the second gestation curve. The tabulations for the foirth to the eleventh or twelfth gestations may be considered to represent Tiature cows, since the work of Eckles (5) and our own unpublished data indicate very clearly that animals of these four breeds have reached matur: ty of skeletal growth by the time they are 60 months of age. The total j;ain in weight during pregnancy for the mature gestations was less than for any of the previous gestations, which </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Effect of Pregnancy on Weight of Dairy Cows is another indication that growth was not a factor. For the Holstein cows, tabulations are presented in Table 4 for the fourth gestation and each succeeding gestation, including the eighth. This was done to show any possible effect due to later gestations. A tabulation was made also of the gestations from the eighth to the twelfth to indicate any possible influence from the greater age in the cows. 1200 — y{3 91)0 - X b o-£&lt;&gt; ° 1"^*^ PARTURITION • — ** l|5 4|5 715 105 TOQ I I I I I I I I I I I ?

From a study of gestations four to eight, it is evident that gains due to pregnancy are not affected by growth. The initial weights varied from 1,428 to 1,459; the weight at parturition varied from 1,621 to 1,647; the average weights varied from 1,491 to 1,506; the gains due to pregnancy varied from 185 to 211; and the gain in body weight varied from 38 to 91 pounds. In general there were slightly lower gains in body weight as the cows grew older. This is emphasized by a comparison of the grouped fourth-to-twelfth gestations with the grouped eighth-to-twelfth gestations. Calf weights for the older group averaged slightly lower also. Table 5 shows the gestations for Jersey cows through the fourth and then a tabula - tion of the fourth to the eleventh. </seg>

It is apparent, therefore, that the gains during pregnancy bear a rather definite relationship to the initial weight of the animal and that the breed exerts a minor influence. The importance of body growth as a factor in gains during pregnancy is well illustrated when immature gestations are com - pared with mature gestations.

In each of Tables 2 to 6 is a column labeled weight average for 12 months. This is determined by taking the twelve monthly weights and determining a simple average. In determining this figure the weights for the first nine months are used, and then the weight at 15 days following parturition is used for the tenth month, the weight for the 45 days follow - ing parturition for the eleventh month, and the weight on the 75th day following parturition for the twelfth month. The weight at parturition is not included, since it occurs approximately fifteen days after the ninth month. In general this average weight is equal to the weight of the animal between the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy. At calving there is a marked loss of weight due to the calf, the placenta, and the amniotic fluid. In general the cows were weighed as soon as pos- </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bulletin 82 siblc after calving and in no case was the weight taken later than the following day. Each calf was weighed as soon as possible after birth to determine its birth weight and this weight was subtracted from the total loss in weight due to parturition to determine the weight of the placenta and amniotic fluid. The weight loss at calving varied between breeds and gestation periods from 78 to 151 pounds. The heavier breeds experienced the greater losses, but these maintained a fairly close relationship to the initial weight of the cow. Fcr the first gestation, the loss in weight at calving varied from 11.83 to 12.87 per cent of the initial weight of the cows for the different breeds. For the mature cows, the loss in weight at calving varied with the breed:: from 8.10 to 12.01 per cent of the initial weight of the cows. In relati mship to the gain in weight during preg - nancy, the loss in weight at calving for the first gestation varied from 33.97 per cent for Guernseys to 38.13 per cent for Holsteins (Table 6). For the second and third gestations, t le breed variation was from 44.14 to 59.47 per cent. With maturity (fourth to eleventh or twelfth gestations), the Guernsey and Jersey cows showed a rather close relationship, the loss in weight at calving being 5030 and 54.00 per cent, respectively, of the gain in weight during pregnancy. Ayrshire and Holstein cows, on the other hand, also showed a close relationship, the losses at calving being respect - ively 70.05 and 71.50 per cert of the gain in weight during pregnancy. The reason for the wide variation between the Channel Island breeds and the Ayrshire and Holstein bresds is not apparent. Calving losses were divided between the weight of the calf and the weight of the placenta and amniotic fluid. The birth weights of calves (Tables 2 to 6) showed littl; variation between gestations for the same breed, although the calves dropped at the end of the first gestation were slightly lighter in weight thEn those dropped at succeeding parturitions. Calves dropped by old cows (' Table 6) did not show any appreciable decline in weight. Calf weights tabulated in terms of percentage of the initial weight of their dams (Table 6) show that calves dropped following the first gestation varied from 7.16 to 8.41 and were higher than for succeed - ing gestations. There tended to be a slight drop for succeeding immature gestations, while for the mature gestations the calf weights varied from 5.86 to 7.06 per cent of the initial weight of the co\v. In percentage of the total gain in weight during pregnancy, the calf weights for the first gesta - tion period varied from 22.51 for Jersey cows to 26.95 for Holstein cows. Succeeding gestations showed that the calf weight gained in this percent - age relationship until for m;iture animals the breed variation was from 36.66 for Jerseys to 46.11 for Holsteins. The weight of the placer ta and amniotic fluid was quite variable, ranging from 22 to 58 pounds. While in general the heavier breeds showed the largest weights, there was no consistent breed or gestation relationship. In relation to the initial weight of the cow, the weight of the placenta and amniotic fluid ranged from 1.89 to 5.09 per cent with a general trend </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Effect of Pregnancy on Weight of Dairy Cows (Ayrshires were the exception) for the percentage to decrease after the first gestation. When measured in terms of total gain in weight during pregnancy, the weight of the placenta and amniotic fluid showed marked variations both between breeds and between gestation periods (Table 6). The total gain in weight during pregnancy is due to three factors, namely body growth, growth of fetus, and storage within the body, such as fatness. When, from the total gain during pregnancy, the losses due to calving are subtracted, there remains a figure which is designated as gain in body weight. This gain is composed in the immature gestations of growth and body storage. In the mature gestations this figure represents body storage only. As might be expected, this gain in body weight is largest for the first gestation for each breed, varying from 144 pounds for Jerseys to 194 pounds for Holsteins (Table 6). There is a progressive de - crease in this figure for advancing gestations with the exception of Jersey cows for the second gestation period, until for mature gestations the figures for the different breeds vary from 55 for Holsteins to 84 for Guernseys. When considered in terms of the initial weight of the cow, the gain in body weight showed a variation between breeds for the first gestation of from 18.65 to 23.00 per cent of the initial weight of the cow. This per - centage tended to decrease, so that for mature animals the gain in body weight varied from 3.80 for Holsteins to 8.00 for Guernseys in relation to the initial weight of the cow. Tabulated as percentage of the total gain in weight during pregnancy (Table 6), the gain in body weight for the first gestation period varied from 60.81 for Holsteins to 66.03 for Guernseys. While not always regular, there was a trend toward a steady decline so that for mature gestations the percentages were much less. The gain in body weight in percentage of total gain in weight during pregnancy was 28.49 for Holsteins and 29.94 for Ayrshires; and it was 46.00 for Jerseys and 49.70 for Guernseys. In only one other relationship was there such a wide difference between breeds. No attempt has been made to determine how much of the gain in body weight was growth, although there is every reason to believe that for immature cows the larger part was growth. A possible method of measuring growth would be to subtract the gain in body weight for the mature cows from the body weight for the immature cows of the several breeds. After parturition (Tables 2 to 5) some time elapsed before the weights of the cows became stabilized. This is shown, also, in graphic form in Figures 1 to 4 for the several breeds. In both the tables and the figures, parturition is placed at 9 l / z months, since according to most gestation tables, the period of pregnancy is approximately 285 days. With one or two exceptions, the cows reached a stabilized weight by the 45th day following parturition, which represents approximately eleven months from the initial weight at conception. The notable exceptions were the various mature gestations for Holsteins, although the Jersey cows in the second gestation and the Ayrshire cows in the third gestation also took a longer period to reach a stabilized weight. </seg>
