REPORT OF THK BOTANIST. 

PRELIMINARY ACCOUNT OF THE PLANTS OF NEBRA8 
WHICH ARE REPUTED TO BK POI8ONOU8, OB 
ARE SUSPECTED OF BEIXi 

BY CHARLES E. BE88EY, PH. D., BOTANIST TO THE BOARD. 

I. IMPORTANCE OF A KNOWLEDGE OF POISONOUS PI. A.MS. 

1. When we remember that from one hundred to one hundred and 
fifty of the plants of Nebraska are known to be more or less p 
or are suspected of being so, it at once becomes evident that a fair 
knowledge of these plants is of considerable importance to the pof 
the state. This is especially true of those persons who arr n 
in the fields and forests where they are likely to come in. contact 
harmful plants. Scarcely a year passes in which there are ii"' 
counts of the death of children and even of older persons from • 
the roots, berries or other parts of some poisonous plants. To • 
cases we may aild those, much less serious but still \erv annovii 
say the least, in which the poison affects the skin only, pro&lt;l 
inflammation, vesication and eventually desquaniation. M is so well 
shown in case of Poison Ivy poisoning. Strange as it m 
are many persons who are very sensitive to the poison of Poison Ivy 
and other similar plants and yet who are not able to dintinguisl 
harmful from the harmless species. Many specimens have been referred 
to me for identification as poisonous to the touch which turned 
out to be quite harmless. On the other hand I have known of cases 
where the Poison Ivy was planted for ornament about the lino 
suspicion of its true nature. 

2. Again there is a widespread opinion that annually the ¦tod 
lose many animals on account of the eating of poisonous plants. 
Scarcely a season passes without reports of such losses, especially 
in the western parts of the state. It is not possible to estimat. 
aggregate amount of such losses, but it certainly is large enough to 
warrant more attention than has hitherto been given to the sul 
Anything which brings losses to so important an industry as that of 
the growing of stock is worthy of the most serious ition, and

Ens should be spared to give aid to those who are suffering in 
ay. The importance of the stock interests is so great that 
'er affects them, at once affects the state. When the animals 
farms and ranges are suffering- the koM fulls upon the state as 
¦ upon the immediate owners. 

It is on these accounts that this report has been prepared, and 
hoped that it may contribute to a better understanding of the 
i of the state, and that through its suggestions may come a 
careful study of the plants of the state, so that eventually it 
ihle for any one to distinguish the harmful from the harmpecies. 


II. SOME LOWER PLANTS REPITKI) TO BE HARM FIT 

Kwill not take time here to discuss the lower plants with any 
i. since to do so would require far more space than can be 
i to this report. I may merely refer briefly to a few, and to 
e their nature in the most general terms. 

5. Bartrrin are, as everybody now knows, very minute plants. I 
¦re so small that in many cases as many as three millions could lie 
side by side in a single layer on the top of an ordinary pin head. Yet 
in spite of their extreme smallness they are among the most harmful 
of plants, and it is now known that in many cases the harmful effect 
is due to a poison which they contain, and which passes out into the 
tissues in which they are living. Thus in the case of those which 
produce diseases of animals it is rarely the direct action of the hacteria 
which is particularly harmful, but on the contrary it is the 
poison which is secreted by them which kills or otherwise injures the 
BS. In this way bacteria are to be regarded as truly poisonous 
plants, and it is proper that they should be included in this list. As 
a full discussion would be impossible at this time I will content myself 
with this reference, and the statement that bacteria gain access to 
the bodies of men and domestic animals by direct contact, and that 
if proper care be taken they may be kept out of the «ystem. Some are 
taken in through filthy water, some gain access through the air whieh 
often carries them for some distance, while still more enter through 

a slight wound, as a scratch or prick in the skin. It is known that 
in some cases insects carry the bacteria, and that whe.n these puncture 
the skin (as in the case of mosquitoes) some of the bacteria are admitted 
to the wound. 

6. Algae, which include the familiar 'pond scums' and so-called frogspittles,' 
and many other water plants, are generally regarded with 
suspicion. It is a common remark that a pond is in a very bad condition 
when it is 'all covered with a green scum." Now it should be 
known that most of the green scum on ponds is quite harmless, and 
that a pond is none the worse on account of the fact that plants of 
thi» kind are growing in it. In fact it is pretty certain that in mo&gt;t </seg>

            <seg id="p005">
97 


cases the green plants are good evidence' that the water is not foul, 
for it is well known to botanists that where the water is foul 'pond 
scums' will not thrive. Ponds are not the most desirable things to 
have near one's house, but if we must have ponds they are no worse 
for being gTeen. There are, however, a few green water plant* of 
the 'pond scum' kind that are thought to be harmful. I now refer 
to certain very small spherical plants known as 'Bur-balls' (Rivulmri* 
flvilanx) which sometimes have been found in ponds in such numbers 
aa to become a menace to the health of domestic animals. Some years 
ago in Minnesota many cattle suddenly died under circumstances 
which appeared to indicate that the cause was to be found in plants 
&lt;&gt;f this kind.* Shortly after drinking of the water containing these 
organisms the cattle suddenly died. Care was taken to eliminate 
other sources of injury, and the conclusion was reached that the algae 
were the cause of the trouble. 

7. Fungi include so many plants which are poisonous that it is quite 
impossible to give them as much space here as they deserve. At another 
time it may be well to discuss them at length, but now I moat 
be content to notice a few only. 

8. One of the most common of the poisonous fungi is the Ergot, 
which occurs as a parasite on the heads of rye, wild rye, wild wheat 
grass, and many other species of grasses. It is a parasite which 
attacks the young kernels of the plant on which it is found, and at the 
last it develops into a blackish grain from half an inch to an inch 
long and an eighth of an inch thick. In some grasses it is smaller, 
hut in the heads of rye it has the dimensions given. Many years ago 
I saw much ergot on Kentucky Blue Grass, and in this case the effect 
was disastrous, many animals being greatly injured by the poison. 
About twenty years ago a severe outbreak of ergotism occurred in 
Kansas, and on examination it was shown that the ergot was present 
in the heads of Wild Rye which had been made into hay, and on 
which the animals fed. The Wild Wheat Grass in eastern Nebraska 
is quite commonly affected with this fungus, but I have no records 
of any outbreak of ergotism on account of its occurrence on this 
grass. I find that the ergot drops out of the chaff very easily, and 
suspect that before the bay is fed, most of the ergot has fallen off, 
and perhaps in this way the cattle are spared. The effect of the 
ergot poison on young cattle is to produce gangrenous sores, often 
of such virulence as to result, in the loss of the hoofs or even the 
lower leg. The effect on pregnant females is well known, and doubtless 
many of the cases of abortion where the cause has appeared to 
be mysterious could have been traced to the presence of ergot in the 
pasturage or hay. 

9. A word should perhaps be said here in regard to Corn Smut, 

•Some Algae of Minnesota Supposed to be Poisonous, by J. C. Arthur, in Bulletin of 
tne Minnesota Academy of Natural Science*, Volume XI. (IMS.) 

7 </seg>

            <seg id="p006">
98 


fungus which is very common in most fields of corn, and which has 
been supposed by many veterinarians to be of the nature of ergot. 
In fact it is not at all uncommon to find that the Smut is spoken nf 
as closely related to the ergot, and as having the same propc 
Some years ago Professor Henry of the University of Wisconsin made 

Kful experiment with this smut, feeding it to a couple of cows 
considerable period of time with no toxic results. He came to 
ncluxion that if there was any poison in the smut of the general 
of that in the ergot, or any other poison in fact, it must be 
t in very small quantity, so small as to be of no account. 

10. I can not take up the poisonous toadstools which are common 
everywhere. I refer to the umbrella-shaped plants of various colors, 
from white to yellow, brown and black, which grow on manure heaps, 
in the woods, or on the open ground. They vary in size from an inch 
or less to six or more inches in height and width. Some of these plants 
are not poisonous, and yield wholesome food for our tables, but others 
ircely to be distinguished from these are virulently 
poisonous. The common Mushroom sold by the grocers is an example 
of a useful food plant in the midst of this group of poisonous 
plants. I can not too forcibly insist upon the danger of Collecting 
and eating the wild toadstools to be found in every locality. Too 
many of them are poisonous for any one to risk eating them. Better 
omit eating some which are not poisonous than to incur the risk of 
illness and perhaps death by trying to distinguish the good, from the

11. Joint-rvthes (Kq*i*ettim of several species) have l&gt;een siisp. 
of possessing- poisonous properties. One of the most common sp 
[Etiuixrttwi arrtnte) is a leafless, much branched plant, from eight to 
twelve inches high, and of a bright green color, often found growing 
along roadsides and railroad tracks. It may be recognized at 
by the fact that the stems are so loosely jointed that they may be 
pulled apart very easily, whence one of the common names. They have 
been called 'Horsetails' also, probably on account of the bushy appearance 
of some of the species. All of the species have a great 
amount of silica in their stems, and this is so pronoiinced that some 
were, and probably are yet used for the purpose of scouring cutlery 
and other metal utensils. On this aocount these species are still 
known in some places as 'scouring rushes.' although they are now 
rarely if ever used for this purpose. In Europe a related species 
(Kquitrtum palustre) is said to be fatal to horses 'when hay contaminated 
with it is fed to them in considerable quantity.** We learn 
also that 'a case of the poisoning of horses by eating the field horse-

tail (Eituixttum arrow*) was reported to the United States Department 
of Agriculture from Connecticut in 1871, and one of horses and lhaep 
from Vermont in 1899, and also in 1900.'* It is evident from the foregoing 
that we must include these plants in our list, although it ma.y 
be regarded as probable that the harmful action is due not to its 
containing poison, but to 'its harsh, scouring action in the mouth and 
Hnal tract.' Jonest confirms the poisonousness of the Joint-rnrt&lt;» 
for horses in Vermont. The species which he experimented with is 
Equisrtum arrense, which is very common throughout Nebraska. St 
lien Rhould therefore be on their guard in feeding 'wild hay' in which 
these plants are often found. 

I rakes (Pteridium nquilinum) have been reported as poisonous to 
and cattle in this country and England.) These are large coarse 
growing in woodlands and the land recently cleared of trees. It 
t been recorded as occurring in Nebraska, but as it is found in 
and also in the Black Hills, it is quite likely that it may yet 
nd to be a native of this state also. 

Kid Cedar (Juniperus cirginiann) is described as 'poisonous' in 
on Medical Botany, and H (listed! says it 'may poison goats 
feed upon it,' and that it is 'irritating to the skin and ina 
e blisters.'

The Lilt Family (IMiacrae). 

14. While the plants of this family are remarkable for their be: 
well'known that many of the species contain a dangerous poison, 
as in Meadow Saffron (Volchicum autumnaie), American Hellebore 
drum ririrfe), Lily of the Valley (Vtmrallaria majalit), the bulbs of

\ few species have been noted for their poisonousness to stocV.

otlirr species of this genus (7.. eleuan* and Z. nutttillii) also, are found 
in considerable quantities, but we know little as to their physiological 
•¦ffcct when taken into the alimentary canal. The plants are from a 
few inches to a couple of feet high, and have a single unbranched 
. which bears five or six long, narrow leaves. At the top of the 
stem is an elongated cluster of small greenish flowers. The plant

Bfrom a small bulb, and this is the part which is the most 
¦ poisonous. The first species named above has been very 
fhly studied by Chesnut and Wilcox* who proved by experithat 
both leaves and bulbs are poisonous to stock. There is 
' similar work on the other species which occur in this state. 

16. According to Halstedt certain species of Birthwort (of the genus 
Trillimm) are poisonous,' but I have no evidence as to the extent &lt;&gt;f 
the injury which follows the eating of their roots and other underground 
part*. As we have but one species (Trillium nirale), sometimes 
called the Early Wake-Robin, and this quite restricted as to its occurrence 
in the state, we need have little fear in regard to it. This species 
is very abundant in the valley of the Weeping Water Creek, and in a 
few other places in the extreme eastern counties. 

17. The Sand Lily (Leuoxrinum montanum) has been accused of containing 
a poisonous principle, but Chesnut and Wilcox doubt the justness 
of this accusation. It does not appear probable to me that this 
l&lt;&gt;« plant with its very deep-lying bulb, pure white, fragrant flowers, 
•anty leaves is a poison-bearer. 

The Cai.i.a-I.ii.v Family (Araceae). 

18. This family, which contains some useful plants, as the Calamus 
I Ar),ru» calamus), is in general characterized by the presence of an 
acrid poison. Fortunately the acridity is so marked that few persona 
or animals are ever tempted to eat of the plants in sufficient quantity 
to do much harm. Among the native species of this family is the socalled 
Indian Turnip (Aritaema triphyllum), called also the 'Jack-in-the- 
Pulpit.' The latter name is given on account of the peculiar flower 
cluster which consists of a thick spike surrounded below, and covered 
above, with a hood-shaped cover. The plant grows sparingly in moist 
places in the eastern part of the state, and attains a height of about 
a foot. It grows from a fleshy corm about an inch in diameter, and of 
an intensely acrid nature. 

IS. In all the very large family of the Grasses, numbering 3,500 or 
more species, there are but two that I know to be poisonous, namely 
the Bearded Darnel (Lftlium temulentum), and another related species 
(/.. linicola). It is true that some studies recently made by Dr. Peters 
seem to show that under certain conditions the common Sorghum may 
develop a poison, but this is quite certainly a pathological product in 
a plant which is ordinarily wholesome. This family includes not only 
the species used for hay and pasturage, but also the grains of various 
kinds, as wheat, rye, oats, barley, maize, sorghum, broom-corn, en-.

It must be remembered also that clovers, alfalfa, etc. are not here 
included, although they are often spoken of as grasses. The true 
grasses are plants with narrow leaves, which are sheathing below, and 
which grow on stems which have enlarged 'joints,' and very commonly 
are hollow. Maize and sorghum are notable exceptions to the general 
rule that the stems are hollow. 

80. There are from 140 to 160 species of grasses in Nebraska, and 
unleRS the Bearded Darnel, referred to above, has reached the state in 
its spreading westward, none of these are poisonous in their normal 
condition. The Darnel is an Old World plant which has come to 
America as a weed, and it has been moving westward for many years, 
until it is now reported from Kansas; so that we are quite certain to 
have it among our weedy grasses in the near future. Its seeds are 
the poisonous part of the plant, the foliage being harmless. The grass 
looks much like another weedy species, also from the Old World, viz., 
the Quack Grass (AgropyrMtn repent), but may be distinguished by the 
fact that the spikelets (flower clusters) in the heads are placed edgewise 
in Darnel instead of flatwise on the stem as in Quack Grass. It will 
be well for farmers and others to be on the lookout for this foreign 

The Iris Family {Iridaceae).

24. The Orchids are among the most interesting of the plants which 
grow anywhere. Their flowers are of wonderful complexity, and 
many possess great beauty in addition to their interesting structure. 
They are mostly tropical, and there many live attached to the trunks 
and branches " of trees, their strange flowers hanging down from 
slender flowerstalks. In Nebraska there are a few species, but all of 
ours live on the ground.

25. The Ladies' Slipper* (Cypripedium 
kirtutum and C. candidvm), 
are among 1 the best known 
of our orchids. They are leafy 
plants a foot or less in height 
bearing a single slipper-shaped 
flower at the top of the stem. 
In the first species the flower is 
yellow, while in the second it is 
white. Other species are found 
in the states eastward, and 
among them is one of great 
beauty, viz., the 'Showy Ladies' 
Slipper' (C. icyinae). I am not 
aware that this species has been 
found in Nebraska, but as it occurs 
in Iowa, I may well speak 
of it. &gt;Some ye.ars ago it wu 
found out that this magnificent 
plant is quite poisonous to the 
touch for many persons. Cases 
of severe poisoning have been 
rc[M&gt;rted in the scientific journals, 
and it is now considered aa 
well established that the plants 
are really poisonous. It is now 
held also that the yellow species 
(Fig. 1)* mentioned abov.

i I have never experienced any unpleasant effects from handling 
the ladies' Slippers. 

86. Buttercups are among the prettiest of the simple spring flowers. 
and many are accordingly found in cultivation in gardens. The plants 
are mostly herbaceous, and the flowers are characterized by hating 
all of their organs quite separate from one another, there being none 
of that growing together of parts which is so noticeable in jnost other 
kind* of flowers. The species are mostly pervaded with an acridiioiis 
principle, which is so pronounce;! in some species as to be 
virulently harmful.

acrid, as for example Ranunculus sceleratut, a common weedy plant of 
low grounds. Its juice when applied to the skin produces blisters and 
angry sores. Even the larger flowered species, as R. repent, is more or 
less poisonous to the touch. The Anemonie* (Anemone of several speciea) 
are known to be more or less poisonous to the touch, or when taken Internally. 
This applies also to the species of the closely related genus 
Pultntill-i. which contains the Pasque-flowers, Here too should be

28. The Larkspurs (Delphinium) 
however the most serious 
among the poisonous 
plants of this family, since they 
are greedily eaten by stock in 
the early spring with fatal re-. 
The plants when they appear 
in the spring consist of 
dark-green tufts of leaves which 
are closely packed together. At 
first they are quite low, but as 
they grow rapidly they soon 
attain a height of six to eight or 
more inches and are then very 
conspicuous plants on the 
prairies. It is at this time that 
they are the most dangerous to 
stock, since their conspicuousness 
attracts the hungry animals 
in their search for food. In 
western Nebraska there have 
been serious losses reported to 
me from stock eating the leaves 
&lt;&gt;f Nelson's Larkspur (Delphinium 
neisoni). An outbreak of a serious 
nature near Kimball, came to 
mv notice a few years ago, in 
which many cattle were reported 

to have perished. In this species f Ja 2. -Larkspur (Dtlpkinium Irwon* ),«•»-the

inches high, the leaves are 

divided into narrow segments, and the flowers are blue. Of course the 
flowers, which appear in May and June, are not to be seen when the 
rattle are suffering from eating the larkspurs, as It is found that

animals are in the habit of eating the leaves only during the early 
spring when the forage is. scanty. In the states farther west there are 
ral other species which have been very harmful. Thus 'Chesnut 
and Wilco'x* describes Delphinium i/lnurum and I), bicnlor, which they find 
to be fatally poisonous to stock in Montana. Other species of larkspur 
have been found to be poisonous, as P. tricorne (Pig. 2), a common 
eastern species, which has been fatal to cattle in Ohio.t In eastern 
Nebraska the common wild larkspur is I), albeteent, and it bears whitish 
flowers on a tall stem (often three feet high). It is very common, and 
vet I have had no accounts of any harm coining to cattle from eating 
it; in fact I do not know whether cattle ever eat it. That it is 
poisonous is very likely. 

The Barkerry Family {BerberMaeeae). 

2V. In this family we find the curious herb known by the names of 
May-apple, Mandrake, Yellow-berry, and Indian Apple ( PodophpUum 
prltatum) and which consists of a stout stalk as thick as a lead pencil 
and about a foot high, bearing two broad horizontal leaves on its 
summit. Tn the fork of the stem close to the leaves is a creamy-white 
flower two inches in diameter, and when this falls it is followed by 
a soft, yellow berry nearly an inch in diameter. Under the ground the 
plant develops long, stout, running stems, which have been used in 
medicine. These underground stems (roots they are commonly called) 
are poisonous, and care should be taken that children do not eat them. 
The berry is harmless when ripe. 

The Poppy Family (Papaveraccae) . 

30. The type of this family is the Poppy, which contains a milky juice 
in which is found more or less of opium, a well-known medicine, but 
at the same time a poison, also. We have a species of Wild Poppy 
{Aivemome intermedia) which grows throughout the greater part of the 
state, and while it doubtless contains the poisonous principle, I have 
had no accounts of its harmfulness. It is likely that its numerous 
prickles serve the good purpose of keeping children and domestic 
animals from meddling with it. 

EHalstedt says that 'the juice of the Bloodroot (Sanguinaria fa»-i) 
will poisim some who touch it.' This plant occurs only along 
issouri River, in the eastern counties. It sends up a single leaf 
spring, and within this as it unrolls is a very pretty white flower, 
•h or so in diameter. The plant gets its name from the color of 
&lt;-e. which is like that of blood.

The Mustard Family (Cmei/erae) 

k31a. In this family there is a pungent, irritating principle, but thr 
ants are not usually regarded as poisonous, and yet Dr. Rusby # 
eludes the common Horseradish (Roripa armoracia) in his list, saying 

of it 'while it would not generally 
be regarded as a poisonous 
article, yet used in excess it may 
become so through its powerful 
irritation of the urinary organs. 
Johnson gives a case in which 
this result was extreme and seri- 

ous. 

The Pink Family 

(Caryophyllaceae) . 

32. Here are some of the most 
attractive plants with which we 
are acquainted, as the Pinks, 
Carnations, Sweet Williams, etc., 
and yet with these are some 
which are poisonous and must 
therefore be avoided. For the 
most part they have pretty 
flowers and thus they art often 
tolerated when otherwise they 
would be at once eradicated. 

33. Corn Cockle (Agrostemma 
•itthapo) is an Old World plant 
which has come into this country 
as a weed in wheat fields. It 
grows to be nearly as tall as the 
wheat, has narrow leaves which 
rnd two opposite one another 
each joint of the stem, and 
pretty pink flowers nearly an 
inch in diameter (Fig. 3). After 
blossoming the plants develop

Agriculture.) 

many pods of black seeds. The latter are nearly an eighth of an inch 
in diameter, and are irregularly rounded in shape and somewhat 
roughened on the surface. A poisonous principle resides in the seeds 
which renders them harmful and even dangerous. As the seeds are often 
mingled with wheat there is constant danger that they may be ground 
with the grain, and thus enter into the flour in sufficient quantity to 
bring about harmful results. According to Chesnut the poisonous 
principle is 'saponin,' and when taken in sufficient quantity it produces 
'intense irritation nf the whole digestive tract, vomiting, headache.

nausea, vertigo, diarrhoea, hot skin, sharp pains in the spine, difficult 
motion, and depressed breathing.' Evidently a weed which is 
capable of producing such disagreeable symptoms should be very carefully 
eradicated from our wheat fields, especially since the bad effects 
are manifest also in stock which have fed upon grain containing these 
baneful seeds. 

34. Bouncing Bet (Sapftnarin uffieinali*). is one of the commonly grown 
ornamental plants in many gardens. Its pink flowers are rather pretty, 
and its green foliage is not unpleasant. Yet this is a poisonous plant, 
lining the same principle, saponin, as that which gives the («rn 
Coikle such a ba&lt;l reputation. In some portions of the country UiIh 
plant has run wild, thus adding to the danger arising from its pois&lt;mousness. 
Even in Nebraska I have seen some evidence that it is 
likely to escape and take to weedy habits. 

The Pokeweed Family (Phytolacracnir.t 

¦e have but one representative of this family of plants, namely 
keweed (Phyti&gt;l&lt;irrn decandra), a tall, branching herb, with a 
al root and annual stem. It is a smooth-leaved, strong-smelling

It is now found in the southeastern part of the state, and doubtless 
will gradually pass westward along with other alien species. It bears 
the nnnies Garget, Scoke and Poke in addition to Pokeweed, but the 
last is to be preferred. It has long been known to possess poisonous 
properties, but strange as it may appear the fresh shoots are used in 
some localities as a subtitute for asparagus- as a table delicacy. I 
siderable care must be exercised in the preparation of the shoots for 
food, no part of the root being taken, and at the same time the water 
in which the shoots are first boiled must be rejected on account of the 
poison contained in it.* Certainly the use of Pokeweed shoots for food 
can not be commended. The root is the most poisonous part, and canes 
are on record of fatal cases of poisoning from mistaking them for 
other fleshy roots. Ah indicated above the shoots are poisonous, and 
so are the berries (to a less degree), and the seeds. 

The Foub-o'clock Family (\yvtagimaceae). 

36. In old-fashioned gardens there are still to be seen the pretty 
plants to which the name of 'Four-o'clock' (MirabUit falapa) has been 
given in allusion to the habit they have of opening their flowers about 
four o'clock in the afternoon. These cultivated plants are natives of 
the warmer portions of America, hence one name by which they are 
known. — 'Marvel of l'eru.' They contain a purgative and emetic principle, 
and doubtless this indicates a poisonous action. The leaves are 
said to be capable of producing severe inflammation.! 

37. We have severnl species of related genera growing wild in 
braska. The most common of these is the Wild Four-o'clock (AlliomUt 
itpctaginea), a smooth, large-jointed plant which grows rampantly in 
rich soil and is regarded as a troublesome weed in some places. Its 
flowers are of a pretty pink color, and are about half an inch in 
diameter. They open in the afternoon, usually not far from four 
o'clock, and therefore the name by which they are known is quite 
proper. Some suspicion has been lodged against these plants, and I 
therefore include them in this list, although I am not able at the 
present time to determine whether they are actually poisonous or not. I

Sain for the most part an astringent principle, which has been 
! use of in medicine. The Docks (Rumrr. of several species) are 
known examples of this family, and these are freely used for food 
greens') and medicines (from their roots). The Water-peppers 
Heartseases (Poiygonum, of many species) contain tannin in such 
tities that one of the species (P. emertum) has been used in the 
fss of tanning. 

39. The Kriogonumx (Eriogonum, of several species) are often more or 
leas woolly plants with some general resemblance to the Heartseases, 
although some of the species are low with a few flowering stems springing 
from a woody root and a cluster of root-leaves. Our species grow 
in the central and far western portions of the state. In Montana they 
have been suspected of being poisonous to stock, but I am not aware 
that this has been confirmed by trial. Specimens have been sent to the 
Department of Botany from the northwestern part of the state with 
suggestion that they were poisonous. Clearly they need investigation. 
According to Halsted seeds of Sorrel (Rumix acetosella) are said 
t&lt;&gt; |&gt;. &gt;isoii horses and sheep.* 

40. The members of this tropical family of trees arid shrubs are 
pervaded with a bitter principle which is so marvellously intensified 
in the Quassia tree (Picraena eaeelsa) of Jamica. that its wood is used 
in medicine. However it is said to be poisonous to insect*. We have 
no native representatives of this family in Nebraska, but one member. 
the Ailanthus tree (Ailanthu* glandulom) of China, is commonly grown 
for its ornamental foliage. Dr. Rusby points outt that the roots, bark 
and leaves are very poisonous, and cites cases of persons who have 
suffered from drinking water in which the roots penetrated. 

The Nettle Family (Vrticaceae) . 

41. The plants of this family are well known on account of their 
stinging hairs which are found abundantly scattered over the surfaces 
of leaves and stems. Each hair is hollow, and the cavity is filled with 
an acrid fluid which produces a burning sensation with severe local 
inflammation, when applied to the skin. Our plants are species of two 
genera (Urtica and VrtioMtrum). To the first belong the Great Nettle 
[I rtica dioica), an Old World weed which has entered the eastern edge 
&lt;&gt;f the state, and the Slender Nettle (Urlica gracUit), a native plant 
which is widely distributed in the state. The first is very virulent, 
while the second is considerably less so. To the second genus belongs 
the Wood Nettle ( UrtUxutrum divaricatum) another virulent plant, second 
only to the Great Nettle. These plants deserve to be included in the 
list of external poisons.

t&gt;e avoided by persons who are susceptible to this poison. 

4«. The Croton* are hairy plants of this family, represented in our 
flora bjr the Texan Croton (Croton tt-muiti). a white-hairy, slendermed 
plant with narrow leaves and a spreading head of flowers at 
the summit. As the genus is known to include virulently poisonous 
s|&gt;e&lt;-ie8 it is probable that this one also possesses a toxic principle. It 
should be avoided. , 

47. The Cantor-oil Want (Hicinw coHimunig), a native of the Old World. 
much grown in this country for its oily seeds as well as for ornament, 
is actively poisonous. The seeds are prettily marked and are 
attractive to children, and many cases are on record of the death of 
children who have eaten them. Some years ago my attention was called 
•' fact that a number of horses were killed by eating the seeds 
wliirh were mixed with corn which had been brought to Lincoln from 
some place in Missouri where the Castor-oil Plant is fcrown for its oil. 

This family of pretty plants, mostly climbers, seems not to merit 
uspicion of being poisonous which it is necessary to cast upon it. 
The common Morning- Glory of the gardens (Ipomoea purpurca) is a 
good example of the family. I do not know of any complaint as to its 
¦•tag ]H&gt;isonoii8, but a near relative, the Man-of-the-Earth (Ipomiem 
pmmdurata) is included in Halsted's list of plants 'with somewhat poisoninderground 
parts.'* I have some reasons for suspecting that the 
ioted Morning Glory of 'the Plains (Ipomoea leptophplla) is some|&gt;oisonotis, 
but have not yet demonstrated it. 

One of the troublesome weeds of the cornfields in eastern Nebraska 
is the Wild Morning Glory (i'onrutvulux septum) which bears 
large white or slightly pinkish flowers, of the shape of those of the 
non Morning Glory. Kvery farmer knows about the long, white, 
-ground stems which are so abundant in a patch of these weeds. 
liownl that these troublesome steins have an additional 
bad quality, since they are 'quite poisonous to swine.'

The .Nightshade Family {Boianaceme). 

Blere we find some of the most useful food-plants, as the 1 
tm rnculrntum), Tomato (Lyeoperiicum lyropemirum) , and Egg-plant 
im mrlongma), along with dangerous poisons, as the Deadly ' 
(Kola Hum dulcamara). Belladonna (Atropa belladonna) and Henbane 

(Hpfcpamus niger). Certainly a 
family with such contrasts is a 
most interesting one. It is necessary 
in dealing with the species of 
these plants that we know quite 
certainly what ones we have in hand, 
or disastrous results may follow. 

The Black Nightshade i Solatium 
niorum) is one of the most common 
of our native weedy plants. It 
grows in yards and waste places, 
attaining a height of a foot or 
more, and branches so profusely 
that it spreads over a good deal of 
ground by the end of the year. It 
is an annual and so dies down at 
the end of the summer. Its flowers 
are white or bluish, and about one 
third of an inch in diameter (Fig. 
6). The berries are black and 
about one third of an inch in diameter. 
According to Chesnut* the 
plants are poisonous in all their 
part*, and the poison is an alkaloidlike 
substance named 'solanine.' It 
is not destroyed by boiling, and is 
not constant in amount in the 
plant. On account of this incon-

stancy in the amount of solanine grum), one-third natural size. (From 
in different parts of the plant we Chesnut, V. 8. Department Agriculture.) 
have conflicting reports in regard to the proper place of the plant. 
B.\ some the Itlack Nightshade is considered to be harmless, and the 
berries are eaten in pies and other pastry, while by others the plant 
oked upon as one to be shunned at all times, as poisonous. The 
fact is that poisoning does occur from eating the berries, and while 
cattle seldom eat the foliage, 'cases of poisoning are recorded for 
calves, sheep, goats, and swine.' In Nebraska while' the people in 
some places eat the berries, in other places the whole plant is looked 
upon as poisonous.

52. 1 he Spr r&lt;M inff I?iffht*h(i/ic 
(Solatium triflonm) is considerably 
like the preceding, but it 
is much more spreading, with 
little ability to stand upright. 
It differs also in its leaves which 
are much lobed. instead of being 
nearly or quite entire as in the 
Black Nightshade. The flowers 
are much like those of the Black 
Nightshade, but the berries are 
somewhat larger, and are somewhat 
flattened (Fig. 7). In some 
parts of the state the people use 
the l&gt;erries for food, as in pies, 
pastry, etc., apparently with 
no bad effects. Whether the immunity 
enjoyed by the eaters of 
these berries is due to mere 
'good luck' can not be decided 
at the present time, but I 
greatly fear that fatal cases may 
appear if such eating becomes 
common. Chesnut reports that 
'complaints of the poisoning of 
cattle have been sent in to the 
Department from Nebraska, and 
experiments on guinea pigs show 
that berries sent in from that 
state are poisonous. '•

The Mii.kweep Family (A*clrpiadaccac ). 

87. Here are the plants to which the name 'Milkweed' is properly ap'. 
although as already seen there are many other plants whirli 
have a milky juice. These plants have opposite leaves, and showy 
flowers of curious structure which produce large pods filled with silkplumed 
seeds. Many of them have long succulent underground stems 
by which they are able to pass the winter in safety, and on this account 
they are often weeds most difficult to eradicate. The milky juice, which 
is generally very abundant, has been reported to me as an irritant 
poison to some people. We have more than a dozen species, most of them 
members of the genus AackpUu. One of the most common is the Showy 
Milkweed (Axclepias tpeciosa), a large hairy plant with showy, pinkish 
flowers in a dense terminal cluster. In Montana it has been under 
suspicion, and some experiments made in that state show that there 
me ground for the ill repute in which it is held. In California a 
related species (A. eriocarpa) 'is especially dreaded by sheep men.'* 
Our Nebraska species need" careful investigation. 

The Figwobt Family (Scrophulariaceae). 

58. The plants of this family are distinguished by their flowers which 
have a gamopet&amp;lous two-lipped corolla, and a seed-pod containing 
many seeds. A poisonous principle is present in the family, and it is 
sufficiently strong in some cases to prove harmful, or even fatal. In 
the western part of the state there grows a low plant, the Bed Synthyris 
(Syntkgris rubra), with a purplish spike of flowers, which is followed 
by a much taller spike of seed-pods. In Montana this has been 
accused of being poisonous to stock. + but it must be confessed that the 
experiments do not prove the accusation. Some of the tests seem to 
indicate that some harm may follow the eating of the leaves. No re 
of .poisoning by this plant have been received from Nebraska. 

59. Halstedt includes the Culver's-Boot (Leptandra virgittfca) among 
the plants 'with somewhat poisonous underground parts.' As this plant 
grows rather commonly in Nebraska it will be well to be on our guard 
in dealing with it.

MM species is the Wild 
Black Cherry (Prvnus serotina 
(Fig 1 . 9), which is common in 
eastern Nebraska, and from 
thence eastward. Of it he says, 
'Poisoning is frequently caused 
in cattle by eating the wilted 
leaves from branches thrown 
-sly within their reach, 
&lt;&gt;r ignorantly offered as food. 
Children occasionally die from 
eating the kernels of the seed 
&lt;&gt;r by swallowing the fruit 
whole. The poison is formed 
in the leaves of detached 
branches by the chemical action 
of two non-poisonous subs 
which are present In 
the plant. Under certain conl 
these compounds liberrussic

most deadly poisons. The fresh 
leaves are generally considered

leaves are considered poisonous.' We have several other species in the 
state, namely, the Dwarf Wild Cherry (Prunut demitta) in central and 
cm Nebraska, and the Choke Cherry {Prunut virgimana) in the exo 
eastern part. The first is a shrub of not more than a few feet 
in height bearing large black cherries much like those of the Wild 
Black Cherry. It is so nearly related to the black cherry^that there 
can be no doubt as to the probability of its having the same poisonous 
properties. In regard to all of the species of the genus Prunus, 
Chesnut says 'the seeds of all varieties of cherries and plums, both 
native and introduced, are subject to suspicion; the flesh of none of 
pecies is in any way poisonous.'

ably poisonous to a .few people. I refer to the Strawberry, which produces 
a most unpleasant inflammation in those who are so unfortunate 
as to be affected. I have seen but few cases, and yet on inquiry I 
find that this peculiarity is not as rare as one might suppose. It seems 
quite odd to think of this luscious fruit as a poisonous one, and no 
Kail of my readers who are 'immune,' so to speak, and who may 
the strawberries they wish, will join me in thankfulness that 
h calamity has befallen us. I can not think of a more disa^reefirmity 
than one which would inhibit the eating of strawberries. 

The Sexxa Family (Caetalpiniaeeae) 

62. Until recently the plants 
of this family were placed in 
the Bean Family to be noticed 
next, but their flowers are not 
at all bean-flower like, although 
the pods resemble bean 
pods. The one plant which 
must be noticed here is the 
Kentucky Coffee Tree (Oymnorladus 
dioica), a large, unarmed 
tree which growB quite commonly 
in eastern and southern 
Nebraska. It may be distinguished 
by the fact that it produces 
large, even pods which 
hang from the tree long after 
the leaves have fallen (Fig. 10). 
The only other tree producing 
bean-like pods is the Honey 
Locust (dleditnia triacantkot), a. 
related, thorny tree which 
grows in nearly the same 
portions of the state. The two 
trees may be distinguished by 
the fact that the Coffee Tree 
has thick, straight, even pods, 
while the Honey Locust podn 
are thin, and very crooked. 
The Coffee Tree contains a

Ehis immense family contains a large number of plants which 
the greatest use to man, as beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, clovers, 
, alfalfa, sanfoin, vetches, besides many gums and medicines. 

When we think of the clovers, 
alfalfas and other related forage 
plants it seems improbable that 
a dangerous poison may lurk in 
some of the wild species. And 
vet this improbable thing is a 
well-established fact, and there 
are more poisonous plants, and 
those suspected of being so, in 
this family than in any other 
with which I am acquainted. Dr. 
Rusby has recently shown* that 
the common Locust-tree (Robinia 
pteudacacia) is poisonous as to 
its roots and bark, and perhaps 
also as to its flowers. He cites 
cases of fatal results to children 
who ate of the roots. 

M. The Loco-weed», proper, belong 
to the genus Astragalus and 
are common in the central and 
••rn states. They are mostly 
low plants, often woolly, and 
bear spikes of pretty flowers, 
resembling those of the peas 
and beans. The species to which 
attention has been mostly given 

Fig. 11. — Loco-weed (Attraotlmt mtoliuimmt). 

is the Astragalus mollissimus (Fig. ' '^ h 7 r i^ u W^ U a^. "TrW SZZ?&amp;. 
11), a plant about eight inches or S. Department Agricultare. ) 
a foot in height, with compound leaves composed of from nineteen 
to twenty-seven oval, obtuse, silky-hairy leaflets, and a spike of 
purple flowers. This, which may well be called the Common Loco-weti, 
is found throughout all but the extreme eastern part of Nebraska. It 
occurs in isolated clumps on the prairies, and is quite conspicuous, so 
that cattle and horses are no doubt attracted to it on this account. 
There has been much discussion in regard to the poisonousness of this 
plant, some experimenters asserting that it contains nothing harmful, 
and some that they have fed large quantities to animals without bad 
results, and yet the fact remains that the plant is poisonous. ( h.

¦ays of it: "The damage done to the live-stock business by this weed 
is immense.' There are sixteen other species of this genus growing 
wild in Nebraska, and while little is known as to their pnisonousneas, 
it is pretty certain that they will ultimately be found to possess the 

same qualities. 

65. The Crazy-wee&amp;t are related to the 
Loco-weeds, and in fact they are not generally 
distinguished from them. They belong, 
however, to another genus, namely. 
Arayallms, which differs from the Loco-weeds, 
proper, in having the front petals (keel) of 
the flower sharp-pointed, instead of blunt 
us Ihey are in the Loco-weeds. Otht-: 
the plants look much alike. There are many 
species of Crazy-weeds, but one of them has 
attained notoriety in Nebraska as a poisonous 
plant, namely, Aragallus lambertii (Fig. 
12). This is common from western Iowa to 
the Rocky Mountains, and resembles tin- 
Loco-weed described above, except that it 
is usually smaller, not so leafy, the leaflets 
are narrower, sharp pointed and less hairy, 
and the flowers are not as numerous on the 
spike, and are frequently much lighter 
colored, often being nearly white. Us 
poisonous action is quite similar to that of 
the Loco-weed. Our two other species 
probably possess the same properties. Other 
species in Montana are known to be poisonous 
to sheep and horses. 

68. The Rattle-box (Crotalaria sagittalit) is 
a spreading-hairy plant about a foot high.

f the state, where it sometimes covers considerable areas. Nearly 
y years ago my attention was first called to this plant as one 
contained a harmful principle, and at that time I witnessed an 
ment which indicated that poison is actually present in the green 
although 'the plants which were used were somewhat wilted. A 
horse was killed by being compelled to drink a quantity of water 
ch the green plants had been crushed.

genus Lupinus), and yet it has 
shown beyond question 
that some of the species are 
poisonous. In Montana, where 
they have been studied most 
.ral species have 
liven proved to be harmful to 
k.» While none of the 
Montana species referred to are 
found in Nebraska I have no reafor 
thinking that ours will 
prove to be otherwise than 
¦ nous. Our species are confined 
to the western portions of 
the state, where they should be 
it»d carefully. 

68. The White TumblctretdJS (spent 
Psoralta) are spreadingbranched, 
white-hairy plants 
growing on the prairies, and 
bearing scattered (less commonly 
spicate) flowers. The plants 
often break off in the fall and 
become 'tumbleweeds,' rolling 
over the prairies and thus scattering 
their seeds. One of our 
most widely distributed species 
is the Common White Tumbleicted 
(Ptoralea tenui/lora), and this has 
been studied in Montana! where

Its shown to contain a poisonous principle. It is probable that of 
nine other species some at least contain similar deleterious props, 
and the plants should be carefully watched. 

The Star-flower Family (Loataceae). 

Ke Star-flowers are erect, herbaceous plants with rough-pubeacent 
and terminal clusters of white or creamy, often large, starflowers. 
We have several species, one of which (Mentzelia

The Buckeye Family (HippocaJttanaceae).

tly acid berries when on my botanizing trips. 

72. The Poiton Ivy (Rhu* nidican*), 
a well-known climbing 
vine, is one of the most troublesome 
of plants poisonous to 
the touch. It grows throughout 
the state, and although so 
painful to so many people, it is 
not commonly distinguished 
from the harmless Virginia 
Creeper (Parthenon**** quinquefolia). 
Let it be remembered 
that the Poison Ivy has three 
leaflets in each leaf (Fig. 14), 
and that the Virginia Creeper 
has five. This fact will enable 
anyone to tell the harmless 
from the harmful plant. Much 
has been written in regard to 
the nature of the poison contained 
in these plants. At one 
time an investigator announced 
that the poisonous material 
consisted of certain virulent 
bacteria which entered the 
pores of the skin and set up a 
violent inflammation. Dr. Pfaff, 
of Boston, announced a few 
years ago that the active principle 
was a non-volatile oil

separating from the foliage. 

¦i now the generally accepted view, but it must be remembered 
lere are well-authenticated cases of poisoning tcithout contact, which 
scarcely occur if the sole agent of infection is non-volatile. I 
was once a victim of such poisoning without contact. An assist- </seg>

            <seg id="p029">

ant brought into my laboratory a tin box full of plants, among which 
were many flowering specimen* of the Poison Ivy. The day was hot. 
and the assistant had walked in the sun for a mile or more, in bringing 
in the plants. Knowing ray susceptibility to Poison Ivy poisoning he 
warned me not to touch the tin box or its contents. I therefore 
him to open the box while I looked on and selected the plants which I 
wished him to preserve for pressing. As the box wag opened I leaned 
"vit and looked in, being very careful not to come into contact with 
the box or the plants. As the assistant took up plant after plant I 
pointed to others and asked him in regard to the stations where he 
secured them. I was very careful, as I had been very severely poisoned 
many times before, and did not wish to have another experience of 
the discomfort. Yet in a day or two I found myself suffering with 
the usual inflammation, only the surfaces affected were those only 
which had been directly exposed when I leaned over the box of plants. 
My face was inflamed all over, except where my beard, mustache, eyebrows, 
and nose made projecting protections. Above these there were 
small areas entirely free from inflammation. The under side of my 
eyebrows (the 'overhang') was thoroughly poisoned, and so was the 
insiile of my nose (the nostrils). My right hand was severely poisoned, 
hut here again the distribution of the inflammation was peculiar, being 
confined to the parts which were directed doumicard as I pointed at the 
various specimens in the box. Thus the proximal and middle joints of 
the second, third and fourth fingers, and the under side of the wrist 
of that hand were badly affected, while the upper side of the hand was 
not |x&gt;isoned at all. My left hand was not poisoned, and I account 
for this by the fact that it was kept back and not used in indicating 
plants to be examined by the assistant. 

\s this matter of poisoning without direct contact has been and 
is still disputed by some people, I shall be greatly obliged for information 
in regard to cases of supposed poisoning in this way. 

The Parsley Family (Umbelliferae). 

74. The plants of this family are easily distinguished from all others 
by the fact that the flowers (which are small) are arranged in more 
or less flat-topped clusters, composed of radiating flower-stalks. In 
some cases these radiating stalks bear another set of still smaller 
stalks which are the ones which bear the flowers. Another thing 
which may enable one to be sure that the plant belongs to this family 
is the fact that the seed-pod is below the flower, and that it contains 
but two seeds. If these characters are taken together there need be 
no question as to the relationship of any plant of this family. They 
are all herbaceous, and mostly perennial, or at least biennial. Some 
of them furnish valuable food-plants, as the Parsnip, Carrot, and Celery, 
while others are used as condiments, as Coriander, Caraway, and 
Parsley. There is. hnwever. a dangerous poison in many of the species </seg>

            <seg id="p030">
122 


and it is probable that it is 
present to a less extent in all. 

75. Water Hemlock {Cicuta 
maculata) is a tall, smoothstemmed 
plant with more or 
less of purple streaking and 
spotting on its surface. It 
attains a height of three to 
eight feet, and the stem is 
hollow. The leaves are much 
divided, and the leaflets are 
sharply serrated on the margins 
(Fig. 15). The roots are 
fleshy and spindle-shaped, and 
each plant has several in a 
cluster. The small flowers 
are white, and are borne in 
flat-topped clusters at the 
summit of the plant. The 
whole plant is poisonous but 
the roots are the most virulent. 
This is probably the 
most deadly species of our 
flowering plants. It is likely 
that annually a considerable

76. WMte-flotcered Parti en 

(Lomatium nudicaule) a common low prairie plant with much-divided 
leaves, is known to be poisonous to stock.* The species of a related 
genus, Musenium, are suspected of possessing poisonous properties. The 
plants resemble those of the preceding species. 

The Honeysuckle Family (Caprifoliaceae). 

76o. Here we find many pretty and interesting plants, and it is quite 
unexpected that any should be charged with being poisonous. The 
Black Haw (Viburnum prunifolium), Sheepberry (F. lentago), High-lmsh 
Cranberry (V. opulut), are well-known edible berries, and the Snowball 
pvlus) and many kinds of Honeysuckles (species of Lonieerm), 
equally well-known ornamental plants. Yet here we find some dangerous 
poisons, as in the roots and bark of the Elder (8ambuou» canadetuit), 
and the roots of the Feverwort (Triotteum perfoliatum) . Both of these

h»ve been shown by Dr. Kusby* to be dangerously poiaonoua, and he 
cites a case where several children died from the effects of eating- the 
first under distressing circumstances. 

The Chicory Family (Cichoriaceae). 

Bthis family we have the bland and healthful Lettuce, the wholeidive, 
and the nutritious Salsify, all freely used as foods, as well 
&gt;andelion and Chicory, which supply 'greens' for those 'who Bke 
rt of thing.' The plants all contain a milky juice, and it is 
that in some cases this includes a narcotic principle. Perhaps 
it is on this account that in Montana and Utah the Prairie Pink 
(F.yg&lt;Hlrxui!d juncra) 'has been suspected by stockmen of being poisonous 
to stock. t This plant is common in Nebraska, and is a low, spreading, 
E*t leafless plant, bearing pretty pink-like flowers at the ends of the 
dies. I hare nut had any complaints from Nebraska in regard 
is plant. 

The Ragweed Family (Ambroniaceae). 

CHere we find some of our worst weeds, as the Ragweeds, Marsh 
rs, and Cockleburs. The plants are mostly coarse, and possess an 
acrid and bitter principle which makes them quite disagreeable to the 
taste. Here too according to Halstedt we have a poisonous plant of no 
mean importance, since he says 'the Cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) 
has had many cases of death among swine attributed to it.' After 
admitting that a part of the injury may be mechanical from the action 
of the barbed spines on the burs, and the impaction of the burs in the 
stomach, he continues, 'there are however instances upon record which 
indicate that, in addition to the impaction in the stomach, the cocklebur 
seed has strictly poisonous properties, reducing the action of the 
heart and causing death.' While I know of no case in Nebraska of any 
injury, it will be well for us to keep an eye on these unsightly weed*. 
We have here an additional reason for keeping them off from our farms. 

The Sunflower Family (Cnmpmitae). 

79. This is the largest family of flowering plants, there being fully 
ten or possibly eleven thousand species in existence. In Nebraska there 
are between one hundred and fifty and two hundred native species 
growing wild upon the prairies and the High Plains. To a great extent 
they are not harmful as far as poisonousness is concerned, although 
many are quite persistent and troublesome weeds. Within recent years 
attention has been called to the fact that some of the species are 
poisonous, and as some of these are natives of Nebraska it is proper 
that they should be noticed here. 

80. The Tall Cone-flower (Rudbeckia laciniata) is a perennial, much-

ten feet high, growing- in thickets 
and in the borders of woodhinds, 
and bearing heads of yellow 
flowers looking 1 much like 
those of many wild sunflowers. 
In Montana it has been shown 
pretty certainly to be fatally 
poisonous to sheep, and in Missouri 
it is said to be fatal ti&gt; 
swine.* The plant is common in 
nearly all parts of the state. 

hi. The sneezeweed (Helenlmm 
autumnale) is a late-flowering 
plant very common in all parts 
of the state. It is a branching 
plant, usually about two feet 
high, bearing lance-shaped, 
sharp-pointed leaves, and many 
pretty, yellow, terminal flowers 
(Kig. 16). According to Chesnutt 
the poison 'exists principally in 
the flowers,' and there appears 
to be more poison in mature 
than in the young plants. 'Sheep. 
cattle, and horses that are unfamiliar 
with the plant are often 
poisoned by it when driven to

in the state.

Herewith is presented for publication a paper dealing with inattacking 
fungi. It is intended that it Hhall take the place of 
1 report on insect enemies which has appeared from year to year 
in these pages. It was ray intention some time ago to present in¦ 
paper on the mammals of Nebraska. Owiag to unforeseen iliftVulthis 
mammal |&gt;a|&gt;er w;is not ready in lime, hence it must go over 
until next year. 

K present article was prepared by Mr. .1. L. Sheldon, a graduate 
in the Department of Entomology, also an instructor in lx&gt;tany, 
University of Nebraska. In his researches he has been working 
articularly along the line of the lower plants known as fungi. 

The reason for selecting this particular paper now is the promin 
which the subject of insect fungi has received during the past few 
- in connection with the destruction of several of our worst peats 
by means of diseases which result from the attacks of these plants. 
1 1 is hoped, therefore, that it will be of some use to the farmers of

SOME PLANTS WHICH LIVE UPON' AND IN INSECTS. 

BY JOHN L. SHELDOS. 

To say that plants live upon and in insects sounds like 'putting the 
cart before the horse,' for usually one thinks of insects as living and 
feeding upon plants. Almost everyone has noticed during the latter 
part of summer and in the autumn, the dead flies attached by their 
tongues to the walls of the house and to the window-panes, and also 
the dead grasshoppers clinging to the weeds and grass stems in such 
a way that they appear to have died from fear of either falling off 
or of being carried by a strong wind to a less favorable feeding ground. 
Various other insects are also found dead in considerable num 
It sometimes happens that an entire swarm of tn-es is destroyed within 
a short time and that silkworms that were eating ravenously and apparently 
in perfect health, become inactive and die within a few days. 

I examination of some of these dead insects shows that they are 
with a white cottony substance which breaks through their 
&gt; at the segments, while others have changed color and finally 
I without any visible cause. A few inserts, such as the 
which is the young stage of the May beetle, are occasionally 
with variously colored horn-like objects projecting out of their 
bodies. </seg>

The loss to the silk industry and to the bee raisers has brought about 

Ereful investigation of the diseases of the silkworm and bee in 
r to determine the cause of their wholesale destruction and to 
some means of preventing it. In the case of certain other insects. 

¦ grasshopper, codling moth, chinch bug. and the omnipresent 
fly for example, means for destroying them is of as much iroice 
as for protecting the silkworm and honey bee. 

a result these investigations have shown that the death of many 
ts is caused by plants which live inside of them and which feed 
upon them. Plants living after thiR manner are known as fungi. 
Instead of obtaining their food from the soil and air like the sunflower 
and the corn, they get it either from living plants and animals 
or from dead ones. Other familiar examples of the fungi are the 
toadstools, the mildews, and the moulds. 

The Bacteria. 

Besides the toadstools, mildews and moulds, plants which are mostly 
large enough to be seen easily, there are other plants similar to them 
in their manner of obtaining food, but so exceedingly small that it is 
, difficult to see them even with the aid of the most powerful 
microscopes. 

DC of these plants are often very beneficial to us; they assist 
in preparing the soil for our cultivated plants, in dairying, in the 
manufacture of vinegar, and in many other ways. There are others, 
however, which cause some of our most dreaded diseases like cholera, 
typhoid and yellow fever, lock-jaw, diphtheria, anthrax, consumption 
and blackleg. Not only persons and the domestic animals are at• 
il by these plants, but insects as well. Diseases like those just 
mentioned are ordinarily Raid to be caused by germs which in reality 
are minute plants, called by the botanists bacteria. 

Bacteria occur almost everywhere, but owing to their smallness it 
try difficult to see and study them. There are some so small that 
nild require 25,000 of them placed end to end to make one inch. 
it is that such small plants are capable of causing so much harm 
is not generally very well understood. The presence of a few of the 
most destructive disease-producing kinds would not be noticed, but 
when they occur in large numbers is when they become dangerous. 

Bacteria, in general, are colorless, appearing whitish when mil fd 
together in colonies; they are spherical, rod-shaped and spiral in form, 
are provided with delicate hair-like projections by means of 
which they are able to move about. The method by which new bacteria 
are produced is very simple when compared with that of the 
seed-producing plants. In the ordinary growing state, when food is 
abundant and the proper conditions of heat and moisture are maintained, 
the bacteria lengthen out and gradually divide crosswise, in 
this way, forming two from one. The two new bacteria divide again. </seg>

            <seg id="p041">

bo that in the course of a few hours a single bacterium may have produced 
several thousands. 

Ee some weed seeds, bacteria may remain dormant for long ythe 
conditions necessary for their growth return they iinmcdibeeome 
active. Seeds of the coekle-bur, ragweed and sunflower 
lie in the ground for a year or more without germinating, but 
the soil is stirred up and they begin to feel the influence of the 
ine and air, the seedling* burst from their seed coats and push 
way up through the soil, apparently all the more vigorous on 

account of their long rest. 

Contagious diseases caused by bacteria are brought about by the 
bacteria being carried in some way from one person or animal to another, 
and in the case of insects, from one insect to another. One of 

Fio. 2. — Silkworms at the spinning period

the contagious diseases of the silkworm caused by bacteria is called 
"jaundice" on account of the characteristic yellow color of the worms. 

Probably the most destructive disease is flaccidity, or flackerie, where 
the worms become limp and flabby; it has been noticed to some extent 
in the United States and is often very troublesome in Europe. Prof. 
C. V. Riley describes it in a bulletin issued by the United States Department 
of Agriculture as follows: "When, after the worms have 
passed their fourth moult, and are eating well and regularly, they have 
all the appearance of perfefct health and vigor, and the silkraiser feels 
full confidence in the success of his crop, some will often be seen to </seg>

I I to the edges of the traye. and lie there without motion. But 
fur tin' lo.-s of their wonted activity nnil the cessation of their 
voracious appetite, one would think the worms in perfect health, for 
they yet retain all their outward perfection of form that we have 
remarked almve. In color, they have, perhaps, become somewhat more 
¦cially if the d m a violent form. On touching them, 
however, we find them soft, anil even in this seemingly live condition 
they are dead. • * • A fre— drop appears at the mouth and the 
worm secretes a dirty fluid which suils the anal orifice and gradually

¦ it."' liefore many hours the skin begins to shrivel; later it 
brown, then black, and the whole worm is soon in an advanced 
• f putrefaction. 

The common cabbage worm is subject to the same disease. The 
natural color of the cabliagc worm is a liffht green, but when attacked 
by fliwherii it commences to turn pale until the color is almost a milky 
white, then to a sooty ftmjr at or just before death. With the exception 
of color, the symptoms are much the same as those described for 
the silkworm. The disease is very eoatafiona, and soon most of the 
lire worms in a tfiven locality lie from it. The worms spread 
the disease ;,s thev crawl about frmn one place to another. Fhi' '

bug. completely filling the inside and causing it to slowly starve by 
absorbing the vital fluids of the body. When the fungus is ready to 
fruit it breaks through the outer covering at the joints. Small^rounc 
bodies (spores) form on the ends of the filaments, singly or in masses, 
and when mature fall off and are scattered about. If one of the spores

happens to come in contact with a healthy bug, and the conditions for 
germination are favorable, a small filament from the spore pushes 
through the outer covering into the bug's body. When once inside 
where food is plentiful, the filament begins to branch and soon fills 
the interior. The diseased bugs leave the plants upon which they fee&lt; 
and move restlessly about for a time, or until they find a cool, moist

plant, where they die. 

The same fungus attacks the cicada or seventeen year locust, the 
grasshopper and one of the flies. 

The Fi.y Fungus (Kmpuna). 

There is another fungus called Empusa which attacks the chinch bug. 
differs from Sporotrichum in that it is grayish or brownish instead 
of white, and gives the bugs the appearance of being covered with 
minute beads. The common house fly is the greatest sufferer, al-

hough bugs, butterflies, beetles, 'plant lice, grasshoppers and bees 
re not immune. It is the cause of the disease called "fly cholera." 
The sick flies become restless and weak from the fact that the fungus 
s constantly absorbing the blood and fluids of the body that would 
therwise give them food and strength; they finally attach themselves 
&gt;y their tongues to the wall of buildings and to the window panes 
where they are found suspended. The spasmodic jerkings of their 
wings and legs would seem to indicate that they suffer intense pain 
during the death struggle. After death the body swells, bursts open, 
and a whitish substance protrudes from between the segments. The 
body is at length covered with a halo of white filaments. Spores are </seg>

thrown off from the ends of the filaments and may be distinctly seen 
on a mirror or window pane as a ring around the dead fly. Flies are 
such social and inquisitive creatures, as well us very active, that it is 
an easy matter for them to get the spores attached to them and in 
iv take the disease. 

Besides the spores which are produced outside of the body are thickwalled 
ones produced on the inside. These spores are formed by the 
union of certain parts of two filaments, and serve the purpose of carrying 
the fungus over from one year to the next. These so-called resting 
spores are so abundant that the inside of the body looks as if filled 
with small granules. After a while the spores fall out through the

One peculiarity of the disease caused by Kmpnxn is the tendency of 
the insects to climb upon some object rather than to seek some damp 
place near the ground as mentioned by those attacked by Sporotrirkum. 
Grasshoppers attach themselves to grass and weed stems by tightly 
grasping them with their first and second pairs of legs. The tendency 
to climb is so marked that a kind of cricket which ordinarily lives 
under stones and decaying logs in the wood, when inoculated with 
the fungus, also climbed up on an object several feet where it died. 

Another fungus which is attracting considerable attention at the 
present time on account of its supposed value as a means lor killing

grasshoppers is the South African locust fungus. Of how much value 
it really is for this purpose has yet to be determined. 

In appearance the fungus does not differ from the ordinary black 
mould that is altogether too common on stale bread, vegetables, etc.. 
except that it is somewhat smaller. It is, in fact, a small black mould. 
The fungus is not black but the fruits are rather dark. When it is 
voung, it consists of a mass of slender white tubes or filaments which

the same way that the long canes of raspberries bend over and take 
root and send up new canes, or the runners of strawberries take root 
and form new plants. From the places where the root-like procesMa </seg>

abort time the fungus spreads over a considerable space. Another 
kind of filament is produced on the fungus, which instead of lying 
nearly flat, stands upright. Upon these latter filaments are borne the

spores to escape. The spores become attached to the grasshopper in 
some way and after germinating the filaments of the fungus begin 
to feed upon the grasshoppers. The spore fruits are sometimes borne 
singly on the filaments, but usually the filaments branch and the spore 
fruits are borne on the ends of the branches. The grasshoppers at-

!i&gt;bably the most conspicuous fungus which lives in insects and one 
h attracts attention on account of its size, peculiar shape and 
lional bright color, is Cordyctpg. It attacks all orders of six-legged 
its and certain of the spiders, producing what is termed "vegetable 
ut." This fungus, in one of its fruiting stages, covers the insect 
a white growth of filaments similar to Sporotrickum, in fact it 
been mistaken for Sporotrickum. This is the much more common 
i and has been given the name Imtria. 

ghe second fruiting stage, the fungus grows inside the grub of 
ay beetle or other insect until it is ready to fruit, when one or 
club-shaped bodies, often several inches long, grow outside. Inhese 
club-shaped bodies are numerous small pockets containing 
lied with long slender spores. At maturity the spores leave the 
ind escape to the ground through small openings in the club-1 
bodies. Just how the filaments from these spores gain an 

t trance into some insect is probably not definitely known, but pos&gt;ly 
by becoming attached to it as it crawls over the ground. </seg>

REPORT OF THE ENGINEER 

BT O. V. P. STOUT, C. E. 

Kmain feature of this report will l&gt;e. as it has been for m 
a statement in tabular form of the results of stream m. 
in Nebraska which have been conducted by the writer under 
&gt;ervision of Mr. F. H. Newell, ohief hydrographer of the I 
Geological Survey. The cordial co-operation of the State Board 
Ration, under the direction of Mr. Adna Dobson, Secretary and 
Ingineer, has continued. 

A gratifying feature of the year's work in 1901 has been the preatly 
increased demand for information concerning the streams at Nebraska. 
Requests for this information have come for the most part from pa 
located at the financial centers of the country who have had under 
consideration the advisability of investments in (Miwer or irrip.i 
developments on the streams of this state. The fact that we have 
records on the principal streams covering the op. | of from 
five to seven years makes it possible in most cases to respond fui 
such requests. 

Cpon reviewing the records for the years 1895 to 19&lt;M) inclusi 
appeared that it would assist in forming a correct appreciation of the 
capacity of some of the principal streams of Nebraska if a comparison 
were made of some of those streams with some of the most celebrated 
irrigation streams in the states to the west of us. For this purpose 
the North Platte river at Camp Clarke, Nebraska, and the Loop river 
at Columbus, Nebraska, were selected and placed in comparison with 
the Arkansas river at Canon City, Colorado, and the Cache a la Poudre 
near Fort Collins, Colorado. The figures for the comparison were 
taken from the reports of the state engineers, the data having beeu 
obtained originally for the most part by the Tinted States theological 

Ps found that for the five months from May to September inwhich 
are selected because the records for those months are 
ly all cases complete, the ratios of maximum to niininiui&gt; 
for the month are in each case a* set forth in the foil' 

Ratio of Maximum Monthly Discharge to Minimum Monthly l&gt;i*rhnrn&gt;.

That is to say, for instance, that during the five years under conideration 
the total discharge of the Loup river during the month of 
lay in the year of highest water for that month was 1.41 times what 
t amounted to during the same month in the year of lowest water 
n May. The figures in the table emphasize the remarkable uniformity 
n the rate of discharge of the Leup, the extreme variations of the 
North Platte, and the intermediate positions in this respect which 
re occupied by the Colorado streams. 

During the seven months, April to October inclusive, of the six 
seasons included in the comparison the discharge of the North Platte 
was sufficient to have covered each year on the average an area of one 
and two-thirds million acres to a depth of one foot. The corresponding 
figures for the Loup are one and one-fifth million acres, for the 
Arkansas a little less than half a million acres, and for the Poudre 
nearly 360.000 acres, somewhat in excess of one-third of a million acres. 
In other words, the relative supplying capacities of these streams, as 
indicated by the records at hand, and taking the Poudre as unity, are 
1.000. 1.193, 3.347 and 4.632 for the Poudre, Arkansas, Loup and North 
Platte respectively. 

It is not to be construed that the figures given constitute in any 
degree a reflection on the value or capacity of the Colorado streams. 
Their value has been demonstrated beyond question. The Poudre has 
been and is the sole basis of the prosperity of the entire cemntry in 
the vicinity of Greeley and Fort Collins, a region with a.s wide and well 
earned a reputation for productiveness as may be found on this slope. 
The Arkansas has done equally well in its field. The showing before us 
simply demonstrates the wonderful possibilities, so far as water supply 
is concerned, which the Nebraska irrigator has at his disposal.

THE QUANTITY OF WATER USED IN IRRIGATION. 

In addition to the work for the United States Geological Survey, the 

results of which have been set forth, the writer has had charge of 

some measurements and records in Nebraska which have been directed 

to the determination of the amount of water used in irrigation. The 

amount of water required for the irrigation of crops has been ex- 

pressed in various ways. One of the most common has been a state- 

ment of the determined or estimated area of land for which a continu- 

ous flow of one cubic foot per second throughout the irrigating season 

will suffice. This method of reckoning has been embodied in the 

irrigation laws of a number of states. Par instance, the statutes of 

Nebraska provide that rights to the use of water shall not be granted 

in an amount exceeding one cubic foot per second for each seventy 

acres irrigated. Another method which has l&gt;een used, and which it is 

believed admits of more precision in measurement and affords a better 

basis for analysis of results, is that which expresses the amount of 

water used in terms of the depth to which it would cover the land to 

which it was applied. A convenient relation to bear in mind, for the 

purpose of converting the results expressed according to one system 

of measurement into corresponding values, in the other system, is that 

one cubic foot per second flowing for twenty-four hours amounts very 

t 

nearly to a depth of two feet over one acre or of one foot over two 

acres. The term acre-foot is used to denote the amount of wateri 

required to cover one acre one foot deep. </seg>

Investigations were undertaken in the valley of the North I' 
river in 1899. These related to an areu a little more tlia'n U.ixhi 
in extent which was watered by canals diverting water from the 
Platte river at points between dering and Camp Clarke. Hay was 
grown on 58 per cent, of this area, alfalfa on 16 p«-r cent., onwheat 
on 14 per cent., and corn on 9 per cent. The balance of the 
area produced barley, millet, trees and garden. An examinatio 
the records as they relate to the operations under the indii 
canals shows that according to the data secured the amount of * 
which was applied to the fields, together with that which 
by evaporation and seepage between the point of measurenien 
the fields, and with that which may have been in some oas' 
and returned to the river, was sufficient to have covered the flel 
depths ranging from one and one-half feet to a little more than five 
feet. In the ease of one of the canals, under which about one-fourth 
of the acreage was alfalfa, and in connection with which one of the 
beat records was obtained, it was found that the amount of water 
in irrigation during the period from June 6 to September 21 was 
cient to have covered the irrigated fields to a depth of 1.89 feet. The 
estimate of 5.1 feet of water used in irrigation is made in conne. 
with a canal from which it was impossible to obtain complete re&lt; 
and hence is not to be accepted as conclusive. The rain which fell 
during the season of record upon the area under investigati" 
estimated from the weather bureau records for the stations at Qering 
6 Camp Clarke. On the basis of these records it has been estimated 
the irrigation was supplemented by rainfall to the extent of an 
»ge depth of 0.98 feet over the ground. 

The expense of obtaining these records was borne by the Nebraska 
Agricultural Experiment Station, and the detailed results have been 
published in Bulletin No. 86 of the Office of Experiment Stations of the 
United States Department of Agriculture. 

In 1900 and 1901, under the direction of Professor Elwood Mead, in 
charge of the irrigation investigations of the 1'nited States Department 
of Agriculture, records were kept to some extent of operations under 
the Great Eastern Canal, whieh diverts the water of Beaver Creek near 
Genoa, Nebraska, and carries it as far as a point several miles east 
of Columbus. This canal is the farthest east of any irrigation canal 
of considerable magnitude in the country. Consequently the r&lt; 
obtained by irrigation from that canal should have a peculiar late 
The canal is located in a region of country in which men have made 
comfortable fortunes in a few years by the practice of agriculture 
without irrigation. The Imrden of proof under such circumstance* is 
upon the irrigation canal to justify its existence. The investignhave 
not as yet progressed far enough to permit of the presentation 
in large volume of striking figures on this point. The indications are, 
however, very favorable to the case of the canal. In 1901 crop failure </seg>

prevaih-d in that region so far as crops other than those "f early 
maturity were concerned. Irrigated corn, however, returned full yields. 

As to the amount of water used, a register which m maintained at 
a point past which water flowed to irrigate 2.25."&gt; acres in 1900 indi. 
that the water which passed the point between the dates July 14 and 
August 17 was sufficient to have covered the land to u depth of 1.185 
feet A register was in service at the sauie point from May lit to 
September 7 inclusive in 1901. and indicated that during that period the 
recorded wster was equal to a depth of 2.343 feet over the 2,509 acres 
which it irrigated. From July 14 to August 17 in 1901 the estimated 
depth applied was 1.253 feet, differing by less than one inch from the 
amount for the corresponding period of 1900. 

Registers were in some instances maintained at the edges of the 
fields. In one instance it was found that ITi acre-feet of water was 
applied to 86.81 acres of very poor sandy land, south of Oconee. between 
the dates June 27 and August 1 in 1900. This corres|xni:ls to tin 
average depth of 1.97 feet over the ground. The crops were raise" 
mostly for seed, and consisted largely of sweet corn and squash. The 
tof irrigated squash was 113 pounds of seed per acre. A field of 
* which was not irrigated yielded 56 pounds of seed per acre. The 
of water applied to the squash patches averaged approximately 
feet. The yield of irrigated sweet corn, 48.7 acres, averaged 15.2 
Is of seed per acre, while 30.82 acres not irrigated yielded at the 
if a little less than six bushels per acre. 

Another farm, which consists in part of a reclaimed swamp, was 
deroted to the raising of seed crops. In 1900 the vine crops suffered 
jreat damage from rains in the early fall, while in 1901 the only tinfavorable 
feature aside from drouth was the ravages of squash bugs. 
Two varieties of squash in 1901 yielded at a rate about 70 per cent, in 
excess of the average in 1900. while another variety, which had l&gt;een 
the especial prey of the bugs, yielded at only about one half the rate 
which prevailed in 1900. The average rate of yield of cucumber »eed 
in 1901 was greater by one-third than that in 1900. The depth of water 
applied to the several patches ranged in 1900 from O.ill feet to LT8 feet. 
and in 1901 from less than an inch to 1.62 feet. The maximum J 
were, in the case of squash seed, an average of 486 pounds per acre on 
2.23 acres, being nearly equalled by a yield of 432 pnuntis per acre on 
acres: and in the case of cucumber seed an average yield of 282 
pounds per acre on 11.01 acres.

No. 104 of the Office of Experiment Stations of the I'nited States Department

SORUHl'M POISONING OF CATTLE* 

The experiment with sorghum to determine the cause of death from 
entile running in sorghum fields was undertaken by the Department 
of Vnimal Pathology during- the summer of 1901 as the result of nuraerimniirics 
which came to the Station asking for remedies and 
reporting deaths of animals that had been pastured on sorghum or 
had broken into sorghum fields. In most cases these animalR did not 
regularly pasture upon sorghum, but broke into the fields from adjacent 
pastures or as they were being driven past fields of sorghum. 
Inw-stigation proved that the animals did not die from bloat as has 
been reported by many agricultural papers. Many cases were reported 
where death occurred without bloat and in so short a time that no 
other theory except that of poison seemed tenable. In most instances 
where losses of this kind were reported, the sorghum had been stunted 
in its growth and was not entirely healthy and vigorous in its appear- 

S visited many fields where animals had died, but generally found 
animals in so advanced a stage of decomposition that satisy 
post mortems roulil not be held. Often the animals had been 
, and when other animals were turned into these fields they 
d to eat the sorghum and no information could be secured. 

¦vsis of sorghum from many of these fields, in the laboratory, 
to show any poisonous principle in the sample, which had neeesbeen 
cut several hours before it could be submitted to a chemami 
nation. 

Eie spring of 1001. special effort was made to further the investiof 
sorghum poisoning. A notice was placed in the leading 
to the effect that the Experiment Station would send a 
to investigate all cases of so-called sorghum poisoning, if 
i in time to be of assistance or to secure any information. We 
ile&lt;t to numerous calls of this kind, but in most instances where 
s were turned upon the sorghum for the express purpose of 
ng them they refused to eat, and no data could be secured. 

In response to one of these calls, received through Dr. W. A. Thomas. 
State Veterinarian, I reached the farm of Mr. Foss. near Aurora, at 
7:30 a. m. on August 3, 1901. Two days previous, fifteen head of his 
• had broken into a sorghum field, where they had rem;i

twenty nbiate*. They were driven into another field and were not 
seen again for several hours. When seen, three were sick, all of which 
died within a few hours. The symptoms were drowsiness, running 
at tht eves, twitching of the muscles, numbness of the limbs, staggernnimal 
could not stand, involuntary passing of urine. On 
two more cows broke through the. fence and were on the 
urn field fire minutes. One hour later one of these animals, a 
four-ye::r-old cow. was very sick, but finally recovered. The animal

on the morning of August 3, when I arrived at the farm. 

turned a small yearling steer on the sorghum at 8:30 a. m., but 
he refused to eat any sorghum, and after thirty-five minutes two more 
animals were turned into the sorghum, where they remained until 10 
n. m.. when only one. a small red steer, had taken any- sorghum, and 
ha had eaten only a few leave*. They were then turned back with 
the nerd. At 10:3." a. m. the red steer acted somewhat drowsy, but 
soon recovered. 

At 11 a. in. we turned one red heifer and one yearling steer on the 
hum. The heifer was the only animal that ate any quantity, and, 
a* subsequent examination showed, she ate only one and one-half 
d« of green sorghum. At 11: 10 a. m.. this animal dropped to Hm 
ground. Upon close examination it was found that she had stopped 
nig her cud and there was a peculiar twitching of the nn: 
of the nose and head and alM&gt; of the IhmIv. The animal was very dull. 
At 11:19 she was taken out of the sorghum field and allowed to lie in 
ibbte held. When lying- down her head was turned toward the 
presenting the symptoms of a horse having" the colic. The 
•C4 If d dull and gave off a watery discharge. There was a partial 
paralysis of the tongue and great quantities of saliva running from 
louth. The limbs nnd ears were cold. The pupils of the 
ed. pulse noi perceptible, mucous membrane of the rectum protruding, 
iiivoluutary discharge of urine and feces. I pon pricking the 
:il with a knife on the lower limbs it showed no feeling. This 
walched in the field by Mr. Foss and myself and we 
hit that she did not take any weeds, but simply a small amount 
wghuin, eating only the tops of the leaves. At 1:30 p. m. the 
il was still lying on its right sirle. all the muscles of the head 
contracted and showed involuntary twitching. The limbs were 
paralzyed and the animal was unconscious; the mucous membrane of 
the aoutb wa&gt; of a salmon color. At '_'::(."&gt; p. m. the animal was in 
pain, ami it was apparent that she would not recover. At the 
i of Mr. Koss the animal was killed in order to hold a | 
mortem examination.

leaven to be found in the paunch. Xo sourness of the contents. The 
was immediately put up in Mason fruit jars with clean water 
anil brought to the laboratory. The blood had a peculiar odor like 
that of mint (?&gt;. It coagulated slowly. The mucous membrane of 
the intestines normal, and all other conditions of the animal normal. 
particular examination of the pharynx (throat), epiglottis, and 
esophagus and found that there were no leaves lodged over the same. 
If this had occurred tin- animal would have died instantly and not 
within three or more hours, as our record shows, and would hare died 
in the state of asphyxia and not presenting- the symptoms of arute 
poisoning. In the eleven post-mortems that we conducted, careful 
want has always failed to reveal any leaves obstructing the pharynx, 
epiglottis, or esophagus, which would have caused death by asphyxia 
or strangulation. We brought two jarsful of the leaves taken from 
the field where the animal died, and took them to the laboratory for 
chemical examination, which is not yet complete. 

One case of sorghum poisoning is reported from sorghum that had 
bam cut several hours before feeding. Mr. E. F. Stoner, of (h« 
cut sorghum at 8 o'clock p. in., August 2, which was fed to three niil&lt;-h 
- at 8 a. m.. August 3. About 9 o'clock a. m. these animals were 
first noticed to be sick. One died within an hour and fifteen mi' 1 
The other two recovered within twelve hours. On August 6 I vi 
this sorghum field and made an examination of the sorghum, which 
was not fully matured. It was comparatively free from weeds. At 
we placed a cow in this sorghum field and allowed it to eat as 
much cut sorghum as it would, up to 8 p. m., when it had consumed 
about twenty pounds. At 7 a. m.. August 7, the animal showed no 
of sorghum poisoning, and no bad effects followed. 

CAUTION. 

While a number of animals have died from sorghum poisoning in 
various fields, they constitute only a small percentage of the animals 
that have been pastured on sorghum each season. So far as our records 
go, they indicate that if animals are poisoned from eating sorghum 
it occurs when they are first turned in the field and it is not likely to 
follow after they have been on the pasture some days. It would therefore 
seem safe to turn a single animal upon the sorghum for a few 
hours and if it does not suffer any bad effects it will be safe to turn 
in the balance of the herd, (are must be taken in this case to observe 
that the animal turned in actually eats some of the sorghum, as 
\erv often true that an animal taken out of a herd and turned into 
a strange field does not eat on account of its strangeness under the 
new conditions. 

t investigation of this subject is not complete, and the work will 
&gt;secuted during the coming season in an effort to determine 
tely the cause of this disease. A large nuirber of chemical anal- </seg>

            <seg id="p062">
154 


jrses have already been made and many analyses remain to be completed. 
In this work, which ha« been carried on by the Department 
of Chemistry in conjunction with the Department of Animal Pathology, 
the Chemical Department has been able to separate certain vegetable 
enzym.- from sorghum. 

SORE MOUTH OF CATTLE. 

During the last two years our attention has been called to a disease 
which is very troublesome to stockmen. The first characteristic symptom 
is lagging behind in the pasture. Examination of the mouth shows 
profuse salivation, and ulcers on the upper and lower lips, gums, 
tongue, and nose. The tongue is usually affected to a marked degree, 
and the animal has a high fever. Especially is the dental pad against 
which the incisor teeth rest very noticeably affected. In some run 
when animals are not seen every day in the pasture, symptoms of advanced 
stapes will be found where the tongue protrudes, is very much 
swollen, has become dry and cracked, and very sensitive to the touch. 
It is also decolorized in these canes and therefore sometimes called 
"wooden tongue." This name is entirely wrong. The lips, tongue, and 
bom are usually covered with a dark chocolate colored crust, and in 
advanced stages the nasal chambers also become affected. Frequently 
in cases where the mouth and nose are affected the feet also show 
symptoms of an eruption which in most cases is confined to the deepructures 
of the pastern joints. In a number of cases the 
iet band is swollen, sometimes suppuration takes place at the heel, 
and very often a small ulcer is also seen in the dewclaw between the 
two hoofs. In this case, the animal's locomotion is very much impaired. 
It presents the symptoms, in many instances, of acute rheumatism, and 
if the mouth is also affected, the animal will rapidly lose flesh. The 
diseased mouth has been the most common form seen in affected herds. 
In milch cows the quantity of milk is gradually lessened. This disease 
bas occurred in herds on fine pasture as well as in pastures where the 
was somewhat scarce. It usually runs its course in from fourteen 
to eighteen days if no remedy is used. The symptoms are somewhat 
eljr allied to those of foot and mouth disease, the only difference 
is that it i.s not so contagious and is devoid of other characteristics of 
'id mouth disease. 

The following treatment is recommended: If the animals became 
affected on the pasture and the mouth only is diseased they should immediately 
be taken to the stable and given plenty of food, and the 
mouth thoroughly washed out once a day with a three per cent, solution 
of any of the coal-tar preparations on the market to-day, such as 
chloro-naptholeum. zenoleum. and the Lincoln disinfectant. After 
thorough washing with any one of these antiseptics, the mouth should 
be washed once a day with a five per cent, solution of alum water. The </seg>

            <seg id="p063">
155 


animals should be kept in the stable until the affected parts are 
thoroughly healed, which soon happens when treatment is offered. A 
number of animals which were very badly affected received no treatment, 
except that an abundance of feed was provided for them in 
racks on account of the animal not being able to graze by reason of 
the severity of the disease. If these precautions are taken the loss 
from death will be practically nothing. When the feet are affected they 
should also be washed with the above solutions, or, if there should be 
none of these at hand, a three per cent, carbolic acid solution will be 
very beneficial, afterwards anointing the parts with vaseline, twenty 
parts, and carbolic acid one part. This treatment has given the very 
best results. Thus far this disease has been confined to cattle, there 
having been no instances in which it was transmitted to other animals 
or to human beings. 

KIDNEY DISEASES IN HORSES. 

This disease is peculiar to the horse, as I am not aware of its occurring 
in any other animal. The most characteristic features are the 
sudden prostration of the animal, their inability to rise when they are 
down, spasms of the muscles of the hip and loins, and the discharge of 
high-colored urine, which is also very thick. This disease invariably 
6ws exercise after a period of enforced idleness. In some localities 
disease is also called the "Monday morning disease." It seems to 
r in all ages and breeds and in both sexes. Some writers state that 
find it more in the half-bred than in the thoroughbred. 

CAUSE. 

P cause of this disease is said to be due to idleness, high feeding 
xercise after a period of rest. There have been numerous theories 
iced in regard to the cause of this disease. Some have said the 
was at fault, other writers attribute it to the skin and kidneys, 
otners to the nerves. I think the German theory the best. They claim 
that the increased amount of nitrogen comes from the muscles, doe to 
irritation of the nerves, producing tissue changes, too much nitrogenous 
foods and no exercise. As stated above, this disease is usually met 
with in animals that have been allowed to be idle for sometime. Usually 
during the holidays and during the winter months, when the animals 
are being fed up for the spring work, it is not uncommon to see this 
disease attack the horses in the spring, when the farmer needs them the 

SYMPTOMS. 

The animals may be in high spirits when they are first taken out of 
the stable and driven for a short distance. In some cases the animals 
may be driven for several miles before they show any symptoms, but 
usually it is only a short distance before the animal seems to hang 
back and show stiffness of the loins. In this stage it is often taken for </seg>

            <seg id="p064">
156 


an attack of indigestion and very often is treated for a case of colic. 
The symptoms may be that of lying down and getting up, every attempt 
bringing on more violent struggles. It is usually seen in animals that 
are in the best of condition. As the disease progresses one can detect 
it from that of a case of colic. The animals, will break out in a profuse 
E'at and seem to be in great pain. If in this condition they are kept 
moving they will finally fall down, and it will be almost impossible 
jet them on their feet again. 

PREVENTIVE TREATMENT. 

Animals should have moderate exercise continually and when not in 
use be fed occasionally some laxative food. It should always be borne 
in mind when they are in the stable not at work there is always danger 
of overfeeding them, which produces this disease. However, if this 
disease should manifest itself in the animal while on the road or at 
work, it is of great importance, no matter where the animal be, that 
he be stopped before going any farther and give him perfect rest for 
several hours. This, in a great many cases, will prevent a severe attack. 
If, however, the animal should show symptoms after a rest for an hour 
or two (t is advisable to lead him and make him as comfortable as 
possible. Give him at this time a mild laxative food. 

TREATMENT. 

There is no remedy that has given universal satisfaction. Most all 
practitioners have their own line of treatment. However, it is always 
advisable to call in a competent veterinarian if you are fortunate to 
have one near by. If there is none available the first step would be to 
draw the urine. This can be done by inserting a catheter into the 
bladder. If this is not done and the animal struggles there is danger 
of rupturing the bladder. The urine should be drawn every two hours. 
If the animal cannot be gotten up on his feet hot blankets applied to 
his back are beneficial, or bags of oats dipped in hot water applied to 
the loins are good. If the animal while down is struggling it is preferable, 
if it can be done, to put it in a sling. If the hot blankets 
cannot be applied to the loins and back, then it is advisable to apply a 
liniment. Any of the common liniments that would not be too severe 
would be indicated. 

In the way of medicinal treatment, I would suggest for those cases 
that come on very suddenly. Dr. Law's prescription: A dose of bromide 
of potassium, four drams, and sweet spirit of nitre, one ounce: 
there may also be an advantage in giving a full dose of aloes, from 
five to six drams, in very severe cases. 

Kmust be taken that if animals should be taken down in very 
and disagreeable places, that they be removed to dry quarters, 
seems to be more benefit derived from hot fomentation than from 
e of medicines internally. </seg>

REPOBT OP THE VETERINARIAN. 

PARALYSIS OF THE HIND LIMBS OF HOGS. 

One of the diseases of the hog which has been quite an annoyance 
and caused heavy losses, usually manifests itself in mature animals, but 
very often in small pigs, by paralysis of the hind limbs. The animal at 
first shows a weakness by walking on its toes, some days previous to 
the final collapse. It also shows symptoms of pain and restlessness, by 
lying down, getting up again, moving around, and symptoms of colic. 
In some, symptoms of rheumatic pains are noticed. In the latter 
stages of the disease the hind limbs become weak. The animal knuckles 
in the ankles and finally drags its hind parts. The limbs are cold to 
the touch and the animal has no fever. Appetite is usually good. As 
the disease progresses the animal becomes weaker and the constant 
dragging of the lumbar region (hind parts) causes abrasions, as the 
animal will try in the early stages of the disease to move along with 
the other animals if possible. As stated above, the appetite does not 
seem to be impaired. The animals, however, do not as a rule make any 
rapid recovery. Very often when tonics are administered they finally 
get up on their feet again; but as a rule the animals seem to be weak 
and do not thrive well, and a recurrence of the disease may appear 
at any time. The disease usually appears in well fed hogs. I have 
noticed that this disease attacks some of the best and fattest animals 
tthe herd, either old animals or young shoats. I have found it 
asionally in sows that had just farrowed and that were not in the 
y best of flesh. 

The cause of this disease has been largely attributed to the kidney 
worm. Whether it is due to this parasite or not I shall not 
definitely state, but the observations made by the department certainly 
contradict that theory, for we have held hundreds of post 
mortems in the last six years on subjects affected with this disease 
and yet we have failed to find in a single instance a kidney 
worm in animals so affected. On the contrary, I have known of instances 
in which animals manifesting no symptoms of disease whatever 
and apparently sound in their feet have been shipped to the packing 
houses and the kidneys found to be very much diseased (degenerate 
— containing large cysts); and therefore I believe that it cannot 
be the kidney worm that causes this trouble, for if it were the kidney 
or the kidney worm we would certainly expect to see one or more 
kidneys partly destroyed in advanced stages of the disease; and yet 
these animals during life showed no trouble of this kind. This has 
often been demonstrated by post mortems on animals for other diseases, 
such as hog cholera, which revealed diseased kidneys, the owner 
having never noticed symptoms of this peculiar lameness. I think 
that the seat of the trouble is in the nerves of the spinal column, and 
we have therefore inaugurated the following treatment with very good 
success, judging from the reports received. 

The oDeration we recommended is to produce active inflammation by </seg>

using- the actual cautery. To produce this cauterization, take some 
strong wire, about eight inches long, and taper this at one end. Cut 
about eight wires of this length; secure your animal away from the 
buildings and build a small fire; place the wires therein, and when they 
are at a white heat secure them with pincers and insert them through 
the fat, down to the lumbar muscle, making eight punctures on each 
¦ide of the spinal column. Be sure to penetrate the fat so as to reach 
the muscular tissue. With this treatment we have been very successful. 
The reports of some two hundred cases have been favorable, and w« 
therefore venture to give our experience with this trouble and advise 
anyone who has cases of this kind to try this simple operation. 

I wish to say that while it may seem barbarous to use the heated 
wire yet it is not painful to the animals, as they do not seem to feel 
the white heated wire inserted in the fat, and it is not nearly as painful 
as some of the treatments I have seen where a large incision is 
made in the back and turpentine or Spanish fly applied, causing a very 
severe blister and intense pain. The wounds caused by the remedy I 
recommend in this article heal readily and in most cases leave no scars 
whatever. The animal should be kept on light food in a cool, shady 
place in the summer. It should be borne in mind that animals in this 

condition must not be subjected to a great deal of disturbance, which. 


causing excitement, is not beneficial to their recovery. Rest with 
proper diet is one of the essential features for this disease.

HISTORY. 

There have been numerous reports of a skin disease among cattle 
and horses from various parts of the state of Nebraska. The first 
reports received by the department were in 1896. Since then the inquiries 
have become far more numerous and upon investigation we find 
that this disease has been prevalent on the ranges of Colorado, Wyoming, 
Montana, and Kansas for a great many years. Dr. M. £. 
Knowles, in a paper read before the American Veterinary Medical 
Association in 1900, stated that cattle men had reported this disease as 
,ng to some extent for the last twenty years. It was generally 
regarded by experienced cattle men to be of little or no consequence, 
but they admitted that it had increased in the last two or three years. 
I have found the same conditions existing in our own state. "A number 
of reputable cattle men who have been in the range cattle business 
for thirty years or more believe that the infection came from the buffalo, 
and describe the disease as having affected the buffalo in the same </seg>

manner. Old buffalo hunters still residing in Montana have described 
to me such a skin affection, claiming to have killed buffalo where the 
hide was worthless from a complete absence of hafr. and covered with 
ulcers. They also relate that the disease appeared to be worse on the 
neck, withers and the base of the tail."* This disease is also described 
by Dr. N. S. Mayo in his Bulletin No. 69, Kansas Agricultural Experiment 
Station, as early as 1897. He suspects that it was introduce*} by 
Texas cattle. I am also informed by cattle men th.it this ibeaaa exists 
in certain parts of Canada. In our own state the disease is confined 
largely to the range districts. It has spread with remarkable rai 
within the last three years. This disease has been described by 
European authors as early as 1813.

SYMPTOMS. 

Cattle mange seems to be more troublesome during the late fall and 
winter than at any other time of the year. It usually disappears in 
the springtime when the cattle are turned on the pasture. Cattle of 
all ages may become affected but the disease MM to be more pronounced 
in yearlings and especially in bulls, because the bulls come in 
irt with most animals on the range, thus being more liable to 
infection. It has been stated by ranchmen that it is not so prevalent 
after a mild winter, but our experience does not verify that statement. 
It ia certainly not due to lack of food or to severe climatic conditions. 
but the true cause is the cattle mite. 

The first symptoms noticed are intense itching of the skin, usually 
in the region of the neck and shoulders, and shedding of the hair 
&lt;m the neck and withers. The irritation may extend to the shonl 
the sides of the chest, and in very aggravated cases over the entire 
body. However, the most prominent points where the disease first 
appears are, the base of the tail, the neck, withers, and shoul 
The skin becomes thickemd and very dry in places. It is not uncommon 
to find the skin becoming wrinkled, and the hair dropping off, 
leaving large bald patches of thickened and callous skin. As tin 
ease progresses Ihere is an intense itching and the animal will be seen 
rubbing itself against another or on wire fences or posts, sometimes 
ng large, bleeding scratches and sores. In the advanced stage 
the animals may be entirely void of hair. This produces anemia and 
if the animals are allowed to remain on the range without shelter 
losses are sure to occur. 

Brding to Dr. Mayo, if the hair comes off, the parasites leave 
art. the bald area gets well and the hair starts to grow again. 
Is in the advanced stages of the disease eat »ery little. They 
most of the time rubbing themselves on posts or licking each 

This disease spreads very rapidly throughout a herd. Our observation 
has been that, if animals have been exposed, it takes from four 
\ weeks before the disease makes its appearance in the herd. It 
is natural that thrifty animals should resist this disease much longer 
than cattle in a poor, debilitated condition. There is no doubt that 
this disease spreads by direct contact of infected with healthy animals. 
It is also true that railroad cars, stock yards, mangers, sheds, posts, 
chutes, and fences may be sources of infection. 

Eh and Mueller have remarked* on the modifications occurring in 
m of scabies by change of season, reciting an instance where 
:ase prevailed among cattle every year, commencing towards

the end of autumn, when the animals began to be housed, reaching 
its maximum in February, and diminishing 1 in the spring, when the 
• &gt;xen were employed at labor. The crusts then became detached, the 
hair grew, and there remained only a few patches at the root of the 
tail and on the neck. The train of symptoms reappeared each autumn. 
Neumann observed that these parasites (pxoroptrs) persist during the 
siimincr. although the eattle appeared to be cured, (ierlach and Mueller 
found the parasites in great numbers on the neck and around the 
horns. The writer has also found a great number of these pan 
during the summer months at the base of the horns and on the neck, 
the animals showing no symptoms whatever of inconvenience froih 

Dr. ¦"¦imk i in the I'nx-eedings of the American Veterinary Medical 
Association of 190(1 states that he found the parasite in great numbers 
during the summer months and was surprised at the slight amount of 
skin irritation during that iime. ]t must lx&gt; borne in mind that 
observe very closely to discover the parasites. In three herds 
in which the disease had existed during the winter and nothing had 
done in the line of treatment, the writer found during the month 
of June in every instance the parasites on the places named. It may 
be that these mites seem to disap|K&gt;ar during the summer months, as 
•anchmen have discovered, but from our observations they 
t the animal, but cause no noticeable inconvenience during this 
time: hence, it must be that they feed on the surface and hair of the 
animal: whereas, during the fall of the year these mites begin to burrow 
into the skin and produce this intense itching (jWWttM). 

TREATMENT. 

The problem of successfully stamping out this disease on our r 
is a very serious one. When only a small number of animals are to b« 
•¦d. any efficient liquid remedy can be successfully applied by 
means of a swab, brush, or spray pump. This method has been employed 
in controlling this disease on the average ranch for a number 
of years. It has been found to be both expensive and impracticable. 
When it becomes necessary to go over a large herd of cattle afT 
with mange, then the above method will be found wholly inaden 
Therefore I believe there is but one solution of this problem, one practical 
and certain way to wipe out this trouble on our ranges, and that 
is to erect dipping \ats aa that cattle can be thoroughly immersed in 
a solution that will kill these mites and yet be harmless to the animal. 
Hipping is becoming very popular, wholly on account of its pra 
bilitv. Dipping tanks are now a common sight on our ranges in the 
&gt;rn part of the state. Cattle men are beginning to dip, at regular 
periods, eattle affected with mange, the same as sheep affected with 
¦cab are dipped. 

There are a number of co-operative dipping tanks in operation in </seg>

            <seg id="p071">

different parts of the grazing country in our state and they have 
prown to be a great benefit to the stock growers wherever they have 
operated. The operation for dipping cattle is not a difficult one 
but is precisely like that of dipping sheep. All that is necessary is a 
cling pen and a corral with a chute leading to the tank. At the 
¦ ¦lid of the chute is a sloping surface on which the animal slides into 
the t;ink, swimming through the preparation. See that the head aa 
well as the body is thoroughly immersed. A simple plunge in and out 

of the buth is .sufficient for lice or ticks, but immersion of from one to 
three minutes should l&gt;e given for mange. The process of simply dipping 
in vats, without the previous breaking down of the scales with 
brush or broom, will not allow the liquid to reach and destroy the ore 
and young nctiri, and their continued presence must inevitably cause 
the itch to reappear after a short time. For this reason it is well to

experiments and we recommend that these coal tar preparations be 
used at that strength. I have known instances where a much stronger 
solution of these coal tar preparations was used by mistake without 
any injurious effects on the animal. There is no danger at all connected 
with the operation of dipping. However, it is not advisable to 
dip animals that are in the advanced stages of pregnancy. 

After cattle have been dipped they should nut be allowed to lie i 
in the old infected corral, nor to mingle with diseased cattle. It is 
better to wait for some time before taking them back to the oltl range

In conclusion I wish to mention a few conditions resulting from 
mange. The writer has seen numerous herds that were report) 
!&gt;»• dying with some mysterious disease. These animals were a pitiful 
sight to behold. They were thin, emaciated, very much debilitated, 
and hardly able to exist under range conditions of the most favorable 

imply because they were one mass of running sores and scabs. 
ere too poor to go over a large territory each day to pick up 

food, and soon would die. They were also bearers of infection 

to The remainder of the herd and especially to the young stock. Animals 
that have been affected with mange need more and better food 
to carry them through the winter niKiiths. 

Climatic conditions are of great imi&gt;ortance. Animals affected with 
a wry bail case of mange very often die in severe storms, because 
they have lost the natural protection, the hair. 

The young calf crop is also an important consideration in mangy 
herds. It stands to reason that cows affected with mange and having 
to endure some of the above-named condition.-- are very apt to abort. 
The writer has seen a number of herds on the range in which abortion 
occurred on account- of lack of vitality to tarry the young the full 
time. The writer has also observed that when mange existed in herds 
it was not uncommon to find that the young calves were born weak 
and with less vitality. For this reason a large number of them would 
die three or four days after birth with what is commonly known as 
W cholera or white scours. It is also a fact that in herds where mange 
s the first animal to lienime infected is the bull. If nothing' is 
to relieve the bull of this parasite, he will soon run down in flesh 
and, if allowed to remain in the herd, not only will he infect the whole 
herd but his get will be of inferior quality. 

Taking economy into consideration, we find it costs eoasldei 
¦ per head to winter animals affected with this disease. The facts 
are in favor of dipping cattle f&lt;&gt;r mange are overwhelming. </seg>

the animal walks in on the level from the chute and crowding pens, 
until he touches the iron and slides easily into the tank. The draining

there will be no place for the liquid to leak out. Around the eili.' 
this floor should be nailed a strip of 2-inch stuff to prevent the liquid 
from running off the floor. Huild a good high fence around this floor. 

"The chute leading to the vat should be not less than .S2 feet long 
besides wings or crowding pen at the outer end. The last 16 feet of 
he chute, which contains the slide, should be tight and smooth, so 
hat after the animal begins to slide nothing in the construction will 
give him a chance to catch anywhere and hang with his weight down in

of insects on the hog is a very serious matter. It is a fact that very

short time a very weak, debilitated condition of the animnl. making him 
far more susceptible to other diseases that the animal is heir to. 
louse has not been credited with occasioning serious loss, but of late 
I more attention has Ix-en given to this little insect by the 
part incut of Animal Pathology. We have found that the hog loose

the inhalation of an excessive amount of dust there should be a slight 
pneumonia of the lungs, the animals badly affected with lice will be 
all the more apt to die. 

We have also found that where animals affected with cholera were 
free from lice there was a much smaller percentage of loss sust. 
than where the herds were largely affected with lice. This has been 
brought to our attention after examining numerous herds in various 
parts of the state during the last five years. The first rule that we 
now insist upon when we visit an outbreak of cholera is to exu&lt;

hog- houses is as follows: For the stables we prefer to use hot water 
and him of the &lt;-oiil tar preparations, such as zenoleum. chloronaptholeimi.

After the stables and pens are thoroughly disinfected the animals 
should be disinfected also. This can be done by dipping them, which

tank. These dipping tanks can be bought on the market very 
reasonably. If one is not in favor of using the (lipping tank, or does

Id have them on a wooden floor and must have quite a large and 
forcible pump, so that they can be thoroughly saturated with the 
liquid. If sprayed, they should also be rubbed with a broom immediately 
so that the fluid will soak well into the skin. The solution that 
we recommend is from :; to 4 per cent, for grown hogs and abi 
per cent, for small pig's. In our experience we have not found any

It aids tlif very best balanced ration that ran be given to a hog, by

who have begun to dip their hogs find it very economical and a 
very efficient method of ridding the animals of these insects. The coal

zenoleum, Lincoln dip. and Lee's carbolic dip — leave the skin in a very 
soft, pliable condition, and I believe that it is a very economical and

in this article that it is absolutely necessary to procure a dipping tank. 

I havr known instances where our American farmer, with his l- 

for making the most of his surroundings, has soori~improvised a prnjH-r 

dipping tank with a very little cost. It is the purpose of the writer to 

urge every gTower of swine to dip his hogs at least every three tm 

four weeks to have the very l&gt;est success, and also to use liberally any 

of these dips in hog pens; and he will attain the very best results nd 

in a great measure prevent infectious diseases from gaining any foot- 

hold on his premises. 

We herewith mention some of the well-known sheep dips that li:or 

tried by the government and found very effectual in the eradia- 

tion of scab among sheep. However, I wish to state that the liiuc-and- 

sulphur dips are somewhat dangerous. They must be prepared exactly 

rdlng to the formula given, for, if not, they are liable to produce 

bad results. It is not uncommon to find cattle with eves swollen shut 

after being dipped in too strong a solution of lime and sulphur.

unusually severe oases, an ooze with more lime in proportion to the 

amount of sulphur, such as the Victorian (No. 1), the Nevada (J|&lt; 

or the South African (No. 3) dip might be used. 

"Many other formula; might be cited, but these are enough to show 

i lit- preat variations in the dips which have been used; and to prove 

that when a party simply states that 'lime and sulphur' is an excellent 

¦lip. or that it is a dangerous dip, or that he has succeeded or failed 

with it, or that the lime-and-sulphur dip is injurious to the wool, his 

¦units cannot be taken as definite, unless he also states which

If a lime-and-sulphur dip is chosen, it is better for ordinary cases 

to use the solutions containing a small amount of lime and three times 

uch sulphur as lime, as the Fort Collins formula (33 pounds of

PREPARATION OF THE MIXTURE. 

"Almost as many different methods of preparing the liquid exists 
are different^ formulie. some of the methods laying great 
¦ updn sifting both the lime and sulphur, others laying great 
stress upon allowing the liquid to settle, others leaving out of conation 
both of these points. The method which has been found in 
the liureau to be the easiest and most satisfaetorv is as follows: 

¦Take 8 to 11 pounds of unslaked lime, place it in a mortar box 
tettle or pail of some kind, and add enough water to slake the 
nd form a iime paste' or 'lime putty.'* 

¦Sift into this lime paste fhree times as many pounds of flowers 
phur as used of lime, a.id stir ttfe mixture well. 

"P.e sure to weigh both the lime and the sulphur. Do not trunu-tng 
them in ¦ bucket or to guessing at the weight. 

I'lace the sulphur-lime paste in a kettle or boiler with about 25 
gallons of boiling water, and boil the mixture for two hours at 
. stirring the liquid and sediment. The boiling should be continued 
until the sulphur disappears, or almost disappears, from the 
ire: the solution is then of a chocolate or liver color. The longer 
ilution boils the more the sulphur is dissolved, and the less M 
th&gt;' mi/I' becomes. Most writers advise boiling from thirty to forty 
minutes, but we obtain a much better ooze by boiling from two to 
three hours, adding water when necessary. 

Bl'our the mixture and sediment into a tub or barrel placed near 
pping vat and provided with a bunghole about four inches from 
ittoni. and allow ample time (two to three hours, or more if 
ary) to settle. 

In- use of some sort of settling tank provided with a bunghole

will answer very well as a small settling tank. To insert a spigot 
about three to four inches from the bottom is an easy matter. Draining 
off the liquid through a spigot has the great advantage over dip- 

Kiny persons prefer to sl»ke the lime to a powder, which is to be sifted and 
with sifted sulphur. One pint of water will slake three pounds of lime it the

The term "tuberculosis" we ma\ nonymous with consumption, 
and statistics show that one-tenth of all the deaths in mankind is produced 
by this disease. It is a great plague and consequently should 
receive a most careful investigation and general study. The word 
tuberculosis has become a household term. It is to be found • 
where in modern medical literature, and there is good reason for it. 
troys man and his animals. 

The cattle raisers of this country have discovered that tuberci 
is a serious menace to their industry. It has caused very great financial 
loss, and to the breeders of cattle and the medical men who treat 
cattle in some sections of the United States, it has become an •• 
day problem. The disease spreads among all wild animals which are 
kept in confinement in the menageries of this country, and it is with 
very great difficulty that such menageries are maintained. MonJ 
lions, elephants: yes. all kinds of animals die with tuberculin 
sionally we observe that the fowl raiser must contend with it. It 
destroys the chicken and turkey. 

B swine raiser must look closely into the subject, that he may 
his business. In talking with raisers of swine and with handlers 
le. I am impressed with the thought that somehow they have 
rued that tuberculosis is any particular menace to the

Neb.. January 23, 1903. </seg>

industry, and that there is likely to be any great loss from it. Somethe 
opinion seems to prevail that the hog does not get this malthat 
he is not subject to it. I am sure that close observation on 
the part of swine raisers will show that this is not true; that by a 
little investigation they will find that all of the swine which die on 
the farm have not died of hog cholera; that oftentimes the malady is 
what is known as the great white plague, tuberculosis. 

The cause and nature of tuberculosis is now fairly well understood 
by IhoM who are studying it; and can be easily comprehended by anyw 
ho will give it a little attention. The animal body is made up 
Us or unit elements arranged into groups and tissues, and these 
arger masses or organs. The individual cells vary greatly in shape, 
and are microscopic in size. The flesh and bone is made up of fixed 
that is. cells which are as it were cemented together into tissues 
ami organs. The fluids which run throughout the body carry large 
numbers of loose cells, and these loose cells can. under certain influnredge 
their way between the fixed cells. 

Tuberculosis is caused by a cell or germ called the tubercle bacillus, 
which is verv much smaller than the cells of the animal tissue, and 
when once lodged in it. can penetrate between the tissue cells. If you 
Id place a piece of lead pencil an inch long beside an average apple, 
¦ ¦ild give you a working idea of the relative shape and size of the 
bacillus of tuberculosis and a blood cell, but you must bear in minil 
that these objects are 10,000 times the size of the disease germ and 
I cell. This little organism, the bacillus tuberculosis, finds ene 
into the body through many channels, and when it liecomes 
il in a tissue suitable for its growth it will multiply. Ait&lt; 
not long, this germ has become many germs; and in the growth 
of these germs there is developed a poisonous substance which irrithe 
nerves in this tissue, anil that brings about an increased 
v of blood to the tissue, and causes the flow to it of certain cells 
which arc supposed to have the power of combat. These cells will 
initiate in all the tissue around the little colony of germs, ami 
with their accumulation the tissue heaps up into a little hillock, just 
a little, small elevation, and this elevation is called a tubercle. As this 
Ne develops, these little hillocks, or elevations, or tubercles, appear 
over the body, and the name given to the disease is tuberculosis. These 
little bacilli or germs secrete or make the poisonous substance in their 
&gt;th. and make it in sufficient quantity to destroy the tissues about 
h they are. and while the tubercle keeps growing on the edges 
i-ntral portion of the tubercle is a mass of dead tissue. This mass 
sometimes is liquid, but in most cases and in most animals it is dry.

¦the outside of the tubercle there is a coloring matter, enough 
y to make it pink in color, but when cut through there is found

particles in the cheesy mass, so when the knife euts through the 
tubercle it feels gritty: or when the surface is cut across with a k 
:m&lt;l the finger passed over it. it feels rough. This general outline of 
a single tubercle is multiplied by other tubercles developing round or 
upon it. until they pile up into a tubercular mass, sometimes lik 
unto ¦ bunch of grapes, or they may lie separated and appear as 
pearly, yellow or pink elevations. If you are examining' the carcass 
of a hog and find such growths and by cutting them open you find the 
is are cheesy masses, you will know they are the lesions of tuber- 
I lie parts of the body in which those lesions are found are 
rarely the seats of any other disease producing like lesions, henc 
chances of being mistaken ore not many. 

Krimi the various sources of information upon which I have been 
nble to draw, tuberculosis is found in swine in all parts of the I 
States, but perhaps more abundantly in the central west, in Nebraska 
and Kansas, Iowa, and parts of Missouri. The disease seems to become 
more prevalent as time goes on. Either the men whose business 
it is to observe diseases in animals that are slaughtered for food, are 
searching more carefully, or else there is a very great increase in the 
number of animals having the diseases. I recall inspecting animals that 
were slaughtered for food, some six years ago, devoting several months 
to the exclusive work of making post-mortem examinations of swine, 
and during the several months I probably examined 200,000. While I 
could not give as close attention to it as is being done now, with more 
inspectors to do the work, I believe that I did not find more than a 
half dozen well-marked cases. Ihiring the last three months, an inspector 
at a slaughter house where about 3,000 swine were slaughtered 
daily, found several hundred cases, it being not a rare thing to find 
thirty or forty during one day's slaughter. 

A little observation as to the ages and kinds of swine in whieli 
disease is found most frequently, shows the greatest number in sows 
which have farrowed one or more litters of pigs. It seems that when 
young pigs are infected, the disease runs a rather rapid course, more 
so than in the aged animals, and when so infected they do not grow 
as do the uninfected swine and they do not put on fat; they are thin 
and lanky. The owner discovering that they are not thriving as they 
should, concludes that it does not pay to continue feeding them; markets 
them at once and they are to be found in slaughter houses, sometimes 
thirty, forty or more in one bunch or lot. 

In the animal which is infected after reaching maturity the disease 
runs a rather slow course and, as is stated before, is usually found in 
\hieh have farrowed two or three litters. 

¦c|uestion as to how they get it is a practical one and is one which 
&gt;ar the closest scrutiny, and one which will cause the owners

believed that they pet it in their food supply. As stated in the l&gt;eginninp. 
tnlxTiulosis prevails amonp cattle, and, as you msiy know, it 
is Ike custom of the fanner in this section of the country — Nebraska, 
Kansiis. Iowa when he loses a cow. a steer, which has gradually become 
less thrifty anil finally dies, or he sees it would die and destroys 
it. to remove it to the swine lot and let the swine eat it. There is a 
common understanding that the flesh of cattle is excellent food for 
bog! and drives them special thriftiness. hence the practice just mentioned. 
And it is probable that this is one of the main sources of 
I'ont.'imination. 

Tin' small slauuhterinp houses throughout the country are a source 
of infection. Farmers who have a cow or steer which does not thrive 
well, and which they cannot sell to advantage with others they are 
rig or are ready to ship to market, find in the local butcher oftenlimcs 
¦ customer. He mini 1 1 the animal to his slaughtering M 
lishment. and not having the same facilities for the disposition of the 
lines ami other organs, as in the larpe abattoirs, where all liniiscable 
parts arc rendered into fertilizers, he keeps a bunch of hops to 
he blood, intestines, lunps and unsalable parts of the carcass. Th" 
unthrifty cow or steer may !&gt;e afflicted with t uberculosis. as is often the 
rase, and becomes th€ source of swine infection. 

1 recall a statement made by an inspector at one of the Missouri 
points, whose assistant found US hops having tuberculosis at 
time of slaughter, and each of these hops had a distinctive mark 
in one car. The mark enabled the inspector to trace them to the commission 
house and from the commission house to the shipper in a town 
in Xehra.-ka. The shipper was certain that he bought these hogs from 
a nun who was feeding at a slaughter house. The whole bunch was 
I directly, as clearly as you can trace any such thinp. back to 
litering establishment where they were fed, and I think that 
can be imi reason to doubt that these hops were infected by 
a the entrails of cattle which had t ul&gt;erculosis. 

I believe there is still another source of infection, and that is in 
tul'erculi.us people. The habits of tulH'rculous people are peculiar and 
unless you have associated with them you do not quite appreciate it. 
A man who is sufferinp from tuberculosis of the limps is unable to 
work. He is on the farm. He must do something. He must go here

lis 1mm i 11 one or more of the teats, usually one, soni' 
id in no other part of the body, showing that the infection was 
irus getting into that particular part. 

There are other sources and ways of infection, but those given are 
the most common. When onre the disease is introduced into the herd, 
then it is readily propagated from the diseased to the healthy, and thus 
the infected animal becomes a source of further distribution of the 

There is much interest to be taken in the channels of the body 
through which these germs may find entrance and the tissue in which 
they may propagate. Close observation shows that most cases are infected 
through the structures of the throat. You recall what the t 
is in your own throat. Swine have a similar structure in their throat, 
and just beyond these tonsils or in relation to them are structures 
known as lymph ganglia, or glands, or kernels. These lymph ganglia 
are simply centers along the course of little vessels which lead from 
the tissues in all parts of the body to the central blood stream, and 
next to tonsilar disturbances, the disease is found in these glands, at 
the angle of the jaw. just inside. In the government inspection these 
(rliinds are carefully examined and it is surprising to note the large 
numl&gt;er that are found to be diseased. Finding it there, calls for inition 
all over the body. 

\t in frequency to this infection of the glands of the neck is the 
glands of the liver. The liver receives blood direct from the I 
tines. A germ such as we have described, is small enough to pals 
through the blood stream from the intestines to the liver, and from 
the lymph channels of that organ gets into the glands adjacent to the 
liver, which seems to explain the second most frequent location. Then 
conies the distribution to the lung structure, to the walls of the abdomen, 
and to the walls of the chest; the germs building up little hillocks 
all over the surface, studding it, as we say, with tubercles. The disease 
is said to be generalized when it is found in several organs or spread 
all over the body. Often in recent infection it is confined to a few 
places, or glands, but where the case has been infected -long enough, 
the disease is disseminated over the body. Surprising as it may seem, 
this little organism will grow in all parts of the animal body. We 
find it in the bones, tendons, muscles, joints, and in every place, setting 
up the characteristic lesions which I have tried to picture to you. 

Een the disease is in the throat and the glands swell (these lymph 
lia that I have been speaking of) they will grow from small 
s the size of my finger tips, to the size of a walnut or larger, 
narrows the opening into the throat, makes it difficult for the hog

little difficulty in swallowing, perhaps a little extra fullness in the neck, 
iding upon the breed and unthriftiness. Where the animal is 
growing rapidly and has not been infected too early, the hog may reach 
maturity and get very fat before the disease will interfere «'ifh_ 
the vital powers and the nnimal's health and condition be affected. 

Tuberculosis sometimes develops in the bowel and adjacent gla 
-. -rioiis-ly disturbs the function of that organ, causing a period of 
ilrviHNs or constipation, then n ]&gt;eriod of diarrhea, alternating, and the 
animal goes along in this way, gradually getting thinner, until it either 
destroyed. 

i are interested in the duration of the disease. In man. you know, 
it may run three or four years; in oattlr, usually not so long, fn swine 
the natural life of the nuimal is shorter, and I believe the disease runs 
a much more rapid course. If a sow which is infected brings forth a 
litter of pigs, and they become infected from the sow, the disease will 
not permit the pigs to live more than four, five, or at the outside, six 
months. They die thin, spindling affairs. Men have observed that their 
lied, but they did not know why — never dreamed that the trouble 
was tuberculosis, and I suspect that had all the breeders in Nebraska 
careful investigation and reported all the cases of this kind to 
central agency, the number would be greater than .we even sur- 

The loss to the man who is rearing them is a seriouVone, and particularly 
so if the disease begins in pure bred stock. If a breeder has 
ted out fifteen, twenty or thirty young brood sows and breeds 
jhem. anil discovers at about the time that the little ones should be 
nad that the sows are very unthrifty and cough some, have diarrhea, 
and the little pigs are not well, because of tuberculosis, it becomes 
a very serious matter to him. The farmers are injured in another way. 
The great number of swine which are being condemned by the federal 
meat inspectors at the large markets makes the packer protect himself 
by paying a little less for what he buys. He must do that; he does do it. 
My observation is that when hog cholera was very prevalent in the 
markets, that the packer always bought expecting to lose a certain 
number, and he bought accordingly, and so it is with tuberculosis; and 
the packer feels just as interested as the breeder and the raiser that a 
r knowledge of this disease may cause measures to be taken to 
prevent its spread, to stop its ravages. 

Four or five years ago, when I heard an inspector state: "Well. I 
found fifty cases of hog cholera today. It's pretty tough on that 
packer. They were diseased and I had to take them," and I went with 
him and looked them over. I found perhaps one or two additional 
cues of tuberculosis in the condemned bunch. When I go into the 
same place now and the inspector says, "Well, I found twenty-five cases 
today," and I auk. "What did you find the disease to be?" his answer 
is, "Oh. tuberouloato." I then look them over with him and find perhaps </seg>

us which interest you most. 

If :i man discovers his herd is infected. I would advise slanghtt 
• k animals, and if it be not a pure bred herd, the slaught' 
all the herd, the disinfection of the premises, and then care in 
tion of a new stock. Pure bred animals which have been exposed 
to infection should Ik- isolated and watched for several months (s 
eight) which will give time for the development of the disease if infection 
has taken place. Tf a man's herd is not already infected, then 
he should l&gt;e alert, whenever he bought others to add to it, and be 
that the herd from which he was buying is not infected, and by wo 
doing, keep his herd free from tuberculosis. If he has an animal on 
the farm that dwindles away, gets poor and dies, he should not f i • 
to the hogs until sure it is free from tuberculosis. If there be a tuberculous 
person in the household, he should see to it that their expect i 
their spittle, does not reach the provender supply, the slop pail, or 
other means by which the swine may get hold of it. With this 
of precaution, certain it is that the disease will not spread fur 
and it should be eliminated from the herds of Nebraska. 

One word as to the disposition of these tuberculous animals. I 
is the loeal butcher, and you can say to him: This herd has something 
wrong with it. 1 l&gt;elieve it is tuberculosis. Will you buy my herd and

consumption: if two or three glands are discovered to lw diae 
the flesh can he safely rendered into lard. l!ut where the tubercles are 
distributed over various parts of the body, the carcass should l&gt;e r

Dr. Stewardt: The probabilities are that the calf would be infected. 

Question: How soon would the calf show it? 

Dr. Stewart: It may show very early in life of the calf: perhaps ma 
early as three or four months; cases lire reported where it has shown 
earlier, others where it was not seen until one and even two years old. 

Question: Hut if the calf should not show it until say a year old,

Question: Is there any danger in the use of tuberculous meat from 
infected animals?

flesh of tuberculous animals or drink the milk from the tuber&gt; 
cow. 

K Jacob Wolf: 1 would like to ask the gentleman if when these 
i are inhaled by a perfectly sound hog or by a man or any kind 
ist, if he thinks is is necessary — almost necessary — that they should 
this disease, or in other words, that these germs would make 
rss; or does he think that the majority of healthy people or 
i.v animals are immune to those germs? 

Dr. Stewart: In answer to the question I would say that if every 
animal and every person which inhaled a tuberculous germ became 
infected we would soon have no animals nor people on the face of the 
. and it is only occasionally that a case of inhalation infection 
occurs. No, I would not say immune, but I would say that unless there 
was a wound on the surface on which the germ found lodgment, there 
great probability that the surface would protect itself from 
invasion. 

Question: I would like to ask what are the first outward appear 
ances? 

Dr. Stewart: When the development is in the throat it is coughing, 
difficulty of swallowing, and gradual decline in physical condition; when 
the imM is in the Im&gt;wH it is diarrhea, alternating with constipation, 
and physical decline.

Dr. Peters: The question that has been just raised is one thnhare 
to meet in our state probably every week. I was very hapi 
learn tliiit I&gt;r. Stewart had consented to come here and pre 
paper. Now. we lose many thousands of dollars' worth of hogs in 
this state from tuberculosis. At the present time we have in our 
charge a valuable herd that I have just advised to l&gt;e sold on account 
of tuberculosis originating in this herd from the owner 
having a cow that had wasted away and he thought was }&gt;i 
yooil to skin and throw it to the hops because it was good "ph 
for them! A little while after this his sows began to die, and he 
made some examinations. He said: "This is the only thing I hare 
e\er seen in hogs that I do not know anything about." and he knows 
&lt;|iiite a good deal about hogology. He sent me a specimen and I told 
him that 1 suspected tuberculosis. I made a visit to the herd, and sure 
enough some of his thoroughbreds were badly infected. Now. he has an 
infected herd and his little, small pigs, three months old, are wasting 
away and dying with this destroyer of his entire herd. So the only 
thing to do is to sell the entire outfit, and thoroughly disinfect, and 
a new herd. I know a number of herds that are reported to be 
living of cholera that have tul&gt;erculosis. and the disease is increasing. 
It has ma le a rapid increase in our state since I have been connected 
with the station, and for that reason we wish to inaugurate a campaign 
of education among the breeders, to eradicate the disease. I consider 
that this disease is as bad if not worse than hog cholera, for this 
reason: if you have hog cholera you are going to get through with it 
in a short time, and then you will have a new start; but when you have 
this disease in your herd, you will never get through with it. If you keep 
on bringing in fresh stock, thoroughbred stock, the infection extends 
to them, and that is why it is more dangerous than the hog cholera.

HUDAPE8T. 

There is scarcely a book on feeding or dietics in which one cannot 
find advice or opinions with regard to the very best way of watering 
:il», but almost without exception these arc l&gt;ased solely on theo;isideratious 
or hypotheses, and, in the absence, for the most 
part, of any e\|MTimental basis, have no value beyond that which atniorc

tiering is the best. And this applies with special force to the 
as to whether animals should be watered before, during or 
after meals. It is, therefore, not surprising that different authors 
ise quite contradictory views, for all of which it is claimed that 
have tin- support of "experience." The following extracts, taken 
the literature to which I have access, will place that beyond any

is diminished is a question that has not wired, at leaitnent. 
All that can he said on the point is that in such fit 
stances ¦ good many oat grains appear to lie passed in an undigested 
conilition. Theoretically, it would certainly appear to be the l&gt;est plan 
always to allow a horse water before he has his corn, perha| &gt;- 
has been gfveu a little hay, and also some time after he has finishi 
corn ration. Watering- before feeding is indicated when the horse has 
Ix-cn at hard work, with consequent abundant loss of water and a m 
what thick condition of the saliva and gastric juice. Howevi 
is that horsi s arc seldom very thirsty before foo&lt;l, and drink 
less then than afterward: indeed, they then frequently prefer too 
water. A point that deserves to be specially insisted upon is tli 
the case of all Indigestible food materials, and those that tend to e 
pas, rare in watering is strictly necessary, drains possessing an envelope 
are socially apt to swell up strongly in the stomach when a large 
quantity of water is taken immediately after a meal, and the t ; 
of the animal may easily 1m- induced in this way. In their ca 
fore, it must be laid down as a fundamental rule to water the animal 
some time before feeding and not allow drink again until two ! 
after the meal." 

wiiKN ami now oftkh. 

To the question. When and how often should animals be wat&lt; 
1'ott gives the following answer: 

•It is not possible to give a direct answer to this question. One may 
rre that when animals are left to themselves they often drink te« 
or twelve times daily, and even at night, certainly always in f 
quantities. Many e\]&gt;erieiiced agriculturists regard this as a very good 
plan and l&gt;etter than watering only two or three times daily, when too 
much liquid may easily be taken. The latter plan, however, is much 
more convenient and the former is often altogether impracticable, in 
which case the Wst plan is to allow the animals as much fresh water 
as they will drink when the meal is finished. It is also a common plan 
to give water before or during feeding time, but that method has I 
ing to recommend it. As already mentioned, there are special reasons 
why sheep ought to be allowed the opportunity to drink pure water 
before they are driven out." 

On the subject of gastric digestion Ellenberger expresses the follow 
tag vi. 

"It is permissible to give water after feeding with hay. but this is 
less advisable after a ration of oats, as thereby the oats may easily be 
washed out into the intestine. It is a good plan, however, to ¦ 
some water, because it prolongs the amylolytic period of gastric digestion. 
Horses are not inconvenienced by drinking, because it pron 
flows through the stomach. The case is different in the dog, in which 
gastric digestion is seriously impeded In drinking, owing to the 
retention of the water in the stomach."

C.I XKItU I tSTOM IX FRANCE. 

In France, according to Sanson. it is a very jfeneml custom to water 
animal* after every meal. and. in the case of those fed with hay and 
after the former and before the latter. This plan of watering is 
\~ permissible, provided care is taken that the animals do not 
drink too much at once. (selko and Kossutany in their work on 
"Dietetics" state the Veterinary Surgeon Marlot. by post-mortem examination 
of two horses, convinced himself that when water is gilva 
tats the greater part of the latter is washed out into the intesline, 
and from this observation the conclusion is drawn that in such 
circumstance s the oats are also imperfectly digested. It is also stated 
that Marlot repeatedly observed that when horses were watered immediately 
afler food the feees always contained undigested trrains of 
On the ground of this observation, (selko anil Kossutany think 
that animals ought always to be watered before food. but. since this 
plan is open to objection for other reasons, one may lav down the 
rml principle that it is best to water animals from half to one hour 
after food. 

Klic, in his observations, watered before meals, hut alloweil 
handful of hay before the water. On physiological (.'rounds 
thinks one should adhere strictly to this plan of watering: 

•ice severe exertion, in consequence of the great loss of v\ 
causes tin' saliva and gastric juices to take on a thicker character. 
- in such circumstances, if they are not tirst allowed water, will 
. food, or at least masticate it incompletely or with little appetite. 
ition is incompletely performed, and the masticated food arrives 
in an imperfect state of preparation in the stomach. The quantity of 
!&lt;¦ juice l&gt;eing thus insufficient the whole mass of albumen cannot 
inverted into the easily soluble peptone, nor will the conditions 
be improved when the horse is subsequently allowed to drink. On the 
contrary, the digestive process in the stomach will be still further disturbed, 
since the gastric juice present will be diluted to an abnormal 
1; and. besides, owinp to the small size of the stomach, as already 
mentioned, a considerable part of the contents will lie prematurely 
carried into the intestine. The defective secretion of saliva and gastric 
juice thus determines incomplete digestion of the food consumed, and 
may be reckoned among; the numerous causes of colic.

in many regiments, the evil may be only partially remedied, since that 
period at which digestion is completed varies from two to four hours, 
according to the nature of the food. When water is given before food 
the poverty of the blood and tissues in water disappears in a few minutes. 
Saliva and gastric juice can then be secreted in bundance while 
the animal is eating, become intimately mixed with the food during 
mastication and come into action in the stomach in an undiluted condi- 

So far as I can see from the literature that I have been able to 
consult, Gabriel and Weiske are the only authors who have sought to 
bring exact experiments to bear on the question "whether the ingeation 
of drinking water exerts any influence on the digestion of food or on 
the exchange of nitrogen in the body, according as it takes place ad 
libitum before or after meals." Their experiments were carried out 
on two sheep and the diet consisted of hay and oats. The experiments 
showed that the different methods of watering exerted no noteworthy 
influence on metabolism or on the digestion of the food, so that Gabriel 
and Weiske held that they are justified in maintaining that, at least 
under the conditions of their experiment, "as regards any effect on the 
digestion and assimilation of the food, it is a matter of indifference 
whether the animals are watered before or after meals, or are allowed 
to drink ad libitum at all times." 

VIEWS ABE COWTRAD1CTOBT. 

Esuch contradictory views it must be very difficult to satisfy 
elf as to what is the preferable method of watering, since theoy 
grounds may be brought forward to support each of the 
it plans. The question has most importance in the case of the 
horse, whose relatively small stomach can accommodate only a comparatively 
small quantity of food and water at the same time, and in 
which there is also the further anatomical peculiarity that the pylorus 
is never quite firmly closed. On a priori grounds, therefore, one might 
expect that in this animal the method of watering would have the 
greatest influence on the digestion of the food. The views of the authors 
cited relate mainly to the horse, and they all agree naturally only 
on the ground of ordinary observation and theoretical speculation) that 
the horse should not be given water immediately after oats, because 
thereby a large part of the oats is washed out of the stomach in an 
undigested condition and is therefore not so well assimilated. Now, so 
far as I am aware, there is not a single experimental fact to prove that 
oats are less perfectly absorbed when after a short sojourn in the 
stomach a considerable proportion is washed out undigested into the 
intestines, and that is the whole point in connection with the question 
of wate-jng after food, for in all circumstances a large part of the 
oats, within a short time ofter ingestion, is passed on in an undigested 
condition through the wide-open pylorus into the duodenum. There is 

13 </seg>

            <seg id="p102">

just as little experimental proof that a thick character of the saliva 
and gastric juice exerts any influence on the digestion and assimilation 
of the food, and it cannot be regarded as proved that more undigested 
grains of oats are passed with the feces when water is given after 
meal*, as the allegation is based only on appearances and not on the 
results of chemical analysis. 

In view of the great importance and theoretical interest of the 
question, it appeared to me to be desirable to ascertain by exact 
experiment whether the method of watering has any influence on the 
nutritive value of the food, that is to say, whether it is best to water 
horses before, during or after meals. I would have liked at the same 
time to ascertain the influence of watering on metabolism, but that 
was impossible owing to the unfavorable external circumstances at 
our institute. 

The experiments were carried out in four strong, healthy horses, 
a 214-year-old stallion and three geldings, two of which were 10 
years old, and the third 14 years old. Inasmuch as I have already 
published a detailed account of the experiment* in the Landwirthschaftliche 
Versuchsstationen, I will here refer only to the results. It 
should be mentioned that with the exception of one horse (No. 2) each 
animal was made the subject of several experiments. In some of the 
experiments the only food given was hay, and in others hay and corn. 
According to the plan of the experiment, water was given: (1) Immediately 
before food (the food was first placed before the animal after it 
has satisfied itself with water, the remainder of the latter being then removed) 
; (2) during the meal, between the hay and the corn, sometimes 
the hay and in others the corn being given first; (3) immediately after 
the meal, when the whole of the ration had been consumed. 

Eith a view to the determination of the amount of the food digested 
absorbed, the stall was, of course, so constructed as to permit of 
collection of the whole of feces and urine. The chemical analysis 
he food and feces and the preparation of the same previous to 
analysis was conducted with the greatest accuracy and each 
ysis was duplicated. 

AGREE IN ESSENTIAL POINTS. 

More weight attaches to the results of the experiments owing to the 
fact that in all essential points these were in agreement, and notably 
with regard to the main point, viz., the effect of the method of watering 
on the digestion of the food. In those experiments in which both hay 
and corn were given the different methods of watering showed either 
no difference in the digestion coefficients, or no greater differences than 
occurred with the same method of watering (partly owing to unavoidable 
experimental errors, and partly to variation in the activity of 
digestion or absorption), and this no matter whether the corn was 
given before or after the hay. Moreover, it is clear that the slight </seg>


            <seg id="p103">
195 

differences observed in the coefficients of digestion cannot be ascribed 
to the method of watering, since the differences in each method did 
not by any means lie all in the same direction. Sometimes the highest 
values were found when the water was given after food and in others 
when it was given before or during the meal, and this not only with 
different animals, but also with one and the same animal. 

KThe three series of experiments with diet composed exclusively of 
ly deserve special attention (two experiments with horse 3 and one 
with horse 4). Except in the case of experiment 1 with horse 3, the 
digestion coefficients show no greater differences than in the experiments 
with a mixed diet; it ought to be observed, however, that with 
horse 3, experiment 1, all the digestion coefficients, and in the other 
two experiments, the majority of these, were lower when the water was 
given before food than when it was given after. The hay was thus 
somewhat better digested and absorbed in the method of watering 
after food. The difference, however, was not important; the favorable 
influence of watering after food, if it is at all constant, is very slight, 
for otherwise it would always have been observable in those experiments 
in which both hay and corn were given. It is true that in some 
periods of the experiments (but only with horses 3 and 4) the digestion 
coefficients were to an unimportant extent higher when the water was 
given after food than when it was given before, but there were others 
in which the contrary was observed. Besides, the favorable influence 
of watering after food on the digestion of hay ought to have been more 
striking in those experiments in which the horses received relatively 
more hay along with the oats, as in experiment 1 with horse 3, and 
experiment 3 with horse 4, but such was not the case. 

In order that the observed results may be better apprehended, I have 
for each of the four horses calculated the mean value of the digestion 
coefficients for each period with the same method of watering, for these 
then relate to a larger number of days, and thus furnish a more reliable 
measure of the digestion with each method of watering. These 
mean values are shown in the table on page 196. 

PERIODS OF EXPERIMENTS SHORT. 

It will be seen from the table that the extent and direction of the 
variations in the coefficients of digestion stand in no regular relationship 
to the method of watering. Sometimes they are greater with this, 
sometimi ¦ with that method of watering, and the variations are observable 
even in the longer experiments. That is certainly true in experiments 
with a mixed diet, especially when all the four horses are 
compared. The result is somewhat different in the experiments with 
an exclusively hay diet, even when the periods with the same method 
of watering are taken together, as has been done in the table. In experiment 
1 with horse 4 the coefficients calculated in this way certainly 
show no variation, because the whole experiment comprised only two </seg>

periods. As already mentioned, in these experiments the difference 

between watering before and after food is more striking than in the 

other experiments. Now both periods of experiments were very short 

(five and four days respectively), and since the daily variations in di- 

gestion and in the composition of the excretions may be very consider- 

able (even with the same method of watering), as shown in experiment 

3 with horse 1, it is natural that these variations should have a greater 

effect on the value of the digestion coefficients of a short period. It is 

therefore quite possible that the greater difference in the digestion 

coefficients in these experiments was brought about in this way, and 

was therefore only accidental. In any case, the differences between the 

other two experiments with an exclusively hay diet are distinctly 
smaller, and indeed some of the coefficients are larger with watering 
before food than with watering after food. It ought also to be 
observed that in all these experiments, however small the difference

may be, in the great majority of cases the digestion coefficients are 
rather greater when water is given after food than when it is given 
before. It would thus appear that the method of watering after food 
is rather more favorable for the digestion of hay. Whether this behavior 
of the digestive organs with regard to the method of watering 
was only an accidental physiological peculiarity of the two horses or 
ought to be taken as representing the rule, is not to be decided by my 
experiments. To decide that more numerous experiments with an 
exclusively hay diet would require to be carried out. What our experiments 
do prove is that this influence of the method of watering, if 
it is at all constant, is so slight as to be devoid of importance, since 
with a mixed diet it was not observable in any of the horses. As already 
mentioned, no influence is observable in the case of mixed diet. 

I I ion the whole, therefore, our experiments show that in the case 
of horses the method of watering has no influence on the digestion 
of the food. With all three methods of watering the ordinary diet of 
a horse, consisting of hay and corn, is equally well digested and absorbed. 
The only question remaining is whether, with an exclusively 
hay diet, the method of watering after food has not some slight od- 

In essential points our experiments have yielded the same results 
as those carried out by Gabriel and Weiske, and this is the more remarkable 
since there are important anatomical and physiological differences 
between the horse and ruminants. On the other hand, our results are in 
complete contradiction with most theoretical speculations regarding the 
influence, of the method of watering on digestion. As has been shown in 
the introduction to this article, most authors would appear to think 
that, theoretically, the method of watering before food is more advantageous 
than watering after, because, so it is asserted, (1) the digestive 
juices are produced in larger quantity; (2) the corn is not, as when 
water is given after meals, in great measure swept out undigested into 
the intestine, and (3) the gastric juice is not inordinately diluted, aa in 
watering after meals. In our experiments, however, it was not observable 
that the method of watering before food had any favorable influence, 
which would appear to indicate that the factors cited in favor of 
watering before meals, at least under normal conditions, exert no 
influence on the digestion of the food. 

Rto the small size of the horse's stomach it is quite certain that 
part of the corn is swept out into the intestine when the water 
after food than when it is given before. That applies to the 
method of watering during meals, that is to say, when the horse first 
consumes his oats, is then watered, and after that is given the hay. If, 
in spite of this, the food is just as well digested, the intestinal digestion 
must be able to compensate for the defective gastric digestion; or, 
under all circumstances, the greater part of the food must first be 
digested in the intestine, which is quite possible, and, indeed, in the case </seg>

            <seg id="p106">
198 


of the horse, very probable, on account of the anatomical arrangement 
of his digestive canal. That is to say, the stomach of the horse is very 
small and the pylorus is very wide and never entirely closed, so that a 
large part of the food must always be carried into the intestine a short 
time after it enters the stomach. On the other hand, the food always 
remains much longer in the intestine, especially in the large bowel, 
where the digestion of the cellulose envelopes, which offer such resistance 
to the penetration of the digestive juices, first takes place. All 
this speaks in favor of the view that for the ultimate completeness of 
digestion the intestine occupies the first place. This would also explain 
why it is that an inordinate dilution of the gastric juice, such as must 
take place when water is given after food, has just as little influence 
on digestion as the passage of a large quantity of undigested corn out 
of the stomach into the intestine. 

AMOUNT OF WATER DBUNK 

Secondly, the method of watering exerts a distinct influence on the 
amount of drinking water consumed and a corresponding influence on 
the amount of urine excreted during the twenty-four hours. Without 
exception the horses drank most water when it was given after food, 
somewhat less when they were watered during meals, and least when 
they were watered before meals. This difference is especially striking 
in the morning, as with the method of watering before food the horses 
sometimes absolutely refused to drink in the morning. 

The behavior of animals in this respect depends upon the intensity 
of their feeling of thirst, which, owing to the rest and the slight loss 
of water during the night, is least in the morning. During the consumption 
of dry food it becomes increased, since during mastication 
there is produced a large quantity of saliva, the water of which is withdrawn 
from the blood and mixed with the food. The feeling of thirst 
must thus be most intense at the end of a meal. The horses, therefore, 
drank most with the method of watering after meals, and when they 
were watered before food they usually drank a good deal at midday 
owing to the fact that they had taken little water in the morning, and 
until midday had had no opportunity to slake the thirst excited by the 
morning meal. (After long continued or severe exertion, with consequent 
extensive loss of water, horses consume a correspondingly large 
amount of water, even when it is given before food.) 

fumuch as under normal circumstances the quantity of urine serd 
depends, in the first place, upon the varying amount of water 
timed, it is obvious that horses will discharge more urine when they 
watered after food than when they are watered before, and this 
actually the case in all our experiments. Considering the quantity 
of water consumed, there is very little difference between the method 
of watering before food and watering during meals, and the difference 
in the amount of urine excreted under the two conditions is correspond- </seg>

            <seg id="p107">
199 


ingly slight. Our experiments would indicate that whenever it is desired 
to increase the amount of urine excreted horses ought to be 
watered after food, so as in this way to induce them to drink a large 

Etw one takes into consideration the fact that our experiments 
on the one hand, that the method of watering has no influence 
digestion and absorption of the food and on the other that the 
quantity of water consumed varies to a considerable extent with the 
method of watering, we may draw the conclusions that not only the 
method of watering, but also the quantity of water consumed, at least 
within the limits of the variations observed, is without any influence 
on the completeness of the digestion. It is true that the differences 
in the amount of water consumed are not very marked, but at the same 
time they are rather important. Whether still larger differences would 
also be without any effect on the completeness of the digestion is a 
question that will have to be decided by further experiments. 

WEIGHT OF ANIMALS VABII8. 

Thirdly, in our experiments the body-weight varied regularly with the 
quantity of water consumed. In all the animals it could be observed 
that on the same day that the change was made from the system of 
watering after food to that of watering before food the body-weight 
sank, and the contrary happened when the change was made in the 
opposite direction. Afterward it remained higher during the whole 
period of watering before food, or lower when water was given after 
meals. To a corresponding degree the average body-weight varied during 
any period according to the system of watering. All this is in 
favor of the view that the fluctuation of the body-weight depends upon 
the richness of the gastric and intestinal contents in water. That it is 
not dependent on the degree of completeness with which the food is 
digested is shown by the digestion coefficients, and by the fact that the 
feces did not vary in composition or quantity according to the system 
of watering. (It is thus only the contents of the stomach, small intestine 
and cecum, and possibly also of the first part of the colon, that 
experience this alteration in the amount of water present in them.) 
Nor can it have been caused by alterations in metabolism, for a large 
and sudden change in the body-weight occurred on the same day on 
which the jethod of watering was altered, while there was no alteration 
in the completeness of digestion; besides, recent investigations 
have shown that the quantity of water consumed, putting aside extremes, 
has no influence on the amount of metabolism. 

In many cases — racing, for example — this method of slightly reducing 
the body-weight by watering before instead of after food might be 
adopted with advantage, since it is simple and does not involve any 
deterioration of the general condition. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

OUTCOME OP THE EXPERIMENTS. 

The practical outcome of the results of our experiments may be 
summed up as follows: 

Horses may be watered before, during or after meals without interfering 
with the digestion and absorption of food. All these methods 
of watering are equally good for the horse and each of them may be 
employed, according to circumstances. It is obvious that certain circumstances 
may make it necessary to adopt one or other method. I 
need only mention as an example that after severe loss of water, such 
aa occurs in consequence of long-continued, severe exertion, the animal 
should always be allowed to drink before he is fed, as otherwise it will 
not feed well. Although all methods of watering are equally good for 
the horse, it is not desirable to change unnecessarily from one method 
to another. Animals, or at least some of them, appear to be not altogether 
indifferent to such a change. We observed in our experimtMits 
that whenever a change was made from the plan of watering after food 
to that of watering before, the appetite fell off for some days; not that 
they did not consume the whole of the food given to them, but for 
some days together they did not eat with the same avidity and took a 
longer time to consume their rations completely. A similar effect was 
not observed when the change was from watering before to watering 
after food, or from watering after to watering during meals, or when 
the change was in the opposite direction to the last. It is possible that 
the method of watering before food, until the animal has become accustomed 
to it, produces a" certain feeling of satiation. Further experiments 
would be necessary to show to what extent, apart from the bad 
effects of an excessive consumption of water, the plan of watering 
after meals acts injuriously on digestion in the case of foods that are 
difficult of digestion or tend to induce tympany. such as grains provided 
with an envelope. </seg>

REPORT OF THE METEOROLOGIST. 

BY GOODWIN D. SWEZEY. 

METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS IN NEBRASKA DURING THE 
YEAR 1901. 

JANUARY. 

Crneral Characteristics.— The month was characterized by high temperture 
and lack of precipitation. On the 1st and 2d the minimum temerature 
was very generally below zero, and on the 10th and 11th the 
lininium was below zero in the central and northern portions of the 
late. These were the only times zero temperatures were recorded at 
11 generally during the month. Most of the precipitation of the month 
eeurred in the storm of the 9th and 10th. Some rain fell at the begining 
of the storm, but most of the precipitation of the month fell in 
le form of snow. The snow remained on the ground but a short time, 
nd the ground was uncovered most of the month. The temperature 
was so high, however, that no damage resulted to fall-sown grain. The 
month was most favorable for all agricultural interests. 

Atmitxiihi rir I'nxxurr. — The mean pressure was 30.15 inches, which is 
0.07 of an inch below the normal for January. 

T mi in in I ii rr. Tlie mean temperature for the state was 26.7°, which 
is about &lt;&gt;.2° above the average. The highest temperature was 78*, 
at Palmer on the 21st, and the lowest, 27° below zero, at Madrid on the 
2d. The greatest daily range at any station was 58°, at Alma on the 
19th. 

I'lriiintnti'iii.—The average precipitation for the state was 0.17 of 
an inch, which is 0.44 of an inch below the average. The largest precipitation 
reported at any one station was 1.30 inches, at Beatrice, and the 
least, none, at several western stations. 

SiiHirfall. — The average snowfall (in inches) for the several sections 
was as follows: Southeastern, 3.0; northeastern, 2.6; central, 1.7; 
southwestern, 0.2; western, 0.6; northwestern, 0.5. The average for the 
state was 1.4. 

Wind. — The prevailing direction of the wind was from the northwest. 
The average velocity was 8.2 miles an hour, which is about normal. 
The highest was 58 miles an hour from the northwest, at Valentine 
on the 15th. </seg>

FEBRUARY. 

General Charactcriatic*. — The month was characterized by temperature 
sliphtly below normal, a slight excess of snowfall, and an absence of 
severe storms or cold waves. Most of the snow of the month fell 
during 1 the first eight days, and was followed by the coldest period of 
the month on the 9th and 10th. The 17th to the 21st was also a stormy 
period, but the snowfall was generally light. The last days were the 
warmest period of the month. The month was very favorable for fallsown 
grain, and wheat appears to have wintered well. 

Atmospheric Pressure.— The mean pressure was 30.22 inches, which is 
0.12 of an inch above the normal for February. 

Temperature. — The mean temperature for the state was 21.4°, which 
is about 2.7" below the average. The highest temperature was 70°, at 
Arborville on the 28th and at Madrid on the 16th, and the lowest, 29* 
below zero, at Gering on the 9th. The greatest daily range at any 
station was 51°, at Gering on the 10th. 

Precipitation. — The average precipitation for the state was 0.83 of an 
inch, which is 0.14 of an inch above the average. The largest precipitation 
reported at any one station was 1.68 inches, at Minden, and the 
least, 0.25 of an inch, at Bartley and Norfolk. 

Snowfall. — The average snowfall (in inches) for the several sections 
was as follows: Southeastern, 8.5; northeastern, 7.1; central, 9.2; 
southwestern, 5.7; western, 8.9; northwestern, 9.7. The average for 
the state was 8.2. 

Wind. — The prevailing direction of the wind was from the northwest. 
The average velocity was 8.8 miles an hour, which is 0.2 of a mile above 
the normal. The highest was 54 miles an hour from the northwest, 
•t Valentine on the 17th. 

MARCH. 

General Characteristics. — The month was characterized by high temperature, 
high winds, and generally excessive precipitation. The warmest 
period generally was on the 17th and 18th, although the highest 
temperature occurred in the northern and western parts of the state 
on the 2d and 22d. The coldest period occurred on the 5th, although 
it was not very cold and about the same temperature was recorded on 
several days. An unusually large proportion of the precipitation of the 
month fell in the form of snow, and most of it fell during the last ten 
days of the month, when two quite severe storms passed across the 
state, being especially severe in the western portion. 

Atmospheric Pressure. — The mean pressure was 29.94 inches, which is 
0.16 of an inch below the normal for March. 

Temperature.— The mean temperature for the state was 35.7°, which 
is about 1.7° above the average. The highest temperature was 87°, at 
Beaver City on the 2d. and the lowest, 8° below zero, at Lynch on the </seg>

5th. The greatest daily range at any station was 64", at Lynch on the 
22d. 

Precipitation. — The average precipitation for the state was 1.90 inches, 
which is 0.74 of an inch above the average. The largest precipitation 
reported at any one station was 4.46 inches, at Stratton, and the least, 
0.40 of an inch, at Whitman. 

Eall.— The average snowfall (in inches) for the several sections 
follows: Southeastern, 11.2; northeastern, 9.7; central, 10.7; 
astern, 16.7; western, 13.1; northwestern, 10.4. The average for 
;e was 12.0. 

Eind. — The prevailing direction of the wind was from the northwest. 
average velocity was 12.6 miles an hour, which is 3.7 miles above 
normal. The highest was 53 miles an hour from the northwest, at 
th Platte on the 12th. 

APRIL. 

General Characterittics. — While the monthly averages of both temperature 
and precipitation were about normal, the month was characterised 
by extremes, the first three weeks being cold, cloudy, and wet and the 
last week warm, clear and dry. Host of the precipitation was rain, bat 
some snow fell the first part of the month in all parts of the state. 

Atmospheric Pressure. — The mean pressure was 30.06 inches, which is 
0.10 of an inch above the normal for April. 

Erature. — The mean temperature for the state was 48.9°, which 
; 0.4° below the average. The highest temperature was 95*. at 
City on the 26th, and the lowest, 5°, at Curtis on the 1st. The 
I daily range at any station was 48°, at Kimball on the 26th. 

Precipitation. — The average precipitation for the state was 2.32 inches, 
which is 0.25 of an inch below the average. The largest precipitation 
reported at any one station was 6.01 inches, at Holdrege, and the least,

VOLCANIC ASH IN NEBRASKA SOILS. 

Associated with our soils and surface deposits is often found a silvery 
white powdery mineral so unlike the soil and other material in which 
it occurs that it excites the immediate attention of every one. The 
constant inquiry is "What is this strange white substance which we 
find on our farms and ranches?" It seems fitting that a public answer 
be given to this inquiry by writing anew for the Report of the State 
Board of Agriculture the following brief paper which will find its way 
to many rural homes, and which may answer questions concerning this 
material better than can be done by many private letters. If you ask 
about the distribution of this powder, or volcanic dust, as it should 
be called, we would refer you for an answer to the map of the state, 
Fig. 1, on which is shown those counties from which we now have

samples of ash. It doubtless ocean i:i tka intermediate counties. 

samples in the State Museum. The same volcanic dust occurs in many 
if not all of the intermediate counties, although those only are 
cated here which have furnished actual samples. The answer then 
as you will read it for yourselves is, that this volcanic dust is found 
in scattered beds over the entire state. But its real limit extends 
far beyond and includes western Icwa, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Kansas, 
Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana and regions farther west. Iowa </seg>

and becomes less white until it is ash-colored. The beds, which are 
thin to the east, grow thicker to the west, the maximum being reached 
in Huerfano county, Colorado, where the reported thickness is as much 
as 600 to 800 feet. It is often called volcanic ash, which is applicable 
and is descriptive of its appearance and is correct enough if you will 
remember that it is not the product of combustion like ash on tinhearth, 
but is instead shattered volcanic rock, or pumice. This fact has 
given rise to the name, natural pumice, which is particularly appropriate. 
Unfortunately the nature of the substance and its orifrin 
misunderstood by the first writers who described it, hence it, often 
goes by the misleading name "Geyserite." although in fact it has not 
the remotest relation to geysers. In addition it has a number of trade 
names under which it is sold, such as Gibson Grit, Diamond Polisli 
This natural pumice is very like the powdered pumice of the si 
Both come from block pumice, which is "volcanic froth" or nut urn I 
glass. In the one case the blocks are ground up by machinery, in the 
other they are ground up by the explosions of the volcano, which carry 
the dust high into the air, whence it is transported over the land for 
hundreds of miles around. The origin of all this volcanic dust, though 
not located, is evidently far to the southwest of our state. The question 
naturally arises, why is not our native pumice as good as the imported 
pumice? Ours costs about $2 a ton while the imported article 
may cost ten to fifteen times as much. As compared with the foreign 
pumice ours is quite as pure, and often freer from silt and foreign mat- </seg>

ter. The trouble seems to be that our natural pumice is more glassy 
and occurs in flat scales. It lacks the minute bubbles, tubes, vessicles 
and sharp polishing points of the foreign product. Hence it is

ton-. It doe* seem that a deposit so generally distributed over the 
should have many uses, and that this natural resource may yet 
be developed to advantage. At present it is used for polishing and 
scouring kitchen ware, and as a base for scouring soap, and it is 
mated that the entire amount sold annually in Nebraska amoun&lt; 
but four or five thousand dollars. Local dealers in almost every I 
put it up in packages and sell it under various names, while three soap 
firms, one in Denver, one in Omaha, and one in Burlington, Iowa, use 
larger amounts. It has been shipped as far east as New York and 
Philadelphia, and inquiries come from many eastern cities concerning 
it. Its chemical composition according to analyses by Prof. H. 11. 
Nicholson, of the Department of Chemistry of the State Univei 
is as follows: Organic matter, 8.75 per cent.; SiO,, 68.91 per &lt; 
( a&lt;). 3.44 per cent.; Na,O, 3.09 per cent.; K,O, 0.36 per cent.; SO,, 8.88 
per cent.; PeO, and A1,O,, 6.12 per cent.; total, 99.55 per cent. Geologically 
this deposit seems to be confined to the more recent deposits, 
and has not been found below the Oligicene, but does occur in beds 
of varying thickness and extent from that point tip to the latest forma-

DIRECTORY OF THE LIMESTONE QUARRIES OF NEBRASKA. 

BT CASSIl'S A. FISHEB, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA. 

information contained in this directory was compiled from field 
¦ taken by the author during the summer seasons of 1889 and 1900, 
while in the fuiploy of the State Geological Survey, under the dire 
rwin II. Harbour. In its publication the writer hopes to furnish 
the public information concerning the location, size or condition of the 
limestone quarries of Nebraska. These quarries are important both 
ma a source of building material and lime. The latter is quite exten¦ 
I in the manufacture of beet sugar, which is a growing inin 
our state. 

¦ limestone formations in Nebraska are the Niobrara, Benton, 
m. and Carboniferous. The surface area of these formations 
ises ;iiH&gt;ut a dozen counties in the southeast corner. The sandijuarries 
are few and of little importance. 

|&gt;reparing this directory the writer is not unmindful that it is of 
it y incomplete. Some small quarries have perhaps escaped notice, 
;w ones have doubtless been opened since this data was obtained, 
believed, however, that all localities of commercial importance 
led below. 

In presenting this material the quarries are grouped with respect 
to the nearest town, the towns being arranged alphabetically. The 
county, township, range, rfhd section are also given, with the name 
of the owner or operator. The size or condition of the quarry is indicated 
by the letters L, M, S, and A, meaning larire. medium, small, and 
abandoned, placed immediately after the name. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE. 

THE GEOLOGICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY OF NEBRASKA 

BT ERWIX R. HARBOUR AND CAS8TU8 A. HBHZB. 

Where there is a wide diversity of interests it is necessary for eitisens, 
including' farmers, mechanics, merchants, students, and professional 
men, to make constant reference to the various authors of the 
state to learn what has been done and what has been written along the 
diverse lines of investigation in which they are interested. In response, 
then, to constant inquiry the following list of papers is prepared, being 
compiled from every available source. Paleontological papers dealing 
mainly with the descriptions have not been included in every case. But 
the list of articles concerning our geography, physiography, stratigraphy, 
resources, water-supply, etc., is as nearly complete as limited 
time will allow. The authors are arranged alphabetically and in brief 
form for ready reference under the title Geological Bibliography of 
Nebraska, and in this connection it will be useful to those interested 
in natural history in general to note that a Botanical Biblography, 
and a Zoological Bibliography of Nebraska have already been prepared 
by each of these departments.

NOTES ON THE LEECHES OF NEBRASKA. 

Among the most common objects of our fresh-water fauna are the 
leeches which are to be found both in abundance and in considerable 
variety in all parts of the state. So common are they in fact that one 
can scarcely draw a dead branch or even a handful of debris from the 
bottom of a pond without securing some of them. No body of water 
is so large and none so small, unless it be purely a temporary pool, 
that it does not afford a hunting ground where these worms may be 
found. On account of their activity and intelligence no less than by 
reason of their coloring, often truly brilliant, they deserve to be 
counted as valuable objects for study in connection with nature work 
in the schools. For this also their adaptability to captivity makes 
them peculiarly fitted, and much wider use should be made of these 
easily obtained and highly interesting forms. 

It is true that their common name of "blood sucker" has given them 
an unduly dangerous reputation, for only a few are able to penetrate 
the human skin and none of those occurring in this part of the world 
can work any real injury to man. Yet it must be confessed that I 
is a certain disinclination to handle leeches. This dislike is dn 
part to the elongated form, the quick movements and the suddenness 
with which the worm makes its presence known among the debris 
which is hauled up from the bottom. I am sure, however, that when 
one has watched them swimming gracefully about in an aquarium of 
clear water, the striking color patterns changing with the rapid changes 
in the form of the mobile body, their right to a place in the na 
study of our schools will be granted at once. Their activity is unceasing 
and there is an air of purpose about all the movements which invites 
study. The perseverance with which they meet difficulties 
cumvent obstacles, outwit antagonists, or make themselves n 
their booty can be noted in any aquarium. And then after a good 
meal they settle down quietly for a nap which may be of long duration. 

• all their habits are equally commendable, for it is not always 
s of circumstances that brings them to devour their smaller 
panions and unless supplied with food the population of the aquarium 
will be speedily reduced to one individual whose size gives evidence 
of his capacity and of his success as a hunter. It must be confessed 
also that their universal custom is to obtain by stealth that which </seg>


            <seg id="p176">
268 


cmn not be acquired by might. If a small water animal is encountered, 
simply eaten up; but if the size of the animal met precludes any 
such possibility the leech endeavors to attach itself at some vulnerable 
point and play the role of parasite by sucking the blood of its temporary 
host. Not all leeches are thus able to change their mode of 
life at will; there are those which never suck blood and there are 
on the other hand such as are entirely dependent upon some host for 
their support. Interesting features of especial habit will be noted 
under the individual species. 

One further particular deserves especial note. On the lower surface 
of many of our common pond leeches collected from old sticks in the 
water in early spring- can be found yellowish masses which closer 
inspection shows to be composed of numbers of separate oval eggs 
or egg capsules. If these leeches are watched in the aquarium it will 
be seen that the young leeches hatch out in due course and are carried 
around for a time by the parent. These young leeches are admirable 
objects for microscopic study as they are without the pigment 
matter of the adult and so beautifully transparent that the entire 
lure can be made out with little difficulty. One can see the blood 
circulating in its proper channels, the alimentary canal, the nervous 
¦ m and sense organs and can acquire a consistent idea of the 
entire mechanism of the bodv. 

Most of the leeches are inhabitants of fresh water and live by sucking 
the blood of higher animals or upon the smaller forms which they 
»re enabled to overpower and devour. This blood-sucking habit has 
been made use of by man for medicinal purposes in blood-letting — more 
to be sure in former times when the annual consumption of leeches 
in London alone reached the enormous figure of 7,000,000. Now though 
less frequently employed they may still be had at drug stores in any 
Other leeches are permanent external parasites on the skin of 
fishes and the relatively few marine leeches are mostly of this habit. 
A few are subterranean in manner of life, occurring in such tropical 
and subtropical regions as have heavy damp earth. Finally it may be 
noted that a few species are found in the forests and even meadows 
of many parts of the earth as true land living forms. These land 
leeches thoxigh comparatively insignificant in size are much feared for 
their attacks on men and cattle and have put whole armies to rout. 
Our own soldiers in some parts of the Philippines suffered greatly 
from them. 

Bll be appropriate here to review some of the salient features 
structure of the leech before proceeding to consider in detail 
ious species which characterize our fauna, and that of related 

¦majority of the leeches are not more than an inch or two 
th but one species reported from Central and South America 
to the extreme size of two to two and one-half feet in length. </seg>

REPORT OF THE ZOOLOGIST. 

269 

The body is always elongated, worm like, and capable of great 
tension so that exact measurements are difficult to give and preen; 
to rely upon since different conditions make so much change in length 
and proportions. One who has seen a leech elongated and swimming 
alxiut in an aquarium or in a pond will often fail to recognize the 
men after it has been preserved, so gTeat is the change in ita 
ireneral appearance. The absence o? hard, skeletal structures makes 
this extreme modification possible and renders it impracticable 
define leeches in terms similar to those used in describing many animals 
possessing a more permanent form. 

The superficial examination of a fresh-water leech brings to n 
the somewhat arched upper or dorsal surface which is at once darker 
and more brilliantly colored than the flattened, lighter and often uniformly 
colored lower or ventral surface. It is also easy to recog 
the pointed or narrowly rounded head or anterior end of the ! 
which is usually in active movement while the posterior end is moditied 
to a round sucker by which the leech attaches itself to the boor 
to any convenient object. This sucker, which is circular in outline 
and in all our species sharply set off from the body by a narrow 
i riction, faces downward and is not perforated by any or 
It is a powerful muscular organ and, though so definitely sep;ir 
from the body in appearance, is in fact hut its highly modified posterior 
end as may be most easily seen in other species, but is shown 
in our forms by the continuation onto and over it of the chani 
istic rings into which the body is marked off. 

These rings, which form a striking feature of the external api 
•aqi in all leeches, are formed by closely set grooves that encircle 
the body at right angles to its length and divide it into parts which 
throughout the center of the body at least are very uniform in sis* 
and appearance. Closer inspection will show that at the anterior end. 
and sometimes elsewhere, some of these grooves are imperfect and 
do not pass onto the lower surface, while at the same time the rings 
which they .mark off are smaller and less distinct than elsewhere. 
The number of rings, which is often difficult to fix with precisi' 
characteristic for a particular form. It is important to note 
these rings, unlike those in the common earthworm, do not di 
definite internal segments or somites, but are more numerous thiui 
the internal divisions, there being from two to six. usually thr&lt; 
five, of the rings corresponding to one somite. The typical somber, 
which varies in different families, can be observed in the middle rt-L 
of the body and is said to be reduced towards the ends where, 
cially at the head, even one ring may correspond to a somite. Tindetermination 
of the segments externally is made possible by other 
features to be noted. 

Thus it often happens, as in many of our small fresh-water letthat 
the markings or color patterns indicate more or less </seg>

            <seg id="p178">
270 


Rernal divisions. Such color spots may be seen on the medicinal 
but here are often somewhat obscure, while in the small turtle 
i sharply defined spots in a row across the back mark the cenng 
of each somite. 

More distinct than these are the papillae or sense organs which 
occur in definite number and In most fresh-water 
leeches they are sufficiently prominent to be easily seen and appear 
in six to eight longitudinal rows along the back of the animal while 
then' are also six less conspicuous rows running the length of the 
ventral surface. These are directly in line with the so-called eyes at 
the anterior end and the latter are really more highly developed sense 
organs of the scries which are provided with pigment and probably 
function as organs of light perception. Some of the leeches are without 
them, but in must they are present although their number varies 
from one to five pairs. Kach cross-row of six or eight sense organs 
marks the central ring of the somite and thus furnishes a clear guide 
for the determination of the number and limits of these parts of the 
body. From these as well as from other evidence in internal structure 
it has been shown that in the leech body there are only thirty-four 
somites of which seven fall in the posterior sucker and twenty-seven 
are in the body proper. This definite and comparatively limited number 
of somites in the leech body is in striking contrast with conditions 
in their nearest relatives, the earthworms, where the number of somites 
riahle anil increases with the growth and age of the animal: the 
fixity is to be regarded as an evidence of higher specialization which 
is also apparent in various features of internal structure. 

A few of the most anterior rings are incomplete and form the prong 
upper lip of a sucker in which lies the mouth-opening at the 
• r of the depression. In the mouth can lie seen the jaws or proboscis 
characteristic of different families, as will be noted later. In 
combination with the posterior sucker, which has been sufficiently 
described above, the oral sucker forms an organ of locomotion. This 
process is carried out after the same manner as the walking of an 
"inchworin." The anterior sucker is fastened, the posterior brought 
llie front, and after it has taken hold the anterior sucker is 
loosened to find a new hold further on. Thus the animal moves by loops 
and with striking rapidity. It is not uncommon to see leeches fastened 
by tlie (Kisterior sucker with the body extended into free water and 
the anterior end moving to and fro as if to gain some knowledge of 
irroundings or to seek out its prey. Most leeches can swim as well 

as crawl, and they carry out this method of locomotion by throwing 
the body into a series of wave-like folds, which propel the animal 
rapidly and gracefully through the water. 

Kie dorsal surface, just in front of the posterior sucker and in 
die line of the body lies the terminal orifice of the alimentary

of small opening*, distributed in pairs, of which one orifice is right and 
the other left of the middle line just in front of the cross-row of sense 
organs noted above, so that a pair corresponds to a single somite of 
the body. There are in all seventeen pairs of these openings and they 
are the external orifices of kidney organs or nephridia. In addition 
to these there are two other openings on the ventral surface but these 
lie in the middle line within the limits of the anterior third of the 
body. These are the openings of the reproductive system, that in front 
belonging to the male organs while the posterior orifice is that of the 
female organs, both sets of organs being found in the leeches within 
the single individual. 

All leeches lay eggs but in different groups are found various methods 
for their protection. The Jawed Leeches, of which the medicinal 
leech may serve as a type, always deposit their eggs in cocoons, and 
these are placed in soil near the water's edge or in a few cases fastened 
to objects in the water. The cocoon is formed by secretion from special 
glands and though at first white and soft it soon hardens and 
gradually assumes the characteristic anther brown. Other leeches, such 
as species of OlosHphonia common in our fresh waters, deposit the 
eggs on the .lower surface of the body where they are covered by a 
secretion and carried about until hatched. Even after this the young 
leeches remain for some time attached to the body of the parent by 
their posterior suckers. From this place they make short excursions 
into the water but retreat at the first sign of attack to their place 
of concealment. 

Mention has already been made of the three jaws which in one group 
of leeches occur at the beginning of the alimentary canal, and of the 
protrusible proboscis occupying a similar position in another group. 
As the jaws may be rudimentary, or rarely entirely absent, the line 
of division is not an absolute one. These organs are followed by a 
short, straight oesophagus which opens into the stomach. The latter 
has lateral pouches varying in number and size; they are most numerous 
and extensive in the blood-sucking leeches, thus furnishing the 
means for holding the large amount of blood taken in, which requires 
some months even for its digestion. These facts are doni 
related with the infrequent opportunity afforded such leeches for 
securing a meal. 

There is present a circulatory system, which is somewhat van 
in detail. A main dorsal and a ventral vessel can be recognized and 
various branches connecting them. A general view of this as well as 
of the alimentary canal is most satisfactorily obtained from the transparent 
young of Qlosrtpkonia which were mentioned above. One of 
these placed under the microscope reveals the main features with great 
distinctness. In addition to the main vessels, the most striking features 
of the circulatory system in this form are the numerous loops 
in the head and in the posterior sucker* as well as the out pocket ings </seg>

Ei-hes possess an apparently solid body, as the body cavity 
related animals is here reduced to a few meagre remnants, 
ordinarily no separate organs of respiration, but the deliwith 
its abundant supply of capillaries functions as such. 

The nwrvoiis system bears a close resemblance to that of the earthworm. 
There is a brain mass above the pharynx which is connected 
-tiort heavy cords, one either side of the oesophagus, with the 
\entral nerve cord which extends the length of the body on the ventral 
and in the median line. This ventral cord bears twenty-three distinct 
oval ganglia or masses of nerve cells. The first and last ganglia 
in the chain, which are really composed of a number of separate centers 
: into one mass, are of unusual size. 

Among- the leeches from forty to fifty genera have been formed by 
• nts of the group; a few of these are uncertain in definition and 
limitation, and many of them are only partially and inadequately 
far as studied our Nebraska forms fall within the limits 
of known genera and for the most part also known species. Some 
uncertain and partially investigated forms will be considered more in 
detail in another place. Here it is the intention to give a brief description 
of the structure and habits of the more common and characteristic 
native species, and include brief references to a few other 
species which for some reason are of especial importance. 

The Hound Jaw Leeches, or (Inut hohdellidae constitute a family 
characterized by the possession of three saw-toothed jaws, one dorsal 
and two ventrolateral; the typical somite here has five (tag*, but near 
both ends of the body this number is reduced. The pharynx is simple. 
Among these the fresh-water leeches form a subsection known as 
ntia, or swimmers, and they may be identified by the presence of 
an eyeless ring between the third and fourth pairs of eyes. 

The subfamily, known as the Ten-eyed Leeches or Hirudinidae, 
which includes the medicinal leech as its typical form, may be coned 
first. The genus Hirudu is distinguished by the presence of 101 
or 102 rings which form twenty-seven somites. The first seven and 
the last four somites are abbreviated. There are only three rings in 
\lll and each jaw bears fifty to one hundred sharp-pointed 
teeth. None of the members of this genus are native in Nebraska, 
but one or more of them are regularly introduced for medicinal purposes 
and thus come under observation here so that some description 
of their characteristics is appropriate. 

Eido medicinalia. the European Medicinal Leech. Length 100 to 
m.; breadth 10 to 30 mm. Jaws large, each with 80 to 90 teeth, 
variable, darker above than below, dirty yellowish brown in tone 
tendency to gray or green; at the margin a bright yellow or 
i band with black margins; on the back three more or less 
nent red longitudinal bands spotted with black. 

The common medicinal leech of Europe is to be found usually in </seg>


            <seg id="p181">

city drugstores in which they are kept in leech jars, living there without 
food for an indefinite length of time. While their use at one time 
reached 7,000,000 annually in London alone, they are no longer so generally 
employed in blood letting. A few serious and even fatal cases, 
attributable in large part if not entirely to carelessness have 
tributed prominently to their decreasing use. A full grown leech will 
suck three times its volume of blood, and a young individual as much 
as four times its volume. During the sucking a clear liquid is given 
off in drops from the nephridial organs. This exudation ceases in 
ten days, but the digestion of the stomach contents requires from a 
year to a year and a half. At the end of two months the animal 
evinces a willingness to bite again, but its capacity is low unless it 
has fasted as long as six to eight months. 

This leech is found native in swamps and pools of Europe, northern 
Africa and southwestern Asia, though in many localities it has been 
so thoroughly collected as to be extinct at present. Many of those 
offered in trade are raised by artificial culture in which it appears that 
the leeches may not be used for medicinal purposes before the third 
year of their growth and have a probable length of life of about twenty 

Iy color varieties are described by different authors, but only 
re reasonably distinct and even these grade into each other, 
are the Gray Leech, in which the back is greenish gray with 
russet red lines on either side, and the lower surface is greenish 
, spotted with black; and the Green Leech, in which the back is 
darker green, often with prominent black pigment, and the 
1 surface is almost entirely unspotted. 

Edo troctina. often confused with the last described species, can 
ily identified by its smaller size, being from 80 to 100 mm. in 
by 12 to 18 mm. in breadth, and by the smaller number of teeth 
i jaw, only about seventy. It is a native of northern Africa and 
and is exported mostly to France, England and America, yet it 
h inferior to B. medicinalis in its power to extract blood. 

Several other somewhat similar species have been reported from 
various countries of the east. They are only poorly known, but are 
similar in habits and use to the two above described. The best known 
is H. nipponica, so well described by Professor Whitman. It comes 
from the Japanese islands, where it is the ordinary medicinal leech and 
is also exported for medicinal purposes. It is smaller and inferior in 
value to the European Leech. 

K genus Limnati* is readily distinguished from Hirudo by the 
; on the jaws and by the ventral furrow which traverses the 
length of the upper lip of the oral sucker. One of its species, 
.i nilotiea, especially in its immature form, known as ffanguituga 
¦a, is of such importance as to merit at least passing notice even 
it has never been found here. The young leeches are </seg>

swallowed accidentally in drinking' and may live for a long time fixed 
in the throat, oesophagus or even in the stomach with serious effects 
on the host. These leeches are common in northern Africa where 
European soldiers and even natives, in spite of their precautions, suffffer 
greatly from their attacks. Cattle are even more seriously affected. It 
leresting to note that this species was known to the veterinarians 
of ancient times as the cause of great troubles among cattle and 
horses. As a matter of fact it is entirely unable to pierce the external 
skin, even of children, as has been demonstrated often, and it is only 
the more delicate lining- of the mouth and throat which it can attack 
¦ ssfully. There are other species of this genus in the east which 
have a more powerful bite and are used for medicinal purposes. 

I laps the most striking genus of American leeches, and one 
is used in some parts for blood-letting, is Macrobdella. In it 
ephalic lobe is smaller than in Hinnin. the rings number 103, 
t least four are found in somite XXIII. Neither the rings of the 
ucker nor those just behind are united on the lower surface. The 
important species is 

Macrobdella decora, the American Leech. The jaws of this species 
contain about sixty-five teeth and the first ring of segment XXVI is 
divided on the margin and sometimes also on the back into two rings. 

The limits in the distribution of this species so far as known are 
from the Atlantic coast as far as Minnesota on the west, extending 
south to Pennsylvania and Kansas. It is not uncommon in Nebraska 
and is the largest of our native leeches, sometimes reaching a foot in 
length by an inch in breadth, although all specimens yet taken within 
Nebraska are decidedy smaller than this. The color above is a dark 
brown or olive green with a row of some twenty red spots along the 
middle of the back, though these spots may be indistinct, and a corresponding 
row of black spots near each margin. Below this leech is 
orange red or reddish brown, sometimes with marginal black spots. 

It is the only true bloodsucking leech in the northern states, and can 
draw blood from the human skin though it usually feeds upon frogs 
and fishes; it attaches itself ordinarily to the throat of the latter, 
killing soon even those which are of large size. Physicians uae it 
frequently in the place of the imported leeches and it is said to be 
equally efficacious, although its capacity is somewhat less. Of its 
habits Moore says that blood "is not its exclusive food. In the spring 
great numbers of frogs' eggs are devoured. In the neighborhood of 
Philadelphia these are sucked from the masses of jelly after the gelatinous 
envelopes have been cut by the leeches" teeth. Large numbers 
of tubiflcid worms have also been found in the caeca" of the alimentary 
canal. Whitman has made an interesting series of experiments 
on its senses and comes to the conclusions that the so-called eyes and 
segment al sense organs do not function as organs of taste or smell 
and that these leeches are not guided by precise sense of sight, smell or </seg>

touch, though sensitive to disturbances of the body of water in which 
they are. 

Haemopis marmoratia. the Horse Leech. Our specimens are small 
and do not exceed 64 mm. in length by 5 mm. in width. They agree, 
however^ so well in other particulars with published descriptions that 
I do not hesitate to include them under this name. The body is deeply 
ringed and of rather uniform diameter throughout, a condition most 
noticeable when the animal is extended in swimming. It varies, however, 
rather largely in shape, owing to the structure of the body and 
is soft to the touch as well as flabby in appearance so as to hang limp 
tthe fingers when held out of the water. When irritated in the water 
s leech draws itself up into an irregular olive-shaped mass in which 
• body is folded together rather than curled up as in the Olossiphonids. 

Apparently it has but three pairs of eyes, on the second, third and 
fourth rings; the fourth and fifth pairs bring small and somewhat 
concealed in the tissue. These inconspicuous pairs are located on the 
sixth and ninth rings. Verrill has given four color varieties, a being 
olive green, spotted with darker bits of the same color, 6 being yellowish 
preen to olive with scattered irregular blackish spots and blotches, 
ng uniform dusky or brownish black, and d being uniform green 
or yellowish, varying to darker green; paler below. Varieties ft and C 
have been taken in Nebraska. 

This is a mud-loving- leech, but when dug out of its retreat, or when 
placed in an aquarium, swims actively with a sinuous movement which 
is graceful and effective. In swimming it becomes more strongly flat- 
I and several waves of motion are included at any one time within 
the length of the body. When confined in a large glass dish with flat 
bottom in which the depth of the water is too scanty to allow of 
swimming in the ordinary manner with the wave-like folds of the body 
in a vertical plane, this leech will turn upon its side and swim about 
the dish with the body on edge, in which position the plane of motion 
becomes horizontal. In this way it is enabled to swim in water only 
a little deeper than the width of its body. 

Of its other habits and food Moore says. "At times it leaves the 
¦ in search of earthworms, which constitute part of its food. 
Various kinds of aquatic insects and their larvae, aquatic oligoch»&lt; 
gastropods and lamellibranchs are eagerly eaten, and large quant 
of mud containing organic matter are swallowed." In aquaria it proved 
radically cannibalistic and devoured entire smaller leeches as well aa 
sucking out the juices from larger individuals. It attacks the legs 
of boys, cattle and horses which invade its haunts and gorges itself 
with blood. 

Haemopis lateral!*, an allied species having a terrestrial habit in 
Illinois, attains larger dimensions; even in contracted alcoholic specimens 
some reach a length of 190 mm., or nearly 8 inches. It has not 
yet been found in Nebraska. </seg>

In 1873 an expedition collected in Nebraska a leech which was described 
by Verrill as Xrphrlis quadristriata ; according to Moore it is not 
the same as that originally described under this name but may be 
&gt;\ mous with Er/mMrlla iiumtntn. The locality given for the original 
discovery was Lake Raymond (lake near Raymond?). Neb. We 
have not been able to identify any of the specimens taken thus far in 
-ka with the form as described by Verrill. 

The land leeches form a special section of this family, being known 
as the Reptantia and are distinguished by the absence of an ejn 
ring between the third and fourth pairs of eyes. These leeches do 
not occur in Nebraska; yet the experience of some of our soldiers with 
them in the Philippines calls for a brief mention of the group and its 
habits. The body of the land leeches is almost round and the posterior 
i is separated from it by a slight constriction only. They are 
nificaat in size, measuring- from two to three centimeters in length 
;in3 capable of extension to a length of about six centi!¦«. 
In diameter the body measures only 2 mm. in front anil I 
nun. at the sucker. The dozen or more species are imperfectly 
known iind only one is thoroughly described. That is the famous 

Haemadipsa zeylonica, or Land Leech of Ceylon. Kings number 
ninety-seven; in each jaw ninety incurved teeth. When gorged they 
have the form of a flask, 1(1 mm. in diameter at its largest part. This 
- very valuable in color and various authors have described 
;il species in different parts of its range; they are. however, ap- 
Mtlv all the same. In general they are found on moist plains, 
mountain slo]&gt;es and in ravines and are the cause of travelers' reports 
of a most astonishing character. In Ceylon it forms a veritable pest 
to natives and to Kuropeans alike. Men have been crippled by their 
attacks and a whole battalion of English soldiers was once forced to 
retire by the persistence of the countless myriads of these insignificant 
assailants. During the dry season they hibernate in the earth 
but ;il other times lie upon the grass, among stones, in shrubs or on 
when in the moist season immense swarms of them are to be 
found. The approach of large animals brings them out and they 
with such rapidity that some observers believe them to be capable 
of springing from the ground, whence the common name of "jump- 
Ing leeches." They attach themselves and suck ordinarily half an hour 
until replete. No ordinary clothing is close enough to prevent their 
forcing a way through to the skin and their numbers are such that 
can not be removed as rapidly as they crawl on. They are common 
in the entire Indo-Malayan region, China and Japan, and recent 
writings from the Philippines give equally wonderful accounts of their 
numbers, activity and ferocity. Their bite is not poisonous, as often 
maintained, but the large number of wounds, careless treatment and 
climatic difficulties are responsible for the ofttimes serious results. 

In the Proboscis Leeches, which constitute a family technically </seg>

            <seg id="p185">
277 


known as the Rhynchobdellidae, no jaws are found but the anterior end 
is modified to form a proboscis which by special muscles may be 
drawn back into the body as into a sheath. This family embraces 
the majority of our native leeches, and most of them, including all 
Nebraska forms yet studied, are not of sufficient power to pierc. 
human skin. The family also includes, however, the largest of all 
leeches, forms from Central and South America which are occas 
parasites of man and are regularly used in blood-letting-. 

Ee most common genus in North America is llloxxiphonia { i 
liarly known by the synonym Cleptinr). The tfetkm of this genus 
usually a broad, flat body and roll into a ball when disturbed, 
typical segment contains three rings. There are one to four pairs 
pe spots. These leeches gather freely on sticks and leaves in 
r and crawl like "inchworms" but do not swim. The eggs and 
g are carried about on the lower surface of the body. A 
non form is 

rssiphonia stagnalis. When at rest it measures I to 10 mm. toag 
mm. wide but may extend itself to 20 or 25 mm. in length by • 

kin width. Color, grayish to tan. and somewhat transparent 
l becoming opaque with age and without conspicuous markings. 
sixty-seven, distinct. Eyes two, large, on ring three. 

This species occurs in Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South A 
ica. In this country as well as in Nebraska it is abundant in all aha 
rs, small streams and ponds. It is a shy species and if drawn from 
its retirement on the lower side of stones, sticks or water plants, it 
crawls about vigorously in search of a new hiding place. It 
chiefly on small worms and snails. The pink eggs are laid chiefly ¦ 
the water warms up in April or May, but some can always be f' 
later in the summer. Castle says that animals which are ke| 
aquaria lay their eggs at night and always complete the process 
single night so that all the eggs borne by one individual are in al&gt;out 
the same stage of development at one time.

white spots which grow in intensity until they unite on the post,

other form collected by this expedition and described by Verrill as 
Clrpninr ornata var. xtellatn I have been unable to verify or to locate in

described below, but the description does not conform to the specimens 
of the latter species taken in this state. The locality from which 
were obtained the specimens described by Verrill is given as Birchwood 
Creek, Nebr.. a place I have not succeeded in locating. The third 
and associated variety of Clepsine ornata, namely var. rugoaa, described 
by Verrill in the next paragraph is undoubtedly Placobdella rugota 
which is treated later in this paper, but this variety does not appear 
to have been collected in Nebraska by the Yale Expedition, nor do I 
find that it has been reported previously from our state. Verrill himself 
surmised that this variety riigusa would prove to be a distinct 

A genus closely related to that just under consideration is Plavvbdrlla, 
and two of its s]&gt;ecies have been collected in the state.

ice warty, but confused and indistinct in arrangement. One pair 
conspicuous eyes on ring 3, frequently united into a common pigspot.

almost am turtle which may be examined. From these places

lines in company with other species, and is said in this environo 
feed on small worms. 

Placobdella rugosa. a closely allied species, is also common here. 
When at rest it measures about 20 mm. long by 10 to 12 mm. broad. 
.n not extend the body sufficiently to become slender, like P. 
parti*iti"i and is altogether the broadest and flattest of Nebraska 
es. The entire dorsal surface is covered with papillae, giving it 
throughout ;i warty appearance, among which one can distinguish 
usually three longitudinal series of warts of larger size and more 
regular arrangement than the rest. One row runs through the center 
and the others are one on either side, about half way to the margin. 
The color of the living leech is most appropriately described aa a 
"pepper and salt" mixture of indistinct yellows, greens and browns 
which are not sharply set off and which show the same light spots 
along the margin as in the last species. The skin is almost transparent 
and thus presents a very different aspect from that of P. paratittem 
which is thoroughly opaque. 

The species occurs in much the same localities as the last; it is in 
habit less active, being perhaps the most sluggish of the group. It </seg>

is also difficult to recognize when obtained as the mud adheres to the 
body and completely obscures the coloring 1 . They are indeed, often 
found in the mud on the bottom of a pond and when kept in aquaria 
bury themselves in a sinilar situation so as to escape notice unless 
the search is carefully prosecuted. If one is taken in the hand it at 
once rolls into a ball and lies motionless: when dropped into water it 
sinks to the bottom before unrolling. In aquaria these leeches manifest 
distinct ¦cannibalistic tendencies, even at times eating their own 
young which have been separated from them but a few moments before. 
In general a group of Glossiphonids' confined in an aquarium 
without food will become reduced in a short time to a single individual, 
which so far as my observations go is of this species. It is also to be 
noted that the leeches in general are more capable of resisting extreme 
conditions than other fresh-water organisms and in a neglected aquarium 
outlive all other animals and plants, even remaining active until 
•the water actually becomes foul. 

There are in the collections of the Zoological Department of the 
versity of Nebraska several other leeches which belong in this family 
and which have not yet been definitely placed. More material is 
desirable and collectors throughout the state are requested to send in 
specimens for identification and comparison. Material from adjacent 
states is also desired. 

In the warmer parts of this continent occur two leeches which are 
so striking as to deserve brief notice. Both belong to the genus 
Liostoma and both are powerful enough to pierce the human skin so 
that the general use of the one for medicinal purposes in its native 
country is not a matter of surprise. 

Liostoma Ghilianii, the giant leech of the Amazon, measures in 
contracted form 19 cm. long by 10 cm. broad, and extended it attains 
to a probable length of 3j to 40 cm. while reports of greater size are 
made by some travelers. 

Rb giant species is at home in the swampy forests of the Amazon 
•rinoco basins. It attacks all animals invading its domain and a 
ndividuals will extract blood enough to kill a full grown horse 

Liostoma coccineum. the Mexican Leech, attains to a length of 8 cm. 
and a width of 2 cm. It is found throughout Central and South 
America and is abundant as far north as Mexico where it is universally 
used as the medicinal leech. In some cases its bite has been followed 
by serious results, the cause for which is entirely unknown. The 
symptoms, which are those of poisoning, may be due to the introduction 
of foreign matter with the bite or to individual peculiarity of the 
patient. 

b somewhat aberrant family of the crayfish leeches, or Branchio»e,

movable dorsal and ventral lips; there are no eyes and the jaws, which 
number only two and bear very few teeth, hold dorsal and ventral positions 
in the pharynx. Our common species is 

Bdellodrilus philadelphicus. Body white, transparent, a little 
broader behind, composed of 16 somites. Length 2 to 8 mm., breadth 
0.3 to 1 mm. Head bellshaped, lips fringed with minute stiff hairs. 

These worms are found often in considerable numbers upon the 
external surface of our crayfishes. One meets them most frequently 
on the lower surface of the crayfish among the bases of the appendages. 
The cocoons of this species are attached to the hard shell of the crayfish 
at some point, and can usually be found on the bristles of the 
rudimentary abdominal appendages. 

There is considerable doubt that these forms are entitled to consideration 
as leeches, and some recent writers place them among the 
earthworms. They are, indeed, somewhat transitional in structure, 
having features which recall both groups and their brief mention here 
is largely a matter of convenience.

BY H. H. NICHOLSON AND T. L. LYON, AOWCULTUHAL 
EXPERIMENT STATION, NEBRASKA. 

The sugar beet experiments were continued in 1899 on land in the 
Platte river valley at Ames, Dodge county, Nebraska. The Standard 
Cattle Co., located at that point, in addition to furnishing land for the 
experiment plots also placed two thousand acres of sugar beets at the 
disposal of the Station for experimental purposes.- This area comprised 
a considerable number of varieties of beets, also soils of different 
character, treatment, cropping, etc. It was thus possible to carry 
on a part of the experimental work on a very large scale. 

THE PROPER SPACE BETWEEN ROWS. 

The most satisfactory results have so far been obtained by having 
the space between the rows of beets eighteen inches with beets eight 
inches apart in the row. This admits of horse cultivation and yet 
brings the plants sufficiently close together to prevent their growing 
too large. A plan that gave very satisfactory results was to allow 
eighteen inches between every fourth row and fifteen inches between 
the others. This plan admits of horse cultivation if a four row seeder 
and cultivator are used. 

Beete planted in hills eighteen by eight inches apart produced a very 
poor yield per acre and a relatively low sugar content and purity. 

Beets grown in twelve inch rows were unsatisfactory on account of 
the necessarily expensive hand cultivation. 

KIND OF CULTIVATION DESIRABLE. 

Kriments in 1899 and previous years have shown that shallow 
tion throughout the growing season is desirable. Deep cultivaries 
out the soil to a greater depth and decreases the yield of 
This is true both on heavy and light soil in Nebraska. Three to 
iches is deep enough to cultivate and hoe the beets. 

THE USE OF BARNYARD MANURE AND COMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS. 

The use of commercial fertilizers and of barnyard manure increased 
materially the yield per acre, but not the sugar content or purity of 
the beets. The advantage to be derived from the use of commercial 
fertilizers is not sufficient to pay for their cost. With barnyard 
manure, however, the case is entirely different, and its use either for </seg>

a previous crop or directly for the beet crop is very profitable. The 
sugar beet should Dot be raised on poor soil. It is one of the most 
expensive, and, under proper conditions, one of the most profitable 
crops grown in this region. The necessity for good treatment is ap-

EFFECT OF CHARACTER OF SOIL UPON THE CROP. 

A very striking difference was to be noticed in beets grown in different 
soils. The fields covered by the experiments included both a sandy 
loam soil and a compact clay. A comparison of these soils for beet

leaf in small, round spots. The spots gradually increase in size and

content of the beets. At time of harvest beets severely attacked pro- </seg>

to a great extent at least, prevented from taking the disease, 
curative was found for leaves already attacked. 

The disease was, in most cases, first noticed and most destructive 
on land on which beets had been grown the previous year. The illustrations 
show two patches of beets in the same field. On one of 
these, beets had been grown the previous year, and on the other soy 
beans had been raised. The two patches were about twenty rods 
apart. The beets on the first patch were very severely attacked by 
"leaf-spot," while those on the second suffered very slightly from that 
cause. The photographs were both taken September 1, and serve to 
show how completely the beets on the infected patch were stripped 
of their leaves. 

Never plant beets on the same land two years in succession. </seg>

rRT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE STATE 
FISH HATCHERIES. 

South Bind, Neb., December 15, 1901. 

Bom. E. P. Savage, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln, Neb. 

EM Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the work 
and improvement* made at the State Fish Hatcheries for the six 
is beginning July 1 and ending December 31, 1901, together with 

a tabulated statement of the number of fish distributed during this 
period. 

IMPROVEMENTS. 

One hundred rods of new fence from east to west entrance to 
grounds; material, five-inch white cedar posts set twelve feet apart, 
fire flat galvanized barbed wires; posts whitewashed. Telephone line 
rebuilt from hatcheries to South Bend, distance one and a half miles, 
long distance telephone installed in residence. Superintendent's residence 
reshingled and otherwise repaired. Second stone dam lengthened 
twenty feet, recemented new cover and railing put on. Hatching house 
floor repaired and interior painted, including all hatching apparatus. 
Six new trout hatching troughs and fifty new hatching trays constructed. 
Four plate-glass aquariums repaired and put in running 
order. Eight large tubs for handling big fish, and new hard coal 
burner purchased for hatching house. Surplus mud and leaves removed 
from all fish ponds. Sundry repairs to barn, shed, wagons and harness, 
together with other slight repairs too numerous to mention. 

DISTRIBUTION OF FISH. 

The total number of food fish distributed was 23,400; total number of 
ornamental fish, 1,150; making a grand total of 24,550. Of this number, 
13,100 were distributed from the hatchery ponds, and 11,450 were procured 
from other sources which is explained fully later in this report. 
Fifteen thousand seven hundred were planted in public waters, and 
8,850 were planted in private waters. While the sum total is a mere 
bagatelle as compared to the fall distributions from the hatcheries 
prior to the year 1899, the fish planted in the past six months have all 
been from six months to one year old and in results will equal several 
hundred thousand fry. 

BLACK BASS. 

Five thousand three hundred of these desirable game fish were 
planted in the past six months, and we still have a large number of </seg>

287 

waters. I have collected an additional number of adult large -mouthed 
bass the past summer and fall, and will devote three ponds to their 
culture the coming season, and hope to hatch enough to supply the 
growing demand. I also intend to procure, if possible, a small number 
of adult small mount bass from Iowa or Wisconsin in the coming 
spring, the adult fish of this variety having all disappeared during the 
administration of my predecessor. 

BOCK BAM. 

Three thousand three hundred and fifty rock baas were delivered to 
applicants during October and November, 1,000 of the total number 
being allotted to our commission, by the U. S. Fish Commission. An 
additional number of adult fish of this variety will have to be collected 
in the spring, as the late superintendent lost practically all the adult 
rock bass while endeavoring to make a fish exhibit at the state fair 

CROPPIES. 

Five thousand three hundred and fifty croppies were planted during 
the past six months, 2,100 of the total number being procured by seining 
a slough near Peru, Nemaha county. We still have a number of applications 
on file for croppies, which will not be filled until next fall. I 
have increased the adult stock of this variety and will endeavor to 
hatch enough croppies to supply all reasonable demands that may be 
made on us next year for this fish. 

STRIPED PERCH. 

Owing to the fact that the former superintendent lost practically all 
the adult perch at the state fair in 1900, only 200 of these fish were available 
for distribution this fall. I have arranged to get a fresh breeding 
stock of perch from a lake near Crowell, Dodge county, as soon as the 
ice melts off the lake next spring. 

CHAIfldL CATFISH. 

Six thousand one hundred and fifty catfish were planted in the past 
six months; these fish were taken in trap nets from the Platte river, 
near the hatcheries, and transplanted over the state. The artificial 
propagation of the channel catfish in ponds has thus far been a partial 
failure, but the ease with which the young fish can be taken from the 
river in the autumn, when they are migrating to the- Missouri and 
Mississippi rivers, makes their distribution a matter of slight expense, 
and this branch of our work next year will be extended. 

WAIX-ETBD PIKE. 

No pike have been hatched or planted from the hatcheries since the 
spring of 1899, and a large number of applications are now on file for 
this fish. The hatcheries are equipped with the latest appliances for 
hatching pike eggs, and I think at least 10,000,000 eggs of this variety </seg>

            <seg id="p196">
288 


throughout the state thoroughly stocked. Pike culture in ponds or 
small lakes, owing to their cannibalistic habits, has been a failure, 
but when planted in large lakes or streams where food is abundant 
their introduction has been a success. 

BROOK TROUT. 

Owing to the fact that the adult stock of brook trout in the ponds 
has become decimated by disease and other causes during the past two 
years we have only collected about 13,000 eggs during the spawning 
season, but I have received notice of an allotment of 50,000 brook trout 
eggs from the U. S. Fish Commission, which we will receive about 
January 1st. I have also arranged to buy 100,000 from a private 
hatchery at Osceola, Wls., which will give us at least 150,000 fry of 
this kind to distribute next spring. The. stocking of the trout streams 
in the northwest part of the state has been sadly neglected the past 
two years, and should now receive the attention they deserve. 

RAINBOW TROUT. 

Bhave about 160 adult rainbow trout in the ponds in fine condition 
will strip at least 100,000 eggs from them during January and 
nary, I also have an application on -file with the C. S. Fish Comon. 
and expect an additional 50.000 eggs from this source. Like 
brook trout, the rainbow trout distribution has amounted to 
ieally nothing the past two years. 

BROWlf TROUT. 

From about forty brown trout in the ponds we hare collected 25.000 
eggs. Small plants of this fish have been made several times in the 
streams in the northwest part of the state, but their introduction 
has not met with the success that has attended the planting of brook 
and rainbow trout, and were it not for the fact that we have a few 
breeders on hand I would favor dispensing with their propagation entirely. 
Experiments have demonstrated that the brook and rainbow 
trout are best adapted to our waters, and the propagation of other 
trout has been largely a waste of time and money. 

sun fish 

One thousand five hundred have been distributed during the period 
of this report They were secured from some shallow ponds along the 
Platte river that were about to dry up. Quite a demand has sprung 
up for sunfish, and I shall devote one pond to their culture the coming 
summer. 

GERMAN CARP. 

One thousand five hundred and fifty carp were delivered to applicants 
for stocking private ponds during October and November. Owing to the 
strenuous objection of anglers and sportsmen, no applications for 
carp to stock public waters have been considered, but the demand for </seg>

Eite ponds is still extensive. Were it not for the fact that carp 
the only fish that will live in many shallow ponds on farina and 
hes, I would favor the discontinuance of their culture. 

GOLDFISH. 

One thousand one hundred and fifty goldfish were distributed during 
the period covered by this report; about one-third of this number 
during the time our exhibit was at the state fair. As these fish were 
received by about two hundred and fifty individuals in lots from two to 
one dozen fish, it would take up too much space to give the names and 
addresses, and I merely show the number distributed in each co 
All applicants who wished to comply with the provisions of the new law 
received goldfish, and we still have about 1,000 on hand. 

RESCUING FISH FROM RECEDING WATERS. 

Owing to the intense heat of the past summer, many lakes, streams 
and ponds that in an ordinary season contain sufficient water to sustain 
fish life entirely dried up the past summer. This wt s notably so 
of the Platte river, which almost entirely dried up from North Platte 
to Columbus. July 19th, in compliance with your instructions, I proceeded 
to Grand Island with the fish car to seine the shallow holes 
left by the receding waters, but upon investigation found we had 
arrived on the ground too late, as nearly all the fish of any value had 
been removed by the people living along the stream. In two days I 
succeeded in collecting about 2,000 fish, comprising pike, catfish, carp, 
and chubs. These were taken to the hatcheries, the chubs being 
utilized as food for other fish, and the remainder of the lot formed 
part of our exhibit at the state fair. 

P September 30th I received instructions from the Chief Deputy to 
fed to Peru and examine a lake or slough, said to be drying up 
that place. Upon investigation I discovered there were tons of 
yet in the slough, although it had been seined almost daily for 
weeks. The major portion of the fish were bullheads, carp, buffalo and 
quillbacks, but in less than two days fishing I succeeded in collecting 
a fine car-load of black bass and croppies. This load was disposed of 
as follows: 300 bass and 600 croppies were delivered to the officers of 
the Humboldt Rod and Gun Club, and planted in Humboldt lake; 700 
delivered to George Mitchell and planted in the Blue river at Deweeae; 
400 bass and 800 croppies were delivered to A. G. Hagadorn and Dr. 
S. H. Razee, of Curtis, and planted in Curtis lake; and the remaining 
200 were sent to J. W. Hann, Wauneta, and by him planted in the 
Frenchman river. There are numerous sloughs and ponds along the 
Missouri river in which the receding waters after the June rise leave 
thousands of game fish every year. I know of no way in which the 
energies of the commission can be used to better advantage than in 
the prosecution of this work. Thousands of dollars are spent every

E along the Mississippi river by the Illinois and Wisconsin comons 
and also the U. S. Fish Commission in this work. It is my 
tion to carry on this work the coming year to such an extent as 
imited means will allow. 

FI8H CAR. 

(Mir fish car is a valuable aid in carrying on our work, without which 
il would be impossible to stock streams and ponds in remote portions 
of the state. During the past six months the mileage covered by the 
fish car, not including switching and transfers, was 2,003 miles on the 
8. &amp; M. R. R. and 1,006 miles on the F., E. &amp; M. V. B. R. Like most of 
the other state property, when turned over by the late Board of Fish 
Commissioners, the car was badly in need of repairs. It is now in the 
I P. R. R. repair shops at Omaha, being repaired and painted. When 
it again appears on the road it will be a credit instead of a disgrace 
to the state. 

AQUARIAL EXHIBIT. 

The Game and Fish Commission exhibit at the state fair, August 30 
to September 6, 1901, doubtless excelled all previous displays made at 
the fair, both in number of fish shown and the excellent condition of 
the live specimens throughout the fair, and was the cause of favorable 
comments, both from the press and visitors. The main exhibit wu 
made in the twenty large aquariums owned by the State Board; an 
exhibit of imported ornamental fish was also shown in twenty glass 
globes. A special feature of the display was the specimens of mounted 
birds: and animals tastily arranged in the center and along the side 
walls, which added much to the embellishment of the interior of the 
building. Considerable credit in connection with this exhibit is due 
Chief Deputy Oeo. B. Simpkins, who worked untiringly to make the 
display a success. Considering the depleted condition of the ponds 
at the hatcheries when I assumed charge July 1, and the fact that we 
did not get positive assurance of aid from the State Board of Agriculture 
until July 15, the greater part of the live fish had to be collected 
during the terrific heat of July and August. The excellent condition 
of the fish when placed on display rather exceeded my own expectations. 


STOCKING PRIVATE PONDS. 

Section 13 of Article 1 of the new game and fish laws, which requires 
that a charge be imposed for fish planted in private waters, is a step 
in the right direction. Some fault has been found with this provision 
of the law by persons who have had applications on file for fish for 
two or three years, but generally the new order of things is being 
accepted without complaint. Nearly every northern state, which supports 
a state hatchery, have repealed that section of their fish laws 
which allowed their fish commissions to stock private waters with 
state fish and have turned this branch of the industry over to private </seg>


            <seg id="p199">
291 


K prise. It has been s manifest injustice in the past in this state 
the whole taxpayers of the state should pay for the stocking of 
rivate waters of a favored few. The charge imposed for fish for 
te waters is merely nominal, being as follows: 

Wall-eyed pike, six months old, $3 per 100; fry, $1 per 1,000. 

Brook trout, six months old, $5 per 100; fry, $2 per 1,000. 

Rainbow trout, six months old, $5 per 100; fry, $2 per 1,000. 

Black bass, six months old, $3 per 100. 

Bock bass, six months old, $2 per 100. 

Croppies, six months old, $2 per 100. 

Striped perch, six months old, $2 per 100. 

German carp, six months old, $2 per 100. 

Channel catfish, one year old, $2.50 per 100. 

Goldfish, 10 cents each; $1 per dozen. 

Seven thousand seven hundred fish have been delivered to applicants 
for stocking private waters during the past six months for 
which the state has received $190.25; 1,150 goldfish have been delivered 
which netted the state $101.45; making a total of $291.70. While this 
amount may appear insignificant, yet it will almost cover the amount 
expended for necessary labor during this period at the hatcheries, in 
addition to cutting off that class of citizens who have applied for fish 
just because the state was conducting a sort of free fish dispensary. 
When the state ponds are properly restocked with breeding fish, I am 
convinced that this branch of the work can in a few years be made as 
it should be, self-supporting. 

CONCLUSION. 

tthis brief report I have made no mention of the needs of the 
aeries in the way of improvement and equipment, which are 
froiis, as I am aware the institution will have to be conducted for 
next fifteen months with the limited amount of funds now apriated. 
I have merely outlined what has been done in the past six 
ths, and what I hope to accomplish the coming year. I assumed 
management of the hatcheries under adverse conditions, and 
her the meagre results obtained during the period covered by this 
rt are satisfactory, your excellency can determine.

KKrORT OP QAMB AND FISH COMMISSIONER. 



REPORT OF THE CHIEF DEPUTY GAME AND FISH 
COMMISSIONER. 

ft Hi* Excellency, Hon. Ezra P. Savage, Governor of the State of Nebratka. 
Dear Sib: I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the Game 

and Fish Commission, together with a report of the number and kinds 

of fish distributed, and improvements made at the State Fish Hatch- 

eries, from July 1 to December 31, 1901. 

The work of the new commission has been attended with signal 

success in the enforcement of both the game and fish laws, and it is 

gratifying to note the widespread interest that has resulted in almost 

every community throughout the state. 

Number of arrests reported of violations of the game and fish 
law, « 

.N umber of convictions 36 

Number of acquittals 4 

Number of cases still pending • 5 
Number of guns and fire-arms confiscated 14 

Number of guns and fire-arms confiscated 

Number of seines, nets, fish traps and set lines confiscated and 
destroyed 143 

Number of game fish liberated from confiscated nets and traps, 
estimated 6,000 

Number of resident licenses issued 2,692 

Number of non-resident licenses issued 40 

Number of seining permits issued 

Number of permits issued to colleges for scientific purposes 6 

Value of illegal fishing devices confiscated and destroyed $1,200 00 

Amount of costs assessed from violations of game and fish 174 90 

EXPENSE OF COMMISSION. 

Total amount of expenses by the commission from July 1, 1901, 
to December 31, 1901, incurred in enforcing the laws and 
including all expenses of the State Pish Hatcheries $4,581 51 

Reimbursements as follows: 

Amount paid to state treasurer from resident hunting and fishing 
licenses $2,692 00 

from non-resident licenses 400 00 

From seining permits 3 00 

From permits' issued to colleges for scientific purposes 6 00 

Amount realized from confiscated fire-arms (proceeds to county 
school fund) 190 00 

Game and fish confiscated and awarded state and charitable 
institution 171 85 

Amount received from sale of fish for private waters and paid 
into state treasury 291 70 

Amount paid county school funds from fines assessed for violations 
of the game and fish laws 886 00 </seg>


            <seg id="p208">
300 


The number of cases reported as still pending are of the most important 
ones we have had. and when finished will result, in my judgment, 
in a large donation to the state school fund. While I have not 
been able to ascertain the exact amount of compensation received by 
the special deputies in every case, as they have not reported in every 
instance, yet the amount no doubt is quite large, and the special deputies 
have proven to be a valuable aid in furnishing evidence to this 
office, in cases where they did not care to institute prosecutions personally 
for business reasons. 

PUBLICATION OF THE LAWS. 

The interest which has been awakened in Nebraska in the protection 
of game and fish is evidenced by the demand for copies sufficed for all 
demands. The past six months your commission had printed 10,000 
copies, of this number 8,000 have been distributed, and the demand is 
still extensive. In addition to the knowledge of the law thus disseminated 
the newspapers generally throughout the state published the laws 
at the time of their passage by the legislature, and when the law went 
into effect, July 1. Under such circumstances ignorance of the law can 
no longer be urged as an excuse for violations of the law. 

CONCLUSION. 

In concluding this brief report I wish to say that the arrests made, 
convictions secured, and confiscations reported only cover a small 
part of our work for the past six months. In many cases complaints 
have been made to this office based on hearsay, which upon investigation 
were found to have no foundation, yet this class of complaints have 
entailed a large amount of expense and work on this department which 
could not be avoided. The confiscation of illegal devices for fishing 
and the number of convictions for violations of the game and fish laws 
have been greater during the past six months than during the entire 
twenty years' existence of the former Fish Commission, and I believe 
the people in general have more regard for the law at this time than 
ever before. 

Eie press throughout the state has lent us valuable assistance in 
ting out localities where the law was being disregarded, and comding 
the prosecution of offenders in every instance. 

Eie officials of the railroads have also materially contributed to the 
ess of this department by extending many courtesies to your 
mission. I also wish to commend the work of Deputy Oeo. L. 
er, who has proven especially fitted for the position of traveling 
ity. Much of the work has devolved upon him in prosecuting violaand 
he has acquitted himself creditably in every respect. 

While I feel that much has been accomplished during the period of 
this report, I am sanguine of even better results during the coming 
year. G. B. SIMPKIN8, Chief Deputy. </seg>

AGRICULTURE IN NEBRASKA. 

The following is an official copy of the Twelfth United tisus 
Bulletin No. 193. To the chief statistician, L. G. Powers, we are indebted 
for advance sheets of data June 17, 1902, to which is added 
data to date: 

GENERAL STATISTICS, 

Nebraska has a total land area of 78,840 square miles, or 49,177,600 
acres, of which 29,911,779 acres, or 60.8 per cent., are included in farms. 

The surface of Nebraska is a high, gently rolling prairie, which breaks 
into a few hills in the extreme west. The general slope of the state is 
toward the southeast, where the elevation above the waters of the Gulf 
of Mexico is about nine hundred feet. From this portion of the state 
the ascent is very gradual, both to the north, along the Missouri, and 
tn the west to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The elevation 
of the entire western boundary of the state is abont four thousand 
feet. The highest point, which is Scotts Bluff, is located a little south 
of where the North Platte river enters the state, and has an elevation 
of 6,000 feet. 

Bsoil, which is very fertile, mellow, and easily tilled, consists of 
and, mixed with clay and vegetable mold of considerable depth 
nusual richness. In the three tiers of counties along the Missouri 
which forms a boundary for nearly five hundred miles, the glacial 
is found to some extent. 

Iraska is preeminently an agricultural state. The fertility of the 
greatest in the eastern and west-central sections of the state, 
the Bad Lands, located in the northwestern part, and traversed 
¦ forks of the Cheyenne and White rivers, are not entirely barren, 
the soil throughout the state contains all the elements mi 
¦iculture, it requires comparatively little fertilizing. 

M'MRER AND SIZE OF FARMS. 

Table 1 gives, by decades since 1860, the number of farms, the I 
and average acreage, and the per cent, of farm land improved. </seg>

            <seg id="p210">

spectively. The establishment of extensive live-stock ranches in the 
western part of the state, and the cultivation of large corn-producing 
areas throughout the state have effected a substantial increase in the 
average size of farms since 1880. The development of the aforesaid 
industries has been so rapid that the division of farm holdings in the 
eastern half of the state, where the farms are more intensively cultivated, 
has not been sufficient to counteract the effect of the expansive 
movement in the western section. In the last decade this increase 
in the average size of farms was most marked. The acreage of improved 
farm land has increased each decade until the last, when, probably 
owing to a more strict definition of the term "improved" by 
the Twelfth Census than heretofore, a slight decrease is shown. 

FARM PROPERTY A5D PRODUCTS. 

Table 2 presents a summary of the principal statistics relating to 
farm property and products for each census year, beginning with 1860.

The value of farm products for 1899 wa» more than twice as great 
as that reported for 1889, but a part of this gain, and of that shown 
in implements and machinery, is doubtless due to a more detailed 
enumeration in 1900 than heretofore. </seg>

irly two-thirds of the counties report increases in the number 
of farms in the last decade, notwithstanding the frequent and severe 
droughts which occurred between 1890 and 1900, causing the abandonment 
of many farms in the central and western counties. 

The total farm acreage increased In every county except Saline, Cass 
Perkins. The decrease in improved acreage reported in some of 
•unties is probably due to the fact, already mentioned, that the 
term "improved" was more strictly defined by the Twelfth than by 
jin-rious census. The average size of farms for the state is 
acres. In the western counties, owing to the number of live-stock 
farms, many of which are more than 1,000 acres in extent, the average 
of farms is greater than in the eastern counties where general 
farming prevails. 

The average value of farms for the state is $4,753. In eleven couni&gt; 
the northern part of the state, the value has more than doubled 
since 1890. Although decreased farm values are reported by a few 
western counties, increases in the value of implements and machinery 
¦re reported by nearly all counties. The average value of the implement 
s and machinery was $305 per farm. In the northern counties 
which showed the largest increases in farm values, the gain in the 
value of live stock was also large. In more than one-sixth of the 
counties this value doubled, and, in the remainder, except in a few 
southern counties which reported slight decreases, it increased no- 

K average expenditure for labor in 1899, which was $61 for the 
varied greatly in the different counties. For fertilizers, the 
; expenditure per farm increased from $0.17 in 1889 to $l 
iost counties reported large increased expenditures. 

FARM TENURE. 

Bi 4 gives a comparative exhibit of farm tenure for 1880, 1890, 
K). Tenants are divided into two groups: "Cash tenants," who 
rental in cash or a stated amount of labor or farm produce, 
lare tenants," who pay as rental a stated share of the products. 

In Table 5 the tenure of farms in 1900 is given by race of farmer. 
ids operated by owners" are subdivided into four groups desig-1 
as "owners," "part owners," "owners and tenants," and "managers." 
These groups comprise, respectively: (1) Farms operated by 
iduals who own all the land they cultivate; (2) farms operated 
by individuals who own a part of the land and rent the remainder 
from others; (3) farms operated under the joint direction and by the 
d labor of two or more individuals, one owning the farm or a part 
. and the other or others owning no part, but receiving for supern 
or labor a share of the products; and (4) farms operated by 
iduuls who receive for their supervision anil other services a fixed 
¦alary from the owners. </seg>

Ehe last decade, when the total number of farms increased 7.0 per 
the number operated by owners decreased 10.3 per cent., while 
operated by tenants of either class increased noticeably. Cornding 
relative losses and gains are shown in the percentages of 
&gt;tal number of farms operated by owners, cash tenants, and share 
ts, respectively. 

Eie total number of farms in 1900, 99.7 per cent, were operated by 
farmers, and 0.3 per cent, by colored farmers. The percentage 
ns operated by owners is relatively greater for colored than for 
farmers, owing to the fact that the Indians, who constitute more 
wo-thirds of the "colored" class, possess land allotted them by 
vernment. 

¦previous census has reported the number of farms operated by 
owners," "owners and tenants," or "managers," but it is believed 
he number of farms conducted by the last-named class is conr 
increasing.

are due, in part, to the fact that many of these farms are large 
stock farms, while others are adjuncts to public institutions.

¦more than one-third of all those in the state, and represented 
one-fourth of the total acreage and one-third of the total value 
arm property in the state. 

With few exceptions the average values of all forms of farm property 
increase with the size of the farms. The relatively high average value 
of livr stork, and the high average gross income for farms under 3 
acres are due to the fact that this class comprises for the most part 
and truck farms supplying city markets, and includes 25 of the 
lists' establishments in the state. For these industries the incomes 
'I less upon the acreage used than upon the amount invested in 
huliriings, implements, and live stock, and the amount expended for 
Mid fertilizers. 

The average gross incomes per acre for the various groups classified 
liy area, are as follows: Farms under 3 acres, $181.33; 3 to 9 acres. 
$45.97; 10 to 19 acres, $21.99; 20 to 49 acres, $11.24; 50 to 99 acres, $7.13; 
100 to 174 acres. $5.32; 175 to 259 acres, $5.39; 260 to 499 acres, $5.83; 
500 to WJ acres, $2.63; 1,000 acres and over, $2.30. 

FARMS CLASSIFIED BT PBINCIPAL SOUBCS OF INCOME. 

In Tables 10 and 11 the farms are classified by principal source of 
income. If the value of the hay and grain raised on any farm exceeds 
of any other crop and constitutes at least 40 per cent, of the total 
value of products not fed to live stock, the farm is designated a "hay 
and grain" farm. If vegetables are the leading crop, constituting 40 
per cent, of the value of the products, it is a "vegetable" farm. The 
farms of the other groups are classified in accordance with the same 
genera] principle. "Miscellaneous' 1 farms are those whose operators 
do not derive 40 per cent, of their income from any one class of farm 
proilucts. Farms reporting no income in 1899 are classified according 
" agricultural operations upon other farms in the same locality.

the several classes of farms the average values per acre of all 
ts not fed to live stock are as follows: Farms whose operators 
their principal income from flowers and plants, $523.13; nursery 
ts, $61.20; fruits, $10.46; sugar, $8.25; vegetables, $6.73; hay and 
grain, $4.62; live stock, $3.95; miscellaneous, $2.87; dairy, $2.03. In com- 
puting these averages the total acreage is used, and not the acreage 
devoted to the crop from which the principal income is derived. The 
wide variations in the averages and percentages of gross income are 
due largely to the fact that no deductions from the gross income are 
made for expenditures. For florists' establishments and nurseries, the 
average expenditure for such items as labor and fertilizers repr. 
a far greater percentage of the gross income than in the case of ' 
stock" and "miscellaneous" farms. If it were possible to preseir 
average net income, the variations shown would be comparatively a

In view of the fact that about half the farms reporting' no income 
for 1899 were owned farms between 100 and 175 acres in size, it is 
probable that this class included many homesteads taken up too late 
for cultivation that year. Some were live-stock farms on which the 
stock rang-ed during the entire year, and the crops of others were 
failures on account of drought or other unusual conditions. There 
were some farms, also, from which no reports of the products could 
be secured, as the persons in charge, June 1, 1900, did not operate 
them in 1899 and could give no information concerning the products 
of that year. To this extent the reports fall short of giving a coml&gt;l&lt;-t&lt; 
statement of farm products in 1899. 

LIVE STOCK. 

At the request of the various live-stock associations of the country, 
a new classification of domestic animals was adopted for the Twelfth 
us. The age grouping for neat cattle was determined by their 
present and prospective relations to the dairy industry and the supply 
of meat products. Horses and mules are classified by age, and neat 
cut tie and sheep by age and sex. The new classification permits a very 
doac comparison with previous census reports. 

Table 14 presents a summary of live-stock statistics. </seg>

CHANGIS IN LJTX STOCK Olf FARMS, 

Tlir following table shows the changes since 1860 in the numbers of 
the most important domestic animals: 

Table 15— Sumber of Speriftei Domestic Animal* on Farnu : 1860 to 1900. 

Table 15 shows an uninterrupted progress in the live-stock industry 
for the forty years succeeding- 1860. Increases from decade to decade 
are indicated in the numbers of every class. From 1890 to 1900 the 
numbers of every class. From 1890 to 1900 the numbers of domestic 
animals increased as follows: Neat cattle, other than dairy cows, 62.7 
per cent.: sheep, 60.6 per cent.; horses, 26.9 per cent.; mules and aiws, 
20.1 per cent.; swine, 8.2 per cent.; and dairy cows, 1.5 per cent. The 
small percentage of increase in the number of dairy cows is probably 
due to a difference between the methods of enumeration employed in 
1800 and 1900. In the latter year, doubtless, many milch cows dry at 
the time of enumeration, and cows milked at some time during the 
year, though not "kept for milk" primarily, were included in the group 
- and heifers not kept for milk," while in 1890 the term "dairy 
cows" was less restricted. The very large percentage of increase in 
umber of "other neat cattle" is probably due in part to the fact 
that 754,500 calves are included in this class, while it is uncertain 
her calves were reported under this head in 1890. 

In comparing the poultry report of 1900 (see Table 14) with that 
-'•0, it should be borne in mind that in 1900 the enumerators were 
icted to report no fowls under three months old, while in 1800 
i eh limitation was made. This fact explains to a great extent 
tin- apparently small increases of 6.0 per cent, and 0.3 per cent., respectively, 
in the numbers of chickens and geese, and the decreases of 45.6 
per cent, and 26.7 per cent., respectively, in the numbers of turkeys 
and ducks. The fact that nearly twice as many eggs were reported 
in 1900 as in 1890 tends to confirm the statement that these decreases 
were only apparent.

; Comprises the value of milk sold and consumed, and of butter and chees* made. 

The value of the animal products of the state in 1899 was $70,227,040, 
or 43.2 per cent, of the value of all farm products, and 56.3 per cent 
of the gross farm income. Of the total value, 69.8 per cent, represents 
the value of animals sold; 6.4 per cent., that of animals slaughtered 
on farms; 12.2 per cent., that of dairy products; 10.8 per cent., that of 
poultry and eggs; 0.6 per cent., that of wool, mohair, and goat hair; 
and 0.2 per cent., that of honey and wax. 

ANIMALS SOLD AND ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED. 

Ps value of animals sold and animals slaughtered on farms in 1899 
$53,530,861, or 42.9 per cent, of the gross farm income. Of all 
ers reporting live stock, 94,486, or 79.4 per cent., report sales of 
animals, the average receipts per farm being $518.83. Animals 
slaughtered are reported by 93,874 farmers, or 78.9 per cent, of all 
those reporting live stock. The average value per farm was $48.03. In 
Kning these reports, the enumerators were instructed to secure 
each farmer a statement of the amount received from salt 
less the amount paid for animals purchased during the year. 

DAIKT PRODUCTS. 

Of the $8,595,408 given in Table 16 as the value of dairy products, 
$4,137,009, or 48.1 per cent., represents the value of such products consumed 
on farms, and $4,458,399, or 51.9 per cent., the amount realised 
from sales. Of the latter amount, $2,393,089 was received from the sale 
of 18,236,897 pounds of butter; $1,664,741, from 23,492,560 gallons of milk; 
$379,188, from 885,056 gallons of cream; and $21,381, from 214,873 pounds 

In 1899, 45,709,648 gallons more milk were produced than in 1889, a 
gain of 31.6 per cent. In the same time the amount of butter produced 
on farms increased 24.1 per cent., while that of cheese produced on 
farms decreased 43.0 per cent. Lancaster county leads in the production 
of milk and butter, Douglas in sales of milk, and Holt in salea

cheese made on farms in the state. 

POULTRY AND EGOS. 

Bster, Saline, Saunders, Gage, and Otoe counties each reported 
an a million dozen eggs produced in 1899, while the production 
state was 41,132,140 dozens, an increase of 76.5 per cent., over 
1889. Of the $7,567,046 given as the value of poultry products, 
cent, represents the value of eggs, and 46.2 per cent., that of 
raised in 1899. 

WOOL. 

The production of wool for 1899 was more than double that of any 
previous census year, and more than three times as great as in 1899. 
The largest quantities reported were from Hall, Kimball, Sheridan, and 
Danes counties. The average weight of fleeces in 1899 was 6.7 pounds, 
and in 1899, 6.8 pounds. 

HONEY AND WAX, 

In 1900, 12,130 farmers reported bees. The production of honey for 
1899 was 866,200 pounds, 16.1 per cent, more than that of 1899, and that 
of wax was more than twice the quantity reported ten years before.

the highest returns per acre were grown upon very highly improved 
land. Their production, therefore, required a relatively great amount 
of labor and large expenditures for fertilizers.

Barley. Buckwheat Corn. Oats. Rye. Wheat 

The middle of the last century marked the opening of great area* 
of land in the west, well adapted to the cultivation of cereals, and since 
that time there has been a steady increase in their production. 

The total area devoted to cereals has increased from 3,502,146 acre* 
in 1S79 to 12,070,961 acres in 1899. The acreage in corn in 1899 was over 
four times as great as that in 1879. During the same period the area 
under wheat increased 72.7 per cent., and that under oats became nearly 
eight times as large as in 1879. The acreage devoted to rye was over 
five times as large in 1899 as in 1879, but, in the same time, that of 
Iwrely decreased 20.1 per cent. 

As shown in the second part of the table, larger crops of corn, m 
oats, rye, and barley were grown in 1899 than duuring any fttn 
year, while the largest yield of buckwheat was in 1889. 

rn, oats, and rye were most extensively raised in the eastern part 
of the state. In the production of corn, which was reported in 1M 
. county, Gage and Saunders counties led with more than 8,000,000 
bushels each. The crop of oats, which in 1899 was an important crop 
in nearly every county, amounted in Seward, Gage, Butler, Platte, and 
York counties to 2,000,000 bushels each. Bye was also raised in most 
of the counties, the largest returns coming from Herrick, Boone, and 
York counties, respectively. Of barley, which was generally cultivated, 
especially in the northeast section of the state, York county reported 
the greatest production. Wheat was produced, with few exceptions, 
i^hout the state. Clay and Adams counties gave the largest yields,

In 1900, 84,849 farmers, or 69.8 per cent, of the total number, 
ported hay and forage crops. Exclusive of corn-stalks, an average 
yield of 1.2 tons per acre was obtained. The total area in hay and 
forage for 1899 was 2,823.6.12 acres, or 14.7 per cent, greater than 
years before. Of this acreage, 79.6 per cent, or 2,248,927 acres, produ

in number nearly two and a half times, plum and prune trees have 
more than doubled, and pear and apricot trees each have gained approximately 
eightfold. 

In addition to the number of trees given in Table 20, unclassified 
fruit trees to the number of 71,485 were reported, with a yield of 6,130 
- of fruit. 

¦ total value of the orchard products in 1899 was $684,751, which 
es the value of 5,212 barrels of cider, 2,163 barrels of vinegar, and 
pounds of dried and evaporated fruits. 

Kthe quantity of fruit produced in any year is determined largely 
nature of the season, comparisons between the crops of the 
t years have little significance. 

SMALL FRUITS. 

The total area used in the cultivation of small fruits in 1899 was 1.171 
. distributed among 7,690 farms. The value of the fruit grown 
was $98,159, an average of $12.76 per farm. The acreages and production 
of the various berries were as follows: Strawberries, 369 acres and 
408,350 quarts; raspberries and Logan berries, 230 acres and 232,580 
quarts; gooseberries, 192 acres and 189,680 quarts; blackberries and 
t wherries, 152 acres and 157,880 quarts; currants, 161 acres and 181,880 
arts; and all other berries, 67 acres and 60,260 quarts. 

VEGETABLES. 

The value of all vegetables grown in the state in 1899, including 
potatoes, sweet potatoes, and onions, was $3,201,228. Of this amount

54.2 per cent, represents the value of Irish potatoes. This important 
crop was reported by 80,607 farmers, or 66.3 per cent, of the total 
number In the state. In addition to the land devoted to potatoes and 
onions 34,044 acres were used in the growing of miscellaneous vegetables. 
From 21,160 acres of this area the products were not reported 
in detail. Of the remaining 12,884 acres, concerning which detailed 
reports were received, 6,219 acres were devoted to sweet corn; 2,216, 
to watermelons; 1,430, to cabbages; 914, to tomatoes; 749, to cucumbers 
653, to muskmelons; 238, to beets; 122, to squashes; 104, to celery; 
94, to pumpkins; and 145, to other vegetables. 

SI'OAB BEETS. 

Though the sugar-beet industry began only in the last decade in Nebraska, 
it is rapidly becoming an important branch of agriculture. 

In 1899. 535 farmers devoted to this crop an area of 8,662 acres, an 
average of 16.2 acres per farm. The total production was 62,470 tons 
of beets, an average yield of 7.2 tons per acre, and the total value was 
$82,258, an average of $415 per farm, $26 per acre, and $3.56 per ton. 

Ke 90 counties in the state, 41 report the production of sugar 
Dodge, Hall, Madison, and Merrick, ranking in the order named, 
d 77.7 per cent, of the total acreage. 

SORGHUM CANE. 

rghum cane was grown by 1,791 farmers in 1899, 4,778 acres being 
devoted to its cultivation, an average of 2.7 acres for each farm reporting. 
The producers sold 12,802 tons of cane for $41,824, and from the 
remaining product manufactured 92,413 gallons of sirup, valued at 32,-993. 
In spite of a decrease in acreage of 61.8 per cent, since 1889, the 
total value of the sorghum-cane products amounted to $74,817, an average 
of $42 for each farm reporting. The average yield per acre of the 
sirup was 19.3 gallons, and the average value per gallon, $0.36. 

The crop was distributed over 78 counties in the state, Jefferson 
county, with 445 acres, having the largest area under cultivation. 

FLORICTLTURE. 

The area devoted to the cultivation of flowers and ornamental plants 
in 1899 was 86 acres, and the value of the products sold therefrom waa 
$142,636. These flow rs and plants were grown by 73 farmers and 
florists. 38 of whom made commercial floriculture their principal bus- 

These 38 proprietors reported greenhouses with a glass surface of 
393,205 square feet. The capital invested in land, buildings, implements, 
ami live stock was $248,805, of which $121,350 represented the value of 
buildings. Their sales of flowers and plants amounted to $125,910, and 
of other products to $1,370, making an average value of $3,349 for each 
farm reporting. They expended $21,120 for labor, and $580 for fertilizers. 
The average gross income per acre was $528.13.

In addition to the 38 principal commercial florists' establishments. 
173 farms and market gardens made use of glass in the propagation of 
flowers, plants, or vegetables. They had an area under glass of 187,786 
square feet, making, with the 294,904 square feet belonging to the 
florists' establishments, a total of 482,690 square feet. 

lOTBSEBLES. 

The total value of the nursery stock sold in 1899 was $234,033, reported 
by the operators of 83 farms and nurseries, 44 of whom derived 
their principal income from the nursery business. The latter had 3,975 
acres of land, valued at $219,690; buildings, $66,810; implements and 
machinery, $7,085; and live stock, $9,325. Their total gross income was 
$243,258, of which $228,408 was derived from the sale of trees, shrubs, 
and plants, and $14,850 from the sale of other farm products. The 
expenditure for labor was $65,040, and that for fertilizers, $280. The 
average gross income was $5,528 for each farm reporting, and the average 
gross income per acre, $61.20. 

LABOR AND FERTILIZERS. 

The total expenditure for labor on farms in 1899, including the value 
of board furnished, was $7,399,160, an average of $61 per farm. The 
average was highest for the most intensively cultivated farms, being 
$1,478 for nurseries, $556 for florists' establishments, $212 for sugar 
farms. $81 for live-stock farms, $49 for vegetables farms, $46 for fruit 
farms, $45 for hay and grain farms, and $35 for dairy farms. "Managers" 
expended on an average, $698 per farm; "owners," $56; "cash 
tenants," $55; and "share tenants," $36. White farmers expended $61 
per farm, and colored farmers, $7. 

Fertilizers purchased in 1899 cost $153,080, an average of over one 
dollar per farm, almost eight times the amount expended in 1890. The 
average expenditure was $15 for florists' establishments, $7 for vegetable 
farms, $6 for nurseries, $4 for sugar farms, and $1 for hay and 
grain, live-stock, and dairy farms. 

IRRIGATION STATISTICS. 

Ebraska, having an extreme length from east to west of 450 miles, 
n two distinct regions — one humid and the other arid. East of the 
hundredth meridian the rainfall is usually sufficient for the sucul 
cultivation of all crops, although some extensive irrigation syshave 
been established in this section, 31,805 acres having been 
ated there in 1899. 

The western or arid portion of the state is typical of the Great Plains 
country. The rainfall is variable, but always deficient, and the snowfall 
usually light, while the climate is generally hot in summer and 
cold in winter. It is in this section of the state that irrigation has 
reached its greatest development. 

The Platte, Kansas, and Niobrara rivers, draining portions of the arid 
region, furnish the water supply for practically all the irrigation sys- </seg>

terns. Nearly 90 per cent of the irrigated area of the state is found 
within the drainage basin of the Platte. This steram has two twill 
high up in the Rockies in Colorado, the North Fork flowing northward 
into Wyoming, and thence, in a general easterly direction, into Nebraska. 
The South Fork, after following a general easterly course 
through Colorado, flows through Nebraska for a distance of 80 mtlf 
to its junction with the North Fork at North Platte. 

The valley of the North Platte is deep and broad and surrounded by 
wide areas of table-lands, smooth or very gently rolling, and sloping 
toward the east. The slopes along the sides of the river are irregular, 
changing from broad flat lands, lying nearly level with the river, to 
terraces rising to a height of 200 feet. Back of these terraces are 
the high, steep-sided table-lands. The flow of the North Platte is 
greater and more constant than that of the South Platte, so much 
water being diverted from the latter in Colorado, that its channel in 
Nebraska is dry for a portion of the year. In the fertile valley through 
which the North Platte flows in Scotts Bluff, Cheyenne, Deuel, and 
Keith counties, several large canals have been constructed and irrigation 
has been extensively developed. Below the junction of the North 
and South Platte, the main stream contributes water to some of the 
largest and most important irrigation systems in the state. 

The counties in southwestern Nebraska bordering on Kansas are 
drained by the Republican river, a tributary of the Kansas. This stream 
has its sources in the Colorado plains and is intermittent in flow. In 
1899 about 9,000 acres were irrigated from ditches supplied by the 
Republican and its tributaries. 

ee irrigation development has taken place in the extreme northn 
part of the state along the White river and its branches. Most 
ditches are small and of private ownership. 

Niobrara river, a stream of considerable importance, rises in the Pine 
Ridge in northwestern Nebraska, and flows across the northern tier 
of counties into the Missouri at Niobrara. It has a fall of about three 
feet to the mile and its valley is rarely more than one-half mile in 
§with regular slopes and an elevation of about 400 feet above the 
Platte. Throughout the greater part of the year there is water 
channel of this stream. In 1899 the ditches diverting water from 
ibrara river irrigated 7,317 acres. 

The collection of statistics relating to irrigation in Nebraska has 
been attended with considerable difficulty. The year of 1899 was one 
of severe drouths, and, owing to the scarcity of the water supply, 
many of the ditches were abandoned or operated only during the early 
portion of the season. In many sections of the state, crops which 
received but one irrigation were not reported by the enumerator aa 
irrigated, and it is exceedingly probable that a very large acreage of 
land partially irrigated is not included in the census report. In the 
same manner many irrigation systems which were not successfully 
operated in the census year have been omitted from the report*. </seg>

In the decade from 1889 to 1899, the number of farmers who irrigated 
all or a portion of, their land increased more than eight times, while 
the total acreage irrigated in the state was nearly thirteen times as 
great in 1899 and 1889. Deuel county records the greatest relative gains 
in both the number or irrigators and the number of acres irrigated, 
the former having increased twenty-fourfold and the latter ninety-three 
fold. Dawson county has the largest number of irrigators, while Si 
Bluff county reports the greatest acreage irrigated in 1899. 

An examination of the above table indicates that irrigation is being 
extended over widely distributed areas. It is probable that as its 
benefits are more fully appreciated, the construction of irrigation systems 
will rapidly follow in all sections where water in sufficient quan 
can be diverted without involving too great expense. 

Table B presents the statistics of the crops grown on irrigated land

The cost of construction per mile of ditch in Nebraska is high in 
comparison with other sections having a similar topography. Thii is 
explained by the fact that many of the systems are of large dimensions, 
and the number of small ditches of private ownership is fewer in proportion 
to the number of irrigators than in other western states. It 
is probable that the cost of many large canals has been reported in 
m of the amount actually expended. The large streams flow in 
narrow valleys considerably below the surface of the plain, and in 
order to get the water out upon broad areas, canals of great length are 
required. This also explains the small number of acres — 83 irrigated 
per mile of ditch. 

While no comprehensive investigation has been made of the state's 
geological structure to ascertain the prospects for underground water. 
Prof. X. H. Darton of the Geological Survey has made a report based 
on Nebraska fieldwork in 1897. His investigation was made of the 
region west of the one hundred and third meridian, and included the 
counties of Scotts Bluff, Banner, Cheyenne, Box Butte, Dawes, Kimball. 
and Sioux, comprising an area of 7,400 square miles. The report states 
that the relations of underground waters there present a variety of 
features, there bing large supplies at moderate depths in many localities, 
while in others the amount of water within reach of the average 
farmer is so small as to seriously interfere with the settlement of very 
extensive areas. This has been the case particularly where large volumes 
of water were needed for cattle. In the flats adjoining the river </seg>

in the Platte Valley, and in the Lodgepole Valley, a good supply of 
water can usually be obtained from wells varying in depth from ten 
to forty feet; on the table-lands on either side of the Lodgepole, large 
volumes are secured at depths ranging from one hundred and fifty to 
three hundred feet. In the Niobrara Valley water is obtained from 
shallow wells in the narrow strips of alluvial deposits near the river, 
while back on the table-lands, a plentiful supply is found at depths 
ranging from fifty to three hundred feet. In the sand hills water 
accumulates in basins at moderate depths so that shallow wells ordinarily 
obtain satisfactory supplies. 

Where the well system is employed, water is pumped by windmills 
into reservoirs and thence diverted to the areas cultivated. In 1899, 
843 acres were irrigated in this manner, nearly half of the area being 
located in the refirion described above </seg>

AGRICULTURE IN OUR SCHOOLS. 

E. A. Bl'RXETT. DIRECTOR OF THE -NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION. 

The benefits to be derived from agricultural education in our schools 
can best be considered by noting 1 some of the changes in the condition 
of the farmer today compared with those of the past. The demand 
for such education has grown with our industrial development and the 
application of science to agricultural processes. 

lern science applied to agriculture has produced improved varieof 
our fruits and grains, and has increased their production. It 
has improved our lypi's of domestic animals for specific purposes, 
has taught us how to combat diseases and insect pests, and how to 
nurture the, plant and the animal to secure their best development, 
ice has taught us how to conserve the moisture and keep up the 
fertility of the soil. We have learned that what appears to be a 
mass of inert material is really a laboratory in which soil bacteria 
are at work to liberate the food for plants. As these lower forms of 
life are subject to physical laws, the farmer can help or hinder the 
processes of decomposition by which plant food is set free, and his 
success in operating land through long periods of years must depend 
upon his knowledge of the laws governing soil fertility and the connervation 
of soil moisture. 

We find in agriculture, as in other lines of business, a willingness to 
pay for the superior quality of a product. The profit lies in supplying 
this demand. Here again the application of science has affected production. 
Our choices grades of butter and cheese are made possible 
by our knowledge of bacteriology. Their flavors are due to the action 
of specific germs which can only be developed under accurately controlled 
conditions, while their texture and quality are due to skillful 
processes of manufacture. 

In the development of our improved breeds of animals, scientific 
knowledge of the laws of reproduction and the processes of nutrition 
have been essential factors. The animal becomes plastic in the hands 
of the skillful breeder, who is able to perfect it along lines in which 
it has inherited tendencies. Not only has the breeder secured greater 
economy of production but he had succeeded in fixing these characters 
in animals so that they are transmitted through the progeny from 
generation to generation. Thus the dairyman has developed a dairy 
type of animal capable of producing butter at a lower cost than her 
undeveloped competitor. The breeder of beef cattle has been able to 
develop beef form so as to secure the largest percentage of dressed 
weight in the animal with the highest quality of beef. He has developed 
early maturity along with thickness of flesh, thereby increasing 
the "economy of the production. 

If progress in agriculture has been slower than in other lines of 
industry, it is only because the processes involved have been more 
intricate and complex and the securing of knowledge has been more 
difficult; but. comparing present methods with those of a generation 
ago. we find that progress has been constant and great. Machinery 
has been perfected and everywhere we require lesp human energy and 
greater skill and a broader knowledge of the principles involved. 

The value of special training 1 in agriculture, for men who are to </seg>

follow this vocation, is readily admitted, but the means of adjusting 
our present educational machinery to fit this end is a proper subject 
for discussion. Elementary sciences have been introduced in the 
schools and are in the main well established. The recent efforts to 
encourage observation in the pupil, through the introduction of nature 
studies in the lower grades, have been entirely successful. A study of 
the germination of the seed and the development of the plant has 
proven to be full of interest to the child and acts as a stimulus to 
accurate observation and research. In like manner the transformations 
of insect life are studied with an interest not always given to the 
study of books. Much can be done in this way to create in the child 
an interest in the things he may see about him. Nature studies as 
taught in the best schools do much to intensify the child's love of 
nature and to enlarge the visible world about him. The study of 
agriculture as it would be carried on in the lower grades would differ 
but slightly from nature studies as now taught. Nature study methods 
might be pursued. Elementary subjects having an economic bearing 
upon agriculture should be chosen. In the fifth and sixth grades 
books might be used explaining the growth of common plants such as 
alfalfa, Indian corn, or the common plants of the garden. 

In ( itTiiianv, Sweden, and some other European countries the schoolmaster 
formerly received the use of a plat of ground in addition to 
his meager salary. These gardens have now been turned into industrial 
laboratories, where the pupil may Watch the growing of new 
plants or the effect of different methods of cultivation on the crops. 
These country schools have really become agricultural schools on a 
very limited scale. 

In our common schools the elementary principles of physics are already 
taught. The teacher might easily apply these principles to the 
properties of the soil. In this way he might teach that water rises 
through the soil by capillary attraction; that soils of different texture 
have different water-holding capacity; that soils rich with humus best 
withstand drouth; that cultivation cuts off the capillary power of soils 
below the surface and thus retains the water for the use of the crop. 
The teacher might continue at length to explain and illustrate these 
scientific facts until the pupil had a very good understanding of the 
physical properties of the soils. 

In the study of botany the importance of the selection of seed 
value of different varieties, the influence of cultivation upon the plant 
and many other economic problems might be taught. In the study of 
ph\ siology and zoology something could be done to explain how it is 
possible, through selection and environment to mould the animal form 
and harmonize it to some specific purpose. If the pupil could be 
taught no more than the relation of food supply to animal produ 
and the effects of insufficient food upon the size and quality of breeding 
animals, much would be accomplished. 

In a state whose resources are almost wholly agricultural and whose 
people are largely dependent upon the products of the soil for their 
support it is peculiarly fitting that the trend of education should be 
in line with her greatest industries. It is a matter of importance 
that young men and young women who are to return to the farm 
shall have some opportunity to learn at least the rudiments of the 
vocation they practice. Where a large percentage of the pupils of the 
country schools go back to the farms it would seem natural that many 
of these pupils, with proper encouragement, might be induced to continue 
their studies for a short course in some secondary school where 
a technical study of agricultural subjects might be pursued. In this </seg>

secondary school such text-books as "Principles of Agriculture," by 
L. 11. Hai lev, might be used. This book contains an application of some 
ui the principal laws of physics, botany, chemistry and biology to 
ulture. i he subject is presented in such a way that the scientist 
would be interested in it iroin the standpoint of pure science, and the 
farmer would be equally interested irum the standpoint of pure agri- 

-tfultun-. This book is i.ut introductory to a series of books known as 
the iiural Science Series and the Garden Craft Series, each of which 
contains many valuable books. Any of these books can be comprehended 
by pupils above the ninth grade and many of them are in use 
in the schools of agriculture in other states. Doubtless some of the 
books which would best meet our wants are not yet written, but they 
Will be written when the demand for them is apparent. A new book 
in horticulture will be needed to meet our western conditions, also a 
book on feeding animals which shall be simple in its statements yet 
ntitically correct. 

1 lie benelits to be derived from the introduction of agricultural 
¦cts into our secondary schools will be found in the greater 
adaptability of the secondary school to the needs of the agricultural 
classes. The courses as now arranged in our high schools are shaped 
to guide the pupils into University courses and away from agricultural 
pursuits. This is but a natural result of the present machinery of 
education. With properly adjusted educational machinery, it would 
be equally easy to guide many boys and girls into schools of agriculture. 
The University of Nebraska is now perfecting such a plan, and 
is soon to put it into operation. Already it has a well-equipped school 
of agriculture in successful operation. 

The complaint has been made that our system of agricultural education 
did not produce farmers, that its tendency was rather to turn 
out professional men who evade labor and shun agricultural pursuits, 
in reply it can be said that no method can be prescribed which will 
make the farm certainly attractive to all farm boys, but that no 
method will serve so completely to drive the boys away from the farm 
as the attitude which is devoid of all intelligent interest in progressive 
methods of farming. If you would dignify labor and make farm life 
attractive, you must give the boy that knowledge and skill which makes 
it possible for him to carry on a successful business enterprise. If 
n mild draw him toward agricultural pursuits, you must give him 
a fuller knowledge of the light which modern chemistry, biology and 
physics have thrown upon the operations of the farm. Teach him to 
love perfection in the products which come from his hand. Teach him 
to grow the choicest fruits and grains and the most perfect types of 
animals, because of the superior skill he has acquired in their production. 
Put the trade mark of quality on the product* which come from 
the farm and you remove from it the aspect of drudgery and make it 
attractive to ambitious young men. 

The development of our great arteries of commerce has made competition 
world-wide. A larger knowledge of agricultural economics and 
tne study of the vast resources of the soil should give the boy a respect 
for farming which has possibly not hitherto entertained. One-half the 
exports of the United States consists of products of the soil, and our 
own people — approximately 75,000,000 — are fed before the surplus is 
sent abroad to feed the world. Surely in this vast industry there 
should be opportunity to utilize the energies of the most ambitious 
young men. 

A matter of great importance to agricultural welfare of the country 
is the attitude of the trades and professions and of the farmer himself 
toward the social status of the rural class. The farmer is much in- </seg>

            <seg id="p239">
331 


Bto belittle his own vocation and to consider himself inferior in 
position to the tradesman. With this attitude on his part it is 
wonder that his children feel a desire to desert their father's 
X and become clerks and small traders in the hope that tinre, 
their social condition. One of the greatest boons of ;i_ 
education to rural life will be the tendency to plaoe the f 
is family on an equal footing 1 educationally and socially with the 
people of other trades. We need often to remind ourselves of the 
fact that the vigor, virility and the independence of country life must 
continually be drawn upon to maintain the strength, the acumen and 
the moral tone of the city. If the sons and daughters of the farmer 
can impart the industry, the moral stamina, and the business m 
which city life does not give, then surely there must be some inlv 
virtue in the isolation, the association with nature, and the independent 
life of the farm. There must be some inherent virtue in daih 
intelligently performed which makes it honorable among all men: 
some subtle influence which, as it steels the arm. gives moral «!&gt;• 
the man. We need to encourag/e a broader education of the rural 
classes and bring them more in contact with men. We need to stimulate 
them to a keener appreciation of the competition which is sh.i 
all industrial life: but. above all, we need to impress the fact that 
the trained man who succeeds. 

A study of agriculture in the schools, or elsewhere, makes it pofor 
the farmer to discriminate more accurately in the adoption of 
methods, and to select the best among many offered. The edu. 
farmer does not despise theories, but he studies the experience of 
other men, whether from books or from actual life, in an effoacquire 
knowledge which he can adapt to his own conditions. This 
study of the principles introduced into farm operations stimulate 
desire for information and goes far toward making him a thorough 
ness man. It cannot be supposed that this training will make • 
man equally successful, but it is safe to say that such a man will be 
more successful than he would otherwise have been. All these opportunities 
mav not keep the farmer's son interested in the farm: 
If an opportunity to secure stich knowledge comes to the young man in 
schools which are surrounded by an atmosphere and environ' 
favorable to f;irm life, they will go far towards satisfying him that 
agriculture n&gt;-ed not be divorced from general culture, and that agricnltural 
education is the avenue through which the higher ideals &lt;¦•' 
American furmer must be reached. The agricultural school is the 
farmer's business college. 

EXTENSION OF THE MARKET FOR BEEF-BRED SI i 

E. A. BURNETT, DIRECTOR NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION. 

A study of the market for pure bred sires cannot be separated from 
a study of beef production, because those factors which affect 
price of beef always have a similar effect upon the market for 
bred sires. High prices for beef always stimulate the demand for pure 
bred beef cattle of both sexes, and low priced beef has a depressing 
effect upon the sale of pure bred cattle. 

If, then, the general prospect for prices of beef are good, one may </seg>

            <seg id="p240">
332 


look forward to an expanding market for beef sires. I do not mean 
by this that prices will increase, for the careful student of the live 
stock business cannot fail to realize that the geometrical ratio of 
increase makes it possible to produce any class of animals so rapidly 
that the demand will not long exceed the supply. With the increasing 
supply, the tendency of prices on pure bred beef cattle may be expected 
to be downward rather than upward until it reaches a level 
where only the best breeders are producing these cattle at a profit. 
Nothing can be more unfortunate for the beef producing industry at 
any time than a sudden inflation of prices in bulls, which of itself cut« 
off the market for many animals that would sell at a lower prioe. I 
contend that it is much better for the breeders of registered cattle to 
sell 10,000 bulls at $125 per head than to sell one half that number at 
$200 per head. 

restriction can be placed on the production of registered cattle 
other than that of supply and demand, regulated in turn by the profits 
in the business. If then the general tendency of the market is to seek 
a scale of prices paying only moderate profits, the safety of all 
breeders rests only in the superior skill they may possess to breed 
animals of high quality. The breeding of cattle is a business requiring 
a high degree of skill, an accurate knowledge of the fundamental 
principles of reproduction and a good fund of business sense. The 
man who combines these qualities in a high degree has an opportunity 
II his skill and business sagacity at a reasonable price through 
the production of superior breeding animals, but the man who lacks 
these qualities and still buys pedigreed cattle in the expectation of 
becoming a breeder is likely to be sorely disappointed and eventually 
to find that there is larger profit and less risk in the improvement ot 
grade cattle for the production of beef. 

Beef breeds have been built up by a long period of selection and 
environment, in which the skill of some of our greatest artists, has 
been exerted to fix a type which would perpetuate itself and impress 
its qualities on succeeding generations. But with all this exercise of 
skill, no breeder has been able to fix a type which would maintain 
itself independent of selection or in the face of adverse surroundings. 

Brtension of the market for beef-bred sires seems at present to 
ts greatest stimulus from the high price of finished beef and 
pective continuance of good markets. This belief in the conof 
remunerative prices of beef is based upon the decreasing 
&gt;f beef cattle in proportion to population. While this is by 
is an absolute guide it is certain that there is no large area 
land in the United States, either being opened or in prospect 
[ opened for range purposes. The carrying capacity of the 
ranges has been reduced more than forty per cent since 1883 
and with the ravages of disease and the high risk from exposure and 
starvation, the open range is no longer a serious competitor of the 
stock farmer. This may be a matter of regret to many of the breeders 
of pure bred bulls who have found large markets in the range country 
but it is one of the factors which will prevent the enormous expansion 
of beef cattle on the open range. The ranchman will continue to 
breed many cattle and to require a large and possibly increasing 
number of pure bred sires, but these ranges are now stocked to the 
limit, except where irrigation or expensive wells may furnish increased 
food or water supply. 

Hijrh price in beef, while it affects all grades of cattle, is most seen 
in the l&gt;est grades where the results of good breeding are combined 
with the best methods of feeding. It therefore stimulates the production 
of a better quality of feeders and the consequent use of better </seg>

When the best steers are selling around four cents per pound 
there is little incentive to pay a high price for feeding steers n&gt; 
f\|)«nil money on sires for purposes of improvement of the herd in the 
farming country even though at such times only the best steers pay 
aaj profit. But with the best finished steers selling' at six cents or 
¦ there is an incentive to purchase good beef sires which will transmit 
quality, thick flesh and early maturity to their progeny. 

If we wish to see the effect of good blood on the quality of beef 
cattle under conditions not always favorable to the development of 
&lt; I ua I it \ or beef form, we have but to study the improvement of herd» 
nn the western range where food supply is often short and the supply 
i'f water limited, or only found at a point several miles from the food 
supply. In spite of this fact the use of only a moderate class of pure 
bred sires has so modified these herds that in two or three genenr 
the steers produced in the range country have lost most of the chariicteristics 
of the native Texan and have taken on the markings and 
much of the quality of the better bred sire. This is specially noticed 
if the calves are taken at weaning time before they have been innured 
to hardship and are carried on with a good supply of food until they 
are mature. In the state of Nebraska and doubtless in all the states 
bordering on the western ranges it is impossible to pick up a bunch of 
500 steers in the farming country which possess as great uniformity &lt;&gt;r 
an high individual excellence as can be found in a selected bunch of 
range steers of equal numbers. Xo class of men have been so qui' 
recognize the effect of good blood as the ranchmen of the western 
¦ and it is safe to say that could their domain be extended it 
would increase the market for pure bred bulls more rapidly than the 
extension of any other beef-producing area. 

The natural conditions which have prevented this great grazing ares 
from developing into a farming country has also operated to 
come much of the benefit of the good blood introduced, by sujecting 
the animals to a period of starvation and exposure alternating 
a period of pletity. So that even while the young calf coming from the 
range may show many marks of his pure bred sire, if matured on the 
range he shows fewer of these traits, until put into the feed lot 
where the latent tendencies to produce beef may in a measure develop. 
The need of a constant supply of good blood is apparent when we 
visit the stock yards and see the little impression made by the good 
blood already introduced. The picture of sharp backs, bare ribs and 
prominent horns which are ever predominant in such a scene may be 
lung remembered. Yet the leaven has been at work and the impr 
ment resulting makes more apparent the continued need of such b 
to counteract the influence of bad environment. If so much is said 
against the range cattle and if it is still possible to secure better and 
more uniform steers from the ranges than from the cultivated farms, 
it speaks forcibly for the need of pure bred sires in the improvement 
of farm cattle. 

The breeders of cattle on the cultivated farms of the Missouri valley 
have been slow to appreciate the value of good blood and have permitted 
the ranchmen to outstrip them in the effort to produce a . 
of cattle. This has been due to a condition of agriculture li 
which bent all its efforts toward grain production upon land 
which w;is intended for the production of live stock. The drought 
It devnsted the crop of the farmer and destroyed the feed of the 
ranchman. A period of readjustment was required, since which 
small herds of cattle have sprung up on many farms. These cattle are 
intended to consume the residue products of the farm and marki </seg>

grown on the cultivated farms in competition with range cattle. 
The period is now at hand when the small cattleman must learn that 
he can afford to pay as high prices for good bulls as his ranchman 
neighbor. He has cattle enough to pay for the investment as well as 
the ranchman, for with 1,000 cows the ranchman must furnish one bull 
for each twenty-five females where they run on the open range, while 
under farm conditions the bull is much more useful. 

Ii e western farmer must learn that, while his cattle are kept to 
ume coarse products and market his corn, a continuous food 
&gt;ly is necessary to economical production of beef. When he has 
oughly learned this, and has adapted his system of farming to 
needs of his cattle by growing more grass and less corn, he will 
eciate more the value of good blood and become a better customer 
pure bred bulls. 

Continuous food supply cannot receive too much attention at the 
hands of the breeder and feeder. The breed does not exist which will 
develop rounded form and thick flesh on a scanty supply of food. 
Steers will not mature into market toppers when subjected to alternate 
periods of starvation and excess of food. The farmer who uses 
good sires and fails to provide for the continuous growth of the young 
things loses half the advantage he might gain from good blood and is 
not likely to be a continuous purchaser of good bulls. Likewise the 
breeder of a pure bred herd who uses his cattle mainly as scavengers, 
cannot develop a class of animals which will command a high price on 
the market, because they do not show the finish and quality which 
their breeding requires. These few so-called breeders who persist in 
putting their cattle on the market in bad condition find a class of 
buyers who are not willing to pay for better animals and these 
animals sometimes produce good results under better care, if they 
have not been subjected to too many generations of starvation. Inasmuch 
as these cattle do not come into serious competition with 
high class breeding stock except in periods of depressed markets they 
may do little damage to other breeders, even though they give a false 
impression of the general excellence of the breed. 

It might be well at this juncture to sound a note of warning against 
the opposite tendency of placing bulls on the market in a very high 
condition, having been stall fed and without exercise until they have 
no constitutional vigor or ability to go on and fulfil the expectations 
of the buyers. I know of many instances where good breeders and 
feeders have purchased young bulls and under reasonably good treatment 
have been unable to get either growth or good service from them 
for several months after purchase. Such a forcing of animals is a damage 
not only to the breeder who sells them but to the whole breeding 
fraternity. This abuse reaches its maximum under favorable conditions 
of market, like the present, and is much practiced by all breeders 
of beef cattle. Its bad effect may not always obtain under the most 
skillful handling, but it is the business of the breeder to produce a 
class of animals which can be handled by men of ordinary skill, as 
only this class, when sold to the producers of steers, will bring a renewal 
of orders and uphold the reputation of the breed and breeder. 

tpure bred sire will be more and more valuable as the producer 
f learns to feed for maturity and finish, the difference in Talue 
steer with superior breeding becoming greater with increasing 

The advantage of the pure bred sire is also apparent in the effort 
to produce baby beef or to mature cattle of from eighteen to twentyfour 
months. In all intensive methods of beef production pure bred 
sires are indispensable. </seg>

RESULTS OV MODEL DAIRY BREED Tin. 

The market for pure bulls may be extended to some degree through 
the lowering of prices of the animals sold. Brought down to its ultimate 
analysis we will find the herds of only moderate quality selling 
cheap but good sires to the farming classes for the production of 
steers at a low range of prices, possibly less than 9125, many of the 
females in these herds being sold for beef or to use in the production 
of steers, thus having little or no influence on the trade. 

Ee is no doubt that much benefit to the breed might result in 
f pure bred steers, to illustrate the perfection in beef form to 
the breed has attained. Much damage could surely be averted 
h the castration of inferior males, but it must be admitted that 
rerage quality among pure bred bulls has produced great imlent 
in early maturity, thickness of flesh and feeding quality, 
such animals have been used for a considerable period of time. 

In conclusion it may be said that the factors which seem to me to be 
most favorable to the more extensive use of beef bred sires are: 

1st. The present and prospective high price of beef. 

¦The practice of better methods of feeding and the adjustment 
rm lands to the maintenance of live stock. 

¦The development of strong vigorous cattle under continual good 
and management, and a higher regard for the future usefulness 
imals sold. 

4th. A decrease in the cost of the stock offered for sale, and 

¦ The introduction of animals into new fields by exploiting our 
in Mexico, South America, and the Orient.

DAIRY STATISTICS FOR NEBRASKA. 

PREPARED BY B. C. BAS8ETT, DEPUTY FOOD COMMISSIONER. 

Through the kindness of Mr. L. O. Powers, chief statistician for agriculture, 
I am enabled to give, in advance of the regular publication, 
some statistics in regard to the dairy industry in Nebraska as shown 
by the U. S. census returns for 1900. In the comparisons made as between 
the census returns for 1890 and 1900, attention is invited to a 
few items of more than ordinary interest. The increase in the number 
of milch cows was only 7,499, or 1.5 per cent, while the increase 
in butter production for the same period wag 12,349,978 pounds, or 36 
per cent. At first thought this marked increase might be accounted 
for in the larger use, by dairymen, of improved breeds of dairy cows, 
but I am more inclined to credit the increase largely to the improved 
methods of separating the butter fat from the whole milk; the use of 
separators for the separation of cream instead of the deep can or 
shallow pan systems, which often left from 15 to 50 per cent of the 
butter fat in the skimmed milk. It is true that there has been a 
marked improvement in the use of better bred dairy cows for dairy 
purposes, but a much greater improvement, in proportion, has been 
made in the methods of separating the cream from the milk. 

The decrease in cheese production is not due to the fact that a prime 
quality of cheese can not be made in the state, but rather for the 
reason that milk for cheese making must be delivered at the factory, 
and owing to the small number of milch cows within a radius wherein 
it is practical to deliver milk at a factory, a sufficient quantity of milk 
can not usually be secured to make the manufacture of cheese profit- 

Quite a contrast is shown in the increase in value of dairy products 
in factories, $1,070,893, and the decrease in some of the items of cost 
in manufacturing same. Tn 1890 there were 58 establishments, giving 
employment to 428 persons, to whom $151,126 was paid as wages, an 
average of $353 per year, and the miscellaneous expenses were $49,563. 
Total for the two items, $200,684. In 1900 there were 93 establishments 
(including skimming stations) giving employment to 333 persons, 
to whom $146,522 was paid as wages, an average of $440 per year, 
and the miscellaneous expenses were $38,823. Total for the two items, 
$185,345. 

If we consider as pounds of butter, both the butter and cheese manufactured 
in factories, estimating 10 pounds of cheese as the equivalent 
of 4 pounds of butter, we find that in 1890 the expense for wages and 
miscellaneous items averaged 3.1 cents per pound of butter manufactured, 
while in 1900 the expense for these items averaged 1.5 cents per 
pound, a saving of 1.6 cents on each pound or 50 per cent. 

Thus it will be seen that the establishment of central factories in 
which to manufacture into bntter the cream shipped from skimming 
stations and hand separators, has apparently reduced the cost of manufacturing 
a pound of butter 1.6 cents as compared with a factory in 
each neighborhood. The cost of materials used in the manufacture 
of a pound of factory butter averaged 14.3 cents in 1890, and 15.8 cents 
in 1900, an increase of 1.5 cents per pound, or 10 per cent. As the cost 
of materials in this case is largely the amount paid for cream, and as </seg>

the amount saved in the expense of manufacturing a pound of butter, 

1.0 cents, is almost identical witL the increased cost of materials (paid 

for cream) 1.5 cents per pound, it would seem that the saving in the 

cost of manufacture has inured to the benefit of the patron of the 


The increase in average yield of butter per cow, per year, from 1890 

to 1900 was 21 pounds, or 30 per cant. It should not be inferred that 

our milch cows produce only 90 pounds of butter per cow, per year. 

as not all the milk produced by them is used in the manufacture of 

butter, a large per cent being nsed for other purposes. As before men- 

tioned, much of this increase is doubtless due to the use of separators.

PURE MILK — HOW IT IS PRODI* KD. 

BY HIGH F. M'lXTOSII, EDITOR NEBRASKA FARMER. 

If a city resident were to put the question to a company of fan 
"Where can I go to get the best milk?" every man would douli 
answer, "To the farms, where milk is produced." Nearly every writer 
on the social side of rural life will also enthuse over the fresh air, fresh 
vegetables, fresh fruit and pure milk which are supposed to be abundant 
everywhere on farms. A great deal of sentiment indulged along 
line does no harm, perhaps, though even farm residents would doubtless 
benefit by knowing the facts. Things of this sort are not, how 
susceptible of accurate measurement, their quantity, quality anil general 
distribution being only aseertainable l&gt;y comparison. Even pure 
air, which is as yet not controlled by a trust, is scarce in some li 
in both city and country. And if a correct census of the fruit supply. 
or pure milk 365 days in the year, were made, neither city nor country 
homes would be found to be overly well provided, though all but the 
very poor in this country have their tables daily supplied with - 
sort of milk, even if fruit is still a luxury in most families. The country 
resident has the advantage of knowing who produced his milk — and this 
is something of consequence. It is. at least, a basis for faith in the 
product, and whether or not the milk is up to the sanitary standard 
required by exacting people, the producer, no doubt. pronoun&lt; 
"very good." Quality in milk is relative, however. "Very good 
representing one opinion, may be absolutely nauseating- to another. 
Hence the importance to the individual of cultivating a correct standard 
for dairy products, whether he be a producer of milk on the farm or a 
consumer of milk in the city. And fortunately we are not without a 
guide in this matter, for some there are who have solved the problems 
involved in producing pure, healthful milk. 

A few days ago the editor of Xrbnixka t'nniier spent an afternoon in 
a clean dairy barn and dairy house, inspecting the processes bjf which 
pure milk is produced and kept pure till placed before the consumer in 
original packages — a process so interesting and. though scientifi&lt; 
simple that one is astonished that the method has not been developed 
until within a year or two of this time, and is not adopted by all who 
pretend to some attainment in milk production. 

Pure milk is a product of two things: (1) Healthy cows: (2) wholesome 
men. These two factors have come together on a Nebraska farm 
located near a historic spot, old Fort Calhoun. on the bankR of the 
Missouri river sixteen miles north of Omaha, where the famous I 
and Clarke expedition halted and effected ¦ treaty with the Indians. 
and where afterwards was established the first military post we 
the Missoui river. At this point, in the course of ages, the river 
gradually receded from the western bluffs which mark the serpentine 
course of the prehistoric channel of the river, as it came down from 
the north and wound away to the south and east over what is now 
corn-field and alfalfa and meadow land, fringed with orchards far 
famed for loads of luscious fruit, and a thriving village at the foot of 
the bluff. As the river receded to the eastward, perhaps by one of 
those exhibitions of Titanic force wr in this erratic stream 
in modern time of flood, a great bench of second bottom land was left </seg>

In May, 1901, the history of Locust Lane dairy farm begins, though 
here industrious Hans Schwager, a German by birth and a blacksmith 
by trade, has lived for seventeen years, carefully tilling 1 the soil — improving, 
planting, and building — and bringing up a large fa mi 
industrious, well educated children. *

of northern Germany. Returning from this tour of the leading cities 
of the world, Mr. Sehwager interested his brother in the enterprise of 
marketing, in the city of Omaha, a pure article of milk, prepared in the 
best way known to sanitary science. 

This work was not undertaken without serious misgivings. Omaha 
is a small place when compared with the large cities of the world, and 
its inhabitants are plain, hardworking, economical folk. There is no 
"wealthy class" in this city. More than this, the people of Omaha, in 
recent years, have not paid to exceed five and three-fourth cents per 
quart at retail for the best milk — much of it of very good quality. 
L'nder such conditions, could any considerable amount of milk be Hold 
in Omaha at a price which would justify advanced methods of producing 
The risk seemed considerable, and Mr. Schwager canvassed the 
city thoroughly, consulting with physicians and leading business men 
who were prospective consumers in regard to the demand for pure 
milk. As a result of this work, mainly on the advice of medical men. 
nterprise was undertaken. 

The first step in preparation for this work was the construction of a 
cow barn which can be kept clean. This is no simple task, the word 
"clean," as used, implying sanitarily pure as to the floor, feed troughs, 
water, light and air. The accompanying illustration of the barn 
interior shows the floor as it is being washed; part of the windows of 
the left side and end; the overhead trolley manure carrier, the contents 
of which is dumped into a wagon outside at the end of the barn; 
water trough and feed floor on the right beyond the row of swinging 
stanchions, and beyond which is another row of stanchions facing the 
feed alley — the two rows accommodating thirty head of cows with 
ample room— much more room, in fact, than cows are given as usually 
housed. Modern ventilating flues are constructed in the sides of the 
building. These have their discharge in the cupolas of the barn, which 
are shown in the accompanying illustration of the barn exterior. The 
windows are screened and provided with close fitting blinds on the 
inside, both windows and blinds being adjusted to weight which enable 
them to be closed or opened as readily as those of a house. The stable 
is provided with ample underground sewerage to carry off the water 
in scrubbing it, the waste from watering the cows, etc., etc. 

Eter is conveyed into the barn from a large underground reservoir 
ed at the well and supplied by a windmill pump further up the hill 
near the ample farm residence which is concealed from view by 
rees in the rear and to the left of our illustration. 

Overhead storage is provided for forage and grain, and, outside, on 
the end opposite that shown in the illustration, a 125-ton circular stave 
silo is constructed. 

In every part of the construction of this barn economy and utility 
have been consulted. There is not a "frill" on it, nor any expenditure 
for show purposes. It is neatly painted — to preserve rather than to 
ornament the structure. Within it is clean — scrubbed and dusted as 
thoroughly as many homes and much better ventilated than most 
homes. The cost of barn and silo was about $1,400. Of this sum the 
floor and sewerage represent about $300, and the silo $125. 

The dairy house, shown in the foreground of our illustration, is. like 
the barn, a strictly plain structure, but provided with every factlity for 
handling milk in a rapid and sanitarily clean manner. 

Boregoing concerns us only as the mechanism of milk production, 
tion itself begins with that rare and altogether pleasing thing, 
cow. The foundation animals of Locust Lane Dairy herd are the

grade Holstein-Friesians. Since the new dairy enterprise was started 
cows have been bought from time to time till the stock now number 
forty-five head. These are mainly "just good cows." A pair of pure 
bred Jerseys in the herd are highly appreciated. Some with Red Polled 
blood in evidence and one or two showing Guernsey type are good 
cows. The Messrs. Schwager are broad-minded enough to respect any 
coir whose habits are good and who stands the test of the scales for 
quantity and the Babcock test for quality of milk. The herd, as will be 
seen in the illustration, has all the colors of the rainbow — and "dairy 
type." The requirement of cow performance in Locust Lane Dairy herd 
is plenty of milk testing 4 per cent fat. 

The cows are fed in the barn every day in the year — even when 
pastured in summer they have a lick of bran and salt and alfalfa hay, if 
they want it, in the barn. Care is taken that nothing 1 but strictly s&lt; 
healthful food is available to the cows, and the milk of each animal is 
under constant surveillance for "off flavors." At the present tim&lt; 
cows are fed a grain ration of shorts and gTound corn before milking. 
After milking they get their ration of corn ensilage and either alfalfa 
hay or shredded corn stover. Then they are ready to enjoy their deep 
bed of clean wheat straw for the night. (This corn stover is not 
strictly shredded fodder. It is a similar product got by running shocked 
corn through the threshing machine, which shells the corn and puts 
the stover in good shape for indoor feeding.) 

Beding the cows attention is paid to the condition of each animal. 
w shows a disposition to get fat, at the expense of milk secretion, 
given less corn meal in her feed. Some are stinted, also, in the 
¦e ration, for this product as it exists in Messrs. Schwager's silo 
•ly 15 per cent, by weight, sound corn. It is a strongly carboe 
(fat forming) food. 

Remarkable success has been attained in preserving the ensilage corn 
here, this season. There is absolutely ho waste. The product is ma 
green as newly cut corn fodder to the very edge of the silo, and the 
cows eat it even more ravenously than they do the grain ration. 

Weighing, mixing and compounding "balanced" rations, and feeding 
by rule, are not followed here as closely as one would anticipate in • 
dairy where scientific methods are so closely adhered to in some departments. 
A strongly "proteid" ration is provided, however — mostly 
the product of the farm, alfalfa hay being an indispensable pr 
resource, and the "eye of the master" follows each animal for re- 
The cows are not fat. Each animal is, however, at this time of year 
as soft haired and as full in the paunch as cows in a blue grass pasture 

Preliminary to milking the brush is vigorously used on each coir to 
dust her off and remove every vestige of chaff and straw adhering to 
the udder and flanks from the bedding. Following the brushing a damp 
cloth is used to wipe off the udder and teats of each cow to remove 
every loose particle of dust or dandruff, and if any manure particles 
adhere to the animal anywhere they are washed off. This done, the 
dairy hands repair to the dressing room in the second floor of the barn 
and don their milking suits of spotless white duck, and proceed to milk 
with dry, clean hands. 

The milk, after emptying the teats of the fore-milk, which is w.i 
is drawn into covered, concave bottom, seamless tin milk pails. The 
top of the pail is fitted with a strainer about four inches in diameter, 
and the milker skillfully directs the milk through this strainer into the 
pail. The strainer is an important factor in producing clean milk. 
The maxim here is (as it is everywhere that milk Us handled cleanly) </seg>

            <seg id="p254">

that dirt and the bacteria which breed from dirt must never come in 
contact with the milk. The strainer, as generally used, is the la«t 
resort in taking dirt out of milk. It is effective for removing the 
stable bedding, part of the hair, and the coarse chunks of dry manure 
careless milkers let into the milk pail under ordinary management! 
But at Locust Lane Dairy the strainer is used to keep out of the milk 
every foreign substance, however small. This strainer consists of a 
coarse wire mesh over which is laid a layer of new cheese cloth which 
has been antiseptically treated; next, over this comes a layer of antiseptic 
cotton batting, such as surgeons use in treating wounds; then, 
a top layer of cheese cloth. Tt is through this pad strainer that the

milk [msses from the clean udder of a clean cow into a clean pail. 
The strainer pad is destroyed after once using. The milking pails are 
carried outside of the barn to empty their contents into the large 
covered cans used in carting the milk to the dairy house, which is 
located some fifty yards from the barn. 

In the dairy house, as was said above, the equipment for handling the 
milk is very complete. A steam boiler is used for operating a steam 
turbine centrifugal separator, a steam pump for drawing water from 
a deep well to supply the milk cooler, a rotary turbine bottle washer.

the illustration.

certified milk, in original packages, guaranteed 4 per cent fat, or as 
cream guaranteed 20 per cent fat, or as skim milk wholesaled by the 
can to a manufacturer. It goes through the separator at nearly blood 
heat within a half hour after it is drawn from the cow, mainly to remove 
the indigestible milk serum, and in much less than another half 
hour it has passed over a "cooler" which removes all the animal heat, 
instantly reducing the milk to the temperature of very cold well water, 
and has been put into quart, pint and half-pint glass jars, which are 
stoppered with paraffined pulp corks on which is stamped the date the 
jar was filled, after which the top of the jar is covered with tin foil 
and closed with a seal label. The jars are immediately packed in shipping 
boxes, iced, and every morning and evening at 8:00 started by 
fast express the short ride of sixteen miles to Omaha, where upon 
arrival the product is at once put into store in the refrigerators in the 
tidy salesroom of Locust Lane Dairy, on one of Omaha's leading business 
streets. 

Bi giving this brief review of the handling of the milk in the dairy 
se important details have been omitted. The most essential of 
¦e is the method of cleansing the dairy utensils. The steam boiler 
nishes abundance of hot water for washing, and a brush propelled 
lightning speed by steam is used to scrub the inside of the milk 
bottles and other places inaccessible to the human hand. But, not 
content with such cleansing as can be done by soap and hot water, the 
Erg Schwager put every vessel with which the milk comes in coninto 
a sterilizing chest, where it is baked for half an hour daily in 
iperature of 250 degrees of hot steam. Thus every vestige of bac-1 
life, if any such existed, is obliterated from the dairy. 

Twice a month each cow's performance is subject to the Babcock 
test for butter fat, in connection with the milk scales. Thus a close tab 
is kept on her production and a systematic weeding out and improvement 
of the herd goes on. Good cows are not turned off here, aa is 
sometimes done in milk dairies, once their period of flush milking is 
over. Quite the contrary. A g-ood beef-bred bull is at the head of the 
herd, and the robust calves from these well kept cows are gladly taken 
by neighboring farmers to be grown into beeves. 

The financial success of this enterprise was assured after the first 
week. The salesroom of Locust Lane Dairy was opened just prior to 
the unprecedented hot period of last summer, and the enterprise wm» 
thereby put to the severest possible test in marketing its produce. The 
success met with was such that consumers of milk were convinced that 
with sanitary cleanliness in handling milk the producer can supply a 
sweet, wholesome article under all weather conditions, and the demand 
for Locust Lane Dairy milk and cream have steadily grown from the 
beginning in spite of the fact that the prices charged, 10 cents per 
quart for milk guaranteed 4 per cent fat and 20 cents per pint for 
cream guaranteed 20 per cent fat, are just about double what consumers 
had been accustomed to pay. 

The cost of equipment of Locust Lane Dairy is a considerable item. 
Yet. it will be seen that all the principal elements of cost are for those 
things which are of a permanent character — good for twenty to thirty 
years of use. The elements requiring frequent renewal are utensils and 
fixtures of comparatively small cost. The cost of equipment for the 
proper production of healthful milk is therefore not prohibitive, even 
to a farmer who would make farm dairy butter or sell cream to a 
butter factory. Add to the proper equipment of the dairy an energetic, 
systematic, intelligent management and the farm dairy, as at "Locust 
Lane," becomes a work intensely interesting, yielding satisfaction in

HOME DAIRYING. 

¦ R. B. Richmond. Utica, Neb., contributes the following, to the 
Department of the Ntitraska Farmer: 

Home dairying is something with which I have had considerable experience 
in former years. This was in the state of Illinois. 

When I first commenced dairying on a large scale I was young, and 
like most young people thought after a few trials I knew all about 
batter and cheese making. But after twenty years caring for milk and 
making butter and cheese, I found that butter making for profit was 
not a trade but a profession; I might say an art. I very soon found 
that if I did not learn the art of making prime butter that I would 
never estnblish a reputation of being a good dairy woman and my 
butter would not command the highest market price. As I was working 
for the money there was to be made in making butter I studied the 
art in all its branches. I soon learned that there was something new 
to be learned at nearly every churning. In those days the large, shallow 
tin pans were used; the milk was set in the cellar in summer and 
in the winter in the pantry to keep it from freezing. 

Frozen cream makes very poor butter. 1 have seen people put the 
milk on a stove in cold weather when it was fresh from the cow, and 
heat it quite hot to have the cream come to the surface quickly, saying 
they got more cream from the milk by so doing. Perhaps the milk 
would burn on the bottom of the pan. When the cream from that 
pan of milk was made into nice clean white butter and taken to 
market, the maker would wonder why she did not get the highest 
market price. Is it any wonder to good buttermakers of the present 
day why? I have often heard people say they did not like butter 
coiorcil. I heard one lady say she would not color her butter if it was 
white: she liked the looks of it better; another thing, it tasted bad to 
color it. But when she took her butter to market and her white butter 
brought five cents per pound less than colored butter, the next she 
had ready for market the bad taste of the color had vanished! She 
now colors her butter. 

There is a great deal of butter spoiled in churning. The main object 
with many is to churn the cream into butter as soon as possible. By 
¦ling they spoil what otherwise would have been good butter, 
(ream churned too fast becomes too warm and when it cornea to 
butter will be soft; then the grain is spoiled. A grain, or globule, of 
butter under a magnifying glass resembles the yolk of an egg. If it is 
not broken the butter will be good; but if it is broken it will resemble 
the broken yolk of an egg; it is then oily and no amount of care or 
work can make it prime butter that will command the highest price. 

It would pay every buttermaker to invest thirty-five cents for a milk 
thermometer, and always have the cream the right temperature; then 
ill have no trouble having butter of good grain. 

There are many kinds of churns on the market that should never be 
used. When an agent comes to you with a churn to sell and tells you 
that his churn is the best ever made, that it will bring the butter in 
three minutes, it is a waste of time to talk with him. The old dash 
churn is to be preferred to the "three-minute" churn. The churn that 
gives the best results is either the rotary barrel or box churn. In 
one of these the weight of the cream churns itself. If churned at the 
right temperature the butter will come in the granular form which is 
¦o much desired at the present day. </seg>

Eher mistake that is often made is the salt that is used. Fine 
alt is not pure and should not be used. Ashton or Eureka dairy 
pure and should be used for all dairy purposes. Common barrel 
¦ied and sifted, is better than fine table salt. 

One of the most essential things in dairying is good cows, and those 
well fed. It is a great mistake to think that a cow that gives milk will 
do just as well if she is turned into a dry prairie pasture and given 
drink once a day. as one that has good feed and all the good pare 
water she can drink, with a dessert twice a day of equal parts of corn 
and oats ground together. The feed that makes the best flavored butter, 
in the fall of the year, is green clover and also when the cows are 
turned in the cornstalks after husking. 

There are two grea- natetakaa made in home dairying in Nebraska; 
one is, butter is not sold on its merits as it should be; the other is, 
home dairies do not make butter that competes with creamery butter; 
they should do so if they expect creamery prices. Most farmers have 
the facilities at home for making that kind of butter. They have the 
long pails in tanks of cold water. Some may say there is work in it; 
¦ here is work in it and there is money in it if rightly managed; but 
not at 6 or 10 cents a pound. 

Mrs. A. makes very nice butter, as good or better than creamery; 
Mrs. B. doesn't care; lets the cream stand on the milk until it is moldy 
or until she gets time to skim it. She churns the day she wants to go 
to town, takes it up and washes it, salts it, puts it in a crock or jar, 
takes it to the same store that Mrs. A. does and gets the same price. 
The merchant is the loser unless he can soon sell it to the consumer. 

In Kane county. Illinois, butter is sold now as it was thirty years 
ago, on its merits; the price throughout the county is governed by the 
price of butter sold on the Board of Trade at Elgin. Home dairies 
have the same chance as the creameries. About the 15th of January, 
1900, butter sold there at 23% cents and 24 cents per pound. 

To make "gilt edg-e" butter, set the milk in long tin pails in water at 
temperature of forty degrees if possible; let it stand from twelve to 
wenty-four hours, then skim, place the cream in a tin can to ripen; in 
le winter in a warm place, in the summer in a cool place. Cream 
lould never be churned while sweet, nor left to stand until very &gt; 
it the cream in a churn, at a temperature of 56 or 58 degrees; churn 
owiv until the butter comes in a granular form, about the size of 
grains of wheat, then stop churning, draw off the buttermilk through 
hair strainer, then salt, but mix the salt carefully so as not to break 
he grain: let it stand twelve hours, work and pack in a stone jar to 
ithin about two inches of the top; stretch a white muslin cloth 
he butter, then fill to the top with salt, cover with another cloth; last 
' all tie manila paper over the jar and set in a cold place. You then 
ave butter that will compete with creamery and will keep six months 
nd be good. 

Butter, to keep, should never be washed, should never have Ice used 
about it except to cool the water that milk and cream are set in. 

This is the method of home dairying which I used for many years 
and was successful. 

A NEBRASKA CATTLE FEEDING PLANT. 

O. W. HEKVET, IN NEBRASKA FARMER.

?braska, if not west of the Missouri river, is conducted within the </seg>

be seen tied up in one barn, every day in the week. This is the feeding 
barn of the Willow Springs distillery. The cattle are fed on the refuse 
of the distillery, called "still slops," and a small amount of hay. They 
are tied in the stalls and do not move out of their places from the time 
they enter the stable till they go out to the slaughter house, a period 
ranging in duration from six to nine months. These cattle are range 
steers, stags and bulls. Nine-tenths of them were reared on the plains 
and never saw a barn or feed trough till they were dumped out of the 
cars into the loading chute of the "Willow Springs" distillery, through 
which they were jammed into the long stables, to be tied up to a post 
chain around their necks, there to stand on a wet, water-tight 
r and drink thin slop till they become fat enough for the shambles. 

The cattle are here because a food product is here, and without the 
cattle to eat it it is a total loss. Indeed, for three months of the year, 
June, July and August, this product is simply run into the Missouri river. 
And if it is not a total loss the only part saved is such as is recovered 
in the carcass of the succulent catfish which infests this muddy river. 
And the loss is no inconsiderable item, since it is daily two thousand 
two hundred bushels of sound grain, less only such portion as has been 
converted into "John Barleycorn." Since, therefore, the feed is the 
E'ent of the feeding establishment, let us stop a moment to take stock 
this waste product called "still slop." 

Ea common saying, and one which is literally true, that the art 
lling was invented by Adam. This inventor was not, however, 
her of the race, Adam of Biblical record. He was, indeed, a 
ingly modern sinner who made his discovery in the year 1801 — 
only a century ago. At the present day distilling alcohol from grain 
(and all manufacturers of spirits from grain, whether called whisky, 
gin, alcohol or what not, are but degrees of the distilling of alcohol) is 
a highly developed chemical process. The object in every case when 
distilling from grain is resorted to is to convert the starch in the grain 
into alcohol; the alcohol to be recovered by the distilling process. This 
object is effected by converting the starchy matter of the grain first 
into sugar (glucose). This is effected by taking advantage of another 
constituent of the grain, the gluten — one of the most valuable food 
elements of the grain. It has been ascertained that by the "malting" 
or sprouting process barley develops a digestive ferment called "diastase." 
This ingredient, acting in connection with the gluten, breaks 
up the starch, converting it into the desired sugar. The sugar is 
acted on again by an active ferment which, as the chemists say, "splits 
it up" into alcohol and carbonic anhydride (this gas when mixed with 
air is the well known deadly "choke gas" sometimes encountered in 
wells). The ferment used for this last process is common yeast. In 
the process of distilling 112 pounds of corn produces 40 pounds of 
"spirit," 45 per cent (a little less than half) of which is alcohol. The 
other common grains vary slightly from this standard in their yield of 

It will be observed that in the distilling process but one element 
of the grain is converted and removed, viz., the starch. This is a carbonaceous 
food factor, in corn representing approximately two-thirds, 
by weight, of the grain. The remaining nutrients, after extracting 
the starch in the form of alcohol, are the "protein" and "fat," representing 
approximately one-eighth the weight of the grain. It is this 
one-eighth the cattle feeding at the Willow Springs distillery is 
designed to save. 

In the process of operating the Willow Springs distillery the grains, </seg>

A NEBRASKA CATTLE FEEDING PLANT. 

corn, rye and malted barley, are mixed in proper proportions and 
ground. The meal is then mixed with water on the basis of forty 
gallons to one bushel of grain. This thin gruel is then thoroughly 
cooked by steam in a copper tank, when it becomes "mash" and is 
cooled and turned into a wooden tank of 36,000 gallons capacity. To 
this tank of mash the yeast in proper proportion is added, and in a 
few hours active ferment exists throughout the mass. The first effect 
of this ferment is to develop the carbonic gas, which passes off into 
the air. In about four days the fermentation will cease, the gas having 
been driven out, and the tank is ready for distilling to separate the 
alcohol from the mash. The "spirit" is driven off by gently heating 
the mash; and when the alcohol is all out the residue, a thin, steaming, 
ill-smelling slop, is turned out into the cooling tanks to be fed to 
the cattle. On the railway trains entering Omaha from the east, thousands 
of persons daily pass that row of eight great elevated tanks of 
"still slop" near the Nebraska end of the splendid railroad bridge 
which forms the connecting link between Iowa and Nebraska. A 
multitude of these travelers have curiously inquired of themselves or 
a neighbor, "What is that dirty stuff for?" And but very few Omaha 
citizens could answer the inquiry correctly, thus: "That, sir, is a 
cooked breakfast for 2,034 hungry western cattle!" 

The cattle are tied with short chains to a ring which slides on an 
upright pole or rod. Two rows face each other. No stalls exist. The 
floors and manure gutters are water tight. No bedding is used. The 
excrement is scraped out twice daily, and is washed into the river near 
by. The animals can lie down, but on floors that are always wet; 
and while they seem sociable with each other and lose much of their 
fear of man, so that a species of contentment exists, they are frequently 
footsore and ill at ease. From close housing in an excessively 
moist atmosphere their coats are thin and quite sleek. Deaths occur 
Eong them — in some seasons quite too frequently, and, always, it i» 
3, with a peculiar disease of the spleen or "melt." 

ETie feeding arrangement consists of a raised alley about four feet 
le on either side of which is a sunken trough one foot wide and 
tut the same in depth. These feed alleys and troughs extend the 
gth of the stable. At feeding time the slop In one of the great 
tanks is stirred with a long-handled rake to bring it to a uniform consistency, 
and when all is ready a flood-gate in the tank is lifted and 
the slop flows in and fills the troughs before the cattle. Hay is fed 
in the alley, the allowance per steer being about six pounds per head 
daily. The hay is eaten up very clean, and the allowance has to be 
limited, the excess of water in the slop giving the stock a craving for 
dry food. 

It is found in practice that three- and four-year-old steers consume 
but a little less than the residue of one bushel of grain daily in distillery 
feeding. In actual practice, at the Willow Springs distillery, 
where 2,300 bushels of grain is now ground daily except Sunday (even 
a distillery is made to respect the Sabbath day by the United States 
government, and is closed on that day) the 2,034 cattle take it all, 
the excess gained each day being required for the Sunday feed. 

The physical character of this feed seems to be a serious problem in 
getting the best results from it. It will be observed that in making the 
"mash" mentioned above forty gallons of water is used to each bushel 
of grain. In distilling the spirits only four gallons of this water is 
recovered. This leaves thirty-six gallons of water to be digested by 
the cattle for each bushel of grain eaten. In dry lot feeding, under </seg>

            <seg id="p260">
352 


Bil conditions, a steer will consume eight to twelve gall' 
daily. Thus it is seen the slop fed cattle are required to digest 
cess of eighteen to twenty-two gallons of water daily. 

LThe ration is also a badly "balanced" food. The carbonaceoi. 
ent being largely removed, the excess of protein puts a fattening 
steer at a very great disadvantage, and it would seem that some 
system should be devised cheaply to get rid of excess of water in the 
ood and to supply a proper amount of the carbonaceous element, 
["he ration appears to have about one part protein to 3.2 parts carxmaceous. 
while a proper fattening ration should be about 1 to 6.5. 
n spite of this handicap in the quality and mechanical condition of 
he feed, and the further disadvantage of close housing, these slop fed 
cattle are expected to gain 250 to 450 pounds in a feed period averaging 
eight months. 

SI feed privilege at Willow Springs distillery is contracted to E. 
old. of Montana, and Hysham &amp; McPherson. of South Omaha, 
price is based on the number of bushels at grain ground for disg, 
the residue being valued at four cents on the bushel. The 
ng operations are in charge of Mr. John Centerfield. an una&gt;entlcnian 
who has met with rather unusual success in maintaining 
ealth of his stock and making gains under what seem to be hard 
tions. 

The "tops" of the season's feeding have been going forward to the 
market since the latter part of March, and by June 1st the great barns 
of the Willow Springs distillery will be empty. The scene of operations 
will then shift to central Montana where another herd will be collected 
for feeding next winter. 

THE CATTLE POPULATION OF NEBRASKA AND ITS 

GROWTH FOR FORTY YEARS. 

G. W. HERVEV, IN NEBRASKA FARMER. 

The rapid advancement of the cattle industry in Nebraska is one of 
the encouraging features in agricultural improvement, and may !&gt;&lt;• 
used in this connection to illustrate the progress made in farm and 
ranch development in the state. 

A look back over the cattle population of Nebraska for the past forty 
years presents some interesting facts in statistical history that .ire 
worth reviewing at this period in census study, when all the cattle producing 
world is interested in what our country is doing, and wliat 
our outlook for the future may be. 

In 1860 the cattle population of Nebraska was :i~,192 head, classified 

as follows: 12,594 working oxen, 6.995 milch cows and 17,60s other 

t there were 8,931 working oxen. 28.940 milch cows and 45.057 
le; an increase of 42,731 cattle in the ten year period from 
K&gt;, or a total of 79.928, an average annual increase of 11*4 
It will be observed that a great change took place from l mu&gt; 
the number of working oxen kept. The decrease in the ten 
esenting 112 1-3 per cent, while the increase of milch cows </seg>

353 

GROWTH OJ 1 CATTLE POPULATION OF NCBRA8KA. 

represented 314 per cent and the increase in other cattle 156 per cent. 
The large population of working oxen in 1860 was due to the fact that 
the transportation facilities during that period of the state's history 
were meager, freight and passenger business being operated mainly 
by ox power. The government wagon trains and the emigrant's moring 
wagon being drawn exclusively by ox teams. 

In 1880, the end of the next ten-year period, there was quite an 
increase in working cattle, due no doubt to the large immigration into 
the state at that time, where the ox team and covered wagon system 
of transportation was employed as a cheap means of travel for the 
homeseeker. The cattle population of the state at this date shows an 
•¦gate of 758,550 head; working oxen, 7,234, milch cows 16 
other cattle 590,129; an increase of 457 per cent in milch cows during 
census period, between 1870 and 1880, and 987 per cent increase of 
other cattle, or an average annual increase in this class of 98.7 per 
cent for the ten years. 

In 1890, covering the census period from 1880 to 1890, there wa« 
reported 2,142,597 cattle; oxen 5,768, milch cows 505,045 and other 
cattle 1,631,784, showing an increase in this period of 213 1-3 per cent 
on milch cows and 176 3-5 per cent on other cattle. 

The cattle population of Nebraska according to the censas report 
of June 1st, 1900, shows as follows: Calves under one year, 754,500; 
steers one year and under two, 401,158; steers two years and under 
three, 317,360; steers three years and over, 119,590; heifers one year and 
under two, 345,275; dairy cows two years and over 512,544; other cows 
years and over, 674,025; bulls one year and over 51,691. Making a 
total of farm and ranch cattle in the state of 3,176,143. There is additional 
to these, cattle in barns and inclosures of all classes and ages, 
62,850 head, making a total of cattle in the state of 3,238,993. These 
figures show an increase of 1,096,396 over the return of 1890, making 
a gain of more than 51 per cent for ten years. The average annual 
increase in the cattle population of Nebraska for the forty years preceding 
1900 was 30 per cent. This is a record showing great development 
in this branch of farm industry. 

Eill be observed that there has been a very important and valuable 
rement in the classification of cattle for the census reporta of 
The ages and kinds of cattle, whether steers or heifers, cowi or 
is a feature that makes it possible for a reasonably accurate 
te to be had of the available cattle supply for all purposes. 

Ian annual live stock census, which should be provided, the unguesswork 
on the available beef cattle supply of the country 
be in a measure corrected and the basis of statistical informai 
this line of produce, would be a key to the situation and the 
tin element in speculation which has puzzled the trade for the 
'teen to twenty years would be removed. 

In the census report of 1900 there were listed 754,500 calves under 
one year old. One-half of these, or 377,250. may be credited as steers 
and are now two years old. In the yearling steer class there were 
401,158 head;, these, owing to the scarcity of feed last fall, have been 
carried over winter and are mainly in the hands of the original owners, 
and will be on the market this year as three-year-old grass-fat steers. 
There were on June 1st, 1900, steers of all ages, including calves, 
1.215.358; of these, 40 per cent were two years old and over. Under 
ordinary conditions this "40 per cent" would long since have passed 
into the feed yards, thence in regular course to the slaughtering 
markets to be followed by the younger ages as in the natural course

of growth they are moved forward. Thus it may be observed that a 
pretty accurate estimate of the beef cattle and steer supply of the 
try may be had, under the annual live stock census system. 

I: are many thousands more cattle now in Nebraska than when 
isus was taken in 1900. The influence of the drouth last sumused 
tens of thousands of cattle to be brought into Nebraska 
.ss and feed. Train-loads of these cattle were distributed over 
rn and western Nebraska, where the hay and pasture were far 
ss of the wants of the home herds. This influx of cattle, while 
esents a temporary class, will mostly be marketed from the 
ka ranges. 

The cattle population of the state will not increase as rapidly in 
the next ten years as it has in the past ten. The unsettled condition 
in the control of range rights and privileges on the public domain will 
• heck the progress of herd improvement until some fixed system is 
adopted for this land whereby rights are recognized. If the open 
range system is forced by government order, there will follow a very 
decided decrease in the cattle population of the state. With this will 
also come a perceptible falling off in quality, owing to the disposition 
among herd owners to take no chances in turning high priced bulls on 
the open range. 

TREE PLANTING ON RURAL SCHOOL GROUNDS.* 

BT TX. L. HALL, BUREAU OF FOBK8TBT, V. 8. DEPARTMENT OF AORICOLTUBS. 

INTRODUCTION. 

irreat number of schoolhouses in the United States lack the surroundings 
that make for comfort and contentment. City school grounds 
are often so small that planting is out of the question, though, where 
space permits, it is not uncommon to find them carefully laid out, with 
a good arrangement of grass plots, flower beds, and shade trees. In 
- and villages, also, may be pointed out many examples showing 
great care and attention. In the country, however, an improved school 
ground is rarely found. In hilly, forest regions they are often denuded 
of soil and full of stones and stumps, and on the prairie many are wellnitrh 
as bare, bleak, and inhospitable as when they formed a part of the 
led plain. 

L— A town schoolhouse in a prosperous agricultural region, entirely unprotected 

This lack of improvement is not due to causes evident at first sight. 
not on account of poverty, for it is almost as common in wealthy 
as in less prosperous communities. (Figs. 1, 2, and 3.) It is not due to </seg>

355 

lack of appreciation of the elements of beauty, for where homes are 
surrounded with trees, grass, and flowers the school ground is likely 
to be entirely neglected. Neither is it due to indifference in educa- 
Konal affairs, for none are more cordial in their support of school sys'ms 
and institutions of learning than the American people. The cause 
seems to lie rathe_r in the failure to see the importance of comfort 
and beauty in education and to realize the interest of the American 
youth in the natural world around him. Some err so far as to mistrust 
the willingness of the boyB and girls to allow trees and shrubs 
to grow unmolested on the school ground. This is a flagrant misinterpretation 
of the spirit of childhood. With a better understanding 
of youthful nature, one sees an easily awakened regard for things beautiful 
and a disposition to respect and help all well-directed activities 
for the improvement of school life. 

REASONS FOB SCHOOL-GHOUND PLANTING. 

Protection.— The strongest reason for school-ground planting is for 
the comfort of the teacher and pupils who occupy the building from 
seven to nine months each year. A schoolhouse so situated as wholly 

Fio. 2.— Unprotected sod schoolhouse ou the Oreat Plains. 

to lack protection from inclement weather often subjects its occupants 
to distressing conditions. During winter gales there is an increasing 
demand for fuel, which, though supplied, often does not suffice to keep 
the building warm. The teacher is then put to test contriving methods 
by which no pupil shall endure more than his share of cold, and by 
which to maintain the usual good order during study hours and provide 
for indoor recreation at the rest periods. With the temperature </seg>

356 

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

hovering around the zero point during a howling blizzard, one has but 
to enter a country schoolroom to appreciate its discomforts and see 
its need of protection. 

The winds of spring are almost as trying as those of winter, and in 
summer the sun beats down with unchecked violence. Thus each season 
is accompanied by ill effects for those who must attend school where 
the grounds are exposed. The question naturally arises: May not these 
conditions be remedied? To this the answer certainly should be that 
they may. They have been remedied in some instances, and can be in 
others. It is not too much to say that in nine cases out of ten exposed 
school grounds can be rendered comfortable by trees planted in windbreaks. 


Educational Value of Trees. — But comfort is not the only reason for 
planting about the schoolhouse. The trees have also an educational 
value. Indeed, bare grounds may be regarded as an opportunity. Children 
interested in the work of selecting, planting, and growing trees 
and shrubs about the school can gain in the work no little knowledge 
of right principles and methods. Many people think that to plant a 
tree all that needs to be done is to dig up a sapling, or buy it, and set 
it in a hole. This is a great mistake, responsible for many unnecessary 
failures. Some knowledge of tree culture is a thing sure to prove 
useful to a large proportion of school children.

357 


Forestry is beginning to attract attention as a possible subject of 
school instruction. So far the interest in it is mainly as a branch of 
nature study, but its growing economic importance may eventually 
result in its extensive introduction into courses of study. Technical 
forestry can not be taught in the schools as part of a general education, 
and it ought not to be supposed that tree planting on school 
grounds looks in that direction. Nevertheless a plantation of forest 
or a wood lot, in connection with a school, would give an excellent 
opportunity for study of forest growth and management, and in 
many places it is perfectly feasible. (Fig. 4.) 

Hut there is another side to the educational value of tree plair 
which is of first importance. It is money well spent to make the 
sohoolhouse and everything about it attractive and beautiful. Here is 
one of the centers of the life of the community, the one in which is 
gathered its most impressionable element. The school is supported 
at public expense in order to make good American citizens. It aims 
at securing the highest possible development of mind and charu 
element of order, neatness, and beauty, every broadening influevery 
appeal to the finer nature of the child means better 
and women and a more thrifty, prosperous, and attractive community. 
Americans are justly proud of their school system, and should be willing 
ipport the schools not only with money, but with time and labor. 

AKIiOK DAY AND SCHOOL-GROUND PLANTING. 

The neglected condition of the school ground has not remained without 
notice or without some effort toward improvement. The sentiment 
in favor of school-ground comfort and adornment has gradually 
increased for the last thirty years, and has been greatly aided by the 
'lishment of an annual Arbor Day for tree planting. Arbor Day 
was proposed by Hon. J. Sterling Morton, ex-Secretary of Agriculture, 
was first observed in Nebraska, where it was officially recognized 
in 1872. It was first associated with school-ground planting in Cincinnati, 
in 18S2, iu connection with a meeting of the American Forestry 
Association. Since then it has been best known by its observance in 
the schools. All (Tie states have followed the example of Nebraska in 
establishing' Arbor Day, and the movement has now spread into many 
foreign countries. Great Britain, France, Spain, Japan, and New Zealand 
all celebrate their Arbor Days. 

Ed of Celebrating Arbor Day. — The governor of each state annuoints 
Arbor Day at the proper season for planting. This day 
rated in the schools by public exercises appropriate to tree 
. with essays, songs, and recitations by the pupils, and adliv 
visitors. In connection with the exercise there is ordinarily 
less tree planting. Great care is taken to make the planting 
ceremonies impressive by letting the children take part, and by planting 
trees commemorative of noted persons or events. Much more attention 
is given to these matters than to having the trees in the best 
condition and to planting them just right. 

P might have been expected, the results upon the school grounds 
not been marked. Too often the work has been impulsive and 
nterest transient. Trees planted with ceremonious dignity in 
have died of neglect before September, and those that survived 
liein left to fight unaided their battles for existence. So little 
attention has been paid to the choice of trees and to the methods of 
Bag that those entirely unfit for the situation have often been 
and have been planted in places where they could not receive 
tion while young, or serve any useful purpose when grown. </seg>

Arbor Day has often come on dry, windy days, or clear out of season 
for planting. Furthermore, the planting has been on too small a scale 
to be of great benefit. Where an acre of trees in a solid block is needed, 
only half a dozen specimens have been planted. After all that has been 
done, the school grounds are still largely unimproved.

trees as useful, living things, and about forests as great sources of 
national wealth to be protected and perpetually maintained. The 
smallness of the results has itself drawn attention to the inadeo 
of past methods. It is due in part to lessons learned in Arbor Day 
planting that we are now ready to begin work with a better understanding 
of what is to be done. 

Necessity for Better Methods. — The need of the school grounds iplantations 
of hardy trees, cared for by such methods as will keep them 
constantly thrifty. The trees should be selected and planted in the 
most careful manner. They should be properly placed, and in suffi 
number. To plant in this way requires a great deal of attentii 
details. It may be the work of several days. The perishable ir 
of trees also makes it extremely important to plant them when the 
weather conditions are just right. Dry, windy weather may cause several 
days' delay in the planting. It is therefore impracticable to depend 
wholly on a specified day for the work. Let the trees be planted at 
the right time; then, if public exercises are planned, they may be held 
on an appointed day after the planting is completed. 

B difficulties at present encountered may be overcome by placing 
ection of the planting in the hands of some person who underfully 
its purpose. The pupils should assist in the work because 
r their own school ground, but on account of their lack of expethey 
should work under competent supervision. 

PRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR PLANTING. 

A movement to improve the school ground is likely to encounter 
many obstacles. The first, and perhaps the most serious, is public indifference. 
Then there are the difficulties of getting started on the 
right planting plan, of finding methods to carry it out, and of h:i 
the planted trees properly cared for during both the school year and 
the vacation period. These are formidable obstacles, as many persons 
experienced in school-ground planting will testify; yet they have been 
overcome in a large number of cases, and will continue to be overcome, 
for every school ground successfully planted will not only induce other 
districts to undertake the work, but will reveal the methods by which 
it may be accomplished. 

Eof permanent value the planting must be a matter of concern 
whole district. The teacher and the school can not accomplish 
¦k unaided by the parents, neither can the parents accomplish 
&gt;ut the aid of the teacher and the school. Only when all work 
&gt;n can the best results be obtained. Unfortunately there are 
les persons In the district who have no interest in improven 
and it may even happen that they control the school board, while those 
who have an intelligent interest in the matter may be few in number, 
»nd even the teacher may be too deficient in knowledge of planting to 
give valuable assistance; but such a situation as this is not hopeless If 
the few persons who desire to make improvements know how to I 
things about. 

Eie Planting Flan. — The first step is to prepare a plan. This should 
i detailed outline of the planting based on a complete analysis of 
situation. Tt should embody a map of the grounds, with the sehool?e. 
outbuildings, and place for planting the trees accurately located. 
Tf the plan is presented at a meeting in the schoolhouse. a blackboard 
drawing should be made showing the school ground and exactly what 
planting is proposed. Tn this way its advantages can be more clearly 
pointed out, and its defects, if there be any, will also be pointed out 
and remedied. </seg>

It is scarcely to be expected that a plan will be made which will suit 
all; so here, as in other matters that concern communities, the majority 
should rule. It is always to be hoped that the school board, the 
ler, and those most active in the improvement of the community 
will be in perfect accord. If points of difference arise and are not «ettlcil 
after candid discussion, they should be referred to disinterpersons 
or dropped out of the plan entirely. 

A District Policy.— While undue haste in adopting a plan should be 
illy ayoidfd. it should Ik 1 remembered that many good MRiix-ni* 
fail by not beintf properly prosecuted. If the district adopt 
policy of establishing anil permanently maintaining a plantation of 
and shrubs on the school ground for ornament, protection, and 
improvement, a great advance will have been made; but until this has 
done there is no guaranty of lasting results. It is easy to arouse 
tlic tree-planting spirit in the school, but unless this interest has the 
support of the district it is likely to wane and languish. The teacher 
can not take the responsibility, for his tenure of office is liable to be 
Both teacher and school must be among the chief agencies in 
carrying out the work, but only according to the general plan, judicidirected 
by the district authorities. The appropriate celebration 
of Arbor Day as a part of the plan will aid greatly in the promotion of 
education and sentiment in tree planting. 

I soon as a policy of planting is adopted, some experienced person 
1 be appointed to superintend the preparation of the ground, the 
ring of the trees, the planting, and the subsequent cultivation. 
services must usually be paid for, but they are well worth the 

WHAT PLANTING TO DO. 

There should be both purpose and method in school-ground planting. 
The trees must be so arranged as best to serve both for protection and 
for ornament. At the same time, to grow well they must be adapted 
to the soil. On a small ground but little planting is possible; a group 
of trees or shrubs placed where they will look well or hide some unsightly 
feature of the schoolhouse or ground is sufficient. But in the 
country there is usually an acre or two of grounds. The schoolhouse 
is nearly always in the middle, and the playgrounds are usually about 
halfway between the building and the outer boundary. This arr; 
ment leaves open the outer portions of the ground, where the greater 
part of the planting is needed. 

F.v so planting, the schoolhouse will be protected on all sides from 
the wind, while in summer shade will be provided near all portions 
of the open playground; at the same time inclosing the ground with 
a border of trees will give a pleasing ornamental effect. Instead of 
being continuous around the ground, the border should be broken in 
places to preserve attractive views of the exterior landscape. 

K general directions here given may be helpful in affording sugis, 
but without modification will seldom be fully adapted to parcases. 
The general condition and size of the grounds, direc-1 
prevailing winds, slope, and surroundings should collectively 
ine the character of the planting. 

A Bear Belt. — In many cases the first necessity is to plant a belt of 
across the rear of the lot. If the ground is large, this may be 
several rods wide and cover an acre or more. Possible it may be 
extended around the outbuildings so as to hide them from view. Solid 
planting should be the rule. But it often happens that the rear views 
from a schoolhouse are quite as attractive as those toward the front. 
In that case the planting must be planned so as to preserve them, </seg>

            <seg id="p269">
while hiding the unattractive features and giving: the necessary protection 
to the ground and building. Figure 5 shows a good belt of 
for the rear of a school ground, where solid planting is desirable. 

Other Planting. —After the rear belt, the side planting is of the most 
importance. Here again the trees should be in belts. To allow room 
for a playground it may be necessary to make the side belts narrower 
than that in the rear. Openings in them for walks or views of the 
exterior landscape may also be desirable, but these need not affect the 
general plan. 

A suitable belt for the rear of m school ground. 

A formal arrangement with the trees in straight rows along the 
siiles of the lot will in many instances be appropriate and satisfat ¦¦ 
It gives opportunity for cultivation, and is both simple and attractive. 
On larpe grounds a better effect will often be produced by spacing 
the trees irregularly. Some attention will be required to leave p«»-sages 
open for cultivation without the trees appearing to stand in rows. 
The appearance of the entire ground will be improved by varying the 
width of the belts so that they will project into the interior open space 
in some places, and in others retreat almost to the boundary of the 
ground. 

The front ground in most cases should not be solidly planted. If 
it is necessary to hide objectionable buildings and other objects on the 
front and sides or to prevent the trespassing of stock, either a hedge 
or an irregular belt of shrubbery may be made to serve the purpose. 
Two or three groups may be introduced where they will not interfere </seg>

TME PLANTING ON RURAL SCHOOL GROUNDS. 

363 

Hardy Trees. — The first rule to lay down is to plant only the kinds 
that are known to be hardy. A school-ground plantation is no place 
for experiment. Naturally the trees will have to endure greater hardships 
than those of a private plantation; they will be likely to have 
less cultivation and be subject to more abuse. No matter how strict 
the rules, the soil about them will be more or less trampled, and twigs 
will sometimes be broken from their tops. Any tree that can not 
endure moderate abuse of this kind should not be given a place on the 
school-ground. 

On account of difference in the soil, a tree that thrives in one place 
in a locality may not thrive in another place. Sandy soils and clay 
soils are often found near together, and trees that grow thriftily in 
sandy soil may have a hard struggle to exist when planted in clay. 
For this reason both the soil and the subsoil of the school ground 
should be carefully examined, and a list should be made of trees in the 
neighborhood that are thriving on soils of the same character, and no 
other species should be used. Much better success may be expected 
with a soil and subsoil of a porous character than with one that is 
tenacious and impenetrable. Yet a careful study will show numerous 
ies adapted to each kind of soil. 

fi Easily Obtained. — Elms, oaks, and maples are to be had almost 
¦re. and are easily transplanted. They are as beautiful as any 
o be found, and are in every way well adapted for the school 
. They grow on a great variety of soils, and can be easily 
from seed if young trees are not available. Every region will 
other valuable sorts, such as beeches, chestnuts, walnuts, ashes, 
or spruces. From these and such other desirable kinds as the 
r affords the selection should be made. 

Short and Long-Lived Trees. — The school ground being permanent and 
the need of trees continuous, for the most part long-lived trees should 
be used. But where the present need of trees is great, there is another 
side to the question. A short-lived tree grows quickly, coming into 
early usefulness, and serves its purpose for from twenty-five to fifty 
years. A long-lived tree usually grows more slowly, but serves it« 
purposes for a century or more. In many cases it is advisable to use 
ihe two kinds in such a way that the long-lived trees will become 
useful about the time the short-lived trees reach maturity. The latter 
can then be removed, leaving the ground to the long-lived trees. In 
all cases an ultimate stand of such trees as elms, oaks, walnuts, or 
chestnuts should be the aim. 

A Variety of Species. — It may seem that the number of kinds which 
can be used for the school-ground planting is small, but this is not the 
case. In almost all sections of the country a long list of species fully 
adapted to the purpose can be made out. In selecting among these the 
aim should be to give the plantation as much variety as possible, 
among other purposes it is to serve that of instruction. 

OBTAINING THE TREES. 

Rest Seedlings. — Tn msny places trees can be obtained from the 
boring forest, from the banks of streams, from plantations, or 
from open fields. If they have had normal conditions of growth 
re taken at the right time, they are almost as valuable for plant.s 
nursery-grown seedlings. Pine, spruce, and cedar are to be 
collected in unlimited numbers in many forests, and frequently, ash, 
maple, and elm are almost as abundant. They may be gathered either 
in the fall or spring, but unless they are very carefully heeled in and 
protected over winter the better time is early spring. In collecting

than those grown in the shade. The collector should never pull the 
trees from the gTOund, but should dig them carefully with a spade, 
preserving as much of the root as possible. As each tree is dug it 
should be placed in a barrel containing water until all are collected,

seeds. (See Fig. 7.) If grown from seed, the 
trees will usually need to remain in the nursery 
only one or two years. Just before time 
for planting they should be taken up and 
heeled in so that they will be in readiness 
when wanted. 

Trees From a Nursery. — The most common 
method of obtaining forest trees in regions 
remote from the natural woodland is to purchase 
them from a nursery. Nearly all nurseries 
grow trees for ornamental planting, and 
a number in the prairie states offer stock for 
forest planting. Where large quantities are 
handled, the trees are usually sold as seedlings 
when one or two years old, and are 
quoted by the hundred or thousand, the 
price for ordinary kinds ranging from $2 to 
$7 per thousand. Ornamental trees are sold 
at the age of from three to five years, after 
BX been transplanted once or more. They 
)ld by the single tree, or in small quanat 
prices ranging from 10 to 25 cents 

As a rule there is little to be gained by 
planting large trees. If only a few are to 
be planted and the best of care can be given 
them, trees 8 or 10 feet high, or even larger, 
may be used, and are much less likely to be 
injured after planting; but if a number are 
required, smaller trees are better. Besides 
costing much less, they are not so bulky, 
nnd are, therefore, less expensive to ship, 
ifficult to plant, and are always transplanted 
with greater success than larger 
ones. Fip. S shows a good size. This tree is

nursery in the same region, and, if possible, one which can ship over 
a single line of railroad. Every precaution should be taken to prevent 
delays in shipment and transit, and the receiver should be ready to 
care for the stock when it arrives. 

As soon as the trees are received, they should be unpacked and 
prepared for heeling in by placing the roots in a thin mixture made 
l&gt;.v stirring together earth and water. They should remain in this 
while a trench is being dug, deep enough to bury the roots and about 
half of the tops. It should extend east and west, with its south bank 
sloping at an angle of about 30° with the surface of the ground. In 
this is placed a layer of trees, with their tops leaning south and their 
roots and trunks covered and well packed with fresh fine earth taken 
out on the north side of the trench. In the trench thus formed on 
the north side of the first layer is placed a second layer, with the tops 
leaned over on the first and covered in the same way. This operation 
is continued until all the trees have been heeled in. They should be left 
in this condition until the time of planting. </seg>

HOW TO PLANT THE TREES. 

Preparation of the Soil. — Thorough preparation of the soil should 
precede the planting. Where blocks or belts are to be formed, the 
ground should be plowed and prepared as for a garden crop. Clay 
soils are best plowed the previous fall, in order that the ground may 
weather over the winter. On such soil subsoiling is beneficial, and 
should precede the planting by at least one season. Just before planting 
time the ground should be pulverized with a roller or harrow. If the 
planting is to be done in rows, the ground should be marked off lengthwise 
and crosswise and the trees set at the intersections. It is sometimes 
desirable to mark off the ground only one way and run furrows 
¦ ther. In arid regions the furrows may be deepened into trenches, 
bo that rain water which falls on the surrounding ground may be 
drained to the tree. On the other hand, in regions having a copious 
rainfall it will frequently be necessary to plant the trees on a raised 
portion or mound of earth in order to keep the soil dry enough for 
them to thrive. The holes should be dug large enough to contain all 
the roots fully spread out, and deep enough to allow the tree to stand 
about three inches lower than it grew as a seedling. 

Time and Manner of Planting.— South of the thirty-seventh parallel, 
fall planting is safe and often advantageous. North of this, spring 
planting should be the rule, as fall-planted trees can scarcely develop 
sufficient roots to sustain themselves during the winter. The most 
successful nurserymen practice early planting for deciduous trees, 
beginning operations as soon as the ground ceases freezing. Evergreens 
are not planted until later; some even wait until the young 
growth is starting. If possible, planting should be done on a cool, 
cloudy day. Unless the day is very moist, the trees should be carried 
to the planting site in a barrel half filled with water, or a thin mixture 
of earth and water, and lifted out only as they are wanted. Even a 
minute's exposure to dry air will injure the delicate roots — the feeders 

The roots should be extended in their natural positions and carefully 
packed in fine loam soil. It is a good practice to work the soil about 
each root separately and pack it solid with the foot. As the hole is 
filled, the earth should be compacted abare the roots and around the 
stem, in order to hold the tree firmly in place. The last two inches of 
soil should be very fine, and should lie perfectly loose. It will serve 
as a mulch to retain the moisture. 

Trees should be planted neither in very wet nor in very dry soil. If 
the soil is wet, it is better to wait until it is drier. On the other hand, 
if good cultivation has been maintained the year previous to planting 
the soil is not likely to be so dry that trees will not start. Besides 
insuring a supply of moisture, such cultivation puts the ground in 
good physical condition for planting. 

With this treatment watering will scarcely ever be necessary. If 
it is, the holes may be dug a few days beforehand and filled with 
water. They should be refilled as the water soaks away until the soil 
is fully moistened. A thorough irrigation, when that is possible, is 
still better. As soon as the soil becomes somewhat dry the trees 
should be planted. While it is a common custom to water at the time 
of planting, those who do no watering are usually the most successful. 
Even in the semiarid regions some successful growers apply no water, 
but keep up an excellent system of cultivation, thereby retaining the 
soil moisture. 

The spacing of the trees is not so important in school-ground plant- </seg>

Ed not stand so near together as to produce long, slender poles; 
le contrary, short, thick trunks are desirable, to support large 
and withstand heavy winds. From eight to twelve feet apart

WHY TREES DIE IN TRANSPLANTING. 

To many persons it is a mystery why trees die after being transplanted. 
They do not die without cause, however, and when one begins 
to wither something is wrong. Oftentimes the result is not to 
be noticed until weeks after the injury; in other cases it is apparent 
in a few days. After the injury has been done it can be overcome 
only by the subsequent growth of the tree. All the assistance that 
can be given is to make the surroundings of the tree favorable for 
growth. The following are some of the causes of death among transplanted 
trees: 

Loss of Boots. — The loss of the principal part of its root system when 
the tree is being taken up is a great shock to its vitality, and frequently 
causes its death. A very large part of the root must be cut 
off, for usually the space surrounding the tree is filled with fibrous 
rootlets, myriads of which can scarcely be detected with the naked 
eye. Almost all of these are lost, as well as many of the larger roots. 
Mr. D. C. Burson, of Topeka, Kan., last year dug up and measured as 
much as he could of the root system of a vigorous Hardy Catalpa 
seedling that had grown from May till November. This six-months-old 
seedling showed over 250 feet of root growth. By the methods in common 
use only a fifth, or perhaps as little as a tenth, of the root is 
taken up with the tree in transplanting. Such loss throws the root 
out of balance with the top. If the top is not shortened, or in some 
way protected, the leaves may evaporate more moisture than the roots 
can provide, resulting in the death of the tree. 

Exposure Before Planting. — With proper subsequent treatment a 
tree can endure the loss of many roots, but instead of the needed protection 
it often gets much unnecessary exposure to sun and dry air. 
This may be in digging, packing, shipping, unpacking, or any other of 
the various handlings which it undergoes between its removal from 
the ground and subsequent planting. On a warm day in March the 
writer saw a bundle of trees in shipment across the plains of Texas 
without the slightest covering. Before the destination was reached 
the roots became withered and almost dry, having suffered a hundred 
times more exposure than the ordinary tree can stand without injury, 
many persons would be guilty of such gross neglect, but the fact 
remains that exposure causes the death of more trees in transplanting 
than any other single cause. Exposure can usually be easily prevented, 
and no one who persists in neglectful practices can hope to be 
successful. 

Failure to Plant Well. — The failure to pack the soil tightly about 
the roots is a comon error in planting. It causes injury in two ways: 
It leaves the trees unstable, to be rocked to and fro or even blown down 
by the wind; it also prevents the first growth of rootlets from absorbing 
food. This they can not do unless good, fine soil is firmly pa 
around them. Clods will not pack snugly. Likewise manure or litter 
of any kind mixed with the soil may prevent firm packing. Anything 
that prevents the soil particles from coming into close contact with 
the roots is sure to be injurious. Another error is in shallow planting. 
This allows wind and water to lay bare the roots, and in a short time </seg>

            <seg id="p276">
368 

NBBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

the tree dies. Crowding the roots into too small a hole is a similar 
difficulty. Such errors are more often due to lack of experience and 
skill than to haste. The unskillful planter will hardly plant well, however 
slowly he may go. 

I it Soil. — Trees are often injured by being planted in wet soil. 
:her the excessive moisture is a permanent or a temporary conn 
is likely to make little difference in the results. If it is permathe 
water prevents the air from reaching the roots, while if it is 
temporary the trampling of the soil over them causes it to stick 
her so that on drying it becomes baked, leaving them impacted 
hard lump of earth which excludes the air. Excessive air curi 
in the soil are injurious by drying the roots, but a constant 
eation of the soil by the air is necessary to supply oxygen. This 
?ss is precluded by either the saturation or the baking of the soil, 
ained pockets occur here and there even in well-drained fields, 
ire always difficult to deal with in tree growing. 

Drying Out of the Soil. — Another cause of death is the drying out of 
the soil. Summer droughts are not unknown in any part of the country, 
and are very frequent in parts of the Mississippi Valley and on the 
plains. Occasionally they are so intense and long continued that it is 
difficult to make recently transplanted trees survive, even when carefully 
planted and cultivated. In -such a time, those which are poorly 
planted and cultivated are almost sure to die. Frequently, too, weeds 
and grass grow up in the plantation and draw off the moisture, thereby 
greatly diminishing the supply for the young trees. 

On a school ground there is likelihood of the trees being injured by 
the trampling of the soil. The pupils will naturally wish to play 
among them, and unless they are restrained the soil will soon become 
compacted. It then dries out very quickly, and in time of drought 
the trees are sure to suffer, and may be killed. 

CAEE OF TREES AFTEB PLANTING. 

Cultivation. — Important as the process of planting is, one can never 
be certain that a tree planted with the greatest care will live and reach 
maturity. Much depends upon the after-treatment. In many parts 
of the country cultivation is absolutely essential, and nearly everywhere 
a tree will thrive better and grow faster during its early years 
with cultivation than without it. The purposes of cultivation are 
mainly to protect young trees from the encroachment of weeds and 
grass, to keep the soil in good physical condition, and to retain the 
moisture. Good cultivation is that which serves these purposes without 
injuring the trees. It does not necessarily include deep tillage. 
In fact, deep tillage may be positively injurious by breaking off the 
feeding roots, and is usually not necessary to loosen the soil. Very 
few soils are too hard for tree roots to penetrate if moisture is plentiful. 
The best way to retain moisture is by frequently stirring the 1 
soil to a depth of 2 or 3 inches. The longer cultivation is continued, 
the better will be the effect upon the trees. It should not cease in any 
case until they are well established and prepared to thrive without 
further attention. 

Scattering or isolated trees can not usually be cultivated except by 
occasionally spading up the earth within a circle of a few feet around 
them. This is necessary in order to keep the grass and weeds from 
crowding them and retarding their growth. 

The difficulty in tilling a school-ground plantation will come during 
the vacation period. That is the busy time of the year, when crops 
must be tilled and harvests reaped. Unless the person in charge is </seg>


            <seg id="p278">

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGEICULTVRK. 

be pruned about every third year, but if careful attention is given to 
pruning when it is young, very little later work will be required. 
The best season is late fall or very early spring. Good pruning 
requires care and skill. The best work is done with pruning knife, 
pruning shears, and saw. The branches should be cut off close to the 
trunk, leaving no projecting stub or shoulder. The brush should be 
taken out of the plantation and burned as soon as dry. 

Protection of Tree* From Injury. — The responsibility will devolve 
upon the teacher to inculcate a spirit of respect on the part of the 
pupils for the plantation. The best way to do this is to make them 
feel a responsibility for its success. If they feel a personal pride in 
it, there is little danger of their giving the trees rough usage by bending 
or breaking them. 

In some rural districts where danger of injury from trespassing 
stock is not overcome by an ornamental hedge or by the grouping of 
shrubbery, as mentioned in connection with the planting, the grounds 
should be inclosed by a fence. A neat paling or a fence of woven wire 
will answer the purpose. 

STUDIES FOE THE TEACHER AND SCHOOL. 

A thrifty plantation of trees or a woodland lot presents a field for 
varied and important observation, which the teacher experienced in 
presenting topics of nature study will know how to appreciate. Nowhere 
can better illustrations be found of the operation of many important 
biological laws, and the lessons learned here are sure to be 
remembered, because, once grasped, other examples of the same phenomena 
are certain to be constantly presented to the awakened attention 
of the boy or girl. 

Characteristics of Trees. — Naturally one of the first lessons in this 
forest work will be to study the different kinds of trees, and to learn 
the characteristics which separate them into groups; for example, the 
points of difference between conifers and broadleaf trees, between 
oaks and maples, and even between one kind of maple and another. 

Prominent among the distinguishing characters of trees are their 
twigs, buds, leaves, flowers, and seeds. Great variation will be found, 
variation not only in trees of different kinds but in the same tree at 
different seasons. The summer and winter conditions of twigs and 
buds of deciduous trees are so different that one can scarcely identify 
a tree in winter from a knowledge of its summer appearance. Fig. 9 
shows the winter condition of twigs and buds of Smooth Alder and 
Beech; Fig. 10, the twig and leaves of Horse Chestnut. In studying 
seeds it is important to notice such points as how they are borne, 
their structure, shape, size, time of ripening, and means of dissemination. 
Figs. 11 and 12 show the seeds and leaves of Boxelder, Silver 
Maple, and White Oak. Fig. 13 shows the late winter condition of 
acorns after having begun to germinate the previous fall, while Fig. 14 
shows their condition after a few warm spring days have passed. 

Influence of Soil Upon Trees. — The study of the soil preferences of 
trees is important, because from it we pain a knowledge of one of 
hief factors in tree growth. For this study it is best, if possible, 
to go to the natural woods, for there will be seen the results 
of many years of struggle among numerous species with no help 
from man to aid the growth of one tree or retard that of another. 
r such conditions, when one species establishes itself to the

turning to soil. Below this layer is another of the same material, but

neighboring trees and shrubs. If this soil is examined closely, it will 
be found that it is not like the soil of long-cultivated fields, composed 
uill pebbles and grains of sand, but is made up mostly of decayed

Fio. 19. — White Pine under the protection of Chestnut. 

Pine seedlings are coming up under the sheltering branches of a Chestnut. 
It gives them an increased supply of moisture and partial shade, 
and nowhere else near by have they come up in such abundance. Such 
is frequently the case in the forest. The tender seedlings require the 
protection afforded by the older trees. There is, however, another 
phase of this interesting matter. Within a few years the young seedlings 
reach the stage where they require the sunshine from which they 
needed protection when young. Then the same overtopping trees that 
sheltered them in their infancy become a menace to them. In many 
cases they grow a few years and die. Now and then one finds a gap 
among the tree tops and grows up to occupy it, becoming itself a dominant 
tree in the forest. 

The density of trees greatly affects their growth. The isolated tree 
grows with a short trunk and spreading top, while the crowded one 
produces a long, slender trunk and narrow top. The difference in form 
is caused by the effort of the tree to present its greatest extent of leaf 
surface to the sunlight. Where it stands alone, this is accomplished 
by the top assuming a spreading or rounded form, but where it is 
crowded by others and shaded on all sides, it can reach the sunlight 
only by pushing upward and overtopping its rivals. Hence there is a 
continual struggle among crowded young trees in their upward growth, 
and as they grow their lower branches become more and more densely 
shaded until they die. Decay follows, and soon they drop off, leaving 
the trunk clear of branches. </seg>

«¦¦ PLANTING ON RURAL SCHOOL GB' 

Books and Trees — For the most part, a knowledge of trees can best 
be obtained from the trees themselves. There are some things, however, 
that can be more easily and rapidly learned from books: First, 
we can learn best from books the important things to look for, or 
what to study; second, many inaccessible kinds mnst be stndied from 
books or not at all; third, there are some things about trees that can 
be more readily learned from books than from experiment, such as 
how to handle, transplant, and cultivate them. 

Knowledge will be gained much more quickly, and will be more comprehensive 
and much less likely to include erroneous notions, if obtained 
not alone from the natural objects, but in part from the best 
works on the subject. So, in silvicultural studies, that teaching will 
be most valuable that leads the pupil into both original investigation 
and the study of books. 

FACTS ABOUT TREES. 

Erocessei.— Trees are living things with vital functions and parts. 
ive systems of digestion, assimilation, and respiration, with 
ed organs for carrying on the various processes, much the 
animals. In correspondence with most of the vegetable king:ir 
leaves have the power under the action of sunlight to absorb 
acid gas from the air, to break it up, and, with the carbon 
obtained and water, to form starch. The oxygen is returned to the 
air unused. The water comes directly from the soil through the roots 
and stems, and carries in solution mineral compounds which enter into 
combination with the starch, forming the more complex compounds 
such as the tree can readily utilize. These are drawn away to the 
branches, stem, and roots, there organized into living substance, and 
made a part of the tissues of the tree. 

P carry up the supply of mineral from the roots to the leaves, much 
water is required than the tree can utilize in the formation of 
h. The excess passes off as vapor through the pores of the leaves 
the atmosphere, by a process of transpiration. 

A tree breathes for the same purpose as an animal. It takes in oxygen 
and throws off carbonic acid gas. The process is not centered in 
a special organ, but goes on over all parts of the leaves, branches, and 
roots. In the leaves the breathing goes on through the pores; in parts 
of the tree covered by bark it goes on through the lenticels — the small, 
light-colored, raised spots plainly seen on the young branches of nearly 
all trees. Breathing is an entirely separate process from that by 
which carbonic acid gas is taken in through the leaves and oxygen 
liberated. It goes on both day and night and at all seasons of the 
year, though more rapidly in summer than in winter. 

Life History — A tree has a definite life history as an organism, with 
periods of growth, maturity, and decline, and characteristic development 
in matters of form, structure, and size. There is marked differin 
the rate of growth of different trees, and even of the same 
tree at different ages. Most of the pines grow very slowly for 
first ten or twelve years, but much more rapidly after that. Other 
trees, such as the Tulip-tree, grow rapidly for forty or fifty years, and 
then more slowly. Still others, such as the oaks, have a very regular 
of increase throughout the growing period. Great variation exists 
in the age at which trees become mature. While some reach maturity 
nt the age of fifty or sixty years, many of the most valuable commercial 
trees become mature at from one hundred and fifty to two hundred 
years. The Redwood of California often is not mature before the 
age of a thousand years. A tree will continue to make some growth </seg>


            <seg id="p284">» 

376 


EDugh its maturity and decline, though during its maturity its height 
wth has almost ceased and its diameter growth is slow. Decline 
ins when the destructive forces exceed the growth forces. 

Pen the same climatic and soil conditions, one tree will assume one 
another a form very different. The beech will form a round, 
-branched top, the Bed Cedar a slender tree with a central stem, 
oak will reach majestic proportions, the dogwood will become 
nothing more than a shrub. The hickory will form heavy, elastic wood, 
the birch that which is light and brittle. The pine will yield resin 
and turpentine; the oak, tannin; the maple, sugar. Thus each tree 
preserves perfectly its identity in external form and internal structure 
and composition. 

Reproduction. — A tree reproduces either by seeds or buds. In nature, 
reproduction by seeds is more common, although reproduction by buds 
is quite as regular as by seeds in some species. The tendency of the 
locust to sprout from the roots and of oaks to renew growth from 
the stump are examples of bud reproduction. The forester in handling 
woodlands depends upon both methods. Such trees as reproduce only 
by seeds he keeps by leaving seed trees distributed over the land when 
rop of timber is cut. Those that reproduce from buds renew their 
growth from the stumps of the cut trees. Not only does bud reproduction 
take place when the buds are attached to the parent tree, but 
also when they are separated from it. A tree may be divided into 
many parts, each part becoming a new individual. This gives rise to 
propagation by cuttings, grafts, and buds. Many forest trees can be 
propagated by cuttings, and nearly all can be grafted and budded. 

Food. — In harmony with all other living things, trees require food. 
Their food is composed of the carbon obtained from the air, and the 
water and mineral compounds obtained from the soil. Carbon, oxygen, 
hydrogen, nitrogen, magnesium, calcium, iron, sulphur, phosphorus, 
potassium, and chlorine are called essential elements because, with 
trees as with all other plants, their presence is necessary to thrift. 
Br elements are absorbed when present in the soil in soluble form, 
their absence causes the tree no loss in vigor. The elements are 
absorbed separately and alone, for they rarely exist in that condibut 
are blended together with one another into compounds. Thus, 
ater the plant obtains both hydrogen and oxygen. Potassium, 
&gt;gen, and oxygen are often united in the form of potassium nitrate, 
uable plant food. 

Solubility of Plant Pood. — Trees are able to absorb the mineral compounds 
only as they are in solution in the water taken up by the roots. 
Many compounds of the soil which contain valuable food elements 
are insoluble in soil water, and therefore unavailable. Thus, while 
potassium is an essential element, it may be in such combinations with 
aluminum, silicon, and other elements as to be insoluble and useless, 
ical changes are slowly going on in the soil by which insoluble 
compounds are converted into soluble compounds. Cultivation and fertilization 
hasten such changes, and to do this is one of their chief pur- 

Quantity of Pood.— When the food of a tree is in available form, the 
greater the supply the more rapid its growth. Fertile soil has an 
abundance of food materials, with the result that a tree situated upon 
it grows rapidly. Sterile soil is deficient in food materials, consequently 
a tree situated upon it grows slowly. The same cause, together with 
the conservation of moisture, explains the difference in growth between 
cultivated and uncultivated trees upon the same kind of soil. The cultivated 
tree, with its larger store of food and moisture and its protection 
from the competition of weeds and grass, rapidly outstrips its 
lew fortunate neighbor. </seg>

Essentials to Growth. — A tree can prow only when supplied with sir, 
light, moisture, and heat. 

is necessary because it supplies the oxygen used in the process 
of respiration, and holds the carbonic-acid gas used by the leaTe« in 
forming starch. 

Light is essential that a tree may carry on its process of digestion. 
So sensitive is a tree to light that it will change its form and habit of 
growth to obtain the quantity it needs. In a thickly planted group 
thr trees on the edge will bend outward, while those in the interior 
will grow tall and slender, the growth of each hastening in the direction 
of greatest light. In the absence of light a tree ceases the professes 
of digestion by which its food is prepared for use, and in a short 
time even loses the organs concerned in its preparation; that is, the 
chlorophyl bodies which give the green color to the leaves. 

The necessity of moisture is a matter of common observation. Water 
i- one of the chief agents in the nutrition of a tree, as already mentioned, 
entering into its food in large quantities and serving as a carrier 
of food materials from the roots to the leaves. With the diminution 
of its water supply a tree lessens its growth and sheds part or 
all of its leaves in its endeavor to survive. If the supply continues to 
deerease it finally withers and dies. Yet in their demands for water 
- differ vastly. Some can thrive only with their roots in constantly 
rated soil — as, for example, the Tamarack of the northern and the 
Ifcild Cypress of the southern states. There is every degree of variation 
between trees of this character and those of the desert, where the 
annual rainfall is limited to a few inches. 

&gt;y tree is adapted to a certain range of temperature, depending 
upon its power to endure heat and cold. Some, like the palms, can 
thrive only with a constantly high temperature; others, like most of 
the oaks, are adapted to alternating seasons of heat and cold; still 
others, as some of the birehes and poplars, can endure extreme and 
continued cold, with only a short period each year warm enough for 
growth. Such adaptations account for the distribution of forests over 
nearly the whole of the earth's surface not constantly covered by ice, 
and also largely for the character of the forest in different regions. 
Temperature and moisture principally determine forest distribution 
and growth. 

Local Influences. — Local variations in heat, light, and moisture greatly 
affect tree growth. It is not uncommon to find very different growth 
mi the north side of a mountain from that on the south side, because 
the north side is cooler, moister, and not so light as the south 
-¦ quently trees well adapted to the conditions on the north side 
will nourish there, while on the south side they will make inferior 
growth or not appear at all. West of the Mississippi river the forest 
elings to the margins of streams far beyond the point where it fails on 
ipland, principally because the moisture and atmospheric conditions 
along the streams are more favorable to growth. 

Tree Companionship. — In almost every region certain kinds of trees 
are found together. This is due to a similarity of preferences in regard 
to soil, heat, moisture, and light. Two trees adapted to the same 
conditions will thrive best in the same situation. The White Ash and 
Mack Walnut are good examples. Having similar preferences, they 
have almost identical ranges and are very generally associated. There 
•o another reason why trees accompany one another. A tree may 
ifluence its surroundings as to make them favorable to another 
where otherwise they would be unfavorable. As an example of 
Kueh influence, the Chestnut on sterile, sandy plains in portions of New 
England forma a much-branched tree, which shades the ground and </seg>

            <seg id="p286">

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

keeps it moist and cool. Such conditions are favorable to the germination 
of the White Pine in that region; consequently it is found coining 
up abundantly beneath the Chestnut, but not so abundantly on the 
open, unprotected ground. 

Effect of Change in Surroundings. — A change in the surroundings of 
a tree always modifies its habit of growth. If the change is toward 
more favorable surroundings the result is seen in increased vigor, rate 
of growth, and size; if toward unfavorable surroundings, the reverse 
will be true. The stately Tulip-tree of the central eastern states is 
said to be a mere shrub in Florida. The reason is that there it is out 
of its range of adaptation. The White Elm. which grows with tall 
and vase-like form in New England, in the semiarid parts of Kansas 
and Oklahoma is low and spreading like an apple tree. Nor is form 
the only variable character. On the western elm the leaves are fewer 
in number, smaller, thicker, and much rougher than on the New 
England tree. In other parts of the tree there are differences of the 
same kind, though they are not so noticeable as those in the form and 
foliage. These variations have resulted from the differences in soil and 
climatic conditions to which the tree has been subjected. 

! Gradual Change.— The difference in form between two trees of the 
me kind in different localities has come about through gradual 
vergence of characteristics. To a certain degree changes of this 
nd can be brought about in practice. When a gradual change is made 
the surroundings of a tree a corresponding change takes place in 
ie tree itself. Thus if stock of the New England elm be slowly moved 
estward through many generations, it will gradually change in form 
id other characteristics to be like the western tree; and it must be 
sumed that this change is necessary to enable it to live under its new 
.nditions. 

Sudden Changes.- — Sudden changes in the surroundings of a tree frequently 
cause its death, because it can not quickly change itself to 
meet the requiremepts of its new conditions. The New England elm 
moved at once to the semiarid west is likely to die, because it is not 
adapted to the conditions of soil, light, heat, and moisture of that 
region. In the prairie marshes of northern Indiana there are occasional 
knolls which once supported thrifty oaks of moisture-loving 
kinds. Now that the marshes have been drained the drying out of the 
soil has caused the oaks to die. The change was too sudden. Suddenness 
and intensity of change often account for the failure of trees to 
thrive when moved away from the region to which they were adapted. 
This is also why eastern trees so often die when moved to the west. 
This is why nursery stock grown near by can be more safely planted 
than that grown in a distant region. It is a practical matter, and 
should be generally understood. </seg>

SOME FORAGE PLANTS FOB SUMMER FEED. 

BT T. L. LYON AND A. L. KABCKKB, AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION, 

NEBRASKA. 

Bry important phase in the present trend of farm practice ia the 
:ution of annual forage plants for permanept pastures and 
ws. This is especially pronounced in the trans-Missouri and 
western states. It is the result of an attempt to obtain a larger 
it of pasturage or rough feed for winter use from a given are* 
3, and is naturally most largely followed in regions where perennial 
grasses and clovers grow less luxuriantly, and where the natural 
fertility of the soil is sufficient to endure such treatment. To be immediately 
profitable the increased feed produced must more than 
counterbalance the added yearly expense for tilling the soil and planting 
the seed. In estimating the ultimate profit, the latter charge must 
have added to it the greater deterioration in the soil when cropped 
continuously than when periodically seeded to grasses or clovers. 

OBJECT OP THESE EXPERIMENTS. 

In conducting the experiments to be described, the object has been 
to gather information on the following points of interest to farmers 
and others: 

1. The relative values of certain forage plants for pasturage by milch 

2. The relative values of some of these forage plants for soiling milch 

3. The values of certain of these crops for milk and butter fat production 
when pastured, as compared with the value of the same crop when 

¦ pasturage tests carried on in 1900 were a repetition of those 
in 1898,* the intention being to note such variation as might be 
•d by a difference in climatic conditions or in the individual 
ence or aversion of animals for a certain feed. 

PLAN OF THE EXPERIMENT. 

Bi of land, one-fifth acre in size, were sown to each of the forage 
to be tested. The crops raised on these plots were sown at the 
if year considered most favorable for the germination of the 
ad development of the plant. This had been ascertained approxiin 
previous years. 

When a crop on a test plot intended to be pastured reached a stage 
of growth at which it was considered fit to pasture, it was fenced by a 
m of movable fencing, and one of the dairy cows was placed in 
the enclosure. The cow was allowed to remain on the plot day and 
night as long as it afforded sufficient pasture. She was then removed, 
and the number of days she was kept on plot was taken as indicating 
the length of time that one-fifth acre of the crop in question would 
maintain one cow. One acre may then be regarded as affording pasturage 
for five cows for the period of time determined by the test. Water 
was brought to them in the paddocks, and during midsummer shade 
was provided in the corner of each plot.

When the crop was to be soiled, cutting was begun on the same day 
that the cow was turned on the similar crop fenced for pasturage. 
As much green forage as was needed for one cow was cut daily until 
the entire crop on the plot was consumed. In some cases a one-tenth 
mere plot was used for the soiling test. The cow used in the test' was 
kept in a box stall in a tool, darkened barn and received the green 
feed fresh daily. Both in the pasture and in the barn the cows received 
during the summer of 1900 no other feed except a handful of 
grain at milking time. In 1898 each cow received two pounds of bran 
and two of ground corn daily. 

Ich cow was pastured, in 1900, on a mixed grass pasture composed 
rairie grasses, blue grass, brome grass and white clover, for at 
; one month before being placed on the test crop whether soiled or 
iired, and for at least one month afterwards. An exception to this 
rred in the cases of the cows pastured on rye, for which test 
were taken off of dry feed. In 1898 the same plan was followed 
pt that all cows were pastured on alfalfa instead of mixed graaaea 
there was no exception in the case of the rye. 

PASTURING TESTS. 

BYE. 

Tett in 1898* 

The rye sown on the plot intended for the experiment did not produce 
a sufficiently good stand for a test. A part of a field of rye sown 
the previous September was fenced off, making a one-fifth acre plot. 
This rye had been sown broadcast at the rate of about one bushel to 
the acre. The stand was poor. It would therefore not give a fair test 
of the length of time that the crop would afford pasture, and no record 
is made of it. This, however, will not interfere with a test of its effect 
upon the animal, as she was on pasture for ten days. 

Kune 13 the plot was fenced and a cow was placed in the en. 
The crop was eight to ten inches high and well stooled out. 

K23 she was taken off the plot. She had eaten the crop very 
The weather and other conditions were the same as during the 
pasturing the oats and peas. 

Tett in 1900. 

Ei September 18, 1899, a small piece of rye was drilled in at the rate 
ne and one-half bushels per acre. The season being favorable the 
made a good growth and by the time winter set in the ground wu 
covered. 

The spring of 1900 was somewhat early and by the middle of April 
the rye had made a vigorous growth. On May 1 a one-fifth acre plot 
wa« fenced and a cow turned on. 

Erye at this time had a very good stand, being well stooled and 
two feet high, while many of the heads were starting to show, 
not pastured earlier on account of the exceedingly wet condition 
ground. 

The cow was taken off dry feed such as had been given her during 
the winter, and turned on the rye. This sudden change in feed and 
environment caused a shrinkage in both her milk flow and live weight, 
but after the second week on the plot she returned to her normal flow.

Results for Two Tears. 

The one-fifth acre planted to the crop gave for an average of the two 
yean (1897 and 1900) twenty-seven and one-half days' pasturage. At 
this rate one acre would keep five cows for that length of time. It 
inished the earliest pasturage of any of the annual forage crops, 
t could have been pastured in the fall. It did not induce as large a 
v of milk or production of butter fat as did the mixed grasses 
tured at the same time. It furnished, however, excellent pasturage 
milch cows. 

OATS AND CANADA WHITE FIELD PEAS. 

Test in 1898. 

These were sown for pasture on April 1'6. They were sown broadcast 
at the rate of two bushels of oats and two bushels of peas per acre. 
After sowing they were harrowed twice with a straight-tooth harrow 
to get them well under the ground. 

The land on which all of these crops were planted had been plowed 
in the spring and worked to a good tilth on top. 

K mixed seed sprouted quickly and gave a good stand of oats, bat 
peas. Only about one-quarter of the entire stand was peas. 

BJune 13 the plot was fenced and a cow was placed in the enclosure, 
is time the peas were just starting to bloom and the crop was fa 
condition to pasture. The cow was taken off July 5, making the 
h of time she was on pasture twenty-two days. She ate the crop 
clean, leaving but little vegetable matter. 

¦e weather was moist and cool during the time the cow was on 
pasture, and the flies were not troublesome. 

Test in 1900. 

Canada white field peas and common oats were planted in the following 
manner: 

¦ April 13 the peas were disced in on spring plowed land at the 
of tw» bushels per acre. On April 19 the oats were harrowed In 
e rate of one bushel per acre. By May 1 both the oats and peas 
up and making a good growth. 

Kmost successful method of seeding has been to sow the peas 
ast before plowing, then plow them under about four inches; a 
two. later drill in the oats. Planted in this way and the seed 
proportion used this year, the stand of peas was very satis- 

¦May 31 a cow was turned on. At this time the oats and peas stood 
i two feet high, the peas starting to bloom and the oats to head. 

Result* for Two Years. 

Iie one-fifth acre planted to this crop gave for an average of the 
years, twenty-one and one-half days' pasturage. The pasturage is 
available so early as rye, but lasts a little later, and may be turned 
i a little before Indian corn is fit to pasture. It did not affect so 
rablv the milk or butter fat production as did the mixed grasaea. 
ough the difference in 1900 was very slight. These results were 
it equal to those from the rye. It did not furnish so much pasturas 
rye, and is a more expensive crop to seed. There is also conrable 
loss to the crop from trampling. It is probable that this loy 
is too far south for the best results from the Canada pea. </seg>

IHDIAN OOBIf. 

Test in 1898. 

Southern Horse Tooth corn was used for the test. It was sown May 
90, with a press drill, seeding in rows six inches apart. The seeding 
wu done at the rate of two hushels per acre. It sprouted well and 
gave a good stand. 

R&gt;w was put on the plot June 20. At that time the plants were 
two feet high. She remained on the plot until July 13, a period of 
r-three days. The crop was eaten down to the very woody portion 
stalks. 

KThe conditions of weather, etc., were much the same as for the 
evious tests. 

Test in 1900. 

May 21 the corn was drilled in at the rate of two bushels per acre. 
The rows were six inches apart and at about the same distance in the 
row. A common variety of field corn was used. 

On June 23 a cow was turned on. The corn had made a good growth, 
being about two feet high. 

The plot furnished fourteen days' feed, at the end of which time, 
July 7, it was all eaten off close to the ground. 

The forage suffered much from trampling. The stalks being tender 
would break off when struck or stepped on. 

The flies were very bad during this period, which no doubt caused 
the cow to break down more forage than if not so disturbed. 

Results for Two Years. 

!rhe one-fifth acre planted to this crop gave eighteen and one-half 
ys' pasturage as an average for the two years. It was available a 
tie before the oats and peas were entirely pastured off, and was 
ished about the. time millet, sorghum, Kafir corn and cowpeas were 
ady. It did not affect so favorably the milk or butter fat production 
did the mixed grasses, but nearly as much as the oats and peas. It 
uld be pastured much later in the summer than was done in this 
periment, but is not the equal of sorghum at that season. It may 
of value to furnish feed between the periods of rye and sorghum 
sturage, but it is not equal to either of these. 

MILLET. 

Test in 1898, 

Common German millet was used for the test. It was shown on 
June 2, with a press drill, seeding in rows six inches apart. The seed 
was drilled at the rate of one and one-half bushels per acre. It produced 
a good stand. 

On July 15 a cow was placed in the plot. On this date the crop 
averaged about sixteen inches in height, giving a good stand. She 
remained on the plot until August 4, a period of twenty days. The 
crop was eaten quite close to the ground. 

The weather was quite hot during most of the period. Flies did not 
bother at any time. 

Test in 1900. 

German millet was sown broadcast May 21 at the rate of fifty pounds </seg>

SOME FORAUE PLANTS FOB SUMMER FEED. 

The millet at this time had made a good growth and was about one 
foot high. 

The forage lasted until .Inly 13, giving seventeen days of feed. 

It made a good pasture while it lasted, but the plants after being 
eaten down made a very weak second growth or failed altogether. 

B flies troubled the cow much during this period, which resulted 
h trampling. 

/{ntrilt-i for Txoo Years. 

The one-fifth acre planted to this crop gave eighteen and one-half 
days' pasturage as an average for the two years. It was available at 
the same time as sorghum. Kafir corn, and cowpeas. and in 1900 as early 
as Indian corn. It did not have as favorable an effect upon the milk 
flow or butter fat production as did any of these crops or as did the 
mixed grasses. 

SOBOHUM. 

7V.&lt;t in 1898. 

Ey Amber sorghum was used for the experiment. It was drilled 
June 1, with a press drill, in rows six inches apart, seeding at 
te of two bushels per acre. The seed germinated quickly and 
good stand. 

f&gt;w was put on pasture July 13. At this time the plants were 
two feet high and the stand was good. She remained on the plot 
August 14, a period of thirty-two days. The crop was eaten 
close. 

The conditions of weather, etc., were about the same as during the 
test of millet. 

Test in 1900. 

Hay 31, Early Amber sorghum was drilled in at the rate of two 
bushels per acre. 

The seeding was done with a press drill in rows six inches apart. 

The sorg-hum made a good growth during June and on July 6 a cow 
was put on the plot, the stand being at that time two feet high, thick, 
and heavily leaved. 

The flies being quite bad during the early part of July, the cow did 
much tramping through the forage to brush her legs and sides. This 
knocked down quite a little of the feed, but did not kill the plants. 

On July 17 a good rain started a second growth on the stalks eaten off 
and broken down. 

tOn July 24 the cow was taken out, the forage being eaten to the 
ound. 

In August the second growth made a small stand but not enough to 
warrant turning a cow on for second pasturage. 

Results for Two Years. 

The one-fifth acre planted to this crop gave twenty-five days' pastorage 
as an average for the two years. It was available at the same time 
as millet, Kafir corn, and cowpeas. It furnished more feed than any of 
these, and had a very little less favorable effect on the milk flow and 
butter fat production than the Kafir corn, somewhat less than the 
mixed grasses, and very much less than the cowpeas. The greater 
amount of feed produced would doubtless make it outrank Kafir corn 
as a pasture crop. It makes a very rapid regrowth after being eaten 
down. Under some conditions it is fatally injurious to stock, and its 
use for pasturage when injured by drought or frost cannot be said to 
be safe. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

WHITE KAFIR CORN. 
Test in 1898. 

White Kafir corn was used in preference to the red variety, because 
in previous trials at this station it hail yielded larger amounts of preen 
forage. It was drilled in on June 1, with a press drill, in rows six 
inches apart, seeding at Ihe rate of two bushels per acre. The seed 
germinated in a reasonable length of time and gave a good stand. 

A one-fifth acre plot was fenced and a cow put on pasture July 13. 
At this time the plants averaged two feet high, and the stand wh 
good. She remained on the plot until August 4, a period of twenty-two 
days. It was quite well eaten down. 

The weather and flics were the same as stated for the sorghum test. 

The seed was drilled in on May 31 at the rate of two bushels per 

B turned on the plot. Bj this time the Kafir corn

Knly 24 the cow was taken off, the forage being all eaten and 
owing' signs of hunger. " 

Bugnst the plot produced a small amount of second growth but 
much as the sorghum. 

Hcxults for Ttro Years. 

gone-fifth acre planted to this crop gave twenty days' pasturage 
average for the two years. It did not furnish as much feed as 
urn. but more than millet, both of which admit of pasturage at 
mie time. It had a slightly better influence on the production of 
ind butter fat than did sorghum. It is not free from the injurious 
times displayed by the sorghum. 

COWPEAS. 
Test in 1898. 

The plot of land intended for the pasture test produced a very poor 
I. which "was quite weedy and therefore "would not have given a 
fair test of the peas, either as to amount of pasture afforded, or the 
effect upon milk production. The plan of attempting to find the length 
of time during which a cow could obtain pasture from the plot was 
then abandoned, and she was pastured on a plot of cowpeas, drilled in 
eighteen inches apart. These had been cultivated and were free 
from weeds, so that the teRt was accurate as showing the effect of the 
crop on flesh and milk production. The cow was put on pasture 
mber 6, and taken off September 16. 

Te»t in 1900. 

The plot of cowpeas was planted May 31. They were drilled in with 
a press drill at the rate of one bushel per acre. 

They made a slow growth during June, and not until July 24 was 
rand thick enough to warrant pasturing. At this date a cow was 
turned on the plot which had a stand of peas about one foot high. 

Bplot furnished good pasturage until August 13, when all the 
was consumed and the cow taken off. 

During the time the cow was pasturing on the plot the flies were 
quite bad and the weather was very warm.

Re*ulU for Two Years. 

The one-fifth acre planted to the crop furnished twenty days' pasturage 
during 1900. No test was made In 1898 of the amount of feed produced, 
but the effect upon the milk flow and amount of butter fat 
produced was noted. In this respect the forage far surpassed all of 
the other crops except alfalfa, and was even slightly superior to that 
very valuable forage plant. Calculating from the average results for 
the two years, a cow would have produced more milk in twenty days 
on the cowpeas that she would in twenty-five on the sorghum. In 
other words, the experiments show that an acre of land planted to 
cowpeas would produce more milk than if it were planted to sorghum. 

ALFALFA. 

Test in 1899. 

The amount of pasturage furnished was less than by any of the 
annual forage crops, although the effect upon the milk flow and production 
of butter fat was more favorable than that of any of these 
crops except cowpeas, and better than the mixed grasses. Alfalfa has 
two great disadvantages as a pasture plant. It is very likely to produce 
bloat in cattle and sheep, and it is easily killed by overpasturing. 
For these reasons the use of alfalfa alone for pasturage is not to be 
recommended, in spite of its highly nutritious qualities. 

BBOMCB XNERMI8. 

Test in 1899. 

The amount of pasturage furnished was a little more than half as 
much as that obtained from the alfalfa during the same part of the 
summer. It produced very little less milk and butter fat than did the 
mixed grasses. It may be considered an excellent pasture grass for 
dairy stock. 

MILLO MAIZE, SOT BEAN8, HAIRY VETCH. 
Test in 1898. 

Millo maize, soy beans, and sand or hairy vetch were also tested 
during one year, but were not considered of sufficient present value tt&gt; 
entitle them to participation in the second year's test which on aecount 
of the number of animals and amount of labor required was 
restricted to certain more or less typical plants. 

The one year's test indicated that millo maize possessed no marked 
advantage over Kafir corn; that soy beans produced feed of about the 
same quality as cowpeas, but a much smaller quantity; that sand or 
hairy vetch was inferior to cowpeas both as to quality and quantity of 
feed produced, besides which the price of seed is such as to make its 
use impracticable at present. 

SOILING TESTS. 

ALFALFA. 

The soiling test for one year as compared with the pasturage test 
for the same year indicated that about twice as much feed was secured 
from the land when the alfalfa was soiled as when it was pastured. 
The average daily production of milk and of butter fat was markedly 
greater when the crop was pastured than when soiled. In one test 
this amounted to one-third more, but in the other test the difference 
was not so great. The profits from soiling- as compared with pasturing 
win depend largely on two factors — the price of labor and the value of 
the land. </seg>


            <seg id="p294">
386 


SORGHUM. 

The soiling test for two years as compared with the pasturage test 
for the same years indicated that from two to three and one-half times 
aa much feed was secured from the land when the sorghum was soiled 

as when it was pastured. When pastured the average daily production 
of butter fat was greater than when soiled, but as with corn the 
difference is too slight to be of practical importance. 

INDIA* OOKN. 

The soiling test for the one year as compared with the pasturage 
test for the same year indicated that between two and three times as 
much feed was obtained from the land when the crop was soiled as 
when it was pastured. When pastured, the average daily production of 
milk and butter fat was greater than when soiled. This, howerer, 
would not by any means compensate for the greater amount of feed 
secured by soiling. 

SUMMARY. 

eguminous crops with the exception of sand or hairy vetch ina 
larger daily milk and butter fat production than did any of 
ler crops. 

2. Rye and sorghum were the crops affording the largest amount of 
pasturage. 

3. The experiments indicated that cowpeas produced an actually 
greater quantity of milk and butter fat from a given area of land 
than any other crop. 

4. A comparison of the relative amounts of feed produced by several 
forage crops when pastured and when soiled indicated that the latter 
practice secures two to three times as much feed from the same area 

L5. The same tests indicated that the average daily production of milk 
id butter fat was greater for the same feed when the cow was 
pastured than when soiled. This on an average amounted to 1.17 
times greater butter fat production from the pastured than from the 
soiled crop. </seg>

FEEDING SKIM-MILK TO (VIA KS. 

BT A. L. HAECKER, AOBICULTL'RAL EXPERIMENT STATION. NEBRASKA. 

This experiment is an attempt to show the profit of raising beef 
calves on separator milk as compared with that derived from allowing 
them to suck their dams. 

DEMAND FOR INFORMATION. 

During very recent years the rapid advance of skimming stations in 
our western range country has introduced a change in the method of 
stock raising. 

In sections where these stations and creameries are in operation, it 
has been found desirable to milk the cows and rear the calves on skimmilk. 
This change has raised a few important questions as to the 
difference in the two methods of raising calves. 

Buries have been received respecting the cost of rearing calves 
e two methods, and also as to the final development of these 
into steers,-— whether or not a skim-milk fed calf could be grown 
good a steer as one raised by running with its dam. 

Bjbtain some accurate information along this line it was thought 
ble to make it the subject of an experiment. 

THE EXPERIMENT. 

ee spring of 1899. six cows were selected of western range stock, 
ring markings of grade Shorthorn and Hereford. They were mil 
to a pure-bred Hereford bull, and were due in May and June. 

¦ cows were divided into two lots, care being taken to make them 
for both milk and beef purposes. 

¦ calves from Lot I were weaned from their dams, while those 
Lot II were allowed to run with them. 

On May 1st both lots were turned on a good pasture of mixed gnuo, 
which was their only feed until late fall. They dropped their calves 
on the following dates:

Owing to one of the cows losing' her calf a Shorthorn Jersey cross 
was substituted, which is calf No. 1. The rest showed the Hereford 
blood, and all were males except calf No. 2. 

HOW THE CALVES WERE FED. 

The calves in Lot I were fed in the following manner: After birth 
they were allowed to suck their dams three or four times, when they 
were taken away and taught to drink whole milk. The whole-milk 
ration was given them for about ten days, when they were changed 
gradually to skim-milk. At the time of this change a little flaxseed 
meal was stirred into the milk to take the place of the lacking butter 
fat. Nearly a week was required to shift from whole milk to skimmilk 
in order to keep the calves from being set back by the change. 
E skim-milk used in this experiment was produced by a hand power 
hine and was always fed warm from the separator. During the 
r "period" it was fed in small rations of about four quarts. The 
flaxseed meal was fed in the milk, a ration being about a tablespoonfnl, 
or one-half ounce. 

At the end of the second period the calves were taught to eat ground 
feed by putting a little into their mouths after they had finished drinking 
their milk. In this way the calves soon learned to eat ground corn 
and oats, which was always fed to them after drinking. 

COST OF RAISING SKIM-MILK CALVES. 

As the ration tables will show, they had pasture during the second 
and third periods, after which they were kept in the barn, the pasture 
being replaced good alfalfa hay. 

The following tables will show the cost and amount of feed consumed 
daring each period, also the cost of one pound of gain in live weight. 

Nos. 1 and 2 were fed skim-milk for seven periods, being older than 
No. 6, which at the end of five periods had to be changed with the 
others, as the test closed at that time. 

In order to find the cost of feed 

the following market prices were 

used: 

Whole milk, $1.00 per cwt. 
Skim-milk, 15 cents per cwt. 
Flaxseed meal. $3.00 per cwt. 
Ground oats, 25 cents per bushel. 
Ground corn, 25 cents per bushel. 
Alfalfa hay, $4.00 per ton. 

Pasture for cows, 25 cents per week. </seg>

DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO METHODS OP RAISING CALYES. 

To find some way of estimating the profit of raising calves on skim- 

milk. Lot I was credited with the butter produced by the cows of Lot 

I, and the market value was placed at eighteen cents per pound. 

Phe labor of feeding the calves and milking the cows has not been 
sidered in this table owing to the great difficulty in finding a fair 

basis. It must be kept in mind, therefore, that Lot I required much 

more labor than Lot II, but after the two lots were weaned they all 

received equal care and food rations. 

Figuring the value of the calves and milk produced by their dams a* 

receipts, and cost of feed as expenses, Lot I netted $50.27 more than

THE QUALITY OP SKIM-MILK CALVES. 

As to the quality of the calves in the two lots, it was quite easy at 

the end of the fifth and sixth periods to pick out the sucking calvea 

they were rounder in body and had better coats, but at one year 

old this difference could not be detected. 

In order to give this a fair test, stockmen not familiar with the indi- 

viduals were called upon to pick out the skim-milk calves, which they 

were unable to do. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

In conclusion it may be safely said that, by careful feeding, good 

steers can be raised on skim-milk by using ground feed to replace the 

lost butter fat. 

The cost of feed for a skim-milk calf raised to six months old was 

about nine dollars.
