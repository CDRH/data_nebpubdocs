Arrange- ments have been made by the State Board of Agriculture to enter- tain the delegates to this meeting, at a dinner at the Lincoln Hotel at 6:30 tonight, and those who have not yet received their tickets, please apply to Mr. Dickman for them. It is only fair to those in charge of this dinner that we let them know pretty soon how many are going to attend this dinner tonight, as they have not so very much time to make preparations as it is. Those who attend should see Mr. Dickman at once. The State Board of Agriculture will furnish these tickets free of charge to the members who can go tonight. Mr. McArdle: That is cheap enough. Everyone will be there, I bet. Mr. McNutt: The delegate from Greeley County could not be here and Mr. A. J. O'Keefe was sent at the last minute, and haa no credentials.

Before we take up the matter of nominations, I will give you the report of the President. To the Members of the State Board of Agriculture Another year has passed into history, and with it are recorded the acts of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, the principal one of which was the holding of the annual Nebraska State Fair to which we can point with pride; this being the best and most extensive fair ever held, both in the matter of attendance and exhibits, which I will touch upon later. But the efforts of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture are not confined to lines of exposition work alone. We believe we have a broader field in instructing the many thousands of the people in our state engaged in agricultural pursuits and the raising of live stock, how to best increase all lines of farm products and their values, and we are firm in our belief that one of the best ways to accomplish this result is through object lessons, for which the exhibi - tions at our annual state fair are an excellent opportunity, and healthy competition through competitive exhibits furnishes a splendid incentive to a higher class of productions. The progress of our state I wish to show by drawing your atten - tion to one particular line as an illustration — the horse industry. We find that Nebraska is the sixth horse producing state in the Union. At the time the automobile began to figure so prominently the prediction was made that the horse would decline in value; but true to his noble nature, he has given the lie to this prediction. The Nebraska farm horse has done much better than its Ohio brother, by outstripping that state and putting Nebraska in the sixth rank, while Ohio takes the place Nebraska held in 1900 as seventh place. So prolific has been the Nebraska farm horse that in 1910 we find him showing an increase of 213,060 in numbers over 1900 and $66,141,548 in value. This is equal to nearly t1% increase in numbers, and more than 180', in value. According to the revised census, the seven leading states in the horse industry are as follows, with Nebraska leading in the matter of increase in numbers and values: Iowa Illinois .... Texas No. Head 1,392,573 1,350,219 1,269,432 979.695 967,037 . 795,318 878 205 No. Head 1,492,226 1,452,887 1,170,068 1,147,056 1,073,387 1,008,378 Farm Teams 99,653 102,680 993,64 167,361 106,350 213,060 I Kansas. . . Missouri Nebraska '. .. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 I'KOCKKIHNCiS NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE HORSE VALUES tThe relative position of Nebraska in the above figures applies only to horses, but also to other lines of agricultural industry, instance, the farm products of Nebraska including her live stock hed the almost inconceivable total last year of $609,242,466. ; means $510 for every person residing in our state, $2,550 for y family of five. Compare this with any other agricultural munity in the United States, or in the world for that matter, you must feel proud of Nebraska, proud that you are one of sons of toil. It is not necessary for me to continue along this line, for the resources of Nebraska is too great a subject to be more than sug - gested in the time that I have, and as our worthy Secretary will furnish you with plenty of facts and figures to take home with you, I will take up other parts of the work. Unless all signs fail the State of Nebraska is due within a very few years, to take a much more prominent place in the group of western states embraced in the Mississippi Valley, and which now constitute the chief source of supply for national food products. Our state already ranks high in the list, but the possibilities of our soil and climate are just beginning to be realized. There have been many unusual and remarkable yields during the past year, many farms having brought their owners revenue ranging as high as $75.00 per acre, which has opened the eyes of Nebraska people to the fact that for dependability year in and year out, there is no better agricultural proposition than a good Nebraska farm. The farm lands of Nebraska are as yet in a comparatively virgin state as compared with the older states of the corn belt, and we have yet to experience the inflation of land values and the increase of farm products which comes as a result of congested agricultural population. If there is any question of greater importance to every inhabitant of our state than the question of the proper conservation of our farm lands, we have yet to discover what it is. Nebraska is primarily an agricultural state, and as such, we may ask, is agriculture today receiving due recognition from the people of our state that it deserves? Since I have outlined some of our agricultural needs, I will take this opportunity to ask a few questions and answer them myself. What duties are we leaving unperformed, which if properly performed would increase the effi - ciency of the Nebraska farm, and also increase the annual output? Illinois Missouri Nebraska 77,720,577 69,698,100 42,094,814 43,758,334 36,663,359 50,159,245 34,497,083 177,999,124 163,363,400 118,976,563 112,758,108 102,804,907 98,910,638 84,024,639 100,278,547 93,665,300 71,881,749 68,999,774 66,141,548 48,751,393 49,527.552 97.2 142.9 </seg>
            <seg id="p013">PROCKEIHNGS NKKHASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRlCt'LTl'RF 13 Ere is certainly room for improvement in this direction, and upon proper answer to these questions propounded depends the further perity of not only the farm, but also our cities and the great monwealth. I From a careful observation of many states it seems to me tha first great lack in Nebraska agriculture today is lack of know! concerning our own resources. Our soil and climate condition so varied throughout our state, and our crops so diverse, tha mation on these matters at the present time is very genera in no way specific. Another great lack in our state according to my view is the lack of enthusiasm among the farmers. Every farmer should be a booster, and satisfied that there is no state in the Union quite so prosperous as our own. The third great lack is undoubtedly the lack of co-operation between the cities and rural districts, educational institutions and the people, and between the farmers themselves. We lack con - centrated effort, team work on the part of every man and every organization interested in even a remote way in agriculture. Possibly the greatest lack i Nebraska agriculture, in my esti - mation, is lack of publicity, which no doubt is responsible for the first lack mentioned, that of the knowledge of our own resources. We may know in a general way the possibilities and the value of Nebraska farm lands, but we have been too careful to keep this information to ourselves, with the result that we have been merely the transfer point, instead of the destination of the land-seeking public for all these past years. Unless these conditions are corrected and the general agricultural movement in the state re-directed along conservative progressive lines, it seems to me it will be impossible for Nebraska to take the place among western states which the should occupy agriculturally. It is with this thought in view that the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has taken a step in this direction, having established a department of publicity undertaking to supply the general public with some of this information so long neglected. While we have no funds at our command other than those made by our own efforts, we trust that this line of work will be so appreciated by the public that the attention of our law makers may be called to what we are trying to do and that a suitable appropriation may be made, so the work can be enlarged upon and the whole world may know the resources of one of the greatest states in the Union — Nebraska. VISIT TO OTHER STATE FAIRS Mr. Mellor, your Secretary, and I were delegated by you to visit the Illinois and Missouri State Fairs. As my county fair came during the same week as the Missouri Fair, it was impossible for me to leave home, and it was also impossible for Mr. Mellor to go. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 l'KU( KKPINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I following week we both attended the Illinois Fair. They have nificent buildings for all departments except swine and sheep, which dings were in course of construction at the time of the Fair. The ois legislature had appropriated in 1911 $215,000 for buildings; 000 for maintenance; $20,000 for premiums. This is the way Illinois State Fair has been taken care of, so it is not surprising they have such fine buildings in which to house their exhibits. ir exhibits of horses, cattle, hogs, sheep and farm machinery &gt; good; but their display of agricultural products could in no compare to that of our Nebraska State Fair. Why, bless just two of our county collective exhibits would show more r than they had exhibited from the entire state. tl am not so certain but what it might be a step in the right tion if Nebraska would send an agricultural exhibit to the &gt;is State Fair. Some other states had exhibits there. t Leaving Springfield, we went to Sedalia, Missouri, and although Fair was a thing of the past, we looked upon the ruins of a e Fair that had had an attendance of about 80,000 the week re. They, like the State of Illinois, have some very fine, sub - tial buildings. Among the most prominent and useful were Ladies' Comfort Building, erected at a cost of $30,000. In this l all the modern conveniences for the ladies' and children's rest i, Ladies' Hall, Dining Hall, Toilets, Bath, and a nursery for children where they could be left in competent hands while - parents enjoyed the fair. I We saw many other things of interest, some of which we feel can put to good use upon our own State Fair Grounds, but to go i detail would take up too much time. Suffice it to say, that all all, Nebraska has nothing of which to be ashamed, especially n you take into consideration that all the help the Fair Associa - . has had from the state is $130,000. Since coming to Lincoln, Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has paid $168,000 in per - lent improvements out of its earnings, making the present prop - ■ belonging to the State of Nebraska valued at $325,000. I From our observation, we believe that Nebraska has the bes anced all-round Fair of any of our sister states. I would like say that in all my traveling and inquiry, I find that the Nebraska ite Fair is managed as economically as any State Fair. As an istration we will take Minnesota. We were told by the advertis man of the Minnesota State Fair, who I believe was the assis it Secretary, that it cost them $25,000 to get 342,000 people to •ir Fair, which would mean about seven and one-half cents pe &gt;ita; while we in Nebraska spent $4,948.81 to get 166,934 to r Fair, or a cost of two and nine-tenths cents per capita. Thi only one of the many illustrations which I might name to show ; economy used in running our Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 15 TRIP TO NATIONAL CONVENTION AT CHICAGO At the semi-annual meeting on the State Fair Grounds last September you 'selected a delegation to attend the National Con - vention at Chicago of which I was a member. At this meeting there were thirty-six states represented. Some of the questions which were under discussion were: No passing without turnstiles. Efficient advertising for the State Fair LAre State Fairs fulfilling their mission; if not, wherein are they ient? How to handle auto gates with cash turnstiles Good weather insurance. J These are but few of the many papers read and discussed a t meeting, from which we received some ideas which no doub be of value to our management in the years to come; but also frank to say that the Nebraska Fair is managed as well lot better, when all its many different branches are considered any state represented at this meeting. I Nebraska was well represented and took her part in the discus is, and the impression made by the delegates can best be show the fact that we landed our worthy Secretary as Vice-Presiden the American Association of Fairs and Expositions. Also, Secre y Mellor was elected Chairman of the Legislative Committe ring in charge the general appropriation bill before Congress ich asks for an appropriation for every state in the Union ownin te Fair Grounds, giving him power to act and appoint such com tees as he might think best. We Nebraskans should certainl 1 proud that we have such a great and efficient Secretary, as i 1 be only a short time — two years at most — until he will b ded as President of the American Association of Fairs and Expos NEBRASKA STATE UNIVERSITY AND ITS SHOWINGS MADE AT THE INTERNATIONAL STOCK SHOW At the International Live Stock Show held in Chicago last December, our own University of Nebraska took away nearly $1,000 in prizes. The University won grand championship, and three first prizes in the carcass contest. The total winnings of the University during the week, were two championships, nine firsts, four seconds, four thirds, four fourths, and one fifth prize. The animals entered were twelve cattle and six hogs. This is certainly a great victory for our state, especially when you consider that this show is open to the world. This shows very conclusively that Nebraska is crowding to the front. Nebraska is certainly fortunate in having such able and learned men in all departments of our State University, and we ought to stand shoulder to shoulder behind our University. </seg>

RECOMMENDATIONS II would like to recommend the following improvements to be e upon the Fair Grounds in 1913, or as soon thereafter as the •d of Managers may see their way clear to add same: Sanitary drinking fountains, bleachers west of grandstand, cement floor under the grandstand, new agricultural, horticultural, and manufacturing hall which was recommended to you at the semi-annual meeting held on the Fair Grounds last September; more modern toilet rooms in different parts of the grounds; the laying out of camping ground and lighting of same, Superintendent for same who shall maintain an office and keep a register of every person camping, and where located so that they may be easily found, and a ticket provided so that the campers can go back and forth to town to purchase supplies; a new swine pavilion; boy's school along the lines adopted by the Illinois State Board of Agriculture; enlarg - ing the supply pipe from the water main to closet connections so that they will flush oftener; headquarters to be established for Superintendent of sanitation, and rules made showing the duty of said Superintendent; more check stands to accommodate all patrons. TO SUPERINTENDENTS AND EMPLOYEES tl feel very grateful indeed for the cheerful and efficient manner which the Superintendents handled the various departments, a single complaint was made to me. This is a remarkable fact n you take into consideration the magnitude of the show. Every erintendent and employee to the best of my knowledge worked the very best advantage, performing their various duties faith- V and cheerfully. It was certainly a pleasure to see them use •y effort to please and entertain the visitors at our Fair. Jin conclusion, I want to thank the Board of Managers, as well each member of the State Board of Agriculture, for the uniform dness and the willingness to assist in every way possible. I fully lize that it was through the united efforts of all connected with State Board of Agriculture, that it is possible to pass into history 1912 Nebraska State Fair as a record breaker in point of exhibits, endance, and money received. Mr. Graff: There is a matter that I would like to bring up here if I may, and it is in order, and that is the matter of cheap </seg>
            <seg id="p017">17 entertainments on the Fair grounds — entertainments that do not appeal to more than five per cent of the patrons of the Fair. I think the people have been demanding a better class of entertain - ment the last two or three years. They seem to have passed the age where anything will entertain them. I am frank to say I'd be in favor of cutting out entirely the cheap entertainment feature. I think we ought to have fewer and better entertainments out there. These cheap affairs are an eyesore to the people, and then we could have that much more room for good clean concessions. CHEERS. Mr. Rudge: I don't know whether that is out of order at this time or not, but any way, I think that we might refer that to th° Board of Managers and leave it to them.

Mr. Whitten, we have just voted thanks to your club for your kindness and courtesy in extending to us the use of these rooms for our meeting. As President of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, I want to extend the thanks of that association to your club for your courtesy and kindness in the matter. I Mr. Whitten; Mr. President and Gentlemen: I came here to welcome you to the city, because I think you know that you always welcome to Lincoln. I came rather to make our excuses not having the building in apple-pie order for you at this meet- Mr. Mellor served notice on us a good many months ago, am Rudge, who is one of the Board of Directors, has also been very ve in trying to get the marble workers, and the other people w e to deal with, to get busy so we could have the building in class order for you; but Mr. Rudge fell down on the furniture the marble workers had trouble in getting their material, am [ am here to make excuses for Mr. Rudge and for the marbl I The State Board of Agriculture has the honor, if you will permit to put it that way, of holding the first meeting in the new Lin i Commercial Club building. We had rather hoped that things ht regulate themselves so that the club itself could have one o get-together meetings, and we would have that honor; however are willing and glad to give it to you, and I hope you will come n, and whenever you do come, you will find we have no latch igs on our door — the door is always wide open. I This State Board of Agriculture and allied meetings of Organized iculture has got to be a sort of pet with us, and I do not know that it will have the effect of making me a real farmer. I hope at least, as I am certainly interested in this wonderful state of s. The more I hear of its productiveness and the rank it has taken ing the older states of the.

We have no excuses to offer for this state, gentlemen, it is one of the very best that the sun shines on, and I think that you men, you fellows with the grey hairs, are the men to whom a great deal of the credit and honor is due for the wonderful progress this state has made. I hope that your meetini here will be a very successful one, and I am sure it already mus have attained some degree of success or you would not all be lookin so happy. While you are here in this city I want you to come an make yourselves perfectly at home in these rooms. If there is any service I can ren - you while here I want you to call upon me just the same as you would your own hired man. Gentlemen, I thank Calls for Mr. Rudge. Mr. Rudge: I think Mr. Whitten has said about all that can be said along this line. There is just one thing I should like to emphasize, and that is that the Lincoln Commercial Club building is open at any and all times to visitors from the state. Any time you are in the city you are at liberty to come up here and make use of the club rooms. You do not have to be a member in order to come here, they are yours as much as ours. The people who visit the city are always the guests of this Commercial Club, and while you are attending these meetings, this room or any other room in the building, is open for your entertainment. I trust by the time we meet another year, or by the time you come to the city again, we will have this building finished, and we want you to come up and inspect it and make your headquarters here any time you wish. We are going to serve lunches, the billiard room is always open, and while these are not entirely free from expense, it is but very little, and everything outside of these is free. We have one of the most comfortable and nicest reading rooms in the city and we would be only too glad to entertain you. tMB. Graff: I believe there is an apology due to Mr. Rudge ng it for granted that these farmers are billiard players. I sup - i Mr. Rudge meant all right.

You will make no mistake in selecting such a man to serve upon this honorable Board. Mr. Youngs is an honest man; he is also a live wire. He is interested in agricultural perfection; the improvement of the agriculture of the state; he is the sort of man that gets our state into the front rank and keeps it there.

SECRETARY'S REPORT To the Officers and Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: I Greeting: The people of Nebraska have much of which to proud. The more we study into the local conditions in corn - son with like conditions in other states, the more we become ified that we are located favorably so far as nature's blessings bestowed. The closer we study government statistics the more are impressed with the land of our citizenship. Our people irally enjoy life and participate in its luxuries to as great • •ee as those of any community on earth. tThe fact that these conditions actually exist in Nebraska is y substantiated in the government census which for 1910 shows per capita of wealth for our rural population to be $2,360 — the &gt;nd largest in the United States. In the year 1912 the Bureau Statistics say we raised 164,376,786 bushels of corn, enough to ke a solid pile sixty-five feet high over a quarter section of land enough to give every man, woman and child living in Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p024">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 24 137 bushels. To transport this amount of corn would take 275,000 freight cars. We also raised 50,663,097 bushels of wheat, or enough to bake thirty-eight one pound loaves of bread for every person in the United States. Our oats amounted to 46,975,346 bushels. We also passed the two million ton mark in alfalfa, or to be exact, 2,181,849 tons, which added to 3,530,977 tons of hay, partially explains why our people have a per capita wealth in cattle of $110.00, while our nearest competitor has but $88.00. In view of these conditions in Nebraska, it is but just and proper that our State Fair should be one of the recognized up-to-date American fairs and, although held in a state which is twenty-eighth in point o population, still holds the enviable record of being seventh in attend ance. The total attendance of the fair of 1912 was 166,964 at the main gates, which is a record for the Nebraska State Fair. Thi is not the only record broken during the last year, as we also broke a record in the funds received, which amounted to $104,330.20 The total receipts from the fairs of 1900, 1901 and 1902 were $96, 746.08, or more than $7,500.00 less than the fair of 1912, while in the three years mentioned the expense for secretary and clerl hire was more than double that paid for the excess returns of the past year, which is also true as to the expense of our managing board. Possibly the greater number of people in this world find the pinnacle of enjoyment in financial success. Some strive man - fully to acquire oratorical ability, and their moments of keenest enjoyment are experienced when the realization comes that they are swaying the multitude before them. To the soldier the memor - able moment comes in the realization of victory. The newspapers of less than a month ago proclaimed the great joy of an eastern university professor who after nine years of labor had finally in vented a machine which permits him to accurately measure th breath of a grasshopper. There is no certain rule which govern the feeling of satisfaction. The knowledge of success in under taking brings sweet memories to all, therefore we are sure that you will pardon the management of the State Fair in a justifiable feelin of pride when contemplating the results obtained in 1912. (The week following the 1912 State Fair, Wallace's Farmer, a er published outside of the state and therefore reflecting an iased attitude, said — "The forty-fourth annual Nebraska State ' held at Lincoln last week was the most successful recorded in history of the state. A light rain Monday morning put the inds in good shape for the rest of the week. While the attend - i was cut down on that particular day, it was more than made by the end of the week. Nebraska has been favored by good &gt;s, and the Nebraska farmer feels prosperous this year, and lequently he came to the Fair in large numbers. On Wednesday, big day, in round numbers were 60,000 people on the Fair inds. This exceeded by several thousand the number recorded any one previous day. The grounds were packed and crowded </seg>
            <seg id="p025">rtllK'KKHINCS NCHRASKA STATK BOARD OF AdRKl'l.Tl UK 25 iiost to the limit. The attendance on the other days was not large, but was ample to make the Fair a financial success. The eral character of the crowds could not be excelled. The Nebraska mer comes to the Fair partly for relaxation, but mostly to learn. He iterested in the best kind of live stock, in the labor saving machin - , and improved kinds of fruits and grains. He comes early and s in all the morning studying the educational features of the r, and in the afternoon he likes to sit in the amphitheatre and k the winners in the horse races. Sometimes he comes on the in, but often he drives his own automobile and brings the whole lily with him. He is a pretty substantial fellow and nowhere a he show to better advantage than at the annual State Fair. ' The Board has done well with the material at hand, and have given th" people a good fair, which is well patronized by the farmers and stockmen from all over the state. The State Legislature here - tofore seems to have taken the position that the State Fair is a local institution. Nothing could be further from the truth. The State Fair is a state institution of great educational value, and as such it should be given generous support. There is a crying need for a number of improvements before the Nebraska State Fair ca approximate its proper place in the development of agriculture i the state. Most important of all is the demand for a big Agr cultural Hall. This is almost imperative before another fair i held. A suitable building would not only care for the agricultura exhibits, but for the horticultural and floricultura! as well. 1 would be a credit to the state and the agricultural interests of th state, which are second to none in all the trans- Missouri country The Fair is rapidly outgrowing its present quarters, and additiona acreage will be needed before many years. New buildings of per manent character are needed also to house the dairy, poultry an&lt; educational exhibits. The hog and sheep men should be suppliec with an up-to-date barn where stock would be comfortable." During the year we have many times called attention to the educational side of the State Fair. At first some unthinking persons scoffed the educational idea, but as it is an actual fact, it easily bears investigation with final conviction. The annual State Fair is the shew wirdow of the progress of agriculture in all its phases, embodying its best products in gala array, from which a liberal rdveatir n may be obtained from the best educational institution ire mild cf man has yet devised — the school of object lessons. The State Fair school with its finished products, in every depart - ment of farm life on which the State of Nebraska depends for its prosperity, is the place where all original incentive for pedigreed Mock has been born; where ambition for better conditions in all angles of life on the farm is quickened, from the application of ideas gathered and originated from this great storehouse of knowl - edge. The self-education possible to attain through constant visits to the State Fair is more valuable because of the method by which </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE it is gained than any other form of education in the same length of time A spontaneous learning acquired through the State Fair's object lessons, and an interesting course, remains in the memory where less impressive lessons flit quickly away. If a farmer from the great wheat growing belt of our state desires to purchase one of the great modern farm tractors he should by all means visit the State Fair where he will see the various oil-pull and steam tractors, both high wheel and caterpillar. There he will see the various improvements with which the many machines are clothed each succeeding year, and each machine handled by an expert. By a careful study of the excellencies of each he can intelligently select the particular machine best suited to his needs. I The same conditions apply to animals. Many farmers who in doubt as to the particular breed of animal to finally adhere can dispel that doubt by making a careful study of the animals bited, together with feeding and other information to be secured i our Experiment Station exhibits, and from such knowledge :e an intelligent selection for future prosperity. Farmers have us that a visit to the State Fair has saved them months of :rimentation and many times the cost of the trip. If you are interested in Nebraska's growth and prosperity you must be interested in one of its greatest educational institutions, which is our claim for the State Fair. "Oh, but the State Fair only lasts five days, while other educational institutions commonly run nine school months" is the common statement. Well, let us digest this fact. The Nebraska State Fair has as many in daily attendance in the five days as a school of one thousand pupils during the entire school year. Our great Nebraska State University, the peer of any such institution of learning in the United States, has a present enrollment of 3,600 pupils, not all of whom attend for the full year. If they should each be present every day of the school year the number of single daily attendances would be 648,000. The number of daily attendances at the 1911 State Fair was 162,729, and for 1912 — 166,964, each year showing more than twenty-five per cent as great an attendance in comparison with the greatest institu - tion of learning in this part of the country. For the two years it cost the taxpayers $1,706,000 to run the University, while during the same period of time it cost the taxpayers $15,000 for repairs to the grandstand and $4,000 toward premiums, or a total of $19,000, as against $1,706,000 for four times the number of days in attend - ance. This comparison is not made to belittle the University which is ably fulfilling the mission for which it is intended, but for the purpose of setting you to thinking along the right line as to the value of the State Fair. The University is the school to prepare the young to intelligently meet life's activities, while the State Fair with its object lessons is the only school to which the busy man, the man who is bearing the burden of life in properly providing for his family, the man who is paying the taxes for the running </seg>

The wisdom of adopting a permanent plan for our future fair grounds at the last winter meeting eliminates a conflict of opinion as to location and permits an intelligent placing of improvements with an eye to future completeness. In addition to an expense of $3,260.58 for repairs, we have paid out for permanent improvements on the Fair grounds during the year of 1912, a total of $37,139.54, made up of the following Barn (speed) $843.00 Bleachers 812.13 Cinders 373.90 Coliseum walks 799.04 Electric wiring 576.68 Entrance (south) 2,680.03 Excavations 3,079.52 Judges' stand 589.28 Machinery hall 23,888.28 Metal and roofing 2,173.92 Miscellaneous 1,323.76 Total $37,139.54 The total paid out for permanent improvements by the State Board of Agriculture from the time of the purchase of the permanent rtion in 1901, in annual sums, is as follows: 1901 On purchase of grounds (Lincoln citizens) $4,300.00 1901 Permanent improvements 4,371.85 1902 Permanent improvements 4,713.00 1903 Permanent improvements 4,238.00 1904 Permanent improvements 666.76 1905 Permanent improvements 11,814.84 1906 Permanent improvements 4,248.26 1907 Permanent improvements 33,000.00 1908 Permanent improvements 21,011.48 1909 Permanent improvements 8,840.00 1910 Permanent improvements 6,333.50 1911 Permanent improvements 18,694.00 1912 Permanent improvements 37,139.54 Total $159,371.53 </seg>

Michael Lee of Douglas and Hon. George Jackson of Nuckolls. This building as planned will contain about one acre of floor space on the main floor, also a gallery which can be used for moving picture shows of typical scenes from agriculture and horticulture, exhibit space for mercantile or manufactures, or it could be used for good restaurants, etc., etc. Toilet rooms will be included, and inclines built to ascend to the gallery, which will permit its use for any and all purposes. We wish to impress upon you that this building can only be secured by favorable action by the legislature, and we are firm in our belief that the cause of agiiculture and horticulture will be advanced greatly, if we can secure ultimate success. 901 Purchase of grounds 903 Ladies' comfort building 905 Live stock building 907 Cattle barn 909 Coliseum 911 Grandstand $35,000.00 3,000.00 10,000.00 20,000.00 50,000.00 15,000.00 </seg>

It has been our aim to confine publicity to presenta- tion of the ascertained facts of Nebraska development, and the cordial co-operation of the press is gratifying. At the December, 1911, meeting of the American Association of Fairs and Expositions, held in Chicago, we presented a draft of the measure for the construction by the national government of a one hundred thousand dollar exposition building for every state fair ground in the United States, for which on January 15, 1912, a bill was introduced in the National Congress by Hon. John A. Maguir* of Nebraska as House Roll 18005. At the said meeting of the American Association of Fairs and Expositions they favorably commended the measures of the bill, and a committee was sub- sequently appointed, consisting of W. R. Mellor of Nebraska and J. W. Russwurm of Nashville, Tenn. On April 10, 1912, before the Committee on Agriculture of the House at Washington, appeared with me Mr. J. W. Russwurm of Nashville, Tenn., and Mr. Jos. E. Pogue of Raleigh, N. C, and we presented our claims for favorable consideration of the measure. Sixteen members of the committee were present, and the respectful and considerate hearing granted was highly appreciated by this committee, which has reported favorably as to the measure, and it is now up for action by the full committee.

It has been decided that Organized Agri - culture will give a reception and banquet to Dean Charles Bessey tomorrow night at the Lincoln Hotel, at 6:30 o'clock. The object of this banquet is to show appreciation of a man while he is living — rather than to wait until he is dead. We believe we should show our appreciation of such a man as Dean Bessey during his lifetime, and that is the object of this dinner. The tickets are $1.00. I want to ask you to let me know just as soon as you can if you are going, so that the arrangements can be made to take care of everyone. You can come up and get the tickets from me after we adjourn this afternoon. I hope every man here can arrange to go. I know everyone of you are friends of Dean Bessey and we want this to be a testimonial to his worth. 1 President Haws: We will now listen to. the report of the mium Revision Committee. IMr. Rudge: Your committee on revision of the premium list t yesterday afternoon and again this morning, and made some nges. There are perhaps a number of changes that should be de which have been omitted, but when it comes to the question premium revision or the proper revision to be made, grades, and t sort of thing, we think the Superintendent of the department he man to do it, as he is the man who knows better than anyone i what the grade should be and what changes should be made, find some of the Superintendents did not recommend any changes itever. The first change that we have made is in the admission to the Fair grounds. On page twenty-seven, we recommend that we put 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 in there, "On Sunday after after 2 P. M. — all other days after 5 P. M., 25 cents." If there is any objection to that by anyone present, we will take it up now and thresh it out. These are only the recommendations of your committee, you understand. You are at liberty to make as much fuss about it as you want to. I The next recommendation that we have: on page thirty-three, r Class A, we recommend that you add Junior Champion stal - and mares. That will be no expense to us except for ribbons. §Also on page thirty-eight — lot 7, that you add the pony class, Jt stallion four years old and over," and change the "three years or over," to read "best stallion three years and under four years." tOn the Shetland ponies, to have No. 93, read "three years and sr four," and add "Shetland mare four years and over." We Id also recommend an additional premium under this class, and is for saddle pony; say you make the first premium $5.00, nd $3.00 and third, $2.00, and the fourth and fifth just ribbons, lieve that would bring us some additional entries. tAlso on page thirty-nine, we recommend that you add a lot for i. We did not offer premiums on jacks last year, but I believe a good thing to do so. kYou understand that all these changes are merely recommenda - and that they are subject to change at any time; we just put up to you, and if you want to make any objections to these ;sted changes fire away and do it now. I want to say that the Superintendent of Class "A" in his recommendation for changes to your committee recommended that we put in a class for saddle horses. It has been our experience with saddle horse class in the past that the horses were not kept out at the Fair grounds; that the only entries made were from people who owned saddle horses here in Lincoln, and they kept them in Lincoln; did not keep them out at the Fair grounds at all. Some years ago, we tried having a saddle horse premium, but our experience along that line has not been very satisfactory and so we cut out that class. If anyone has any information along that line which would indicate that we would get any saddle horse entries, if we added that, we would be glad to hear from him. Does anyone know any people outside of Lincoln who would enter their saddle horses? Do you, Mr. Wolcott, outside of the city? I Mr. Wolcott: There is one in Seward that I know of, and 's all. There might be some at other points that would come in e had such a list. Mr. Mbllor: I do not think it would be right to bar out Lincoln entries. I think we should have such classification as that if none but Lincoln owners do enter; but I think we ought to compel them to leave their horses at the grounds — do the same as other people who make entries. If they want to keep their horses down town, then I think they should be barred, but not if they will leave them at the Fair grounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p099">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 99 I Mr. Rudge: We have also been requested to put in a lot for ■es and a lot for Clydesdales. We put in a class for Shires and desdales last year, but quite a number did not think it wise to so this year. Quite a number of the classes were not filled; did have more than one or two horses in them; or, it has been sug - :ed that if we put them in at all this year, that we class them together. On page forty, Class B, under the heading "Be Sure to Reac each Numbered Rule," it has been recommended that we change that to cow two years old or over, and that in the definition of herds we cut out from the graded herd the cow three years old or over That is a rule that has been adopted by the National Association of State Fairs. Then over on page 49, under Dairy Breeds, lot 9, under 43' Jersey bull, make the first premium $10.00, second premium $6.00 third premium $4.00, and fourth premium ribbon, and under 438 make the first premium $10.00, the second $6.00, the third $4.00 and the fourth ribbon. Under 439, make the first premium $10.00 second $6.00, third $4.00, and fourth ribbon. No. 440, first premium $10.00, second $6.00, third $4.00 and fourth $3.00. Under 441, the same as it is at present. Under 445, add a fourth premium at $3.00. Under 446, add a fourth premium of $3.00. The reason that we advise this addition and extension on young animals is to brini in the heifer calf and give them a chance to show. The dairy men have asked for a little more money and I know they are entitled to Then on page 51, Breeding Holsteins, under 478, no change. 480 no change. No. 481, change to read, first premium $12.00, second $8.00, third $6.00, and fourth $4.00. No. 482, change to read first premium $10.00, second $7.00, third $5.00, and fourth The next change to be made is under 485, first premium $15.00, second premium $10.00, third $6.00, and fourth $4.00. No. 486, first premium $15.00, second $10.00, third $6.00, fourth $4.00. No. 487, $10.00, second $7.00, third $5.00, and fourth $3.00. No. 488, first premium $10.00, second $7.00, third $5.00, and fourth $3.00. I On our premium list, under herds, in addition to 496, we have a calf herd which was last year omitted by error — the first prite $20.00, the second $15.00, and third premium $10.00. Now on page 57, we would recommend putting in a Duro Barrow under one year old, and make premiums as follows: the firs $8.09, the second $4.00 and the third $2.00; and on the one yea old, three premiums, the first $10.00, the second $4.00 and the thin $2.00. We have an offer from the National Duroc Breeders' Associa tion to put in a like amount, if we will put in those two, so a man who enters will get double money if he wins. IWe also suggest the addition of a lot for mule footed hogs, if can get three exhibitors. This is a rule that has been adopted </seg>
            <seg id="p100">100 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE by a good many State Fair Associations, that in order to add a class there must be at least three exhibitors. tWe are also going to recommend cutting out lot 6, Tamworths, year as we did not have any entered last year. IWe also have a proposition from the Nebraska Farm Journal ng us to put in this class a prize of $30.00 for boy swinebreeders the rules governing it read as follows: To be eligible to enter the Capper Boys' Pig Contest at the State Fair at Lincoln, the boy must be 20 years of age or under, March 1, 1913. He must own and feed his pig. The pig must be pure bred, eligible to record, the sire and dam being recorded in the proper record association, and be of one of the following breeds: I Poland China, Berkshire, Duroc-Jersey, I. C. Chester White, or mpshire, and farrowed after March 1, 1913, on the home place land. The prize will be $30.00 in cash — $15.00 going to first ird, $10.00 to the second award, and $5.00 to the third. All r of the breeds will compete and the entry may be either a boar or a sow pig. The prizes will be awarded by the regular swine ge or judges of the show. Pigs shown in the regular classes the fairs will be eligible to this class. Boys who intend to enter a pig in the contest are requested to notify Arthur Capper, Omaha, Nebraska. tMR. CROCKER, of the Swinebreeders" Association: I want to just one word in regard to swine at the Fair. As an association are anxious to prevent the spread of hog cholera, and we are ng to make a proposition to hog breeders who exhibit at the that if they will have their swine — if they are willing to have ■ swine inoculated with the serum we will pay for the cost of application — this for the purpose of preventing the spread of cholera or rather hog cholera getting in among the swine that exhibited at the Fair Grounds — of course, it is not compulsory, only applies while hogs are on exhibition at the Fair grounds. I Mr. Rudge: The next change to be made is under Class E — ltry. No, I am wrong there, there's no change recommended er Class E. I We will pass on to Class F — Farm Products. We have a report i William James, Superintendent, and also report from one of judges. These reports are a good deal the same. Mr. James ts to take out some of the articles and put in others that are b adapted to this part of the country. He wants a little more ey for some of the items, but by taking out some of them, it about even it up, so that there will be no material increase in premium list.

That is a Chinese puzzle to a good ly of us. The committee put in a good deal of time on this I believe we have it as near right as scoring on an exhibit can made. Mr. McArole: What is the object in making this difference? tMR. MELLOR: So that the men who live so far away and who g their exhibits such a distance will have some incentive to come will get some where near what the fellows who live nearer to Fair get. As it is now the eastern division gets an average of 1.00, the central division $154.00, and the western division $121.00. ; not fair to the men who come so far to give them so much less i we do the men who live right around here. I think that is l to everybody. We want to get the western fellows to bring * products to the Fair and get enthusiastic over it, and we have to do something to make it an object; they are not going to I exhibits at a dead loss, that's sure. And for that reason, the mittee has. made an effort to equalize it in that way. Mr. McArdle: How is that figured? Secretary Mellor: The central and western fellows get more per point than the eastern but under the handicap of altitude which ranges from 1.000 feet above sea level in the eastern part of the state to 5,000 in the western it is absolutely impossible and unjust that the central and western districts should compete against the eastern as crops suitable to the eastern vary widely in comparison with the central and western. LMr. McArdle: I see how it is now. I was wondering how figured it to make it that much more. t Secretary Mellor: You understand though that even now do not get as much as the man in the eastern part of the state, when figuring that much more per point. They just raised money for the benefit of those exhibitors who come the greater nee. I Mr. Rudge: Now, we will pass on to Class G, Dairy Products, re is no change here, but under this head, the committee suggests I we use the central part of the dairy building to show a model y farm.

            <seg id="p104">104 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Kone, and take up the subject of "Free Attractions." We will from Charlie Mann of Chadron on that subject. CHEERS. Mr. Mann: I am glad to meet you all here tonight. The matter of attractions is one of great importance to County Fair managers, and the matter of what to have and what not to have as free attractions is one of the things that we as Fair managers have to give a good deal of consideration. I would not want to go on record as saying what you need in the way of free attractions in this county or in any of the larger counties. I only know from my experience in Dawes County, and so whatever I say, must be from the point of view of my experience in handling the Dawes County Fair, and I can only talk from the point of what our people like up there, and what are the needs of a small county such as Dawes. I believe though that I can say without boasting, that the Dawes County Fair Association is a live wire. No doubt you all have just as live wires. In fact, I am of the opinion, that in these days, it takes a good live wire to make a county Fair a success in any county in Nebraska. (Cheers). This is a pretty big subject anyway for a little man to handle, and as I said, I can only speak from the point of what we do up in Dawes County; what might be the right thing up there, might not suit at all in the larger counties. I believe ours is one of the oldest County Fair Associations in the state. We have a lot of hard workers in our association, and we make it a study to please the patrons of our Fair. In our associa - tion, we have the boys in line in our district schools; we have them grow and bring in premium potatoes and products which they have planted, tended and grown themselves; we make that a department; a special feature of our Fair. We put the first premium on those at $5.00 and on down to $1.00. We try to have at our Fairs, the best of everything, up to the limit of our ability and financial re - sources. We try to get out of the old rut. We try every year to add something new; something that will attract attention. Every - one of you know that if you have the same old thing, exhibited in the same old way every year, very soon the people are going to get tired of coming, and then your association is soon busted. So you have to keep awake, alive and hustling to get something new every year, or show the old exhibits in a new way, so that you can hold the attention and interest of the patrons; for all you fellows know that we can't run these Fairs very well without patrons (laughter I. I Now, I am going to speak of a delicate subject here, and I tell i that in advance, because some of you fellows are going to laugh &gt; say there goes Charlie Mann and his squaws again, but I don't e. (Laughter). I am going to talk about squaws, because its ood thing and something that you fellows should know about and yourself, may be. When we were searching for something new the way of attractions a couple of years ago, I happened upon </seg>
            <seg id="p105">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 105 I squaw proposition. There was a gang up there — the Sioux an tribe— thirty-five miles from Chadron — and we made appli - &gt;n to the agency to see how we had to go about getting them, first idea was just to have them there as a sort of an attraction xhibit for people to look at; though of course its not very new ee Indians out in western Nebraska; but we were fishing around new attractions and we started out to find out what we could in that line. We found that we could get them and we went and made a selection. We had squaw running races and relay s, and I want to tell you that it was the best thing in the way aces that we have ever had at our Fair and the best drawing [; I was telling Rudge — that it would be mighty good draw - card, in my opinion, for any Fair, even for the State Fair itself. eers). I Then we had the broncho-busters — we had some from Cheyenne, I think they are the best riders in the United States. Out in county, we like riding, racing and broncho busting. The people t seem to get tired of it. I tell you when it comes to relay i, I wouldn't give a cent for a man relay race, and I don't ve the average patron of the Fairs would. They see they mre riders and its good work and all that, but they don't enthuse; you put on a girl relay race, and even if they don't ride half 'ell it attracts and interests the patrons. Our squaw relay races one of the best free attractions we have ever had on our grounds 'hadron. t There is another item I want to mention though perhaps it not exactly come under the head of free attractions, and that we appoint a reception committee and they go around and get ainted with people and introduce them to others and make them at home. This year, there has been a new tribe of Indians transferred to Fort Robinson (laughter) and we are going to try and get them for our Fair, also soldiers, 500 or 600 of them — we have made the appeal direct to Washington and expect to have them. We have had soldiers before camped on the Fair grounds, going through their drills and so on, and we have found it a very good attraction. Now, I said awhile ago, that I believed in races; I do a certain kind of races, but just fancy horse races for a free attraction. I don't. You pay a lot for them, and not more than 15 r ' c , possibly 25 'j, care anything about them. I don't believe so many people care for plain horse races any more. I think the time has come when you must have something different and novel to attract attention and hold it. tNow, my Secretary, or the Secretary of our association is here us tonight, and I believe he knows more of the practical part lis business than I do, and I am going to call on him, if I may, ly a few words after I am through. is difficult for me to talk to you on the subject of free attrac - , or what would be a drawing card for you folks, in counties </seg>
            <seg id="p106">106 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE where you have thickly settled community to draw from. What suits us up in the sand hills would not do down here at all. t There is one other thing that I might mention right here, and is that we don't allow any gambling devices of any sort on Fair grounds. We simply won't have them. We won't allow hing on our grounds that is not straight and honorable; and our le know, when they come to the Dawes County Fair, that they not going to be skinned alive before they can get back home. ighter). I believe that the County Fairs all over the state and State Fair also, will not make any mistake by doing away with I questionable gambling contraptions. I Now, I think we ought to educate the district school boy to ome interested in our Fairs; to contribute his share to the Fairs; grow something and bring in an exhibit; make him feel that its a part of his business, so that he will take an interest in it. Here - tofore it has been turned over to the County Superintendent and has stopped there. I believe we ought to make it our business to see that these school boys are interested; to get them into friendly contests with each other, as to which one can grow and bring in the finest exhibit. I guess before I quit, I'll have to say something about flying machines, for that is one of the big problems of county Fair free attractions. Most of the people think the Fair ought to have a flying man, and it's one of the hardest things that we have to do. It's easy enough to get them to say they'll fly and to get the money to pay them but if there's a cloud anywhere around, it's another matter to get them to fly. We had Walsh of the Curtis outfit one year. He went up 200 feet. We paid him $1,200. He made a good fly. The next year, we had a contract with the same people and they sent a substitute, a fellow by the name of McMillan. Our contract was for $1,200. We advertised that the same man would fly that flew last year, but they sent a substitute. We had to pay the substitute only $1,000.00. He flew on Wednesday twice in the afternoon, and on Thursday twice; he came to me on Saturday and was fussing about the atmosphere and didn't want to go up. I told him it was no fly no pay, and it was his neck not mine. Col. Leonard was there and he knows how they tried to flimflam us. Mr. Leonard: I will swear to anything you say. IMr. Mann: Now about the carnival part of it; I think the nival is all right for Fair week; a good thing, though I don't believe having it on the Fair grounds; but down town. I think a car - al is a good thing for the evenings of Fair week, but I believe having a good clean one. We don't want any hoochie-koochie ices or any of that kind of so-called carnival attractions. We it a good clean show that a man can go to and take his wife 1 daughter, and not be ashamed of himself. I think the experience t we have had in Dawes County will prove the experience of most of you in your own counties, and that since we have cut </seg>
            <seg id="p107">proceedings Nebraska state board of agriculture 107 tall these questionable attractions — since we have discarded every - l of that nature and character, we have got one of the beat , one of the most successful Fairs from every point of view in part of the state. Most of us measure success by the gate pts, and ours has increased since we did away with all the bling devices and fakes of every description. » There is another point that I might bring up here, and that it, just as soon as our Fair closes one year and we have our annual ing, we begin right then to plan and get ready for the next &gt; meeting. We study it and plan a year in advance what we have, the proper thing and so on. I was talking with the Chair - of our Sports Committee the other day, and I told him I thought fall we'd better have some more squaw relay races. (Laughter;, can laugh, but it's the best drawing card we've ever had. Those are married, too. It's a good thing. Col. Leonard was up there saw our squaw relay races and he can tell you how it took with people. Col. Leonard: It was great all right Cheers and laughter. I Mr. Mann: Now I am going to take the liberty of calling Mr. Snow, the Secretary of our Dawes County Association, ink you. Cheers. I Mr. Snow: I think Mr. Mann has done very well indeed for hwestern Nebraska. I think he has entertained the people er than I ever could. I want to tell you gentlemen, that Charlie in is one of the biggest Fair promoters that we have in the state, slieve also that he is the oldest Fair promoter in the State of raska. He has been President of the Dawes County Fair Asso - on ever since it started. He is always on the job. He knows nuch about the county as any man in the state, and he knows y man in our county by his first name. And it is not only in hwestern Nebraska that he is known; he is known and recog - d all over the state. A Member: I don't wonder that Charlie called on his Secretary to speak. (Laughter). »Mr. Snow: That's all right gentlemen. What I am saying about Mann, is what every man in our part of the country thinks says. You people down here in the eastern part of the state have a good deal to brag about; you have a good many attractions, but I noticed over at the exhibit at the auditorium the other day, when it came to the apple exhibit, that the best one in the show was from our part of the state. Kwant to tell you people that I have lived out in the State of ington, where they make a business of apple growing, and I have some fine ones exhibited out there, but I never saw a finer ,t from Washington, or any other state in the Union, than I </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 saw at the auditorium yesterday from the great State of Nebraska. (Cheers.) I want to tell you that up in northwestern Nebraska, there are three counties of which we are all mighty proud and the products of which are known all over the country. These are Dawes, Sioux, and Sheridan Counties. These three counties have three products that are known all over the world; the first is the potatoes that come from Sheridan County — that is the best potato county in the state. You will find the finest potatoes grown in Sheridan County that you ever saw in your life; the finest, the best and the most of them; and in Dawes County, the home of Charlie Mann, you will find better alfalfa raised than in any other county in the state. Our alfalfa will test 99% pure. Our alfalfa, first grade will bring $18.00 per bushel, second grade $12.00 per bushel. Now, when you come to Sioux County, I mention its steers. The best steers sold on the Omaha market last fall were steers from Sioux County. Three things gentlemen, three necessary things, potatoes, alfalfa, cattle, the best grown anywhere in the country are grown in the three counties in northwestern Nebraska. You can't touch northwestern Nebraska on those three products. Col. Leonard: I said that I would swear to anything Charlie Mann said, and so I suppose I have got to subscribe to all that Mr. Snow said, too. You know when you go to Dawes County and go to see Charlie Mann, the first thing he tells you about is his squaws and after he gets through ranting around about what a fine propo - sition they are, then he right away asks you, "Have you seen my Secretary, Mr. Snow?" And then when he gets through telling you about the squaws and Secretary Snow, he starts in to tell you what good Fair they have in Dawes County. But gentlemen, joking aside, we laugh at Brother Mann and his squaws, but I want to say to you that I took in the Dawes County Fair and it is a good one — one of the best in the state, and while the Fair is going on Charlie Mann is here, there and every - where. He's the big moving feature of the Fair. I don't know whether the squaws would create as big a stir at some of your fairs as they do in Dawes County or not; but I do know they are a drawing card up there, and that every word Mr. Mann said about the success of his fair is true. Toastmaster Wilson: Are there any other remarks upon free attractions? If not, we will pass on and listen to Alfred Pont, of Stanton, upon "Concessions." Mr. Pont. Mr. Pont: I don't at all understand why I was selected for this subject. This is the first time I have ever been at a meeting of this kind, and I don't know what I ever said or did that would lead anyone to believe that I was competent to talk upon the sub - ject of concessions. It requires a good deal of courage to stand up and talk when I look into some of the faces that are before me, you men who have bad twenty-five years experience in running county fairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p109">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 109 I might start out by saying in regard to the gambling conces - sion, that the county fairs generally all over the state are not grant - ing such concessions any more. It has been said that they were drawing cards. They were, literally, they drew the money from the pockets of the crowd. (Cheers.) These concessions have gradually been done away with, and the patrons of the fairs do not seem to miss them much. One of my main objections is, that they take up room on the grounds that should, legitimately, be given to the dis - playing of agricultural products — the products of the farm, which was the original intent and idea of the county fair association. Every year the county fairs in this state are getting cleaner and better and farther away from fake concessions; as, for instance, the fake jewelry fellow, who pays you $5.00 or $10.00 a day for the privilege of coming in and bleeding the patrons of your fairs. (Cries of "That's right.") There is nothing attractive about his display and it is of no benefit to anybody, except to leave the victim poorer, and we hope wiser. But there is another one that in my opinion is just about as bad, and as badly managed, and that no fair association seems yet to have found a solution for, and that is the food concession — the transient fellow, the man who comes in with his wagon and makes sandwiches and hamburger steak. I am one county fair man who is against this fellow. He is a disgrace to the county fair and his food not fit for a hog. I believe that the time is not far distant when this food concession will be seriously considered, and this dirty fellow who comes around and buys the privilege to dispense hamburger and hot wienies will be done away with. I believe it would be to our interest to take this matter in hand ourselves and handle that concession by hiring competent people who will provide decent food, coffee that is fit to drink and clean bread and butter and clean well cooked meat, and at the same time make a profit ourselves. I believe it is the duty of the county fair associa - tions to provide for everybody and for the comfort of everyone and to protect all who come within their gates. It is the patrons of our fairs upon whom we depend for our success. They are entitled to this. I don't believe that the county fair association could do anything that would make a better impression with the patrons than to improve the food concession; not necessarily give them fancy food, but something fit to eat. (Cheers) As manager of a ball team for eight years, I have attended most of the fairs held in northeastern Nebraska during that period. And I have been able to judge, to some extent, what concessions please the patrons and what ones do not; and while I think the ball team concession is allright, still it does not help in the work and object for which county fairs were organized. There are a great many things that people think amuse them, that are to their detriment in the long run. I want to go on record at this meeting as saying that </seg>
            <seg id="p110">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 110 there is not a concession that I know of at the present time that I would recommend to the county fair associations of the State of Nebraska, as being worth going out and hustling for. I don't think any of them are any good. (Cheers). Toastmaster Wilson:' We ought to have some good lively discussion on thu subject. I would like some information on it myself. That's what we are here for — to tell our experiences and try to be of benefit one to the other. Let's hear from a number of you on this subject of concessions. It is of great importance to county fair managers. (Cries of " McArdle, McArdle." Toastmaster Wilson: McArdle of Douglas is called for. KU Wilson: There has been a good deal said here about live but what about Douglas County? Haven't they any live &gt; there? (Laughter.) Mr. McArdle: Douglas is silent for once. We only have Ak-Sar-Ben in Douglas County. Mr. Wilson: The one thing that comes to my mind is, that we should adopt some system in this matter of concessions, some plan whereby when we get a good concession we can send it on to the next fair that holds the week following ours and so on in a circuit, and only have something that amounts to something; in that way, we could get a better class of concessions and for less money, as we could promise them not only a one-week engagement, but several weeks consecutively. We ought to have some sort of booking bureau ■ something of that kind to handle this matter; have districts, something along that line. Another thing we ought to do is to seek some means whereby fair association can protect another against the dead ones. re's no one of us but what has been beat by a fakir. Now what ought to do is to pass that information along, so that our brother in the next county will not get caught by the same people. We could have a grievance committee or something of that sort, to whom we could report these things and they would see that the other fair managers were put in possession of the information so that they could be looking out. I believe this is a subject that we should take up and discuss at this meeting. Mr. McArdle: I suppose I will have to say a word for Douglas County. I don't feel good. I am quite angry. Rudge just sprung that old one on me about the match that lit, and I fell for it. I don't like to have a man have anything on me. But there's a good time coming. I don't know very much about concessions. In Douglas County, we have the Ak-Sar-Ben, and the Douglas County Fair is just a side issue. The Ak-Sar-Ben handle the concessions, and the concessions bring in the money. There's a combination of dog and tail, the Ak-Sar-Ben is the dog and the Douglas County Fair Association is the tail, so you fellows all know what we get. So I have forgotten what I did know in the past about concessions — from that time away back in the past when the Douglas County </seg>
            <seg id="p111">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 111 Agricultural Society was able to run its own business. There was a time when Douglas had a fair and I was connected with it, and about all the experience I had then with concessions, was to get them, and then Hy. Myers got the money. I don't know anything about concessions, but I am strong on attractions, as strong as any man unless it is Charlie Mann. (Laughter.) He has an attraction up there that I believe would be appropriate for Douglas. I would like to put him wise to this though, that he don't want to let us get them down in Douglas County. He wants to hang on to that attraction like grim death to a sick nigger, or the first thing he knows, he won't have that drawing card up in Dawes. You remember how he unintentionally let it fall that the squaws were the main attraction he had up there. If I have any friends here who have any influence with Charlie Mann, I would appreciate it if they would help me get this attrac - tion for Douglas. I think the Ak-Sar-Ben could use a number of attractions of this same kind. To astm aster Wilson: Anything further on the subject under discussion? We ought to have some good suggestions brought out under this head. If there is nothing, we will pass on and listen to J. C. Dort, of Pawnee, on "What the Patrons Demand." Mr. Leonard: Mr. Dort is not here, but we have a big man on that subject. Frank Howard is with us. Call on him. TOASTMASTER WILSON: Mr in front Mr. Howard please. Howard is called for. Come up TO ASTM ASTER WlLSON: Mr. call upon Mr. Wood of Gering Patrons Demand." Howard is not here now. We will to open this subject, "What the Mr. Wood: I don't know very much about the subject, but I know that we are all in the business to get the gate receipts, and in order to get them, you have got to have what the people demand; you have got to get what will please the patrons. Now, the object and aim of the county fair is to make a display of agricultural exhibits, live stock exhibits and so on, but in my opinion, 97 to 99% of the people who pay their money to get through the gates at our fairs demand amusement; they go there to be amused, not to be instructed, and my opinion is based on twelve to fifteen years experience with county fairs out in the western part of the state. I think it was something like seven or eight years ago with our fair out in Scotts Bluffs County that the idea began to creep in that it was necessary for us to have some attractions — that we had to import some amusement to satisfy the people. The fair had been held for some thirteen years before that and it had been an agricultural and live stock exhibition mostly. They were only getting a handful of people and not making a nickle. By that time, the idea was becoming general with fair men, that attractions were what the people wanted. I think it was about seven or eight years </seg>
            <seg id="p112">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 112 ago, we had a balloon ascension, which cost us $100.00, and the last two years we have had an aeroplane. We have now grown into an association, and only since then have we realized that the people demand amusement; that we must have it, if we want to get their money at our gates. We have prospered since this realization. We now have a number of good buildings, gocd grounds, a surplus in our treasury, and I ascribe it all to the fact that we have catered to amusements for the people. When I say amusements I mean the general class of amusements. The aeroplane was a good drawing card; and it will be for some time yet. The people always like to see a flying machine. Three years ago, we sent north to Charlie Mann's territory and brought down thirty-five or forty squaws. One year, we had an expert come out from Chicago and give us fireworks in the evening and it made quite an impression. Up to this time, we have never carried any carnival features inside the fair grounds. Now, as to racing. I believe in racing. I think it's a good thing and people like it. But I don't believe the people demand large purses and fancy horses. I believe that races which do not cost very much are just as satisfactory. You can put up two purses, $10. °0 and $15.00 for a saddle race and it will be just as satisfactory as if you had invested $150.00 or $200.00 and imported some fine horses. Personally, I am not strong for races, but I think the people like them, and it is one of the things that two-thirds of the patrons de ire; but I believe that iff a mistake to put up a great big bunch of money for racing. I think a good plan is to get local horses and drivers and riders if possible. The people take an interest in a horse or a driver they know; and you can always get them cheaper than you can to bring them in from the outside. Another matter that I might speak of, that to my mind is of the greatest importance, and that is to keep your promises with your patrons. Give them just exactly what you promise them. I know there are times when it is not possible; you are not always able to do it, but as near as you can, give them just exactly what you tell them you will give them. You will find that it pays in the long run. Don't advertise that you will have a certain attraction at the fair and then when the people come, fall down on it. Keep faith with them just as far as you can. I recall a year or so ago down in Custer County. That is Emerson Purcell's County; They had a circus at Broken Bow, and we thought it would be a great thing to have it at our fair. We got hold of the managers by wire; they agreed to come and we advertised it fully; they fell down on us just a few days before the date advertised for the circus, but instead of letting it go and explain later, we got out posters and sent men to every part of the county to announce that the circus would not be there as advertised. We urged them to come and told them what we would have, but we told them that we were unable to have the circus. It did not hurt us half as much as if we had let the matter go and the people had </seg>
            <seg id="p113">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 113 been caught the first day. They would then have advised their friends that we did not have the circus which we had advertised, and that would probably have hurt our attendance for the balance of the week. We played fair with them and they came to our fair just the same. So it is a good business proposition to say nothing of being honest and fair to our patrons. I don't know that I can suggest anything else whereby any improvements can be made. I don't know that I can add anything else to the subject, of "What the Patrons Demand." My experience has all been in the little counties out in the western part of the state. I thank you. (Applause.) Toastm aster Wilson: This subject is one that should bring out considerable discussion. We would like to hear from someone else on this subject. I have enjoyed what has been said; and I believe there are others who might have had a different experience and should have something to add to what has already been said on "What the Patrons Demand." Don't all talk at once now. It has been suggested that Senator Cordeal whom we have with us tonight, tell us something — give us his ideas — some suggestions on "What the Patrons Demand." Senator Cordeal: This is unexpected. I came here to listen and did not expect to be called upon, and I feel that I know very little about the subject; however, I have in the course of politics, attended a good many county fairs, and I can speak from the point of view of one who has attended these fairs and not had anything to do with the management of them. In the course of my cam - paigning over the state, I have, in the last few years, had occasion to visit a number of fairs, and I may say that I believe I know something of what the patrons demand, or about what the people who attend these fairs want. Of course out in our part of the country, we don't take in the amount of money at our fairs that you do in this section and necessarily the amount that we have to spend upon attractions is limited. Our gate receipts are not very large. While the exhibits bring a certain class of people, still I believe the attractions bring more, and I mean by that just the ordinary features, the ordinary attractions. I have no doubt that the aeroplane and the balloon and other more expensive features bring more in proportion, but as I say out our way we cannot afford to get those bigger and more expensive attractions, as we live in a sparsely settled community. I guess I should not have men - tioned balloons; balloons are out of date; the flying machine is the thing now. I don't think there is a county fair in my senatorial district that has been able to have a flying machine yet, but we had the opportunity of seeing one at our State Fair, and no doubt we will be able to have one at some of our county fairs before long — we have had short crops the last few years out that way. I attended the county fair last year at Imperial, and I want to </seg>

They had a good band, the McCook band, and I have a per - al interest in it on that account. They played often and played 1 and the people enjoyed the music. Then they had some wild it features, such as are usually offered at county fairs. They re everyone good attention; had a good place where the patrons ild get a nice lunch, and I think had as many and as good attrac - ns as are usually offered at these fairs. My experience along this line has been very limited, so I feel I should not take up much of your time. I thank you. (Cheers.) To astm aster Wilson: Any further remarks on this subject? Senator Smith from Seward is called for. Senator Smith. 1 Senator Smith: I beg to be excused. Let someone talk who ws more about it than I do. I want to listen. Excuse me, please. Toastm aster Wilson: I guess we will have to let the Senator off. From the way Haws has been nudging me and whispering, I take it that he has something to say about what the patrons demand. I hope he has after all the fuss he has been making, so we will give him a chance now to talk a little. Mr. Haws: I have been very much interested and entertained so far this evening. We have had some very live discussions. The subjects are all good. I have listened with great pleasure to my friend Charlie Mann. I think he is up on the squaw line and more qualified to speak on that subject than any man I know of. And we have heard from Secretary Snow, whom Charlie has privately informed me is the secret of the success of Dawes County Fair, and I take it from what he said that he thinks well of the north - western part of Nebraska. Referring to previous talks, I think every discussion on every subject should have been longer; that more should have been brought out on every subject. These are of very great importance to the county fair man, and this is the time and place to bring them up and give them proper attention. We ought to talk more freely about these matters. If we have troubles, this is the place to discuss them, and let every man help the other to solve the problems. If we have been successful, this is the time and place to tell what has contributed to that success. We want to make the county fairs all over the state better; that is one of the chief purposes of this meeting. We want to get together and find a solution of our troubles, and find out what attractions are better, what ones take better, what ones pay better; and we are all interested in the revenue when it comes down to that. I It is also true that we have to use a good deal of judgment in selecting of our concessions. County fairs have progressed along h other things in the state, and we have to handle them with re judgment and care than we once did. Some years ago — I know my county, and I guess that is true of the most of the counties the state it was largely true that the concessions consisted chiefly </seg>
            <seg id="p115">115 of gambling propositions. I don't know why it was, unless it was because the largest part of the revenue came from that department. Anyway, it was chiefly gambling in those days in our county, and I guess the same condition prevailed all over the state. In those days that was practically all there was to make the fair go; but the people of the state are waking up to the fact now, that a fair means something besides a place to go and gamble, and take a chance on this thing and that thing and lose your money. We are coming to look at the county fair as an educational proposition. It is something that will benefit every individual in the county and in the state in which these fairs are held, and they are now willing to put up money to help defray the expenses. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to have some sort of a gambling proposition at our county fairs. II know of no county fair, and I attended a good many this , where any gambling was allowed in any shape or form; and ile this is true, no matter how close the management watche fair, and how much they are determined to cut out "skin games they call them, they will creep in to some extent no matter how se you watch it. The gambling fraternity are a wily, clever bunc fellows. They will come to you and tell you that this is perfectl itimate, and it will look legitimate, and it is legitimate if yo tch them closely enough, and keep your eye on them all the time t the management can't detail a man to watch them from th le they set up on the grounds until the fair closes; and as soo you take your eyes off from them, the game changes and the robbing the count y boy. I am prepared to say that th inty fair managers are determined to cut out all of that sort o called amusement. This is one of the big problems that confron inty fair managers. Another problem is the matter of the proper amusements, the proper free attractions — what we ought to have and what we will have to pay for them. I have been connected with eight different county fairs this past year, and have created a sort of circuit for the handling of free attractions, passing them on from one town to another. You can get a much more satisfactory contract with the people, and you can also be sure of your people in that way; sure they will come, and sure they will be on the ground when you need them. You can outline a program whereby you can get a string of horses and take them down the line from one fair to another. This gives each fair a better class of horses and more entries, and you can have a more successful race meeting than if each associa - tion acts independently. I think as has been suggested here tonight that we might advantageously make some such arrange - ment whereby we could handle these free attractions through some sort of a bureau, thereby getting cheaper and also better attractions. Naturally, you can get better people if you can figure with them on five, six or eight meetings, instead of one. Now, this is a feature </seg>
            <seg id="p116">116 that all the fair managers should look into and hit upon some such plan. It will prove a good thing for everybody concerned. First, determine how much you can put in, make your classes uniform, and you can get attractions that will stay by you. It is, however, of great importance that the purses and classes be uniform. If one fair puts up a $300.00 purse for a race and another only $150.00, naturally there is going to be some dissatisfaction. And if your fair is paying $150.00 for a certain class and the one over here is paying $200.00 and one over here $300.00, the man is going to jump from the $300.00 over to the $200.00 or $300.00 and leave the $150.00 out. You have simply got to have your purses uniform. Decide what is fair and right, and then everybody stick to it. Now, comes the question, what shall you pay? My experience has taught me that it is possible for county fairs to put too much money into races. In our circuit we used to put $2,400.00 each year in purses. I think possibly that is too much. Some towns think that $300.00 is little enough. I am of the opinion that $200.00 is about right. I think they might make a uniform purse of $200.00 and stick to it. It used to be that they had $300.00 in the north and $200.00 in the south. One or two fairs cut the amount down but they suffered by doing so; and some of them have gone in the hole the last few years. They have been bad years anyway for county fairs — rain and bad weather. Good weather is something that we simply must have in order to make our fairs a success, and that is something that we can never bank upon. About races: we have come to the conclusion that we should put up two good harness races a day for $300.00 and then some running races and saddle races. Now, I believe that it is better to have some of your races made by your own people; it creates an interest they don't feel in the outsider; and even if the work is not as pretty or done as well, they like it better. Put on some relay races — trot a half mile and run a half mile. I believe County Fair Associations of State of Nebraska would find it to their interest to try this, and at the same time it will give just as good satisfaction as though you had three or four high priced races. There is another feature and a mighty important one that has been touched upon here tonight, and that is honesty in advertising. I Advertise what you are going to have; tell the truth about it [ give them exactly what you tell them. Don't put out any big rk bills advertising certain attractions if there is any doubt about ir ability to secure same. Above all things you must get and p the confidence of the people if you make a success of your s. If you have advertised an attraction and they should fall m on you at the last minute, as they often do, tell the people iut it; get out and distribute bills making a plain statement of facts. You may lose money at that particular time on account the non-appearance of the attraction, but this policy will win in long run. It pays to be honest with the people. </seg>
            <seg id="p117">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 117 My experience with county fairs this past year has been a sad one. Never in my life have I suffered and sweat as I did this last year in county fair time. I had 7,000 people at my back demanding that the airship go up and I had nothing to say to them. Through my connection with the State Board of Agriculture (and I thought I was fortunate), I made a contract with the same people who were at the State Fair for aeroplane flights. The man was not at work until Wednesday, although in the contract, I specified that he should be on the ground on Monday. I was determined that I would not disappoint the people and would not take any chances on him getting in at the last minute, so I specified that he must be on the grounds on Monday. He came Sunday night. On Monday he took the machine out. Everything was working good. I congratulated my - self. I thought everything was going fine. That was the only number on the program that I had felt the least leery about and with that going all right everything was fine. Wednesday came, and it was one of the most beautiful days I have ever seen. There was not a breath of air stirring — a perfect day. But my troubles were just to begin. The/man was down in bed at the hotel, claiming to be sick. We went up there; he would not come out; he claimed he was sick. It was easy enough to see there was nothing the matter with him. I begged and I plead with him. He would not stir. Finally, some of my friends slipped him some extra money; then he came down. We were to have three flights that day during the afternoon. I said to him, when he got there, "If you will give us one good flight at 3:00 o'clock, I will be satisfied." I was up against it and I had to make terms. He said that he would go in thirty minutes. I announced it to the crowd. The thirty minutes was up; he rolled the machine out on the ground. He stalled around there for another thirty minutes, and then discovered that he had no gasoline. They had to go two miles to get gasoline. They got the gasoline and put it in the machine, and the fellow came out and said, "My God, take that gasoline out; that won't do; it will ruin everything." They drained the gasoline out, stalling all the time. The crowd was beginning to holler and call "fake, fake." I -vas getting desperate. The people were getting more and more impatient and louder in their cries of fake. At ten minutes of 6:00 o'clock, I said to him, "Do you intend to go up or do you not?" There were 1,000 or 1,200 people yelling their heads off. The tension was terrible. He said, to me, "The wind is too strong, Mr. Haws." I said, "Bless your soul, boy, you have lost your nerve, there is not a breath of wind." I told him that if he did not go up, I would cancel the contract; he said he would go up, if I would keep the crowd back. I said, " No sir, take your own chances. It is not my fault that you have fooled around all afternoon until the crowd are enraged; you can take your own chances with them. If they break your machine and tear it to pieces it's your lookout; it makes no difference to me," and with that I started off. He called me back, </seg>
            <seg id="p118">118 J J\^J^ P( * *V?

I said " No sir, I will do nothing with that rd." I had a suspicion that he wanted to get over to the other of the grounds and jump in his automobile and go to town, he was up against it, he finally got into the machine and made ieautiful flight, but it was 6:00 o'clock and after, and 50 per cent the people had left the grounds in disgust. They censured the nagement because that airship did not go up. I was moving ven and earth to persuade him to make the ascent, and yet we the blame for all the delay. My advice to managers of county associations is to keep away from aeroplanes as an attraction. ould not give ten cents apiece for all the airships in the country, sy're a good thing if the men will go up, but there is absolutely hing dependable about them. tl don't think the management of either the State Fair Associa - i or the county fair associations can spend too much money on -actions. The people come to see the exhibits and they are •rested, but they also come to be amused and they want amuse - its. The people want good clean amusements, free from gambling fakism of any sort. That is what your patrons want, and I eve if you give them that, they will commend you for it. If i give them good clean attractions, honest advertising and cour - ts treatment when they get to the fair, your fair will be a success, hank you. (Cheers.) I Mr. Riesen: In addition to what has been said, I would like add this: I think on this aeroplane business that when one of gets stung we should pass along the name of those people so that others may be warned and be on the lookout for that same cern. I want to say that Gage County was up against the same lg with the International Aviator Company, and I believe the ne should be given out here at this meeting, as it seems they are ng the same thing right along. I Mr. Wilson: We will now have the pleasure of listening to discussion on "Competent Judging" which is a most important rt of the County Fair business. We will hear first from Mr. ink G. Odell. Mr. Odell: Mr. Young was to open the discussion, but I have some very definite ideas on the subject. I am not averse to being called upon, and in fact, to be quite frank, I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this subject. I In the first place, I quite agree with the gentlemen who think t attractions are necessary at the county fairs. The county fair the people's holiday. It has been so from time immemorial, n't imagine that these excellent fairs which you are now holding every county in the State of Nebraska are one of the modern :itutions. Away back in the mediaeval times, in Germany and ngary, there were festivals, the autumn festivals of the people — holiday of the people — the time for celebrating the harvesting </seg>
            <seg id="p119">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 119 i crops; they brought in their produce and their stock, they had ir bands and their decorated streets and their holiday time. You , find a most interesting and delightful literature in the history these old fairs. This literature is easily accessible and could be d with pleasure and profit by those who are interested in the nty fair as an institution. It is interesting to read of the evolu - 1 of the county fair from the early day down until the present. is now as it was then, the people's holiday, but it is also to my id, one of the best and greatest opportunities for education. I know that there has been a good deal of fun poked at your capable and efficient State Fair Secretary here, because he has claimed that the State Fair of Nebraska was a great educational institution. I assert that he is right. I say that in no place in Nebraska can so much education be gathered in so short a space of time, so much of an educational value, as at our annual State Fair. I assert that at no other place can so much valuable information be obtained as to the resources of the county and of the state, as at the State Fair here in Lincoln. There is no place within the broad domain of this commonwealth, where so much of real education can be obtained by the average citizen, within the space of five days, as out here on our Fair grounds. I might go a step further and say — having visited fairs in every state in the United States — that in no place in the United States can so much education of real value, real prac - tical value, be gathered in so short a space of time, as during the five days of our State Fair in Lincoln. (Cheers.) But now, what of this matter of competent judging? In the first place, everybody will agree without any preliminaries, that competent judging means that the products will be carefully scored that the lesson may be taught to make better exhibits next year Then the exhibit should be carefully selected with an eye to uni formity, and the exhibitor should be taught the great value of uni formity. I went over to the Iowa State Fair and watched the judgini there. They had a splendid exhibition and they were doing the mos careful judging; I noticed one remarkable thing, and that was, tha it was not always the man who had the biggest ear of corn, or the biggest radish, or the biggest potato, who won premiums. I noticec one exhibitor there — a grizzled old farmer, and every time he cam before the judge it was with a product that was the most uniform the most perfect in its development and in perfect show condition that was the one that the tag went on, nine times out of ten. At the speakers' table tonight, sits a man who was one of th judges at the Bee exhibit, and I remember that our former Superin tendent out at the ground, used to get annoyed and exasperated a me because I would stay out there until two or three o'clock i the morning, the night before the Fair opened, sand' papering am fixing my exhibit. He said to me one night, "Odell, for the Lord' sake, aren't you ever going to get through?" I said, "I don' </seg>
            <seg id="p120">120 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fv whether I am or not, but I am going to stay here until I l them in proper condition for the exhibit. I am going to give judges the best that I have." And when the checks came from Secretary's office, it proved that I had. (Cheers.) You want to teach your individual exhibitor the value of uni - formity, but you want to be able to tell him why these things are so. They are teaching the boys something in the contests that have been held in the schools this fall in the various states. They are teaching the boys to select their seed potatoes from the hills that have the most potatoes in them; to know the parentage of his seed potatoes before he puts them into the ground; not to plant any old kind of potatoes which have an eye on them, but to select his seed from the hills that have 7 to '9 perfect potatoes. Then when the seed is put into the ground, the next harvest will show from 7 to 9 potatoes in every hill. They will reproduce themselves. If you plant runts, you will grow runts. If you plant potatoes that are few in the hill, yo &gt; will have hills with but few in them. That is what we want to teach the boys in our state. (Cheers.) tThe State of Oregon has made progress along that line. When as out there at their State Fair, I went to the Superintendent Public Instruction and talked with him as to how they had rested the boys in the matter of individual growing of products, took me down and showed me a small amphitheatre and me an interesting story about that building. He told how it 1 to be a beer saloon, and now it had been abandoned for that pose and turned into a home for exhibits, a place to house exhibits I came from the country schools of Oregon. He said that they had organized a potato growing contest among the boys and girls in the rural schools of Oregon. I told him we raised some potatoes in the State of Nebraska. He said, "Come with me and I will show you potatoes raised by these boys and girls." He showed me those potatoes. There were hundreds of potato exhibits and I stopped to examine them but Superintendent Alder - man pulled me away saying: "Come on over here until I show you some potatoes." He led me to an exhibit made by a thirteen - year old boy, the product of a single seed potato having thirteen eyes. After looking it over I made up my mind that so far as boys and potatoes are concerned, the superstition concerning the number thirteen was exploded. There were twelve boxes of these potatoes, a bushel in a box, beginning with the best and biggest and most uniform, and getting down to potatoes of about the size that you buy on the market here; I was amazed when he told me that those twelve bushels of potatoes had been grown by this boy thirteen years old, raised from a single seed potato in one brief summer. I could not believe it. I said, " Go tell that to somebody else," but he went on to say, "Somebody had told that boy that potatoes have a continuous growth; that if he would plant them in a hot bed until they sprouted and then break the sprouts off, they </seg>
            <seg id="p121">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 121 would grow more. He did it, and kept on breaking them off and growing more and more. He kept on growing the sprouts and breaking them off until he had enough to plant 200 hills, and from those 200 hills, he raised this twelve bushels of potatoes that I saw there And they talk about the age of miracles being past!" (Cheers.) I had learned something, gentlemen. I had learned something of value from a thirteen year old country boy; learned what it was possible for us to do among the school boys of our state; get them interested, get them to doing things, and have them bring their products to the county fair to be scored by experts. I Now, the question as to how we can get this system of uniform, ipetent judging, is not only on individual exhibits; but I regard it great value that we maintain a high standard of judging at the nty fair, upon everything exhibited there. I think the State of Nebraska has the best State Fair in the United States, and I am very sure that it has the best agricultural exhibit of any fair in the United States, but we will not continue to maintain this high standard unless we keep in line with the march of progress and continue to learn from the other states, and to pro - gress as we go along. A short while ago, I was at Salt Lake City, and they had an exhibit there from a fourteen year old boy who had grown 794 bushels of potatoes on a single acre of ground. I tell you gentle - men, that with all the progress we have made, some of the states in the northwest can teach us things, and things that we should be only too willing to learn. I The question is, "how?" Well, as I see it, we have a great fiel( usefulness — a greater field of usefulness in Nebraska — than in an er state in the union, and that great field is the University — department of agriculture of the State University. They wi •don me if I take the liberty of giving my definition of what versity should be. I have reached that point of independenc ere all university men look alike to me, and the only differenc an see in their relation to the people is by the degree of servic ich they give back to the people of the state, in return for th ney which they are paid for their services. (Cheers.) II am not going to depreciate in any way the value of the public &gt;ol, the public school training, or the college education; but, my nds, I am thinking of the boys and girls back yonder, out here over there, who are never going to be able to set their faces de of that university. Those hundreds and thousands of boys girls who will not be able to keep in school beyond the fifth, h, seventh and eighth grades; who are never going to high school to college; it is of those boys and girls I am thinking tonight, of what our duty is to them, and of what the duty of the versity of Nebraska is towards them. I want to see those boys I girls better fitted for the battle of life. They need some of </seg>
            <seg id="p122">122 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tse things which we have been training university experts to teach those more fortunate ones who can come to the university. tl think we ought to formulate some plan whereby we would to the University, "You are to furnish us competent judges, that we can send them out to the county fairs to judge the pro - its of those boys and girls who cannot get to the University, but ) are doing as much for the uplift and the upbuilding of Nebraska, anyone within the state." (Cheers.) tl believe that it is plainly our duty and plainly the duty of the iversity to make it possible to elevate the standard of this part the State of Nebraska; to send out to those people what they not come after. I believe that should be within the scope of meaning of the Extension Department of the Nebraska State iversity. (Cheers.) tl do not believe you should go to the farms to get the judges these county fair exhibits; but that we should send out experts, e who know what quality is; who look farther than the amount the size. I believe we should send out men to help them in their ;ing, to get them interested in better growing, better cultivating, er products. That, in my belief, is the meaning of the Univer - and that the University is for the million and a quarter who never go to it, as much as for the 4,000 who can. (Cheers.) This is no censure of the University or criticism on its past policy. The University is doing things and doing them rapidly. The chancellor, the faculty, the regents, every one of them are doing great things for the State of Nebraska. That wonderful meeting that you had at Minden, Mr. Haws, where you fed 2,000 at a single meal at noon, shows the progress, the interest that is taken. We want things so that the people who cannot come to the University can have the University brought to them (cheers) and we are all coming to see it that way. It is only necessary to ask the Univer - sity and they would do it, but they have no money. You must go to the legislature for funds for your extension department, so that these men can be sent out. We all know the work they are doing out at the State Farm, with reference to the development of better products, and we want to connect up that work with the results which are exhibited at the county fairs in every county in the state, in the fall. We want that work to show there. It should show there. That is the meaning and intention of the State Farm. tl thank you very much for calling upon me this evening and ng me this opportunity to say very plainly and very frankly things which I have in my heart. I have long felt that those pie whom circumstances make it impossible to attend the Uni - lity, yet who have a right to it, and a right to its benefits, uld have some of the benefits taken to them through some plan ch should be adopted; because whenever you raise the standard farming, the standard of producing, you raise the standard of </seg>
            <seg id="p123">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 123 living, and your University has accomplished the purpose for which it was intended. There is only one out of every 410 of our boys and girls upon the farm in this state who will ever go through the hig school under the present conditions and under our present system of education; and only one in every 820 of our boys and girls upon the farms who are ever going to get inside of a college and matricu late under our present system of education. In all, but one in 6,500 of our 185,000 boys and girls on the farms, will ever get course of agricultural education in our colleges, and yet our percent age is as high I think, as any state in the Union; but through th mis-application of our system of education, of the more than 12,000,00 of boys and girls upon the farms, we are told that but two-fifth of them will get beyond the fifth grade in the country school, unless the present system is changed. »At present, in my opinion, the greatest factor that we have for iging this education home to them, is the county fair. We can Ice this an active agency for social uplift, ' just as they are doing Oregon and Utah. I saw something when I was out there in Oregon that caused rs of joy to stream down my cheeks. I saw in a great tent an libit of eugenics and child welfare, with trained nurses in charge, rsicians from Portland, Seattle and San Francisco. Mothers and hers brought their babies to have their heads measured and read; ents were told of any physical defects the babies may have and at to do to remedy them; they tell them how to rear the child insure its perfect development. I tell you it's a great thing— this ing care of the babies, looking out for their future in a scientific way. I Here we have our Pure Breeders' Live Stock Association and and that, and we take care of the development of our live stock, it never seems to have occurred to us to do anything for our es to raise them up to good citizenship. (Cheers.) II went to the annual banquet of the Live Stock Breeders Associa i. Anyone who raises a chicken, a pony, or a collie dog is eligibl membership in that organization. They all get together and tal ut how to breed better live stock. I heard them discuss how raise a better bull, a better cow, a better steer; but uppermos all the speeches of those breeders was this wonderful exhibit o d-welfare leading directly to the idealized citizenship of th ire. And I thought as I sat at those long tables and listened t discussion of better breeding and better stock raising, and mor feet children, I thought what a fine thing it would be, if alon h those things, we gave some attention to the proper birth, th per training, the proper rearing, the proper development of th Id of agriculture. I came home from Oregon, proud of being a Nebraskan, proud of Nebraska; but I brought home with me, too, some lessons which I had learned from the Oregonians. I thank you, gentlemen. (Cheers.) </seg>
            <seg id="p124">124 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE K To astm aster Wilson: A note has been handed to me asking we call upon Mike Lee of Omaha, a member of the legislature, resentative Lee of Douglas is called for. KMr. Lee: Mr. Toastmaster, and ladies and gentlemen: I ik you for the honor you have conferred upon me by inviting to be present this evening, and I thank you for the distinguished &gt;r of asking me to speak to you upon this occasion. I know very little about farming, the real practical side of farm - ing. Forty years ago, I came in an immigrant train out here from the east. There are probably here tonight some of the sons and grandsons of the men who came in those immigrant trains, and when I look around me and think of those original farmers who came in those immigrant trains in the early seventies, when I think of their heroism, their bravery, when I think of the kind of men they must have been to come out here pioneers in a new state and build it up and make it the splendid place to live in that it is today, I think, gentlemen, that' you should be proud of these fathers and grandfathers, those brave men who came out here and developed this wilderness into this beautiful state which now blossoms as the rose. I remember well our entrance into Nebraska; how we crossed the Missouri River, and what a desolate sandy country it was; muddy and dirty; and the little old shanties in Omaha, and the desolate prairie stretching beyond. My stock of courage was all gone when we reached Omaha; and when I think what Omaha is now and what it was then, I wonder that I ever had the courage to remain — that I did not turn around and go back. But I say it gentlemen, and am not ashamed, that I had not the courage to go farther than Omaha, and I have remained there ever since. II came from the cultured east. I was living at Saratoga, New rk, when I left in the train for the west and stopped at Omaha; 1 I tell you when I landed there, and looked at that little dirty .n of 12,000 or 15,000 inhabitants, my heart sank. I had left ity with elms and oaks along the streets and primroses and daisies the yards, almost as beautiful as old Ireland herself, to come out this forlorn God-forsaken town of Omaha, and I wondered how r human being could have the heart to go farther west. But it was some of you men and your fathers, and grandfathers who had the sublime courage to go farther west, to endure the hard - ships of the pioneer days; and only we who have been through them know just what those hardships were. They took the advice of wise and great men like J. Sterling Morton and Dr. George L. Miller; they planted trees and grass seeds, and in a little while the blue grass began to come up and the trees to sprout and the flowers to bloom. They kept on working and toiling and enduring privations in order that you men here tonight might enjoy the heritage of the privilege of living in the State of Nebraska as it is today. (Cheers.) good many years afterwards I had occasion to go out to tana on business, and as I went through Idaho and Wyoming, </seg>
            <seg id="p125">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 125 there were miles and miles of nothing but sage brush and sand, no vegetation, nothing growing at all; and then as the train rolled into Nebraska, and we came on east, I looked out of the window, and it was just like Hanscom Park in Omaha, as compared with Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. (Cheers.) I There were green fields and yellow fields, beautiful grass, and irkling streams. I compared it in thought with the state as was when I first came into it, and my heart went out to those ive pioneers who had made these things possible. Since I came down here to the legislature, I went over to th poultry show, and when I learned there that the output of the poultry business for Nebraska was forty-three millions of dollars annually I said, "My God, man, is that possible?" I asked him ove again. I thought I had misunderstood. I thought he must hav meant forty-three millions of dollars for the whole country; but afte inquiring I found that was right, and I thought of the work of th wives of the farmers of Nebraska which would make such a recor&lt; as that possible. When I think that this is just a small part of th work which the farmers of Nebraska do — this is done mostly b the good wives of the farmers of the state — and when I thin that the farmers of Nebraska hate to ask for an appropriation o $25,000 for a building in which to exhibit these products, it strikes me that you are too modest, entirely too modest, gentlemen (Cheers.) I If there is any body of men in the state who have the right ask for it, it is organized agriculture. I know that whenever a mber of the legislature talks about an appropriation he is sure make a hit, (laughter) but I am not trying to make a hit tonight; ay this because I believe it; because I believe that the Nebraska mer has a right to ask for what he needs, and what he wants, I that he is only taking his own when he asks for a building in ich to exhibit his products. (Cheers.) tl see that I have struck the right spot. (Laughter.) Wherever ember of the legislature goes when the session is on, there is sone close around who wants an appropriation; (laughter) but lieve that you men are entitled to it; you have built up Ne - ka; you have made it a good place for all of us to live in. •e is no reason why we should not vote for an appropriation of ,000 with which to build a suitable building upon the fair nds which, as I take it, is also a memorial to the heroism and stry of those men of whom I have just spoken. Talking about appropriations, look at Douglas County, if you please. Why we have appropriated more in the last four or five years than the whole State of Nebraska, and we are not broke yet. (Laughter.) We pulled down a high school that cost $100,000 and put up one that cost a million and a half. We pulled down a court house that cost us a quarter of a million dollars, and paid a man $8,000 to pull it down for us, and put in its place a palace that </seg>
            <seg id="p126">126 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Pus a million and a quarter. Now, when anybody says anything ou about an appropriation of $108,000 to be paid by the whole e of Nebraska, tell him to come down to Douglas County and us. (Cheers.) I You ought to get your appropriation through and I am willing go on record as being for it first-, last and all the time. I thank i. (Cheers.) TOASTM ASTER WILSON: Well — KMr. Rudge: Mr. Toasthaster, we have with us tonight a tlemen whom I am told can make a good speech, and I know can tell a good story. We would like to hear from him. The f Rev. L. J. Kline of Brainard. Toastmaster: Rev. Kline is called for. Rev. Kline: Mr. Toastmaster, ladies and gentlemen: I am very grateful that through the courtesy of my friend, Mr. Odell, I am permitted to be with you tonight. I have enjoyed the dinner and the speeches very much indeed, but I don't feel that there is anything I can add, unfortunately, to the subjects which have been discussed here this evening. I Still I wish to say that it has given me a great deal of pleasure delight to meet with you tonight. I have been greatly enter id and instructed. I have never exhibited anything at the State and I have never given that part of it much thought or atten but since I have been here this evening, I am not so sure bu I might be prevailed upon to change my mind. I think it was two years ago on a beautiful August day that Mr. Odell came to Brainard to visit me. I had just harvested a nice lot of comb honey. As you probably know, I am a beekeeper. I keep bees as a side issue, and so I think I am in the agricultural business. (Cheers.) II had a 16t of bees. Mr. Odell looked over the honey and said Iy goodness, Father, what a fine lot of honey! You ought to libit it at Lincoln at our State Fair, Father." But I said "No," the voice of the tempter. However, since I have sat in this splendid iience and listened to the talks that have been given, I have tught that next year I might be tempted to listen to the sweet ig of my estimable friend. (Cheers.) I thank you, gentlemen. (Cheers.) »Mr. Odell: Father Kline did not tell all of that story. I ted him to bring or send in his exhibit. He said "Oh, I haven't time to prepare it." I said, "Father Kline, if you will send exhibit down to Lincoln I will prepare it and get it ready for " He said, "Oh, Mr. Odell, you are too busy a man for that." lid, "Well, Father, I can do it on Sunday. If I do, will you it me absolution?" And he said, "Yes I will if you are sorry it." (Laughter and Cheers.) I Toastmaster Wilson: The next subject on the program e Good of the Association," will be discussed by our esteemed Btary W. R. Mellor. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 127 GOOD OF THE ASSOCIATION This subject is one which calls to our mind a period of a long term of years. Many members of this gathering remember the time when a little body of men in the home town gathered in some law - yer's office or the town hall and resolved to form a County Agricul - tural Society under Chapter One, of our Statutes, entitled "Agricul - ture." The Constitution and By-Laws were compiled and each of us signed our name to same and agreed to pay a certain amount for the privilege of membership. Some of us were elected as officers, and some of us were satisfied with being a "private in the ranks." The land on which the county fair ground was to be located was secured, and then came the period of construction. How we watched the progress made by those who builded our race track and buildings, and when time for our first fair approached how we all "boosted." What a success it was! It is true that at our first fair some of our members were disgruntled. They imagined their toes had been, trodden upon, that they had not received the proper attention and a thousand and one other conditions which are common to every community; from which fact our association and its influences were thereafter divided into three distinct classes — those who worked faithfully for its success, those who were indifferent, and the "knock - ers." The first class were those who were faithful to the welfare of their association and the community. Possibly in the reconstruc - tion which followed you were called from "high private in the rear rank" to official position; you were one of those recognized untiring personages in the community who made an effort to do well that with which your citizens entrusted you. The measure of your success has been reflected by the success of your fair. This may not be absolutely correct in each particular instance, as no association can combat with the elements, but if your exhibits and advertising have been builded by competent hands the object lesson measured the effort and work performed. The untiring energy of Fair officials is the necessary requirement for general success. Remember, you cannot build your Fair in a week and make it satisfactory. The successful Fair represents many hours of thought and labor extending over a period of considerable time Let each one of you who desire great success next year go horn with a firm resolve to begin the organization for the coming Fair by securing an active assistant in each township of your county t drum that particular township for exhibits. Secure the interest o your county Superintendent of public schools, have the pupils writ essays and prepare exhibits. Get the children talking about it — they are fine advertisers. Do not be satisfied with this, but each time the opportunity presents, solicit the farmers from each respec - tive township to co-operate in an effort to have their township the banner in representation. They will not pay much attention, to your first request, nor the second nor the third, but when they </seg>
            <seg id="p128">128 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE t assured that you are in earnest they will begin to think there jmething in it; and the idea that they are of influence and im - ance in the making of the exhibit will gradually soak in, and lly you will find in them able assistants. It is true that many les will fall by the wayside, but some of those who are blessed 1 sufficient energy will respond, and from such response comes incentive for better stock, better farming, better and more resting schools, and better home conditions. Isn't it worth ng for? I "Oh", but you say, "that takes a lot of work." Yes, it does, an&lt; are the fellows on whom such work devolves, you are the public ited men in the community in which you reside. You often that your neighbors are placing the burden too heavily upon i and are inclined to rebel, but you go on and do the beat you oftentimes grumbling at first, but finally realizing that success es only by labor, and that those who are naturally endowed by Creator must bear life's burdens although the load may seem 'y; the greater the burden the greater becomes your capacity labor with corresponding enjoyment in the success accomplished. I We know many times the thought comes that you are neglecting )ortunities for wealth accumulation, but remember that outside what is necessary to comfortably clothe and feed you, wealth only a vehicle to purchase a moment of satisfaction, and satis - tion gained through effort is far sweeter than that purchased by ney. Therefore, get the idea of giasping for money out of your nds entirely, for you have a higher mission to fulfill — that of service the benefit of others. I When you begin the campaign for the coming Fair, be constant urging the department Superintendent to feel the responsibility i good exhibit in his department, and you will find that insistent jestion will help him greatly to "get into the harness of effort." My subject is "The Good of the Association," and by this time some of you may be wondering why I do not deal directly with the subject. Let me state that the foundation is the important part in any structure. The State Board of Agriculture is the outcome of this body. Every county fair is an integral part of this State Board, and its success is based largely on your success. The pros - perity or adversity of the integral parts flows and courses through the veins of the Board as truly as it would in the human body. Nearly every member on the State Board of Agriculture is from your selec - tion and taken from those who have done something in their home society; therefore your prosperity is ours — ours is yours. The law makes our interests inseparable, therefore I would suggest that in addition to paying the railroad fare and six dollars to each of your accredited delegates, in the future the State Board of Agriculture consider the feasibility of furnishing this "get together" dinner for each officer of the county fairs represented. Here closer relation - ships are formed, here should be imparted the incentive for renewed </seg>
            <seg id="p129">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 129 purpose to do better next year than we have in the past, and no better time or place can be obtained. We want every county fair in the state a member of this body. I We would suggest that the dues in this organization be reduced one dollar per member, and if that is too much, let us chip in each meeting enough to pay the postage and printing bill of the retary. If a member cannot pay, come anyway. You are wel - le, but pay when you can. tThe State Board of Agriculture will publish the proceedings of this ing each year, and gladly do anything within its power to rially aid and assist any of you at any time upon request. We d have you feel that we are all working not only for our selfish ests, but for the upbuilding of Nebraska, the best state of the country on earth. Toastmaster Wilson: We have had a splendid evening and I know that everyone has enjoyed it as hugely as I have. I have enjoyed everyone of these speeches, and I am going home with some new ideas. I have received a great deal of good from this meeting and I believe that everyone here has done the same. I Mr. Rudge: There is one gentleman that I think we ought hear from before we leave tonight, and that is Mr. Hervey. Toastmaster Wilson: Mr. Hervey is called for. I want to say for Mr. Hervey, that ever since this organization has been started he has been in the front ranks as one of the workers. tMR. Hervey: I am very much pleased with the progress this iciation has made. I did not expect to be called upon here ght. I think the program as carried out has been a most splendid and will be a great benefit to the organization. In having just i meetings as this we are carrying out the primary intentions which this association was organized. These experience meetings mg the managers of the county fairs emphasize the object for ch the organization stands. I feel greatly pleased with the pro - is this association has made. I It may not be known generally, but the county fair associations Nebraska are incorporated, and it is one of the finest things that ever been done, not only for the success of the Fairs, but for progress of the counties in which the fairs are held. (Cheers.) I These get-together meetings held between fair managers awaken interest in the business, and talking over our successes and our ires is certainly most beneficial to every one of us. There is ays a question in my mind whether we profit most by success or failure. To my mind there is nothing in this state that is doing e for the progress and upbuilding of the state than these various nty fairs which are held each fall all over the state II think the management of the county fairs in the older states, the east, have drifted backwards and I cannot see that there any comparison between the fairs that are held in those states ay and those that are held in the State of Nebraska. I think 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE im right when I say that the eastern fairs are not one quarter good now as they were thirty years ago. Their county fairs going backward because they have no association spirit and ause they do not keep up a lively interest and keep up to date they should. They do not keep their grounds improved and good shape. They exhibit the same old thing in many depart - its year after year; and, as I say, their fairs are not as good t as they were thirty years ago. They ship in most of their : stock exhibits now, so that the best exhibits that they have juently come from outside counties and states. tOhio, the great sheep state, always sends to its county fairs ce sheep exhibit. There is generally a very poor exhibit of beef e at county fairs in the eastern states. Dairy cattle, Holsteins Jerseys prevail. The eastern states have all gone into the dairy ness. Their exhibits in horticulture amount to practically noth - they really have none at all. And I tell you, when you visit e of those county fairs you come back very much prouder of raska than you were when you went away. (Cheers.) I believe that this splendid condition which exists in Nebraska is due directly to the fact of the interest taken in our county fair associations. I believe if you would disband the county fair organi - zation in this state that you would dissolve the State Fair. Where can you find another state that puts up as fine an agricultural exhibit as is put up at the Nebraska State Fairs. Minnesota has a good agricul - tural exhibit, but it does not compare with Nebraska; and it is the only state that comes anywhere near our exhibit. Over in Iowa, which is of course a great agricultural state, you will find eight or nine counties exhibiting at their state fair in a way that looks as though they had not exerted themselves, and made an effort to get up a good exhibit. They do not make much exertion for an agricul - tural display at their fair or do anything in this way to promote their agricultural industry. For instance, they have been offering between $500.00 and $600.00, and Nebraska offers between $2,500 and $3,000 as a money incentive for county exhibits at the state fair. That is a pretty fair sample of the way Iowa and Nebraska do things, from the standpoint of an agricultural exhibit. (Cheers.) I think a comparison of our exhibits out at the State Fair grounds with those over at the Iowa State Fair will show that Ne - braska is so far ahead of Iowa in this regard, that it will be a long time before they will be able to catch up. They continue to exhibit at the county and at the state fairs, but they do not exhibit as experts, as we are trying to do and do do in this state. I feel con - fident that we make a finer exhibit at the Nebraska State Fair than any State fair in this country. The persons in charge are expert exhibitors, they are not ordinary men. They are first-class trained men in this line of display and they are putting on first - class exhibits of the agricultural products of the state. I do not believe there are any finer agricultural exhibits put up in any state </seg>
            <seg id="p131">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 131 »the Union than we put up on the Nebraska Fair grounds. Out the western states they put up a very good show. We will all re to admit that, but their exhibits are generally put up by pro - lional showmen, experts. It is not the producers themselves who up the exhibits. The matter of agricultural organization, and agricultural exhibits, has become an inexhaustible proposition. A man could talk all night about it and still find new things to say. I feel that the sub - ject has been pretty well gone over tonight, and I have certainly enjoyed everything that I have heard here and have gotten some new ideas from the remarks that have been made, and I believe that you all have. As I said in the beginning, I am very proud of the progress this association has made and hope that you will continue to grow and prosper until we are all old in the fair business. I thank you. (Cheers.) I Mr. Wilson: Has anyone else anything to say upon this ect? If so, we would like to hear from you. I think I have a 1 or two I might say on the subject myself. ~"I will say first, that I have enjoyed the talks made tonight and I think we have all been benefited by this meeting. As our good friend Mr. Hervey has just said, these experience meetings are of the utmost importance, not only to our association but to the counties and the state. This is a matter of education. There is no doubt but what the county fairs are great educational institu - tions, just as our good friend Mr. Odell has said. II enjoyed Mr. Odell's talk very much, and I think every word said about the educational value of the county fair and the e Fair is absolutely true. I would like to have you notice par - tarly what he said about the number of boys and girls on the 1 who will never have the advantage of a university education, link he said that but 410 of the entire number of girls and boys n the farm would be able to go through high school, and less i half of that number would ever matriculate in the university, n he gave the figures of how few ever get beyond the fifth or sixth grade. I absolutely agree with what Mr. Odell said, ; so far as possible the university should be taken to those people a the farms; also that this matter of the university furnishing a com - mt judge for the county fair exhibits is one of the ways in which extension department of the university can extend its educational ities to the boys and girls on the farm. We have great crowds of people at our State Fair but ther are many who do not come, but who do attend the county fairs So, that while I agree with Mr. Odell that the State Fair is th greatest educational institution in the State of Nebraska, at th same time, so many more people attend the county fairs than attent the State Fair that it seems to me it is of the utmost importanc that we extend or give to the county fair people the chance of thi judging so that a greater number of people in the State of Nebrask </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ft receive the benefits of this great educational institution. It as to me that the idea of the university is to serve all people far as possible and I know of no better way in which this can done than by sending out competent judges for the exhibits at county fairs. II think it was Ella Wheeler Wilcox who said, "There are lifters &gt; lift and leaners who lean." I want to go on record as saying t the county fair managers are the lifters, and those who come the Fair and kick and kick about this thing and that are most idedly the leaners. The lifters are the educators, the ones who bearing the burden; and the men who come to the State Fair I kick are the leaners. Such men as Mr. Mellor are most decidedly :rs, and despite the protests and the complaints and the kicks, is doing more in my opinion to upbuild the State of Nebraska n any other one man within the state. There is one other thought that I want to bring out, and that is to refer to the statement made by the Honorable Mike Lee of Douglas County. If we look upon this matter as a loan of state funds for the benefit of the people of the entire state and that it comes back to them in increased value, I believe we will have the true idea; and if we go to our representatives and senators in this spirit I do not doubt but what we will get what we ask for. II have been a little disappointed in this meeting. No one has ie any kicking. I have not heard a single complaint and I don't iw whether that pleases me or not, because I know that some of 11 do make complaints. It seems to me that it would be very ch better to take up these troubles at this meeting and fight them ; here. If you don't tell us your troubles we are not going to be e to help you and give you the benefit of our experience, which the reason for and the intention of these meetings. It is quite ?ly that others here have had troubles similar to yours and would able to assist you by giving you the benefit of their experience. if there is nothing further, our county fair association will up their business session.

When we return for annual meeting next year there will be no complaint to be made, pe. I have always taken a great interest in this work, and while cupy the same position in the farming line that our friend Mike referred to last night, I realize the importance of agricultural i in this state and our dependence upon old Mother Earth. le I am not actually engaged in farming, I know as a business that all of these things go together and belong together.

            <seg id="p138">138 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to go on record as saying that I consider it a very great honor. I have been associated with this Board for nine years and I have always considered it a privilege and a pleasure to work for the up - building of the agricultural interests of this state. The first notice I had that I was called on to become a member of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture was when I was on my farm and the question " Would you accept a position on the State Board of Agriculture if it were tendered to you?" was put to me. I thought a little bit and concluded I would. Prior to that time I had not done any work of this kind. I knew about the workings of the State Board of Agriculture; I knew what they were and what they were doing while I was in Lincoln in 1903. I was then a member of the legislature, and I was a member of the Committee on Public Lands and Buildings at that time. I remember very well that I trudged out to the State Fair grounds through the snow and cold to look over the Fair grounds and their buildings to see what was needed. You cannot take a man out to the State Fair at this time of year and show him the buildings out there and impress upon him the conditions as they actually exist during Fair time. It is utterly impossible when everything is closed up and covered with ice and snow; and it is certainly embarrassing to take a member of the legislature out there and try to impress upon him what our needs actually are. You go out there now and it looks as though we had too much room and too many buildings instead of not enough. They all look big and barn-like. I am proud that since then I have been able to help in my humble way to raise the standard of Ne - braska Agriculture until now our State Fair is known all over the country and even in Europe. tThat reminds me that there is one thing I want to confess thi ling and relieve my conscience, for it has troubled me a goo&lt; I have been carrying this load upon my conscience for at leas years. I made a trip to Europe about two years ago and essed upon one gentleman over there that the Nebraska Stat was on the map. IBut what I want to confess is, that when I was preparing for trip two years ago it occurred to me that I would need some b, traveling over there in Europe where I was not known, and oke of it one day to my friend Ross Hammond of the Hammond ting Company, I said to him, " Ross, I am going to Europe and ant to have some cards printed, something appropriate, some - g that will look right when I hand them to one of those fellows on the other side." I had held some positions in Nebraska, been a member of the Commissioners at Fremont, but Ross ight that looked pretty little. He said, "Joe, you know Dodge nty doesn't cut very much figure and wouldn't make much of E lowing over there. Aren't you connected some way with the raska State Board of Agriculture?" I said, "Yes, I'm Second -President." Then he said, "Oh well, there's no use leaving </seg>
            <seg id="p139">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICULTURE 139 that 'Second' on there, we will just print the cards and make it Vice-President of the State Board of Agriculture. That will make you a title that will look like something. So he went to work and printed them up; and when I go^t the cards I was a little surprised and relieved too to hear him say, "Joe, this is a little donation to you." So you will see that while I am confessing that I used the title you will see that I am freed from the charge of buying the title. However, I started with the cards, and on the trip whenever I had occasion to show who I was I would pull a card. I never said anything about being 'Second' either." (Laughter and Cheer*. ) I About the fourth day after my arrival at my old home at Corn - 1 there was a Royal Corn Men's Show. I attended and found t a friend of mine, one of my school boy friends, was President the institution. I went in to see him. I remembered the name, I I pulled my card on him. (Laughter.) Of course, he recog - ed that I was somebody of importance when he saw the State wd of Agriculture of Nebraska printed on that card. My friend took me around to show me the exhibits in thi Corn Men's Show. He took me to the dairy exhibits and stoc exhibits. They were all together over there, and I could see as h took me around that he was very proud, and thought he was show ing me something that I had never seen in my life before. Every once in a while as we came to exhibits he would look very prouc and say, " Did you ever see anything like that in your country? But as long as he was so kind and so anxious to treat me nicely am be courteous, you know I felt sorry for him and didn't feel like tellin him what we really did have over in this country. I just felt like letting it go. I'm a pretty good American, and as we went along and I kept looking at the exhibits, I kept having a growing feeling that I wasn't going to be able to hold in very much longer. Finally, we came to the machine exhibit. I had been courteous all the way through, it was about time to say good-bye, and I thought I was going to get through all right. Finally he looked at me and said with a sort of pity, "Well, I've shown you something that you have never seen over in your country." I left the land of my birth twenty-seven years ajo and I have lived in America long enough to become a pretty goad American and I couldn't stand that. So I said to him, " My dear sir, outside of one or two of your exhibits you are not a drop in the bucket to the State Fair that we hold annually in Nebraska." (Cheers.) tl said, "You have two exhibits, your sheep and your jumping ;es, which are the only two in which you outdo or come up to ' If I were to go back now, after having attended the Inter - onal Exposition ' at Chicago I would have to take back my arks about the sheep exhibit. I saw just as fine sheep at the uago Show as I saw over there. But now, John Bull was ruffled and he said " Well, let me show you the machinery exhibit." tone indicated that he was going to show me something now </seg>
            <seg id="p140">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 140 that we didn't have in America. I tell you, then I did feel sorry for him, for he showed me a Walter A. Wood self-binding reaper (Laughter.) I couldn't help it then, my Americanism was up too and I said, " Why, in America that has been thrown in the corner years ago. We would never think of buying such a machine as that now. " He didn't know what to think of that, but he said "Look at these mowers." I looked, gentlemen, and I saw a Deering Mower with the iron pit — that dropped in like this with a slot on the side; no ball bearing or anything of that kind; and again I told him that that type of mower had been discarded long ago in our country. I have wondered, gentlemen, since I've come back — I have heard a good many men make the remark at various times, that machinery could be bought a good deal cheaper over in England than in America. But I want to go on record here as saying that I don't wonder it can if they pan off that kind of machinery on the folks over in Europe. That's the kind of machinery that no self-respecting farmer in America would buy. (Cheers.) I couldn't help comparing everything I saw in their machinery exhibit with our machinery department which we have every fall at the Nebraska State Fair. Gentlemen, there was no comparison. I came back feeling that our country was the best and the most progressive of them all, and I think that Mr. Mellor when he re - turned from Oberammergau, Germany, came back feeling the same way. Now our friend Rudge has his passports in his pocket and is going over to Europe very shortly on a trip, and I venture to say that he will come back with the same idea. tl'm glad that I have my conscience cleared about the cards, rant to say right now that those cards did me a lot of good over that country. They thought I was a pretty big man and I felt tty proud every time I pulled one of them out of my pocket. »I thank you, gentlemen, for the honor you have conferred upon and I will do my best to serve you in the future as I have done the past. (Cheers.) L President Haws: The next in order will be nomination for nd Vice-President. LMr. PuRCELL: I wish to nominate Mr. J. A. Ollis, Jr., for nd Vice-President. Mr. Danielson: I move that the rules be suspended, that the Secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous vote of this con - vention to J. A. Ollis, Jr., the Sixth District, for Second Viee- President. Member: I second that motion. Haws: Gentlemen, you have heard the motion.

All those favor make it manifest by saying AYE. Contrary, NO. The Ayes have it. It is so ordered. </seg>
            <seg id="p141">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 141 I Secretary Mellor: Mr. President, it gives me pleasure as retary of this association to cast the unanimous vote for Mr. A.. Ollis, Jr., Second Vice-President of the Nebraska State Board Agriculture. President Haws: Mr. Ollis is elected and called for speech. I Mr. Ollis: Mr. President and gentlemen, I certainly want to that I appreciate the honor you have bestowed upon me in king me Second Vice-President of this association. I don't wan take up any of your time, but I do want to emphasize the fac t I appreciate this honor. Although my friend Roberts was amed to be called Second Vice-President of the State Board o •iculture when he was over in the old country, I want to say to i that I am not. (Laughter.) I think that any man who is interested in the line of work thi Board is doing in the State of Nebraska may well feel proud to b connected with it in any manner. The reason I feel proud is tha the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture is doing things in Nebraska and I think that in accepting the honor of this responsible positio that I shall become one of the body of men whose efforts will accom plish great things for our state and for Organized Agriculture, think that I can conscientiously say that I have never asked fo a vote for any position in this society, not because I would no appreciate the vote or because I am unmindful of the honor, bu because I have thought that this society was composed of a bod of representative men in Nebraska who knew whom they wante&lt; to select for their offices, but I do deeply appreciate the honor o this election. You heard the report of your Secretary which was read yester - day morning in regard to the importance of this Board and the work that it is doing. He told you of the conditions under which the Board was working and what was needed on the State Fair grounds. This is, strictly speaking, an agricultural state and I believe that as an agricultural state we are entitled to the proper building! in which to house our exhibits. I know that these buildings are needed and I believe that the State Board of Agriculture is entitled to some recognition in the State of Nebraska and that they should have it. I believe that they can get it, and I believe that now is the time. Of course, there is only one way to get it and that is through the legislature, and we will ask the legislature to appropriate $108,000 for buildings and grounds. As everyone of you know, it is not an easy matter to get an appropriation of that size through the legis - lature. You must realize that your part of the work is to show the members of this legislature that everyone of their constituents, or the major part of them in the counties from which they come are interested in this appropriation and want it passed. I want to make a suggestion to you this morning. You know that I will do every - thing I can for you over at the State House, but there are a great many things that I cannot do. When you go home I want you to </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE get the people in your district interested and get them to write a letter to their representatives and senators asking them to vote for this appropriation. Some people seem to think that if you have one legislator on your side it will be easy enough to get a bill through; but of course I realize that none of you men think that. It is not easy to get any bill through, and especially any bill that carries with it an appropriation. In order to get any kind of an appropriation through the legislature it is necessary to have 51 per cei t of the members of both houses vote for it. There are a lot of people who always want to fight shy of an appropriation bill and the tax payers are apt to say that they are paying taxes and the money is being squandered. I think myself that is sometimes true; but this appro - priation, gentlemen, is one that is needed and the money will be carefully used I know. But the question is, to get the men who have the vote to see it that way. I know that every cent of money which has been appropriated for the State Board of Agriculture has been needed and has been well and carefully expended. You are asking for an appropriation of $108,000. I believe you ought to have it. You have men here today who are representative men from all over the State of Nebraska. I ask you now to go to your homes and speak to your friends and neighbors, to everyone you know, and get them to get to work and write to their represen - tatives and senators and do their level best to inform the legislature what they want done on this appropriation bill. There is no question but what, if the members of the legislature think that the majority of their people, those who elected them and sent them to Lincoln, want the appropriation to go through they will vote for it; but if you men just say "Amen" and "All right" and quit at that, go home, and do nothing about it and leave it all to Mr. Haws and Mr. Mellor, it may not go through. Each of you must do your individual part in this matter if you want to get this appropriation through. No doubt every one of you know the member of the legislature from your district and probably most of you know two or three members, not only from your district but some other district. It is up to you now to see those men, to write those men, and to get everyone that you know out in your section who is interested in Organized Agriculture and interested in seeing the appropriation passed to write these legislators. That is the only way we will ever be able to get this bill through. No doubt everyone of you have neighbors who have some influence. Get them to write the members of the legislature. Now is the time for you to get busy along this line. There is no question about the need of this appro - priation, or that you should have it go through, but it is also a fact that you will have to do some real work on it before we will be able to get it through. tl want to thank you again for the honor conferred upon me in ing me to the position of Second Vice-President of the Nebraska ! Board of Agriculture. It gives me pleasure to be associated </seg>
            <seg id="p143">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 143 with you. You can rely upon me to do everything for you that I can. I will be glad to serve you and the board of managers in the future as I have done in the past. I shall endeavor to spend all the time that is necessary in the work of this Board and use my best thoughts and endeavors toward the good of the State Board. Gentlemen, I thank you. I Cheers.) ■ President Haws: The next in order will be the nomination Treasurer of this association. Member: Mr. President, I rise to nominate the Honorable George F. Dickman, of Seward, as Treasurer for the ensuing year. Mr. McArdle: I want to second that nomination. I have a word that I want to say too, although I may be out of order, and that is in regard to the salary that the Treasurer is receiving. It does not strike me as either fair or right that the Treasurer of this associatior should be receiving the same salary now when he is handling $150,000 a year, that he received when we were taking in only $15,000 a year. I know the amount of work Mr. Dickman does. I know that he is conscientious and competent and everyone of you know the same, and I don't think that it is fair or right that we should expect him to go on working for the same amount that he has been doing in the past. You all realize that the more money he handles the more work he has to do; and I think if we appreciate his services we will see to it that he receives a larger salary next JMr. Graff: I move, Mr. President, that the rules be suspended I that Mr. George F. Dickman be declared the unanimous choice this association for Treasurer for the ensuing year. Member: I second that motion. t President Haws: Gentlemen, you heard the motion. It has moved and seconded that the rules be suspended, and the itary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of this conven - for Mr. George Dickman of Seward for Treasurer. Are there remarks? If not, all those in favor of the motion manifest ' saying AYE. Contrary, NO. The Ayes have it; it is so ordered. Secretary Mellor: Mr. President, it gives me pleasure to ! the fifty-seven votes of this convention for Mr. George F. kman of Seward as Treasurer of the State Board of Agriculture the ensuing year. President Haws: Mr. Dickman is elected and called for. I Mr. Dickman: Mr. President, and gentlemen of the Nebraska ate Board of Agriculture, I did not know that my friend McArdle is going to spring what he did. I am sure that I con ider it an nor to represent you as your Treasurer for the ensuing year, and thank you for the election. It has always been my aim to go ;ht ahead and do just the best that I could for this Board. I til continue to do my duty in the future as I see it. Mr. Graff: Mr. President, I don't believe it is the intention </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of this meeting to pass over the remarks, or resolution, or the motion, or whatever you call it, that was made by Mr. McArdle in regard to increasing the salary of the Treasurer. I believe in saying what Mr. McArdle did that he represented the sentiments of this meeting. I believe the Treasurer of this association should have more money now than he received two years ago when we were not doing any - where near the amount of business that we do each year now out at the Fair. You all appreciate the fact that the Treasurer's work has been increased more than double, and I believe all of us are of the opinion that he should be paid for it. I believe in paying an officer for his labors. We cannot expect a man to give us efficient service and do it all for glory. I believe this is the proper time to take this matter up, and if it is not, then I am out nf the order; But if I am not out of order, I want to make a motion that this matter of salary, or increase of salary, for the Treasurer be taken up at this time. Mr. Rudge: Mr. President, I believe this would be the better way to handle it, and I move you that a committee of three be appointed, consisting of Mr. McArdle, Mr. Ollis, and Mr. Graff, to bring in a resolution as to what they think the Treasurer's salary should be. Member: I second that motion. President Haws: Gentlemen, you have heard the motion. It has been moved and seconded that the chair appoint a committee comsisting of Mr. McArdle, Mr. Graff and Mr. Ollis who will im - mediately confer and bring in a report in regard to the Treasurer's salary. Are you ready for the question? Member: Question. President Haws: All those in favor of the motion make it manifest by saying AYE. Contrary, NO. The AYES have it; it is so ordered. The Chair will appoint Mr. McArdle, Mr. Graff, and Mr. Ollis the committee to confer on the matter of increasing the Treasurer's salary, and will ask them to retire and let us have the report at once. President Haws: The next in order will be the election of the Secretary for the coming year. We will hear nominations. Mr. Kendall: I arise, Mr. President, to nominate our very capable and efficient Secretary, Mr. W. R. Mellor as our Secretary for the ensuing year. Seconded by the entire house. Member: I move, Mr. President, that the rules be suspended and that the President be instructed to cast the entire vote of this a sociation for W. R. Mellor as Secretary for the ensuing year. President Haws: You have heard the motion. All those in favor make it manifest by saying AYE. There are no No's. The Ayes have it unanimously. </seg>
            <seg id="p145">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 145 RMr. Mellor you are Secretary for another year without a dis - ting vote. (Cheers.) Secretary Mellor: Gentlemen, this is the eighth time that I have responded when you have selected me as Secretary of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. You have called me to this Ejrable position for that number of times, for which I thank you. that I can say is that I will try to serve you in the future as ve done in the past. I was very much interested in what Mr. Roberts said about his visit to the old country. I too made a trip to the old country. I visited the British, Japan, and the Brussel's expositions, and some of the other notable places and I could not help but draw com - parisons also. I could not help but compare their race meets with ours. I attended the Ascot races, and I could not help but compare the way their races were handled and managed, the purses that were put up over there with ours, and the way we took care of our race events over here with theirs. The day I was at the Ascot races there were at least 50,000 people there. They were scattered all around in the center of the ring somewhere near the track, except those who could afford to pay thirty shillings for a seat in the grand - stand. I had a seat in the grandstand for I was over there to see and hear and be informed. I also paid five cents a mile to get out there from the city of London. A great many of the nobility were there and the hangers-on of the nobility. The races consisted of five running races none of which could be seen when started. As I said, I had one of the best points of vantage for sight seeing. We could see them coming running on the grassy sod, over the gently undulating track. The Ascot track is two and a half miles long and track preparation there consists in mowing the grass and rolling. It is not leveled and worked as our race tracks are. f Another thing that drew my attention particularly was the tting. They do a great deal of betting over in the old country. One of the betting fraternity perched upon the grandstand waved his arms, as indicated by their wigwagging code, and the initiated seemed to know how to lay their money according to the way he was manipulating his arms. This is what we would call betting on a sure thing. It struck me as a "cinch." Most of the fairs and exhibitions which I attended did not in any way compare with those we have in this country, with possibly the exception of the Brussel's Exposition. They had the finest exhibits there of manufactured products I have ever seen, better I think even than at the World's Fair at Chicago, or St. Louis; but to me the truly amazing thing was that they did not seem to have any agricultural exhibit at all. I looked around and could not find one thing pertaining to agriculture. They didn't seem to think agriculture was very important. Another thing that I noticed is how little of the work they do by machinery. In Italy, Austria, and Germany they do almost everything by hand. Their farms are </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 just little patches of a few acres, in some cases, generally fifty feet wide, possibly three to five hundred feet long. The farmers all live in little towns and walk out to the farms to work them. No one seems to live on the farms or have any farm home. I saw over a thousand people working in the hay fields there and I never saw one mowing machine of any kind. They mow with a little sickle, or in a few instances, a scythe. Where twenty people were at work in a field one would be a man, and the other nineteen would be women. There are so many people over there with so little ground in proportion that they live upon the returns from small patches of land and do almost all of their work by hand, most of which is done by the women. They really get the best they can out of the farm. There is not a weed to be seen. It is a matter of necessity with them. We hear a good deal of talk about intensive farming, and to a certain degree it is an excellent thing. They seem to be doing it over there from necessity, and their rural population certainly does not seem as prosperous. As a matter of fact they are not as prosperous as our farmers in Nebraska. They may be happy, they probably are. I do not think a man's happiness is measured by the amount of worldly goods that he has. I don't think you can measure happiness by money, but I will say that if prosperity and success go to make happiness, the rural population in the old country are certainly not as well off as they are right here in Nebraska. My wife said that when I was over in the old country I was all the time comparing it with Nebraska to Nebraska's advantage and the old country's disadvantage. She said that I spent all my time com - paring the things over there with those in Nebraska and their exhibits with our State Fair exhibits, and I guess maybe I did; but that naturally was on my mind all the time and I could not help but notice the great difference in the conditions over there in comparison with our agricultural or rural conditions in the State of Nebraska. It was because I was interested in that line of business. t There is one thing I want to speak of while I am talking here morning, then I will not take up any more of your time, that s the question touched upon by Senator Ollis. I want to urge upon every one of you to take to heart what Senator Ollis has said to you this morning, and when you go home endeavor to bring some pressure to bear upon your representatives and senators in the legis - lature. If we are going to get that building out at the State Fair grounds that we so much need, this work will have to be done, and it will have to be done by you. As Mr. Ollis has said, this cannot all be left to the officers of this association. Every individual member has got to work for it. These buildings are needed at the State Fair grounds, and in order for us to carry on our business there they are absolutely necessary. As the Senator has said, we all know it is a very difficult matter to get an appropriation of any size or kind through the legislature, and in order to secure this we will have to do some active and vigorous work with our legislators. </seg>
            <seg id="p147">147 each one of you with your own representative from your district I believe that by a concerted effort in this direction our object can be accomplished. It is a most difficult thing to be able to convince or . to show the members of the legislature the great need of thi building unless they understand just exactly the situation as eacl one of us understands it, but the point for us to bear down upon is how much we need it, and why we need it. Make them under stand as nearly as we can our need for it, and our reason for askir for it. If every one will make this a personal matter and see to i that his representative or his senator is approached on this matte and understands the situation I believe that we cannot fail to ge it through, but just one or two of us neglecting or overlookin this part of the work might mean the defeat of the bill. I hop when you go home each one of you will feel that there is a persona obligation upon you to take this matter up with your representativ from your district. When you go to your home have some of you friends, many of your friends, all of your friends, write to the reprc sentatives of the legislature here at Lincoln. If you will all do tha we will get our appropriation I am sure. Gentlemen, I thank you (Cheers.) Mr. Graff: Mr. President, your recently appointed committee is ready to report. I President Haws: We will listen to the report of the committee the increase in the Treasurer's salary. »Mr. Graff: Mr. President, your committee recommends the .ry of the Treasurer of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture increased to $350.00 per annum. Respectfully submitted, Chas. Graff John F. McArdle J. A. Ollis, Jr. kMR. Mellor: Mr. President, I move that the report of the mittee and the resolution be adopted as read, and that the isurer's salary be increased to $350.00 per annum. Member: I second that motion. President Haws: You have heard the report of the committee, reading of the resolution, and the moiion by Secretary Mellor t the resolution be adopted as read that the Treasurer's salary increased to $350.00 per year. All those in favor make it manifest saying AYE. Opposed, NO. The Ayes have it; it is so ordered. L President Haws: Is there any other business to come before meeting before we adjourn? Mr. Graff: Mr. President, the last two or three years I have noticed that our annual meeting is held at the same time that they hold the Denver Livestock Show in Denver, and I have thought that perhaps there was some way that this could be changed as there are a good many of the Nebraska people, members of this </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 Iird, who would like very much to attend the Livestock Show at nver, but cannot do it on account of our time of meeting con - ting with theirs. A great many of us are interested in both of meetings and would like to attend both of them. It seems to me might get together with the Denver people and have these meet - s changed so that they will not conflict. A good many of the mem - s of the State Board are interested in that Livestock Association eting at Denver, and sometimes feel that they have to go out re and let this meeting go by the board. If they come here they is something they want to see and should attend to out there. • ould like to ask that the Secretary of this Board take it up with Livestock Association in Denver and see if it cannot be arranged that the two would not come in the same week. Mr. Haws: Do you maks that a motion? Mb. Graff: I move you, Mr. President, that the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture of Nebraska be instructed to take this matter up with the board of managers of the Denver Livestock Show, and see if the time of the Denver meeting cannot be changed, so that the two will not conflict. Member: I second the motion. I Mr. Von Forell: I don't know whether there are very many braska people who like to go out to that Denver Livestock Show not, but I do know that every year there are a few of our mem - s who go to Denver instead of coming here because they are i in the same week. I would like to go there myself. I would i to be out there right now. I prefer of course to be here with i men and feel that my first duty is here, but I would like to go Denver. I want to make two speeches in one, Mr. President, while I have the floor. I want to speak also on this matter of appropriation before the legislature. I have been interested in the State Agricul - tural interests in Nebraska and have been on record for that for over twenty years. I have spoken to some of our representatives already on this subject and I intend to speak to everyone I know and to write to everyone I know. They have all told me that they would support this appropriation bill, but I am not going to be satis - fied with that. When I get home I am going to write them a letter and I think that every member of this Board should do the same thing. Go on record and put them on record. We want to get that State Fair in shape so it will be a Fair to be proud of. We can't do it without having the proper buildings for the handling o our business and for the exhibiting of our products. We want to make that Fair a great educational institution, such as ore of th speakers said last night it should be, and I know all of us want t see it in that class. I think that should be our first consideration and I realize as all of us do that we cannot make much improvemen along that line until we have a better building for the exhibition of our products. We want to make the State Fair a great education* </seg>
            <seg id="p149">149 institution. I want a Fair out there that I can take my son to, and when he goes he will come away with a taste in his mouth, such a taste that will make him want to go again. We want the young people to be interested in this State Fair. When we take our boys to the State Fair we want it to be such an exhibition that they will go home with a different idea and see things that pertain to agricul - ture in a different light. As Mr. Odell so aptly said last night, believe that our annual State Fair is the best education for the youn men and the young women of Nebraska that can be obtained any where within the state in so short a space of time. It is the very center and circumference of good citizenship, and today there is as much danger of it becoming a liability as an asset, if we canno make it an inspiration to the American youth. We want to say to our representatives and senators that we want on our Fair ground where thousands of people go every year a building which will b a credit to agricultural Nebraska in which we can show the products of the state. At our State Fair large numbers receive their firs idea of the dignity of farming and the value of farm products There is a good deal of talk about this "back to the farm" movemen nowadays, but there would not be such a thing if people had proper respect and a proper idea of the dignity of farming and wer properly inspired to live the agricultural life. We don't want t take up the matter of this bill with our representatives in a hall hearted manner, but as though we were asking only for what w are entitled to; and we want to impress upon them the importanc of what we are asking, not only for this Board but for the entir State of Nebraska. It seems to me that we cannot measure th importance of this agricultural movement in this state, nor educat ing and interesting the youth so that they will like to live upon th farm. I have not a great deal of sympathy with this "back to th farm" reform cry. I think in all reform work if the foundation is righ no reform would be necessary. It will take care of itself. The sam thing holds good in regard to farm work. We must have the inspira tion for farming and farm life, and when we have that we will no have to cry "back to the farm." Usually the fellows who ar agitating this movement are those who have failed in every othe kind of business and there isn't anything else they can do but go back to the farm; but that is just exactly the kind of people that we do not want upon our Nebraska farms. They are men who do not understand the soil, or how get the best out of it, and who will not do the work for the work's sake. We do not want any of these failures out in our Nebraska agricultural fields. Let them stay in the cities where they belong. President Haws: There is a motion before the house. You e heard the motion made by Mr. Graff that we take up the matter the date of the Denver Livestock Show and see if it cannot be tnged so it will not conflict with this meeting of the State Board Agriculture. Are there any remarks? </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Secretary Mellor: Mr. President, if I may take a few min utes, I would like to say that the State Board of Agriculture has had this up with the Denver Livestock Show. As you all know the date for the meeting of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture is set by Statutes and we could not change it no matter how murl we might desire to do so. The only way a change could be made would be by an act of the legislature. We have repeatedly appealec to the Denver Livestock Show and asked them to change their dat so that our people could go out there, too. One year they did chang it, but that was the only time they have ever consented to do so and it just happened that year that on account of weather con ditions or other reasons none of our people went to Denver, guess they concluded there was not much use changing the dat as they didn't get anyone from Nebraska anyway. I am perfectly willing to take it up with them and will do so at once, but I feel perfectly sure that they will not take any action on the matter. I think three years ago they held their meeting one week before our annual meeting but since that time we have never been able to get them to change it. That is the way the matter stands at the present time. I do not believe that it will do us a bit of good to take it up so long as the management is under Mr. Johnson, for I don't think that he will consent to make any change in the date whatever; however, it will do no harm for us to try it and I will be glad to write him again on the matter. t President Haws: You have all heard the motion that the •etary be instructed to write the manager of the Denver Livestock w and ask him to change his date from the third week in January t will not conflict with the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ting at Lincoln. This, as the Secretary has explained, we must 1 according to the statutes, the third week in January. All in &gt;r of the motion make it manifest by saying AYE. Contrary, NO. The Ayes have it; the motion prevails. I President Haws: I feel a good deal like Mr. Mellor has just , that it won't do any good to take the matter up with Mr. nson, but at least we can try it. I President Haws: Is there anything further that you want to g up at this meeting? This is your meeting, you understand, and are the people to run it. t Secretary Mellor: We have a few calendars left if anyone ts one. I tried to send one out to each of you, but if any one missed, we would be glad to have you take a calendar with you. would like to have one of these in every business house in the b. If any of you would like to take a half-dozen or so with you would be glad to let you have them. There are also some 1912 1 books here on the table. If any of you want one of those just e up and help yourself. Secretary Mellor: I hope as many of you as possibly can be at the Dean Bessey banquet tonight at the Lincoln- Hotel. </seg>

ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE BANQUET I Held at Lincoln Hotel, Wednesday evening, January 22, 1913, 7:00 P. M.,. given in honor of Dean Charles E. Bessey, Univer - ' of Nebraska. tW. R. Mellor: We have gathered here tonight to show our reciation of one of Nebraska's honored citizens, which incidentally reflect upon his loving helpmeet. It is but just and proper that should have one of his friends to preside, therefore I take pleasure introducing to you another of Nebraska's honored citizens — the stmaster of the evening, Mr. S. C. Bassett. tS. C. Bassett: The author of Ben Hur makes this observation, st question all experiences in life are useful." This is my first Hence as toastmaster on an occasion of this kind and I am dering if the experience will prove useful to either you or me. This is a meeting of Organized Agriculture, a meeting composed of representatives of some twenty Nebraska state organizations allied to agriculture, and before we begin the real purpose of the gathering let me say that in October last our State University sent </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tairy stock judging team to the National Dairy Show at Chicago, compete with some fourteen like teams sent by state universities [ colleges for prizes offered for the team scoring highest in the ging of dairy cattle. Our Nebraska team was victorious, carry - off first honors in the contest and bringing home, as trophies se beautiful cups which grace the tables on this occasion. (Point - to the cups.) As this is the only joint meeting of organized agriculture held during this week we ask the privilege of calling attention to the trophies won by the team and to present to you Mr. Wisenand, a member of the team who will tell you how they did it. I take pleasure in presenting to you Mr. Wisenand. Mr. Wisenand: Mr. Toastmaster, Dean Bessey, ladies and gentlemen: This is naturally a little bit embarrassing and especially so since it is my maiden appearance. I realize that I am expected to be on exhibition along with the rest of the trophies. I confess that I am pretty nervous right now. As soon as I found out that I was to be called upon to make a talk I went around and talked to all the old experienced ones as to what I should say. I talked with all the old stagers and their advice was to keep cool. That reminds me of the time we were at Chicago on our contest. Pro - fessor Frandsen, who is one of the exponents of this "keep cool" business, was there with us and the night the results of the contest were announced he was so cool that he walked the streets of Chicago until 3 o'clock in the morning and stopped about every half block to shake hands with himself and congratulate himself. That is his idea of the way to keep cool. You want me to tell you about my experience in winning these cups at Chicago. There really is not very much to tell. It was decided last fall that we would send an exhibit and enter the contest at Chicago from the State Farm, and I was one of the lucky three chosen to enter the contest. There were representatives from four - teen other agricultural colleges. Professor Frandsen went with us. We visited the Waterloo Dairy Show on the way and then we went to Milwaukee and visited their show there, then came back to Chicago. Professor Frandsen made us eat all our meals at the Y. M. C. A. and kept a close watch on us in every way. There was one thing in Milwaukee that I couldn't quite understand — the agricultural school there is located in a little suburb, a town not to exceed a hundred inhabitants, and some, of the students took a good many mysterious walks into Milwaukee. But so far as we boys were concerned we were kept under strict surveillance. I guess they weren't going to take any chances on our not being able to enter the contest. When we got back to Chicago we stopped at the Palmer House and went to bed early that night so that we would get a good rest. The next morning we were up at eight o'clock and went out to the show to enter the contest. There were forty-two members divided </seg>
            <seg id="p153">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 153 in four equal divisions. Each was placed in charge of his own sec tion boss or gang foreman. It was this man's particular and specia duty to see that we did not communicate with each other. We didn't speak from about 8:30 to 4:30 or 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon There were seven classes, and four dairy cows. We spent fifteen minutes in passing on each class and then we had to give abou fifteen reasons. That was about all there was to the contest. Ther were three judges chosen by the dairy institute. The three judge passed upon the cows themselves separately, not conversing wit each other. They didn't allow the cows to talk any more than the did the boys. Then they graded and judged them by their worth It took the judges all day, and I suppose they worked some at nigh too, but I am not sure about that. They got everything in shape and on Saturday night we went to the big pavilion and heard th results of the contest announced. Naturally, I did not expect t get anything. The states were read out in alphabetical order. The went through the states and down to Nebraska. Of course we were all interested and pricked up our ears to listen. When they said Nebraska first, we nearly had a fit. When they couldn't say the name of the man I knew it must be me for no one ever could pronounce my name. You see we won three very good cups and came very near winning another. We are very grateful to the members of the dairy association who helped to defray our expenses. We hope they will help us again next year, and we will go over there and try to win out some more cups. I think the dairy department did this judging on the individual merits and on nothing else, and without bragging about ur dairy department I think ours outranks any in the United States. I hope to see the day when Nebraska will outstrip and out - rank any other state in the Union in the matter of dairy products. I thank you. (Cheers.) Toastmaster Bassett: We are all proud of our Nebraska I As we have been sitting at the tables some time, in order rest ourselves for a few minutes we will all rise and sing two ses of "America," the School of Agriculture quartette leading. tMR.

He was then called to Iowa icultural College at Ames where he remained for fifteen years, established in that college its department of botany and gave the college its motto "Science with Practice." He was one of founders of that great institution of learning and helped to lay the grounds and plant trees an 1 sDrubs ton its campus of some 10 acres. I In the year 1884 Professor Bessey was invited to come to Ne - ska as a member of the faculty of our State University, serving dean of the agricultural college and having in charge the depart - nt of botany. (Many of you cannot realize how pitifully small we were as a versity at that date. When Professor Bessey came to our state begin his work in our university I am told there was not so much a microscope in the nature of equipment in the botanical labora- IWhen Professor Bessey entered Michigan College it was with intention of fitting himself for the profession of civil engineer. t While pursuing his college course he developed such a love for iny and seemed so admirably fitted for teaching that he was •d to become a teacher of botany rather than a civil engineer, this he finally decided to do. When he thus announced his ntion the President of the college is said to have remarked, ell Bessey, I am glad of it, but you will never be rich." tEven presidents of colleges are sometimes mistaken, for Dean ey is now one of the richest men in our state today, rich in all things which make life worth the living. A few toasts have been arranged for this occasion. We are all well aware that these are busy days for the chief executive of our state and we greatly appreciate his kindness in consenting to be with us even for a brief time on this occasion. While he has had no time for preparation I will venture to assign him the toast, "The Relation of the State to Agricultural Develop - ment", and I have the pleasure of presenting to you Governor John H. Morehead. IGov. John H. Morehead: Dean Bessey, Mr. Toastmaster, lies and Gentlemen: You do not know how deeply I appreciate at the toastmaster has already said in regard to an apology for i as I need it. I was asked to come up and make a little talk you, and I feel tonight very particularly like the little boy whose tructor told him to prepare a little descriptive history of Patrick nry, and I think my remarks will be about as brief as his. His irts were something like this — "Patrick Henry was a small boy, I light hair and blue eyes, was not very good looking, growed up, married, and then said 'Give me liberty or give me death.' " I it this is not embarrassing to my better half. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD PF AGRICULTURE 155 The subject I was to talk about tonight it seems, was something like this — "The relation of the State to Agriculture." I hardly know where to start, but I am sure I will know when to quit. I really have been very busy in this state for the past two or three weeks, but I feel that I have a great responsibility to perform in the state which has done so much for me. When I look over this audience, meeting people as I do, and seeing a well dressed and a well fed class of people (and we boast of our accomplishments) it is a question with me whether we have accomplished as much as our opportunities would justify. We are living in the great State of Nebraska, in as rich and productive a section of the country as there is in the world, and it is a question with me whether we have taken the precaution by law to preserve to the people the natural resources of this great country of ours. We should do something along this line now if we have overlooked this important factor in the past. We should look up and present laws at this session of the legislature which should take active part in preserving these great resources to the people of this state. We hear so much at the present time in regard to progressives and reactionaries. I believe this progres - sive talk is brought about by neglect, or by dishonest legisla - tion in this country. I believe the people have been sufficiently prosperous so that they have overlooked the importance of preserv - ing to the people these resources, and in consequence there are a great many of our natural resources in the country that have drifted or gotten into the hands of certain individuals, who have built up what we call in this country a great monopoly, owned nearly or entirely by certain corporations who give but little return to the people of this country. We boast of living in a republic, the greatest form of government on the face of the earth, but I believe we have overlooked a great many things when we should have looked after the resources of this country. I believe we can learn a great deal of what we should do by patterning after our Canadian neighbors here so close to us. I rind there the resources have been properly taken care of. Under a republican form of government we can accomplish great things in this country, but it does not necessarily mean that because it is a republican form of government it is a good government. It may be good, or it may be bad. It is good if the people are intelligent and capable of self government and take an active part in seeing that laws are passed in this countiy that are for the good of this country. I think we have a good example when we look at Mexico. They live there now as they did four hundred years ago. Why? Because the people- are not capable of self government. We find we are progressing more rapidly and living better in this country because the people are more intelligent. I say, therefore, that we should look after the laws passed and see that they are for preserving to the people of this state its natural re - sources. We have a number of streams running through this state and we should look well to them, and see they do not get into the hands </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of corporations. I do not say this state should develop all these re - sources, but I do say that we should see that our rights are pro - tected; if farmed out to the corporations we should see they do not control them, so that the people reap no benefit of our great re - sources. Our legislature is now in session, and it behooves the people of this state to take an interest in our work. We can progress, we can pass a great many laws here that will be beneficial to the people, but we should not say we have accomplished all there is to accom - plish. We have made changes, many of which have been good. We could name some of them. I believe there is a ten - dency to bring this government back closer to the people. I believe we are inclined to give the people a fair and square deal. We could mention some of the laws that have been passed in this state along the line of regulation of the railroads. I believe the abolition of the pass is a good thing. I believe we are getting men in the legislature who are not influenced by such things as passes; therefore I believe we do a great deal of good in getting laws passed in the interest of the people. In connection with the passes I am going to make mention of a story I heard at one time. Some gentleman was riding on the B. &amp; M. road when the conductor came along and asked him for his ticket. He presented him with a pass. The conductor looked at him and asked — "Are you a rail - road employee?" He says — "I guess so, I am in the Nebraska Legislature." As I was saying, a great many laws have been passed, many of which are giving the people greater freedom, thus bringing the government back closer to the people. I trust that our action this winter will demonstrate to the people of this state the "Relation of the State to Agriculture, that we are demonstrating more plainly and more forcibly than I can tell it here tonight. However, we have met here tonight to do honor to one of Nebraska's distinguished citizens. Dean Bessey is perhaps as well known as any man in the State of Nebraska. He perhaps has been instrumental in doing as much good as any man in our state. Our toastmaster referred to the progress our University has made since Dean Bessey has been one of the factors in this great institution. Judging by his looks, he has many years of usefulness yet. We trust from a selfish reason as well as our good wishes to him that he may continue to do a great deal of good along the same line that he has been working so long, and I believe I voice the unanimous sentiment of this crowd of people with us. and perhaps of all, when I say to him that we wish him many years of activity, and assure him that he has the best wishes of the people of this great state. "The University," Chancellor Samuel Avery responding: Chancellor Avery: Before beginning my speech on the versity and Dr. Bessey's relation to it, I want to extend just §ord of greeting on the part of the Kansas Board of Agriculture, ch I had the honor to address not long ago. I want to speak of great work done in Kansas by the Board of Agriculture there </seg>
            <seg id="p157">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 157 under the splendid leadership of Mr. Coburn. He has done more than any other one man to make the name of Kansas known all over the United States. I attended a meeting down there not long ago, and a lady Chairman presided over the meeting. I think it was the first time I have ever had the honor of having a lady in - troduce me at a meeting of that kind, and it was an agricultural meeting too, so that you see things are moving down in Kansas. I must tell a little joke on this lady in connection with this meeting, and I will have to ask of the ladies present their pardon in advance. In introducing me to the audience, this lady said " The next speaker will be a very distinguished gentleman," then she couldn't find my name on the program and became a little bit embarrassed. One gentleman reached over and whispered my name to her and that relieved the strain, and she went on and made the introduction. When I got up I told Dr. Claxton's story, as that incident reminded me of it. The colored people were holding a meeting to raise funds for a colored institution and a Colonel presiding at the meeting was introducing the orator of the evening, and said, "The orator of this evening is known throughout the width and breadth of this county, more than that, throughout the entire state, known in fact all over the United States; nay, more than that he is a welcome visitor at the Court of England, and when he came to the name of the speaker, he leaned over and said, 'Say, what is that nigger's name'?" (Laughter.) I My subject is the University. One of your distinguished repre - tatives, I believe it was Brother Odell, wrote to me about it [ emphasized very particularly that he wanted the talk confined five minutes. He said I could publish all I pleased, but I must talk over five minutes, so I am limited. Not very long ago ing the co d snap a commercial traveller went to the hotel land - 1 and said — "Can you fix me out with a good cold room?" ou bet your life, that's what I specialize in." So you will see ' way I will get through in five minutes, and I think the pre - tion a very wise one. I" Dean Bessey and the University of Nebraska." My first Election was coupled with the announcement that Dean Bessey i to speak at the agricultural meeting, and that was one of the igs that called me there. The first time I entered the University Nebraska as a student I put my head up to a little window and nd a gentleman with little grey whiskers, who was our own Dean «ey. The University of Nebraska without Dean Bessey would like a tragedy, Denmark without Hamlet. Dean Bessey reminds in actual flesh and blood of one of the heroes of the old time mces. In my studies of early sciences was Trieska, the three es great. Dear Bessey who has done more for the University Nebraska than any other man in the state; Dean Bessey who nded our botanical department; Dean Bessey who has carried the greatest amount of the research work that has been done in </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE t University; Dean Bessey who has come in personal contac more students and the faculty and more in contact with th le of the state than any other man connected with the Univer or who has ever been connected with it. I would like to pro a toast then tonight to Bessey Trieska, three times great rising, responded to the toast.) "The School," State Superintendent James E. Delzell respond- Jas. E. Delzell: I, like the Chancellor, just a short time ago, two or three days ago, Mr. Odell called upon me and said — "I have placed you down for a short talk on the schools, and in honor to Dean Bessey, and I want a very short talk." I assured him it would be that. Twenty-one years ago I attended the State Teachers' Association and Dean Bessey addressed the regular session irt the evening. I took down the outline of that talk and I have it yet, part of it in my head, the rest of it on paper where I can get it when I want it. I was more impressed with that session of the meeting of the State Teachers' Association than any other session that I ever attended. It made an impression on my life that stayed with me and was a help to me throughout my school work in the town schools. The next direct contact I had with the Professor was when I was out in the sandhills teaching in the high school. I found a little plant, I did not know what it was, I could not analyze it. I sent it back to Dr. Bessey to write the botanical name and then the common name, and when the report came back to me he said at the close, "It's a very pretty little flower." You don't know how that last impressed me with the kindly thought he had for that little flower. I thought, surely that man has a kindly thought for all the students that are with him. Then again, when I went to Lexington to take charge of a school there, about the first thing I heard in connection with the University was that Dr. Bessey gave the commencement address there; and during the time I was there I think we have not had a commencement address that one of those students, who heard Dr. Bessey, would not some time or other during that time say to me — "This does not come up to the meeting when we had Dr. Bessey." He left the impression there that he was a man that loved all people. While I have been sitting here this evening the thought has come to me — men may come and men may go, but Dean Bessey goes on forever, and that is quite true. He has left an impress on the schools of the State of Nebraska that will continue while Nebraska lasts as a state; and this impression is that life is worth giving all you have for others, and to help others and not to look out for No. 1. In all my relations with Dr. Bessey in the twenty years that I have heard him speak, and when I have visited with him, I have never heard him speak an unkind word of any one; if he talked about anyone it was to say something good, and I believe if we will follow his example and say good things about other people it will come back to us and we will have friends </seg>
            <seg id="p159">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 159 twill love us. Dr. Bessey is our friend, and friends all over the love him; and Dr. Bessey, I assure you that love will follow throughout all eternity. 1"The Home," Mrs. Frances D. Keefe, President, Nebraska me Economics Association responding. Mrs. Keefe: We have a just pride in the schools and in th institutions of our state, but it seems to me that everything tha has been said tonight emphasizes the importance of the schools i the State of Nebraska; and when we say that we are proud because we have the lowest percentage of illiteracy of any state in the Undo we do not put so much credit on the school system as on the men an&lt; women who had the courage and endured the hardships in comin to this prairie state to establish their homes and develop thei schools. Everything that has been said has emphasized the fact tha it has been the personality of those who came and those who fo lowed. The home with ideals means more to a state than any o the societies of the state. Nothing else ranks with it, because th home centers around the child, from there it goes out to other chile ren, and again and again the circle goes on, so that to the home must come everything with which we have to deal tonight. The old idea of the home might apply perhaps in the rural districts more strictly than any place else, as being the home of the individual, and the home of the individual has been merged more and more into a horn which is not bounded by the four walls of our own house and door step, but the home which extends into the town, the city, the state and the nation. The influence of the father and the mother in th home does not end there, they only begin to do the things whic their duty calls for. There is a story told of a man and a woman He was a very ordinary man and she was a very ordinary woman They married and lived in the ordinary way. She was a good hom maker, he was a good provider. One night he came home. Th lady had company. He heard her talk about her servants. After the company was gone he said, " My dear, don't you know it is not at all polite to be talking about your maid?" "All right," said she, "I will not do it again." A night or two later when he came home he heard her telling some company about her children. " Why, my dear, don't you know that nobody wants to hear you talk abou your children. Everyone is interested in their own. They don't wan you to talk about yours." "Well, I won't do it any more." Anothe time when he came in she was talking to another friend about he clothes, and he was very much disgusted. He told her it was vulga to talk about her clothes and said, "Can't you find something t talk about except your clothes?" She promised not to do so again Another time when he came home he found her talking with som friends about her husband. He reproved her very severely. Th next time he came home he found her sitting on the floor stringing beads. Her home was bounded by her servants, her clothes, her children, and her husband. The home today, as I have said before, </seg>

The home of the future must be ne which extends into the state and into the nation. Then, ma ay, here's to the future home of Nebraska. May it have all th •essary comforts, but not the luxuries. May it lead to plai ng and high thinking, and may the men and women who ar fathers and mothers of these homes leave behind them sue mples as have our honored guests tonight. I "The Agricultural Interests," Regent George Coupland respond- Mr. Coupland: Ladies and Gentlemen: It gives me a special pleasure tonight to be permitted to respond to the toast that has been assigned to me. I am especially gratified to be permitted to respond on behalf of the great agricultural interests of Nebraska; and the sweetest pleasure to me is to be able to congratulate two of the dearest friends that I have in this world. Dr. Bessey is known the world over. He does not merely belong to Nebraska, bu belongs to the world. Three years ago it was my pleasure to attem the British association for the advancement of science. They me in Winchester, and speaking there with a friend of mine from th old country where I was born, we were talking about Dean Bessey It delighted me to hear him spoken of in this way. Dear old Dr Bessey! Away over the seas he has the affection of the eastern world; he is looked upon as belonging to them, but in a big sense he belongs to Nebraska. Without question Dr. Bessey has done more for the material upbuilding of this great state of ours, which is so peculiarly agricultural, than any man has done, and in addition to that he has woven that winning personality that is so peculiarly his, right into the heart of the people. He is, shall I say, woven into the woof of this Nebraska of ours; he is a part of us. I believe that the peculiar trait of character that has been referred to by my friend Delzell accounts for this. I have heard it said, and I believe it is absolutely true, that Dr. Bessey never had a bad student. Dr. Bessey never had one, he never discovered any bad students in any of his classes, and I noticed it very particularly. Two or three years ago I was attending a scientific association when one of his old pupils who had attained a very high degree of eminence — they were both on the program lecturing, and every once in a while this former pupil would say — " Mr. Coupland, isn't he fine, isn't he fine." After awhile it would become the Doctor's time to lecture, and then the other fellow would make a remark — "Why, the Doctor gets better all the time, doesn't he?" That is the kind of impress that Dr. Bessey has left upon the student life with whom he has come in contact, that is the personal equation of this splendid man's character, the ability to impress his own loving, winsome person- </seg>
            <seg id="p161">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 161 ality on those who come under his influence. Now in addition to that, when we look at the wider range as pertains to this state's material well-being and think what this man has been to this state, why we cannot begin to estimate in dollars and cents the worth that he has been to our agricultural interests. Our agricultural interests are practically all that we have, and this good soul recog - nized very early in his school life that the useful things in life had the germ of the highest sort of collateral in them. Those are the men, tha type of men who have been the force in this nation of ours, that have given us the idea that we want usefulness linked up with our educational system. And thus, through the fight that has been going on in Nebraska to give the idea of agricultural educa - tion the noble conception it should have, has largely been due to the efforts of our good friend here, this eminent scientist who has recog - nized that his effort along these lines has been worth so much. Every one of these students who has come under his influence has left the class room impressed with the idea that not merely should they have that knowledge to add to their personal enjoyment from a cultured side, but what they have gathered in the class room should be made of use to others. I do not know of a more splendid conception of what education should be; and as I have the privilege to speak on behalf of our agricultural interests here in Nebraska I want to thank this good friend of ours that he has been such a forceful spirit behind this movement, that he has had in view all the time the fact that we needed educated men upon the soil. There are some very eminent school men who have not yet, or only recently gained that vision; that is, that we can use everything that the schools have to give upon the land. It delighted my heart to hear this noble man once say to me that the best cultural course that the University had to offer its students was to be found in the agri - cultural college. I want you to remember that we can use the highest culture, we can use the best expert knowledge and the most keen and acute expert knowledge upon the farm, and that we have in such spirits as this the assistance to gain what we so much need. I could not help but think as I sat at the end of the table here tonight, that like the plants which this eminent scientist has studied, through the long years, which draw their virtue from the great King of daylight, so he has drawn from the great sources of Divine knowledge and power that he has diffused among those who have come under his influence. I think that the great poet philosopher who penned these beautiful words that I shall quote to you: as she looked over the divide she caught a vision of such spirits as these when she said, in the "Choir Invisible:" "Oh, may I join the choir invisible Of those immortal dead who live again In minds made better by their presence: live In pulses stirred to generosity, 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In deeds of daring rectitude, in scorn Of miserable aims that end with self, In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars, And with their mild persistence urge men's minds To vaster issues. So to live is heaven. May I reach that purest heaven, be to other souls The cup of strength in some great agony, Enkindle generous ardor, feed pure love, Beget the smiles that have no cruelty, Be the sweet presence of a good diffused, And in diffusion evermore intense! So shall I join the choir invisible Whose music is the gladness of the world.' The Live Stock Interests," Honorable William Ernst respond- ing Hon. Wm. Ernst: Our Distinguished Guest of Honor, Ladies and Gentlemen: In the development of our great State of Nebraska live stock has been a most important factor. We have passed the age, if you please, of the buffalo, the broncho, and the cowboy. Many of us lemember the rumbling and thundering of the thousands of buffalo moving across our state from their summer pastures to their winter quarters farther south, or vice versa. The animals could be heard hours before the advance guard came in sight and long after the last straggler had disappeared. The buffalo has gone, never to return, but it would not surprise me if the bull moose would sweep this country in less than four years from now. Next came the Texas longhorn to take the place of the bison, but he also had to give way to a more improved animal, the scrub cow. For a time it was a profitable business to own scrub cattle, the more the better. How could it have been otherwise when Uncle Sam furnished us free pasture, or when we used the land belonging to the eastern land speculator without any compensation whatever, and whom we regarded as a trespasser when his agent wanted us to pay the taxes on the land for the privilege of pasturing the same? We thought it to be our sacred duty to have our herds eat the first green blade showing up in the early spring and keep the grass down all through the growing season so nothing would remain to protect the roots the following winter. As a result the weeds took the place of the native grass and consequently later our thin beeves sold at starvation prices. While this thoughtless and ruinous destruction of our native grass was going on, and long before the herder had realized what he was doing, a man of science had set to work in an untiring, unerring </seg>
            <seg id="p163">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 163 way to correct and remedy our work of devastation. I have refer - ence to our distinguished guest of honor, Dr. Charles E. Bessey. The tame pastures of our farms, of which much mention has been made by the agricultural papers and on which prominent members of the agricultural department of the State University have complimented us, are nothing more and nothing less than the result of the work and study of Dr. Bessey. We simply planted the grasses and legumes he recommended, and planted them in a manner prescribed by that gentleman. He is the man who taught us how to grow two blades of grass where we had previously grown but one. I reverently bow my head to this great and good man, and thank him in the name of the Nebraska live stock growers for his great service. But while talking thus, my scrub cow has gotten away, never to return. The fullblooded cow, the registered horse, the thorough - bred hog and sheep have taken the places of the inferior animals which have gone on and which satisfied in the days of long ago. The thoroughbred is the only kind of live stock a progressive farmer can afford to own, and while they in themselves are a source of pleasure and profit, they have a much greater mission to perform. They will be the means of restoring our mistreated, worn land to its original fertility. The next generation of this country will be called upon to feed twice the number of our present population, and all that will be necessary to enable them to perform this task will be to have the agricultural leaders follow in the footsteps of our distinguished guest of honor. I thank you. "The Agricultural Press," Lieutenant Governor Samuel Roy McKelvie responding. Mr. S. R. McKelvie: I am very glad the toastmaster rectified the impression he was about to leave as to my age. Now as we get to this part of the program, what I shall say has no reference to Dean Bessey. I am reminded of a trip I made to Washington in company with Mrs. McKelvie. We visited Arlington cemetery where many prominent generals are laid to rest. We were guided by a colored man. He pointed out the different resting places of these famous generals, and finally we got off into the place where the monuments were not so large and the graves not so well kept. I asked, "Who are these?" "I do not know, I guess these are the odds and ends." I feel like Chauncey Depew said to a friend of his, "Jonah was glad when the whale swallowed him, and when asked why, said because he knew when the banquet was over he would not have to make a speech." I hope you will pardon these few jokes of mine, I consider this a time for joyousness when we can gather at the banquet board and have with us our beloved friends and </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE guests, Dean and Mrs. Bessey, those friends who have contributed so much to our material welfare and our social happiness. I have been asked to talk on the subject of the "Agricultural Press." Don't you know, Mr. Odell, that was a dangerous thing to do? It seems impossible for me to start out here and say anything that would be in proportion to the subject which I am given to handle, The Agricultural Press. I believe I am only fair when I say it is the greatest factor in connection with our future, because it goes as a messenger of light, carried into the thousands of homes in our lands. I want to praise Dean Bessey because of his unselfish - ness, because he was not thinking of the material things, but was thinking of how he might get into the hands of the people in the most useful way the things he had discovered. Dean Bessey did not wait for me or those who were earlier in the publishing business than I have been; he did not wait for these to call for assistance. When he found the things that the people should know he went out and gave them those facts gratis, unselfishly. The earliest recollection I have of Dean Bessey is when he was connected with those live stock conventions which my father attended, and I remem - ber well when father came home he would talk so tenderly and so kindly of Dean Bessey. In my education I feel that there was something missed, and that is instruction under Dean Bessey. I feel that I have been extremely unfortunate in never being connected with him. I am glad to liken Dean Bessey to the plants and flowers with which he has had to deal. He is as natural as they are and his character is as beautiful. S. C. Bassett: My friends, it is now my great pleasure to present to you one of the great educators of the world, our loved and esteemed friend, our honored guest, Doctor Charles Edwin Bessey. Dean Charles E. Bessey: How can I thank you? As I sat here while you were saying these undeserved but very kindly things about me, I wondered what I could say that would convey to you something of the feeling that I have. I do not know how to do it, but let me assure you that if I have done anything to please you I am very glad indeed, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this expression that you have given me so generously. But I do not want to talk about myself. One reason, men and women, why it has been possible for me to do what I have done is the kind of community in which I have worked all these years. Let me emphasize this thought by telling you a little story of how I came to Nebraska, which I think I have never told to a Nebraska audience. More than twenty-eight years ago, one day while at work in Ames College, Iowa, I received a letter from the Chancellor of the University, saying that I had been elected professor in this University, professor of botany. At the same time I received a communication of similar import from Sec - retary Dales, Secretary of the Regents then as now. I had not known </seg>
            <seg id="p165">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 165 that a botany professor was wanted in Nebraska. My election came to me as a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. I talked with my wife about it. We had never seen Lincoln; we had seen very little of Nebraska. I wondered very much what the University was like, 10 I wrote a temporizing letter to the Chancellor. In a few days I came to look the ground over, and I found absolutely nothing in botany or agriculture. After looking over the campus with its one poor building, and finding nothing in it in the way of botany, and then on going out to the Farm, and finding what it was and what it was not, I said — " You are not ready for me yet." And so I de - clined the position. A few weeks later Mr. Gere (whom some of you remember as the long time editor of the State Journal), then Presi - dent of the Board of Regents, telegraphed me saying — "If I come over to Ames with a new proposition will you consider it?" Of course I answered that I would, and so he came; and under a big maple tree in front of my house on the campus at Ames we talked the whole matter over again. He put the larger outlook before me, and the result of the conference under the old tree was an agreement that I would come to Nebraska at the end of the semester in No - vember, 1884, to be Professor of Botany and Dean of the Industrial College. So I came, and I have never been sorry that I did so. The community which is ready to consider new ideas is the com - munity in which a man may grow. I do not know what I should do if I found myself in a community as former Chancellor Canfield once did after leaving Nebraska, where people said he must be shal - low because he talked on so many subjects. In this good state a man is not condemned simply because of his much speaking, nor because his plans are new. That is the kind of a community in which to grow up. It helps one; it does not repress him. And so I am glad, and have always been glad, that I came to this sympathetic com - munity, and I am especially glad tonight that I came to such a com - munity at that period of my life. I But I see that I am down on the program for a response, and seems to me that a good way for me to make a proper response to look into the future along the lines that have been taken up those who have preceded me on the various toasts. And so for few minutes I am going to play the part of a prophet. I The "Agricultural Interests" of the state, spoken of by Regent upland, are paramount, and must always be paramount in a te like this, which has no mines and no forests. We have the I, however, and we have the water, and we still have the rains 1 the winds which bring the free air and the sunshine, and these the things that make our crops in the fields, the like of which ave never seen elsewhere, and which bring such prosperity as is plainly evidence in this auditorium tonight. The "Live Stock Interests" iken of by Mr. Ernst, are intimately connected with the foregoing, these same crops are and always must be for the feeding of tie and hogs and horses and sheep and poultry. The great range </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE country of nearly one-half of this state, with its irrigated fields — I cannot see any limit to what that part of the state may do. For there will be milk and butter and cheese and honey, and all the good hings that come from the animals that we raise. And what will the state do for agriculture to help its development? Following the suggestion made by the Governor in his address this evening, and during the reception before dinner, I may promise that the state is going to help in the fuller development of agriculture along all lines; it is going to help us in one way and another to save our soil. It is a wonderful soil, but it is not a soil which can be abused continually. The state must step in soon and help us save our soil. It must not wait until tomorrow; it should do it this year; and so too, it should help save the waters of the state. Why should not this session of the legislature undertake to save the waters of the state to be the heritage of the people, and not the property of cor - porations? Let us save today these waters for the future, and then let the state help us in the use of the waters. So also, it must help us in the way of marketing our products, and it must help us by securing for all of us pure seeds and pure foods. These are many ways by which the state may help agriculture. And then the homes of the future — I want to speak about them. They will be all that Mrs. Keefe has pictured them, and more. We all like a comfortable house for a home, but the comfortable house is not all. It must have trees. I grew up in a region where there were trees; my play time was always spent in the forest. I loved to get into the woods, I loved to get out where the sun streamed down through the tree tops, and I still like these things. The future homes of this state will all be homes with trees about them, and shrubs and perennial flowers, and singing birds, and better than all — the romping children. What a wonderful life there is on the farm! I was a farm boy and I remember the farm animals not as just cattle, and horses, and colts, etc., but I remember them as individuals. We knew their individual peculiarities as well as the individual peculiarities of our friends. This one was all kind - ness; this one would actually play jokes on you; that one was sly; that one was surly. All this, and much more, pertains to the country home. And leading to and from this home there should be good roads devoid of mud and mire. So there will be good country roads in the future, and good books too, and again children — bless their little souls. And the Agricultural Press spoken of by the Lieutenant Gover - nor, what of it? What papers will come to these homes? What papers will be permitted to come to the children in these rural homes? As I look into the future I see clearly that there is going to be a change in the papers that come to the homes. Today we have the great dailies, and we read them daily. We get our news out of the dailies seven days a week, and once a week we get the agricultural paper, and it is all agriculture and has no news. In the </seg>
            <seg id="p167">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 167 future this thing is going to be different. The agricultural paper will be a daily paper, and it will give us agricultural reading as now, and also bring to us the news of the world. It will not be devoted to telling all about revolting crimes and the petty details of politics and intrigues, and all that. I can see a place for a daily paper which shall be a newspaper in which other things shall be emphasized than those which we now call news. Why should I be bothered with the fact that fifteen hundred miles away some petty crime has been committed? Why must I pay for the news that such and such a man was divorced from his wife? Give me rather, something that I am interested in, as well as others like me, and that the people on the farm are interested in. Tell of present world history, of the great movements and tendencies. And this is coming — the agricultural paper of the future, that comes into the family home, the rural home of the future, will be a daily paper full of real news, not scandal and gossip; and it will have a literary flavor too. I believe in that. What comes into the home should be of the best. Then with this literary flavor it will have the breath of the country with its pure air and clear skies. What of the Rural School of which Mr. Delzell spoke? I have a vision whose realization is yet perhaps a long way off. It is a vision of the rural school as a home — not a desolate building that is vacant for sixteen hours of the day, and for a great many weeks in the year. It is not going to be vacant in the future, but it will be a home with people living in the school home, and these people who live in the school home are to be the teachers of the children, in that happy time that is coming. There will be then one home, the school home, in the district where children get instruction. And people are going to live there twelve months in the year. The door of the school home will be open every week in the year, and every week day in the whole year. Now when this comes it is going to work a revolution, but it will be a wholesome revolution. This school home will be on five or ten or more acres of ground, good ground — not the waste of the district by any means — but good ground, good soil, rich soil, and on it will be plenty of trees, and flowers, and shrubs, flower beds, and gardens. And this is going to settle this whole question of agricultural educe tion in the public schools. I know that the realization of this vision is a good way off, but it is going to be accomplished some day. I hope I may live to see the beginning of it, but at any rate, some of you or your children will see this thing as a reality. This school home will be the home of the neighborhood library. We shall put it in the school home, and make that so much more the central home of the com - munity. And last, I have a vision of "The University" of which the Chancellor spoke. How many of you have read in the original charter that was drawn up more than forty-four years ago the paragraph that states the object of the university? Let me read </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE it to you — "The object of such institution shall be to afford to the inhabitants of this state the means for acquiring a thorough knowl - edge of the various branches of literature, science and the arts." It is a most wonderful charter. The University is for "the in - habitants" of Nebraska. It does not say "for the young people," it does not say "the young men," or anything like that, but "the inhabitants of this state"; and it is for the purpose of securing "a thorough knowledge," not a smattering. And then, "a thorough knowledge of literature, science and the arts," and then further as though that was not enough, it specifies "the various branches" of these. That spreads it over every application of science that you can possibly think of; that is what has made it possible for us to build the kind of institution we have in the University of Nebraska. Now I have had a vision of the University as it is to be in the future, and this is the vision that has come to me in my study again and again: A cluster of stately buildings with green grass between them, and clear sky over them. Who was it, Huxley I think, who advised the John Hopkins trustees when that institution was dedicated, saying to them, "Be sure to get your men, be sure to get the rooms for these men to work in. You can have brick - layers make the rooms you want." But he did not stop there; he said further: "Then when you have all these provided for, and you have some money left, get an architect to plan a great edifice which shall be an inspiration to the people." Nebraska is now rich enough to begin its stately buildings. So I see more clearly my vision of the University of Nebfaska with stately buildings, and with trees and shrubs and flowers on its campus, and clear air and the quiet that should go with study; not in the midst of the clatter of street cars or the roar of the passing trains; and with five thous - and and more students, five hundred and more teachers, these five thousand students being "the inhabitants of the state" who are acquiring "a thorough knowledge of literature, science and the arts." These young men, some of whom are going to be farmers, and some of whom are going to be mechanics, some merchants, some lawyers, some authors, and some teachers, some stock men, etc., will mingle together and touch elbows, and know what they are mutually think - ing of, so that when they go to their several places and begin their life work they will know what manner of men are in other occupa - tions. The man destined for the country life, and the man destined for the city life will sit side by side in the class room, and work side by side in the laboratory; each one will help the other; the literary man will become more practical, and the practical man will become more literary. This is what the University should do, and it will do it if we develop it aright. This, my friends, is the vision that I have for the future of the University; the University made as large as the wording of its charter, the University which will fully serve this good and great community that we call Nebraska.

            <seg id="p169">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 169 A USEFUL MAN AND SOME OF HIS METHODS By S. C. Bassett It is not the purpose in this sketch to give in full any measure of the usefulness of doubtless the most useful man in the history of our state, but rather to relate, in a brief manner, something of the methods which enabled him to become so useful and helpful to the people of our state and nation. Charles Edwin Bessey was born on a farm in north central Ohio, May 21, 1845. Of his ancestry the father was French, the mother German. It appears the Besses' (as originally spelled) were Hugenots who fled to England to avoid persecution, and later came to America about 1750 and settled near Philadelphia. The father of the subject of this sketch was a most successful teacher even after he settled upon his farm in Ohio, he having re - ceived a classical academic education and being especially strong in Latin, Greek and mathematics. Charles Edwin Bessey received his early schooling in the country schools of Ohio, followed by advanced work in two local academies; at the age of eighteen years he began teaching in the public schools, first in Ohio and later in Michigan. When twenty-one years of age he entered Michigan agricultural college, graduating at the age of twenty-four. It is related that when he left the home in Ohio for Michigan his mother's advice was "Charles, wherever you are be one of the people of that community; act as though you intended to live there always and make yourself so useful that they cannot spare you." That this advice, this method of usefulness, has in largest measure possible been lived up to thousands of loving friends can gladly, truthfully testify. Of his methods while a student at Michigan agricultural college permit me to quote Doctor A. J. Cook of Pomona college, California, who was another member of the faculty of Michigan agricultural college at the date when Charles Edwin Bessey was a student; Doctor Cook says: "Professor Charles E. Bessey was my pupil for three years, 1867-8-9; he was one of the most thorough, painstaking and accurate students that it has been my pleasure to teach in all the forty years of my college work. I remember a very hard problem, the 'skew arch' in engineering, which most teachers skip as too difficult for any use, was given Professor Bessey's class; he alone solved it and the first day handed in a very complete solution with paper models that made it very plain to all. He was especially fond of the sciences, but was equally thorough in all his studies. He was a very hard student of languages and his proficiency in these has served him and others to excellent purpose all these years." At home on his father's farm Professor Bessey grew up to think that money-getting was of secondary importance and that it was more important that our lives be lived honorably, industriously and </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE helpfully. When he entered college it was with the intention of fitting himself for his profession of civil engineer and surveyor, but in his studies he was so thorough, showed such a genius for original research, such an aptitude for teaching, that the president and pro - fessors advised a specializing in botany with a view to making that a life work. That advice was not at the first accepted, but later finding that his inclination had changed from engineering to botany. Professor Bessey so informed the president, who, it is related, re - marked: "Well, Bessey, I am glad of it, but you'll never be rich," and a little later, "Yes, I'm glad of it, but you'll never be rich." Graduating from Michigan agricultural college, Professor Bessey became a member of the faculty of Iowa agricultural college and one of its founders. Of his methods of usefulness at that college permit me to quote W. H. Wynn, Ph. D., D. D. of Tacoma, Wash. Doctor Wynn says: "I was associated with Doctor Bessey for thirteen years or longer, in the faculty of Iowa agricultural college, where I found him on my arrival there in the year 1871. He was just then from Michigan agricultural college and was beginning his career as specialist in botany and as one of the founders of that institution of learning. Our personal intimacy through all those years was so close that I was enabled to observe and sympathize with the stages of his develop - ment as a scientific man, and as an educator, as perhaps no other could. I have to say of him that he comes as near the ideal college pro - fessor as any one I have ever known through an experience in this line of effort for over thirty years. He seemed to be a man of science to the manner born, taking almost naturally to the kind of mental habit which is essential to success in that line of work. By that I mean that he had in large measure the indefatigable industry, and unwearied patience, necessary to make research fruitful, but espec - ially the peculiar aptitude for that sort of research that we are disposed to call genius, and that it was, inciting me to think that he did not have to plod on through the laborious processes of experi - ment to get his ideal in hand. The consequence was that he soon came to have a national reputation as a botanist and no less as a skilled lecturer both in the classroom and in the larger field of public life. To all which he added a charming personality, an attractive element in which was his unfailing vivacity and enthusiasm of utter - ance. * * * Having said this much of his rank as a scientific man and educator I must add that, with the single exception of President Welch, no man in connection with the college, in the formative period of its history, did so much toward shaping the scope and char - acter of the college, as did Professor Bessey. "He supplied it with its motto, 'Science with practice,' which determined its curriculum and inspired its methods for all time to come." In the briefest manner possible, Professor Bessey's methods of usefulness while at Iowa agricultural college, a period of fifteen </seg>
            <seg id="p171">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 171 rrs, can be stated as follows: He built up the department of botany that it took first rank among botanical departments of colleges and universities in the United States; he took active part in the meetings of the Iowa horticultural society, the agricultural society, the state teachers' association and the Iowa academy of science; he wrote for the Iowa agricultural press, telling how to plant and what to plant — telling about weeds and grasses; attended state fairs and made horticultural and botanical exhibits; helped to lay out the walks and drives on the college campus and to plant hun - dreds of plants and trees. At Ames, la., he joined a local church (Baptist), and it might be here added that at Lincoln he joined the Congregational church, and, in both places, helped to build their new church buildings, taught in the Sunday school and now and then in the absence of the regular pastor gave pulpit addresses. While in Iowa he was a loyal Iowan, standing up for Iowa institutions and ideals. In the year 1884 Professor Bessey was induced to come to Nebraska and undertake the work of building up the college of agriculture and more especially the department of botany in the University of Nebraska. It can be said that the department of botany in the University of Nebraska, at that date, had not so much as a miscroscope in the nature of equipment for a botanical labora - tory. Possibly the real inducement which led Professor Bessey to leave the well equipped botanical department of the Iowa agricul - tural college and come to Nebraska was that he was made dean of the agricultural college, thus enlarging his sphere of usefulness. The writer lecalls that after severeal years' connection with the Nebraska university, when it became known that Professor Bessey had been tendered a position in the faculty of one of the oldest and most renowned colleges in our country at more than double the salary he was then receiving, and on his being asked what satisfactory reason he could give for not accepting so flattering an offer, a posi - tion he was so admirably fitted to fill, Professor Bessey's reply in substance was that his position with the University of Nebraska permitted him to do much more original research work than would be possible were he to accept the position offered, and that he felt he could be more useful to remain in Nebraska than to go elsewhere. On leaving Iowa and coming to Nebraska, Professor Bessey followed one of the fixed methods of his career: He ceased to be an Iowan and became at once a loyal Nebraskan; he ceased to be a member of Iowa agricultural and scientific societies or to subscribe for or contribute to the press of Iowa; he ceased to take Iowa news - papers and subscribed for like papers published in Nebraska; he also followed the methods before mentioned of contributing to the Nebraska press as he had before of contributing to the press of One of the first duties devolving upon Professor Bessey as dean of the agricultural college was to recommend for appointment a pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p172">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 172 fessor of agriculture. Owing to the limited means for payment of his salary the person must be a young man, but before making a recommendation Professor Bessey made a journey to a distant state in order to meet the prospective professor (H. H. Wing) in his own home, the home of his parents, in order that no mistake might be made in filling so important a position in our college of agriculture. The methods employed by Professor Bessey that he might be useful to the people of Nebraska began immediately on his arrival. He became a charter member of the Nebraska dairymen's associa - tion which was organized almost simultaneously with his coming to the state; he took an active interest in the work of the state board of agriculture, state horticultural society, state teachers' association, improved stock breeders' association and kindred societies, attending the meetings and reading papers on timely topics. In co-operation with farmers and ranchmen he began a collection of native plants and grasses of the state, and for years, previous to the opening of the annual state fair, spent days in arranging, classifying and naming the native grasses exhibited for competition, such exhibits forming an important feature of the fair and for which liberal premiums were offered. He traveled extensively over the state delivering lectures at farmers' institutes and county fairs, in order to become acquainted with the people, the plant life, both native and cultivated, the climatic conditions and soils, in order that he might be better informed and more useful in advising as to plants and methods to be used in developing the agricultural resources of the state. In the year 1885 Professor Bessey was appointed scientist of the board of agriculture and since that date has furnished sixteen reports on "Grasses and Forage Plants of Nebraska, Native and Cultivated," "Conditions Affecting Agriculture in the State," "The Forests, Grasses and Fungi of the Great Plains and Conditions Governing Their Distribution," "Relationship of the Natural Plant Families," "Migration of the Bull Pine and Other Trees" — all original research and investigation. These reports cover six hundred pages in the published annual reports of the state board of agriculture and much of the information thus gained is embraced in published text books in use in public schools and colleges. Without question Professor Bessey's most successful method of usefulness has been in his great work connected with his classes in botany in our university where, yearly, he has met intimately hun - dreds and ultimately thousands of young people from all parts of the state. To these young people he taught not only botany but he counseled with them on all sorts of subjects. In this way he has come to know and be known by some 10,000 of our young people with the result that wherever in our state there is a gathering of our people, whether it be directly in' the interests of education or in the development of the resources of the state or for the betterment of the condition of mankind, the mention of the name of Professor Betsey brings from such an audience a quick recognition of love and appreciation.

            <seg id="p173">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 173 (Recently in looking over a list of some 125 former students of &gt;fessor Bessey who have shown a continued interest in botany, many cases members of faculties in the greatest universities and leges in our land, others in the service of the United States govern - nt, it was of marked interest to note how wide is the distribution these former students. The list is too long for publication in this tch, but mention is here given of their location and the number those most prominent in each state or location given: tNew York, five; Massachusetts, one; Indiana, two; Maine, Ohio, two; California, five; South Dakota, one; Illinois, three; hington, three; Nebraska, twenty; Arizona, four; Minnesota, s; Michigan, three; Louisiana, two; West Virginia, one; louri, one; Colorado, three; Kansas, three; Vermont, one; •onsin, two; New Mexico, one; Idaho, one; North Dakota, one; h Carolina, one; Iowa, two; Texas, one; Alabama, one; Oregon, Wyoming, one; Philippine Islands, three; Porto Rico, one; aiian territory, one; United States department of agriculture, teen. When Professor Bessey came to Nebraska there was very little of definite knowledge of the native plants and grasses of the state, or in fact of the land beyond the Missouri of which Nebraska is a part; and as before stated Professor Bessey began a systematic investigation of these plants and grasses and of their usefulness, and as he added to his collection of specimens he kept many duplicates of the more important and useful and when, after a few years, students of his in our university began to teach botany in our high schools he loaned to such students and teachers slides for use under the microscope of specimens of the plants and grasses thus collected by him and thus greatly enlarged his sphere of usefulness. tit was at the suggestion of Professor Bessey that the act denning purposes of United States experiment stations was so broadened its scope as to make more useful the work of these stations to people and to the cause of agriculture. I When in the 1895 session of the legislature an attempt was mad establish a grand boulevard through the so-called "state farm, ending the same to University Place, and to plat the farm int r lots that the state might receive a financial benefit in the sal the lots, it was Professor Bessey who came to the rescue in th empt to rob the university of its most valuable educational asset 1 caused the defeat of the measure. It was our own Professor Bessey who worded so wisely and well the bill introduced into our state legislature in the year 1901, and which became the first act passed by a state legislature providing for the teaching of agriculture in rural, graded and normal schools; and it was our own Professor Bessey, assisted by Professor Lawrence Bruner and Professor G. D. Swezey, all of the University of Ne - braska, who prepared the copy for "New Elementary Agriculture," the first text book of its kind and for the purpose intended ever published in the United States. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">174 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I Professor Bessey served as acting chancellor of the Nebraska versity 1888-91, 1899-1900 and in 1907, and as head dean since 9; he has been requested and urged on more than one occasion accept the position and honor of the chancellorship, but declined ause he believed he could be of greater usefulness to the univer - t and to the state in his own chosen profession. Doubtless, many who know of this eminent man, this man who for more than a quarter of a century has been so useful to the state, this man who takes such high rank as an educator and scientist, think or believe that he has been furnished by the state all needed help and equipment in the prosecution of his researches, such as a well furnished office room, well equipped laboratories, abundant, convenient, up-to-date filing cases for the many specimens which he has so patiently, so carefully and bo laboriously gathered these many years and which are of such great scientific value, and yet quite the reverse is true. Professor Bessey has been handicapped at all times for lack of necessary office room as well as lack of equip - ment necessary for the prosecution of his work to the best advantage: and in comparison it might be said that there is no office for a state officer in our capitol building but what is more luxuriously furnished, has more of the necessities and conveniences for the transaction of the business of the public than has had from the beginning in 1885 to the present date that of Professor Bessey. It has been one of the fixed methods of our esteemed friend to uncomplainingly make the best possible use of the means and facilities furnished for the prosecution of his labors. As a method of wider usefulness Professor Bessey has been a member of many state and national societies, scientific and educa - tional in character; it is not necessary, in this article, to name them, for those interested may find a quite complete list in "American Men of Science" and in "Who's Who in America." A few of the number are here named, and also the names of some of the works of which Professor Bessey is the author: He is author of Geography of Iowa, 1876; Botany for High Schools and Colleges, 1880; the Essentials of Botany, 1884; Elementary Bo - tanical Exercises, 1892; New Elementary Agriculture, 1903; Ele - mentary Botany, 1904; Plant Migration Studies, 1905; Synopsis of Plant Phyla, 1907; Outlines of Plant Phyla, 1909, 1911, 1912. Of the more prominent societies Professor Bessey was president of the botanical society of America, 1895-6; president of society for the promotion of agricultural science, 1889-91; president of the depart - ment of natural science of the national educational association, 1895-6; president American association for the advancement of science, 1910-1912; of this last named association, during the last sixty years the names of practically all the leaders of American science have been on the registry of the association.

I do not desire to go into the detailed method of chposin these helpers, believing that the Board of Managers, if it deem this suggestion worthy of consideration, is amply able to determin the method of selecting them. In support of the proposition, how ever, I desire to say that the bringing in of boys from out in the state would not only improve the service at the Fair, but would in many instances redound to the benefit of the county fairs over the state. At the last fair we employed something over forty helpers in the Amphitheater. Most of these came from the City of Lincoln. Had these boys come from forty counties we would have advertised the State Fair more thoroughly in those counties, and in return would have sent the same boys home materially benefited by their experience. I If this system could be well worked out by your honorable body 1 help secured in this manner, not only for the Amphitheater, bu the various departments of the Fair, it would without question alt in great benefit both to the State and County Fairs, and be untold value to the young men who are fortunate enough to be icted. I would recommend the securing of cheap caps for the ushers, each cap to be labeled "USHER", and would insist that they be worn continually while the ushers are on duty. I find that an occasional usher will hide his badge to avoid work after the crowd </seg>
            <seg id="p180">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 180 is pretty well in and it is therefore hard to locate him. A distinctive cap would increase the efficiency of the service. II would suggest that the seat check on the Amphitheater ticket 1913 bear a bold, distinctive number. This will materially aid in cting those who persist in using the same check a second time, •h I found was sometimes done by persons who were not pleased i the location of their seats and would present their old checks, se numbers should run consecutively. For instance, all tickets Monday afternoon should be numbered "1" in bold figure, all i for Monday night should be numbered "2", and so on. In rush and in the dim light of the evening this will greatly facilitate work and avoid mix-ups. The box seat checks should not call any special chair, but should read "Good for any chair in box 1", and so on. I found trouble in several cases which this em would eliminate. I The system of exchanging bleacher tickets for tickets in the phitheater can be made more efficient by placing a man with ets in each bleacher, who will be on the ground and doing iness when the ticket sales first commence. If this is well worked fill increase the revenue on days when the Amphitheater is not d. II would most strongly recommend that some provision be made shut off the sun at the west end of the Amphitheater. During latter part of the afternoon it is almost impossible to hold the pie in their right seats in sections "M" and "N". tl would recommend that two or three announcers be placed : distance from the Amphitheater, telling the people that the ; are in progress and directing them to the Amphitheater. Quite »;r cent of the people are strangers on the grounds and wander essly about, not knowing where to go next. This will, no doubt, several hundred dollars to the revenue if thoroughly worked. ■ I believe the service at the Amphitheater can be improved in following particulars: L Keeping the people off the front steps leading to the Amphi - ter. Keeping the people out of the aisles. Keeping the band stand clear of spectators. Keeping stragglers from the unoccupied boxes. K Keeping the people from hanging onto the fences in front of Amphitheater and the bleachers. A better organized force at the various entrances to the Amphi - theater and bleachers with a view to having every man at his post before the ticket sales commence, thus reducing the liability of congestion at gates. More rigid rules for the government of the boys who peddle and spill lemonade on the general public. More thorough cleaning of the Amphitheater. Providing of boxes at each stair landing to place the dirt and rubbish in, thus making it more easily disposed of. </seg>
            <seg id="p181">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 181 These things can be accomplished by more thorough and explicit instructions to the ushers and helpers. These, gentlemen of the Board, are the suggestions that have come to my mind after the experience gained during the last Fair. In conclusion I wish to express my appreciation of the kindness and courtesy extended to me by the officers and members of the Board, and to assure you that I stand ready at all times to aid in anything that will advance the best interests of the State Fair of Nebraska. Respectfully submitted, E. R. Purcell, Superintendent. REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF PRESS Mr. W. R. Mellor, Secretaiy: IAs Superintendent of Newspapers of the late State Fair, permit to submit the following report: Hhile my duties as superintendent were not very closely definec issibly not as well understood as they should have been, yet erstood, the work related to the agricultural press largely ant ed in part in issuing free admissions to a limited number o ntatives of such press, including reporters, editors and solicitors &gt;scriptions, and assigning free locations for tent headquarters se locations for those soliciting subscriptions. t There were thirty-two publications of an agricultural nature rented at the Fair, to whom 145 admission tags were issued to whom twenty-two location permits were issued, these location iits not including tent locations used for headquarters. In the attempt to limit the number of admissions of any one paper it developed that parties carried credentials, showing that they represented not one but several publications; it also developed that these subscription solicitors were not interested in the Fair, nor in advertising the Fair, but solely in securing subscriptions to their respective papers, for which it further developed that they received as commissions as high as 85% of the subscription price received. All kinds of inducements — such as premiums and prizes — were offered and in some cases forced upon individuals as inducements to them to subscribe, and your superintendent is of the opinion that sub - scriptions thus secured are of no real benefit to the newspaper securing them, nor to the State Fair, nor the cause of agriculture, and that it is not wise, expedient or desirable that the State Board of Agriculture lend its encouragement thereto by furnishing free admissions to subscription solicitors, or free locations on the Fair grounds to be used for such purposes. tYour superintendent recommends that in the future soliciting criptions for any and alt newspapers be classed as a concession, </seg>

Your superintendent is of the opinion that it is advisable and desirable that the courtesies of the State Board of Agriculture be extended to editors of the state press and to editorial writers (reporters) of the leading agricultural press of this and other states, and that free tent space be granted to leading agricultural journals where they may meet their patrons and friends and wherf — in such tent — they may receive subscriptions and advertisements.

Gibbon, Nebraska, November 1, 1912. REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF SANITATION To Officers and Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, K Gentlemen: Your Superintendent of Sanitation begs leave to mit the following ieport: I This work was new to me, but I did the best I could under the umstances. As I did not have men to do the detail work, the den of that fell to me. This work requires a great deal of close ntion to detail and I found that it kept me busy from morning night visiting restaurants and refreshment stands. Whenever I id conditions different from what they should be, I called the 'ntion of the proprietors to those conditions, stating that they it be remedied. Some of them disliked this, but no trouble arose. I was on my rounds of inspection I made note of the garbage ch was not hauled away and would report these matters to the tractor. I gave close attention to the toilets, to see that they e kept in as sanitary condition as possible under the crowded ditions. I beg leave to make the following suggestions: tl. That all concessionaires be given a number corresponding the number of their contract, this number to be displayed on front of their place of business. 2. That Article 9 of the contracts designate size of numbers and letters to be used in signs and bills of fare. t3. That the toilets under the grandstand be remodeled into &gt; compartments, these toilets to be used by the grandstand rons only, that a new toilet be built south or southwest of the ndstand to accommodate the masses that congregate in that section ike grounds, that another toilet be built near the poultry and ry buildings. 4. That there be installed two sinks under the grandstand into which sinks the concessionaires could empty waste water. </seg>
            <seg id="p183">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 183 5. That a sewer be run from the dairy building to carry away waite water from that building. This is of particular importance, as the waste water flowing over the ground to the west of this building causes discomfort to those camping there. 6. That alleyways be left for the removal of garbage, thus saving time and labor. 17. That a penalty be imposed on the garbage contractor, if a tract is made, for every barrel or box of refuse that is not hauled ly by 8:30 A. M. each day. t8. That all employees working in this department be under the rvision of the superintendent, and that the superintendent have quarters located in some convenient place so that employees report and receive their instructions. Yours very truly, J. H. Taylor, Superintendent. REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF CLASS "A"— HORSES Gentlemen of the State Board of Agriculture, I will submit the following report: While there were about the same number of horses as last year tshow in some classes was the best ever put up at our State Fair, judge, Professor W.

Kennedy, said the aged Percheron mare class was the best he had ever seen at a State Fair, and it was tW show than nine out of the twelve international shows — and I ve they were all owned in Nebraska. The Shetland pony show fully as large again as last year. Everything passed off smoothly; I did not hear a single kick from any of the exhibitors.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF CLASS "B"— CATTLE To the Officers and Managers, Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, Gentlemen: In the following you will find my repoft as superintendent of Class "B" for the year 1912: There were ; 494 head of exhibition cattle in the barn.^divided into th« breeds as follows: Shorthorns, 75; Hereford, 93; Aber- </seg>
            <seg id="p185">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 185 deen Angus, 24; Galloway, 26; Polled Durhams, 56; Red Polls, 56; Holsteins, 89; Jerseys, 47; and Guernseys, 28. The sum total of $690.00 was collected in stall rent. Shorthorns This breed was represented by: Ho well Reese &amp; Son of Pilger, Nebraska; Owen Kane of Wisner, Nebraska; Johnston &amp; Cannon, Holdrege, Nebraska; Rapp Bros, of St. Edwards, Nebraska; Retzleff Bros, of Bennett, Nebraska; R. B. Baird of Central City, Nebraska; C. A. Saunders of Manilla, Iowa; D. Tietjen of Bellevue, Iowa; C. S. Nevius of Chiles, Kansas, and Bellows Bros, of Maryville, I Bellows Bros, won the grand champion on bulls with their bull mond Goods, while Owen Kane won the junior championship in is with a yearling calf that was a credit to the show. It can be i in looking over the awards, that the Nebraska exhibitors carried the large end of the winnings, which should be quite an encourage - lt to them to come again next year. The two year old heifer, let Goods, owned by Howell Reese &amp; Son, was again the grand mpion of the breed in females, she winning this same honor last r. Taking the class as a whole, the Shorthorns made a very iitable showing, and I think with better prospects next year for er priced feed, and better pastures that the Shorthorn show will le back to where it used to be. Hereford* tThis breed was represented by: 0. E. Green, Genoa, Nebraska; mpson Bros, of West Point, Nebraska; E. H. Gifford, Lewiston, raska; J. P. Cudahy, Belton, Missouri; E. M. Cassidy &amp; Son, ting, Iowa; O. S. Gibbons, Atlantic, Iowa; R. H. Hazelett, Dorado, Kansas; Hann &amp; Mayne, Harlan, Iowa; Klaus Bros., dena, Kansas. tThe grand champions were all awarded to Mr. Cudahy; and I h to say, that he had as nice a herd of Herefords as I have seen the Nebraska State Fair grounds for the past five years. If I lember correctly he won the blue in every class that he showed, h the exception of two. The Nebraska exhibitors' herds were ter than usual and showed careful breeding and proper fitting. Aberdeen- An (us In this class we found just two herds, those of A. C. Binnie &amp; Son of Alta, Iowa, and W. A. McHenry of Dennison, Iowa. It was a royal fight all the way through, with McHenry getting a little the best of it in the awards; but the quality of both herds would be a credit to any show. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Galloways Here again we find this breed represented by just two herds, and both from Nebraska, Straub Bros, of Avoca, and A. O. Huff of Arcadia. On account of the delay of Mr. Huff in getting here from the Des Moines fair — he not arriving until Wednesday morning — I found it to the best advantage to have this class passed upon at the barn instead of making Mr. Huff lead his tired and travel worn animals over to the Coliseum. And right here I want to say, that I think it would be a good idea for the Board to take such matters as this up with the railroads, as I can see no just cause for such a Polled Durham* tWe find this breed well represented, both in numbers and in ity, and it seems that this breed is gaining ground every year, ibitors were: Walker Bros., Ord, Nebraska; L. T. Fredericks, nphis, Nebraska; John Ketterrer, Bethany, Nebraska; J. H. er, Peru, Indiana; Achenbach Bros., Washington, Kansas, and Stegelin, Straight Creek, Kansas. I Mr. Miller seemed to have a little the best herd all the way ugh, and managed to carry off the bulk of the blues, and both npionships. Red Poll* The largest and I think the best Red Polled show that was eve on the Nebraska State Fair grounds was represented by Fran! Davis &amp; Sons, of Hoi brook, Nebraska; Haussler Bros, of Holbrook Nebraska; T. L. Leanord of Beaver Crossing, Nebraska; Chas Graff of Bancroft, Nebraska; Wm. Borwege of Bladen, Nebraska Alex Buschow of Blue Hill, Nebraska. Here we find the blues and championships pretty well distributed, which shows that no one man had the advantage, and that Nebraska is coming to the front, as this show was made up entirely of Nebraska breeders. Holstein* Passing the beef breeds and coming to the dairies we find great show. The Holsteins had the greatest number of animals in the barn, with the exception of the Herefords. We found here the herds of Badger &amp; Frost of Central City, Nebraska; T. A. Gierens of Walton, Nebraska; Frank White &amp; Son of Hampton, Iowa; Iowana Farms of Davenport, Iowa; R. C. Marshall of Lincoln, Nebraska; H. E. Capron of Lincoln, Nebraska, and C. J. Platt of Red Cloud, Nebraska. »The ribbons were pretty equally divided in this class, and the y point of note here was the fact that Badger &amp; Frost were able beat the bull owned by the Iowana Farms for the grand cham- </seg>

Jerseys tThe usual three herds made up this part of the show, they f owned by Smith &amp; Roberts of Beatrice, H. C. Young of sin, and J. A. Reedy of Lincoln. Guernseys I We had here a new breed. They were well represented by cox and Stubbs of Des Moines, Iowa, and I think that a great ly visitors took quite an interest in them. Judges tMr. Geo. H. White of Emerson, Iowa, handled the Shorthorns Polled Durhams, and did his selecting in a very creditable ner, there being no complaints that I heard of. tMr. Robert D. Mousel of Cambridge, Nebraska, gave very good action in the Hereford classes, as did Mr. Chas. Escher, Jr. of a, Iowa, on the Blacks. bMr. Howard Gramlich, who passed upon the Red Polls, had a task, but I understand gave better satisfaction than did the Poll judge the week before at Des Moines. I Prof. A. L. Haecker found quite a dairy show to his liking and i very loud in his praise of the quality as well as the quantity the show. The exhibitors were all satisfied with his placings as as I could learn. Fat Cattle tThe steer classes were not as full as they have been in the past, I think those who did exhibit were well satisfied, both with the liums and the places they drew. The South Omaha Specials These were won on the best bull as follows: Shorthorn bull owned by Bellows Bros., £ first. Hereford bull owned by J. P. Cudahy, second. Angus bull owned by W. A. McHenry, third. Best Cow Hereford cow owned by J. P. Cudahy, first. Shorthorn cow owned by Howell Reese &amp; Son, second. Angus cow owned by W. A. McHenry' third. Best Calf Herd Angus owned by W. A.

No third steer shown. I In dosing I wish to say, that the clerical work was handled by r of us, one less than has been the custom. The employees, . J. L. Heald as assistant superintendent, and Mr. Eric Wright, I Mr. Jno. Dirks as clerks, were all competent help, and I found mistakes on any of them. I think that the secretary, Mr. Mellor, . vouch for the reports that were turned in at the end of the w as being all completed this year. tThe water supply was very satisfactory this year, and we did have to use the supply tanks that the Board had put in, in of emergency. There was very little complaint from the cattle this year, and I tried to handle all such as came up without lering the Board, as I realized that they had enough to do at best. To show best the feeling that existed this year, you have to look back at the parade on Friday morning, when there were ty-nine . head of cattle out, and we could have had more if ndants could have been secured to lead them. ■ As to recommendations, I will leave that until I make a report the revision committee this winter. tl want to thank the officers and the Board of Managers for the dence and trust that was bestowed upon me this year, and that I have fulfilled my part to their satisfaction. Yours very truly, E. R. Danielson, Superintendent. Osceola, Nebraska, September 11, 1912. REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF CLASS "C"— SWINE To the Board of Managers of the Nebraska State Fair, Gentlemen: I beg leave to submit the following report The exhibition of swine at the late Fair was almost a record breaker — there were 1,827 "hogs in the pens, against 1,831, the high mark. The different breeds were represented as follows: Duroc Jerseys, 887; Poland Chinas, 552; Chester Whites, 181; Hampshires, 156; Berkshires, 42, and Mulefoots, 9. The Duroc show had some of the best animals I have ever seen on our grounds, but more young stuff was in the pens than in many former years — some of it might be called trashy. The Poland show was extra good — never has been better. The 1,000-pound hog was in evidence, one weighing an even 1,000 and one 1,010, — the first hogs ever on the grounds that the owner claimed to be a 1,000-pound hog and expressed any </seg>
            <seg id="p189">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 189 Engness to weigh. The Cheaters were a very good lot, but no •ovement over other years. The Hampshires were in some les better than in former years. Only one good herd of Berk - •s. This herd I think was the best ever shown at our Fair. I would recommend that the barns be partially floored over the pens, making a good place to store all feed and buckets which have always been in the alleys; if the alleys were all clear of feed and other obstructions it would be much more convenient for visitors, and would look much better. I would recommend that the Board have the pens thoroughly cleaned no later than Wednesday before the Fair opens, and that the firm contracted with to disinfect be required to go over the pens on Thursday before any hogs arrive. The Parke-Davis people gave us the best service this year we have ever had. I would recommend that, if possible, the judges be secured in time to have their names printed in the premium list and designate what breed each judge is to pass on. I think it is necessary to have three judges in order to get the work done in the time it should be done. I Your premium ribbons this year were the best we ever had. ould respectfully ask the incoming Board to continue the same em of printing the premium ribbons. Respectfully submitted. L. W.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF CLASS "E"— POULTRY To the Honorable Secretary and Board of Managers of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, i Gentlemen: As per requirements I heiewith hand you my ual report of Class "E" (poultry) for the year 1912. Never since my connection with the poultry exhibitions at the State Fair has so wondeiful an exhibition been held as the one of 1912. I Not only was the exhibition wonderful in size, but in quality well, for with very few exceptions every specimen exhibited was good quality and was worthy of a place in any poultry show. s condition is due a great deal, I think, to the exhibitor ticket tern, as it keeps that quality of stuff that has no show to win &gt; is a disgrace to the show room at home. Before this rule was &gt;pted inferior birds were brought to the Fair, just to get a free ;et to the grounds. I While this was a wonderful exhibition it was sadly lacking in i thing, and that was in the cooping system; we have simply to have uniform coops if we wish to keep in the lead or even with our neighboring states, for nearly every state fair surrounding is equipped with uniform cooping, and many of the county fairs this state have their own coops. It not only adds wonderfully the appearance of the exhibition, but enables the exhibitors to get ir birds to and from the grounds in better shape and with less *nse. t While this year's poultry exhibiti6n was very large it was the class to be finished in the judging, and as far as I could learn work of the judge was perfectly satisfactory, as not a single plaint came to me; quite a number of birds were lost or died r leaving the grounds, but in every case it was the fault of ;r the delivery company or the express companies, and the ess companies have already paid several claims for their care - iess. II would like to suggest that the doors on the poultry building thoroughly examined .and so fixed that they may be opened and «d at will; they are in such a condition at present that when impting to open or close them they leave the track and it requires </seg>

After the building was crowded and packed full, and exhibits of some counties placed in the aisles, there was still large quantities of perishable exhibits of agricultural products ch were sent to storage and were, of course, not displayed.

REPORT OF SUP'T CLASS "I"— BEES AND HONEY To the President, Secretary, and Board of Managers of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: Gentlemen: As superintendent of Class "I", bees and honey and apiarian products, I beg to submit my report as required by the laws of the association. A very great majority of the exhibitors in this class at the close of the Fair handed me the enclosed paper, requesting some slight changes in the premiums, or rather require - ments in premiums for this class in 1913, which I take pleasure in endorsing and recommending to your careful consideration. The honey show for 1912 was all that could be expected during a year in which drouth was so widely spread over the state. The ex - hibitions are showing that the area in which bees are gathering honey is moving westward at a very rapid rate. Large yields were shown at Neligh, in Antelope County, and at North Platte, in Lincoln County, </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE while two very excellent exhibits have for several years been put up by beekeepers residing at Cozad, Nebraska. The present honey building on the State Fair grounds is in a dilapidated condition, and it is no longer possible to protect exhibits or decorations from water running through a leaky roof during stormy weather. This building should be reshingled as soon as possible in order to save the floor, which would ordinarily last for many years, and which is being greatly damaged by water running through the roof in a great number of places without the opportunity to dry out quickly. tl do not think that we are needing a new honey house at this e. A new roof, or rather reshingling of the present roof, and ing 'the sides of the building on the inside from the shelving up the plate, this to be painted with at least two coats of oil and : or other material which will not turn yellow, or not scale off, lid be all the repairs needed in this department for several years come. It is quite a tax on the expenses of exhibitors in this artment to be compelled to purchase new muslin every year in er to place the building in shape so that their exhibits will show properly. Ceiling and painting white with some material whith will not turn yellow, will place it in a condition where it can be washed annually and be nice, clean and white, and it would be a farther protection against dust which blows through the walls at almost every fair. tl am under renewed obligations for the many courtesies shown, only ourselves, but the exhibitors in this department, by every ■ of the State Board, and am pleased to state that there has been a single exception to this general inclination to be courteous to aid as much as possible to make the exhibits in this class a ess.

Mellor, Secretary State Board of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska: I Dear Sir: Accompanying please find statement of the expenses conducting Class "L", educational, at the State Fair just closed. The exhibit in Class "L" this year was by far the most at - tractive and satisfactory that we have ever had. This exhibit is now just at the point where it must have better and more suitable quarters, so that it may have room to expand, or it will decline in point of size and quality. As matters now stand, schools which would make creditable showing cannot be urged to send exhibits because there is no room to care for them. If we cannot constantly add to the number of our exhibitors our department will cease to improve. The severe storm on the Saturday before the Fair opened so wrecked and strained the building, that the partitions were broken loose from the side walls and they are now attached to nothing but the floor. This makes the building most unsafe. It would seem that before another year a new building is absolutely imperative.

            <seg id="p228">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 228 LABOR SAVING IN THE HOME By Alice Loomis Women often are criticised for knowing better what they do not 'want than what they do want. Instead of deserving ridicule this condition should warrant a device to seek the cause of it. From the early civilized times and probably from a much earlier date, houses have been designed and built, and the furniture and other equipment made by people upon whom the responsibility of housekeeping did not fall. It is only very recently that women have had the opportunities that have led a few of them to become suc - cessful architects and inventors. That these opportunities, or at least the realization of them, is not universal, is shown by the interest usually attached to the statement, "That this or that useful article, or a successful scheme for the house is a woman's idea." In reality, what should be more natural? It all comes back to the patience rch ceased years ago to be a virtue, if it ever was one. Factories, laundries, stores, farmers, in fact all kinds of business Iw the desire to accomplish all that is possible by utilizing ma - nery and saving human labor. If this movement is not as promi - it in the house it is due to two reasons; first, that the house - per does not know that she can lighten her work; second, that does not know what to choose in order to accomplish this end; I third, that she cannot get what she wants. I firmly believe t if women knew exactly what they wanted they would get it, at least obtain more of it than when they know what they do not it. Only once in a life time does the average woman have the &gt;ortunity to plan a new house or to rebuild an old one. The t majority must take houses as they find them and make the t of them. Fortunately, even bad things wear out, and here is ere the opportunity comes in to replace the old with the new. which shall be more satisfactory. The floor in a room may be unsightly and therefore covered completely with a carpet. When the carpet is worn out the house - keeper must choose between rugs and a new floor or a carpet over the old floor. Carpets are harder to keep clean and free from moths than rugs. Almost every housekeeper will prefer rugs from the stand - point of attractiveness and saving of work in their care. The cost of the rug is less than that of the carpet but the stumbling block may be the new floor. Miss Bevier has given us some interesting figures on this problem. </seg>

Attractive ones 9 by 12 feet in two colors can be purchased for from $21 to $35. If it is impossible to hav a new floor laid the exposed part of the wood may be covered wit burlap or denim, but this is not as easy to keep clean as is the wooc With a dustless mop the flcor of the rcom can be kept in order with a few minutes' work each day. The mop costs about 75 cents am is used with an ordinary mop handle costing 50 cents. These dustless mops must not be confused with the mops on the market whic are filled with oil and make more dirt and labor than they ar worth. Carpet sweepers have been accepted as necessary by mos women so a description of them is unnecessary. The subject of th care of floors should not be left without mentioning sweeping com pounds. The woman who is willing to try new ways of doing he work is often the prey of unscrupulous or ignorant people who hav things to sell. Our grandmothers appreciated the need of dus preventives when they put moist tea leaves, coffee grounds, commo salt, or moist newspapers upon their rugs. While it is inconvenien to obtain these articles at all times the sweeping compound has bee prepared to meet this need. However, these compounds should b carefully tried before they are used upon the carpet. Some of them contain oil which gives a brighter appearance to the rug at firs but after a few months' use results in grease spots which hold th dirt and which are both unsightly and unclean. Before buying sweeping compound it is best to place a little upon a paper and see if it causes a grease spot.

            <seg id="p230">230 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Much of the labor of the traditional housecleaning would be avoided if the floor and walls could be cleaned frequently and easily. The vacuum cleaner will be a more general aid in the future than it is at present. Permanent installed systems are entirely satis - factory and can be used easily in isolated homes where there is a gasoline motor as in the city. The hand machines are sometimes difficult to operate and not always efficient. The traveling machines may carry dust, with its accompanying bacteria, from one house to another. It seems best not to use a vacuum cleaner unless one can have a system run by power for a single house, or houses where the conditions of health are well known. A simple and inexpensive way to clean walls is the use of an outing flannel bag over a broom. This bag should have a draw - string so that it can be removed quickly and washed. The feather duster is an unclean device which does not save time and has been almost universally condemned. The kitchen is the room in which the housekeeper without help spends more of her time than in any other one room. Even if there is help it is wasteful of money as well as time not to have the arrangement and choice of appliances which will allow work to be done most easily and quickly. If the kitchen is too large or poorly arranged much can often be done to improve it. A shelf can be put upon strong hinges so that it can be lowered when not in use. Such a shelf near the sink or stove will save many steps. A kitchen wagon on rollers can be made from an ordinaiy table costing $1.25. The drawers may be partitioned to hold various things, and the top may be covered with line. Pnufacturers and merchants knew that women are alive to wibility of choosing better utensils than they have used and the market is flooded with objects which will "make woman s work easy." Unfortunately few of them will stand the test of the three requirements of any piece of apparatus which is really worth while. First, the device must do as good or better work than can be done without it. It may take a short time to leatn to use it. The housekeeper cannot expect to have as good results with a new method as she is able to get with a method she has used for years. Bread mixers have been condemned by people who expected them to do in three minutes what it takes fifteen or twenty minutes to do otherwise. Ten minutes is about the least time which is sufficient to thoroughly mix it, and if a large enough machine is purchased, the turning of it will be easier than kneading for most people. Another advantage is that a willing person with no skill (men or boys) can use the bread mixer when he would not think of doing the kneading. The second requirement is that the device shall be simple and easy to operate and clean. Eggbeaters with numerous devices may beat eggs quickly but require twee as long to clean as a simple Dover or whisk. The larger size of </seg>
            <seg id="p231">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 231 utensil is easier to operate usually than the smaller one. The large size Dover eggbeater cost twenty-five to thirty cents and can be used as successfully in making a cake as a cake mixer and is easier to operate than a small size. Some of the devices on the market were evidently made with no thought of how they were to be cleaned. The third requirement, which is usually placed first, is the cost. The cost must include the durability as well as the purchasing price. Tin utensils are especially liable to wear out quickly if they are not heavily coated. A tin sieve purchased for ten cents will soon rust beneath when the tin is exposed to moisture, while one costing twenty cents may last indefinitely. Such a sieve which juct fits into the tea kettle makes an excellent improvised steamer for small articles such as stale cake or crusts of bread which have become too hard to slice. A cloth between the food prevents the food from too much moisture. An aluminum tea kettle, although costing $2.50, is not expensive because of its long life. Such tea kettles are now made with a flat top upon which a vessel can be placed, and a large spout. The kind of material of which a utensil is made has much to do with its satisfactory use. Glass is the ideal container. If no other bottles are available, fruit jars will do very well. How many busy housekeepers often open several tin cans before finding what they want. Labels are not as necessary on glass as -on other containers but if they are used a thin coating of varnish will make them permanent. The busy housekeeper with limited means is often at a loss to know what to choose among all the devices so well advertised. This is one of the places where the schools should help the homes. A domestic science equipment in the high school or the grades should provide the best which is possible in that place at a reasonable cost. If wisely used this will not make children dissatisfied with home but rather interest them in making their homes more convenient. In university work a student of Home Economics should have an oppor - tunity to try out equipment. A number of colleges have furnished practice cottages for this purpose where students live for short periods and learn something of the problem of equipping and manag - ing a home. It would be unfair to close this discussion without mentioning one great help to the housekeeper that is sure to come, and that is the general use of electricity or gasoline motors. Natur - ally they will be available in the houses only after they have been accepted as a necessary aid in farm work. In Germany where labor is cheap owners of farms even as small as fifty-two acres are manu - facturing electricity to run machinery, such as small threshing ma - chines managed by a few men, feed grinders and milk separators. On the prairies of Canada motors are recognized as the only possible help in solving the problem of farm labor. Iowa has issued a bulletin dealing with the installation of an electrical plant on farms. The amount necessary to light the house, run the washing machine, heat the flat irons, turn grinders, freeze ice cream, and turn the mangle, </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Email in comparison with that needed in operating the farm mt - iery. Gasoline engines are being used probably more generally 1 any other kind of farm motor. Here, too, the force can be made 'eat help in the house without much additional expense. I Making butter on the farm is much less general now than nty years ago because of the good price paid for cream by imeries. In at least two states the heavy laundry work is being ?n care of by the same agency. Laundries in connection with imeries are proving a great blessing to housekeepers, especially ners' wives in Minnesota and Kansas. It hardly needs to be said t the gasoline or other motor is used in common, and that the operations are entirely separate. i Neither electricity nor any other appliance, nor any numtfer of ices will ever make the material part of housekeeping all play, they can all help. The woman who knows definitely what she its and continues working toward it will have a house, the keep - of which is a pleasure and not drudgery. Then the housekeeper have more time in which to keep up the interest, for the lack which she is often blamed unjustly. With all the help possible n material things, housekeeping will take less time and the gain be in the greater amount of time for home-making. THE SHETLAND PONY By W. J. Thompson, Dorchester, Nebraska {Delivered Before Nebraska Horse Breeders Assn.) January 21, 1913 As you no doubt know, this is the first time that the Shetland pony has been represented at the Nebraska Horse Breeders' Associa - tion, but the reason we are here now is plain enough, if you will but think. Parcels post went into effect three weeks ago, and you need not be surprised any morning now if, on going to your mail box, you find a Shetland pony colt. Therefore, Mr. Gramlich thought a short talk on the pony would be in order. (The Shetland pony originated in the Shetland Isles, a group of e, rugged islands off the north coast of Scotland. Of all the breeds horses or ponies, the Shetland is the smallest, the gentlest, and most patient, he is very hardy and free from defects, can stand reat deal of neglect, is an easy keeper and a great rustler. One, even two, can be nicely kept on an ordinary lawn through the amer; in winter they require but one or two ears ot corn twice I lay, while a horse will need from five to ten ears three times a /. He is easily broken, is very companionable, and is recognized i world over as "the children's pany." He enters into their play, more contented when with them than when alone, and soon be- </seg>

The Shetland pony ranges in size from thirty-five to forty-six inches. The extreme limit allowed in England is forty-two inches but here in America our Shetland Pony Club allows a forty-six-inch limit. I do not believe any pure-bred Shetland will attain that height, however, and for children's use from thirty-eight to forty - two inches is the preferable size. The imported pony is of a more blocky build than those being bred on this side of the water; here we are breeding a little more for style and action. That, however, makes no difference so long as no cross-breeding is done. Many breeders have larger ponies in their herds because some want them Vith more size, but the Shetland has a distinct character of his own and anyone familiar with the breed can tell at a glance where cross - breeding has been done. tThey are strong enough to pull a pony rig on almost any kind a road and in almost any kind of weather (at least, when you lid care to be out), and for any reasonable distance. They wil vel as fast and as far as the average farm team. We have a ill pair of spotted mares (the ones we drove to the wheel in the r-in-hand at the fair last fall) that were driven from Dorcheste Fairmont (a distance of twenty-six miles) in less than half a day ey were hitched to a small carriage and were driven by two large r&amp;. The carriage and the boys weighed more than the ponies you think any draft team weighing say 2,400 pounds, could hau a 2,400-pound load twenty-five miles in less than half a day— and that in the middle of July, as hot and dry as it was last summer? I doubt it. tWe will now consider the child and the Shetland, as comparec h other pets. How many children are there of good sound mine body who do not crave some kind of a live animal for a pe friend? Some have dogs, some cats, and even a few have goats burros. Every farm should have a good collie dog; they are essity if you are to handle much stock. But no matter how in igent a dog you bought to start with, or how much trouble yo k in training it, you soon will have a dog that is of no use fo :k if it is used as a pet. Aside from the first cost (the purchase price) it will cost but little more to keep a pony than a dog. If a large dog is fed as it should be, and not allowed to forage for its food, it will cost nearly as much to feed as a pony. But aside from the food question is the danger of hydrophobia. How many times we have read of some member of the family being bitten and either dying or being rushed to the mad-stone! Can we afford to run this risk when we have an opportunity to get the child's pet, the Shetland? tAlso with the cats — they are a necessity around the barns and '-sheds, and the few quarts of milk they drink are well spent, it is cheaper to feed them than the mice and rats. Still as you </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 will all agree, it is seldom the petted house cat that catches the mice. But any reliable doctor will tell you that many disease germs are carried by a house-cat. Can we afford to have our children hold and pet and play with them when so easily we can get the pet of all pets for children, the Shetland pony? t Nearly every state in the union has a law for the prevention of ;lty to animals. It is one of the most commendable laws that we e, and it is a pity that it is not more rigidly enforced in a great ly places in the state. Still, driving a burro would make one ty of breaking that law. Did you ever notice any children driving urro? What were they doing — leading it, or standing up in the gy whipping it to make it keep up a slow walk? Of all the things now of that would spoil a child's disposition, I believe the burro le worst. There is one place for the burro and one only, and that s a pack animal in mountainous countries. tAnd still we have the goat. I think them preferable to any of others; yet if you value the fruit trees they kill and the shrub - ■ they ruin, besides the other inconveniences of having them ind, you will see that you cannot miss it by giving the children pet they all want, the shaggy little Shetland. But if you have act of rough, hilly land covered with shrubbery and undergrowth, goat is the fellow you want. He will clear the land and get fat ig it. So you see all of these animals are useful in their way, when it comes to making a pet for the children, none of them, all of them added together, can replace the Shetland. I In his native land the Shetland is not used altogether as a d's pet, but is used as a beast of burden by the fishermen and ir wives. When his day's work is done he is often turned out to ve that cold, bleak wind and find his supper and breakfast on tited shrubbery and seaweed. But, here again nature has taken land and supplied the pony with a long, shaggy coat of hair, te authorities claiming that it grows as much as a quarter of an h in one night when the weather gets extremely cold. In this intry the ponies are becoming a little shorter-haired because they better cared for in the winter, and our weather is also milder year round. As I have said, every child has a desire for a pet, and if they do not have it they will hunt some other amusement to occupy their time and interest them. A pony's companionship is the best thing for a boy or girl. If you live on the farm, the children's pony will be the most reliable stand-by on the place. It will be — "Eddie, get on your pony and go for the cows," or to the mail-box, or a neighbors, or to town when the automobile refuses to run. And when Eddie is not doing some of these little labor-saving steps for you he is having a nice little ride or drive on his own account — and surely it is better for him^to be riding his pony than to be in town or somewhere else, possiblyjin bad company. The pony will teach him no bad habits. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 235 tlf you live in town, there will be the same little errands to be e — the mail, the meat, the groceries, the trips for mamma or a here and there: and more than his country cousin, it is neces - f that he have a pony to use, that he may make trips into the ntry to see his friends. Much better, that, than running around streets. A Shetland pony is far better company for your boy girl than bad associates. I think most parents make a mistake by not buying a pony soon enough for their children. I would advise buying a colt when either one or two years old, when the children are not over three or four. Let them grow up together and be chums; let them play together on the lawn and in the lots. Help them to ride it as soon as they are acquainted with one another — it will not hurt the pony as they mature at from one and one-half to two years old. Let them know that they have a pet they can always depend upon, then as the child and the pony grow older together they will become in - separable. Give them to understand that the pony is theirs; have them take care of it, feed and water it, and do their own saddling and unsaddling just as soon as they are old enough. Let them learn its habits and ways, then when they are grown up they will under - stand what a horse is and what should be expected of it. They will not be like a society girl just married. She had never seen the inside of a kitchen until she married a man in moderate circumstances, and they started housekeeping. Her husband came home one night and asked her if she had taken any lesson in cooking that day. "Yes, dear" she said, "I took one; I learned how to boil water." To show you that the demand for Shetland ponies is increasing I wish to refer you to the fact that in the year 1912 two exportation of fifty each were made to England by George A. Simpson o Wheaton, Illinois. This will suggest one of two things — either they are following Teddy's advice and raising larger families, or they hav found some other use for the little animal. The Breeders' Gazette, commenting on the Madison Square horse show, said: "The one kind of horse that the automobile did not hurt is the Shetland pony." They were there in larger numbers and of better quality than ever before, and more people crowded around their stalls than at any other place. Last fall, at the Iowa State Fair the George A. Heyl miniature six started following the Nels Morris big six, but at Minnesota they were changed at the request of the Morris driver, as he said all the applause was for the Shetlands and he preferred to follow, since then he, too, might get some cheering. That shows that the child is not the only one inter - ested in the pony. At our recent State Fair there were times when horse barn No. 6 (the pony barn) was so packed that people could hardly get through. "The children wanted to see the ponies" was the excuse one friend would give another if they happened to meet — you remember how you used to take Johnny to see the circus? We are glad the children want to see them, and we are glad </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Ewant to see them; that's why we breed them and show them, the day is fast approaching when you will all be much more rested in them than now. We want to see every home have a tland pony or two, and I think it will be one of the big steps ard better citizens and better government in years to come. And ember, the girl needs one also, because by the time she is a nan she'll vote, too. I The one reason for the increased interest and demand just men - id is the automobile. We have in the State of Nebraska about 90, in Illinois perhaps 65,000, and in Iowa a little less, I believe, b in other states they are sold according to the population. A ; majority of these people sold their driving-horse or team, as the may be, and if they live in town they have nothing but the if they live on the farm they have only the heavy work-horses the car. Old Dobbin is a thing of the past, so here is where Shetland and the child come in. We must have something for children to ride and drive, and of course it will be the gentle, ble Shetland, as mamma and papa can also hitch it up and drive town as quickly as they used to go. The question is often asked — " How long will the demand con - tinue for the Shetland?" One answer that has been made, and that is good enough to stand repetition is, "Just as long as we American people continue to raise children, just so long will the demand for the Shetland pony continue." LOCAL LIVE STOCK ORGANIZATION By Geo. Christopher In this discussion I propose to bring together and briefly describe all the various agencies and factors that are working together to foster and improve live stock industries of the country. In addition to the work of the state and the United States governments, the experiment stations, and agricultural colleges, yearly fairs and ex - positions, and journals of the country, there are the national state and local organizations which represent in the strongest measure the positive side of the Live Stock Industry. tThe American National Live Stock Association is largely made of representatives of state and local associations that discuss itions of national importance, such as the extension of our foreign e, reasonable shipping regulations, equitable and just transpor - &gt;n rates for stock, sanitary regulations which shall provide for orm control and eradication of all diseases affecting the live k interests of the country, and protection and utilization of public ing lands, the securing of staple prices for animals and animal lucts at the great packing centers, education of the public in rd to the utilization of the coarser parts of slaughtered animals, </seg>
            <seg id="p237">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 237 The association also acts as a bureau of information on matters of general public interests relating to live stock. In addition to this national society which is made up of the representatives of the live stock interests generally, there are many other societies of national scope, devoted to particular animals or breeds. Such are the National Pig Breeders' Association, National Woolgrowers' Association, National Dairy Association, American Aberdeen Angus Association, American Short-horn Breeders' Association, American Poland China Record Co., Etc. ■ There is a national association for practically every pure breed animal now being bred in the United States. t These national associations push the interests of the particular al or breed they represent, and publish the herd book of the i each society represents. The particular society adveitises the breed they represent and publish popular information concerning it, so that its merits may become widely known throughout the country. They offer premiums at county, state and national fairs or expositions, and growing of high grade specimens of the breed, in every way seeking to pro - mote its interests. I In addition to these national organizations representing the eds, there are state associations, and many local associations oughout the states representing the same breed. Members of association who are raising pure breed animals can secure the Utration of these animals and their progeny in the herd book of association upon payment of a small fee for each animal. The poses of these herd books is to record the genealogy of each mal in the breed, and thus give information to the purchaser or eder regarding the history of the animal he is using. This is of nendous importance in estimating the possible future value of the mal. In addition these books show the standard of excellence ipted for the breed and enumerate the points which it is desired perpetuate in the breed. There are also farmers' institutes which are a kind of traveling school for the instruction of the adult farmer and his family. They are usually carried on under the auspices of the state. tThe principal speakers are professors and workers in the agricul - colleges and experiment stations and successful farmers who able to present their methods clearly. The latter, when well id in the principles of agriculture, make the most effective kers. These institutes in each state are usually under the direction of K'neral state manager who provides for the meetings throughout state in co-operation with local societies. The state usually ishes two or three speakers and the local society the rest. tAt these institutes the best and most recent information on the Uing and care of stock, the value of improved stock, the grow - of crops for stock, dairy problems, and kindred agricultural sub- </seg>

At the same time the farmer is brought to feel that professor, though he may not know all the practical details of ning, nevertheless has a knowledge of the fundamental principles ch may be of great value to him. Such, in general are the pro - ons made by the nation, states, local authorities and private con - ns, to promote the interests of the live stock industry. JUDGING BEEF CATTLE By H. R. Smith t There are four breeds of cattle that are adapted primarily for production of beef — the Shorthorn, Hereford, Aberdeen Angus Galloway. While there are certain characters which distinguish breed from another, such as the red, white and roan colors of Shorthorn, the white faces of the Hereford, the short, glossy •k hairs of tho Angus, and the long, curly, black hair of the loways, the general form is much the same in all. In judging fat steers of any of these breeds, either grades or pure breds, the one selected to head the line should be that animal which is capable of converting a given amount of food into the largest number of pounds of the best quality of beef — in other words, the one which represents the largest profit to the farmer. This means good size for age, outward indications of thrift, and gaining capacit such as depth of body, fullness of heart girth, etc., early maturing and rapid fattening qualities usually associated with the low-Be blocky build and wide, short head, and finally an animal, which when slaughtered, will yield the highest percentage of dressed bee with fat and lean nicely marbled, and a carcass particularly we developed in those parts which command the highest price. As these cuts — the prime of rib, the sirloin and porterhouse steak — come from the back, much emphasis is given to width and fullness behind the shoulder, the well sprung rib, good width of back and loin and thickness of covering over those parts. Next in importance comes the wide, level rump and fullness in the thighs which yiel&lt; the round or plain steaks. Excessive bone as indicated by coarseness about the head, and prominent hips, is not desired. Neither is i desirable to have with that high condition of flesh so much sough in beef cattle, great lumps and rolls of tallow just underneath th skin which necessarily mean a loss to the butcher. In judging breeding cattle of any of the beef breeds, the same inherent fattening tendency and the same meat carrying capacity must be seen for there is a law in animal breeding called, "Like begets like." But while breeding cattle of the beef breeds must ■bow their product and reveal to the touch its character, a condition </seg>
            <seg id="p239">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 239 I flesh so high as to impair reproduction, is not to be encouraged -spring is expected from them regularly and there must be indica is in both sexes of a capacity to reproduce true to type. Whil same general form as described for the fat steer is sought in eding cattle of the beef breeds, there must be with that form tain strong indications of breeding ability. This is shown in th by the wide, masculine head, the short, thick neck, with th 1 developed crest, and moderately heavy fore-quarter. In th n there is wanted effeminacy as revealed by refinement of head k, closely-knit shoulder, and somewhat smaller bone throughout judging the different breeds some attention is also given to wha cnown as breed character. These are some of the principal qualities to be observed in rating beef cattle as they appear in the show ring. THE SELECTION OF BREEDING STOCK By Prof. R. K. Bliss I Several years ago, about the time the seed corn agitation was its height, a noted corn specialist asked a large gathering of corn eders to define "The best ear of corn to grow for seed purposes.' r'ous answers were given, including about all the fine points know the corn breeding industry, but the specialist shook his head lally he gave this simple answer to his own questions, "It is th of corn which will year after year produce the largest numbe bushels of sound corn per acre on your farm, or in other words ear of corn that will make you the largest profit." The same answer holds equally true in the selection of breeding cattle. The best type of breeding stock to select is that type which will yield the greatest profit to you on your farm and under your conditions, or the conditions that prevail in your community. This breeder who intelligently selects stock on this basis will almost certainly make a success of the stock business himself and at the lime time render a real service to his community. His rule must be the greatest profit, and he must stick to it and not be sidetracked by fancy points that have nothing to do with utility and are some - times emphasized to the positive detriment of utility. tit is at once apparent that in order to determine the type of mal that will make the greatest profit, the breeder must take &gt; consideration both the conditions under which he lives and the rket to which his cattle must go; stated in other words — he st consider both the consumer and the producer. To neglect ler may spell failure to his business. Let us first considerfthe wants of the consumer. A visit to a retail butcher -hop in any of our larger cities discloses the fact that </seg>
            <seg id="p240">240 the steaks and choice roasts sell at a very high price, while the boiling and stew pieces sell at a comparatively low price. The following wholesale price list furnished by a packing concern in Chicago shows a great variation, both in cuts of meat cut from the same animal, and in similar cuts of meat taken from different animals. Wholesale Price List for cuts of Meat You see by this table that the difference in price between the first, second, and third grades of meat in the plates, chucks, triangles, and rounds is not very great. When you come to the ribs and loins, however, you will note a tremendous increase in the prices paid for such cuts over and above other cuts sold from the same animal, or in similar cuts sold from an inferior animal. A jump in price from fifteen cents per pound for round steak to twenty-eight cents for a rib cut, or thirty cents per pound for the loin, is out of all proportion to the relative nutritive value of the meat and forces one to the conclusion that John Gosling was right, when in a meat demonstration he pointed to the cheaper cuts of meat and said, "These go to feed the masses," and then pointing to the loin and ribs said, "These go to feed the asses." The fact is that the American people as a people are free with their money and purchase what they want even though they have to pay a high price foi it. They want the cuts from the back and loin because the muscles in these cuts are used very little and are therefore tender and juicy, while the cuts from the round and shoulder are comparatively coarse and tough. In order to produce high priced cuts the animal must carry a large amount of natural flesh or red meat. Such an animal during the fattening process distributes the fat through the lean and produces marbled meat, a much sought article in high priced butcher shops. The consumer demands an animal that is broad of back and loin and at the same time carries a thick covering of flesh over these parts. This type is almost always associated with a blocky, close-built, deep-bodied low-set animal. Such an animal always brings more money on the market than the long-legged, fish-backed The difference in value to the butcher between a No. 1 and t2 carcass is strikingly shown by the chart. Take, for example, loin and rib cuts of a No. 1 and No. 2 steer. In a No. 1 steer No. 1 No. 2 No. 3 hanks . . . . 7}c per pound 1 0 jc per pound .... 9jc per pound... 8c per pound 12c per pound lie per pound...

            <seg id="p241">241 I loin ruts sell for thirty cents per pound, while in a No. 2 steer same cut sells for twenty-five and one-half cents per pound or ifference of four and one-half cents per pound. The ribs cut n a No. 1 steer sell for twenty-eight cents per pound, while n a No. 2 steer the same cut sells for twenty-four cents per nd, making a difference of four cents per pound. Taking the and rib cuts together the difference in price between a No. 1 No. 2 steer on these cuts is about four and one-quarter cents pound. I Now let us make a practical application of the above to the f producing business. A farmer has two steers weighing 1,401 inds each, one would sell as No. 1 meat and one as No. 2 meat ! will assume that these steers both dress out 60 per cent edible at, or 840 pounds each. The loin and rib cuts represent abou of the entire dressed weight, or 210 pounds for eacl er. The loin and rib cuts taken from the No. 1 steer, however for four and one-quarter cents per pound more than the loin 1 rib cuts from the No. 2 steer, or $8.92 more for the No. er. If we include the differences in prices between the other cuts meat from these two steers we can easily increase the difference selling value of the two up to $14.00 per head, or a cent a pounc ? weight. tThe cost of growing these two steers so far as feed is concerned practically the same. There is no difference in cost of care and nagement. The farmer puts the same money into each steer, t the consumer prefers one and pays $14.00 more money in order get it. t There is a lesson here for every beef producer, and that is to as nearly as the conditions under which he lives will warran type of animal demanded by the consumer. Care should be n to select broad, deep, thick-fleshed bulls. A seemingly higl id bull is often the cheapest. If the beef grower can, by usin od bull, improve the grade of the calves frcm No. 2 up to No. 1 w dollars difference in the purchase price will not make muc rence. I Now, let us look at this question from the standpoint of the ducer, and especially the producer living under Nebraska con - ons. Nebraska, extending as it does from the semi-arid grazing ins in the west to the highly fertile fields in the east, with all dations in between, presents a variety of conditions which at t thought would appear almost irreconcilable so far as a type cattle suited to all sections is concerned. The western part of state demands a type of cattle that will make the largest possible is under grazing conditions, while the eastern part of the state lands a type of cattle that will make the largest gains out of rough, unsalable feeds of the farm. In western Nebraska cattle required to travel over a larger area of land and are subject to Kter hardship than they are in eastern Nebraska. It is obvious </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 that the cattle which will be the best adapted to western Nebraska may or may not be the type of animals that will be the best adapted to eastern Nebraska. The enormous increase in the price of land in the last ten years, high priced feed, and high priced labor have all helped to further complicate conditions. The farmers of western Nebraska are fully convinced that they must raise cattle in order to make the best returns from their ranches, while the farmers of the eastern part of the state are in doubt as to the advisability of raising beef cattle at all, many of them having already decided that a bushel of corn delivered at the elevator is safer than a bushel of corn delivered in the form of beef at the packing plant. Hence, the breeder in eastern Nebraska has the problem of not only selecting the type of cattle best suited to his conditions, but also of convincing his neigh - bor that it will be profitable to raise beef cattle. I In order to convince the farmer of eastern Nebraska, who lives land that cost from $80 to $150 per acre, that beef making is ifitable, it will be necessary to demonstrate to him how he can rket the roughage and unsalable feeds of the farm through the dium of meat. It will be necessary to furnish him with a type cattle suitable for that purpose. As our population increases, the use of corn in meat production will decrease. This will be because a bushel of corn consumed directly by human beings is more economical than it is to feed the corn to a steer and then afterwards eat the steer. What is true of corn and other concentrates is not true of hay, fodder, forage, and other roughage. Such feeds cannot be consumed directly by human beings and hence it will always be the mission of some animal, either cow or sheep, to take these coarse rough feeds and manu - facture them into edible products. The time when we will stop feeding corn in considerable quan - tities to cattle is a lcng ways in the future and will probably not greatly affect us. However, the competition on corn as a food between the human animal and the bovine animal is already heie, and is indicated by the grudging manner in which corn has been fed during the past few years. What the farmers of the corn belt arc looking for today is a type of cattle that will convert the rough - age and waste food of the farm along with a minimum of corn into edible meat, and the breeder who persistently sets out to furnish that sort of animal will serve his community well. tin addition to what the consumer demands the breeder must animals of strong constitution, deep and full through the chest carrying this depth straight back to the flank. In order to ume a large amount of rough coarse feed the cow must have a s in which to handle it. Fortunately this station has experimental at hand to show that beef animals of wide deep conformation, luring large around the middle, are the fastest and most econom - producers. A soft, mossy coat of hair covering a pliable skin </seg>
            <seg id="p243">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 243 indicates that the secretions of the body are good, and is almost invariably associated with the ability to make rapid and economical gains. It is especially important in selecting breeding animals that they meet the above conditions. Such animals meeting the above conditions are desirable both for the range and for the corn belt farm. Hence the type of animal necessary to convert rough feed into meat is after all quite the same, whether found on the range or in the corn belt. In addition to this we must have size and early maturing qualities. The men who purchase our surplus bu Is demand size, even though it may be associated with a little coarseness. They are probably right in desiring good-sized animals because size usually goes with a broader, deeper more capacious middle that enables the animal to take care of the farm roughages to better advantage. Early maturing qualities should be associated with size in order to market the surplus stock at a profitable age. There is at least one point of vaiiance between western and eastern Nebraska in regard to cattle. The ranch farmer is not particularity concerned about the milking ability of the cow, while the corn belt farmer is rather insistent on this point. The beef grower on the ranch or large farm does not care so long as the cow is able to raise her own calf in a fairly respectable manner, while the corn belt farmer wants a cow that can raise two calves, or at least a cow that gives enough milk to make her own calf as fat as butter at weaning time so that the youngster may be hustled off to market as baby beef at fourteen or sixteen months of age. The corn belt farmer is exactly right in demanding a cow that will give enough milk to make the largest possible growth in her offspring. We shall not go very far in solving the beef problem by producing cows that require help in raising their calves. The cow should be sufficient unto herself when it comes to rearing the calf. If we art not careful we will have our beef cows so aristocratic that they will prefer to do away with the calf entirely. There are too many "wet nurses" connected with fancy beef production at present for the good of the industry. In addition to this there is the open question whether the "milk-less" cow has the maternal instinct as well de - veloped or is as good and sure a breeder as is the cow that it too improvident to supply her offspring with sufficient food for its best development. In discussing this question of the type of cow demanded by the Ebelt f aimer it might be of interest to call your attention to Btics which I collected while in lows. Conditions in Iowa eastern Nebraska are not materially different, and I believe the wing figures will approximate conditions through the corn belt in Nebraska.

Answers I It is evident that the corn belt farmer does not believe that he board a cow for the increase of the calf alone. As our land grows er in price this belief will grow stronger rather than weaker. So far as the cattle question is concerned the farmers of Nebraska may be roughly classified in three groups. In the first group we may place the ranchers of the west and the large farmers of the corn belt who will be interested in producing beef and beef only, and hence will desire cattle that are good rustlers and capable of making beef on grass. In the second group we may place the farmers living on small farms who have plenty of labor and who, wishing to make their land produce as much as possible, will keep dairy cows. Of course these two extremes will not be entirely governed by the size of the farm, and we will find dairymen on large farms and beef pro - ducers on small farms. In the main, however, this classification will be correct. In between these two groups we may place a third group who will raise cattle primarily for the purpose of converting '.heir rough feed and unsalable feed into profitable beef and milk. They will have no special puipose in raising cattle other than that of making profitable returns out of that which would otherwise go •o waste. It is this third group of farmers who will take the majority of jut surplus beef bulls and upon whom we will draw for a large sroportion of our feeding steers. These farmers want cows that will pay a P art °' their way at the pail. These cows can scarcely be of the dumpling type but will be of large capacity, broad across the hocks and deep bodied in order that they may make use of the roughage and waste of the farm to the best possible advantage. The demand from every quarter is for cattle of broad deep capacious middles, capable of utilizing either the grass of the range or the forage of the corn belt to the best possible advantage. In addition to this the average farmer of the corn belt wants a cow that gives enough milk to raise two calves instead of one. tWhen it comes to selecting cattle the dairyman has the advan - of us.

            <seg id="p245">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 245 and proceeds to select his cows on the basis of efficiency or per formance. The beef grower has a more difficult problem. If h could tell just which animal put on flesh at the cheapest rate and o the best quality his problem would be largely solved. Unfortunatel; it is -difficult to do this. At the best he is obliged to do considerabl guessing. I have been giving suggestions to breeders, now I want to give suggestions to the men who buy bulls of breeders. First of all buy I pure bred bull. You invite failure by breeding to a grade or ■ss-bred bull. Buy a strong burly bull that is wide and deep of dy and of good size for his age. I would rather have size, width d depth, even though it may be combined with a little coarse - is, than to buy a small bull of the extreme dumpling type. Buy a bull whose mother was a sure breeder, and had the maternal instinct developed sufficiently to give her calf the largest possible growth on nature's food. The sire of the bull you are buying should come in for his share of questioning. He should be burly, strong, of good size, wide, deep, heavy fleshed, and from a mother that needed no help in rearing him. Our herd books should keep a record of these things so that we could select animals intelligently. When we really begin to solve this problem of beef production we will want to know the flesh-making and calf-producing record of the ancestry of the animal which we purchase, and breeders will do well to furnish I A good bull ought not to be sold out of a community until his fulness is over. We are depending too much on young bull* and iwing our old bulls to be sent to the shambles, not because they ved themselves poor breeders, but because they are related to le of our own animals. Some neighbor ought to take this bull tead of allowing him to go to market. It is much safer and wiser purchase an old bull that has proved his merit than it is to pur - se a young untried bull. The solution of the beef question is as much a man problem a* it is a cow problem. Before we can improve the cow we must educate the man. That education must come from the inside out, rather than from the outside in. You will be obliged to solve these problems largely for yourselves. This can best be done through co - operation and organization, both between yourselves and with your experiment stations. If the selection of beef breeding stock could be discussed in farmers' clubs and granges in each community during the coming winter it would do more to settle these questions than can be done in any other way. But we do not have the organizations through which to do the work of education. This is an invitation to every one of you who is really interested in agricultural improve - ment to get your coat off, roll up your sleeves and go to work to organize. Don't wait for a more propitious time, but do it yourself and do it now. Finally let me say that I am very optimistic concerning beef </seg>

Nebraska can produce beef cheaper than other corn belt state east or west, with the possible exception Kansas. Only the cheap ranges can expect to compete with a :e that combines two of the greatest meat producing feeds known man — corn and alfalfa. Nebraska, situated as it is midway'be - en the Atlantic and the Pacific, as far as possible from an out - for corn and hay with an excellent market within her borders, 1 with the best known feeds for meat making available on every ■n, is preeminently situated for beef production. PROLIFIC SWINE By Ellis Rail I am to speak to you a few minutes about "Prolific Swine." I believe this is a very important subject. In fact, I suppose my belief in its importance is much greater than is my knowledge of it. Professor Deitrich, the former Illinois authority, says that the matter of prolificacy is one of great importance. Says this authority, "A sow that produces twelve pigs at farrowing and raises ten is much more than twice as valuable as a sow that farrows seven and raises five." If it takes the first five pigs to pay the cost of keeping the sow a year, there is no profit. But with the sow raising more than this number, every additional pig is pure profit. We wish to emphasize this point briefly: that men should know how much it costs to keep the sow, and not be satisfied unless there is a profit coming from her, as well as from feeding the pigs after weaning time. Careful experiments by Deitrich, also by Henry of Wisconsin, show that hogs cannot be maintained on less than a one per cent ration. This means that for a 350 pound hog it will require 1,125 pounds of feed annually. At the average of feed prices for several years, this will cost fully a cent a pound, or $11.25. Doubling this amount for eighty days, the time that the pigs are suckling, will demand 280 pounds more at an additional cost of $2.80, making the total feed bill $14.05. To this must be added interest on the value of the sow, cost of labor, boar service, and a fair amount for cost of shelter, bedding, etc. Altogether, it is readily found that twenty dollars is a very conservative estimate, in fact, is a minimum cos* for maintaining a fair sized brood sow for a year. Her litter then must at weaning time be worth at least that amount exclusive of what they might be fed other than through the dam, prior to weaning, before any profit can be realized in the sow. Only five pigs would scarcely be worth twenty dollars at weaning time. It would take six to offset cost, and there would be net profit until the seventh pig. Of course, this is estimating results from only one litter per year. We have put it in this fashion to show in a way at least, </seg>
            <seg id="p247">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 247 why the sow should raise two litters per year instead of one. She stands a much better chance of paying her board and lodging ac - counts. We turn now from a discussion of the importance of pro - lificacy to ways of obtaining it. tin selecting and handling swine to get large litters we believe s are four chief factors concerned. These are ancestry or pedi - individuality, age, and care and feeding. We wish to discuss of these factors in relation to its influence on large production. With respect to ancestry, we believe that sows which come o large litters have more capacity for producing large litters than d sows coming from small litters; in other words, prolificacy is a hereditary character. Our observations for several years of all th sows farrowing here on the University Farm substantiate this theory The observations of many successful swine men corroborate it. Bu most men do not observe it fully enough. All characters which ar hereditary are transmissable through the sire as well as through th dam. We expect speed to come from the racing stallion as we as from the mare. Dairymen require that their herd bulls com from the greatest working dams of the breed. And they get result in the increased milking capacity of the heifers sired by such bull to demonstrate the wisdom of observing such ancestral influence If these characters are transmissible through sires, why is not pro lificacy transmissible by the boar? We do not mean to say tha a boar from a large litter will get large litters himself in the genera tion immediately following him, but the pigs sired by him will b affected for this particular character, just the same as their color, type, etc., will be influenced by their sire. Allow me to quote here from the well known breeder- investigator, Mr. Q. I. Simpson of Palmer, Illinois. Speaking before the Annual Meeting of the Ameri - can Breeders Association, in 1911, he said. "We have made some observations of prolific mothers that lead us to believe that daughters from such prolific sows, and daughters from these sows' sows are themselves prolific; so much do we believe in this that we do not use a boar or a sow in our economic herd that is not from a big brood and from a mature sow that has herself been tested in this line. "We know of men who are quite particular to save brood sows from big broods but will take a herd boar from any source without an investigation of his inherent fecundity." , We emphasize again this point. Prolificacy is a character that is heritable just the same as is color, or form. Because it is a herit - able factor, boars as well as sows should be constantly chosen from prolific stiains if large prolificacy is to be established and main - ta'ned in the herd. The second factor affecting prolificacy is individuality. With - out the proper conformation it seems impossible for most sows to produce and mother large litters. We do not wish to put too much time in on the discussion of this point, as it is the one to which most men have given some attention. It is well known that the </seg>
            <seg id="p248">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 248 short chubby conformation is conducive to small Utters. So most men have learned to pick longer sows. But we believe thor - oughly, basing our belief on several years observation, that length is only one factor in form, and that depth of body is equally neces - sary or more so than is depth. We have observed many long bodied sows that did not farrow large litters, and they usually were shallow, being especially shallow in the hind flank. Too much length, so much so that the top line is not carried strong and at least level, is objectionable. A low back means more or less of weakness, and as the sow gets well forward in pregnancy the strain is severe. If she is not strong in the back the strain is much harder on her than is compatible with the best health. Our contention is that it is the roomy-middled sow with strong vitality and constitution that makes the best mother. Roominess can be had by getting depth with reasonable length, and strength of the top line will not be sacrificed. Also a deep animal has more room forward for the vital organs, hence more vitality and constitutional vigor. {Besides form, we want to suggest here the possible relation ween the number of teats and litter-bearing capacity. We make statement as to this being a fact, but suggest the possibility it, also mentioning the fact that the wild hog of the German »ts, the Schwarzwold type, for instance, has an average of only teats, with an average litter of four. Simpson is authority for statement that there are strains and families of domestic pigs h an average of thirteen teats and an average of eleven pigs per I have referred to age as being one of the factors influencing prolificacy. I refer here to the fact that the young sow, that is the gilt, will not produce as large a litter on the average, as will older sows. And such data as I have been able to get information from indicates that sows do not reach their full degree of prolificacy until two years old. The records of the breeding herd of sows kept at the Iowa Station, where over sixty litters a year are farrowed, showed when taken for a period of four years that gilts produced about 10 per cent fewer pigs than yearling sows, and that yearling sows were about that much below older sows. At the North Platte Station, similar results have been shown to obtain. An inspection of bulletin 121 from the Experimental Station which deals with the cost of producing a fifty pound pig, shows that the average size of litters farrowed from the sows used in those experiments was approximately 20 per cent larger for old sows than it was for gilts. Observations other than those already referred to, and extending over a period of several years, leave no question in our minds as to the comparative number of pigs produced by old and young sows. t Turning now to the question of feed and its influence on fecun- Doubtless this is one of the most important consideration, it is worth our most serious attention because it is the one &gt;r completely within our control. To say th»t the question of </seg>
            <seg id="p249">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 249 how a sow is fed will determine more largely than anything else the number of pigs she will fairow, may be too strong a statement. Yet we have little hesitancy in stating that unless the sow is rightly fed the size and quality of the litter is apt to be discouraging. The right methods of feeding will not produce large litters, but wrong methods of feeding can and will keep sows from producing plenti - fully, which if they had been rightly handled would have produced satisfactorily. It seems almost unnecessary before an audience such as this to take up in detail the evil effects of poor feeding from the standpoint of its effect on the prospective litter. Yet it is a point for serious thought and consideration. Allow us to call your atten - tion to some results secured at the Icwa Station in 1910. Mr. Evvard, the experimental feeder, took thirty-five head of gilts bred to the same sire, divided them into seven lots of five each, and fed each lot differently with a view to ascertaining the effect of the ration used upon the litters. Corn was used as a basal ration, and various supplemental feeds used for the different lots. The ration for each lot was as follows: Lot I, corn alone. Lot II, corn, 1-30 meat meal. Lot III, corn, 4-30 meat meal. ■ Lot IV, corn, 1-3 of a mixture of oats, 3 parts bran, middlings oil-meal 2. Lot V, corn, chopped clover hay sprinkled with molasses Lot VI, corn, clover in racks. Lot VII, corn, alfalfa in racks. It will be noticed that the rations for lots 3, 4, and 7 are much the best types carrying more protein. The average size of the litters from these lots was 9.2 pigs as against 7.1 from the other lots; also the average number of pigs raised to weaning time for lots 3, 4, and 7 was seven, while for the lots 1, 2, 5, and 6, the average size of litters at weaning time was only 5.9. It is interesting to note in this connection that the size of the pigs at birth was much greater for the lots that were properly fed and the pigs were much stronger and more vigorous. Another thing of particular interest to Nebraska hog raisers is this: alfalfa in the racks gave practically as good results as did any other supplement. These sows all were gilts. The alfalfa lot gained over half a pound a day all through the period of pregnancy. They ate on the average 3} pounds corn per day and 1.1 pounds alfalfa. Evvard reported later that sixty sows and gilts in 1912 corroborated quite closely the previous experiments. We might multiply the above data to a large extent, but to do so would be simply to extend the length of this paper, with a repeti - tion of similar results. There can be no question as to the im - poitance of a proper nutrition for pregnant sows, if large strong litters are to be had at farrowing time. K- There is another phase of this feeding question and its effect prolificacy that we would like to consider briefly. Sheep men </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have long held, and practically demonstrated, too, that the percent - age of lambs is dependent on the condition of the ewes at the time of conception. We suspect that the same proposition is as influential in swine as in sheep. Our theory is based on the following logical facts and assumption. First, we must consider that the beginning of the young is not at the time of its so-called birth but at the time of conception when the egg cell from the female is fertilized by the sperm or male cell from the male body. The generative organs of either sex are among the most highly developed and most sensitive organs of any part of the body. Their products, which are the germ or parent cells that are to form the beginning of the young, must necessarily reflect the physical condition of the organs which produced them. Now if these organs, that is the reproduction organs, be weakened, run down, or in any way other than in perfect physical condition, then the germ cells must be weakened and low in vitality. We do not expect large germination or full yields from seeds of plants that are low in vitality. How then, can we get large germination or conception from the weakened and devita - lized seed cell of the animal body? Stated in a few words, and very concretely, our point is this: A poorly nourished body means a body at less than a maximum of vitality. If the body is low in vitality, all parts of it will be, and the most sensitive organs of the body probably will be the most readily affected. Since the reproductive organs are delicate and sensitive, such lack of vitality and energy doubtless will be found in them. Therefore they will have a lessened strength and vitality, and the sum total of conceptions and success - ful fertilizations will be less with generative cells of such a character than it will among parent cells of strong, fully developed character, or from animals showing a maximum of health. This means that atten - tion should be given to the female some time previous to the time of breeding, and that she should be so fed and cared for that at the time of mating she will be in vigorous healthy form. We have little data at hand to verify this theory but all there is is in support of it. Mr. Simpson, whom we quoted at the beginning of this paper, says that they have gotten eminently satisfactory results by "warm - ing up" their sows previous to breeding time by feeding liberally with highly nitrogenous foods. Notes and observations on the size of litters and the vitality of the pigs at farrowing time taken at the Iowa Station also show that the sows which were in the best physical condition had the largest and strongest litters. We believe a little closer attention to this point will be found to be well worth the consideration of swine breeders. Briefly reviewed, we have presented these points for your con - sideration as factors having to do with prolificacy in swine. First that prolificacy is a character factor, the same as is form or color. Therefore it must be recognized as being heritable; and if prolific swine are to be had right along, they must continually be selected from the most prolific strains. Again, form has its limiting factors. </seg>
            <seg id="p251">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 251 I individual females must be chosen that are roomy middled. roominess may be had through length and depth both, but so much length as to cause slackness of backs. Hence, weakness ild be avoided while depth should be insisted upon as of equal stance with length. Third, age has its influence on size of rs produced, and we find that the full degree of prolificacy in i is not reached before maturity or at about two years of age &gt;lly improper nutrition may cause low fecundity, no matter how h attention is given to the other factors influencing large pro - ion, and that the matter of nutrition and management must be n fully as much consideration as that of the animal itself. WHO WILL PRODUCE THE FEEDERS FOR THE FUTURE By A. C. Davenport (Editor Daily Drover* Journal — Stockman) t Far-seeing men told us a long time ago that we of the United tes were making beef faster than we were making cattle; that were sending fat cattle to the shambles more rapidly than we e producing calves; that so far as the cattle industry was con - ned we were killing the goose that laid the golden egg. But we, a nation do not believe in modern prophecies and must be shown ore we believe. kWell! we are being shown, and shown so clearly that even the t skeptical is being forced to acknowledge that the prophets of w years ago were true prophets. We have during the year past seen the shipments from the range fall to the lowest point in many years. We have seen the receipts at the big market centers shrinking steadily before our eyes, in spite of the fact that every corner of the country was being ransacked for cattle to keep our packing houses supplied. We have seen the total number of cattle in farmers' hands in our own state of Nebraska drop from two millions and a quarter in 1908 to a million and a half in 1912, a loss in five years, to be exact, of 688,000 head. We have seen other states of the corn belt tending in the lime direction. I We have seen our enormous export trade fade away until during &gt; last quarter of 1912 not a pound of beef and only 900 head of ttle were shipped out of the United States. We note from the vernment figures that no longer ago than 1901 we had beef to ■d all our own people and a sufficient surplus so that we could port 352,000,000 pounds. From millions to zero in eleven years going downhill at a rate rapid enough to break all the speed limits the law of trade. We have seen the population of our country </seg>
            <seg id="p252">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 252 {'ease 25 per cent in twelve years and the cattle population decrease equal or greater percentage in the same time. We have seen f p ices during a period of peace and prosperity carried to the best point on record. We have seen feeding and stock cattle higher than ever before and higher than fat cattle were wont bring in years past. We have seen calves selling higher than eding cows were bringing a few years ago. We have seen thousands fine breeding cows, thrifty young heifers and heifer calves sent the slaughter during the past year under the influence of these le high prices. I We have seen all these things and many more, and we have had lught home to us in a most forceful manner the disquieting truth it the cattle industry of the country has reached a most critical ge. When I say cattle industry I am putting it too mildly, for reality the whole farming industry of the corn belt states is in - ved in the crisis. If you doubt it let me ask what is to be done ;h the corn crop if there are not cattle enough to consume it? ;hough we are just beginning to realize that there is a shortage cattle supplies the corn market shows it very plainly. Many of us can remember when corn in Nebraska was not worth hauling to market and I myself have burned as good corn as anyone ever saw because it was a cheaper fuel than soft coal. The price of corn advanced as the cattle feeding industry grew, and they must decline together. Large corn crops do not necessarily mean cheap beef cattle, some authorities notwithstanding, but a scarcity of cattle must mean cheap corn. It follows that we must have cattle to eat our corn if the prosperity of the farming industry of the corn belt is to be maintained. tThe question that confronts us and the one that I have been ested to answer is, " Who will produce the Feeders for the ire?" In a situation like the present it will avail nothing to e an off hand prophecy because, as previously noted, we do not ■ve in modern prophecies and must be shown. As it is impos - i for us to be shown what is not yet in existence, all I can do t point out the current of present events and deduce from that t should, in the natural course of events, come to pass. I First, let me say that the making of beef on the plan followed "ing the last twenty years or more was at best only a makeshift, could not be expected with the population of the country steadily ihing westward, that the system under which feeding cattle were d west of the farming belt and shipped back to the farming belt be fattened for beef, could forever endure. It was inevitable, as i pressure of population toward the west continued, that the time uld come when the farming belt would overlap the cattle breeding t to such an extent as to greatly hamper the production of cattle der range conditions. do not, however, agree with those who believe that the day of range feeder is nearing an end. In common with many others </seg>
            <seg id="p253">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 253 who have studied the range proposition closely I believe that the production of range cattle .is now at or very near low water mark, an&lt; that in the next few years the number of cattle available for feedini purposes from the range will show an increase over recent years I base this statement upon the assumption that in the very nea future it will be pretty well determined what lands are suitable fo crops under the dry farming and irrigation systems and what land must be given over to the grazing of live stock. When the interests of the farmers and stock growers cease to clash, and the operations of each are within well defined boundaries, millions of acres that are not now available for any purpose can and will be put to stock grazing. That of itself will mean increased production of stock. The dry farmers, as well as the farmers under irrigation, if they are to succeed at all, must sooner or later work into the stock business and become producers of cattle on a small scale individually but on a large scale collectively. Every live stock and agricultural association in the corn belt should help along the work of restoring cattle breeding on the range by demanding that the government give as much encouragement to the small stock grower or ranchman as it is giving to the dry farmers and to irrigation farmers. In truth, it is more essential that the government should encourage stock growing than farming, as the country does not need more farm crops nearly so much as it needs more cattle to consume the crops that are already being produced. I believe that this organization would be doing a great public service if it were to call the attention of the agricultural department of the government to the pressing need on the part of the corn belt for feeders, and urge that every effort possible be put forth by the creation of new laws if necessary to encourage the production of cattle on the range until every unoccupied acre is being grazed. I would thus conclude that what has been known as the range country will in the future, as in the past, with proper encouragement from the law makers, continue to supply a great many feeding cattle for the corn belt. But there is no liklihood that it can possibly supply anything like the number that will be needed. The popula - tion of the country is rapidly increasing and more cattle must be had if we are to continue to be a nation of beef eaters, hence we must look elsewhere for additional supplies. Next after the range I would name the farm as the most' promis - ing ground for feeders. We are told that the farmer gave up breed - ing live stock because it was more profitable to grow crops of cereals, that he cannot afford to pasture cattle on his high priced land; that he will not willingly return to the breeding of cattle. I am ready to grant all that, but I say to you that a great court has been con - vened with Nature sitting on the bench as judge and that a great case is being tried out, the case of Mr. Farmer versus Mr. Soil Fertility. Mr. Farmer is complaining that Mr. Soil Fertility refuses longer to pay one hundred cents on the dollar, and Mr. Soil Fer- </seg>
            <seg id="p254">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 254 tility contends that he is being bankrupted from being forced to pay usurious interest. The experiment stations and the professors in our agricultural colleges, who are the attorneys in the defence of Soil Fertility, tell us that their client is going from bad to worse, that their client's affairs must be reorganized and managed under a different system or the farmer must take a good deal less than face value for his claim against Soil Fertility. Farmers have seen the soil become so bankrupt in many of the old eastern states that the owners abandoned thousands of farms. Our western farmers did not believe that the seemingly inexhaustible soils of the corn belt could ever be exhausted, but they are being shown. Reduced yields as compared with years gone by and small average yields of all cereals as compared to those obtained in many of the older countries of Europe have shown the western farmer that even corn belt soils can be bankrupted. There is only one remedy, the adoption of a sane method of farming in which live stock breeding will be combined with the growing of cereal crops. It makes little difference whether the farmer likes the idea or not, the cold stern decree of the Court of Nature is, "You Must Breed Cattle." There is another court whose decrees will be just as binding as the Court of Nature, and that is the court that will settle future questions as to the price of corn. I do not feel that I am in con - tempt of court when I say in advance, that the decision of this court under the law of supply and demand will be just the same as the decree of the Court of Nature, "You Must Breed Cattle." The only difference between the two cases will be that in the latter instance the farmer, if he does not wish to breed cattle, will be given the privilege of selling corn at a loss or of reducing his acreage of the cereal. But that is a doubtful privilege, as it is only a polite way of saying, "Breed Cattle, or give up Farming." There is no dodging it, the farmers must adopt a system of live stock farming in the form of dairying, or beef production, or a combination of the two, or allow their soil to become unprofitable as a producer of crops. This truth has already taken deep root in the minds of the more progressive farmers of the country, and the result will be the gradual introduction of a better system of farming that must embrace the production of live stock as well as cereals. Dairying is already a well established and profitable branch of live stock farming, but the calves from the dairy herds cannot as a rule be profitably grown into feeders. They must continue in the future as in the past to supply the country with veal. It has been urged by some that feeders of the beef breeds cannot be profitably grown on high priced farm lands; that the farmer cannot afford to board a cow a whole year for the purpose of raising a calf. The answer is that he should make the cow pay her own board in milk and butter. As a matter of course, the beef breeds </seg>
            <seg id="p255">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 255 are not presumed to be good dairy animals, but where care is taken to select good individuals they are better milkers than many would have us believe, and some of them have records falling little behind the dairy breeds. This system of farming, to be successful, must be reduced to thorough business principles and must include the very best methods of securing the very largest amount of feed possible from the land. There is no use in saying that it can't be done, remember that the decree of the courts is that it must be done. Our agricultural and experiment stations will show us how to do it. Under this system every feeder will raise a few feeders himself; if not as many as he wishes to finish for market, he can buy a few additional head coming from that other great source of supply — the range. It is a most significant fact that there are a few farmers who have all along been raising a few feeders. Within the last two months I have heard several feeders on the South Omaha market, when asked as to how they came out with their feeding operations, answer in this way: "I did very well. You see, I raised part of the cattle I fed, myself, and they did not cost me as much as if I had bought them." If a few feeders can make money raising their own cattle, more can do the same thing, and they will do it to preserve the fertility of the soil. We are confronted by only one danger, and that is, the possi - bility of the government being induced by the hue and cry about the high cost of living to throw down the tariff wall and give us free beef and free cattle. Such a move would tend to arrest the development of our cattle industry and prevent the natural working out of the problem as I have outlined it. I believe that all the live stock and agricultural associations of the country should combine to urge upon the government the practicability of relieving the beef shortage by encouraging cattle breeding at home rather than abroad. It is only necessary for the country to be patient a little time until conditions on the range can be readjusted, and until the farmers of the cornbelt can reform their systems of farming. Then there will be feeders enough to consume all the corn that can be grown, and enough to make all the beef that the country can consume. THE CONTROL OF HOG CHOLERA (Abstract from Address) fThis subject at once suggests the use of immune serum. After e extended experimental and practical field work with hog cholera immune serum in the United States, there is no longer any doubt 110 its value, and the consideration of the problem of hog cholera trol without serum would be out of the question. Dr. Paul Fischer, Columbus, Ohio </seg>
            <seg id="p256">256 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Any plan for the successful control of cholera must have immune serum for its basis. What is immune serum? It is the liquid con - stituent (the serum) of the blood of an immune pig that haa been re-immunized with an excessive dose of blood from a cholera infected pig and has thus developed an unusual quantity of immune bodies (a protective substance that is present in the blood of all immune swine). Comparatively small amounts of the serum from hyperimmune swine, injected into the tissues (leg) of susceptible animals of the same species will render them immune. The immunity continues for a variable period, depending upon the age of the pig and on its individual characteristics, usually from four to six weeks. Exposure to disease during this period, either by the injection of disease producing blood or confinement with sick animals proves harmless. Further, such exposure usually lengthens the duration of immunity so that it may approach in permanency, the immunity following an actual attack of disease. This condition may be brought about artificially by the injection of a certain amount of disease producing blood with the serum. This is called the double method, or the serum-virus simultaneous method, or simply the simultaneous treatment. The duration of immunity following the serum-simultaneous treatment also varies with the age of the animal and with its in - dividual characteristics, as well as with the character of the virus. As a rule, suckling pigs, when given the serum-simultaneous treatment, will retain immunity about three months. Weaned pigs, or shoats, retain immunity, after being given the serum-simultaneous treatment, six or eight months, yearlings or mature animals, one year. Of course, the variation in individuals causes more or leas variation in these periods but for general purposes, for practice on the farm and as a basis for systematic control of the disease over a large area, they are quite valuable guides. Essential in the success of hog cholera control work, whether private or state, are, 1. Reliable or potent serum which must be administered in sufficiently large doses and 2. Virus of a known strength which must be administered in doses large enough to be effective and yet not so large as to be dangerous. Excessive doses of virus will produce an attack of disease, in - stead of protection against it, while too small a dose will fail to pro - duce lasting immunity. It is much the same with the serum — too small a dose is dangerous on account of possible development of active disease, while too large a dose tends to shorten the period of immunity. The Ohio plan, to overcome these objections as far as practicable, is to use serum and virus of tested or standard strength and, to </seg>
            <seg id="p257">257 allow for the variable susceptibility of different pigs in our field work, we use twice as much serum as we find necessary to protect test pigs. For practical purposes — on account of the much longer immunity following the serum double treatment as compared with the use of serum alone, the former, if properly applied is by far the most economical to use and, on account of the expensiveness of serum treatment at the best, the double treatment must be the basis of all present plans for the control of hog cholera on a large scale. Concerning the preparation of serum, I have brought a few lantern slides which will illustrate the method used in our Ohio plant at Reynoldsburg. Dr. Stouder has already described the details of these operations. As to the field use of serum. Hog cholera immune serum is recognized, primarily as a preventive agent although, in the early stages of infection, before the appearance of clinical symptoms (excepting fever) this serum undoubtedly asserts curative effects. But, under all circumstances, the best effects are obtained by the early use of serum, before infection occurs. In a few words, acute outbreaks of the disease can be promptly checked in thrifty herds; serum is a practically absolute preventive when properly used in healthy, thrifty animals; the use of serum in chronic forms of the disease is absolutely useless and may hurry the death of affected animals. Unthrifty animals, from any cause, are not benefitted by serum to the same extent as thrifty individuals. Healthy pregnant sows are not in any way injured by the treatment. How is serum most effectively and economically used? This can be expressed under six heads. a. In the form of the double treatment. b. Promptly applied in acute outbreaks of cholera to all swine in the herd, except evidently infected individuals which should have serum only. c. Application to all exposed herds. d. Application to all herds threatened with exposure. e. Disinfection of infected premises. f. Quarantine. On permanently infected farms or larger areas the following plan has been successfully followed in Ohio. 1. Immunize all swine on the premises. (Sows, mature males, shoats and suckling pigs.) Thereafter - 2. Arrange farrowing periods so that all sows farrow within a period of six weeks. Pigs from immune sows are generally immune for that period of time. 3. Vaccinate all pigs immediately after farrowing or within six weeks thereafter. 4. Vaccinate again after two or three months. 5. Second vaccination will last till pigs are ready for market. 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p258">258 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 6. Observe carefully and if immunity seems to run out, re - vaccinate at once. 7. Vaccinate all brood sows and adult males annually as long as cholera is in the vicinity. By following closely this method, hog cholera can be eradicated. Who can apply serum? Any one who can use a hypodermic syringe and follow instructions. Who shall apply serum? This is another question. Since the successful use of serum depends on the accuracy of the dosage, and since the dosage depends on the character and stage of the disease, no one except persons familiar with the pathology of hog cholera can expect to get the best results from serum treatment. The use of serum in chronic cholera is money thrown away, the use of serum in disease other than cholera is of no benefit. The careless use of virus is dangerous, consequently, to get the best results, persons familiar with every phase of hog cholera as well as with other diseases, and informed in a broad way in regard to principles of disinfection and quarantine protection, are alone capable of getting the best results in administering serum and advising as to the general handling of outbreaks of hog cholera. The educated and trained veterinarian should be especially fitted for this work. In this connection the following question suggests itself. Shall we control hog cholera or shall we eradicate it? Either is possible. I base this statement, in part, on the assertion of the great Louis Pasteur, "It is possible to exterminate from the surface of the earth all true infectious diseases," and in part on a conviction that is the outgrowth of my own experience. I have endeavored to estimate, as accurately as such estimates are possible, the comparative cost of these two methods in Ohio, and shall try to apply the same figures to Nebraska. We can, of course, deal with approximate estimates and round numbers only. I will assume that there aie, or were, in 1912, on Nebraska farms, 4,000,000 head of swine. We have in the United States a total of about 60,000,000 swine. The losses from cholera for all states combined has been estimated by Dr. D. E. Salmon, at $50,000,000 per annum, or on the average of $1.00 per head. From my knowledge of conditions in Ohio, I cannot believe that these estimates are far from wrong. Using them as a basis of our calculations, we have an annual loss ot $3,000,000 from hog cholera in Ohio, or one of $4,000,000 in Nebraska. Assuming that one-third of all the herds in either state are in - fected or exposed to infection at one time or another during the year, it would cost $500,000 in Ohio and $666,000 in Nebraska to effectively protect these swine with serum, for one year, i. e., fifty cents per head. This is based upon the assumption that good serum can be bought at one and one-half cents per cubic centimetre. </seg>
            <seg id="p259">259 The coat of application is not included. The latter would add at least 25 per cent to our figures. «I am assuming (and I am basing this assumption on my experi - ce of the past five years during which I have directed the treat - ment of 200,000 head of swine, as well as the actual preparation of the serum used in this work) that hog cholera can be more or less successfully prevented by the unregulated use of good, bad and in - different serum, but that it can never be eradicated in that way. After five years of serum treatment in the United States, while the losses from cholera have been materially reduced, and in many places prevented altogether, the disease is as prevalent (as wide - spread) as it ever was. Consequently, under the continuation of this method, the cost of serum treatment alone, not counting the loss from cholera, would be $666,000 annually for the state of Ne - braska, ($500,000 for the state of Ohio). I believe, and this belief is based upon results of actual field experience, that the systematic use of serum under state control, will, with the expenditure of the same amount of money, lead to the eradication of the disease in the course of three years. With our present organization, in Ohio, we could not hope to undertake this task at once, nor could you, here in Nebraska. For you however know, as for us in Ohio, it is possible to make a begin - ning and to direct all of your efforts in the direction that will make this practicable in the future. The Ohio Plan of Using Scrum All serum prepared by the state laboratory is applied by veter - inarians in the employ of the state. The owner pays for the actual cost of the serum only. The serum is applied to herds in the order in which requests for treatment are received. This, of course, makes systematic operations impossible, but in the absence of a special law providing for this, no other course is open. We propose however, to enact special legislation this winter which will enable us to try, in an experimental way, the systematic eradication of the disease from a restricted area — say one county or two counties. If this proves a success, a demand for the applica - tion of the plan to the whole state will be taken care of as it comes up. We know we can control hog cholera in Ohio. What we are after now, is eradication. </seg>
            <seg id="p260">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 260 HOG CHOLERA AND ITS DIAGNOSIS- ANTI-CHOLERA SERUM AND ITS MANUFACTURE By K. W. Stouder I Hog cholera, a widely prevalent disease of swine especially in &gt; corn belt, is manifestly a contagious and infectious disease as iny owners can testify, though a specific organism for this disease s never been found. This may be due to our faulty methods of irching for it, such as failures in proper staining, or maybe due lack of sufficient power of our optical aids. In spite of the fact it the organism has not been isolated and cultivated much is at nd concerning its infectious nature, as it is usual to see it develop d run its course in nearly every member of a band when one lividual becomes affected. Likewise pens or lots once soiled with 1 infection of this disease are nearly certain to produce the disease iin when another herd is placed upon such soil unless great care taken in disinfection. This disease is a septicemia or blood infection, hence the symp - toms manifest when affected may vary considerably, as diseases of this nature usually weaken the animal and make him very suscep - tible to many complications. The symptoms also vary with the age, strength and general condition of the patient and with the ventilation and sanitation of his environment, which explains the difference in the acuteness and severity of the outbreak in different herds and individuals as well as the variation in lesions found. The usual symptoms and history are that one or more is first noticed off feed and sunken in the flank, maybe scouring, and later becoming constipated. Some show gummed eyelids, sore swollen ears and maybe sore backs. If carefully noticed and temperatures are taken, sick hogs usually have a high fever, ranging from 105 to 108° F., and are thirsty for cool clean water. Young, weak or excessively fat hogs on an unbalanced heavy corn diet seldom last long, and on death often show reddish areas on the belly and thinner skinned areas. Sometimes our alfalfa fed hogs in moderatly dry climates resist the disease to a greater extent, and it manifests itself in a more chronic form. J Young pigs suckling normal mothers seldom contract the disease il about weaning time, when the eating of soiled food is usually source of infection and explains the unthrifty condition and loss many pigs at this age when cholera is prevalent in a community. I Post-mortem lesions found vary considerably with different cases mined, but as a rule are about as follows: Reddened and inflamed as of the bowel, and even button shaped ulcers in the bowel, ecially near the juncture of the small bowel into the large one, ill petecia or spots on the kidney and a dark red or black colora - i of the lymphatic glands. Small spots of a dark red or black ;n show on the lungs, and at times a large part of the lung may involved and look like liver. Exudate may be found in the lung </seg>
            <seg id="p261">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 261 Iity, and adherence of the lung to the rib wall is not uncommon such cases. Those serious involvments of the lung which result the large dark solidified area should be looked upon as secondary olvement due probably to the congestion of the blood in a delicate ;an when the animal is too weak to resist some slight shock such a sudden change of external temperature, which, if the animal fevered, does not need to be a very marked change to produce lerious congestion of blood in the lung. This pneumonia then is lally a secondary lesion and not a primary disease in itself though t all other pneumonias is slightly contagious, especially to young It is interesting to note in this connection that in most of those outbreaks which have been reported as contagious pneumonia, care - ful investigators have been able to find some evidences of cholera, and in some of the recent outbreaks in Iowa, Illinois and Kansas, where blood samples were taken and injected into healthy sus - ceptible pigs, death soon resulted with symptoms and lesions of cholera very prominent. This same blood however, would not kill pigs protected with a potent serum in regular dosage. Is it not therefore correct to assume that cholera after weakening the animal prepares him for an invasion of the bacillus suisepticus or some of the micro cocci to produce these lesions in most instances. There are probably times when hogs kept in improper housing with poor sleeping quarters and lack of proper ventilation contract pneumonia aa a primary disease, which may kill even a large number of hogs. Such cases however, are very rare and should not be used in explain - ing deaths nearly so often as has been the custom when serum fails to protect. It is safe to say that an experienced sanitarian could determine these forms of pneumonia in our hogs as easily as we can in our cattle when they occur under like circumstances. So much for the disease as we are now seeing it in this part of the country. Let us now see if we can control in any way such a seriously con - tagious and highly fatal disease among our swine. No victory of science over disease has been of such vast inter - est to the livestock industry of the middle west in recent years as has been the perfection of the Dorsett-Niles Anti-Hog-Cholera Serum; and it is safe to say that probably no other meritorious article in so short a time has been so highly complimented as to experience such a large number of imitators. The true Dorsett-Niles process is based upon the theory that all animals which are immune to a given disease, especially if that immunity is due to having suc - cessfully passed through an attack of the disease, have in their blood certain anti-bodies which are harmful to the successful growth and progress of the germ causing that disease. If these anti-bodies can be successfully transferred from an immune animal to one of his own species which is not immune it usually is of assistance to the non-immune in combatting an exposure to the disease until he can make anti-bodies for himself. This is the basic theory. </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The following is the practical method followed to immunize A hog immune to ordinary exposure to the cholera is fastened a table. For every pound of body weight about five cubic centi - meters of the blood fluid or virus of a pig very sick with an acute form of the cholera, is passed directly into the veins of the immune hog. Thus a two hundred pound hog receives not less than 1,000 cubic centimeters, or about a quart of virus. Within ten days, by cutting off a small piece of the tail, the blood of the now hyper-immune hog is drawn, and at intervals of about seven days several blood drawings are made. This blood with the clot or fibrin removed stays fluid and is called serum. This is now tested for potency, that is, its efficiency to protect a sus - ceptible against the cholera. This is performed in several ways. The best is to give one pig some virulent blood from a known case of cholera. Give a second some of the virulent blood and a dose of serum. If the one receiving the virulent blood dies with symptoms of cholera in five to ten days the blood is surely virulent; while if the one receiving the virulent blood and serum lives thirty days and more the serum is surely potent. This is the most severe test though there are others which will readily occur on a little thought. This potent serum is now ready for field use and with a small amount of preservative added, and kept at about 50 to 60 F., will remain potent for several months. Serum more than a year old has been proven potent on test. It is applied in doses of about 30 to 40 cubic centimeters per hundred pounds with a clean, sterile syringe deep into the muscles after carefully disinfecting the site of injec- Given alone, properly made serum produces absolutely no ill effects whatever, and cannot produce the cholera. It, however, is absorbed and apparently passed out of the system until the average hog is not immune to the cholera if he lives alone for more than thirty to sixty days. If however, at the time of injecting the serum the hog is exposed to the cholera by injecting a small amount of virulent blood into his system as was performed on the test pig, the hog will without any apparent sickness become immune to the cholera for many months because he makes some of the anti-bodies of his own. There may be a loss of as high as 2 per cent with this process, but if serum alone is used, and five to ten days later serum and virulent blood used, there will be no loss and the immunity will be permanent. Obviously the latter two processes are most satis - factory in piactice, and are called the simultaneous and the double simultaneous ptocesses respectively. the past two or three years hog cholera has been fairly valent in the corn belt, and many of the state experiment stations e been distributing properly made serum, but the demand at es has exceeded the supply so much that many owners confident the efficiency of good serum have been forced to see their hogs </seg>
            <seg id="p263">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 263 contract the cholera and die, or sell immature hogs. Others have obtained serum from commercial sources, some have had good results while others have had very disastrous results, usually due to an impotent serum made probably by some inexperienced or careless person in a highly unsanitary building by an attempted Dorsett-Niles process. All of which points to the fact that if it is necessary to obtain serum from a commercial source it is best to be sure to get it from a firm of reputation, with equipment sufficient, and employees intelligent enough to permit them to make it properly and honestly. In Kansas we have a statute which prevents the sale of serum in that state which is not recognized by the experiment station authorities as being manufactured in a proper way and handled in a sanitary manner. Since the enforcement of this law we are having less trouble with impotent serum than before, but this law should be amended to give more authority with less red tape. Some owners have obtained materials to treat hogs with to prevent cholera, which were in no sense of the word serum, much leas anti-cholera serum, and cf course have almost universally met with disappointment. From all of the above it is easy to conclude that good serum has had its imitators, and that serum immunization of hogs has some enemies, but these are practically all persons who have never had any experience with potent serum properly applied by an experienced operator. I know this, for I have made it a practice to go into many communities where hog losses were high and where the owners were absolutely against the use of serum. By care in diagnosing and prognosing I have never failed to show the enormous value of the use of serum, and have invariably convinced every man I have worked for that it was efficient and did all that was claimed for it have also shown that it would prevent losses in diseased herds e the owners would not or could not see that cholera was at bottom of their losses. tit is gratifying to note that when potent serum is supplied by &gt;mpetent operator the losses from cholera in the herds treated practically nothing if no disease is present when the work is ormed. On sick herds the loss seldom runs high, but varies, the degree of infection and the sanitation of the quarters of •se bear a great weight in the final determination here. tl take it however that I am expected to deal rather exhaus - ?ly with the manufacture of the serum, and will therefore return that for a moment: In 1908 we first began the manufacture of am at the Kansas Station and have since that time constantly I our plant in operation, attempting to about meet the demand our swine breeders and foreseeing the demand rise and fall as t we could usually with such good success that no one was dis - &gt;ointed and no unusually large stock ever on hand. For a few weeks 1911, however, we failed to fill all our orders immediately they •e received, and it has not been always easy to handle the business </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE to the best of satisfaction when the demand suddenly increases. Under the old plan it was necessary to buy small susceptible pigs of from forty to eighty pounds weight and to make them sick with the cholera virus to obtain virus for hyperimmunizing purpose*. This was expensive, and often it was difficult to get these pigs in sufficient numbers to meet the demands for making the serum. It was necessary to improve our methods and several plans were tried. Finally with some doubt as to its success, but firmly convinced that we must devise some new plan for obtaining our virus, we went to the stockyards at Kansas City and looked over the sick pig supply and the facilities at the various packing establishments to draw this blood in a satisfactory manner. After trial we were convinced that the blood was all right but good facilities for drawing and caring for it in a proper manner could not be obtained in the average packing establishment. After waiting on many unfilled promises of the packers regarding better facilities, which never materialized, and in the meanwhile having the demands for serum increase, we were fortunate in receiving an offer from an independent packer to build and equip a plant after our plans and those of the Bureau of Animal Industry to slaughter these hogs under the supervision of our veter - inarian and the federal inspectors, to sell us this virus at what we consider a low price and give us the option of using only that which our inspector deems to come from a typical case of cholera in an acute form. We have now worked under this plan for considerable over a year and have been able to increase or lessen our output as the demand has occurred at a low cost and, according to our own ideas and the expressed opinion of the federal inspectors at Kansas City and of Dr. Dorset himself, have the satisfaction of drawing our virus in the finest laboratory devoted to this character of work in the country. With this arrangement we can keep on hand from 200 to 400 head of hyperimmunes. With our present output we have been able to market the serum at one and a half cents per cubic centimeter, pay every expense incident to its manufacture, and have Enall margin left for unforseen expenses and experimental work, t of which is very encouraging as to future improvements that can make in the product. There is also a likelihood that as process is perfected we can reduce the price materially from the ent one. I There may be some criticism of the virus obtained in the manner cribed, and I must confess that we ourselves had some misgivings to its feasibility, but after over a years work we have found the Led virus to be more uniformly virulent and much easier worked n where we try to deal with several strains separately. In a ill way this has been the experience of all who have made careful ervation of the mixed strains of virus. It has the marked ad - ltage of cheapening the product; it has enabled us to have an put of about seventy-five thousand dollars worth of serum the t year; it has enabled us to supply every request, and has made </seg>
            <seg id="p265">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 265 a uniformly potent product which has been used from Virginia to California; it has held hundreds of herds immune while an outbreal raged about them, saved thousands of head of swine and lessenec the cost of the years output to the buyer at least by thirty per cent Most of these results can be attributed in whole or part to the fact that the virus is obtained in a sanitary, carefully inspecte&lt; manner coupled with a few other details of minor importance now under trial, but if shown to be successful will assist in the improve ment of the product and will probably lessen the cost. tThe cost to the state has been about $3,000, which is invested buildings and equipment of laboratories. It was appropriated the legislature and is still sending serum out to the places where s most needed and returning to work in another locality at an - er time. In conclusion, I would suggest that a very high per cent, in fact nearly all,- of the hogs dying in the corn belt die of cholera in some of its forms. Remember that so far no material has proven itself capable of immunizing hogs against cholera except good, clean, potent anti-cholera serum. I In actual test serum has made it possible to raise hogs alone after steers in lots where previously it was impossible, and in ly cases it has been possible to raise pigs where the owner did believe that cholera had been his cause for previous failure. Waste no money on so-called hog tonics, stockfoods cholera cures, etc. Raise hogs if you wish and give just a little care to sanitation, and in case of losses, call early a good reliable person experienced in hog sanitation so that if cholera is starting you can get there with serum early enough to do some good. t Personally, I believe that it pays well in this country to im - nize all pigs at thirty to forty pounds weight when it can be le cheaply, whether cholera is actually near or not. It costs little any event, and in case cholera puts in an appearance in the ghborhood it is money well invested and gives a great many ners much mental relief from worry. I Lastly, remember that there are several ways to use serum, and sure that you use the proper form and know how to use it before i cast an opinion as to its efficiency. HOW TO MAKE THE FARM FLOCK MOST PROFITABLE By Chas. Lemlcy tl am afraid in assigning me this subject our chairman Mr. rvey, has placed a stumbling block in my way in that word lost". Had he said, "how to make the farm flock profitable," would have been easy, as the answer would have been, "get the m flock and the profit is sure"; but that word "moat" culls (or </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE te of the details and, in handling the farm flock as in all other i of business, it is looking after the little things that counts, and t will be impossible for me to mention all of these, I will only mpt to speak of a few of the larger and more important phases see this subject, and the smaller ones will gradually right thera - ;s as they come up. ■ If I were to advise a beginner, and it is from this light I wish speak for a few minutes this afternoon, for I fear I am too young a breeder to tell these older gentlemen much about the sheep - business, I would say first of all, select your breed. Attend the fairs and stock shows where sheep are exhibited, study the different breeds, select the one that comes the nearest suiting your particular fancy, and see how much easier it is to care for them than to get something you don't like just because a neighbor has that particular kind. It might be well to study conditions surrounding your location before selecting your breed, but most any breed when properly cared for will return more or less profit. Now, the question of thoroughbreds or grades: and I would say if you are going to start in with a small flock and let it increase as your reputation as a breeder grows, get the thoroughbreds by all means, for at this day and age of the world no man, whether he be breeding horses, cattle, hogs or sheep would think of using anything but a full-blooded, registered sire even though he has only a grade ewe dam; and why use this registered sire exclusively on this grade when the difference in the first cost would be but very little compared to the satisfaction of having a pedigreed, registered flock? You don't have to buy the fancy, highly-fed show sheep seen at the fairs and expositions at the prohibitive prices asked for them, but find some breeder of your chosen breed, one you think you can trust, and buy just good, plain, everyday ewes. They can be bought at a reasonable figure, and will do you more good than the show sheep. But if you wish to handle more than you can afford to buy of thoroughbreds, buy what thoroughbreds you can, and the rest grades, and in a few years your thoroughbreds will have absorbed your grade flock. If it hasn't, you have no business in the stock breeders world, for it is the desire to have something better than you already have, as well as something better than your neighbor, that is im - proving the live stock of this country today. If you have not that pride about you, you had better get out of the stock business before you ever start in. tNow, if you must have grades and grades only, buy the cheapest ewe you can find, for a grade is nothing but a scrub anyway, so ' pay high prices for a high grade scrub which you must invar - y do if you buy the high grade ewe? Then too, you can take poorest old range e*we you can find and cross her with a good opshire ram and, you would be surprised how fast they will le up; in a couple of crosses, you can have a bunch of grades that good enough for any man to own. It is true that a flock of high </seg>
            <seg id="p267">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 267 grades are nice to start in with and a paying investment on any farm, but for a man who is starting in grades I think the cheaper ewe will bring a larger return on the investment. You might ask why I say Shropshire ram, and accuse me of being partial to my breed, but I simply mentioned this breed because I have seen this tried and know just what results one might expect. A cross of this kind will produce feeder lambs that are market toppers and good shearers too, if you wish to keep the ewes for breeding purposes. And now the question arises, "How many do I want?" That depends on the size of your farm, amount of grass and pasture land available, general lay of the land, how much other stock you have around to use up th'e roughness that would otherwise go to waste, whether you wish to go into the business on a large or small scale, if situated so you can go into it extensively. You might ask what I mean by a large scale. I mean a man living on an eastern Ne - braska farm and keeping 400 to 500 breeding ewes. That might not seem like many to some present, but that is quite a bunch for an eastern Nebraska farm and much larger than the average. But I would say: Handle all you can, and take good care of them, for there is no profit in any stock that is half kept or poorly fed; and there is no profit on any farm where one-half or more of the rough - ness goes to waste every year. But one thing is a certainty, and that is a farm that has never had sheep on it will keep more the first year than it ever will again for there will be weed patches and fence corners as well as groves and feed lots to clean up, and the ewe and her lambs will do it without one half as much grumbling as the hired man, and grow and get fat in the meantime; but don't expect these sheep to hunt around for weeds to eat and let the clover and blue grass go to waste, for they won't do it unless that weed be a sun flower, for sheep do dearly love sun-flowers. They will nibble at any and all weeds and thus keep them down, but they won't pass up everything else to get to them. Treat your sheep as you do other stock on the farm that you expect a profit from, and not simply as scavengers, and they will prove money-makers and clean up the farm, too. Now, if you expect this farm to carry its maximum of sheep, it must be fenced and cross fenced; and for my part I think there is economy in a good fence, for there is noth - ing on the farm that there is as much satisfaction in having, unless it be a good team. A barbed wire fence can be made effective for sheep as well as all other kinds of stock, but a woven wire is so much better that there is no comparison whatever. tOn the farm where I live we have between 1700 and 1800 rods of ven wire on 240 acres which ranges in height from 20 to 45 inches, 1 it is needless to say that we consider the 45-inch fence the ■apest fence on the farm. With well set corners, a stretch of 42 45-inch fence of woven wire, with from 1 to 3 barbed wires on top, l have a field you can turn anything into and know where it is en night comes. Nor, do I consider it advisable to try to build </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 dog and coyote-proof fences for they must be much higher, must have cross bars on top of the posts with 4 or 5 barbed wires on them, must be in the ground 6 or 8 inches to keep them from digging under, gates must be perfectly tight, and then they will get in occasionally. Then too, my experience with the farm flock of native raised sheep has been that they will come home at nights anyway and lie in close around the buildings and are seldom bothered. It might be well to have a dog-proof corral to put them in if the dogs get to bothering, but I have never had one and have lost but one sheep or lamb with dogs. In early spring and summer when the lambs are small, I hang a lantern around the sheep pen for a month or two, especially on dark, rainy nights. This proves quite effective and is rather cheap insurance. Then another thing that will help keep a larger number of sheep, is sowing forage crops, such as rape in the corn, are available in the fall when feed is generally short. At the last cultivation, sow two pounds of rape to the acre broadcast, and the amount of feed you will get will be surprising and not at the expense of the corn crop either, for it seldom makes much of a growth until late in the fall after your corn is done growing. I have seen fields of corn that I think were benefited by the rape, it taking up the moisture, thus helping to mature earlier what would have been a very late piece of corn. Pumpkins are good sheep feed. I aim to keep more or less pumpkin seed in the planter boxes from the time I start in planting corn until I get through, and along the edges and across the ends I plant them thicker, as they can be gathered easier early in the fall. I very seldom lose a whole hill of corn. But what if you do? One good thrifty pumpkin vine will grow more fall feed than any hill of corn that ever grew. Last fall we picked twenty-six large pumpkins from a single vine and they made a good feed for sixty head of shoats, and would have made a feed for as many or more sheep. We haul the pumpkins in to the sheep only until we can get them into a shucked field, then we let them pick them themselves. And now, just a word as to hauling pumpkins to sheep. Load them and unload them so as to burst as few as possible, for when once broken dirt gets on the moist edges and the sheep won't eat them. They want their feed as clean as possible at all times. Let the sheep gnaw into the pumpkins themselves and they will eat them up clean. If you have a thin place in the corn or along the edge, a few turnip seed scattered here later in the season will make considerable feed, and the sheep will pull them themselves and be glad to get the job. If we were eastern sheepmen, I suppose all of these turnips along with other roots and vegetables would be pulled and put in cellars for winter and spring feed, but as long as we Nebraskans have such large acreages of corn, oats and alfalfa, I am afraid we will rely on them for our winter and spring feeds; and although, I speak from absolute inexperience, I doubt if they can be beaten to any extent when fed properly and in the right proportions. </seg>
            <seg id="p269">269 tNow let us look for a few of the smaller things that in the end ht mean the larger things. Study your flock as to each in - dual's producing power, keep only the ewes that are the regular iucers; and for me, the ones that raise the twins and triplets, ave gone still further and produced a ewe that had and raised ' lambs, and I am striving to turn the trick again, or do even ,er. t Flush the ewes, that is turn them on good pastures three o • weeks before breeding time to have them in a good, thrivin dition at mating time. Use only good strong rams that wer is. Keep your ewes in good condition during the winter months /e your lambs come when you can take good care of them :p your flock free from worms and disease. Some claim they don" it twins nor triplets in their lambs, but I do. A single lam ht be all right if you want something big and large for show pur es, but some of the best lambs I ever saw were twins. On Monday preceding the mid-winter sheep show in Omaha, I shipped a carload of lambs to South Omaha that were purchased by Cudahy &amp; Co. They picked five of the weather lambs and showed them in the fat classes at the show. One of these lambs was from m set of triplets, and I am not sure but that two of them were. In summing this up from my way of thinking, I would say, select your breed of suitable size according to size and general lay of your farm. Fence and cross fence it so as to use every foot of it; plant and sow every nook and corner to get it to produce its greatest amount of feed and keep sheep enough to consume all of this and all of the extra feed your neighbor wishes to sell, and you will have the best paying investment in the neighborhood. Now, the beginner might ask, "What profit might I expect from these ewes?" In the first place there is one crop you are sure of, that is the wool. This varies in price and weight of fleece, but will run from $1.10 or $1.20 to $2.50 or more per head on an average. I sheared $17 of wool that sold for twenty-five cents per pound from a ewe that cost me $5.60, leaving the ewe cost me $1.35, and she raised me two lambs that same year. I sheared a flock of fifty-six head that year that cost me $5.60 on an average and got $2.50 per head in wool. A neighbor bought 100 head that same year at $5.14 per head delivered at home, and sheared $3.12 per head on an average, and raised around 100', of lambs, leaving his ewes cost him at shearing time $1.02. These instances are the income from the wool only. Last year I raised thirty lambs from twenty-two ewes. The lambs weighed 120 pounds in Omaha and sold for $6.75 per hundred, bringing me $8.10 each. They were from grade ewes which were worth from $7.00 to $8.00 each. Another instance, the ewe with the four lambs when I shipped them to Omaha, the combined weight of the four was about 320 pounds, and my load sold for $6.15, which would mean about six cents net, or very near it, making them worth $19.20 which is a fair income from about a $6.00 ewe. </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 Here is another instance of a fellow who bought a few very cheap range ewes like I spoke about some few minutes ago. He bought eleven at $1.25 per head, making a total of $13.75. He told me himself that if he had sold all of the lambs at the time he sold the weather lambs he would have sold $75.00 worth of wool and lambs from a $13.75 investment, and he had ten of the original eleven ewes left. You might say, "Yes, but these are out of the ordinary. You have picked out the instances where the big profits were abnormal and above the average." They may be above the average, they would have to be to impress themselves upon one's mind so as to remember these particular instances, but they are instances that have come under my own observation and are not impossible, for what has been done can be done again, and nothing is impolsible at this day and age of the world. A BUSHEL OF WHEAT S. C. Bassett Every story is entitled to a name; sometimes its name is its most interesting feature. The name of this story is "A Bushel o Wheat." Every story is entitled to a birth-place, a time and plac of beginning; many stories begin by saying, "Once Upon a Time;' let it be known that the birth-place of this story was in the kingdom of Germany and about the year 1780. At that date there waa living in the kingdom of Germany a religious sect who maintainec that "Christians should not bring lawsuits, demand interest, tak oaths, nor serve as soldiers." I It is most interesting to read and to observe with what tenacity purpose people who have what is sometimes termed "conscien - is scruples" cling to their particular belief and how often, un - tingly, such people have been so largely useful in the world. Witness the coming to this country of the pilgrim fathers or "Puritans" in 1620. Every one knows why they came; the real purpose of their coming is beautifully and graphically described by Mrs. Hemans in a poem with which all are familiar, and one verse of which it seems appropriate to quote: "What sought they thus afar? Bright jewels of the mine? The wealth of seas? The spoils of war? They sought a faith's pure shrine." I Witness the migration of the Mormons in 1847, across what then believed to be a desert extending from the Missouri river the Rocky mountains and their settlement at Salt Lake, which ntry they named the "State of Deseret" — the meaning of which </seg>
            <seg id="p271">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 271 would seem to be— the land of the desert, although the Mormons claim that in the language of their sacred books the word means honey-bee or industry; in this migration they doubtless believec that the desert on the one side and almost impassible mountains on the other, would prove a barrier to advancing civilization, an&lt; where they fondly believed that for generations to come they migh be permitted to observe undisturbed, the principles and teachings of their religious belief. They made the desert where they located — their State of Deseret, to bio 3 m and blossom as the rose and wer themselves the forerunners, the pioneers, in the settlements am development of the great west beyond the Missouri, a land possesse&lt; of marvelous wealth and almost boundless resources. The settlemen of the Mormon people at Salt Lake hastened the day when our na tion, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific should be bound together with bands of steel — a great transcontinental railroad, thus enlarging our power and influence and ensuring our perpetuity as one of the great nations of the world. Rather than go contrary to the principles of their religious belief, rather than do military duty, this religious sect (Mennonites), whose home was in the kingdom of Germany, decided to seek a home else- I Catherine the II, empress of Russia, having need of such people — ustrious, frugal, peaceful — sent emissaries offering that in case y would settle in Russia, lands would be granted them and an aerial decree issued relieving them of military duty. Then it was it this sect emigrated in a body and established new homes in that •t of Russia bordering on the Black sea, along the Dneiper river, the province of Kherson and adjoining provinces. tProf. F. W. Taylor, well known to many Nebraska people, who veling in this section of Russia and acting for the University of braska, first brought to this country and state seed of the now ious Kherson oats, states that in soil, in climate — including rain - and other climatic conditions affecting agriculture — this portion Russia is similar, almost identical with like conditions in Nebraska 1 Kansas. When a century had come and gone, the imperial decree reliev - ing these people and their descendants from military service was revoked, and the imperial authorities informed them that inasmuch as they were now citizens of Russia it was their duty to help to fight Russia's battles. Although this land had been the home of these people for many generations, and they had fondly hoped to leave it as a heritage to their children, to their decendants, yet they were still strong in the faith of their fathers, and rather than sacrifice what they believed to be a vital principle in their religious belief they sought a home elsewhere. In the early '70's a colony of them came to Nebraska, camping for some time on the state fair grounds at Lincoln while arrangements were being made to secure a body of land for their </seg>
            <seg id="p272">272 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Eement as, like all colonies of emigrants they were clannish, in - d to herd together. In their emigration they brought their belongings, among other things "a bushel of wheat" of a variety principally grown in that portion of Russia from whence they came; this was a variety or kind known as winter wheat, sown in the fall of the year, whereas all wheat grown in Nebraska at that date was of the spring variety, sown in the spring of the year. This "bushel of wheat" was sown and proved to be hardy — living through the winter without protec - tion even of snow, was seemingly well adapted to our soil and climate and yielded well. Beginning in this experimental way and with so small a quantity of seed, although it continued to be sown each year, the acreage increased very slowly, and it was nearly twenty years, about the year 1892, before the growing of this wheat (Turkey Red) began to receive really serious attention at the hands of the milling interests of the state; up to that date — 1892 — all attempts at milling this wheat resulted in producing a dark colored flour of low grade in the market, and the yield of flour per bushel was less than that of spring wheat. In the year 1892 the growing of this variety of wheat in a few counties had reached such proportions that C. C. White, an enterprising, progressive citizen, residing at Crete and engaged in the milling business, began systematic experimentation in the milling of wheat, and it was interesting to hear Mr. White relate his efforts and experience along the line. His head miller was not at all in sympathy with the experiments and said "the wheat waa no good for milling purposes and the farmers were blamed fools for raising it," only he did not say "blamed." It was found that by running the wheat through a heater, thus heating it, then damp - ening with water, then running the heated and dampened wheat into a tempering bin where it remained for two or three hours, the absorb - ing of the moisture toughened the bran, when after giving the wheat a second scouring by machinery and using the roller method of grinding, and making some changes in machinery used, there could be manufactured as large a percentage of flour as from spring wheat, but the flour was of a dark color and also the bread made from the flour. (Then it was that Prof. Samuel Avery, chemist at Nebraska versity (now Chancellor Avery) and Prof. F. J. Alway, also a ■nist, began investigations looking to the bleaching of flour by .ns of an electric current, the result of these and other like in - igations being that our millers were able to manufacture from this at a high grade flour, standard for quality and color, thus meet - the demands of the commercial market. t Gluten is the most valuable and important element in wheat, in ir and in bread making. It is said of gluten, "it is so highly ritious that animals can live upon it probably longer than upon ' other single nutritive material." Gluten in wheat varies from o 35 per cent of the grain according to soil, where grown, variety wheat and conditions of growth. </seg>
            <seg id="p273">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 273 tBut as valuable as is gluten in the flour of wheat, the quality ie gluten is of far greater importance than the quantity. An ority on this question not only from the standpoint of the millini ests but those who make and bake bread as well says: "It is sufficient to know the quantity of gluten in flour, but more cularly is it necessary to know the character theieof. I Flour may contain a large per cent of gluten, and not posses desired quality. * * • Practical and analytical experiments o r for bread making have demonstrated that patent flour contain en of more proper proportion of gliadin to glutenin, thus denoting etter quality than other grades, the gliadin giving elasticity to dough and producing a larger loaf of bread. * * * It has been y demonstrated that flour of the patent roller process makin a greater power of digestibility and imparts more energy than entire wheat or graham flour. From the hard spring wheats of the Dakotas and Minnesota is made the standard patent spring wheat flour of greatest excellence in our commercial markets, and from the hard winter wheats of Nebraska and Kansas is made the standard patent winter wheat flour of greatest excellence in the commercial markets. The only difference in the flour made from these two varieties of wheat is that the flour of the winter wheat has a slightly darker color, which can easily and cheaply be removed or changed by a harmless bleaching process. This darker color in the hard winter wheat is caused by the presence of a very small per cent of oil found in both spring and winter wheat, this oil in spring wheat being colorless. When this oil, which in Turkey red winter wheat is of dark color, is extracted from the wheat or flour and placed in a glass and hung in the sun - light it soon loses its dark color and becomes colorless. At Minneapolis, Minn., is centered the largest milling interests in the United States if not in the world. The St. Anthony falls i the Mississippi river furnish water power estimated at 129,000 hors power. Tributary to this point is all the world's famous hard sprin wheat grown in the great spring wheat producing states of Nort Dakota, Minnesota and South Dakota, which states, in the year 1911 produced 93 per cent of all the hard spring wheat grown in th United States, North Dakota being the leading wheat producin state in the union. I From this hard spring wheat the Minneapolis mills have been nufacturing for years what has been recognized in the markets the world as the standard of excellence in high grade flour. When the improved methods in milling and by means of the harmless aching of the flour made from Nebraska and Kansas grown winter eat, such flour took rank in the commercial markets for quality i excellence equal to the highest grades of flour manufactured at i Minneapolis mills, the milling interests centered at Minneapolis lized that in such Nebraska and Kansas wheat flour they had a *erful rival in the commercial markets, and they became jealous </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE nd started the bug-a-boo story that bleaching of flour by means of n electric current was in effect an adulteration, and also that the se of such flour was deleterious to health, in all of which statements nere is not even a grain of truth; for when Chemists Avery and Alway began their investigations of the bleaching process, one of lie first considerations to be determined was to ascertain if flour so treated would prove deleterious to health in its use. Their in - estigations and chemical analyses demonstrated to themselves and thers that the process was harmless as affecting in any manner the ealthfulness of the flour as a food product. It is now nine years nee began the bleaching process of flour by this method, and while ruling of the United States department of agriculture, under the ational pure food act, does not permit the interstate shipment and ale of such bleached flour, the people of Nebraska, Kansas and ad - oining states which grow and mill this 'variety of wheat have been sing this bleached flour, and no one can offer an iota of evidence or roof that in all these years the use of this flour has proven harmful r deleterious to health. SUMMING UP THE RESULTS I The coming of "a bushel of wheat" to Nebraska from far-away ussia, brought with other household belongings by a religious sect, e members of which would rather move on and on, would rather ■ wanderers on the face of the earth without a fixed and permanent &gt;iding place than do violence to the principles of their religious ith, rather than do military service, the coming of "a bushel of heat," bringing in its train wealth and prosperity, comfort and ippiness to more than a million of the people of Nebraska, was in e year 1875. It was almost twenty years later, in the year 1892, that the production of this wheat first began to attract the serious attention of our farmers and our milling interests. In the year 1892 and previous years practically all wheat raised in Nebraska- was of the spring variety, the same varieties raised in the Dakotas and Minnesota. In 1909 only 8 per cent of the wheat raised was spring wheat, 92 per cent being of the Russian variety of winter wheat. In the ten-year period — 1886-1895 — the average yield per acre of wheat was 10.8 bushels. In the ten-year period — 1900-1909 — the average yield per acre was 17.8 bushels, an increase in yield per acre of seven bushels or an increase of 65 per cent. In the 'year 1892 the average value per acre of wheat raised was $5.40; in the year 1909 the average value per acre of wheat aised was $15.94, the average home market price per bushel in 1892 &gt;eing 49.9 cents and in 1909 the average price (home market) per &gt;ushel being 89 cents, an increase of 78.3 per cent in price per bushel and an increase in the value per acre of the crop of 195 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">275 I the year 1892 the acreage was 1,255,564. In the year 1909 the eage was 2,665,000, an increase of 115 per cent. There was pro - ved in the year 1892, 15,670,000 bushels. There was produced the year 1909 (U. S. census), 47,686,000 bushels, an increase in duction, in bushels, of 204 per cent. In the year 1892 the value the wheat crop was $7,834,000; in the year 1909 the value of the eat crop was $42,444,000, an increase in value of 441 per cent eliminate the difference in prices as between the year 1892 am 19 it can be said, had the wheat crop of the state for the yea 12 been sold at the same price as was the crop of 1909 (89 cents) that basis the value of the 1909 crop would have exceeded the ue of the 1892 crop by $28,944,000, or an increase in value o r per cent. I It seems a conservative estimate to make that the introduction the bringing hard variety of winter wheat from Russia into Ne ska has added to the yearly income of the state from the growing wheat alone approximately $25,000,000. It is quite certain tha re would have been very little increase in the acreage of sprin eat in that portion of the state now devoted to the raising o iter wheat, as the yield of spring wheat did not pay, one yea h another, much above the cost of production. Also it is reason e to conclude that there would have been no marked increase i Id per acre of spring wheat, as we have no longer a virgin soi h as we had when spring wheat was more largely grown. I There is another interesting feature in connection with the history this wheat and its introduction into our state, and that is the .ptability of a plant to its surrounding conditions. As has been before stated, the soil and climatic conditions — including rainfall — in that section of Russia from whence this wheat came to us, is similar to, almost identical with like conditions existing in Nebraska; and as this variety of wheat has been grown for a century, at least, in that section of Russia it had become acclimated, had adapted itself to the conditions surrounding its growth from year to year, and the perpetuation of its species, and this is the reason why it has proven well adapted to our soil and our climates. We, Nebraskans, are reaping the benefit of all those years of prepara - tion for our use, in Russia, of this remarkable variety of wheat. I It has a small per cent of foliage, hence requires or can thrive the minimum amount of moisture required by the wheat plant, ripens early, about July 1, hence gets the full benefit of that period which our rainfall is most abundant and most certain from year year. tSo adapted has this variety of wheat become to conditions, jrable and unfavorable, which prevail in our state, so intensely i has it been in these respects, that in the year 1912, when con - ons were so unfavorable In many localities at the period when tat is said to "shoot," to head out, that the wheat plant ceased grow. In some instances only the beards of the head emerged </seg>
            <seg id="p276">276 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE from the boot or sheath. In other instances even the beards did not appear; still some such fields produced a fairly good crop of wheat — a fairly good yield. J. C. Hedge, in the milling business at Hastings, and R. A. Davis, in the milling business at Gibbon, both state that wheat so produced was of the finest milling quality and entirely free of what is called "yellow berry," a condition which, when it exists in wheat, makes it less valuable for milling purposes. That Nebraska grown, hard, winter wheat finds favor with the milling interests at Minneapolis is best evidenced by the shipment in the year ending June 30, 1912, over one line of railroad only (the Burlington), of approximately one and one-half million bushels of Nebraska winter wheat to Minneapolis, there to be milled into flour. In November last there was held in Minneapolis an exposition of the products of the northwest. Among the prizes offered was one of $5,000 for the best five bushels of wheat exhibited. This great and valuable prize was awarded to an exhibit of Turkey red wheat as shown by the following press dispatch: "MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Dec. 11.— Joseph P. Nash and Charles Bridgeman, of the firm of Nash &amp; Bridgeman, Clyde Park, Mont., today were awarded the $5,000 first prize for the best five bushels of wheat exhibited at the northwestern products exhibition held here in November." This grain, which is of the Turkey red variety, was grown in the Shield river valley, seventy miles north of Yellowstone Park. The grain went slightly over sixty pounds to the bushel, and in grading received a score of 92 i. In laboratory tests, however, which consisted of milling and baking, the grain received a score of 104.7." The laboratory test is the most critical and important of all, and it will be noticed that in the laboratory test this variety of wheat scored more than perfect, (104.7). In the laboratory and baking test is determined the quality of the gluten, and on the quality of the gluten depends to a considerable extent the per cent of water which the flour will absorb in the process of making bread (an aver - age of about 60 per cent); in the laboratory and baking test is determined the number of pound-loaves of bread to the barrel (196 pounds) of flour (ranges from 306 to 310 loaves) — the averages above given being for flour known as Patent Hard, Spring and Winter. Since the coming of "a bushel of wheat" in the beginning, there have been numerous importations of this variety from Russia for seed purposes and the variety is becoming more, and more popular each year. There is one interesting feature in connection with the spreading of this wheat into other states and localities, the usual method being to introduce seed from a locality having a shorter growing season, with us from the north to the south; in the case of the spreading of this wheat the customary rule has been reversed. Introduced first in the early '70's into Kansas and Nebraska, the growing of this </seg>
            <seg id="p277">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 277 Eiat has spread to the north and northwest, the prize wheat exhibit Minneapolis, before mentioned, coming from a point in Montana te 800 miles to the north and west of the point of its first intro - tion into this country some forty years ago. NEBRASKA STATE BEEKEEPERS' ASSOCIATION LINCOLN, JANUARY 22, 1913 PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS By The Vary Reverend Alois J. Klein, Vicar-General Diocese of Lincoln tin occupying the chair and calling the meeting of the Nebraska i Beekeepers' Association to order, I wish to greet you on this ;th anniversary of this association and congratulate you on its period of usefulness. I had hoped to see a number of faces of those who have at - tended these meetings since the early days of the society, though the number grows annually less. This year we miss a once familiar face, that of Mr. Wm. Steinhoff, late president of this association; and as we realize that it is to be for aye, we are glad to remember how pleasant his fellowship with us had always been. tin spite of the poor season which we have had last year, it cannot denied that apiculture is making rapid progress in our state, and t it forms already one of the important branches of agriculture. :h a view of fostering and extending the knowledge of the pos - lities of this industry in our state, I beg to submit a few sugges - ts in this, my opening address, hoping thereby to further the srests of the Nebraska beekeepers. I II am making the proposition of having introduced into the nentary public schools or rural districts the teaching of apiculture, else making beekeeping form a part of the country school cur - ilum. The difficulty "how could the schoolmasters and mistresses eh the subject, not knowing it?" would present itself. Such tacles can be overcome by giving them a series of lectures and nonstrations. Highly trained men and women can be taught a ject, or rather, the elementary portion of it, in a very little time, ay are apt pupils, and their enthusiasm for the subject is easily used. The schools could be supplied with one or more up-to-date es and colonies of bees, with some veils and a smoker, while the ractor would go from school to school. An observatory hive could be procured, which would prove an ex - cellent educative feature, the children being able to observe the bees </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE at work in every detail. The children should be taken to the colonies, and practical lessons given according to the time of the year. Such teaching is bound to bear fruit in time, since recollections and im - pressions taken at such an age are lasting. tSuch a system of teaching apiculture is already in vogue in r states and countries in a limited way, and it has proven of : value. II I also propose that the proper authorities be requested to make arrangements for the establishment of special courses of practical lectures and demonstrations in beekeeping in the Agricultural College of Nebraska by the regular University staff and by apicultural experts of the state, the courses to be so designed as to embrace a practical survey of the maintenance of bees, not only for their products, but as an adjunct to modern apiculture. This subject has already been recommended by previous sessions of this associa - tion, in view of which fact I desire to again urge that it be brought to the attention of the proper authorities. Let us hope that this matter will materialize some day and not remain a mere "pium desiderium," i. e. a mere pious wish. Ill IOur beloved association ought to try again to secure the passage the Nebraska legislature of the foul brood inspection law which i favorably reported at the last session. Through the untiring &gt;rts of our scholarly and efficient secretary, Mr. Odell, the neces- I for an appropriation to fight bee diseases was made plain in per places. American foul brood, bacillus larvae (white), is present in nearly every county of the state and is causing total loss of thousands of dollars every year. It threatens the extermination of the bee in - dustry, but on the other hand, can be readily controlled under competent inspection. We shall ask that the state entomologist be officially charged with this duty in conformity with the system which now prevails in a majority of the honey-producing states. tThe bill is ready to present to the state legislature, and has the support of the entire beekeeping fraternity. It is to be hoped we may be able to convince our representatives that they should it in the interest of this important branch of agriculture. bin my judgment, legislation should be asked, prohibiting the iportation of bees from one county to another, or from other s, without a certificate of inspection. IV t[ also desire to call the attention of the members of our state ty to considering the matter of joining the National Beekeepers' ciation, and start a new era as a national branch, which will </seg>
            <seg id="p279">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 279 Ible every member to get full national and branch benefits, as 1 as a subscription to the Review, all for $1.50 annually. There 10 reason why every beekeeper should not be a national member &gt;ugh a national branch and thus not only help finance the na - al work, but get a splendid publication which will keep him in e touch with what is going on in the way of organization work. Beekeeping has been called the poetry of agriculture. Even the most humble and commonplace apiary has about it a touch of the picturesque, while the modern apiary, with its white hives dotting a shady lawn in semblance of a miniature village, forms a picture upon which the eye loves to linger. tWhat a pleasure to see the exhilaration of swarming time, when after hive, becoming filled to overflowing, pours forth its count - throng of busy workers, eager for the one holiday of their lives, they circle and whirl and gyrate, filling the air with that pecu - cutting, "swarming note," so quickly recognized by the practised and, at last, hanging themselves up in a great, golden-brown er upon the branch of some neighboring tre*-, ready to be gath - in by the apiarist and furnished a new home in which to build dainty white combs and fill them with nectar gathered from beautiful flowers. There is not a beekeeper who has not stepped back and stood for at least a moment lost in silent admiration after the harvest is over and past, at the product of the season, packed in neat shipping cases with glass fronts, at the stands stacked up in the honey house or elsewhere, ready for shipment. I And when the bees have enjoyed their last autumnal flight, am ■n prepared for winter on their summer stands, or been snugge&lt; ay in the cellar for their long winter nap, if one steps into thei reat and quietly listens, there comes to the ear a faint, sof rmur of content, that can be compared only to the whisperings the wind at midnight in the tops of tall pines. tin conclusion I beg to exhort you to have hope and confidence our pursuit. Let us be boosters. It will help the good cause i i will tell of the good things of the industry, forgetting its short nings. Every time you speak good or evil of your occupation, a &gt;d or bad impression is spread broadcast. I thank you heartily the opportunity of outlining my views and wishes on behalf o ' state association. BACK YARD BEEKEEPING State Bee Keepers' Association, Gentlemen: I feel highly honored by receiving -an invitation n your Secretary, Mr. Frank Odell, to write a paper to be read this meeting of your association. By Sergeant H. C. Cook, Omaha, Neb </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I am requested to write my experiences in bee keeping in a city back lot. As these cover a period of only six years, it is easy to be seen that I am not an expert, but I will be pleased to give to the association an account of my experiences and ideas of the possibilities of pleasure and profit in keeping bees or a small scale. I want to ■ay right here that no amateur beekeeper should get the idea that he knows all there is to be known without the experience of older men in the business. The very first thing a new beekeeper should do, and the best investment he can make is to buy some good books on the subject, written by men of long experience and of national reputation such as Doolittle, Alexander, Townsend, Dr. Miller, Langstroth, and others. After he has made himself familiar with the works of these men, he can experiment along the lines of any branch of the business he may choose, such as queen rearing, swarm con - trol, or the different methods of producing comb and extracted honey, and after his experimenting he may be able to map out a plan of his own which perhaps would suit him better than the plan of any of the gentlemen mentioned, by drawing from the experiences of all of them. I There are few people, either in the business or out of it who ze the extent of profit in bee culture which can be made from a 1 piece of ground properly handled. I have a small apiary on a plot of ground 50 x 60 feet from which I have produced a net profit of from $500 to $800 each year for the last three years. Last spring when I took my bees from the cellar I had forty-eight colonies. I sold $106 worth of bees and lost two colonies, which left me thirty. From these thirty colonies I produced thirty-five cases of comb honey, which I sold for $3.50 for twenty-four sections without cases, and twenty-five hundred pounds of extracted honey which I put up in half-gallon jars, and sold for $1.00 a jar. I sold $40 worth of beeswax, made from crooked and bad combs, and in - creased my bees from thirty to sixty-eight colonies. My income for the season was $684.00, besides my increase of thirty-eight colonies of bees, and my expenses did not exceed $50. I am working the bees simply as a side line, and keeping up my regular business of sergeant of police. From this it is easy to see the profit that can be made if bees are handled carefully, as last year was only a very ordinary season for honey. Few people -ealize to what extent bee culture is carried on in cities by professional men and business men as a matter of pleasure and entertainment, in order to divert their minds from their business and profession. In the city of Omaha there are probably one thou - sand colonies of bees, most of them in apiaries of from two to ten colonies, very few of which are kept for the purpose of making money. I do not know of any hobby that is more entertaining; and to a person who is well enough acquainted with the bees to know the many manipulations which can be made with them for profit and experience, they are an ever interesting occupation to turn to in </seg>
            <seg id="p281">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 281 Ire moments. I seldom meet a man in the business, large or 1, who has made a study of it, and knows the possibilities of bees, who is not what the ordinary person would be inclined to a crank on the subject. His enthusiasm is unlimited, and a very &gt; percentage of beekeepers would prefer to talk bees to any other ect, myself being no exception. There is a great deal written in books and papers about winter - ing bees. Each beekeeper seems to have his own ideas about this, and I suppose that I have a right to mine, and begging the patience of the members here present, I will relate my preference. I am extremely partial to cellar wintering. I have had four years' experience and imagine that I have improved each year. The past two years I have lost but one colony in the cellar. The first year, however, was different. I made my cellar and arranged everything as nearly as I could according to the instructions of big beekeepers on the subject. I put thirty colonies of bees in the cellar, and when I took them out in the spring there were but seven living. This did not discourage me with cellar wintering, however, and I tried some plans of my own which have worked successfully. There are four objects to be obtained in perfect cellar wintering. The bees must be kept in absolute darkness, in a temperature between forty and fifty degrees, forty-five degrees being about the right point, with good ventilation, so that they may have pure dry air, and they must be kept as quiet as possible. When these conditions are observed, it makes no difference whether they are wintered in a cellar, barn or garret. They will ordinarily not consume within ten pounds as much honey in the cellar as they would do outdoors, and where one has forty or more colonies the amount of honey saved in one winter will pay for the building of the cellar. There is one very important matter which the backyard bee - keeper should never lose sight of and that is to be in good standing with all of his neighbors. Occasionally a man will find a neighbor who is disposed to be cranky on the subject of bees, and perhaps finds more or less fault with beekeeping in a city back lot. While such persons would probably not be in a position to do any very great harm, still they could make it quite annoying. I understand that cases have been tried in nearly all the courts in the United States, trying to have city apiaries moved outside of town, but I do not know of any case on record where this has been done. The backyard apiarist, however, should avoid any of this sort of trouble by sweetening his neighbors. He should always be ready and willing to donate to his immediate neighbors some nice honey, and always five the very best that he can produce. He will derive a benefit from two directions by this, as he will make a good fellow out of his neighbor, and if the honey is exceptionally nice, the neighbor will boost it with everybody he comes in contact with. The backyard apiarist as a rule depends on the retail trade to dispose of his products, and for this reason he should use every </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE effort to make his product as attractive as anything to be found on the market, and, being a local producer, he will thereby command iittle better price than outside people, everyone supposing that ley produced in "our apiary" is superior to any produced else - ere. He should always see that his extracted honey is put up neat, tasty jars, labeled with attractive labels; and by all means, er allow a single section of comb honey to leave the apiary with - being thoroughly cleaned of all bee glue or other stain which [ht appear on the frame. One more point which is of vital interest to all bee keepers in the State of Nebraska I would like to touch upon here — the subject of foul brood. While this does not amount to a great deal to a man understanding his business, still it is a great inconvenience and annoyance, and unless there are some laws made and properly en - forced to compel the careless man to take care of his dead and affected colonies, there will be no end to this annoyance. A man accustomed to handling foul brood can cure it in a very short time; and with the modern methods, it is not necessary to lose either brood, bees or honey. I have tried several plans myself and am partial to what is known as the Baldrige plan, namely, to remove the old stand and put a new hive in its place, fill with sheets of founda - tion, and cage the queen in this hive, allowing the field bees to go into this stand as they come in from the fields. In the evening of the day you make the manipulation, release the queen. Then set the old hive by the side of the new one, with a bee escape in the entrance to allow the bees to come out as they mature, and in twenty-one days all the bees will have hatched out, and having no place to go, will enter the new hive, thereby strengthening it and making it able to produce a surplus of honey. If this manipulation is done about the commencement of the honey flow and a super of extracting combs put on over a queen excluder at the time of the manipulation, they will store honey to compare favorably Vith any colony in the apiary and be thoroughly cured of the disease. I hope that all beekeepers throughout the state will use their best efforts in bringing about conditions which will relieve us of this plague, in the way of proper legislation. I may have wandered from my subject somewhat, which was supposed to be "Beekeeping in a City Back- Yard" but as I said before, a beekeeper who once gets on his favorite topic does not know where to stop, as one could talk for hours on the subject and then not do it justice. I thank you for your kind attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p283">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 283 MARKETING HONEY I fully realize the importance of this subject and your secretary could doubtless have chosen someone more experienced in this subject than I. If there are those present who have mastered this problem and now have an established trade for their product, these few lines will possibly not appeal. ■ On the other hand there may be some who are not realizing they should get from the sale of their honey. ■ First, I want to take up the general condition of the market we found it the past season. I Large producers in the most favored localities are changing from production of comb to that of extracted honey. The result is oversupply of the latter with a tendency towards lower prices, a scarcity of the best grades of comb honey. » There is a tendency of large buyers of comb honey to quit hand - [ it owing to the breakage in shipment and the seeming indifference producers to properly grade and pack their product. This latter dition will drive comb honey out of the market unless remedied better methods of marketing on the part of producers. comb honey producer, who will take the extra care and s to properly put up his product is assured of a good market the next few seasons at least. I Some few years ago I began making a display of bees and honey the annual State Fair, and as a result of this I was able to find outlet for all the comb honey I could produce. These displays apiarian products bring before the public the importance of the keeping industry. City merchants are attracted by the nice &gt;earance of honey, put up for show purposes and in competition premium money. Thus the result is the sale of the entire lot display at a good price. L Customers gained in this way usually buy year after year, if ted properly. I The premium money usually pays all expense of the show, and one is fortunate in getting up the best display, the winnings ount to a nice little sum. I The result of this annual exhibit at fairs was that I must pro - e both comb and extracted honey in order to make a creditable wing. I Not being able to dispose of all the extracted at the close of h fair, I began to build up a home market for the residue, ch heretofore could not be considered in marketing liquid honey. LA campaign of education was begun, to remove the prejudice possible customers and in case of a sale, explaining the tendency extracted honey to candy and the method of liquefying, the lit of which was a large increased demand for the extracted honey. Thot. Atkinson, Cozad, Nebr. </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The present winter I have disposed of some 2,000 pounds where a few seasons ago I had no calls for this honey. Owing to the condition of the home market in regard to comb honey I ship all my comb to the city, and sell the extracted direct to the consumer at a good advance over what I would receive from the city buyer. Competition between farmer beekeepers has practically ruined the mark -t in small towns for the specialist. I receive more from the jobbe. than the small town merchant is willing to pay; besides he gets the farmers honey at his own price, and pays for it with goods. You are asked to do the same. In building up a trade on honey we should take into considera - tion that our product is a luxury, and beyond a certain price the average person will not buy. While the rich may buy at any price, there are thousands who never taste honey from one year to another, partly because of the prohibitive price, which the dealer puts on after it leaves the hands of the producer; and still there are those who do not buy simply because honey is not brought prominently before them. These latter can be reached by a systematic campaign of advertising. Shipments of comb honey for the city market require special care. First the comb must be fastened to all sides of the section, thoroughly cleaned of propolis and put into new shipping cases. The fancy grade should be enclosed in a paper carton which protects the honey from dirt and flies after it reaches the retailer. The inferior grades should not be put up in cartons as it would be a detriment to the business, and create a wrong impression in the mind of the buyer. There seems to be some difference of opinion among the buyers and producers in regard to the grading rules for comb honey, but I have successfully followed the plan of placing myself in the posi - tion of the buyer while grading my section honey, forgetting for the time being that I am owner of the honey, and trying to have all sections in each case as nearly alike as possible, so that the mer - chant will not have some inferior sections on hand after his cus - tomers have chosen out the most desirable. In preparing the cases for shipment six or eight are placed in a carrier, with a straw cushion underneath. The idea is to have enough weight so the freight handlers can not throw the crate around like you would a small box of light weight. Section honey prepared as above should ship any reasonable distance with very little breakage, in fact I have never had a com - plaint from a customer on account of breakage. My experience in a nutshell is: Produce the best possible grade of both comb and extracted honey. Sell all you can in your home market direct to the con - sumer. Ship your comb honey before cold weather, and advertise your business whenever the chance presents itself. </seg>
            <seg id="p285">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 285 The marketing game is a deep one. It is one of the future problems of the apiarist to eliminate as far as possible the parasite who lives from the toil of both producer and consumer, and whose ultimate removal will benefit both in increased profits to the former and cheaper food for the latter. It is said that the beekeeper is of a very hopeful nature and being one whose fever is high I am hoping for the best and believing firmly in the future. MAINTAINING THE FERTILITY OF WESTERN NEBRASKA SOIL By W. P. Snyder, Superintendent, North Platte Experimental Substation, North Platte, Nebraska I shall not take your time to quote authorities in proof of state - ments, the truth of which you will all readily admit. There are certain elements in the soil which are essential to plant growth. If a soil contains all of these elements and no injurious elements it is considered fertile. If it is deficient in any one of these essen - tials, it is a sterile soil. The total productive capacity of a soil is measured by the amount of the element having the least relative amount of plant food, just as the strength of a chain is measured by the strength of its weakest link. Phosphorus, potash and nitro - gen are the three elements that are likely to be lacking in sufficient quantities. A soil may have a surplus of any two of these, and a deficiency of one. The element having the lowest relative amount of plant food will determine the total possible production of that soil. The soil in western Nebraska has an abundant supply of all the essential elements, save one. This one is nitrogen. Therefore the only element in the soil that concerns us, is nitrogen. Even this element is in a sufficient quantity in the virgin soil to produce 25 or 30 crops before any lessening of the yield is noticed. The oldest fields are now showing a decrease in yield, according to reports of men who have farmed their fields 25 or 30 years continuously without applying any fertilizer. On these farms the problem of maintaining or supplying nitrogen confronts the farmer. However on the new land, the chief problem is to make running expenses, interest on the investment and a little surplus. The maintenance of the fertility must wait until the farmer has found that he can make a living on the land, unless he can maintain the fertility and receive pay for so doing immediately in increased yields. The main problem in western Nebraska at the present time is the storage and use of water unless it be the marketing of the products of the soil. I mean, whether they shall be marketed via the elevator or via live stock. The storage of moisture is closely con- </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ited with the problem of fertility in this section of the country, e supply of nitrogen is in direct proportion to the supply of humus, e waterholding capacity of the soil and the physical condition the soil bear a close relation to the amount of humus in the soil, e addition of humus increases the water holding capacity of a i. Humus also tends to make the soil more porous and spongy, 1 keeps it from running together and puddling, and also from ng blown easily by the wind. As the humic content is increased physical and chemical condition of the soil is improved. I Two methods of tillage, that may be regarded as peculiar to land farming, are summer tillage and surface cultivation. These uire the keeping of a mulch of dry soil on the surface of the fields. a provides the best possible conditions for the burning up of nus and the escape of nitrogen. Keeping a field tilled all season ?s the best conditions for organisms to break down humus and liberate nitrogen. It must be admitted that the most approved :hods of tillage tend to deplete the nitrogen in the soil faster n the old methods of tillage. On the other hand it is possible t, for the amount of crop produced, the new methods are more nomical in the use of nitrogen than the old. _ . I There is only one way to increase the fertility of this s«H. tat way is to put something into the soil, the element or constitu - t that the soil requires. Even, if commercial fertilizers were cheap, ;y alone would not serve the purpose, as the soil requires humus well as nitrogen. The only practical way to increase the fertility to put back into the soil a part of the product of the soil. This ly be done by plowing under a green manure crop or by growing crop, the roots of which will fertilize the soil, or by putting barn - rd or other manure on the soil. The green manure crops that might be considered are of two kinds, leguminous and non-leguminous. Of the former kind, about the only annual plant available is peas, and of the latter kind, probably rye. is the most suitable. The leguminous crop should add more fertility than the non-leguminous as it contains more nitrogen, and also since the bacteria on its roots collect nitrogen from the air. Under present conditions it is not practical to plow under either of these crops. Peas do not usually mature seed when sown in the field. The seed must be bought at a cost of about $4.00 per acre. The use of the land one year' and the labor of seeding and plowing under the crop will make the cost of this green manure crop $6.00 or $8.00 per acre, or about one-third or one-fourth the present price of the land. Rye will not cost so much, but in a country where profitable crops do not come every season, it would require strong proof of benefit to be derived in order to induce a farmer to run under a crop of rye, with the hope of thereby increasing the yield at some future time. Rather than pursue either of these methods, it would seem more profitable to spend the money in buying more acres. By doing so one would be purchasing fertility much more cheaply than by turning under either of these green manure crops. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 287 The only crops that might be expected to add fertility, when grown on the soil and the forage hauled off, are alfalfa and brome grass. We believe that these are likely to fail when put to this test. Alfalfa has not been grown profitably on the table-land unless it were planted in rows, or on land receiving more water than the average precipitation of the region. It has not yet been demon - strated that alfalfa can be grown in rows profitably on the table - lands in western Nebraska by the average farmer. Brome grass has not been grown profitably under average conditions. Some people will contend that neither of these crops, if hau.ed off the land, will increase the fertility of the soil. I do not have data at hand to prove or disprove this point. However, all the growth is never taken off a field of alfalfa or brome grass, in actual practice. Also, the soil must be able to produce vegetation with which to supply itself with humus under natural conditions, as otherwise it would never have accumulated humus. However, if the amount of humus and nitrogen in the soil on the table-land is not increased excepting as alfalfa and brome grass are grown, the very large per - centage of the acres are as rich now as they are likely ever to be. By feeding all the produce of the soil on the farm and returning the waste product to the soil in the best possible condition, a great deal can be accomplished toward maintaining the fertility of the soil. This means selling but little or no grain at the elevator, and keeping enough live stock to eat all the forage and grain that the farm produces. It means tilling less land and keeping more live stock. It means burning no straw stacks, corn stalks or stubble. The corn stalks should be put in the silo or through a shredder or thresher into a stack. The straw should be fed to the stock or used for bedding. All the manure thus made should be taken to the land as soon as it is made and scattered thinly. Where straw cannot be used for bedding, farmers have secured beneficial results by scattering it thinly over wheat fields during the fall and winter. Judging by the evidence available at the present time, it would seem that a profitable system of farming in western Nebraska will be a system that will market the products of the soil through live stock. Even if grain farming alone were profitable, it would fail in the end because of the depletion of the fertility. This has been true of all the land farmed to small grain in the United States, and would be true here if grain farming »e'e carried on for two or three generations. Grain farming alone cannot be the permanent practice of any community having conditions similar to those in western Nebraska. The history of the country does not lend much encouragement to the practice of grain farming alone. I have been in western Nebraska more than a quarter of a century, and have never known a man to make money growing small grain if he stayed at it for many years. What he gained during good years he lost during bad years. It may be that with modern machinery, improved seed and </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE up-to-date methods of tillage, one can succeed by growing grain, but success has not been gained in the past by this practice. The men who have succeeded are those who gave considerable attention to live stock. The small farmer, who made his hens lay eggs and his cows produce cream and butter, has made the most money on the capital invested. The larger farmer, who grew hogs, cattle and horses and farmed sufficient land to grow grain and forage for his live stock, has frequently gained considerable wealth. He has not paid much attention to maintaining the fertility of the soil, but the practice of feeding the product of the soil on the farm gives assurance that the fertility of the soil has not been greatly depleted. The men who go on western Nebraska farms, as elsewhere, may be divided into three classes. First, those who would make only a fair living under the most favorable conditions. Their wants are not so insistant as their worthlessness. These people are quite certain of making a living, or at least of continuing to exist. Second, those who expect to become well fixed in a few years. These are in the majority. They farm on a larger scale or keep more stock each year, if they are accumulating capital. If they go broke they try again. Some of this class succeed and some fail as in all lines of business and in all localities. The third class are those who are satisfied with making a good living, rearing and educating their children, and accumulating a little more wealth as the years go by. They do not expect, probably do not wish, to become rich. It is the people of this class who make but few failures in any line of work. They conduct their business on a safe basis. Farmers of this kind are the ones who have succeeded in western Nebraska. They do not till many acres but they get the greatest value possible from the forage or grain produced from the soil. The grocer gets no cash from these people. They trade eggs and butter for groceries and clothing. A load of hogs and a few cattle go to market oc - casionally. A good horse or mule is sold when not needed on the farm. There is no large outlay for machinery or for hired help. This so.t of a farmer, when once established, cannot be driven out by drouth or by the money lender. His hens and cows know no drouth and keep the balance in his favor at the grocery store. When the western Nebraska farmer becomes content to farm in this manner he will succeed, but the man who gambles for big, quick returns, is taking big risks. The small farmer marketing the product of the soil as live stock or live stock products will have but little diffi - culty in maintaining the fertility of the soil. I have not given any scientific data to assist in the solution of this problem. So far as I know few facts especially applicable to western Nebraska are at hand. We have experiments under way, which should give much valuable information when they have been conducted a sufficient length of time. So far the results of these experiments do not indicate anything definite. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">289 We are trying rye and peas as green manure crops in three - year and four-year rotations with spring grains and corn and with winter wheat. Rotations in which the crop is alfalfa three years out of six, and also rotations in which the crop is brome grass three years out of six, are being compared with various other rotations. Manure is being tried in many rotations. One plat is being summer tilled continuously year after year to determine what the effect will be on the humus and nitrogen. Another plat is being green manured each year. The soil is analyzed at certain times and exact records kept. It may be a profitable practice to permit a field to lie idle and grow weeds a few years in order that it may increase in humus and nitrogen. This is not an unknown practice in the sand hills where farming has been carried on for twenty-five or more years. We hope that when the problem of fertility has become as important in western Nebraska as it is now in eastern Nebraska, the results from these rotations will show some practical method of maintaining the fertility of the soil in western Nebraska. HOW TO CULTIVATE CORN By Chat. Y. Thompson After all that has been said and written about how to cultivate corn, it might appear presumptous for me, a common farmer, to attempt to enlighten you further on the subject. But I have no new or startling theories to advance; all I expect to do is to fulfill my promise to tell you what I think I know about cultivating corn, in the hope that I may be able to drop a helpful hint or if nothing more, to start the proverbial hare. It is a proverb that "The little dog starts the hare and the big dog catches him." In this instance, I am the little dog. My subject is the hare, and the gentlemen to follow are the big dogs. I'll start the hare, but if the big dogs don't catch him they are to blame, not I. I can tell you in just a few words how I cultivate corn. I cultivate about four inches deep the first and second time, and not quite so deep the third time. Of course, the culture of corn will vary with the conditions of soil and climate. So in giving my reasons for cultivating corn as I do, I am taking into consideration only such conditions as prevail in northeastern Nebraska, where my experience as a corn grower has been confined. Taking it for granted that a proper seed bed has been prepared, and the corn planted and harrowed several times, the next important operation is cultivating. That brings up the question, " Why do we cultivate?" To which I would answer — to kill weeds, to aerate and warm the soil and to conserve the moisture. In view of the fact 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p290">290 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE that weeds deplete the land of moisture and plant food more than the crop does, it behooves us to put forth our best efforts to do a good job of cultivating the first time; because the weeds at this time are small and easily covered and have taken practically no fertility or moisture from the soil. Cultivate deep and close to the corn the first time. We are generally favored with an abundance of moisture in the spring; the ground has been harrowed several times before and after planting, and becomes cold and packed, making it anything but congenial for the tender corn plant. There are no roots to prune at this time, so it is good practice to cultivate as close to the corn as possible, thus making it easier to cover the weeds between the rows. Allow the shovels to go into the ground quite deep; because if not deeply stirred the soil will soon repack and we have the same uncongenial conditions that we nad before cultivating. In the language of the soil expert, "cultivation hastens those physical and chemical changes which are necessary to render the plant food in the soil available for use by the growing crops. Stirring and pulverizing the land changes the mineral elements like potassium, calcium, and phosphorus from the insoluble to more soluble and available forms. The air admitted into the soil renders the inactive nitrogen available as nitrates. Decaying or organic matter is also necessary to promote feitility, but its effect is greatly increased by good cultivation. Each particle of soil is brought in contact with a particle of fertilizing material and enriched thereby." This may be only theory; I don't know; but result; in practice seem to bear ample testimony of its plausibility. Certainly every farmer has observed how fast the co*n g ows after the first cultiva - tion. There is a reason. The second cultivation is performed in about the same manner as the first, except that the beams are placed a little farther apart in order to avoid root pruning. At the Minnesota Experiment Station it was found that the corn toots had penetrated tne soil twelve inches deep and had spread laterally eighteen inches eighteen days after it was planted; thus it will be seen that unless one is careful, much damage can be done at this time. The third cultivation. If the seed bed was properly prepared and the work before and immediately after planting was done in an efficient manner, the first and second cultivation will practically eliminate the weed problem, and the third cultivation is given principally to form a mulch that will conserve moisture and make the soil more receptive of rains. It is the custom with most farmers to cultivate their corn three times and then leave it to the care of Providence. Whether this is a good or bad custom depends largely upon the character of the soil and the season, and also whether or not one can find time to give this extra cultivation without conflicting with other farm work which may be of more importance. I ani of the opinion that too </seg>
            <seg id="p291">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 291 much cultivation does not pay, but many times the conditions are such that a fourth and even a fifth cultivation will pay well in increased yields. I am aware, that this view is not in accordance with the results of experiments recorded in bulletin No. 257 recently issued by the government. Time will not permit the discussion of this bulletin in detail, but the summary is quoted as follows — "A number of tests made at several agricultural experiment stations seem to indi - cate that it is the weed factor that makes the cultivation of corn necessary; or state the proposition conversely, that cultivation is not beneficial to the corn plant except in so far as removing the weeds is concrened. The subject of weed control is recognized as a fundamental one in tillage philosophy. It was therefore determined to carry on, over a wide range of climatic and soil conditions, a large number of tests of the relative yields of corn produced by supposedly optimum cultivation as compared with mere weed elimina - tion. The experiments were made by having two plats or sets of plats, one of which received no cultivation after planting, the weeds being kept down by a horizontal stroke of a sharp hoe at the surfac of the soil, particular care being taken not to disturb the soil or to form a soil mulch; the other set of plats received the usual cultiva tion. This work was carried on by the Department of Agricultur for six years (1906 to 1911) in co-operation with several state agri cultural experiment stations and with farmers, many of whom wer graduates of agricultural colleges. The results of 125 experiment are recorded in this bulletin, including the early experiment-station tests. The seven years' work in Utah is given separate discussion Of the 125 experiments 124 record grain yields and fifty-five fodde yields. "A general . average of all these experiments shows that the weeded plats produced 95.1 per cent as much fodder and 99.108 per cent as much grain as the cultivated ones. If there was any difference between either set of plats in regard to thoroughness in keeping down weeds it was in favor of the cultivated plats. "Although it remains to be demonstrated how far this principle may be applied in any particular section, as a general average for all the regions in which this work was done, it may be concluded that the proposition just stated rs substantially true. If this be accepted, weed control becomes the principal object of cultivation. Weeds may be attacked in two ways: (1) By the use of tillage im - plements, the primary purpose of which is their eradication, and (2) by adopting cropping systems having that object in view. The results obtained are interpreted as follows — "The reasons why un - cultivated land kept free from weeds should yield practically as much corn (grain) per acre as that given the most approved modern cul - tivation are not clear. The results, however, point strongly to the conclusion that the principal object of cultivation is the destruction of weeds. Where the weeds are kept down by some other method </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cultivation seems to be of no particular advantage. This is contrary to the accepted teaching on this point, and the conclusion is stated only tentatively. There have been abundant experimental results to show that when land is fallow a soil mulch upon it tends to pre - serve the moisture in the soil. "It appears quite possible that when the soil is fully occupied by the roots of a growing crop there is little possibility of moisture from the deeper layers of the soil being drawn by capillary action to the surface, where it could be evaporated, for in doing so the moisture would have to thread its way through a maze of roots eager to absorb it. Does it not seem that these roots would them - selves play the part that a soil mulch would play if the roots were not there? If such is the case, what additional advantage would arise by having a mulch on a surface beneath which is a tangle of fine roots capable of absorbing any moisture that might try to pass upward to the surface? "On the other hand, these roots would not interfere to any great extent with the progress of rain water downward in the soil, for when rainfall is great enough to saturate the surface soil there would be more moisture present than the roots could absorb. Thus, while the soil mulch is important on fallow soils as a means of holding moisture, is it not possible that a soil well filled with living plant roots is not in need of a mulch for this purpose? This would at least be a plausible explanation of the results reported in this bulletin. " It is further suggested that these results may partly be due to the fact that tillage mutilates the surface roots of the crop. Again, a fall of rain too light to moisten the soil below the depth of stirring would all be lost on the cultivated land because it would not reach the roots of the crop, while on the weeded plat there would be enough roots in the surface soil to absorb a considerable portion of such light rainfall before it had time to evaporate. While the suggestion that the presence of a maze of living roots in the soil would itself, to a large extent, prevent loss of moisture by evaporation at the surface, it is not proved that this is the case. We must therefore consider other possibilities. Even with ordinary methods of cultiva - tion there would be some loss of moisture at the surface, for tillage itself would expose a large amount of moist soil to the atmosphere, so that in any case a growing crop would hardly utilize all the rain - fall that occurs during the growing season. If however, the loss of moisture by evaporation is greater on the uncultivated plats than on the cultivated ones, it is possible that this would be compensated for by a correspondingly greater amount of nitrates and other soluble salts being brought up from the deeper layers of the soil to the sur - face, thus furnishing a greater quantity of plant food for the corn roots. It should be clearly understood that the writers offer these remarks as suggestions. The underlying causes for the phenomena observed must be left for future determination." </seg>
            <seg id="p293">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 293 With such an abundance of evidence to support the contention that weed control is a fundamental one in tillage philosophy it would seem that the proposition is tenable. But since most of these experiments were conducted east of the Mississippi and but few west of the Missouri river, it might be seriously questioned whether the same results would be obtained here. In support of my contention that cultivation is a benefit to corn aside from the fact that it destroys weeds, I can do no better than to cite my experience in 1901, which was an exceptionally dry year. One of' my neighbors, whose corn field adjoined mine, cul - tivated his corn three times "laying it by" with a disk cultivator, which left a narrow ridge of uncultivated ground between the rows. There were no roots pruned here and the field was free from weeds, but as the season advanced and the soil became dry, large cracks began to form along this uncultivated ridge between the rows. Some of them became so large that the hand could be easily inserted. What was the result? As the ground dried it hardened about the rootlets, which were imbedded in it, and naturally they were rup - tured, with the result that the corn fired up to the ears some time in August. My corn was cultivated immediately after the planter, with a six shovel cultivator. It was then harrowed smooth and cul - tivated three times more with the same cultivator. About the time the ears began to shoot and the corn began to draw heavily on the soil for moisture, small cracks began to form and I got busy with my one horse cultivator. This cultivator had a wheel in front and and an adjustment behind, so that it could be regulated to cultivate any depth. I simply leveled the ridges made by the last cultivation. This field of corn remained green until the frost killed it and yielded fifty bushels to the acre, while many fields close by yielded less than half as much. It is not impossible that some other factor unknown to me, entered in to make this wonderful showing; but I have always thought that it was this extra cultivation and believe so still. I am not opinionated, however, and hope that this point may be cleared up in the discussion of this paper. Quoting further from this same bulletin- -"Another large field of investigation in connection with weed control is of much practical importance to the farmer. This field of work might be outlined as a study of those systems of farming or rotations which are especially calculated to lessen the weed pests on the farm. It is a well known fact that certain rotations of crops bring us round to the tillage crop with the land practically free from weeds. One experiment is reported where a piece of sod land very free from anything but clover and timothy was put to corn and no cultivation given, as no weeds were present; a crop of seventy bushels per acre was produced." On the other hand, I can cite an instance where a plethora of weeds was the salvation of a field of corn. In 1903 I think it was, </seg>
            <seg id="p294">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 294 one of our renters had a field of corn which on account of incessant rain, was cultivated but once, and that was when the corn was small. The weeds grew rank, almost as high as the corn, making a jungle of weeds and corn that was almost impenetrable at husking time. This corn yielded close to fifty bushels per acre. Thus it will be seen that with conditions as far apart as the antipodes, we have results about equally favorable. Here is food for thought. Let us analyze it and see what we can find that is wholesome. Why do we cultivate? First, to kill weeds. But sod ground as a rule is practically free from weeds. Second, to aerate and warm the soil. The deep growing roots of clover leave air passages in the soil, making free circulation of air possible. Third, to conserve moisture. It is generally conceded that the capillary retentive power for water is far greater in soils containing an abundance of humus, than it is in that of the ordinary clay soil. Humus also increases the tem - perature and prevents the soil from cracking. Is it not a fact then that we have in the clover sod that very condition without cultiva - tion, that we have in the ordinary clay soil after cultivation? But how are we going to account for the large yield of corn which had but one cultivation, the weeds being as high as the corn? In the first place, this was rich bottom land and it had fertility to spare. Moisture was superfluous, but the weeds utilized this superfluous moisture and prevented the soil from becoming water-logged. Thus securing to the soil a more rapid change of air, which seemed to be the only remaining essential for the proper growth of the corn plant. In conclusion, I will say it depends entirely upon conditions whether cultivation is beneficial or not. Conditions in agriculture vary, but the principles underlying it are always the same. It is possible that many times we put in long, dreary days in the scorching sun, when our time might be more profitably spent sitting in the cool shade studying some good book on soil physics, or how plants grow. It is to be hoped that we may not be compelled to continue long in our blissful ignorance. Let our Nebraska experimenters bestir themselves a bit and make investigations along this line. In the meantime, let us continue to cultivate our corn in the same old way, ever keeping in touch with the work at the experiment station, for it is well to " Never be the first the new to try, nor yet the last the old to lay aside." CARE IN HANDLING SEED By W. F. Johnson Mr. Chairman: This subject to my mind is one of the most important ones to come before this body, and, for that matter should be always present in the minds of everyone who makes a business of producing, handling or using any and all kinds of seed, whether for his own use or for the market. </seg>
            <seg id="p295">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 295 I Too many people are in the habit of handling or selling the ious seeds for the one object only — for what they can make out them, not from the productive or scientific standpoint, but for &gt; purpose of gain in dollars. If this be the prime object of this Dciation it should, and will fall of its own weight. Therefore, subject — the care of the seed — is of vital importance to the suc - i of this association. I cannot be too specific, for the members this association are supposed to produce all kinds of seeds to be d on the farm. But I wish to impress on each and everyone of you the neces - sity of more, in fact, every little detail of care and the utmost pre - caution to prevent the mixing and the adulteration of the various seeds. We cannot be too careful in planning and planting our peed plots, for during the period of pollination and fertilization, we have many varying problems to contend with, such as the close proximity of the different plots or fields, the wind, the birds and the many insects that carry the pollen during the fertilizing period and at the harvest time, especially with the small grains and grasses. I It is important that someone make it their business to see that : grains are not mixed through the machine handling them and elessness of the help. At threshing time, see that the machine well cleaned before your seed is passed through it. This is one the most common modes of mixing grains. The bins should be an, shallow and well ventilated. Too much stress cannot be placed this part of the question, for without its full power of germina - n, seeds of any kind are of questionable value. tit should be the pride of every member of this association to ;e upon the market nothing but absolutely pure, clean seeds. m though the inspector has visited and carefully inspected every I just before the harvest, it is not probable that all the seed will fit to market or plant, until it has been thoroughly cleaned and led; and to my mind, this cannot be done too carefully. In my i experience of buying some seed supposed to be pure, I got one I seeded to chickory that has cost me many times the price of d seed besides losing the use of the land and failure to procure jfficient stand of Bromus grass. We should have a law providing seed inspectors, with authority to prosecute and punish anyone ing foul, impure or adulterated seeds — laws the same or similar to pure food law provisions. (If you will only stop to think about it, you will recall that it been almost impossible to get good, pure seed of most any kind, the sooner something is done to permit only good, pure, true - ame seed to be sold in Nebraska the better for all parties con - led. As, only good seeds can produce good paying crops, and as iraska is purely an agricultural state and our prosperity depends n the success of its agriculturists, it is of great importance that have a law compelling the purity of the seeds produced and within its borders. </seg>
            <seg id="p296">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 296 I In the corn, I think we aie only in our infancy so far as what know of the possibilities of the corn plant and what we may elop. This seed plot needs more room than any other grain with ch I am familiar. There are so many possibilities whereby it y become mixed, and one must be ever watchful to keep it true type. The seed should be gathered as soon as it becomes mi - ;d, before a heavy frost if possible, and always from the field &gt;re the regular gathering time so as to select individuality. There are many good ways to handle and dry the ears and each one will be compelled to be governed by the amount of seed and the capacity of the buildings to care for it. Last October while on a trip through Iowa and Illinois I saw many wind mill towers and south porches literally covered with fine ears of corn. After a few days in the sun and wind this corn was stored in a sheltered place and more took its place in the open. Of course the possibility of rain on that on the tower was always to be contended with. An - other good way is to have racks made to hold one or two ears in a place, so as to permit a circulation of air all around each ear. Over - head between double corn crib3 is a convenient way to utilize the otherwise wasted roof space. I have seen racks made in many shapes, such as trees, wall brackets, etc., mad? of large wire so each ear can be stuck on it separately. There are many other good ways you may adopt according to your local conditions. The important things to remember are to dry it well before a freeze and to keep it in a dry well ventilated place. Do not pile it where it can heat at any time, and do not shell it until ready for planting. There some artificial drying plants in operation I am told that are doing good work. In the absence of any personal knowledge, I will not comment on them. Klf you are shipping seed of any kind, the package or container of great importance. The first impression a customer receives, [ally remains with him and often has much to do with the manner his handling, and care of the planting, and the interest he may elop during the growing period. tThe motto of every seed producer whether he be a member of Nebraska Pure Grain and Seed Growers' Association or not, uld be the golden rule, and always produce and place on the ■ket nothing but pure, thrifty, unadulterated grain or seeds of itever kind they may be. The future of this association depends the honesty and integrity of its members. </seg>
            <seg id="p297">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 297 tRKETING OF FARM PRODUCE FOR GREATEST PROFIT UNDER PRESENT MARKET SYSTEMS By George O. Virtue (Read before the Nebraska Corn Improvers' Association). Jan - uary 20, 1913. It is a good sign that during the past few years farmers' organ izations, after a period during which stress has been laid on the pro - ductive side of their business, have renewed the attack so fiercely made in the era of falling prices during the '70's and '80's upon the problem of getting the most possible out of the crop produced There has for a long time been a sort of acquiescence in the view that the marketing of the standardized crops, i. e., those sold ac cording to an established grade, would take care of itself. It has been assumed that competition among buyers would assure a fai price in a given market; and that competition of buyers in differen primary markets would develop the most efficient organization fo the handling of farm products. If, for example, by inefficiency collusion of dealers, or otherwise, at Kansas City the handling o grain were made unduly expensive, through heavy switching o elevator charges, high commissions, dishonest grading, or the placing of artificial obstructions between producer and consumer, it has been held openly by some, tacitly by others, that grain would quickly shift its course to those markets where more favorable conditions pre - vail. And so it is held with some show of reasonableness that "the competition of primary markets for the same grain generally tends to keep up the level of prices to the producer," and to develop the most efficient organization for handling the product. With the growing size and complexity of commercial organisa - tion during the past dozen years, with recognized existing solidarity of interests in the great exchanges of the country, with the well known practices in the terminal markets, designed to maintain "regularity" in the marketing of produce, faith in the conclusions outlined above has been much shaken as far as the grain market is concerned. The conditions affecting the marketing of livestock are still more open to suspicion, because wherever you take your cattle and hogs for sale you are met by the same set of buyers, the big packers, who exercise a dominant influence in all slaughtering centers. How far there is collusion among the packers and the large dealers in grain in "fixing prices," how far they suppress competition to the injury of the seller, is largely a matter of surmise. Here lies a vast field for careful, painstaking investigation. The interests at stake are too important to be allowed to rest on assumptions. The census value of the cereal crops of the country for 1909 was $2,665,000,000, 11,438,000,000 of which represented the corn crop and $657,000,000 the wheat crop. Something like two-thirds of the grain crop enters directly into the channels of trade. In 1911 there were received at </seg>
            <seg id="p298">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 298 the twelve most important primary markets for livestock 50,000,000 head of cattle, hogs and sheep. These are only the big items in the market account of American farms. They represent an interest too great for producer and consumer to be turned over to the distributers without serious inquiry as to the efficiency and integrity of the vast organization which has grown up between producer and consumer. Very possibly, the most important part of the subject assigned to me lies in the reform of the commercial organization at the primary markets. But without careful study of the specific problems involved it seems worse than folly to suggest remedies for evils that after all might turn out to be more apparent than real. One way of testing the efficiency of an organization is to subject it to a competi - tion with an opposing system; and I may in leaving this phase of the subject express the hope that Mr. Dornblaser in his paper will touch upon the possibilities of carrying the principle of co-operation into the great markets, thus bringing the producer face to face with the consumer, and, incidentally, testing the efficiency of the present organization of the markets. tMy task is to suggest possible ways of marketing to better antage under the present system. Four possibilities in this ction may be suggested: 1. By reducing the cost of transportation. In the days of anti-railroad agitation this was a favorite mode of relief to the farmer, and for many it has not yet lost its attractiveness. There seems little prospect, however, of any considerable reduction in the near future of railway rates. During the last ten years the average freight earnings per ton-mile have remained pretty constantly about three-fourths of a cent for the whole country. The Chicago-New York grain rates have likewise changed but slightly. The average per bushel of corn for five years 1901-1905 was 9.89 cents, for the five years 1906-1911, 9.42 cents. For wheat per bushel for the two periods the rate was 10.56 cents and 10.09 cents respectively. The livestock rates between these two points have remained unchanged for ten years and there has been a slight advance on dressed beef. We can hardly look for marked reductions of railroad charges unless they should be forced by waterway improvements now under way or projected. It seems that the greatest possibility of reducing the transporta - tion cost of marketing lies in the farmer's own hands. An investiga - tion made by Frank Andrews for the Department of Agriculture in 1907, shows that it costs on the average about twenty cents per ton - mfle for moving wheat from the farm to the shipping point; and for moving corn, about fourteen cents per ton-mile. The cost for Nebraska was about the average. He shows that the^cost of moving wheat to shipping points was 7.2 per cent of the value of the wheat; for moving corn, 9.6 per cent; and for moving all products con - sidered, 5.2 per cent. It costs nearly half as much (nine cents) to carry 100 pounds of wheat over the average country-road haul </seg>
            <seg id="p299">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 299 (9.4 mi.) as it does to carry 100 pounds from Chicago to Liver - pool. Here is a tremendous initial expense in marketing and here lies a possibility, through improvements in reaching the market town, through the use of larger wagons, heavier teams, and above all, through the improvement of country roads to bring the farm nearer to market and to realize better prices for farm products. 2. My second suggestion has to do with the form in which farm products are marketed. There has been much talk recently about promoting manufactures in Nebraska. The most natural growth in this direction lies in the conversion of corn and forage crops into beef, pork and dairy products. The Department of Agriculture estimates that 30 per cent of the 1911 corn crop in Nebraska was shipped out of the county of growth. One could easily believe the percentage was far higher, but that given is large enough to show what can be done. Illinois farmers next door to their market may afford to sell their products in crude form. The Ne - braska farmer is concerned to market his product in the most valu - able form possible. The census figures show that between 1900 and 1910 the number of cattle, of swine and of sheep on Nebraska farms actually declined. There was an increase in the number of draft animals, and what is more gratifying, in the number of dairy cows. But it is still a matter of complaint that the reasons for the slight growth of co-operative dairying in the state is the deficiency of milk cows required to supply local dairies. And so it has come about that the most significant thing in the dairy business in this state is the centralized control of that industry by a few strong concerns. The extension of dairying and stock raising is not merely one of maintaining the fertility of our fields, important as that is, but is essentially one of marketing grain and forage crops to the best advantage. Not every farmer is cut out for a dairyman, or feeder, especially of $9 or $10 cattle; but for the man who can steer clear of the reefs in this era of high prices there is waiting a reward of higher prices for what he raises. It will not be going too far afield to poiYit out in this connection that the utilization of feed in its most efficient form is a mode of marketing for highest profit. A single illustration of this point must suffice. The economy of ensilage has been demonstrated over and over again, and yet only a small fraction of farmers make use of this economy. A recent test made at the Iowa Experiment Station shows the superiority of a corn-silage ration for wintering ewes. It shows that the difference between the cheapest ration without silage and the most expensive silage combination was a saving of 18.1 per cent; and between the most expensive non-silage ration and the least expensive silage combination was a saving of 40 per cent. Here is a market question of prime importance. A farmer might as well sell his product to a middleman 40 per cent under the market as to throw it away on the ewes in that proportion. On </seg>
            <seg id="p300">300 imj^ j fca K I J J pi C T?\ f j H *^ j%^ 1\ A 3^ A ■ Cj H^ *f\ t\ \ * V^f f^ n T B^ In * n F *^T T Jt JC the whole the middleman would make a better social use of the gift than the ewes possibly could. 3. While recognizing the necessity of maintaining an organisa - tion of middlemen for disposing of farm products, I yet believe there are many ways of dispensing with their services and saving their profits. Some of the farmers' elevator companies make a point of selling direct to millers to the advantage of both parties. There seems no reason why this practice should not be extended. The movement for the establishment of city markets has some promise of higher prices, especially for the small farmer. The high cost of living has raised the question of restoring the public market as a place where consumer and producer may meet; and for some locali - ties better markets could thus be secured for certain farm products than to allow them to pass through the middleman's hands. Another possibility of direct trade has been opened by the long delayed establishment of the parcels post. Already in many localities farmers are dealing directly with the consumers of their butter, eggs, and other products. This direct trade means not only cheaper trading, but higher prices because of the freshness and high standard of the product furnished. ti. My last point has to do with the time of marketing, and i it I have reached no very satisfactory conclusion. The question recently been brought before the farmers of the country in a i way by the National Congress held at New Orleans in Novem- The Congress appointed a committee to inquire into the blem of warehousing all agricultural products and issuing nego - e instruments thereon." Every farmer is faced constantly with problem here suggested as to when to sell to best advantage, her to become his own warehouseman; or, to call attention to her phase of the matter, as to whether he shall become a specu - in his own products. I shall confine my inquiry to the sale of the two cereals in which Nebraska has the most vital interest, corn and wheat. Does it pay better to sell grain a't harvest time or to hold it for a rise in price? This can not be answered in advance with respect to any particular year. Holding grain off the market may be looked upon as a speculative venture. The real question then is this: Is the farmer on the whole in a better or worse position for taking this speculative risk than those who make the taking of such risks a business? On theoretical grounds one would say that the class of speculators who make the buying of grain for a profit their business, who base their operations upon every scrap of available information as to probable future market conditions, are in a better position to take the risk than the farmer. One could also say, on theoretical grounds, in view of the world-wide competition among buyers for these crops, that the prices offered at harvest are as high as is con - sistent with probable future prices and the costs of carrying the grain till sold to consumers. These costs, aside from transportation </seg>
            <seg id="p301">301 and commission charges which must be paid regardless of the time of sale, are storage, insurance, interest, waste and shrinkage. I have gone over such statistics as were available in order to determine if possible whether, on the average, the facts coincide with these theoretical conclusions. • The first fact to be noted is the very large proportion of the wheat and the corn crops that are thrown upon the market during the months immediately following the harvest. The heavy marketing months for wheat are July, August, September and October. Fifty - nine per cent of the wheat crop of 1911 that left the farm was sold in these four months. In recent years the average amount marketed during these months has been somewhat over 55 per cent. Likewise about half the corn sold off the farms goes to market during No - vember, December, January and February. One would expect the piling up of the visible supply which takes place regularly during these months to have a depressing effect upon prices. And yet so eager is the bidding to get control of the supply, to such an extent is the "future discounted," it seems doubtful whether there is much profit in the speculative holding of the two cereals, wheat and corn. I have prepared some tables, indicating, not with scientific accuracy, but by a system of crude averages, what the price exper - ience has been during the eleven years, 1900-1910 inclusive. There is no way of ascertaining exact average prices. My statistics are compiled from the publications of the Department of Agriculture and the reports of the Chicago Board of Trade. These publications give the "range" of prices, "the high and low, for each month, but there ts no way of ascertaining the true average price. The average of the high and the low, however, gives a crude indication of market conditions except when there was some extraordinary fluctuation due to an attempt to corner, or the like disturbance. tThe table of wheat prices shows the "average" of high and low September, the heaviest marketing month, the "average" for imber and for May following, and the amount by which Decem - and May prices were higher or lower than September. </seg>

May increases ranged i 4.1 cents to 24.7 cents; the decreases from 1.4 cents to 18.4. three of these years the decrease from September prices was ve cents or more. Without going into the question of shrinkage, storage and waste, the conclusion seems safe that it is better for the farmer to sell his wheat at harvest than in December or on the eve of the next harvest.

Probably if we I true average prices the difference would be shown to be greater, order to test these results by another set of returns, given out by Department of Agriculture, comparison has been made with "farm price" of corn on December 1, and on May 1 following, the last five years. The difference shown between the December May average for these years is 8.9 cents, as compared with ifference of 5.8 cents shown by the average of high and low prices Chicago. »lf we take the Chicago prices as a basis of computation the •stion resolves to this: Does it pay the farmer on the average hold his crop from Decembec to May for this rise of 5.8 cents bushel? This can not be answered without considering the costs carrying the corn. (One of these costs is shrinkage. Careful shrinkage experiment* e been made at several of the Agricultural Experiment Stations, ably at those in Illinois, Iowa and Kansas. The Kansas tests wed an average loss from husking time to June, of 6.8 per cent; Illinois the average was 14.4 per cent to the end of May; in 'a, to the end of June, 16.2 per cent. § Taking the Illinois shrinkage figures, as representing average ditions, the farmer who markets his corn in May has only about per cent as much to market as he had in the fall, and his price Irop ol or Lower ( — ) thanDecember December May 37.8 65.0 50.5 42.3 46.2 46.1 43.0 59.5 59.5 64.2 47.7 60.5 61.9 45.0 48.6 56.2 48.2 52.7 74.8 74.2 59.5 53.7 ±11 — 5.6 + 6.3 + 10.0 + 2.1 1,2:1 The table shows that in eight of the eleven y iverage excess in these pi ?xcess was ten cents or n cents.

Applying the form- Price before shrinkage is to price after shrinkage as Weight after shrinkage is to weight before shrinkage, ifind that the average excess of the May price pver the December e for the period covered by the table was not sufficient to make for the shrinkage. When corn is worth fifty-one cents in Decem - the May price ought to be sixty cents to cover the shrinkage id by the Illinois Experiment Station, whereas it was only 56.8 ts. This is enough to cover the shrinkage loss as shown by the isas Experiment with two cents to spare.

If we take into account cost of storage, insurance, and interest, and the fact that under rage storage conditions on the farm there are wastes other than shrinkage shown by the experiment station tests, the inducement hold back the crop grows less. For example the interest on a f cent bushel of corn at 6 per cent for six months is 1.5 cents, . the spring price must be high enough to cover that item as I as the shrink. kWe have dealt all the way through with "averages," and not satisfactory ones at that.

It is from successful estimates of this kind that profits arise; and it is from such estimates that the farmer must decide in any given year whether it will pay to market his crop as soon as convenient after harvest or enter the field of specula - tion. He has thus far in the game been at a great disadvantage with the professional speculator and he probably always will be; but the handicap on the farmer is in part being removed by the development of government statistical bureaus which give to all the results of their investigations of world crops and markets. Every •tep taken in this direction, whether by government, or by such organizations as the International Institute of Agriculture, since it tends to break down the monopoly of infoimation about market conditions, places the farmer in a better position to judge for himself when he should sell. But after all such information shall have become available to the farmer it will still remain a question whether he can successfully compete with the professional speculators in retaining control of the grain supply. There seems to be a better prospect for gains through producing the expense of those devious processes controlled by the middlemen, a subject, be it again said, worthy of careful investiga - tion. Such reductions it may be found necessary to make by legal regulation; but I should prefer to see them brought about by the silent force of competition with a more economical organization of the grain trade; and I should like to see that organization in the hands of the men who harvest the crops, to-operating among them - selves and with consumers similarly organized to reduce the enorm - ous cost of getting the food supply from the farm to the consumers' pantry. MAINTAINING A SPECIAL SEED PLOT By F. A. Swimon There is a growing demand for the pure, unadulterated seed with vitality selected and bred for a more satisfactory yield. A COMMON SYSTEM The distributing of seeds in times past has largely been monopolized by the seed catalogue houses, attaching gilt-edged names, with elaborate descriptions of the wonderful productive powers. I got half a bushel fifteen years ago with a record of 312 per acre. Had it two years and gave it up. The fact of the matter is that these concerns don't grow or improve corn. They are handlers. The more handling, the more profit. Seeds of some variety are sold to a farmer under contract to buy the whole crop at about 10 per cent above market price, but more often the seed is bought by the crib. Last winter while </seg>
            <seg id="p307">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 307 Ing on the train not far north of here I saw a great rush of farmers oping their ear corn into cars on the track for seed purposes, be shipped off to the seed companies of this state. Sixty thousand bushels of corn was bought around that little town for that purpose. At another town not two stations farther east cribs upon cribs were procured and this, mind you, was to be shipped shelled, the seed buyer claiming it to test 90 per cent. tcan imagine what the corn grower who buys this seed is up nst. PI know what I'm talking about for I got some seed from both •es (and this was selected ears) happening to have very good nds there, but it could not be made to test more than about per cent. As was to be expected this corn was unsatisfactory in yield. This year our county will have a lot of good see.d and some to spare, a large part of which was gathered in September and first part of October. This may not strictly belong to my subject, but it explains in part the seed situation and the crying need for a general reform in method of growing and distributing farm seeds, which have been grown pure and are adapted to the locality. There is a large field for enterprising young men, who have some knowledge of plant life, are painstaking, and endowed with a full measure of patience. To progress in this work, the seed grower whether on a large or small scale must resort to a system of plot work to test out varieties, strains, and individual plants, and to isolate standing individuals for breeding by crossing or multiplying. PERSONAL BLUNDERS If I should state some of my experiences I would have to admit blunders as well as successes. For example thirteen years ago at a corn show here at Lincoln I bought two and one-half bushels corn, paying $1.50, which was fifty cents for "extra select." This Ehad a recommendation from a good source, so I tenaciously k to it, even working it in individual ear plots for two years, when we began variety testing we soon found it was not in the , it was not our corn. This year in order to get my variety test plot away from a pure seed field I planted the varieties on new land. That was another blunder. In the spring the cut worms got into most of it, and later the corn root louse prevented a part from filling out. I thing we have got our bearing now however, since we organ - ized for co-operation under the direction of the Experiment Station. VARIETY TESTING Our first work was laying aside a plat along any field of corn for variety testing which has been carried on for three years by </seg>
            <seg id="p308">308 tHave found the best results by raising a tried field, even in and comparatively free from worms, planting as thick as planter drop, thinning later to three stalks per hill when plants have ned about six inches in height. Each variety is duplicated once rows each and all work is to be equal in manner and time, ng the husking until December 1st, when all may be dried It is necessary to weigh the corn, for big ears with big cobs deceptive. t Generally white corn has the most large, even ears, but so far yellow has outyielded. This work will be concluded after two years, and we expect to profit by past experience. COMPETITION In breeding by the competition plan we have used separate plots where convenient, or else on some protected side along field of same variety. The second year we planted half an acre again from the best ears of last years plot, planting the balance of seed next. The method we use in getting the stand thick enough, the largest plots are used coming back in rows, planting twice in some rows. When the corn is big enough it is thinned down to 4 or 5 stalks per hill. At tasseling time every other row is detached, going over it every other day until the last stoolers have finished. At husking time only good ears hanging on standing stalks were accepted for this years breeding plot. EAR TO ROW I By the ear to row method an even piece of ground anywhere the field is all right for the first year when mother ears are ed, in fact it must have a margin of corn all around to protect ■a rodents on fence lines, turning with teams or strong winds Fifty ears usually have been selected. About five kernels in each hill with rows of fifty hills have been planted by hand, (a man with a stick). That method is not satisfactory since some corn goes through to the bottom while another hill in a horse track doesn't get to moisture at all, making an uneven stand. There is no tool to beat the field planter to correct that, and I shall use that after this. Have been advised to thin to two per hill, yet it has occurred that corn which stools takes advantage where stand is thinner not giving the non-stooling a fair show. A check row of common field corn is planted after every tenth row to correct varia - tion in soil. We started the first year by duplicating but now con - sider it not worth^twice the work for practical purposes. During the crowing season notes are taken; for instance, time of appearance, general thrift, date of tasseling, maturity, sire and character of stalk. After a rain storm the rows which stand up or lie down are noted. The first of December each row is picked separately, by two men </seg>
            <seg id="p309">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 309 rie wagon which is partitioned. One row is picked into the front and the other into the rear end, then weighed at end of row by a third man, who checks up the rows and keeps the record. The corn is then piled at the ends of rows and when through is judged for quality. All the good ears which made the best yields, for field planting the following year are picked out from each row respectively, or increased. THE BREEDING PLOT OR INCREASE I For our breeding or increase plots we selected two lots absolutely ated which we found this year on one side of an oat field next the road where there was a hedge. That wasn't a good thing ugh as it sapped out a few rows next to it. It was bounded on ee sides by farm places and pasture and on the other no corn i within eighty rods. Six ears with the best all round records e planted in two plots twenty-five roads apart, three ears in each t for increase. This year the best ears from each plot will be nted in alternate rows, for crossing by detasselling. This will uire an isolated plot of about three acres, the progeny of which I go into the general field the year following. SMALL GRAIN I have dwelt at some length on maintaining the corn plot, since breeding of grains on account of its self fertilizing habits must be left with the experiment stations. These strains or new varieties need trying out however, so we make it a point to lay out a portion of a field for comparative trial, taking care that both kinds get equal chance, keeping the actual seeds from mixing from seeding till threshing is over and it is in the bin. If it is found to have especial merit, we distribute it to our neighbors and friends, for a fair compensation, of course. If it hasn't that, we are welcome to keep it for our trouble. Some time is required in maintaining a proper system, and much time has been wasted by many, myself not excepted by grop - ing in the dark, getting experience. But thanks to our station experimenters and other practical men we now think we begin to see the light. SWEET CLOVER, ITS REAL VALUE TO THE FARMER By Louis Macey, North Platt*, Neb. Sweet Clover is a name to conjure. At first it was* used in con - junction with strong language and anathema to conjure up distrust and opposition. The fact is generally recognized (by wise people at least) that those who use strong language often do so because they an short on real facts for argument, but then it didn't coat any- </seg>
            <seg id="p310">310 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thing to believe the traducers of sweet clover, and that makes a big difference. Now that we are asking people to spend some money and ex - pend some energy in trying to grow it, they are more cautious and ask, "What are the qualifications of this speaker (or writer)? Has his experience and observation been short and superficial or long continued and thorough?" Last but not least, "is he prejudiced so he can see only one side, or has he honestly gone all around and examined every side so he can play fair with us?" On this last count especially the beekeeper has often been adjudged an incompetent witness. So before I go into the subject of the value of sweet clover to the farmer I must not only establish my authority for saying what I do, but also clear myself of the suspicion of being a prejudiced witness. My experience with sweet clover dates back eight years. Since that time I have lived among it, fought it in the beet field, mowed it in the meadows, stacked it, fed it and even tried it for greens. It is true I get a ton or so of honey from it each year but I get more value from the hay than the honey. The wild hay meadows here along the railroad are being in - vaded by it a little more each year; and while it is now pretty generally conceded that it rather improves the feeding quality of the hay, it is mean to bale and lowers the price of the hay on the market. I generally buy some each year. Bought seven ricks last winter, and this winter I sold alfalfa and bought the sweet clover-prairie hay mixture. Where I could readily grow red clover I would never bother with sweet clover nor yet where it is practicable to grow alfalfa, unless I wanted a short rotation. It will fit into that better than alfalfa and is easier to plow up and kill. I omitted to say that I had farmed land where sweet clover had grown. I say it now and more. I have never seen anything that put land in better "fix," not even red clover. It is somewhat of a nuisance along fence rows where there is no stock on either side, and in odd corners. It is harder to cut with a scythe than weeds; and in such places I have never been able to prevent its seeding. In a beet field where it has to be pulled out of the hill when thin - ning, it is troublesome. A neighbor who grows small grain on the same field year after year finds it an unmitigated nuisance. It is this very persistence under difficulties that makes it to valuable, it will grow where nothing else will, and grow great. Where it takes the hay meadows is in the thin spots. When young the plants are as easily killed with a hoe or cultivator as lambs - quarter or careless weed, and much easier than cockleburs. I have never had the least trouble with it in either corn field or potato patch, nor yet along fence rows where there is stock on one side, except that I have had cattle break a wire when reaching for it. While it U probably the greatest honey plant known I would </seg>
            <seg id="p311">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 311 unhesitatingly say it is many, many, times more valuable to the farmer than to the bee men. Its greatest value I would place as the soil renovator for the millions of acres of impoverished farm land that is now one of our greatest nation-wide economic problems. The grain belt farmers tell us (and they ought to know) that they cannot afford to keep enough stock to restore the lost fertility. Commercial fertilizers may help, but they cannot restore the most important element of all — humus. As the humus content of the soil decreases, its water-holding capacity decreases rapidly and it washes worse. -Without humus it would be impossible to put (and keep) soil in such mechanical condition as to permit the entrance of air and the growth of bacterial life that we now know to be so necessary to plant growth. In thirty years of experience and observation I have never seen land rich in humus but what was rich enough every other way to grow big crops, and I know of nothing that will make more growth (of dry matter) and hence furnish more humus on thin land than sweet clover. On such land it is hard to start red clover or alfalfa, and the growth of either is apt to be stunted even if a catch is secured — but not so sweet clover. Some tell us they tried hard and failed. No doubt of it — sweet clover has its conditions of growth and these must be met. I remember reading of one of our nursery - men trying to grow the bull pine, and though supplying what was ideal conditions for the other pines, he failed right along until he went out where the bull pine grew native (in Scotts Bluff county I think) there he saw where the seeds dropped on the hard baked soil and with no shade whatever, grew and thrived with no sign of "damping off." Wise in his generation he took a lesson from nature and success crowned his efforts. I know my subject is not the (rowing but the value of sweet clover; nevertheless, the value of a thing very much depends on how hard or how easy it is to grow, so I am going to say that "trying hard" and supplying the ideal condition for small grain or alfalfa is not the way at all. To begin with, the sweet clover seed has a very hard and im - pervious outer covering. At the North Dakota Experiment Station they tried soaking it in dilute acids to partially eat away this cover - ing. At Washington the government experts devised a machine to throw the seed against a steel plate so aa to crack the hull. In both cases an increased per cent of germination was secured. But why not take a lesson from nature, and in fact let nature do it. Here year after year like the nurseryman, I see the sweet clover cast its seed on the hard baked ground. The sun, dew and frost weaken and crack the hard outer covering, and in its own natural time, very early in the spring, it comes up "thick as the hair on a dog's back." It starts before the weeds, gets ahead of them, smothers them. It gets ahead of hot sun time. Frost and freeze don't hurt it. its roots go down and loosen the hard baked soil "to its own no- </seg>
            <seg id="p312">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 312 tion" when it needs it loose. Try nature's way once. Get some seed and sow it now. Sow it on the poorest land you've got. Haul out some hay and feed the cattle on it. Let them tramp it in and firm the soil. All the better if it's wet and they puddle it some on top, this is especially true if the land is sandy and in - clined to blow, otherwise you will need to scatter a little manure or straw on such land. Try a little patch at least this way, then you won't need to be told how easy it is to grow. Then next fall just before frost mow it and make hay of it. It will be 1 to 2 feet high and no trouble to cut, no trouble to cure, no trouble to stack and nearly, if not quite, as good as alfalfa. Next year let it grow. It will get up 3, 4, 5, or 6 feet high. If you're afraid of the seed coming up next year plow it under just before they ripen, otherwise wait till after frost when it's dead and easier for the horses to get through. In either case you'll grow some corn there next year — my word for it. §lt it is desired to use for pasture, I would be a little careful the year and even at the beginning of the second. Some say it not bloat like red clover or alfalfa, but — keep watch. I All that my cows get of it is by reaching under the fence and i would think that much of it would queer the taste of the milk, i have never had it do so, and I have seen the "town herd" tured in a field of it up to their backs for months and never ird any complaint. It will make more pasture and sustain more ck on a given area of thin land than any other pasture grass I &gt;w of; and unless pastured very close will reseed itself all ready start the biennial process over again. II don't like the second year growth of pure sweet clover for r. If cut before it gets woody — before it blooms, as recommended the government bulletin, it is almost impossible to cure it; and lave no more confidence in its feeding value than in oat hay cut ore it blooms, or corn fodder cut before it is in silk and tassel, the other hand, if cut just as the first seeds begin to harden, it good feed, is fairly easy to cure and produces an enormous ton - ;e with no greater percentage of waste than corn fodder. But "knocks a good mower all to pieces" to cut it. It's not only ■an to rake and sweep but to the man on the stack its "sumpun rce." To the man who hauls it out of the stack it's even worse. (Mr. Frank Coverdale of Iowa, reports a plan that strikes me being about the best yet, and that is to cut with a binder and cut h. This plan not only eliminates the cutting and handling of the irse hard part of the stem (which is not eaten anyway) but ves it on the ground to plow under; and what (to some at least) more important still, the high stubble will shoot out side stems Bcient to reseed itself, or under favorable conditions even make seed crop. Under present conditions a seed crop ought to be a money maker. The seed is generally quoted at about the same price as alfalfa. Sweet clover will not only yield much greater than </seg>

In the eight years I've been here I have se - i one crop of alfalfa seed but have never failed to see the sweet ;r seed heavily. Why don't I cut a seedcrop then? Well there's one binder in a ten mile radius and it would be very uncertain t getting a thresher unless one had a lot of it; then we are rally head over ears in prairie hay and alfalfa all summer. "Sandhillers" here are beginning to cut it along the railroad haul up and feed on the old fields and blowouts. The last dry years have not been favorable, but what they have got has uraged them to "keep on till it does rain again." One who has trying to seed both sweet clover and alfalfa says he has "got ! sweet clover and no alfalfa" so he is going stronger on the To summarize, I will say the value of sweet clover is summed up No. 1 It will grow where nothing else will Wherever I have seen it grow, it grows great, even on very thin land. It is easier to start than clover or alfalfa. It fits into a rotation of crops. It is the greatest soil enricher known. It leaves the land in the best possible mechanical condition It is not hard to eradicate in cultivated fields. I It makes good hay, and is also fine for pasture. Hogs do fine it. With the present price and demand for seed it will beat a wheat crop all to pieces. </seg>

Nebraska Second in Value of Farm Property -The per capita value of Nebraska farm property is 56.5 '&lt; more than the average valuation of the ten states of the corn belt. These states are: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa Nebraska, Missouri and Kansas. Value of the Corn Crop — Nebraska stands second in the per capita value of the corn crop; Nebraska's corn crop brings an annual per capita value to her farmers of 45.5% more than the average of these ten states. Value of the Wheat Crop — Nebraska stands second in per capita value of the wheat crop; in yield per acre Nebraska leads Kansas, her chief competitor, 25', annually in bushels per acre. The per capita value of the Nebraska wheat crop is 94.7 % more than the average of the cornbelt states. ■ Value of Oats — Nebraska ranks fifth in oats; she leads five the corn belt states 58.5'; in the per capita value of this crop. Value of Rye — Nebraska ranks fourth in value of rye; the per capita value of her rye crop is 119% more than the average of six of the corn belt states. t Value of Potatoes — Nebraska ranks fourth in potatoes; the capita value of Nebraska potatoes is 93.5% more than the rage of six of the corn belt states.

            <seg id="p377">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 377 RANK OF TEN STATES BY POINTS LOOK AT NEBRASKA'S SWINE (Bulletin issued November 12, 1912) Did you know that Nebraska leads the world in the number and value of her swine, according to the number of people engaged in farming? The civilized world buys Nebraska pork. This state not only has the greatest hog market in the United States, but it also keeps that market busy. Listen to the story of Nebraska's swine in tabloid form: Nebraska had on January 1, 1912, nearly twice as many swin on her farms as her sister state of Kansas, which has 48,163 mar farms than Nebraska. Nebraska has four-fifths as many swine as the three states of Kansas, Minnesota and South Dakota, whic have 281,844 more farms than Nebraska. That's some hogs, bu there is more of it: t Nebraska has twice as many swine, worth more than twice as :h money, as the eleven far western states of Colorado, Montana, oming, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, California. For every person on her farms, Nebraska can count hogs; the eleven far western states have only four hogs for ry six persons on their farms. The value of Nebraska swine per n is $289. The value of the swine in the eleven far western es is $48 per farm. And still people occasionally leave Nebraska the far west, tempted by the spiel of the land boomer. Nebraska sells about forty million dollars worth of pork every year. Oregon buys eleven million dollars worth every year. There's difference.

            <seg id="p378">378 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (Nebraska has almost twice as many swine as all Canada. She as 20,000 more swine than the entire United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, the Channel islands, and the Isle of Man. In proportion to population Nebraska has thirty times as many hogs as Great Britain. Nebraska can raise hogs cheaper and mature them quicker than any part of the United States, taking the state as a whole. Her wonderful crops of corn and alfalfa solve the problem of economical feeding and her great market at Omaha, the third largest in the United States, enables her producers to get the maximum of profit. This is another reason why Nebraska is a good state to live in. Silk purses cannot be made from a sow's ears, but Nebraska farmers are turning whole hogs into substantial bank accounts and good homes. NEBRASKA'S GREAT WHEAT CROP (Bulletin issued November 5, 1912) Fifty million bushels of wheat is incomprehensible unless it is stated in comparative terms. The wheat crop of Nebraska this year is 50,662,347 bushels, according to the returns gathered by the state bureau of statistics. This great crop was raised on 3,202,416 acres of Nebraska soil, the best on earth. Placed in one field five miles wide, this would make a solid wheat field from Chicago to Denver, but it would have to all be in Nebraska to grow such a crop; keep it inside the limits of Nebraska and it would make a field fourteen miles wide, reaching from the Missouri river to the Colorado line. There are about 628,000 people actually living on the farms of Nebraska; the value of this wheat crop is equivalent to seventy dollars for each man, woman and child on these farms, or about $350 per family. Loaded for shipment, seven hundred bushels to the car, this single grain crop from Nebraska farms would fill 72,375 cars of twenty tons capacity each; assembled in trains of thirty cars, it would fill a single track railroad from New York to San Francisco, allowing a mile and one-half to each train. Every bushel of this wheat will make sixty-nine loaves of bread; baked into pound loaves, this 1912 wheat crop would make about three and one-half billion loaves; this is bread enough to furnish thirty loaves for every person in the United States for their next year's food and have a surplus sufficient to hand one loaf to every soul in Mexico, Great Britain, Germany, France, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Holland, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Spain and Turkey. Nebraska is doing her share toward feeding the world. It takes water to raise wheat — lots of water. In the country </seg>
            <seg id="p379">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 379 where farmers irrigate their crops it requires one and one-half acre - feet to raise a wheat crop; this costs about seventy-five cents an acre after the cost of putting in the irrigation plant is paid for. To water Nebraska's 1912 wheat crop on this plan would have cost two and one-half million dollars. This money was saved to the farmers of Nebraska and they will have it in their bank accounts when they sell their wheat. It pays to farm where the water falls from the sky. Measured by the importance of the wheat crop, Nebraska is a good place in which to live; there are many other reasons equally good. Put your money into Nebraska land and keep it there. NEBRASKA'S FUTURE PROSPERITY (Bulletin issued November 26, 1912) The farm products of Nebraska, including her live stock, reached the inconceivable total last year of $609,222,466; this is $510 for every person residing in the state; $2,550 per family of five. The prosperity of Nebraska's farms is shared by every soul within her borders. Compare this with any other agricultural community on earth and you will feel proud of Nebraska, for she leads the procession. In the next ten years Nebraska will produce from her farms and sell in the market places of the world products equal in value to one-sixth of all the present value of all the farms in the United States, including the value of the lands, of the buildings, of the implements, machinery, live stock and all present improvements. Is it worth anything to have a part in that? And this much can and will be done, without materially in creasing the present rate of production per acre. When the boys now learning the principles of successful agriculture in the schools begin to apply their knowledge, Nebraska production will increase materially. The boys in the corn contests are now raising twice as many bushels per acre as the old farmers; when these boys get to running the farms the railroads will have to build double tracks. Nebraska is peculiarly fortunate in having some advantages not possessed by less favored states; she has 40,000 square miles of loess soil, wonderful in its almost inexhaustible fertility and unmatched in the western hemisphere. She has transportation and market facilities unrivalled in their efficiency. She has the best organization of her agriculture for business of any state in the Union. She has a public school system without a peer. Nebraska does not have to build these agencies — she has them. Get this into your consciousness.

For the stores of plenty which fill our garners and for the promise of still larger future blessings, Nebraskans have abundant reason for gratitude and hopefulness for this Thanksgiving day. NEBRASKA FARMER WINS HIGH HONORS (Bulletin issued October 28, 1913) Arnold Martin, owner of twenty acres near DuBois, Nebraska, last week took individual awards at the Tulsa, Oklahoma, Inter - national Dry Farming Congress and exposition, aggregating $1,125. This was his score up to Sunday, according to information received by the State Board of Agriculture. Besides the above in individual awards he will get sweepstakes in corn, vegetables and potatoes as well as grains. The competition was keen, entries being made from all parts of the world. The Tulsa World gracefully hands the praises to Nebraska and the Nebraska man in the following comment in last Sunday's paper: "Arnold Martin of DuBois, Nebraska, is the all around cham - pion farmer of the International Soil Products Exposition. Mr. Martin came into his own by winning a total of $1,125 worth of prizes in a number of classes that were hotly contested. To begin with, Mr. Martin, whose exhibit occupies half of one row in the state exhibits building No. 2, showed a collection of grass and forage seeds which were not equalled in the entire exposition. It won for him an Ann Arbor combination hay baler and six horse power gasoline engine complete -value $750 — given by the Ann Arbor Machine Company of Ann Arbor, Michigan. This baler is adapted to any make of engine and Mr. Martin may select any make of engine and the company will buy it for him and ship the whole, freight prepaid, to DuBois, Nebraska. " Martin also won $100 in gold, given by the Holt Manufactur - ing Company of Peoria, Illinois, for the best collective exhibits made by a farmer from the products of his own farm. For his exhibit of grasses and forage crops he will be given a Kansas City hay press valued at $225 and donated by the Kansas City Hay Press Company of Kansas City. A Pattee surface cultivator also went to Mr. Martin for the best display of all varieties of corn. This is valued at $40." In his letter, Mr. Martin says, that if he had stayed out of the individual classes and entered his exhibits as a state exhibit he </seg>

' He won the sweepstakes on corn and a number of medals on grains and vegetables. The scoring is not finished yet and he has a chance at various premiums, medals and trophies. Mr. Arnold has a farm of twenty acres. He uses intensive methods and devotes his whole attention to the twenty acres. He has attracted much attention by his heavy winnings at the Nebraska State Fair, Des Moines, Kansas City and Chicago, and many other fairs and expositions. NEBRASKA LIVE STOCK PLENTY A Three Section Train Lands Over Hundred Carloads of Stock The Kansas City Drovers' Telegram prints the following inter - esting item about a shipment of Nebraska live stock: " We still have some live stock to market, judging from the run we brought down this morning," is the way F. P. Fisher of Guide Rock, Nebraska, expressed himself after landing on the second section of a train cf stock of fifty-four cars. f "Those three sections were loaded with cattle, hogs and sheep, d there is still left some more to come. Of course, we find that the bulk of the fed cattle have been marketed, but so far as the hog supply is concerned, that is very uncertain, as they keep coming all the time." Few people realize the wide expanse of territory covered by shipments of Nebraska live stock; for several years the Pacific northwest has relied largely on Nebraska for pork, and during the first nine months of 1909 nearly one-half of the hogs ehipped to the Portland Union stock yards came from this state. The western packers pay a liberal premium to attract shipments of Nebraska stock, not only because of the superior quality, but also because the local shipments from their immediate tributary teiritory alone do not suffice to keep their plants running to their capacity. The writer heard the manager of the live stock department at the Panama- Pacific Exposition of 1915 urging Oregon breeders to bestir them - selves, "for," said he, "when those Nebiaska breeders come to the San Francisco show with their herds they will make you fellows hard to have a 'look in' unless you get busy." </seg>
            <seg id="p382">382 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE LOOKING FOR THE END OF THE RAINBOW It Comes Down in Nebraska Seven hundred farm families from the United States have been going into Canada every day for some time past, attracted by the "cheap land" and the enterprising publicity of the Canadian rail - roads, aided by the government of that country. Last week a solid train of thirty cars of farm goods with the respective owners left Nebraska to go into northern Minnesota. A single real estate firm dealing in Texas lands boasts that it has sold three-quarters of a million in these lands to Nebraskans in the past four months. All of these people are looking for a pot of gold at the end of the rain - bow. If they would look about a bit they would discover that the rainbow comes down in Nebraska both ends of it — with gold at the grass roots. There is but one state in the entire forty-eight which surpasses Nebraska in accumulated agricultural weath — its sister state, Iowa — and at the present rate of production, Nebraska will lead the column within ten years. Some of these good folks who are flocking to the ends of the earth in search of opportunity are going to get stung, and after the pain and swelling have subsided, are going to experience a deep longing for the opportunities they have left behind in good Nebraska. SHORT SUMMARY OF INFORMATION ABOUT STATE FAIRS By Warren H. Manning, Boston, Massachusetts R State fairs are rapidly proving to be among the important ctors of state education. They are being so regarded all over the country, and where instituted in the past, and planned without due regard for future broad-minded educational function, the trustees are studying the question of replanning and rebuilding to fit better the future needs. Whereas, buildings were formerly flimsy, temporary wooden structures, the buildings now erected are planned for the future, and are of fire-proof permanent construction, generally of concrete, though brick has been much used. tin several cases states have retained the services of eminent scape designers and architects, to get not only the benefit of rienced knowledge of the needs of utility and convenience, but to get orderly arrangement and a handsome appearance. The states are, many of them, proving to be very generous in their present and proposed appropriations for state fairs. The most magnificent scheme is that of New York state, which is rapidly appropriating money to make up the proposed total of nearly $2,000, - 000. Minnesota and Illinois have over $1,000,000 invested in their </seg>
            <seg id="p383">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 383 state fair grounds and buildings, and Texas and Iowa more than three-fourths of a million. f Although there is strong similarity between the functions of fferent state fairs, there is no single type to which they are all made to conform. Most of them have about 120 acres, which seems to provide ample room for building, circulation, amusement features, and a one mile track. It has been a custom to keep the area in the middle of the track free from any large permanent buildings, although parts of it are frequently used by temporary features during the park season. The best types show four kinds of buildings. RThe first, administration, includes space for the officers of the unds, police, fire, press and hospital, shops for repairs, a large auditorium and grandstand, and waiting and railroad stations. Under this head also comes a building for state institutions, in which the aims and methods of institutions maintained by the state are explained and illustrated, which has a most valuable educational function. The second and third groups of buildings, live stock and agriculture, horticultuie and forestry are direct development of the main functions of the old type of state and county fai's, where the people themselves exhibit their own best animals and crops, gener - ally for prizes; whce they can see the best types of animals, crops, etc., and compare methods of treatment. Of the live stock build - ings, there is considerable variation of types, but regularly the accomodatior for horses and cattle are far the most important. Sometimes as many as twelve or moie buildings are devoted to each. In othei cases, all are assembled under one roof. Apparently the lattei procedure is now piefeired, and large buildings for this purpose aie being planned for the future, where several small buildings are now used. Comparatively small quarters are always devoted to (a) sheep and swine; (b) poultry; (c) dairy; (d) (occasionally) kennels and breeding stables, and (e) the judging pavilion. This last is of great importance, and widely makes one of the great features of the ground. It is often a large building in which are all conveniences, including a covered track fcr exhibiting animals to great audiences. There are also in the larger fairs special buildings planned for feeds. Under agriculture, horticulture, and forestry, one finds buildings for agriculture and horticulture often with greenhouses. Forestry is rapidly achieving an important place for itself as a popular exhibit. I The fourth group is under liberal and fine arts. The largest dings in fairs are always devoted to liberal art. Exhibits are n combined in different ways under different buildings, but in all cases, the object is to exhibit types of farm implements, carriage and motor vehicles, and the different manufactures and resources of interest to the audience, especially those of the state. Domestic science is rapidly growing in popular esteem, and a </seg>
            <seg id="p384">384 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE separate building is built or planned for this department of the intelligent activity of the women. A building for fine arts is often put up more frequently in middle western and western states than in the east, and promises to be of great value, although usually very small. Other types of buildings which are universally found, although seldom is any definite place designed for their occupation, are amuse - ment concessions, such as theatres, dance halls, etc. Consequently, they are usually crowded and inconveniently arranged. As there seems to be no diminution in the popular interest in this feature of the state fairs, it would seem proper that ample space should be provided for them, where they can be properly controlled. At present, few fair grounds are of use to the people beyond the short season when they are formally open. This is, of course, a considerable economic waste of valuable land, which will in time undoubtedly be remedied, perhaps in the way that has been proven so valuable at the Canadian National Exposition, at Toronto, where the fair grounds form a beautiful lake park for the people thoughout the year. ESTABLISHING A REPUTATION By Frank J. Rist Reputation like character building cannot be accomplished in night. It is a task of a life time. What I have to say along this line will be largely from my own experience and not from a general knowledge of the business. If I were to say, in a few words, how to make the seed business go, they would be, " Make your goods worth the price you ask for them and people will buy." Nebraska is primarily an agricultural state — by virtue of her location, rainfall, climate and soil. Therefore, it seems to me that our association has a bright future, as there will always be a good demand for pure seeds. Society is demanding more foodstuffs from the farm each suc - ceeding year. The increase in the future must come from increased acre yields. Available land has been largely occupied and the corn growing area pushed to its limit. I believe it is easiei to increase our yield of corn 15 to 25 bushels per acre in eastern Nebraska, than to produce that amount on some of the newer corn growing sections. This probably could not be done with wheat or oats. Other nations have doubled their acre yields. They had to do it, and so will we. It took Great Britain a century to accomplish </seg>
            <seg id="p385">385 it. With the experience of other nations as a guide, it is possible to double ours in a single generation. KI do not say that good seed will double it, but I do believe our acre yield can be increased cheaper by the use of good than any other way. will not do all, but it is an absolute necessity in the uction of a full crop. As Americans we are progressive, whether we are Bull Moosers or not. I In order to retain our reputation as leaders, we should do as at least, as other nations have done. We must keep improving, an who stops improving is dead, whether he is buried or not. §We are living in an age of specialties. In order to make progress g any line of work today, we must devote considerable time and y to that special work. Have a hobby of your own and ever - ngly ride it. tOne special line of work with proper study and attention will ; more pleasure »nd profit than can be obtained in any other BIf you have too many irons in the fire, you are liable to take temper out of all of them. My work, up to the present time, has been largely with corn, although I am growing pure wheat and oats now. LI believe there should be a pure seed grower in every locality, would be a public benefit, as his seed would be acclimated and ild supply his locality. tMany farmers imagine seeds are better after they have had a ride in a box car*. I have sold seed corn in a dozen different s. Sometimes shipping it hundreds of miles. They should have hased their seed as pear home as possible. There seems to be a feeling of jealousy among farmers. They think seed of their own growing is just as good, because it waa produced in the same locality and under similar conditions. "A prophet hath no honor in his own country," is as true today as it ever was, when it comes to the seed business. This is due largely to a lack of understanding among farmers. A seed grower, of course, is in the business, because he expects to build up a reputation — a business that will make him some money; but I have found out that it is not all profit, selling seed at considerably above market price. It takes lots of time, work and expense to properly select, store and market seed that will satisfy a customer and thereby advertise your business. Seeds should stand on their own merits, and should be advertised as they are. The first thing to do is to get prospective buyers to inquire for customers, exhibiting at corn shows, and in advertising. LThe inquiry received should be answered at once, with a neat active catalog. 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p386">386 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A catalog is essential, as it is the only satisfactory way of describing your different varieties of seeds. Only a small per cent of the inquiries will require a personal answer. I Photos of growing crops and farm scenes help to make an ictive catalog. A good photo will tell more than several pages rint. tlf orders cannot be filled within a day or two after receiving , it is well to drop the purchaser a card and let him know his order will be filled at your earliest convenience. II always give the purchaser the privilege of keeping or returning seed after ten days time. This gives ample time for testing examining. Then, if he is not satisfied, return them and his ey is refunded. Cash should always accompany all orders. If an order by phone, it should be reaffirmed by letter, that you may have record of same. §In case cash does not accompany order, your goods should be ped C. O. D. This is a sound business principle when dealing strangers. It is only fair that you have his money, while he your goods. I If, for any reason, a customer is not satisfied with results ined, I believe it is best to compromise with him in some way, &gt;ugh it takes the profit or more from the deal. Satisfied customers build up your reputation. (In rega'd to prices, good farm seeds are worth all you can get them. It is better for all concerned to sell good seeds for a i price, than to sell pool seed for a lower price. Keep the price and make good goods, worth the price. All seeds should be thoroughly tested, cleaned and graded before shipping. First-class seeds are the only kind it pays to handle. Good new sacks with your name and location on them will help some. tMany farmers have purchased seeds that were misrepresented to Consequently they have lost confidence in the seed men. must restore this confidence by placing seed upcn the market will make good. I believe the farmers will purchase seeds of various kinds, if they know they are pure and true to name. IOur association must establish a reputation among farmers, by wing that we have the goods. » Judging from some of the transactions of some seed men, one aid conclude that they consider it easier to get a new customer, n it is to satisfy and keep an old one; however, we cannot afford establish ? reputation like this one. I After all, building up a business that will make money is not one should strive fo*. We owe society our very best. We must get so wrapped up in our business, that we forget our duty to fellowmen — our neighbor. </seg>

Burnett iThe College of Agriculture at the University Farm increased its tration over 1910-1911 about twenty-five per cent. The College tration for the current year will probably reach 350. In addi - to this number, about 125 women who are registered in other ges in the University take the Home Economics work offered le University Farm. IThe registration in the School of Agriculture for the current is about forty more than last year, reaching 425 young men women. In addition to this, about 175 young men are registered he Winter Course. At the present time there is very great for additional buildings at the Farm, since all class rooms are in use an average of thirty hours per week, making it practically issible to schedule any additional classes consecutively through week. KM appropriation of $85,000 for an additional building is avail - and the contract for the erection of this building has been let. building will house Agricultural Botany, Horticulture, and nology, and will furnish additional class rooms for some other cments. The appropriation for Farmers' institute work in the state has been increased to $17,500 per year. It is proposed to use this additional appropriation in the extension of regular Farmers' in - stitutes, in the holding of additional extension schools, and in the development of correspondence courses in agriculture for farmers who cannot attend the College. This department has been reorganized, under the head of the department of Agiicultural Extension, and the permanent staff available for this work has been considerably in - creased. There can be no question of the very great necessity at this time of developing agricultural extension work. The knowledge now available from the experiment stations and the colleges of agriculture is very much more extensive than that which is in use among the farmers, and some larger means of publicity must be available than have been used in the past for carrying this knowledge to the people. </seg>
            <seg id="p388">388 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A movement is on foot, supported by the national organization of agricultural colleges and experiment stations, to secure a federal appropriation for agricultural extension work which will be placed in charge of the authorities govfrning the agricultural colleges. Should this appropriation pass congress, it will enable vs to greatly increase the amount of extension work and to reach more people in an effective way. It ought not, however, to be necessary foi a state like Nebraska to depend upon the national government for money to carry on a line of work which gives so large returns for the money expended, ard it is probable that, regardless of national appropriations, more funds will be available in the future fo» this purpose, as. they become necessary. About 191 two day institutes are bfing held this year. Nire junicr extension schools and six senior extension schools have been held 01 are scheduled to be held durirg the winter. A detailed schedule will be furnished you later, if you have not already received the same. The lines of investigation at the substations during the past summer were greatly interfered with by excessive drouth, but the work which these stations have done in normal years demonstrates their value to the people as an aid to the development of the regions in which they are established. The bulletins from the North Platte station have been especially systematic and indicative of the pos - sibilities of farming upon the hard lands of Nebraska under condi - tions which have existed there in normal years. These bulletins have been widely sought by residents of other states living in the great plains area, indicating their adaptability not only to the great plains belt of the state of Nebraska, but to all the zone of limited rainfall east of the Rocky mountains, where climatic conditions are not widely at variance with those of the North Platte region. The most recent notable work of the central station is the development of improved strains of Turkey Red wheat. After eight years of selection, five strains have been selected from several thousand with which the experiment started. Four of these strains have been tested on individual farms in different parts of the state for one year. They yielded on the average five bushels per acre more than the local wheat grown by these farmers on adjacent land. The advantage of these selected strains over the local seed was most apparent where conditions were favorable to a good crop. Experiments recently completed show the great need of develop - ing the native varieties of seed corn in the different corn regions of the state, especially in the central and western parts, where all in - troduced varieties are uncertain and where all native varieties need to be bred for purity and improved type. Local corn improvers' associations should be organized in every county of the state to develop the native varieties, or the introduced varieties which have proved adapted to the region and which are now in most common use. Experiments in corn breeding also show that seed forced by </seg>
            <seg id="p389">reocmxiNoe Nebraska stats board op aqricultuhs 389 ftd cultivation and thin planting and selected from highly fertile ds does not yield under ordinary farm conditions as well as seed which has been grown under more normal conditions of thicker planting and harder composition. The number of well developed seed ears on an acre can be increased by furnishing highly favorable conditions, but properly developed ears grown under normal con - ditions from equally well selected seed, will give more satisfactory yields when planted by the farmer. Experiments in progress at the central station to determine the water requirements of growing plants have shown conclusively that more water is required to produce a ton of dry matter upon worn - out and infertile soils than upon rich productive soils. Experiments with corn during the last summer showed that it required 550 pounds of water to produce a pound of dry matter on very infertile soil where all loss of water from the surface of the soil was prevented. Upon a moderately fertile soil it required 480 pounds of water. Upon a fertile soil it required only 392 pounds of water. Upon all three of these soils, when finely composted manure was incorporated with the soil throughout the entire four feet of the depth which formed the feeding ground of the plant, the amount of water required varied from 340 to 350 pounds for each pound of dry matter. It is also well understood — although not shown in these experiments — that fertile soils containing high percentages of humus retain much more water than soils which are low in vegetable matter and humus. Recently published bulletins by the North Platte substation on the cost of growing a pig to weaning time (Bulletin 121) and the summary on growing hogs for market (Bulletin 123, in press) repres - ent the most extensive work done on this subject in the corn belt, and should be read by every farmer interested in pork production. These bulletins show that the cost per hundred of growing a pig to weaning time, including the cost of keeping the brood sow during the winter period, need not be greater than the average cost of growing a pig to market weight of 250 pounds. The best proportion between corn and alfalfa hay in fattening shoats has been shown to be about nine parts corn to one part hay by weight, although as much as one-quarter hay to three-quarters corn has been used with profit. Where good hay was placed in a rack and the pigs allowed to eat as much as they wished alcng with a full feed of coin, the most economical gains have followed. Where farmers practice grinding alfalfa hay with grain in their farm grinders, 100 pounds of alfalfa hay to 18 or 20 bushels of corn will be found most suitable for fattening purposes. Mature brood sows should be required to eat a much larger proportion of alfalfa. This can be done by limiting the grain ration and feeding hay in a rack. </seg>
            <seg id="p390">390 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PART OF ADDRESS DELIVERED BY DR. HENRY WALLACE BEFORE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FEBRUARY 21, 1913 Mr. Chairman and Solons (solons from that part of Iowa which lies west of the Missouri river): This looks quite natural, and I am exceedingly glad to have the opportunity to address you for fifteen minutes. Sometimes it seems to me that the Almighty in making all these worlds and suns and systems of worlds, said to himself, " I will make the best of this world, the Garden of Eden, right down here in the central part of these United States," and by some inscrutable Providence, or a mistake of the surveyor, part of it was left on this side of the Missouri river. Now the western part of Iowa and western Missouri are very much like part of Nebraska that was left on the east side. Our lands are of the same quality, they are tilled by the same kind of folks, and, therefore, I presume the same problems which confront us on the other side of the river are very much like those you have to solve here, and I will tell you just what we are doing there. I predict that here as there, you have the problem of taxation, the problem of roads, the problem of schools, and the problem of the care of the unfortunate, the derelicts, the waste of humanity. Now we are trying to solve the first problem of taxation by constitutional amendment which will do away with all general property tax for the support of the state, and turn into the state the portion of tax now take© by the railroads, the telephone companies, and all that kind of organizations, turn that into the state treasury, and we find that the difference between the amount that is paid by the counties and the general property to the state is practically the same as that which is owned by the railroads in the different por - tions of the state. Now it is our object to do away with the board of equalization; to sample out for taxing districts independently, so that where they have a high levy and a low valuation or a low levy and a high valuation. In other words, to have property valued high and assessment low. We have tried to get along without that high valuation for over twenty years, and it has always been a failure. We can do this only by amendment of the constitution. The next problem we have is roads, and we are trying to solve that by having a general state board that will devise the kind of bridges to be built, and take from the bridge builders the necessity of sweetening up various boards of supervisors in order to build a bridge. We are trying to get a good road from county seat to county seat, and then a good dirt road to the school house; that is what we are working for. With what success remains to be seen. I don't suppose your road problem is nearly so bad as ours, for the reason we have more mud, money, and misery, and they all go together. That makes your road problem a simple one. Another problem we have is the caring for our criminals — our </seg>
            <seg id="p391">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 391 waste. I have learned to my surprise from the board of control that the one million people of Iowa who live in the open country furnish 10 ', of the criminals, and a million and a quarter who live in the towns and cities furnish 90' ,. I learn from the same authority that the million of people who live in the country furnish 1 ' , of the juvenile criminals and defectives that have to go to the industrial schools, while the people in the towns and cities furnish 99', of that class. Hence it is dawning upon us that living in the open country is a means of grace, and farming is a means of grace; therefore, we had better buy farms and put our criminals on them and bring them back to sanity and honesty. Now the next problem we have is that of our schools. In our state as well as others, Iowa has outgrown its laws. Our legis - lative pants are too short in the legs, our legislative coats are too short in the sleeves, our vests are too tight, and when a boy gets in that fix, he is going to have a new suit of clothes. We have three colleges — a University, Agricultural College, and a Teachers' College — and unfortunately they are all controlled by a board of trustees. •«•••* They are competing with each other. •••••• Each found itself short of funds. Then they wanted more mill tax, and row they want more money than ever, and so we put them under the board of education, which is where they have been for about three years. Now here is a misery that all of our institutions have, and all we have been able to educate has been 1 ' ( of our farm boys, and we have spent so much money in buildings and in the support of educating the 1', that we have neglected the 99*^. But people of Nebraska are going to have an education; but you cannot get it in our higher institutions of learning, as they are now. I am thinking of the 99', that must be contented with the cheap country school, taught by an inexperienced village teacher, the school averaging about twelve in attendance. Here is a problem we have to solve. We find we have to have our agricultural college men trained to teach in the rural school. By and by we will have to have a centralized school, where the children can practice; that fits in not only with making a living, but for life, the life for which the child is born. We cannot go on as we have been here. We are aiming to keep our children, our high schools, our teacners' college, as near a possible out in the open country and under farm conditions. Now, gentlemen, pardon me fot taking your time for the one thing I have come up here to say. I like Nebraska, I pay some taxes in Nebraska. It requires no prophet to see where Iowa and Nebraska are going, if they keep on doing as they are doing now. Forty per cent of your land is tilled by tenants, or nearly so, and under one year leases, and one year leases simply mean the landlord and the tenant conspire to rob the land to the utmost and divide the piofits, robbing the property of all its life-giving qualities. That means the land is losing soil fertility; that means the time will come when Nebraska will be like the New England </seg>
            <seg id="p392">392 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE farms, and when the farms of Nebraska fail the towns will fail, all kinds of business will fail and the land will go into a decline. There is just one thing possible, and that is for your legislature to take the lead by enacting a law which will protect the tenant on his farm. That will make it to the interest of the tenant to increase the fertility of his land instead of decreasing it. That will make it to the interest of the owner to see that the land is increased in fertility instead, of decreased. If he takes the manure on his place and spreads it on his land and increases his yield the landlord asks higher rent, and unless he will pay it, he is put off the farm. Now the first thing to do is to enact a l?w that will protect the tenant and that will make it a necessity for the tenant to restore the fertility of the soil; that will set a high water mark for the farmers in the United States. Why is it that the tenant in New England is there for life instead of one year? Why is it that the son takes the father's place on the same farm, and the grandson the son's place? It is because the tenant is secure in his right; everything that he has done for which he has not received compensation, hence the landlord will not change tenants if he has a good one, because he has to pay for the exhausted lands. Hence you get away from the one year lease, which is the damnation of the land in any country; and to make a tenant good, he should give security before he is allowed to go onto this property. Now you are at the beginning in the west. A tenant who decreases the soil fertility means financial exhaustion to the state. That is the one thing I am insisting upon from our legislature, that they shall appoint a commission and conduct ar investigation of this whole thing in the light of what Europe has done. New England had to do that, and if our legislature, and yours, will do that, you will take the greatest step in progress made by any state that can be made. But, I tell you the welfare of the people of Nebraska is largely in your hands. Pass a law that will give the tenant an equity in the unexhausted fertility which he restores to the land, and then your name should be written large in the registry of progress. Just in the proportion that we develop agriculture, just in that proportion you fit people for life, and fit your own people who go to your agricultural colleges for the teaching of the things that pertain to life in your own schools because no state can be so important to us as people. It is the people who make the state, ard not the state that makes the people, and anything that we can do in these states to develop a larger, fuller and bet - ter life, our names will be written large in history, just in pro - portion as we do that. Gentlemen, I thank you. </seg>
