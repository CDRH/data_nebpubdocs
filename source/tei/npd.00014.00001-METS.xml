PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL ADDRESS E'entlrmen «/ the State Hoard of Agriculture: The flight of time has ught us to another annual meeting, a year has passed into history, whether record be for good or bad. it is beyond our ability to alter. The past year while one of profit to the agriculturist, has not been with - out its drawbacks and discouragements; the mtM was unpropitioi. our great staple product, corn, much of which was planted late owing to the excessive rains during the latter part of May and early June, which retarded the growth of that already planted, and the planting of the re - mainder, much of the crop being over-run with weeds before the ground was in a condition to cultivate in a satisfactory manner. KWe have rarely had a season with so little really good corn weather in m I remember when the corn planted remained green up In the middle of September as during the season just passed; the result ol conditions is quite a percentage of soft corn that will have to be fed at home Id at a low figure. Our wheat crop the State over is probably the largest ever raised; while - have ruled low. the revenue per acre is a fair return on the ii ment. Much of the State reports an abundant oat crop, which at the prices pre - vailing, must have proved remunerative. I Owing to the depression in the prices of cattle and hogs there is a wide - t disappointment in the money return from grass fed to live stock, yet. the whole, the agriculturist has no reason to complain at the outcome the year's business, but should take lessons from the year's experience d at once prepare to drain his low lying lands, so as to prevent the excess water lying on it to the prevention of timely cultivation. I More care should be exercised in the selection of seeds and the changing the same from one location to another, thereby increasing the yield per re and the net profit of the crop. While much has been done in the past to improve the domestic animals of the State there is yet a very large and prolific field open in this direction, and we should bend every energy to encourage further progress along The late fair was a success from the standpoint of both Datron and the </seg>

I The net result from a financial standpoint was all that could b&lt; mtion in a condition to put further | ; the grounds, in the doing of which much thought those improvements as will be of a character to add I lor as they are pie,; urres increased and our hold the public sympathy and confidence strengthened.

This was built mainly of brick and &lt; ■ hile far from being adequate for the demand made on it. r improvement over anything that we had ever had that it was I iblic voted a success. Your management realize that it did not r&gt;re than one-third of the accommodation required ; in view of this I commend that an addition be bin &gt;le. making itl pacify three times what it is at present. I There have been built during thi r two hog barns of the same neral style and capacity of those heretofore built. Thcr large and commodious sheep ban Oiich will amply pi r all demands made by this department for me. These iprovements cost $2.24S.(M). which was paid for out of funds imp - this Association. The interest of our patrons in the fish exhibit call for more ample spare; the building set apart for this display should as early as pos-i with a much larger and better one planned with a view to its nee.. accommodation of the public. I Our large live stock interests evidenced by the displays made, demand our hands greater facilities for their exhibit in such a way that the public %y examine them in comfort, and the stock be shown without beii:_ lied to stand in the broiling sun while passing under the judg lis should be accomplished by the building of an ampitheater ■ seating some thousands of people at a time where the li own in the center, out of the sun's rays and in full view of their enthusiastic ends, who rest while they examine them — the most inten ibh on e ground's.

To the end that this may be accomplished I recommend that you author - iie your officers to buy. at the time of the wrecking of the building! on the Louisiana Purchase Exposition grounds of one or more of the buil&lt; thus securing the steel for th lilding at a saving to this Associa' </seg>
            <seg id="p007">10 PROCEEDIN08 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. » As the financial success of the Association depends on the number of pay admissions secured at the gates, we are vitally interested in the facilities and comfort with which our patrons are brought to and taken from the grounds. It must remain a matter of regret that the street car people d avail themselves of the opportunity to enter the grounds and make their depot near that of the steam cars. To accomplish this, vigorous work should be commenced at once and persisted in till the desired end is accomplished. iThe dates assigned us by the International Association of Fair Managers August 29th to September 3rd, 1904, the week following the low:, r; there will be held during the same week the Ohio and Minnesota State rs. There was a very large attendance at the International Fair Mans - ers' Association meeting, and a marked interest in the subjects pro - • consideration. As your representative I attended the meeting of the American Short Horn Breeders' Association. The attendance at this meeting was large and enthusiastic. They show a net surplus of over $100,000.00 the larger part of which is invested in Government bonds, all of which has been accumu - lated during the last ten years, a marked contrast to their condition in when they were to all intents and purposes bankrupt. We have for years deducted from the successful exhibitor 209&lt;' of his win - nings, if over two dollars; it appears to me that this should be changed by the abolition of the rule. If necessary to have money thus raised, then let it be done by charging an entrance fee on the first premium competed for. In closing I wish to return thanks to all members for the uniform kindness they have manifested in- the alacrity with which they have responded to calls made for service to the board of managers. I wish to especially thank them for the earnestness with which they have served the interests of the board and responded to my various calls for assistance. The railroads of the state gave us large and additional service during the the last fair, which is shown byour increased receipts. This action on their part lays the Hoard under renewed obligations to them and makes plain the assertion often made that the roads can do much to make or mar the success of the fair; for this reason if for no other, we should strr their active interest* in their behalf. (Before the close of this meeting I shall have returned to you the honor nferred on me a year ago; in doing so I wish to assure you that I have •iven at all times to uphold the honor and dignity of the office, and of e Board, and to assure you that wherever placed as a member of the board the future it will be my endeavor to serve the Board to the best of my ilitv.

The Nebraska State Fair for 1903, that great object lesson school in ita line, all things considered, was without precedent in the history of her Fairs. With the exception of Wednesday, the weather was unobjectionable. Even that day could not be complained of in matter of attendance and gate re- ceipts. Both quality and quantity of live stock exhibits were particularly observable, rendering it difficult for expert judges to satisfy them- in manv instances, as to superiority in excellence. </seg>

"The forest problem is, in many ways, the most vital internal problem in the The more closely this statement is examined, the more evi - dent the truth becomes. In the arid region of the west, agriculture depends, ■f all, upon the available water supply. In such a region, forest pro - u alone can maintain the stream flow necessary for irrigation, and can prevent the great and destructive floods so ruinous to communities farther down the same stream, that heads the arid regioi In his message to the present Congress, now in session, he further adds to this important subject by saying: "The study of the opportunities for re - clamation of the vast extent of arid land, shows that whether this reclama - tion is done by individuals, corporation*, or tl he sources of water supply must be effectively protected and the reservoirs guarded by the pi vation of the forests at the head « -.

I have ever been of the opinion that evening entertainments at State Fairs are practical and can be made valuable factors in financial resources. Taken in connection with another matter to which I shall here call atten - tion. I have, since our last Fair, in seeking new and advanced Fair features. given unusual and careful thought to these ends. Without such entertainments, we naturally lose a large per cent of attendance from patrons in the city at which the Fair is held. Large contribu - tions and extra efforts by citizens competing for location of Fairs, are not made for " fun or glory." They are made from a financial and personally sted standpoint, to obtain respective shares of money left in the city during Fair week by visitors attending. This sum has been approximately and fairly estimated at from $250,000 to (400,000 during each Fair business men, and others who expect a share of this public contribution, are naturally busy, during day hours, taking it in, and hence do not attend the By information from states where night entertainments are in vogue, is are a decided success.

            <seg id="p024">27 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AUKICULTI'KE. Secretary of the Minnesota State Fair writes me that, before the introduc - tion of night entertainments were resorted to, their concession resource*, each season, averaged about $4,000. Since then, they have been over $16. - 000 in a year. Gate receipts correspondingly increased. This matter was under discussion at the late meeting of the Association of Fairs and Expositions at its session at Chicago, in December last. President Dinsmore of this Board, was a delegate in attendance, and may, if this matter elicits discussion by this Board, furnish you with more detailed information. These lines of thought in this matter leads me, in connection, to another matter I desire to present for your consideration. That is, the obligations existing between Fairs and their exhibitors; those who make Fairs. My -convictions are, and have alway^s been, that exhibitors should, where possi - ble, be relieved from all entrance fees; all per cent deductions from win - ners; all charges for space ; fees for stalls ami pens. To illustrate relations ■ between exhibitors and management. It is no trick to purchase and equip grounds. These may be of the very first order in all respei no exhibitors, there can be no Fair — no show to invite patrons to come and see — exhibitors make Fairs Premiums awarded directly, at best, but feebly compensate the exhibitor, especially is this so as to county col!' exhibitors. I have personally had much experience in this and know whereof I speak. With these assertions, I realize I am confronted with the fact that all State Fairs of which I have knowledge, revenue is derived in some shape from their exhibitors. All, except Nebraska, charge each entry 10 per on all first premiums as an entrance fee. We charge 20 per cent deduction off all winners on sums over $2.00. Thus we tax exhibitors less than any other state. Every encouragement and accommodation should be extended exhibitors, relieve them of all possible expense, will be to this end. This would be a new and advanced departure that would touch a popular chord in Fair affairs*; that would add immensely to our already popular and successful management. I am not slow to present these lines of thought for your consideration, because of their importance and my faith in them. tOur present sources of revenue will not, of course, permit this departure, believe, however, they are practical, and if inaugurated, gigantic results .uld follow. A word as to the finances, with us involved in this line, in the n indicated. Our income from stalls and pens the last year, was unprecedent - edly large, reaching $1,161. Our 20 per cent discount from winners was $2,021.00. Total sum, $3,182.00. This, I have no hesitancy in expressing a belief, could be handsomely overcome by evening entertainments, judiciously managed. twill not now and here undertake to discuss this matter further in detail, ieving it worthy of careful thought anil ■ presented you what it may be thought worth. </seg>

Mr. President atul Mrmher* aj the Stale Board of Agriculture: As Chairman f your Board of Managers I am pleased to say that the fair held the past season was, I believe, as good hs could !&gt;■ I from the facility &gt;oard has at the present time. It was instructive Ixith to exhibitor* and &gt;atrens and the report made by our secretary will show that the finances re in better shape than they have been for several years. The building - rowded and the board should aim each year, as fast as their finances will ermit, to increase their capacity. In the past tlr the board has sed all available moneys they could to accommodate the stock exhibit and might say somewhat to the detriment of other exhibitors, and I belie\ me has come when other exhibitors should receive a little attention. In le management of the fair there are two people that your board lave to cater to. oiie is the agricultural and stock men and the other BH &gt;atrons of the speed department. In the ) we appropriated a small K&gt;rtion of our funds and made what proved to be the fastest half-mile I n the country and the attractions given on the track were the best that the tate Fair ever had, and I think people went home well pleased with tl. tertainment.

The state fair grounds make a good mar - .11 expense when Malls can be had for the price asked in our prem - n list, and 1 trust the premium list committee will give this some attention. &gt;nd, I recommend that as soon aa possible additional acconin be provided for patrons who attend tl • enlarging the fimphitli •hat a new administration building be built and additional poultry, and additional water-ck -trueted. Third, I recommend that the Board of Mai instructed to have Superintendent of Ground*' oflice in the city of Lincoln for at least twi. ■is before the opening of the fair and five days after the closing of the Fourth, I recommend that ile of salaries be made for all elective officers, including the Board of Managers, as there has been no m:-. change made in salaries for some 14 years and which have met the reo,uirc - ago would not meet the requirements today. All of which is respectfully submitted C. H. RriKiE Lincoln, Neb.. Jan. lit, 1!KM Chairman Board Manager*.

Mr. Bassett: I would like to ask for a ruling of the president whether the appointment was to fill a vacancy, or is for more than one year or not. E resident: The office to be filled was for two years. I apply the same to it that would be applied in the election of officers in the state, that officer appointed fills the vacancy until the next general election, which Id be at this time. Mr. Mclntyre: In this connection, the list of names as read, comprise 14. whose terms expire at this meeting. The list last year comprised 15. original law in the premises named 28, 14 for each year. So this 15 matter, I don't know how that crept in there, unless it was the same 15 years ago— and I am speaking from memory, and that is not very good — but I think that at the time that Governor Furnas had been a member of the Board for 21 consecutive yeara we felt we would throw him a boquet, and we elected him an honorary member for life, and I suppose that is the way that number gets in there. He has been voted for and elected every two years. I don't know, the "honorary" part of it did not seem to wear only a couple of years. I simply call that up to show the shape we are in. K ember: I would like to inquire what the statute creating this Board d for? Mr. Mclntvre: 28. I Mr. Hervey: I beg leave to correct Mr. Mclntyre on that. The law ated the State Board of Agriculture in 1869 — without there were 29 ■sons named — you will find on the statute book under the law, as passed that time, the names of those 29. I have seen them, and there can be question about that, the original law. Secretarv Furnas: What vear. E ember: In 1869 the State Board of Agriculture was created. There a Territorial Board of Agriculture created in 1858, and that was in ex - ice until after Nebraska became a state in 1869. The State Board of culture was filled by the election of 29 members. Mr. Bassett: I will get the statutes. Er. Mdntyre: I want to apologize for my error in this matter. I am glad that Mr. Hervey has gone into this deeper than I had. I was king from hearsay, and supposed it was law. The following names were placed in nomination by the different members: Id. Mclntyre. . . . .Seward County. '. W. Hammond .Hamilton County. V. R.

Now my judgment is that I)n I'eters was lying, and that I am not so much of an old ; 'ie would have me believe, for certainly gentlemen of you know that for the last, I will not undertake to say how many but certainly ever since the year one. I have been responding t' dresses of welcome on the part of the farmers of this state. I been my pleasure to respond to addre- ■lcome from the I cellor of your University ever since I can remember, and it is getting to be something of a chestnut at our house, and it had gone on so long and so frequently that actually it seemed to me that the resemblance of the asso - ciations of people, the place and all must have led me into rep&lt; some of the ideas if not the language which I ha' m similar sions before.

It is only fair to the management and you and n hat I had or once come to think that it was safe for me to come down to Li: nd sit back in a chair in the rear and enjoy it without any thought of ailed on to say a word.

And when I recall what these gath' ■ 1 like, and what this audience of young men I ;ree with the Dean that Nebraska has certainly made grass, or I take it that this audience of young men mostly tonight represents le j&gt; itus of Nebraska agriculture. I take it that you represent ot only the brawn but the brain of Nebraska agricultural activities — that lose meetings in those days, comprising about a dozen men. sen ore than that, year after year, here and from over tin acquaintances and having quite a good time and getti nd some good out of it all.

We don't know for sure. I think it would be well to leave that matter with the Board of Managers. If he should find that it was necessary to have more help in order to carry out the wishes and the welfare of the Fair, let them submit that to the Board of Managers, and if they think i and they had the expense themselves instead of leaving it in the hands of the Secretary and perhaps hamper him in this If he has got to have more help why, he has got to take it out of the 1 1, which might not be sufficient compensation for this. ■etary Furnas: Perhaps I ought not to^say anything in this mutter but I feel that it is but just all around that I state these facts. The salary was fixed in every i .1 all the pay of the Secretary without any con - ion with him or suggestion on his part, twenty ye; .hen there n't one-fourth of the work to do that there is now. not a state in the I'nion that pu il compensation as does tska. and I think none of them do more work. This $2,000 was fixed originally as the salary of tl ay, and the Secretary was to bring in rits for extra service from time to time, and was referred to a com - e of which Mr. Mclntyre was chairman. Those sums amounted to *6(MJ to $800 a year for typewriting and for clerk hire that is neei the Fair, and for office rent, lights and fuel. Finally on the recom - .ition of committee.

I would like to ask the chairman of that :nittee what these reasons were? r?aident : Mr. Cook is asked as chairman of the committee for the re» - of the report. I Mr. Cook: Of course this matter came up before the committee and they &gt;k advice from a great many, and as we stated, there was some difference opinion. I might say just to enlighten the gentleman that the salary recommended by the committee would be $2,000 with additional expense clerk hire just immediately preceding the Fair and during the Fair, and expense of sending out printed in.r illy just t- I clerk hire and the . ■ Pair, leaving the $2. (MM) without that additional expense, d it was then thought by the committee that that would be about right ■"rdme to the judgment of a great mai retary Furnas: Allow me to say one other thing which I f' iow what appropriations have been made in support of the Secret office, that since I have been Secretary of this Board I have paid out than $6,000 out of my own private money. Three years I had no salary at all, and I have contributed $500 to $600, and a good many items, amount - ing to over $6,000. -are of itself even with the appro pria- • Mr. Cook: I neglected to speak of one thing. The idea of the comi in changing this was from this fact. We learned from sources that was creditable that this StiOO that was appropriated one year for the expense* was simply for that year alone; that the salary fixed for the Secretary was $2,600 and has never been changed. But one year when there was no Fair, and the Secretary, I believe, was acting without compensation on ac. of there being no income, theypassed a resolution of that kind that should be clerk hire and expense during that year of $600. Now w&gt; sidered that that was just for that year, and has been carried all along during these years, and construed that it was meant for all time instead of that If we are wrong about that it might I it h the recom - mendation* «f the commit Mr. Williams: I believe it is not wisdom for tlu~ Board to cripple the 'ary's office. He is our Fair maker to a great extent. Satisfied as I am that the office is well conducted and there is none employed in the without sufficient labor to keep them busy, therefore I think t) stage it would be very unwise to cripple the service of the office. Mr. Mount: It is the duty of the Secretary to execute and carry out the orders of the Board of Mana. w he is a forerunner of the Fair duty commences as soon as he is elected, right now for a year ahead will take it three or four months before the Fair comes on, there are premium lists to send out and p&lt; tnl out, which is no small task; it is a big undertaking. It is not a matter of sitting down in your office and thinking that over. You have &gt;;■ -&lt;-ute it.

Illinois and Wisconsin, all of which states furnish at tl of th. lice rooms for retary, fuel and lights that he has no expense with. There is not one of them that does not pay a considerable sum more for Secretary's salary than we are paying, and in some insi they pay more for clerk hire than we are paying our Secretary and the clerk. Gentlemen, are you ready for the Mr. Rudge: I wish to say in behalf of the recommendation that was made in rm i explain myself; that when this matter came before tin e last night. I was invited up before the committee; and in regard to the $60(1 paid the Secretary, I want to make it clear if I can, that the Board of Managers were not aware that we were paying this $600 until at t In of the last Fair. We have been doing it some two years, and I think I am safe in saying that the President didn't know that we were paying $600 a year. I am perfectly willing to pay $&lt;&gt;00 a year, but I believe it ought to be a matter of record, so that the Board of Managers will not be criticized in paying it. It ought to be a matter of record! The information spoken of came from a member of the Board, a great deal older member of the Board than myself, so that hi- inding in regard to the $600 came from a good source, and the rec it ion I made there was so that there would be an understanding, so that there would be no friction in regard to what we were paying and what we were not paying.

Mclntyre: Originally, going back to 1X00-1891, we'll turn back to it report for that year, you will see where that committee referred to came this matter that Mr. Kudge referred to. The committee recommended that time that an appropriation of $000 be set apart. The report failed suggest or say that it be paid out on voucher. That was the thought that availed in my mind at the time. I was late in getting in. but I am quite in ich with this. We don't want to cripple any ofticer of this Association, matter who is in, or what place he is filling. I got the impression that it s for this year. The Board of Managers could authorize the Secretary on suggestion, to meet any emergency. That was the impression that I got. hought that part of it was left in the discretion of the Board of Manag- I am glad to have this brought up, because there is nothing that kes any better feeling than these open discussions in this Board.

I thought that I would s have to do the speaking myself, but there is a better way out of it. I saw Mr. J. B. Dinsmore. and I knew I had the right man, go he will address you this morning. What he will say will be good. Mr. J. B. l)insmore: Mr. Chairman. Ladies and Gentlemen: I am &gt; opinion that the Chairman has made a mistake as to what way. I think he would have said much that would have pleased you t than what I would have; he would have said that which would have pleased you better. However, I will occupy your attention for a few mil!'. State Board of Agriculture, in session at this time, a.- re perhaps aware, is a state institution for the purpose of several thing-- thers the holding of an annual exhibition upon the Fair grounds as the state Fair. This is but really a small part of what we hope to do by reason of that exhibit. It is to bring together and present to the people of the state the better, I may say, the finished product of the hands of our agriculturists, our mechanics and those of hand-craft, that it may be compared by the people that come up with the every day home product that they see all about them. It is by this comparison that the finished product, the best we have with that which is .not so finished, that we are in li the farmers, the artisan and those of hand-work to keep on and strive to do better and make a fur - ther advancement. Last evening in this hall my attention was cali&gt; the fact of the improvements that are visible within the reach of I agriculturist in the state, within the reach of every person in the state. The addition of but one pound of flesh, the value of one pound of fl. weight of the chickens of this state will pay our public debt in a single year. I The addition of but one dozen of eggs to that as now being produced ns would more than three times pay the public debt of this state. These ings are within the reach of the farmer; they are within the reach of the lage resident. Those are little things, too little to attract our attention, and t in the aggregate they amount to a good deal. I things at we are overlooking day by day, that we of the State Hoard of A. re are endeavoring to attract your attention and cause you to stop and ink, and adopt better ways by which you will increase your own wealth d the wealth of the state, giving the people of the state, chance to have tter homes and enjoy better things that those of the older gener ■re deprived of. But if the young people who are now in the I'm 11 take up these thoughts and carry them out. work them out along the es which the State Board of Agriculture are trying to pre - ople year by year, and d t in one year but in a very few years, one of the most prosper' </seg>

You want to commence and work up your own pathway, up the hill of life, make your own homes, make your taste* and your own schedule of expenditures, but always try to keep them within the limits of the revenue derived. By doing this you will enjoy life much better, you will enjoy the privileges that you will otherwise be dej m will make the home content, you will bring up the children with the hope of a better life and better state and better home. Without the home in its fullest sense, the state is but an empty bubble, and therefore make the home what it should be.

Prof. : Suppose we call on Chancellor Andrews to give his experi - ence out on the Pacific Coast with some live stock meeting held out there. We would like to hear from him. Chancellor Andrews: I had the honor last week to attend the con\en - tion of the National Live Stock Association at Portland. By the courtesy *nd desire of the good of the commonwealth I went not only as one of the experts of the United States, but also as a delegate. I thought it was very funny I should be the only delegate to attend, myself personally, never par - ticipated in the ownership of any creature other than a fal calf which I lived to eat. Having some relation to a plain where there is a good deal of live stock, upon second thought I did not regard the situation as a funny one. I don't think the Pacific Coast is in it with Nebraskp-as far as climate is rned. I had the ague every day I was there because it rained. Very unpleasant weather when one is accustomed to Nebraska Weather. I was pleased to observe the respect which all the men n't that organization seemed, to have for this state. When any opinion from any one from this state was given it met with hearty applause, and there were references again and again to the live stock industry of the people who are in charge of it, and all of these were in the most respectful way. There were some of tin momentous questions of our times discussed in that convention. I am bound to say, and I said it all the while I was listening. I ■peaking in all my life anywhere — in congress, in state legislatures, in the Board of Agriculture, in a college or university, none that was the average of the speaking in that convention. Much of it was extraordinary, and some of it simply wonderful, and it was remarkable that although there were different views expressed, and each side was represented by the ablest talent that could be gathered in this country, how they all kept perfect their heads. One of the discussions was on the question of forest reservations, and one of the finest speakers 1 ever listened to, the present Governor of denounced that policy. His wit, satire, rhetoric and poetry were immense. There was a gentleman of some age from Montana, I think, who sat directly in front of me, and I observed the old gentleman, as this eloquent speaker went on with his eloquence against the policy that he was condemn - ing, shaking his head, as much as saying, you are all wrong. After he had </seg>
            <seg id="p066">69 included the head of the forestry department of the United States of merica replied, and in a few very simple statements, showed what the real lrpose of the government was. I think he demolished most of the areu - ents brought forward by the Governor's remarks rate whi came to be voted upon, it was clear that the convention ha&lt;! &gt;erfectly level-headed upon this all important theme. A* I started to hen the vote was taken and the resolution was passed, it was what I am ure the level-headed people of this country would have appro oubtedly some of these resolutions appeared in the daily papers, alt) have not seen any of them. When the report of this meeting is publ ou will observe that the resolution on that head was extrei that le representatives of this great industry, gathered from the four qu this great country, that they did not lose their hea r oratory. Another subject that was taken up and discussed, « the packers' trust, as it is called, and the feeling on the subjec altogether one sided in the convention. And yet, although the p ; , had not been represented at all, when the vote was taken and resolution was adopted it was surprising to see the tempers and the moderation of those gentlemen. Because they were all interested on the on&lt; knew somehow there must be something else on the other side. When the same general question of the transportation of li\ m the ailroads had been discussed there was for the most part 01 : and tat was that the rates at present were too high and the »r ■at trains containing live stock were transported over I ow a rate, and that care in general for this whole industry was not what it ught to be. There was no general denunciation. It was a very nod esolution, and was finally adopted, and with it as a part of i' reso - ution that representatives of the live stock a» ith as lany repr transcontinental leet with them and lay the situation before them in a pt way, &gt;efore any effort was made toward agitation. The most radical entlemen present wished to adopt was to go into every state and endeavor o have created what has already been created in the state of Texas, a state railway commission, elected by the people — not appointed l&gt; &gt;'rnor. ; was thought that this would pretty nearly cure al it that was not recommended by the convention when it came to nj; what should utter forth on t lii- question, but something more modern and easible. Another subject discussed was the creation of an independent pack enver or Kansas City or in Omaha, or perhaps or not very far out away rom Lincoln, and no doubt very considerable advance was made towards scheme like that. All these matters were debated over and again. ere debated by very able speakers on the floor and platform, and I was mpressed as never before by any convention. Some from aln ate in the Union, although of course the mountain and Pacific states were more largely represented than the states in the east. I think I never saw </seg>

No rash utterances of individuals has a right to go forth as representing the convention itself. I could not say to your State Board, with reference to the present condition of the k interests, that it was altogether the best. Conditions were not - were thought to l&gt;e too high. It was thought that a considerable part of the prices that live ought to bring to the raiser and marketer was being held back by the packer. Notwithstanding all this. I did not find any gentlemen who seemed to have any thought of selling out. They thought it was a good industry to engage in, and that light would break in Mpoa the present darkness, and naturally all holders of stock would do well to hang on to their stock. I was very sorry to be so nearly alone as the sole delegate of this state. On one or two occasions I wished to consult with a member, and I looked around and found it difficult to find even a single Nebraskan with whom to consult. I wish that the Rtate could have been represented vastly more largely. Every one in this convention has the greatest possible respect for the State of Nebraska. I was proud indeed more than once to be one of the several dairymen's representatives of the state in that convention and repre - sent you, rather that I could be there to speak up with the stockmen, even if other members of their delegation were not present. I ajii sure the mem - ben of the State Board will wait the published official proceedings of this meeting with a great deal of interest, and when that report comes you will read the addresses that were delivered there, and the debates that were had there, with even greater Inter iUI agreed that it was the best convention ever had, and all agreed that he voice of the association had not been sufficiently heard in the various incils of the land, it would certainly be so hereafter. I have to say in iclusion. it seemed to me that the proceedings in this meeting were the st admirable and eloquent of every thought T have ever observed any - ere. All proceedings of the convention were correct, the meetings began time. That is all this morning. (Applause.) [Here the work of the Board was resumed.] Mr. Mount: I feel sure we all feel better for going through the exercises which we have. Returning to the point which was under discussion in re - gard to the committee report I suggested that I did not like to reject the committee's report, and still I did not like to adopt it as it is now; and I suggest ed further that if there could not be a clause, something of that kind added after the item in relation to the salary of the Secretary, and that was That all expenses in relati' s office prior other than above his salary be submitted to the Board of Managers for their recom- </seg>

That would leave it all in the discretion of the Board of Managers to decide whether this expense si be made or not. I think something like that would cover that ground, and bring the expense within the Board of Managers so we would know what they were doing. The Secretary could anticipate a few weeks ahead what his expense would be in the next month. I know two or three months before the Fair there is a great deal to do and if you cripple his office you cripple the entire Fair. We should not for the paltry sum of a few hundred dollar* tie our hands. That is my sentiment. tMr. Mclntyre: I move to amend the report in this, that we set apart $600 ■ this purpose to be expended in tl f the Board of Managers we will all understand. That puts it back where it was before. Mr. Cook: I second the motion that Mr. Mclntyre has made, and I think that this convention will understand that this part of the report that was made by this eomm i-iniply to get this before this body in an ii gent motion. I Mr. Mount: If the committee is mind to adopt in the report or accept me other amendment without rejection You cannot amend a report; it not their report, nut if they are willing to adopt that, I am willing. President: Is there any objection on the part of the committee to the amendment offered by Mr. Mclntyre and accepted by the chairman of the committee. Hearing none are you ready for the amendment. Amendment adopted. The question now recurs upon the adoption of the report as amended. Mr. Mellor: There is another question in there. We already have a eneral superintendent on our list. I would suggest, and move you that tie words "General Superintendent" be changed to "Superintends Grounds." Now Mr. Cook says that is the way it • hat way. utieH of this person to be appointed are entirely at variance with those of 'General Superintendent." k President : If the chairman of the committee has the report, will he read it portion of it. Mr. — : I think that was probably copied wrong. The int*-: of this committee, as I understand it, was that it should be "Superintei of Grounds." Now if it is not that way and then' is no objection on the part of the committee, I should like to have the manuscript changed to meet that requirement. President: Is there any objection on the part of the association to the inmittee changing the wording of that report, if it is found to be worded wrong. Mr. Hudge: The only obj« • e to that, it is creating another office. Do we want to create anol i ' Now the General Superintend duties in the past two years, is what the Board have required of him. if we have a general Superintendent, is it necessary to have another Super - intendent.

            <seg id="p069">72 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. Secretary Furnas: I think the term "General Superintendent" would r it all. Mr. Mellor: The reason this matter was brought up in this manner was to relieve both the Secretary and Mr. Rudge; that is, relieve them of the duties that heretofore had partially been performed by them. It is almost necessary for the welfare of the Fair that a person should be here in Lincoln to allot space to implement men and grant concessions for different reasons. Mr. Rudge in the kindness of his heart has been doing this labor for the 1. and we have an idea that some man ought to do this labor because there is an enormous amount of correspondence connected with it. I think Mr. Cook will bear me out that his letter list as Superintendent of Machinery last year was something great. This letter list possibly would fall upon the duty of tl iry if he was here in Lincoln. Otherwise, it has been Mr. Rudge's duty as chairman of the Board to attend to this. Now the idea I think that the committee had was to relieve these two gentlemen, and irk for the best interest of this Fair Association, and we must either have this work done l&gt;y somebody that is already on the Board, or else we create an office. That is the reason that this recommendation is made. Mr. Mclntyre; I don't believe that it is good policy for this Board to create another office, as Mr. Mellor explains it. Mr. Mellor: You have got it mixed; the duties would not conflict at all. Mr. Mclntyre: I believe I would leave it to the incoming Board to fix it up. President: The chair may have got muddled in this discussion but as the chair understands it, the question now recurs on the adoption of the report as amended Those in favor of the report will say aye. Opposed, \dopted. Mr. Mount: I rise for information. Where are we at? President: We adopted the report as amended, providing that we set apart $6&lt;X) to be used by the Hoard of Managers as an amendment to the report. That is the report that we added to it. that is the amended report, but it carries that part with it. Mr. Rudge: I don't believe we understand what we are voting on. President: I will state it. The committee made their report which has been read here. The amendment is to appropriate S600 to be expended l&gt;y the Hoard of Management in their discretion to assist the Secretary. Mr. Rudge: Doesn't include anything but the Assistant Superintendent? President: This adopts their report in regard to that feature of it. There being no objection the chairman, with the consent of the committee, would have the right to change it if he had made a mistake in transcribing it. and with that understanding we will proceed.

If he has got 300 stalls and 350 applications, let him cut them down to meet the number of stalls he has. President: I wish to make a bald, bare-faced statement, that there are a great many who have found themselves without stalls, resident of Nebraska, who came two years without having rented a stall, then there were those who were crowded out by the large dairies. Mr. Bassett: Would it help matters by placing a limit? President: The question is llpon the adoption of the report of the com - mittee. Adopted. Mr. Bassett: On page 13 under the head of duties of President insert the following: "He shall appoint a Superintendent of Concessions at a salary of not to exceed $150, such Superintendent to give a guaranty bond of $1,000 to be paid for by the State Board. All contracts for concessions to be approved and signed by the President." I The concessions have been for years, and perhaps since we had conces - &gt;ns, under the control of the President. The custom has been to appoint Superintendent of Concessions who is to receive a per cent of the eonces - ins. And then it was in the interest of the Superintendent of Conn secure as many contracts upon that ground. I think there was $3,850 nd he received NM. And while the Board desires to reive as much money as possible out of the concessions, and yet the e INMOM we ask irred ii of that class we don't want, yet give us And in order to remove that entirely and this man might minister that office for a salary, they have proposed that he receive a larv instead of the per cent, and that it be solely under the control of the esident to sign a contract and that he ought to give a bond. Moved and seconded that the report be adopted !Mr. Rudge: I don't believe you will be able to secure such a man as you mt for $150. Now it looks like a pretty big thing, but you have got to go d get somebody outside of this Board, some man that will give it not only e month's time but two or three month's time. You will find people 11 want concessions all the summer long. I think this ought to be this iv, and I offer this as an amendment, that the salary of the Superintendent --ions be 10 per cent up to $200. but not to exceed $200. I say e salary should be $200 instead of $150. Mr. Mellor: I see no reason for limiting the percentage. We of course might get a good faithful man to perform these duties, but in case that he did not secure but $1,000 in concessions, we ought to have some incentive for him to work for the interest of this association. § President : It has been moved and seconded that the report of the tnmittee be adopted by inserting the words $200 in place of $I5i&gt; u ready for the amendment as amended.

Mr. Hendershot : I move to strike from our records this class altogether for this reason. Our national associations, most all of them, offer a consola - tion prize, and if we are not big enough in Nebraska to come out and stand up against the world, probably we had better stay at home. If we gat a creditable exhibit we can bring it, and if we don't get a place on the pro - gram as expert showmen we will certainly go to . tmove you as an amendment we strike out this premium and insert ad, make three places on our premium list for money and the fourth ! being highly commended. Mr. Russell : The State Swine Breeders' Association passed a resolution. tMr. Basset t: I saw your committee recommendations that we strike t rule 26 so far as it relates to swine, but not having heard from the cattle sheep men, we left it that way. Chairman: Was there a second to the amendment? A. Yes, sir. Mr. Filley: Mr. Hendershot is a professional breeder. I want to say to ■ou and this Hoard that we have got cattle in Nebraska and they are I ng up their herds, but they are afraid to come out against those farm herds lat come in here and clean up the platter, and we put that in and I came or the purpose to encourage and get our Nebraska bred animals in the ring, nd I want to nay to you that the means of bringing out my friend 1 ley come down here with as fine cattle as ever was shown on the ground, and now then there are other men back who want to come down here with leir cattle. If Mr. Hendershot prevails they will stay at home because ley will not come up against this big herd of cattle. In this amendment tat Mr. Bassett has just read, is that he shall elect when he makes his entry, nd when he brings his cattle on the grounds where he is going, whether against these professional fellows or against the Nebraska bred animals, oes not make any more expense. President: The report of the committee provides for the election of the expert, whether he shows in the open competition.or he shows in the Nebraska competition. The amendment of Mr. Hendershot that we strike out the clause entirely tends to make a third premium. Mr. Hervey of Douglas: I am opposed to the amendment of striking ut entirely this clause of Nebraska bred animals. I would like to see it o see knocked out because I contend that I am able to come into &gt;etition with the Nebraska breeders but not the outside breeders. But I would not take one of my cows and attempt to go into competition with one liese fellows show for the value of the cow.

The American visitor abroad is constantly reminded of the abundance of parks and botanical gardens in not only the larger cities l&gt;ut even in the small cities and towns.

It contains in the neighborhood of tiOO . me ]&gt;orti' it are heavily covered with trees and shrubs, others are sparsely covered with trees, and still other portions agaia consist of greensward without shrubs or trees. Here and there are often beds hihI masses of ornamental flowering plants. Walks and drives are provided at frequent intervals. In places the people are kept from walking upon the grass, while in other places :ire permitted to use the ground very freely. I saw boys and gj all ages playing as freely in this park as they do in the fields and public - in this country. Not far from this park is a smaller one. Regent's Park, nearly circular in shape, and containing about thirt This is considerably more ornamental, and apparently the public cannot u - ground M freely as in Hyde Park. St. James 1'ark and Green Park are two much smaller parks together aggregating perhaps one hundred acres. These are not far from Buckingham Palace, the residence of the King, and are 'ed in a very densely settled portion of the city. Here the child' all ages gambol about on the ground without any fear whatever from the police. In fact it seems that to a very large extent these London parks are for the benefit of the people. Ehen v r that there are here in the heart of London nearly or aps qflite 1.000 acres of land set apart for park purposes we may realise fully the people of that great city believe in open places for the benefit e women and children and t fie tired men.

How it has ipened that the real estate agent has been kept from laying hia grimy ids upon these open places is more than I can tell. These parks if sold building purposes would yield hundreds of millions of dollars, and yet sturdy Englishmen would resent most fiercely any attempt to restrict or uce their area. Eow add to these parks in the heart of the city the many parks in the irbs, Richmond Park. Wimbledon, Kew. C'hiswick, i aggregat - perhaps 2.500 to 3.000 acres, and we have i of what the great lish city has done for its people. But this is not all. In the suburb called Kew are the Royal Botanical Gardens, known the world over as the Kew Gardens. Here on an area aa large as a Nebraska farm are gathered all of the plants which can be made to grow under the care of the most skillful gardeners to be found in the king- Here in the great Arboretum one may walk through a forest which if not primeval is as dense and wild as the primeval forest itself. Here one may find trees brought from America, from distant parts of Europe, from Asia, from India, and^from Africa. Here are grown in profusion shrubs of all kinds from all climates, and here under glass where the temperature and the moisture conditions are made to imitate as closel bla the diff climates, may be found tens of thousands of species of trees and shrubs and herbaceous plants, all labelled and named so tluit ''he who runs may read." Here daily, thousands of people walk through the great grounds finding at once recreation and instruction. Who can measure the value of these great gardens to the people who live in London it - Add now to this the fact that from all parft of the world scientific men come to study the collections of plants which are brought together in the It is the Mecca of botanists the world over, and to this place r or later every systematic botanist must come in order to study the great treasures which for a century or two have been gathering in this place. |[n Berlin, the capital of Germany, an area of probably 500 acres is set de under the name of the "Thiergarten." and here again as in London ' people swarm day and night, walking through the paths under the shade the great trees, lingering by the beautiful shrubbery and admiring the at beds of fine flowering plants. Here are found at intervals, monuments, uid other architectural structures which commemorate the great &gt;ds of the German people, — a tribute to the feeling of patriotism which is prominent in the Fatherland. A mile away are the old botanical gardens. 1 in the densely built up portion of the city. Thirty or forty acre* of mnd are set apart here for trees and shrubs and plant-houses. Here I «r the great« ion of ca'tuses to be found any place in the world. 'hough the cactuses are American plants it is true that if one wishes to idy thoroughly these plants of America one can do so best by going to rlin and making use of this unrivalled collection of living, growing plants. t this old garden has proved to be entirely too small, and within the last t years at the little suburb of Pahlem on the southwest edge of the city I government has set apart about 150 acres of land, and here a new botani- </seg>

Here the government has erected fine office and laboratory buildings, and at the time of my visit the great plant-houses were just being enclosed. Wh^en the work is completed this will rival the Royal Gardens at Kew. - In Vienna, although the city is an ancient one, those in authority have seen to it that there are great areas left vacant for breathing places for the public. One afternoon I visited the great Prater Park on the edge of the three miles long and from one-third to a half a mile in width. Here are from 600 to 800 acres of land, some of it open, forming meadows on which the children play, some of it in very dense forests, some of it covered with shrubs. Some portions of it have been treated very carefully with the best derelopment of landscape effects, while others have been allowed to remain in as nearly as possible a natural state. I saw at least 50,000 people at the time of my visit, and as I looked over the great crowds that had flocked here for recreation and rest, I questioned whether the number was not double What a park of this kind means to the great city I have not time here to discuss. It means at least life and health and esjoyment for tens of thousands, yes hundreds of thousands, of women and children and tired men. Away across Central Europe into the land of the Czar is the old city of Moscow, the old captial city of all the Hussias. Here I found a botanical garden belonging to the Agricultural Institute which rivals anything to be found in America. The garden includes not only a great Arboretum in which trees from all parts of the temperate portions of the world are grown, but in addition, the garden proper, where plots of herbaceous plants repre - senting many of the botanical groups, are planted and carefully studied, -inection with this garden is a large farm with fine buildings and modern improvements. Both garden and farm seem to be maintained for the pur - pose of instructing the people. Visitors are welcome here and the object - leaaon which is before them cannot fail to be very beneficial to the farmers and the gardeners of this portion of Hu m go south across the great Steppes to the northern slopes of the Cau - casus Mountains. We leave the great cities of Europe and find ourselves in the region where there are only small cities, and towns of moderate size. We stop at Kislovodsk in the foothills on the northerly slope of the moun - tains. Here is a t#wn of about 6,000 inhabitants. It lies along the banks of the Kuma River which f ows down from the snowy summits of the moun - tains. Yet in this little city there is a fine old park, not situated as we might suppose, on the outskirts where the land is cheap, but in the very heart of the Here are perhaps 100 acres of land covered with trees most of which have been planted, and filled with paths and booths, public halls and play - grounds, and running through it is the roaring stream which adds greatly to the charm of the place. Here every night one may listen to the music furnished by one of the military bands. It is a cool, peaceful, restful place, and as one thinks that all this is in a little town in an out of the way corner of the world, he cannot help wishing that his own people in this enlightened land esteemed such things as highly as do these people. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">85 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. At Vladikavkaz, a city a little smaller than Lincoln, lying at the north end the great military road which crosses the mountains through Dariel Pass, found a city Lying on a level plain. The city was founded by one of the ormer rulers of Russia for the purpose of guarding this pass, and yet her* I ound that the principal street was in the form of a delightful avenue. Down le center of the street had been planted a double row of trees and between lese an elevated walk had been built. This walk is perhaps two feet a le level of the street on each side, and is twenty or twenty-five feet in * n a hot day one may imagine how pleasant it is to walk down this a nder the shade of the overhanging trees, and as th» n this becomes still more attractive. At frequent intervals K seats have been provided, and here the tired people come out and re - n hour or two every evening. Here the children play, running back and orth as children will. But this is not all. At the side of this same a* re the city gardens covering from fifty to sixty or seventy acres. &lt; &gt;ne en - rs these gardens as he would the private grounds &lt;&gt;f some wealthy owner this country, but after entering he finds himself in a shady park. The &gt;ortion of the park nearest the street has been act aside for the children, and lere are provided many games, swings, and similar things for their ei ent. This portion of the garden is always full of the voices and the chatter happy children. Further on are statues, and ponds, and fouir lere from time to time there are music and other means for enjoymCTit and ecreation. Remember that this is in a far away Russian city which was uilt not for beauty but through military if any place 1b le world, such things as parks and gardens might well be forgotten, but lere we found parks and gardens which are more attractive than any that I mow of in a city of equal size in this country. Now cross the great mountain range and in the dry and parched co': Transcaucasia, to the banks of the Kuril River, and the city of Tiflia. he rainfall here is not to exceed twenty inches a year and the soil is for the ost part very sandy, and yet in this city of about the size of Omaha are ound large parks for the benefit of the people. Alexander Park, eo\ perhaps twenty acres, lies in the heart of the city. All around it is the mstling. hurrying crowd of men _-ed in trade, and inside the park are trees, flowers, fountains, p&lt; tary. Here are grounds n which children may play. Here every nightftone may hear good music. ere are seats for tired people, here in fact are all the things that contribute o the enjoyment of people day and night. On the north aide of the city a new park has been recently laid out for the benefit of the inhabitants of that portion of the town. In connection with the new park are gardens for the acclimatization of plants and for other economic purposes. I know of nothing like this in any city in this country excepting New York and St. Louis. At the south end of the city are the Botanical Gardens of Tiflis. Here are gathered trees and shrubs and flowers as well as rare plants, including palms and ferns and bamboos. While open to the public under certain restrictions, this is not intended as a public park in the ordinary same, yet those who </seg>

Perhaps ten to fifteen thousand different es of plants are grown out of doors on these interesting grounds. Then ! are plant-houses, libraries, and collections of preserved botanical srial. I was very much su/prised at the magnitude of the work which under way in this botanical garden, and yet it must be remembered that is all in connection with a city no larger than our own metropolis of ha. 1 further south 100 miles or more, on the plains of Southern Armenia, under the shadow of Mt. Ararat, is the little city of Erivan containing about 30,000 people. It lies on the hot and dusty plains in the immediate vicinity of the great mountain. The rainfall is probably not to exceed ten inches a year. On the edge of the city runs the river Zenga which flows from a mountain lake, Lake Gokschai, many miles northeastward. Nothing will grow here except under irrigation. The land is a dry and parched one, and yet in this city of Armenians, Turks, Grusians. and other non-European types, and in the center of the business portion, a park of considerable dimen- It is true that it was not as beautiful a park as many that were .1, but a park in a region of but ten inches of rainfall cannot rival the parks in London; yet here was valuable land set aside for this purpose. Around the park were gathered the hotels and the larger business houses. ugn the park there ran the irrigating ditches and here were provided walks and seats in abundance, and at night electric lights and music, and here the people at the end of hot days gathered to talk, to chat, to walk up and down, and to listen to the music. Hatum, a city of 30.000 people, lying at'the east end of the Black Sea. and until twenty-five years ago a Turkish city, we found another park which might well be envied by any American city of equal size. Although so recently wrested from the Turk, the city has made much progress in the de - neiit of its parks. We found one portion to include many trees which td not yet seen, and these trees are not confined to the region alone. ■ und many American trees growing luxuriantly in the parks, showing that the managers were men of education and broad training, and here too we found to our delight a botanical garden with hundreds of trees both Dative and foreign all named in such plain way that the ordinary visitor might gain much valuable information in regard to them.

Further down the coast in the suburbs of the city we found a iiyv of parks, and here to our delight, we found also a botaniral garden where he government under the direction of the University is introducing large numbers of foreign plants, and labelling them so that those who visit the ;rounds may be instructed as well as amused. I need go no further in my illustrations. What I have said of the par hese cities has been simply to bring the matter before you in order to em - &gt;hasize the fact that in the cities abroad the making of parks and gardens s looked upon as one of the necessary things in every city. In America we ought to imitate this good habit. It is true that in this country our argest cities have parks, but to a verv great extent they are situated in the uburbs alone, and the very people who should have the opportunr getting to them, never reach them, and our smaller cities generally ha &gt;arks at all. and when we come to our towns and villages what can we say? There are no places for the children and the women and the tired peo - )le generally. Coming now to our own city of Lincoln, a city which has many I about it which arc very attractr made to drop his head that we have no parks. It is true that four blocks of land, between I) and F and 6th and Kth streets were originally set apart and labelled ' 'City Park," but this is scarcely more than a "common." for here cattle and horses and swine are permitted to roam at large, For years this has been a repr to the city. All that is good in it we owe to the private efforts of the ! spirited women of the city, and yet year by year their efforts have bee* largely negatived by the utter lack of public spirit shown by our officials. This little tract of land was not fitted by nature for park purposes, an. it has been made less useful by its absolute neglect. We must preach a reformation. It is not to our credit that this city has no breathing place in it. We must have not one alone, but several public grounds where children may play, where people may gather, when may sit and rest in the cool of the e\enings of the hot days of sur Why can we 1. de in the Antelope Valley a tract of land on which we may erect a proper Lincoln Park worthy of our city.' Such a park \&gt; ntral. such a park could be visited by the great majority of the p&lt; of the citv. Is it not worth our while to consider matters of this kindf Finally, is it too much to hope that within a short time the T*ni\' may establish a botanical garden where may be gathered all of the i. plants of the state, all of the plants which may be made to grow in region, where every plant grown shall be labelled M that the visitor as he passes through the garden may learn not only the name but the hist, the plant as well. Such a garden may be a place of beauty and of interest and at the same time it may have a high educational value for the p&lt; of the state. </seg>

Without a fertile soil, and with - out a soil capable of producing large yields, well bred crops and well bred tock are practically useless. There are certain reasi-ns why the j«ct of soil fertility is of peculiar interest to Nebraska. One reason is be - cause we have here a soil that is practically new. a soil that has not been de - pleted or sufficiently depleted so that it will be difficult to bring it back to a state of high productiveness. It ia still in a condition where it is possible, with a comparatively small outlay of time and money to keep it in a per - fect crop-producing condition.

We are fortunate this evening in having with us some one who has made a deep study of this matt - fact, whose investigations along the line of soil production, are becoming I have the pleasure of introducing to you this evening Prof. C. G. Hop - kins of the University &lt;&gt;f Illinois, who will address you on THE PEHMANKNT MAINTENANCE OF THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY &lt;)K THE SOIL. Prof. C. G. Hopkins: Ladies and Gentlemen: If there is any one thing which farmers know better than anything else, I think it is that there are inferences in soils. All soils are not alike; they do not have the same pro - uctive power. We all recognize that there are different physical condr n soils, Some have better drainage facilities than oth- are hard nd compact and almost impervious to plant roots, while others are loose nd friable and more readily penetrated. But we recognize still further, hat a given soil may be highly productive in its virgin state, and in later ears, after half a century of cropping, we note that its productive capacity t very markedly reduced. We ail recognize these conditions. But vident that such conditions were also recognized 4,000 years ago. At the ime when Lot separated from Abraham, you remember that Lot chose be well watered plain, and Abraham took what was left. Lot recognised he fertility of the soil, and I am free to say that during my early life on the arm, I don't believe that I knew anything more about the fertility of the soil than Lot and Abraham knew. I just simply raised crops. Perhaps I used better tools in cultivating, but I went on plowing the ground and sowed he seed and took what came, just as my father and grandfather had done &gt;efore me. And I believe we are doing that yet here in the great Central We do not recognize such a thing as plant food, certainly not as much as that subject deserves. I have here a chart which shows th« quanti - ies of certain elements of plant food contained in a number of the import - nt farm crops It is well known that there are 10 essential elements required to grow crops. And in my talk this evening. I shall assume that I am talking to tebraska farmers and not simply to the University men who are here at .incoln; and I shall assume that you have not spent very many years in tudying the chemistry of the soil any more than I did when I lived on the arm for more than 20 years. So if I stop to explain what I mean by an element or any other terms that it may be necessary to use, I hope those hat are familiar with these things will pardon me; for there are those lere who have studied this subject for years. By the term element, we mean a substance which can not be divided into two different things. I can illustrate perhaps as well by the ear of corn as with anything. We take an ear of corn and we can readily divide it into grain and cob. That tells us at once that the ear of corn is not an ele- </seg>

There we- have four different things from the kernel corn. Consequently that in not an element. We can take one of these terials. that we get from the grain, say. carbohydrates, and we divide into starches, sugars, as glucose, dextrose, gums, pentosans and »tanc«. insider one of these materials we get from carbohyii :arch is one of the carbohydrates. We can divide starch into carbon and hyd and oxygen, consequently starch is not an element. Hut now we are at nd of our process of dividing. Carbon and hydrogen and oxygen are elements. We know that carbon, for example, is an clement, because we cannot take carbon and divide it into two things. We cannot take hyd and divide that into two different things. That is impossible. That is what is meant bv an element. Now there are ten elements required for growing crops. Three of them — these three that I have mentioned — carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, ar. plied by nature in abundance. The element carbon comes from the ■ sphere, where it is present in the form of a compound called carbon dioxid. 'hat may be rather a new term to some people, but it is really a simple I think you would know exactly what it i&gt; simply from the I carbon dioxid. You know there is an element carbon and an element oxygen, and then you know what the compound is, because "di" simply means two, and you see there is the complete name carbon dioxid. It is a compound of the two elements and contains one part of carbon and two • f oxygen, and this is the simplest name we can use for it. This element carbon is contained in the carbon dioxid in the air ir. the form of gas I want to take just a moment to explain how th ible. We ■ of the element carbon here. It is a Mack solid substance in its commonest form, and it is not very easy perhaps to discover or understand how this material can be in the air, in the form of colorless gas. bu' if you take this element carbon, which is well represented by chap ordinary coal is nearly all carbon if you take that and lieut it to a high temperature it begins to glow and it finally disappears.

Mere \\ t another element, sulphur, a yellow solid substance. Now, there fen elements, carbon and sulphur, with which you are very familiar. W change both of them to gaseous forms if we let them unite with the o* in the air. This sulphur unites with two parts of oxygen, and yoi, know at once what the name should be of the compound thus formed: namely, sulphur dioxid. These two elements, carbon and sulphur, unr with the other and make a compound, and that compound any one ought to be able to name just from the names of the elements- The compound of sulphur and carbon is carbon disulfid, and contains one atom of carbon and .Iphur.

You throw in 25 pounds of coal and fiO poun xygen enters the vent and about So pounds of the gas. carbon di ■iff through the chimney.

The plants absorb hydrogen id oxygen through the roots and carbon and oxygen through their leaves, id thus we supply to the plants these three elements. They make up ) to N per cent of the total dry weight of ordinary agricultural plant*. hese three elements make up !»() to M per cent of every ton of hay or "hey differ somewhat in different crops; they make up a large prop&lt;' every crop. There are four other elements which do not need much consider.! One is sulphur which I have spoken of. Another is iron, and the other two are calcium and magnesium. We do not need to consider those elements because they are required by plants in very small amounts, and they are ut in nearly all soils in comparatively large quantities. There is : ably enough iron in the ordinary Nebraska soil to grow several hui thousand maximum crops of grain. We do not need to worry abn .. The plants require a mere trace of it, and there are tons of it available. \\ e cannot conceive of its ever becoming deficient in the soil. I Hut there are three other elements to which we ought to give attention. d these are those to which I refer in the tabular statements — nil osphorus. and potassium. This matter of feeding plants is simpler than feeding live stock. Then* three elements are present in nearly all soils in limited amounts, but are required by agricultural plants in very considerable quantities V we put these two facts together you will see that if we remove crops after vear. we keep removing these elements, and if we have a limited - to draw from, ultimately oui I cannot give the growing crops enough of to grow maxi crops, and then our crop yields begin to be reduced. Just how much of these different elements we should have in th&gt; we do not know absolutely as yet. We know that they are present in soils n a form which is not very soluble, and we know we cannot get all of ut in one season, indeed we liberate only a rather small per cent und&gt; &gt;eBt cultivation we can give. I have estimated roughly that we c.v ut 2 per cent of the nitrogen in plowed soil in one .season. I think tha tape is rather high, but if we could do that; that is if we could take ■ •lit every year from the original amount, about .50 years would U 11. Of the other elements, phosphorus and potassium, we cannot get them </seg>

You will see from the tabular statements that there is not enough of some elements in these soils to grow 100 crops. I want to take a moment's time to speak of one of the elements in •omewhat greater detail. The element of nitrogen, one of these two ele - ments which is a gas, it is contained in the air, and we get it from the air by means of leguminous crops, such as alfalfa. I do not have any nitrogen to show you and hardly need to do that perhaps. It is present with us all the time. Four-fifths of the atmosphere is nitrogen. The crops cannot use this element, nitrogen, in the free state, any more than they can the element carbon in the free state. We must change solid carbon to the form of gas before plants ran use it. 80 the element of nitrogen, which is a gas in the free state must be changed to the form of a soluble compound. The element phosphorus also cannot be used in the free state, it must unite with other elements before plants can take it up, and that is also true with the element potassium. Each one of these elements is essential to plant growth, as the piston rod is to the movement of a railway locomotive. You may have a locomotive that is all complete, but you leave off the piston rod and there is no movement; the train stands still. And so it is just as essential to plant growth that the plant should have every one of these elen otherwise it does not grow. This element, potassium, in the 1 iaa metallic substance, somewhat like lead (the xptmker shoved I Ait it. it gives a bright surface. Plants cannot use it in this state. It must l&gt;e united with other elen If we were to put this in theroots of the plants it would instantly d&lt; them, indeed it would take fire in a moment, because it has such an attm for other elements, especially for the oxygen and hydrogen in water. If I drop this piece in the glass of water here, it will immediately take fire, uniting with the hydrogen and oxygen contained in the water, and forming a pound with those two elements. (The experiment was performed). Here we have the transformation of an element from the free state over to the form of a compound. Now, I put in quite a piece of that substance, but it is gone, you see — destroyed apparently, it has really united with the hydrogen and oxygen. Potassium united with hydrogen and oxygen/ You know what it ought to be called. It is potassium hydroid. We get enough of the names of all of these elements to show what it is — what elements it con - tains. There are so few of these elements that we use in daily life that we can know about them. !(Here the speaker performed some experiments for a few minutes with lerent elements.

Now, we who have lived in Nebraska, and had interest enough in le state for the lust 25 years, know that up to a very recent period it has ways invariably been the case, that every appropriation that has been sought for from our legislature, especially for the school of agriculture, has lad to be drummed up by the regents, the chancellor and the faculty here the State University. I have been utterly surprised at the seeming in - ifference on the part of the rank and file of the farmers of this state to tere.sts in educational matters. Now as one of the incoming regents, nd especially as the only farmer regent on the board. I anticipate that in uture years the farmers of this state are not only going to know more about ur school, but they are going to be more interested in it, and I tope that from this time on the farmers will see to it that the work of get jpropriations from our legislature for o'ur school of agriculture in pa - ar, will not devolve so heavily as it has in the past on the chancellor an acuity of the University. I believe we ought to make it our business from lis time on to see that our legislators are elected on these issues, and that e get more nearly what we are entitled to in the way of appropriations or our school of agriculture. I wish that the farmers of tiiis state could take a trip over into Minnesota and Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin, and look and see what the farmers there are doing in the way of agricultural education.

I think you have had illustrations of tt your own neighborhood and among your own friends, that the best talkers are not always the l&gt;est workers, and sometimes the other way. Perhaps when I am through you will think that I may be a good worker, but you are quite certain I am not a good talker and cannot hold an audience.

Hoard. Another Henry ('. Adams, who is now a most able Represent in Congress from our district —one who is working all the time to advance agriculture. Now Adams delights in telling this story on Hoard and my - self. He says that on one occasion we all three went out in tl to hold a meeting with the farmers. We arrived at the hall in due and at once proceeded to occupy the platform. — all three of us. — and to talk. He affirms that Hoard talked and talked for about an hour and a half, and then it came Henry's turn; that Henry got up and talked and talked, p on the floor occupvving the middle of the room. Adams declares, sat one lone man. and tl 1 and Henry both did all their talking to that one man. Adams atfir 'opped to catch my breath, after a long .-ound, the lone man in the audience spoke up. saying. "I about through/ ' I said. 'We are." He replied. "Well I hope so, for 1 am the janitor, and I would like to lock up and go home." I hardly expect to hear from the janitor tonight, but perhaps before I am through you all will have left the room to the janitor and myself. Let me tell you first of all, farmers and students, something concerning the origin of our agricultural colleges. The man to whom of all other agricultural college movement is to be credited, was Justin S. Monill. of Vermont. While in the Lower House of Crag '-cured the passage of an net in 1858 by which the general government set aside a large area of the public lands for the nt and maintenance of indu leges. For reasons which I cannot I to explain but which ■ duca - tional. James Buchanan, then President, vetoed this measure. Mr. M &lt;&gt;t satisfied with this set-back but started again, and finally, wfc the higher house of Cong red, in lMi:J. the passage of a new nu. for the same great purpose. Abraham Lincoln signed the bill Ju^ by which this great government gave away over eleven millions acres of land for founding what we now call our agricultural colleges. By this meas - ure thirty thousand acres of land were granted for each representative that any state or territory had in Congress. The little state of Delaware, with its two senators and one representative, received ninety thousand acres of land. The great state of New York with its thirty-three sentatives, received nine hundred and ninety thousand acres. Up to this time there were no strong scientific institutions anywhere in America. Harvard College had no scientific department nor did Yale. In his great speech, which is a classic Mr Morrill said, among other things, that i their wealth the rich I; rofessioaal </seg>
            <seg id="p093">96 for those who wished to enter the professions of the ministry, law and medicine, but nowhere were there schools for the education of the children of the industrial classes, who must themselves work with their hands as well as their heads. He argued that the perpetuity of this government waa not safe under such a one-sided system of education. He pleaded that since the rich had provided for the professions and left the industrial people without education, that the government fill the breach, and so the Morrill Act of 1862 was passed, and thereby came into existence the greatest indus - trial colleges and universities in the world. The Boston Institute of Tech - nology, the great Cornell 1 . and all our state universities were mightily strengthened and advanced by this effort. The first departments to be developed in these industrial schools were those of the sciences, such as chemistry, physios, botany, etc. Close after came the various departments of engineering. The good accomplished in these lines is beyond measure. We hear much today of the rapid strides that agriculture is making in all of the lines of applied science; our great factories and machine shops are in evidence. This marvelous advance has been brought about through these industrial colleges founded on the Morrill Act. Thousands of young men are studying th* sciences and the various branches of engineering in these great institutions, and these trained young men passing into all the fields of manufacturing enterprise, become the real power in these institu - tions. With trained heads uaui trained hands they are able to plan.to devise and invent as no other class of men could do. Our great manufacturing plants, our railroad corporations, our municipal advances, are largely brought about by this class of men. By the Morrill Act the educational trend of America was turned aside from the old days and pushed into new lines. Yale and Harvard were forced to put in scientific schools. Men came to realise that an education did not consist necessarily in studying Latin, Greek, mental and moral philosophy, with a smattering of mathematics and a tinge of popular science. The great good of the Morrill Act permeates c branch of our educational effort and is finally reaching into the public schools themselves, where the sciences are taught in an elementary way, and manual training is becoming a factor of prime importance. But agricultural education dragged in these institutions. There were few students and less call for instruction. Nor was it to be wondered at in those days. I'ncle Sam was giving away his land and begging the people to come and take it. Out here in Nebraska a man could have 160 acres of land for merely living upon it a short time; in fact he usually got the land that he set his heart on whether he lived on it or not. If he grew tired of hia possession, if grasshoppers threatened his happiness, all he had to do waa to pull up and move on. The white-topped wagon was much in evici Why should a man send his son to an agricultural college to learn about farming when he could gain possession of a quarter section of God's richest earth for the asking? The early efforts to secure teachers of agriculture were amusing if it were not so serious. College presidents and professors of languages thought they knew how to teach the young farmer.

One does not have to eacher of Greek and Latin to have friends in these days. Any line of agri - ulture is interesting to a vast number of people, and wherever you men — in the banks, in the cars, on the streets — you will find them talking apiculture and interested in agriculture. The banker, the railroad pre - he merchant, either owns a farm or longs to possess one. The agricultural eacher is eagerly sought out by these men for conference and the advice le may give. Another point I wish to make is that the classics and even the mathe - matics and many of the other studies, offer little oppertunity for young men of from fair to excellent ability. These subjects have been v. over and over by highly trained men for centuries until it is almost impossi - ble for one to make a discovery or to do anything which will improve or put them into a better or more useful form for mankind. Indeed, yount seem to realize this and teachers as well, if we may judge from the manner in which the classics are now taught. A short time since while riding on a train from the East to my home I fell in with a Princeton student who told me that he was in his senior year. He said that he was pursuing classical studies, as they all do at Princeton, but regretted the fact. I expressed surprise and inquired the reason. He stated that although he was perhaps the average of his class in ability, after all he did not really understand Latin and Greek, and believed they would be of MUM to him after leaving college. He declared that over ninety per cent of the members of his class used "trots". I a -urprise at this and asked him what a "trot" was. I think a good many students sitting before me this evening have perhaps ridden "trots" and need no introduction. To the farmers present I will say that a "trot" or "pony" is an English translation of a book printed in a foreign language. Some of these books have a line of Latin or Greek. for example, under which is a line of Knglish. telling just what the words above mean. Such a book is an interlinear translation; such a book you see is easy. This young man told me that practically all the students in Prince - ton used literal translations in getting out their Latin and Greek lessons, that the students explained away the use of "trots" by saying thai could not afford to spend over an hour on a lesson, and that they, could not work out in the old-fashioned way in any such time. think of this, farmers and students. Think of young men spending four years in college nominally studying Latin and Greek and using trans - lations all the time, and going to the class-room, sitting in front of their professors, all pretending to be students of the classics. Think how same teachers, if they | to-night lecturing to you. would descant upon the beauties of the classics, how they would tell you that no man was really educated or cultured until he had been thoroughly drilled and could read in the original tongue the words of the immortals.

Let me illustrate by taking horticulture and flora - culture as an example of the great possibilities before us. Out in the beauti - ful Santa Rosa Valley in California there lives a man who is working woi in plant life. I refer to Luther Burbank of Santa Rom. A short time ago it was my pleasure to visit this man. who li o nature, and to na' May I tell you something of his work and what he has accomplished? He was a poor boy working in a cotton factory, in Massachusets. but then he was a close student of plant life. Running across a field of po' one day he noticed a couple of potato balls, the fruits, which you know, resemble a small green tomato, they were a surprise to him. for t! of potatoes, the Early Rose, is not a bearer of fruits as a rule. 1 stick down by the plant to mark it and watched when the fruits should ripen. One day when he went to inspect his treasure it was gone. Hi about on his hands and knees he found the precious fru as we call them, saved the seed from them, planted them, tended the tiny 512288U </seg>

Mr. Burbank could have m:ule much money had hi tinued strictly on bush: but he was too deep a student of nature and loved plants too well to think only of money making. I wish I take you to his garden and show you his creations — perhaps you have seen some of them, for they are now being scattered all about the world. The ladies will recall that the ralla lily, beautiful as it is, h fragrance Mr. Burbank has produced a calla lily the size of a silver dollar, rich in fragrance. Take the gladiolus, you know that the blossoms appear one or two at a time on the rhacis, beginning below and blossoming upward on the stem. Mr. Burbank has made the gladiolus blossomTill at once. The ox-eye daisy as we know it, is a flower a I ■ r than a silver qu dollar. Mr. Burbank has produced from this plant the Shasta d.i beautiful blossom three or four inches across. One of these have sulphur yellow petals. He has produced a white blackberry. He I the strawberry and raspberry, producing a new plant. He has crossed the apricot and plum and produced the "plumcot." He has crossed the lol plant and the petunia, one of our garden flowers, nnd produced a new genus called "Nicotunia." He has produced a plum that contains no pit what - ever. As 1 went about the grounds where Luther Burbank is UMIJII his deep studies and reaching his marvelous results with plants, and I witnessed his marvelous love for nature and his insight to her my&gt;' it seemed to me that this seer had walked with God and learned his lesson from the Throne itself. Compare Luther Burbank's work with that of one grubbing away at Greek roots. At one time the Greek language was a prolific source of results, but it holds out little hopes to students to-d b«r« and there iis Bpeeia I honor real Greek my other students, but the | f opportunity I in the classics. but along agricultural II as many of tlie other urge upon the young men 1 me that they despise not U 4 agriculture.

I ask you. young men. is th« hance for all your energies in studying Indian eon H satisfied simply plow the ground and plant it and cultivate the crop as ather did? Is there not in this one plant .something to keep you interested 1 your life and bring you a competence along with happiness?

The young corn plants m ar more attractive to you than ever before, and there will be happiness nd joy in their cultivation. At harvest time there will be a larger nd ten times more interest in it than ever before, and all becaus. lave begun to see and appreciate the wonders of this plant, whirl leretofore have grown year after year with scarcely a thought as I onders and beauties. Latin and Greek sink into insignificance in the i many a young man when compared with the possibilities that lie all &gt;out him along agricultural lines. Strange, is it not, that in this country e never begun to think nruch about Indian corn until we were prod er two billion bushels of that wonderful grain annually.

A new line of pedagogical Milt's to us and our colleges are more and more prepared to teach pr:i hings that at the same time possess the highest scientific inti • Before 1 close I wish to tell you something of Denmark and its woi ful agriculture. Think of Denmark as covering one-fifth the area ka. Denmark has much poor soil along its western sidt — a lot of sand no better than some you huve in Nebraska. On an area of one-fifth the siie of your state she supports 2.2OO.OO0 people. Now do not forget in considering what I huve to .-ay hereafter 1 alty. keeping an army of son i lo as her neit! and "keep in the swim." Denmark has no iron mines, no coal mines, and her forests are not worth mentioning. The land has been cultivated from time immemorial. In Denmark you can walk over fields that \&gt; farmed when Christ was on earth. In spite of the seeming great difTii Denmark is prospering agriculturally. Forty years ago Danish butter was of a poor, miserable grade. Then the government took up the matter and agricultural colleges were established, one of which is the fine at Copenhagen. 1 were sent to Kngland to - the English market, and the government gathering th </seg>

The farmers entered into co-operation and the milk of many farms was made into batter at one central point the benefit of your Legislature ! ne length one effort which Ihe Danish government fosters in aid of improved butter. At the agricultural college near Copenhagen is a ref signed for the purpose. The professor in char) iphs or \n &lt; certain day to some forty odd creameries for each to .send in a tub of butter by first express. The butterniaker has no chance to put up an extra fine article but must take from his cooler that which he has on hand. The pack - age goes by first express to Copenhagen, where the forty odd packages are u the cooling room. Three ex] m, run their triers into the butter, examine it and score it. This is repeated by two more •ets of experts until nine have examined the butter. By this time the packages are bored pretty full of holes. A dealer takes away the butter under contract, disposes of if, paying a certain price the A few days later another lot of tubs is received and examined in the same way. To pay the expenses of the expert, the shipping charges on the butter and the losses sustained on the operation the Dainsh government pays out about $10. (XX) a year. Denmark covers one-fifth of the area of Nebraska I would like to ask your most worthy Professor Haecker, who is here this .ng, if the great state of Nebraska is allowing him $10,000 a year for ■udy of butter. Now this is only one of the ways in which Denmark has fostered her dairy ii nd she has kept it up for many years past. What is the result of her efforts? Denmark exjnjrt- &gt;r over $"J." 000 worth of butter — and her area is one-fifth that of Nebraska. Hut Denmark was not mg the greatest butter producing region of the world. She has other strings to her bow. Having much - milk and whey from the factories, the Danish people undertook to pn a high quality of bacon. 1 ; I found out by study that it was useless to try to compete with Nebraska. Iowa and Illinois in producing lard hogs, for here corn is cheap. In her efforts to produce high quality baoon experts were sent to Ireland to see how bacon hogs were fed and how bacon products were prepared and put on the markets. Feeding i ments were conducted by the agricultural college. In these feeding ' ts over $50,000 were spent — and Denmark has one-fifth the area of iska. I would like to ask Professor Kurnett how many thousand dollars Nebraska has given him for &lt;periments? What are the results of all this energy and outlay of money? Little Denmark — one - fifth as big as Nebraska, with a population of 2,300,000 people — exports about $15,000,000 worth of pork products, mostly bacon, each year. But I have not told you of all Denmark's efforts in advancing agriculture. The hen has proved her great worth here in Nebraska, but she has - more wonderful things over in Denmark. In the I'nited State* we produce lo&amp; of eggs in April. May and June, but even then we do n&lt;&gt;  - many. I am eating eggs at my home this winter that cost three each, and they are not very "fresh" although often fully "ripe". What is the value, do you suppose, of our egg exports from this great and glorious </seg>

You will never regret it. Members of the legis - lature, I urge you to appropriate money freely to your Agricultural College. Regard the dollars you put into it as money invested that will bring one hundred per cent a year returns. That may be usury but it is a kind of your people can stand. I have been delighted in observing the charac - ter and bearing of the hundreds of men, young and old, I have seen here ■ting the meetings out at the Agricultural College. I observe how straight they stand and how they walk, as if they owned the earth. since I heard a man say he was "only a farmer". Out here you are proud to be called a "farmer." In some places in this country a man will talk about "going into business." Perhaps you even have a few who will go into Lincoln or some other town in Nebraska and start a peanut-stand or a grocery with a stock of goods representing about $700 investment, and then strut about talking to people about "going into business." If that is "going into business" what in the name of common sense is about owning and operating one hundred and sixty acres or a larger territi i»ka's splendid soil? Who, after all, is the business man. the peanut the dealer in plug tobacco and canned goods, or the man who raises Rp of corn, breeds pure-bred animals and lives like a prince on his i domain? ieof the young men in this school hold their heads high because they are in the law college. Perhaps you have two or three hundred of them. What would happen to Nebraska if you should ship every one of these out of the state when they were graduated from your University? Would aska be much poorer and would the people hold a day of fasting and r when they left you? Supposing some one were to telegraph Chan - cellor Andrews that he wanted a carload of lawyers. How long would it take him to fill the order? If you cannot fill it in Nebraska. I can easily from Wisconsin, for we have in every town young men well trained in the law, well meaning fellows, too. who have made the mistake of going into an overcrowded profession. When word comes to Professor Burnett that a well-trained young man is wanted for some line of agriculture, how many has he on hand to fill the order with? At the Wisconsin Agri - cultural College we have many calls for such men that we cannot supply, mm unity in this broad agricultural land needs well trained young men to help on its agriculture in the breeding of pure-bred live stock, in the improvement of corn, in making country life desirable and lifting it to a higher standard — in a thousand ways these young men are needed. Agj-iculture College is the leading source of supply. It is adding dignity to agriculture as a profession, and the legislature, thoughtful citizens and advancement generally cannot do too much to help it on in its splendid work. My friends what I have said tonight was in the endeavor to show that agriculture is really a great vocation worthy of the ambition of the :ipn. That all about us on the farm nature spreads her choic - easures for our benefit. We must train our minds and open our eyes </seg>

ADDRESS BT PROF. JOHN HAMILTON. I At. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Before announcing tin &gt;n which I am to speak, I desire to express the surprise and gratifi .t I feel in seeing the large attendance of your representative farmers at i convention. I have had scyne opportunities for becoming acquainted h what is going on throughout the country in the matter of Dm nt of the interests of agriculture, and I think it can be truthfully said it there has been no time in the history of our country when there has mi as great interest manifested among intelligent men of all classes in ■ development of this industry as then As 1 fr&lt; te I find that their best men, the best citizenship of 1 • es are ake to the importaaea of agriculture as a part of the 1 ■ • the country, and are earnestly striving to advance its intei ; such meetings as this and participating in the discussion* that aria*. !Some weeks ago I received an invitation to address an association of ricultural students of your University, mid supposed that it consisted a club of a dozen or perhaps twenty agricultural students in attend the college. You can imagine my astonishment to find a hull filled 0 of your young men, 200 of them members of the agricultural c &gt;ur University and the others visiting students who had completed t urse in agriculture in p;i and who are now out upon rnis putting into practice the teachings which they here received. This the finest sight that I have seen in all my tra\ Through the courtesy of the officers who have charge of the program u which these meetings are being held, I have been permitted to i own topic for discussion to-night. After thinkin. that might be of interest to you. I ha&gt; i as my topic the Farmers' Intsttutes to our National Svstem of Education. As you know, my duties are in connection with the Fan work of the United States. At its last session. Congress created i: office of Experiment Stations of the Department of Agriculture at Wash - ington, the position of Farmers' Institute Specialist. The purpose in ing the office was to equip the Department for rendering a.- - those who are engaged in the farmers' institute work through States. The Department of Agriculture for some years has realized that the farmers' institutes would unquestionably "become an important I &gt;• of the National system of agricultural education, and that it was imp&lt; that this department which has been taking the lead in other directions in agricultural improvemen dly in agricultural education, </seg>
            <seg id="p103">106 should likewise take part in aiding the states in developing this new field farmers' institute work." The rapid deterioration of the farm lands of the eastern and southern states that has been occurring ever since the settlement of the country, became at length so apparent that our legislature became alarmed lest the impoverishment of the soil should reach such a stage as would compel farm - ing people to abandon their living and move to the towns and cities in order to subsist. That this fear was not altogether ill-founded is evident from conditions that exist throughout many of the New England States, and in the tobacco, cotton and corn districts of the South. Thousands upon thousands of acres in these sections have become almost sterile, and great areas once in full cultivation and producing abundant harvests are now o grow up in brush and briars, or tg be washed away by floods that become more and more destructive as the vegetable mutter that once held in place is lost. are all familiar with the history of the nations that abandoned agricul - ture for city life, and left ,the farms to slaves to occupy and till. One f»te befell them all — the destruction of their agriculture, and the conse- I overthrow of the Stale. Our statesmen as well as our most thought - ful and patriotic citizens have always realized that the first duty of those who desire to perpetuate the Hepublii ihat the agricultural interests are protected and that the conditions of life out on the lands are made such as will be in all respei ■• le, and farming be sufficiently remunerative to make it possible for the owner to earn a livelihood for himself and family, secure a competence within the usual period &lt;&gt;f active life, and do so with - out impoverishing the soil. Previous to our occupying this continent Umighty had been storing fertility in the&gt;e lands for thousands of years. Our ancestors and ourselves have been engeagd in skimming the i from American soil, in endeavoring to abstract fertility from our farms as rapidly as possible, selling it off year after year until, as I have stated, in many districts the lands are now scarcely worth the value of annual tax. {; was not until 1802 that anything definite or general was done to afrest deterioration. When at length Congress undertook to legislate in the rests of the agriculture of the country, it acted upon the broad princi - that the only permanent way to improve an industry is by improving men who control its operations. The way, therefore, to improve agri - ure they agreed, was to apply this principle to that industry, and first rove the men in charge of each individual farm. Anything short of would prove ineffectual, and be but a temporary nostrum whose benefits Jd be evaneseent-'and of little permanent worth. Education unquestionably must be the means by which agriculture must be improved and be secured against the destructive practices that have hitherto prevailed. Congress, accordingly, by act of July 2, 1862, donated public lands for i and Representative in Congress from the several states, 30,000 a&gt; h, to be sold and the interest of the proceeds to be applied to the support of at least one college in each state </seg>
            <seg id="p104">107 NEBRASKA - I Ut BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. Iose chief object shall be to teach such branches of learning aa are related agriculture and the mechanic arts. About sixty colleges of the character yours in whose halls we are met to-night, are under the provisions of this It was expected that young men from the country would flock to these institutions by the thousands for the information and training which the land grant colleges would furnish, and that immediately there would be a great revival in agriculture throughout the United States, that the country districts would speedily be filled with educated young men who would follow agriculture as a profession and who would at once arrest the deterioration thut had been going on during the century that preceded the enactment of that law. To the astonishment and great chagrin of the friends of these new institutions, it was found that comparatively few of the j men of the country were taking advantage of the opportunity which the land grant act provided. There seemed to be but little demand for agri - cultural education on the part of those who entered these institutions and very few were found taking the agricultural course. The instruct' these colleges also discovered that there was very little reliable agricultural information to be had that would be of value to the classes that they were expected to teach. For twenty-five years these colleges were compelled to grope their way, vainly searching for some form of curriculum that would be satisfactory and for some method of instruction that would prove effec - tive in class-room work. The friends of these institutions at length concluded that before the col - leges could possibly do the work for which they had been founded, it would be necessary to provide means for the securing of information that would be reliable and at the same time be of direct value to agriculture. Congress was again called upon to solve a second great problem in agri - ultural education. Accordingly after carefully considering the entire ques - on, Congress passed in 1887 an act providing for the establishing of agncul - ural experiment stations in the several states, whose duty it should be I and experiment in order to discover the truths of science as ley relate to agriculture. These stations were required to collate their results rom time to time, to publish them in bulletin form, and distribute them or the use of farmers. It is from the time of the establishment of these ations that the improvement of our agriculture dates. It is these in ons that have given the impetus to agriculture that we see exhibited 'erywhere, and that is responsible for the great assembly met in this hall, Ed the active interest that is manifested 'here to-night. Sixty of these itions are now at work, officered by a force of over 700 men and women gaged in the discovery of truth for the benefit of agriculture. The oldest these institutions has had but sixteen years of life, and in that brief period riculture has been revolutionized, has become a science, and is now nked with the learned professions. In this period a large amount of lit era - re, valuable for farmers, has been secured by these station men. The iiling list of their publications now numbers about 500,000 names.

In the same year in which the land grant colleges were established, indeed in the same month of that year and on succeeding days. Congress took a small and inconspicuous company of nine persons out of the Depart njent of the Interior and formed them into what was thereafter to be known as the Department of Agriculture of the United States. The appropriation for the entire work of this new department was $60. (HK) for that year. This band of men has grown until last year there were connected with the depart - ment 4,200 men and women, over l,(tO&lt;) of whom are scientists or scientific assistants all giving their entire attention to the discovery of scientific truth relating to agriculture, and publishing the results of their investiga - in bulletins for the use of farmers.

The average farmer docs not read, and there is perhaps a reason why this is true. He may even have been a student in his youth, but the ph exercise required to conduct a farm obliges him to be out early in the i ing and continue work until late at night, so that after the exertion of such a day the tired farmer taking up a bulletin or agricultural report finds himself unable to give it his attention and naturally and almost inevitably falls asleep. During the season of active farm work from early spring until late in the autumn there is but little time to read, and then as- winter comes and the long evenings, when time might be had, the man has lost the reading habit until as year after year of this routine continues we find the average farmer contenting himself with the country paper and the morning and evening chapters read at family prayer. The reading habit, like the church-going habit, is easily and rapidly lost. Omit going to church for six months, and the inclination to go, in a great degree, disappears. Omit reading for a year, or two, or three, and this habit will likewise lose its hold and the effect to master the contents of a book becomes a burden which few will voluntarily undertake.

It has come to take the information of which I have spoken that is now lying dormant, and for the distribution of which no adequate means has yet been found, has come to carry it out to the farming people at their homes. The institute employs men for this service who have informed themselves with regard to some one or more of the difficult problems with which agriculture has to deal, men who read, and sends them out to who either have lost the reading habit, or never acquired it, and stands them up before such farmers in institute assemblies, and has them tell what sci - has done to help agriculture and agricultural people in the prosecu - tion of this art, and then these lecturers are required to submit to a cross - nation by those who have questions to propose or desire additional information, in order to make clear that which they have tried to present. I he institute aims to send these teachers into every hamlet, and requires a to carry to the most remote sections the information which the farm - need. Last year institutes were held in every state in the Union except - three, and in even- territory except Alaska, Porto Rico and Indian and over 900,000 farming people attended these institute meet - . The teaching force engaged by the state directors, outside of ons as were assisting the local or county managers, numbered 924. And now. Mr. Pesident. I wish to speak for a little upon the relation which the land grant colleges organized by the National Government in 1862, and the experiment stations, and the National Department of Agri - culture, bear to the Farmers' Institute of the United States. What is the relation of these three great institutions to this our most modern agricul - tural school? It seems to me that these institutions in their relation to the farmers' institutes can be separated into two distinct classes. In the first is the agricultural or land grant college, established under the act of 1862. In the second are the experiment stations and the National Department agriculture at Washington. The first class of institutions were organized to teach agriculture and the mechanic arts. For this they were endowed, and for the accomplish - of these ends the funds received should be applied. It was a low posi - tion v ions occupied forty years ago. I know something of th&lt; having been associated with one in another state since 1865, and well remember when these colleges were sneered at as being the con - ception of men of 4ow ideals in education, and their students were regarded as inferior in educational accomplishments to the graduates of the classical institutions of that time. I am thankful that we have lived to see the day when all of these old classi - cal colleges have had not only to accord a place to industrial education, but have also been compelled to readjust their courses of study to correspond with those which the land grant colleges were first to formulate and introduce. The land grant colleges have risen from their humble beginning in 1862 to a first place in the education of to-day, and are rightly now regarded as the leaders in scientific thought and progress everywhere throughout the United States. They have in their faculties something over 3,000 teachers, and in their class rooms about 50,000 students, and yet more than one-half of </seg>

Manifestly that of the brethern or members of one great faculty whose work lies along lines that lead to practically a single end. namely, the elevation of farming people by met tion in the several arts and sciences embraced by their profession. In of expanding these institutions in dil iway from agriculture, here is work for all time to come in strict, accord with t he spirit of the endow ived. and in a direction in thing has been attempted on any high grade plane by educational institutions </seg>

The method of distributing this information by means of the printed page has been found to be at best exceedingly slow, and in. other respects has failed in adaptability to the conditions which exist among farming people, read the bulletins and consequently the information which they contain is not generally disseminated and most of the beneficial results hoped to have been accomplished by this means have not been realized. To these institutions the Farmers' Institutes have come as valuable allies in their work. They come as distributing agents to take this information and carry it out to the practical farmer and explain to him the methods by which the principles that have been discovered can be applied in the prose - cution of his art. In order that the lecturers themselves might be thoroughly informed as o what the experiment stations and the National Department of Agricul - ure have in their possession that is likely to he of use to the farming people, ach experiment station director in the I'nited States was requested to Mud ■ f his publications to the 924 lecturers of the country, and to supply ach with such bulletins of information as they may issue from time to time I the interest of agriculture. The National Department at Washington ■as also sent lists of its publications to these institute teachers, and now II are regularly receiving these documents from both of these sources of agricultural knowledge. It will, therefore, soon be inexcusable for any nstitute lecturer not to be thoroughly posted upon his specialty, or to fail o be an authority upon at least one subject in agricultural science. Lest, however, the impression should be left that the colleges and stations have been indifferent to the institute movement, I wish to state that last year 196 agricultural college and experiment station men suspended their teaching work in these institutions, and gave 1,666 days of their tii giving instruction in Farmers' Institutes. In twenty-one states of the I the entire control of the institute work is in the hands of the officers of these institutions. Is it any wonder that with such a force of capable teachers a great move - lent in behalf of agriculture has set in. and is now in full tide, ad van c - ng the interests of this industry everywhere throughout the land? Can ou wonder that thousands upon thousands are attending these institutes bat they may get the information that these teachers have to impart* s it surprising that men are coming up to the meetings such as this at which you are gathered, paying railroad fare, living at hotels for days, losing ime that is much needed by their business at home, counting that the out - ay is fully justified because of the valuable information which such meet - ngs always supply? The possibilities that lie before the agricultural people of the United States </seg>
            <seg id="p111">114 are very great. A slight increase in production of the land now under till - age would add enormously to our wealth. We exported during the year •tided June 30, 1902, $1.3.50.000:000 worth of products to other land&gt; this S851.000.000 were agricultural products. After feeding 80.000,000 of people here at home as no other nation has been fed, and after furnishing forage and grain for the millions of cattle scattered over the hills and val - f the I/nited States, we were able to spare $851,000,000 worth of sur - plus to go to feed the hungry in other lands. I estimate that if only a slight advance were made to the low average which we now produce, as $5 the value of each cow. $10.00 to each horse, 50 cents to every sheep. 30 egg* to every chicken, 4 bushels per acre to our present rrop of wheat. 9 bushels per acre to our crop of grain, and to other animals and crops in like moderate proportion, there would be for export of agricultural products of the S85 1.000 .000 of a year ago over $1,400 .000. 000 more, all going t p profits that the American farmer would receive in a single year. That such an increase in production is not beyoud the range of possibility kingly shown by an experiment conducted in my native state by e\ - -nor Hoard of Wisconsin. A creamery having fifty patrons was near Montrose. Twenty-five of those who patronized the creamen a dairy paper, and twenty-five did not. An accurate record was kept for a year of the products of each dairy with the following results: The readers of a dairy paper averaged for the year per cow $53.23; the non-readers &gt;eed $32.95 per cow, a difference of $17. 2S. The readers fed per cow during the year $35.15 worth of feed. The non-readers fed per cow during the year $32.29. The readers received as profit for each cow $15. OH per year, the non-readers a profit of fifi cents per cow per year. If a little information will effect such a great improvement in a community in a single year, what might we not expect if the great mass of information that now exists were placed in the hands of the 30.000.000 farming people of the United States, not simply for a single year, but year after year ■ new discoveries of science become known. The Farmers' Institute can. in the hands of the colleges, and the stations, and the Department of Agricul - ture at Washington, become their most valuable instrument for the spread of the information which they are annually securing, and its force of teachers should be numbered by the thousands, instea ; he hundreds as at present, and their efficiency be continually increased, until the entire agri - cultural population become thoroughly aroused to an appreciation of the great opportunities that education, agricultural education, brings to the ♦Mm of the soil.

I have in my orchard one block of 1,200 apple trees. It is on the rolling prairie. There is a canyon or draw running through it in such a way that part of it is protected from and part exposed to the winds and storms, that may come from any direction. When I planted the trees I told the that were helping me, that we would see which kind of soil and slope was the best to plant an orchard. The hills sloped in all directions. We had trees down in the canyons and we had trees on side hills and on top. results are that the trees in the bottom of the canyon winter killed, those on the top have made a slower growth. Those on the edges of the canyon and side hills on the clay soil made a good healthy growth and are loaded apples every year. The apples hang on until matured, while those 01 of the hills, the apples begin to drop with the blossom and keep dropping ail summer. By the time they are ripe there are not many left and what are, are small and poor quality, that is the winter varieties. The summer apples that ripen in July and August hang on and ripen fairly well. In planting an orchard care should be taken to plant a. winter varieties on the lowest ground. The low ground holds the mo longer. The late apples have a better chance to mature. The apricot does the best on the clay soil. I know of two orchards that are planted on clay soil. The apricot trees are full every year with fine fruit while those that are planted on that black loam scarcely ever bear any fruit, peach does the best on top and side hills.

It is of no use to me for anything else," he replied. So it is with many that have planted orchards and have had failures. They planted their orchards where they should have planted corn or alfalfa. When planting an orchard the wind break is one of the things that must not be forgotten. The trees - be protected from winds, especially when in bloom. If the tree is exposed the wind the pollen will be blown off before it is ripe and ready to fall on the flowers to fertilize them. A tree that stands out by itself, exposed the wind, may bloom every year and scarcely ever have any fruit oi The pollen is blown off before it is matured. Some yeare you will find the fruit all on one side of the trees in the orchard where they are exposed to the wind.

Mr. Chairman and Fellow-Stockmen: Having handled sheep in Nebraska for thirty years it seems natural that I should be called upon to rela' iences. However, sometimes I feel that I am "talked out" on the subject; that I have nothing new to offer that might be of benefit or interest to my patient listeners. I Before telling you what little I know about sheep feeding permit mr congratulate you upon the- ive and profitaV&gt;le meetingK ■n and farmers which have been so successfully inaugurated by &lt; Itural Experiment Stations of our University. Nebraska I believe i* ate in the Union whose wealth rests entirely upon the product - e farm and range. We have »o mines or oil wells (some of us may have xk in them to our sorrow) no resources but those of agriculture and It is therefore no more than proper and right that we should offrr the Ix-st of opportunities to get a thorough knowledge of these indus - tries, and our Experimental Station is certainly doing a grand work in teach - ing our young men the science of agriculture. We have shown the world some of the results of our work by taking the champiortfchip prize with our steer "Challenger" who was graduated, so to speak, at our Experimental Station, and whose mounted hide will be looked upon with pardonable pride by every Nebraskan visiting the Exposition, where I expect him to be the centerpiece of our exhibit. I How fortunate the boys of this advanced age are! When I was a ck in Russia we had no Experimental Stations where we could be taught e lessons of soil study, of balanced rations, of rotation of crops and a hund - i other things which the up-to-date farmer of this century has to know. ■ithiT had we the little book on itary Agriculture" wh'u ichers, Professors Bessey, Bruner and Swezey have so ably compiled, </seg>

In ' when I came to Nebraska, even the eastern p of the state was but sparsely settled, and large flocks of sheep wen for their wool mainly. The range was still free, and we felt as if we owned the land, and did not even have to pay taxes. These conditions soon changed. The range was cut up into farms, the virgin soil was broken up and planted II, and the keeping of large bands of sheep became impracticable then commenced to fatten our surplus sheep for the market and soon found it to be a fairly remunerative business, if carried on properly and conserva- n bands of feeders were trailed from the ranges of the far western states and territories to Nebraska, and fattened upon our cheap corn and hay. During the eighties the business developed very rapidly, but remained in the hands of comparatively few large feeders, who annually had from ten to thirty thousand head of sheep in their feed lots, and who bought their corn and hay, until some seasons there were over one million head • d for market in our state. Since then the business has undergone another evolution and to-day we find more men engaged in it with smaller flocks, farmers, who raise their own corn and hay and who use the sheep as a medium to market their grain and to enrich their land by the means of the "golden hoof." It seems entirely right and proper that this should be the case. In this branch, as well as all others pertaining to far: k raising and feed - ing, the spirit of the times points to more inter scientific pursuits, on a smaller scale. The farmer who wants to buy one or two, or even half a dozen carloads of sheep for the above purpose had best get them at our local market, the South Omaha StoVk Yards where, during the fall f feeder sheep from the West are quite heavy. If he is a judge of sheep it will pay him to spend a few re, and select his purchases himself. He should then see that the sheep are thoroughly dipped before taking them out. If he has no ex - perience he had better employ the services of a reliable commission house, one, which makes the handling of sheep a specialty. Those of us who still follow the business on a larger scale sometimes find it profitable to buy our feeders on the range and to ship them direct to our feed lots. Thanks to the efforts of the efficient head of our Bureau of Animal Industry at Washington, I)r, Solomon, and his able assi - "scabbies" or "scab" as we commonly call it, the bane of the sheep feeder, is very nearly under control in the west, and I believe a few more yean of strict enforcement of the present rigid sanitary rules will entirely eradicate it. Whether shipped in from the range or the stock yards your sheep will be _-aunt. hungry and tired when they arrix e at their destination. We always try firet to fill them up on stubble fields or prairie grass, before giving them any grain. If you put them into the yards at once, give them all the </seg>

For years each fall we have had several bands help us do the corn husk - ing, with very good success. I like (■ r than the usual two-legged corn huskers for the reason that they dn not strike, and hey board themselves. The past fall was especially fine for herding in the cornfields. We had one band of over 4,000 head, which one man on his pony, with his well - trained dog handled successfully from the 17th day of October until just before Christmas ; they are fat now. The main point in feeding corn that way. is to never let your sheep get hungry; keep them in the corn all the time, and you will have but few to hang on your fence. We always sow rape in our cornfields, and find it a very desirable adjunct to the dry corn and stalks. Of course these sheep were given a full ration of grain at once when finally put into the feed lots. Where it is not found desirable to herd them and the sheep are put d into the yards you have to get them into their grain gradually. I like to start them on oats, if possible, or oats and corn mixed half and half. As we all know, oats are an almost naturally balanced ration but they are also the highest priced grain, pound for pound. IBran is a very good substitute for oats, and at the present price, $11 per l, as cheap as corn. In about thirty days you should have your sheep, if they are strong wethers, eat about a pound and a half of grain per day, and that is about all they will stand for any length of time. If ground oil cake is not too high, say S25 per ton, two or three ounces of it per sheep per day will be a paying investment. My favorite ration would be two thirds shelled corn, one third oats with an addition of either t p cake or bran, or, if possible, both. I suppose your learned professors would call that a fairly well balanced ration.

As a fundamental principal, corn breeders recognize that every corn plant has an individuality which corresponds to the individuality of animals. Probably few agricultural plants offer such advantages for improvr ceding as the corn plant. The individual plant is of sufficient size to be easily distinguished and the general characteristics of the plant are readily observed; as for example, the height and diameter of the stalk, the number and size and position of the ear of the stalk, the length and strength of the ear shank, the size and shape of the ear. and the amount and quality of the The fact that the different grains of corn on a given ear are markedly uniform in composition and in their ability to produce plants similar to </seg>

Thus, a single kernel of corn in a single season under orable conditions will very commonly produce an ear bearing a thousand neb usually amounting to at least three-fourths of a pound of corn in ight. No one will doubt or question this and yet if three thousand kernels all planted and are equally prolific, we have a million kernels or at st 10 bushels of corn, at the end of the second year. At this rate in three years' time from a single seed we have ten thousand bushels of corn. And at this same rate in four years' time we have ten million bushels from a single seed. Again, at this same rate, and in only five years' time, from a single seed we have ten billion bushels of. corn, which is four times the annual con of the United States and four times as much corn as would be required to plant the entire area of the globe But, you will say that this is impossible. Of course, it is impossible on poor soil, with poor care, with poor seed, or during poor season ; but is it impossible to grow a thousand ker - nels of corn from a single grain, and is it impossible that under favorable conditions each one of those thousand kerm produce an equally large increase? If not, then this computation may serve to illustrate the possibilities of reproduction in corn under ideal condition. Columbus reported that the Indians grew corn with 700 kernels on the ear, four hun - dred years ago. But we may reduce the size of the ear to 500 kernels and still we find the reproduction power of the corn almost incredible. t)ne af the possible disadvantages in corn for breeding purposes, a&gt; ed with some other plants and with animals, 1 the corn plant and the consequent inability of the breeder ninthly the male parent, but this disadvantage is very largely sreome by placing the breeding plot in an isolated spot far ran tn other corn; or, what is nearly as satisfactory and usually .cticable, by surrounding the breeding pi orn of practically : same breeding, and then destroying or detasseling all apparently imper - t plants.

El the seed for the multiplying plot must come from the best yielding rows the breeding plot, this seed being second only to the fifty most perfect s which are each year selected for the next year's breeding plot. In general this is the method of corn breeding which is followed. We may breed corn only to increase the yield of grain, or we may also breed for many other purposes; to improve the physical characterist : the ear, so far as we know what are desirable physical char act. increase or decrease the height or size of the stalk ; to raise or lower the ear in the stalk; to improve the composition of the grain by increasing or de - creasing the protein, oil or carbohydrates, as may be desired. No sooner had the Illinois Experiment Station worked out the method and demonstrated absolutely (although on a small scale) that the marked improvement of corn by breeding is possible, than the Illinois Seed Breeders' Association (and more recently several other similar associations) took up the work, and they are rapidly demonstrating that the bre&gt; of corn is practicable and profitable on a very large scale. The individuality of the seed ear becomes apparent when one field row yields 50 bushels per acre and another adjoining row planted from a difT seed ear but on the same kind of soil, produces 120 bushels per acre differences are not unusual in breeding plots.

Similarly we have tried to change the oil content in two lots of what was originally the same kind of corn, increasing the oil in the one and decreasing it in the other.

BKINNER, INDIANA EXPERIMENT STATION, BEFORE NEBRASKA STATE SWINE BREEDERS' AS8OCI &gt; En discussing so broad a topic as the one assigned to me, limited time Ices it necessary to only hint at many of the important features of this Stable Industry. . ■To begin with, success. with hogs will be just in proportion to a man's '&gt;n to little details and his business ability. Breeding and raising hogs just as much a business as banking or any other commercial enterprise. I The successful hog men o are big broad-minded men full of ish and enterprise, moreo are enthu idents of their busi - ss. There is no place for a man in this work unless he is willing to give it ime and put much hard work into it. It is not the most pleasant task to sit up all night with a sow, but it is frequently necessary. For the man who likes the business and is willing to put time and energy into it there is no other live stock business any more profitable and pleasant. The profit is good with quick returns. The producer of pure-bred hogs is interested in three important things, the breed, the individual and the pedigree. At the outset I may say that all modern breeds are good, all have a place, no one has a monopoly of all the points and the man who goes into the breeding business should be ■ ned in his choice of breed by his surroundings, the trade or market </seg>
            <seg id="p132">135 demands and opportunities for sales along with his personal likes or dislikes. It may be that the location in regard to others will determine or help deter - mine the choice. Frequently a community of breeders will be an advantage in selling. In - it may be better for the beginner to take up a different breed from that found on neighboring farms and thus take advan- tage of the opportunity. I One need only look over the hogs that appear in any of our large markets order to be convinced that there is great need for more careful sel - parent stock in case of market hogs. Other evidences of the neglect of is most important matter are to be found in the small litters, lack of sise, ne, etc. Pure bred hog men give much more attention to the work of lection than men who are producing for the market, but too little att' given the matter by both breeders. They have ignored essential into to the detriment of the breeds. In selecting breeding stock, one of the first and essential considerations is the breeding. It is important alike to all classes of breeders. The knowledge of the breeding and an&lt; ling herd enables one to tell to a reasonable degree of certainty what the offspring will be. Furthermor. prolificacy of the herd may be influenced by selecting breeding stock from such strains as have proved to be of value in this respect. It is well to select animals whose ancestors have good breeding and feeding qualities, and in the case of the pure-bred herd, they should come from noted families and strains that have achieved su&lt;&lt; • 1 sale rings. These have int merit and sell more readily to breeders. While pedigree and breeding are important features in the selection of breeding stock, individual merit should be kept in mind. Too many are in - clined to buy pedigrees without anything back of them. Having considered breed and breeding, one should decide on the type of hog he desires to breed and then pay particular attention to the form and quality of his animals. The most profitable type will be one which has, along with good breeding quality, plenty of bone, good size, and at the same time, quality and early maturity. The females should be of good size, have good lines, have a straight and slightly arched back, short, broad head, large deep heart well sprung rib, strong back and loin, with large deep hams and standing on feet, and strong legs of medium length. Some will prefer young sows and others old. On this point successful men differ. Much depei. conditions. Where one is producing pork for the market young sows may be most profitable if properly mated with a mature male. On the other hand, a tried sow is usually to be depended on, and the breeder of pure breeds will not give her up until she has begun to go backward. The breeding of j and immature animals is likely to lead to undesirable results, such as lack of size, lessened vigor, impaired breeding and feeding qual Having selected the found portant to breed so the pig - come as near the same time as possible, as uniformity means much, b&lt; feeding and on the market.

Some think the light horse, such as used for 'bus and B88 purposes, better adapted to farmers' conditions, but in his eff&lt; uce the heavy type a sufficient number of failures will result in enough ie lighter type to supply the demands.

Thus it is observed that the range steer, though produced in ol becomes one of the strong. ment commercial factors in business. The extent to which the range steer is felt in his commercial importance cannot be approximately figured. safe however to say that so extensive and important has become the beef supply of the United States, that the destruction of our range cattle industry, (where more than one-half of the steer cattle of the entire coun - e produced), would at once create a beef panic throughout the mar - kets of the world. Since the range steer has become so closely allied to nercial interests, any influence that will operate against the suc - cessful prosecution of this industry, reverts to the detriment of the whole ■&gt;try. COMMERCIAL ORCHARDING Eiia old subject has been discussed so many times that I hardly deem Ivisable at this time to go into details as to the preparation of the soil, ting, cultivation and care of the orchard, but take a brief look at the lition of orcharding in this country and see where we are at. Ehen, in consulting government reports, we note the large number of apple planted in these west-central states in comparison with the small of fruit, we at first wonder why, but we readily see that this is due, largely, to a great per cent of the trees being under bearing age. The yield and quality is materially reduced by the depredations of the codling moth, apple scab, etc., which are allowed to develop unmolested and even aided to a great extent by rubbish and filth which is allowed to accumulate in the poorly attended orchards, which furnish breeding places and shelter for apple enemies. Then, further, the rough and tumble way in which the ap - ples are picked and put on the market does cap the climax and complete the year's job in our Nebraska orchards. However, I firmly believe this type of orcharding has seen its best days; that it will never again perch on that lofty pinnacle of satisfaction that it has in the past. The time has come when the orchard must be looked after as carefully as other parts of the farm. The </seg>

E'et we all point to the hog as the great mortgage lifter, and ju - all understand that in order to succeed he must have the above car* attention. The orchard has been too much of a secondary matter.

The lazy man despaii ng an orchard because it requires the expenditure of too much time and mm he will grow grain, potatoes, etc., as a matter of The ne of waiting ten or twelve years for good returns is reaping a crop each year from the balance of his farm. Thus we can readily Me that it is only the patient, tree-loving person, who studies his orchard and gives it needed attention the same as other parts of his farm, who will attain the highest degree of success. I believe the appearance of the orchard plague will prove a benefit to the good orchardists because he will get a bet - ter price for his first-class product, thus getting large returns for good, intelli - gent labor, and letting the sluggard reap as he sows. He who wishes to grow apples for market and yet does not care to be continually bothered with marketing them, should plant the entire orchard to only a few varieties Then when a variety is ready to pick he will have enough worth while, and the large buyer will seek him instead of him being compelled to seek market. i Winter varieties are preferable for such a grower as they are not so perish - le and can be sold more readily in large quantities.

I feel some hesitancy in presenting a subject to you that 1 o not think of interest at this stage of Nebraska farming. I he courtesy through which I have been placed first upon I program of themes appealing to you so strongly that you are Ein spite of the injection of this theme. Eere I not sure the introduction of the silo upon Nebraska farms would 1 the conservation of vast wealth that you are now producing, I should to my feeling, that you are averse to having this krout barrel of the i patch farmers urged upon. Prof. Smith, in introducing his theme of the balanced ration yesterday, cited the consternation that would arise among stockmen were one ani - mal out of each four fattened for market to be swept away by disease, said he, the equivalent of that is going on upon the vast majority of braska farms through failure to produce that fourth animal because feeds are not properly combined. I believe what he said is true, that the coun- iat large is losing 25 per cent of its feed through lack of knowledge as ow to use it to best advantage. Just here I want to congratulate you upon having a man at your agri - cultural school with such clear insight into the feeders' problems and ability to work out the product that challenges the world. E'he first fad upon which the claim of th- (deration ed, is that in addition to the 25 per cent loss to which Prof. Smith ha* ed your attention, a proportion of your great crop variously estimated rom 33$ to 50 per cent is scarcely being fed at all. You say it is not worth the handling. But you are thinking of the time when prairie hay could be had for the cutting, when land values did figure in the cost of feeds, and when the corn crop had to be harvestt the primitive way known to the American Indian. But those condition* have all passed, but passed indeed so recently and so rapidly that you have hardly been able to adjust yourselves to the new conditions. I he new realization which above all others my visit to your state has ressed upon me is that there is no longer any ' ' West," v nam - h stores of the ages are man's simply for the gathering.

To this I reply that I think our average in the rn part of your state, moreover, that the silo is not confined to our ler dairy farms, but is in use by some of our largest cattle feeders. True, our farmers do not have as large a proportion of their land in corn as do you, but they do not need to when they utilise all they do grow. A man with whom I have been ai^ nee coming among you and who has traveled much over jrofl ie that half the tillable land of the four eastern tiers of counties is in corn each year. The silo would enable you to cut that area down one-third, under a •ervative estimate. Were the labor bestowed upon the smaller area of corn, putting it largely into sites and devoting the land withheld fron 1 to alfalfa, there is no doubt tha- e number of rattle could be main - tained, than are at present. The incidental advantages that will follow the introduction of the silo are many Your cattle will be fed under shelter, and the manure sowed and this I am sure must soon be as 1 as for the eastern fanner.

The reward merit is given for economy and equality in Let it be under - lod then, that the Farmers' hog must be able to conform t&lt; they exist on our farms. Any fancy point that does not carry with it market value counts for ■ ng. The farmer does not care whether his hog dresses in a coat of red, white or black, or in one of many colors, but he demands that the coat be &gt;e Jine and show quality.

We will only consider those made by the pruning proper. are apt to think that because a tree does not cry out when injured as a person does that it is not greatly hurt and that it does not react. The tree responds to every injury and the stronger the tree the stronger the resistance. And what we want to do is to put ourselves in such p&lt; that we will aid this resistance. This probably can best be brought out owing how the opposite is done. There are four common cases of f-ss pruning. First, a branch is cut leaving a stub of various lengths, one to five inches or even mor ,d, a limb is cut from above and in pulling off peals the bark for several inches; Third, the breaking off of a branch, leaving a jagged surface. Fourth, dead branches are left on a tree, or what is commonly called natural pruning. Bis not that vitality is lost by those careless methods of pruning, but a part of the wood is left exposed. The tree immediately responds. Ba conifer, resin is allowed to escape from the ducts and soon hardens -I on exposure to air. Among the hard woods, as soon as a limb is cut, the heart and sap wood are exposed to the air. These, as you all know, have no power of healing in themselves. The growing tissue of a confined to a very small portion, just underneath the bark, railed ambrium. which is held in check by the bark. Now as soon as you cut Blimb. you relieve the pressure on this growing tissue, the cambrium, an excessive growth takes place, covering the wound with a mass of iimonlv .called callous. The end of the old stub remaining as p and distinct as ever. This process takes considerabl&lt; "Ting tt. Thus in I a stub g left, the callous trie* I the stub up and even if it is able to do in which case the stub must be very small, it will require considerable to do so. The wood then exposed dies, cracks and checks . rface collects the dust which with the dei&lt; i thin soil i«» which ind lodging and sufficient moisture for their germination and growth.

They seem to prepare way for fungi mostly of the toadstool kind which can be seen on almost any decaying log. The fleshy parts seen are produced at the surface for • production of spores, their reproduct -, while the plant proper oath the bark or within the tissues. (See examples.) The fungus spores are blown by the wind . and after finding lodgment as described, germinate. This germination consists in sending out a few delicate threads the spores.

This way entrance is forced to the trunk and then extended indefinitely throughout the trunk. These fungus threads, by means of cretain chemical changes extract the necessary food matter from the plant iiid in return a complex chemical -vhange is brought about in those fibres. These changes brought about by fungus are commonly spoken of as rotting. hanical properties of the wood, • is thus ruined ally, and if not cut will soon blow over and bt a breeding place for other diseases and insects. Wood, however, in the early stages of decay, may be used as a low grade of timber. And in some cases may make very good posts, as the fungus stops growing after tree is cut. A good example of this is the soft rot of the catalpa ( I phorus versiculor). The trees attacked appear t&amp; be in the best of health and Until the tree is pretty well decayed the presence of the disease can only be recognized by the holes left by rotting branches. Later, after the vegetated rilliments of the fungus have extracted a sufficient an of nutritive material, the fruiting bodies appear on the bark of the old stub. (See examples.) Where the holes are of considerable size it is almo* tain that the tree is unsound. Ants and boring beetles soon make a com - plete hollow. Woodpeckers easily remove the pulpy decayed wood. The fungus changes the heart wood into a soft spongy mass, complete! :iig the wood'aa far as the deca; I ■ while the tree is standing, and making it incapable of withstanding any strain. But if the catalp* is cut while the disease is in an &lt; an be used for posts, as the growth of the fungus stops when he same fungus is found on many other trees and as countless thousands of spores are discharged each every year, the chance of ii - shown to be very great, as the spores float about freely in the air. The rate of decay has never been accu - rately established, but large areas have been known to be infected and rendered useless within fifteen years. Even after the wound is covered the fungus threads may continue to extend themselves into the wood, reach - ing the heart and causing the trunk to become hollow. I found one box elder tree along one of the Lincoln streets in which a dead stub had decayed and fallen awn _ r a hole considerably larger than your two fists. E'here are a great number of these I uar to ingle species. Thus it would hardly pay in a discussion of this kind to e up the minute discussion of each.

If a surgeon leaves a ragged, shattered uncovered, disease of some kind is naturally expected. But in surgery, bacteria is about the oniy danger.

HAECKER, NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION. Part I. THE HERD RECORD. The dairy herd was founded in October, 1896, by the purchase of ten rade Jersey heifers. These young heifers were all about two years old and ue to calve in the late fall and early winter. As but a small amount of money was set aside for the purpose of this herd, it was found necessary to &gt;tain animals at a nominal cost, and the ten heifers were purchased in southern Wisconsin and delivered in Lincoln at S32 per head. The breed - : this herd can be described briefly as follows: Full-blooded Jersey res of the same family were used on native stock for several generations, ius producing high grade Jerseys of similar breeding and type. Aside rom the ten heifers, two animals were obtained from local parties and were red differently, one being a full-blooded Jersey, and the other a crossbred with Jersey dam and Shorthorn sire. iFrom the day the herd arrived at the Station, careful records were kept each individual, not only as to milk and butter production, bat 10 as to amount and weight of food consumed and weight of animal, order to obtain accurate weights, the animals were weighed each Mon - y morning before being turned to water, thus avoiding variation caused large and small amounts of water consumed. Each milking was weighed d a sample taken of the same immediately after milking. The milk was ited by the Babcock method, and each week's production was recorded a separate unit in the record book. Under this method it was possible obtain a weekly balance as to the cow's performance and her condition. During the five years covered by the records, many changes were made in the herd as new animals were purchased and some of the old ones sold. Different breeds and grades were introduced, but not with the intent to carry on- a breed experiment. However, the aim was to select representa - tive specimens of each class. In Ihe following tables a year constitutes a lactation period within the limits of twelve consecutive months after the cow's calving.

WILD HAT. The chief grasses used for hay in the State are arfalfa and prairie grass or wild grass. These are generally fed as roughness in the feeding seasons and many farmers either have an abundance of each kind or can obtain them with little difficulty. The question as to which hay is the beet for milk and butter production is therefore an important one to dairymen. FLAN OF THK EXPERIMENT On January 1, 1902, after the dairy herd had been on dry feed for eight weeks and were in a normal feeding condition, twelve cows were selected and divided into two lots. In making the division, care was taken to have each lot about equal as to produtcion of milk and and butter fat. Lot I was put on a ration of alfalfa hay and I wild hay. Besides all the hay they could eat up clean, eac) 16 pounds of beets daily and a small grain ration of one-half bran and one-half corn by weight. One lot was fed alfalfa and the other wild hay for six weeks and then changed about, Lot I getting wild hay and Lot II alfalfa for another period BE8ULT.S.

When lot II was changed from wild hay to alfalfa in the starting of the second six weeks, they were at a disadvantage, having been reduced in the first six weeks' test. It is therefore safe to assume that alfalfa gave even better results than is shown in the above tables. Eie quality of both alfalfa and wild hay was the beet, the latter bei ptionally fine as a result of the dry season of 1901. The animals lots had free access to water and salt during the experiment. Et required a little more wild hay than alfalfa hay. This was due to ;er per cent of waste in the former. In live weight the animals changed but slightly, showing a slight when on alfalfa.

In the winter of 1897. after the herd had been on dry feed for four weeks hey were divided into two lnts. of five in each, the lots being equal as to milk production. ' I was given 30 pounds of sugar beets per day, while Lot II received the same amount of corn silage.

While corn ensilage gave slightly better results than sugar beets when i dairy cows, the difference was so small that it is safe to say th&gt; quite equal in feeding value. Part III. THE BEST WEEK IN A COW'S LACTATION PERIOD. It is often of much importance to know at what time in a cow's lactation she is liable to make her best record. Nearly all of the associations ol our improved eds favor the animals making large milk or butter records. In some cases certain fixed standards are set, as, for example, in the American Cattle Club Association, where fourteen pounds or over of butter is required to admit animals to what is known as the tested "list." In looking over the herd records it was found that a great variation existed as to the best week of lactation. This variation was not only a certain individual cows but it also existed with the same cow from year to year. In order to get reliable data it was quite evident a large number of re&lt; would be required to overcome the varying influence and find a fair average. Minnesota Experiment Station was therefore called on to co-operate with the Nebraska Station, and they were able to furnish 155 records. This, combined with 84 records from the Nebraska Station, gave a total o: Out of this large number of carefully compiled records the following table and results &lt;*re drawn. It was found that nine-tenths of the cows made their best records during the first ten weeks of lactation and that over one-half made their beat rec - ords during the first month. The first week is calculated beginning four days after calving, thus mak - ing the end of the first week eleven days after calving. </seg>

            <seg id="p178">(will be seen that the results of this experiment were very decidedly ivor of early planting. The differences in yields were very marked and e seemed to be no ground for attributing the results to any other cause i the time at which the beets were planted. In view of the fact that sugar beet is naturally very hardy and well adapted to early planting above results may well be worthy of consideration in determining the best time to plant in an ordinary season. Such early planting had not tly been practiced in the locality, and the first week in May was con - a good time to plant the bulk of the crop. In most casw it will idvantage to practice at least some early planting so as to distribute the work of tending the crop. The considerably higher sugar content of the last planting may be attrib - uted to the very small average size of the beets and the almost entire ab - sence of "leaf spot." On the first planting, traces of "leaf spot" were observed as early as July 4. On August 14 the first three plantings showed about 75 per cent of "leaf spot," while the planting of May 28 began to show traces And that of June 23 was entirely free and practically remained so to the end of the season. METHODS OF CULTIVATION This experiment was designed to determine the effects upon the beet crop of various methods of treatment throughout the growing season. The different methods of treatment were as follows: tl. Three-inch cultivation throughout the season, — three acres. 2. Six-inch cultivation throughout the season. — three acres. 3. Ordinary cultivation, consisting of a gradual deepening of the horse-cultivation to four or five inches at the end of the season, — three acres. Plat 4.

The ground used was a part of the described experiment field. All plats were planted in the ordinary way on May 2, and an exceptionally uniform stand was secured. No difficulty was experienced in applying to each plat treatment designed for it. </seg>

The results on the weedy, unhoed plat clearly show the harm that may result from careless treat- it. Both sugar content and tonnage were seriously effected. The re - of gradually deepening the cultivation was somewhat better than that red from the reverse practice. The plat which received the late cul - tion showed a very decided gain in tonnage, yielding nearly four tons e per acre than the plats receiving the ordinary treatment. The lower ir content may be accounted for by considerably larger average size he beets. If the greater yield' was due to the two extra cultivations; eemed to be the case, it shows that the practice may greatly increase profits. The cost of each such cultivation need not exceed f acre, and the increase in yield would need to be but slight to ma extra labor a paying investment. As regards the practice of breaking off the outer leaves, it would seem that good may result, since the yield secured was over two and a half tons more per acre than the average* of the ordinarily treated plats. It has been argued that breaking off leaves or otherwise bruising the best may result in permanent injury, but it was observed in this case that aside from the larger growth of roots the leaves were considerably healthier later in the season, being less effected by "leaf spot" than were the plats on either side. It is well known that the older leaves Are always first attacked by ' ' leaf spot," and it may be that removing them has the effect of deferring the appearance of the disease. While breaking off the leaves, as was pra. in this case, would hardly be practicable in general field practice, the result of the experiment indicates that the objection most strongly urged against cultivation after the spaces between the rows have been closed in by leaves may not be well founded. The result of the experiment in late cul • also contradicts the general supposition. The limited experiment in 1901, recorded in Bulletin 73 of I n, also indicates ' that leaf pruning and late cultivation may be profitable. It may be suggested that leaf pru ing may be most beneficial in dry seasons when the partly developed ro&lt; » unable to gather sufficient moisture to properly support a I . th which was made while there was an abundance of moisture. EXPERIMENTS IN SUGAR HEET SEED PRODUCTION. The work in sugar beet seed production was a continuation of what had been done in former years and partly recorded in earlier bulletins. Th* beets which had been tested and saved for mothers in the fall of 1901 were divided into two lots and planted in the spring of 1902. Lot 1 coii of 1,153 beets testing above 16 per cent of sugar, and Lot 2 beets testing between 14 and 16 per cent. The two lots were planted far ei apart so that no intermingling of pollen between high and low beets *~i-p nl&amp;/»ft TIm roA waa KArv^Mfttfvi nit .Jiilv 2Q .AHnut \K£l nouncia nf </seg>

From 2 about 300 pounds of seed was saved to be used for the factory crop. best of the seed produced in 1901 a five-acre plat was planted mothers for a commercial seed crop in 1903. The plat was a rows eighteen inches apart and the plants thinned to four inches the rows. From this plat several thousand beets were selected Kn the basis of thei seed crop in 1903 their physical appearance and siloed for use for a commer- regular chemical mother beet teat was conducted during the last if October, 1902. Before beginning this test it had been decided id from single individuals so far as possible, and. by keeping the of each separate and selecting only from those individuals which themselves superior in quality and prepotency, to effect a more provement in sugar content and general adaptability. With this view all beets testing over 15 per cent of sugar were kept sepa- ,and each individual was provided with a tag recording its sugar content. le tags were rolled up and placed in the holes made by the rasp in securing a sample of pulp for testing. About 200 beets thus selected and separately labeled were placed in the silo for use in 1903. In this mother beet test, the new method worked out by R. S. I! and R. W. Thatcher, referred to in Bulletin 73, was used and on the whole gave excellent satisfaction.

Allen and the Standard Cattle Company for the very liberal appropriations of land and labor for the experiments recorded in this bulletin, and to Dr. Samuel Avery and the Agricultural Chemical Department for assistance in conducting the mother beet test. rPERATIVE VARIETY TESTS OF CORN" IN 1902 AND 1903. BT PROF T. L. LTON, NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION. Co-operative variety tests were undertaken because of a lack of del knowledge regarding the types of corn Best adapted to different sections or ocalities in the State. A variety test of corn at the Experiment Si is of only limited value to persons wishing to know what type of corn to row in localities remote from the station. The more widely these tests re made the more accurate is our knowledge concerning the value of the ifferent varieties. It is equally important to the grower of pure bred seed corn and to the grower of corn for feeding or for market that he raise the type of corn bant suited to his locality. DIVISION OT THE STATE INTO SECTIONS. The botanical survey of the State has shown that certain regions possess a collection of plants differing markedly from those in other regions, indi - cating a difference in the conditions governing 7 plant growth in the respect - ive sections. Although some of the same plants are found in all sections, the proportion differs greatly. For these experiments the State has divided into six sections, the boundary lines of which correspond more of less closely with those marking change* in the natural vegetation. All variety tests in any one section included the same varieties. Nineteen varieties in all were tested but the max number in any one section was twelve. The larger varieties were a* the eastern sections and the late maturing varieties in the southeast, earlier maturing varieties were used in the north and west, and eared varieties in the west. The following table gives the name of each variety, the 1«&gt; in which the seed was raised, and the section or sections in which tested: </seg>

In almost all portions of the State there was a larger rainfall than the normal, and accompanying this </seg>

Except in : southeastern portion of the State, a larger proportion of the ordinary was not fully matured at the time the killing frost occurred. It to be expected therefore that the late maturing varieties ia these should be at a disadvantage in the tests here recorded. a of 1903 also was unusually cool and wet, but except in the western portion of the State a killing frost did not occur so early. In of the delayed frost, corn did not mature so well as in 1902 owing ( great rainfall and attendant floods in the early part of the summer, which delayed planting, and also to the cold, damp fall weather. • iERMTX ATION TESTS Or SEED USED A germination test was made of the seed of each variety before it was sent, out to the experimenters.

He originated the variety in 1889 by crossing Mammoth Horsetooth with a corn from Kansas having a long, slim ear, The kernels of the Mammoth Horsetooth corn were very deep but far apart, while theKansas corn had short kernels crowded close together. ! this cross, ears showing as nearly as possible a medium between the character- fics of the two varieties were reserved for seed. , The result was a variety ving kernels closer together than the Mammoth Horsetooth corn and sper than the Kansas variety. When Golden Cap was first esta! s kernel was light colored with a golden cap. In 1892 Mr Maher made a •as of the corn above described with a red variety which has given the rnel a reddish yellow color underneath the golden colored cap of the Brnel. Again in 1898 another cross was made with a yellow vari&lt; ving a smooth, shallow kernel, the intention being to make the variety I'he process of crossing continued for two years.

Some of the varieties of corn brought from other States, although not yielding remarkably well in these trials, give evidence of becoming very Bluable varieties after they have been raised in this region for a number of years to become well adapted to the climate.

The object of the experiment just performed at the Nebraska Experi Station and described below was (1) to show that corn can be fed economically in conjunction with foods rich in protein and mineral matter, and (2) to determine which of three common foods is the cheapest source of protein. * PLAN OP THE EXPERIMENT. Twenty pigs, uniform in type, all in good conditiot lots, five pigs in each lot. They were put on long enough to become accustomed to the change bel i, were placed in four experimental n fore the initial weigh- ings were made. The average record of each pig is found in the folio w ing table: &lt; a a « ° * - x _ ■ c it J ' » Lbs. 127 6 Lbs. 206.2 Lb.. 78 6 Lbs. no Lbs. % Iirn meal . &gt;m meal.

The alfalfa fed in this experiment was in the nature of chaff, consisting mostly of leaves which had fallen from the hay as it was thrown from the mow to the barn floor for cattle. For the purpose of making a true eom- of these leaves with the whole plant an analysis was made. The leaves were found to be 40 per cent richer in crude protein than the entire plant, 30 per cent higher in fat, 15 per cent higher in mineral matter, and 60 per cent lower in crude fiber, which substance is largely indigestible matter. This' chaff was first mixed with the corn meal, then placed in the feed trough, where it was made into a thick slop with water. The other lots were fed in the same way, except that the feed for Lot 2 was mixed with skim-milk instead of water. FINANCIAL STATEMENT. With the alfalfa hay worth $7 per tod, the leaves, containing 40 per would be worth approximately $10 per ton. The shorts coat S12.50 per ton delivered. The Dairy Department charged fifteen cents per hundred for the skim-milk used. Corn was delivered to the barns ents per bushel. Adding the usual rate of six cents per hundred for grinding, the corn meal cost $12 per ton. At these prices, each hundred pounds of gain in the several lots cost as follows The skim-milk pigs were the most hearty feeders and made the heaviest gains, but it proved a more expensive source of protein at the prices quoted. This experiment shows that at the market prices quoted and in the pro - portions used in the experiment, skim-milk will make corn bring four cents more per bushel, wheat shorts eight cents more, and alfalfa leaves nine cents more. Assuming that only 5 per cent of the 252,520,173 bushels of corn produced in Nebraska this year is being fed to hogs as a single food, these figures would go to show that over SI, 000, 000 more wealth would be added to the state if wheat shorts or alfalfa were substituted for one-fifth of the corn fed. THE 8LAUOHTER TEST. p corn is deficient in protein and mineral matter, we should naturally expect that pigs when supplied more of these materials from other sources .would have a greater proportion of lean meat, more blood and bone, better developed vital organs, and therefore greater bodily vigor. After the pigs were finished for market, one was selected from the alfalfa lot to represent the pigs that were supplied more protein. A pig twelve pounds heavier was taken from the corn-fed lot. These were both slaughtered and cross-sections of the carcasses placed btefore the students of the School of Agriculture for examination. All were quick to identify the alfalfa-fed pig by the thicker streaks of lean and thinner layers of fat meat. Both the It 1. .t 2. it 3. it 4.

The internal organs weighed as follows: This slaughter test shows that by supplying more protein, in this rase by feeding alfalfa, we get a greater development of internal organs and health and vigor. Undoubtedly, if more attention was given to iU] ing such foods as will bring about a healthy organism, losses from cholera and other diseases would be greatly reduced. The strength of the thigh bones was tested by providing supports at both ids. applying pressure in the middle. This test was made in a ma or testing strength of materials. The bones of the corn-fed pig measured ne-sixteenth of an inch larger in diameter. One bone from the corn-fad g broke under a pressure of 320 pounds and the other 330 pounds, the bones of the corn and alfalfa-fed pigs broke at 500 pounds and the her at 520 pounds. From this test it is evident that breakdowns, which ten occur in heavy corn-fed hogs, are the fault of the feed rather than le animal. It further shows that the ability of the hog to stand up well n legs is a matter of density of bone rather than size. In another experiment varying quantities of alfalfa will be fed to deter - mine the best proportion for making the most economical gains.

For this reason in- dividual tests, accompanied by the conditions under which they were made, are reported. While this bulletin is published for the purpose of making known the </seg>
            <seg id="p202">results of experiments carried en with macaroni wheats in this state, it will be of interest to persons who may be considering the advisability of under - taking their culture to include a short description of the wheats, and ( industry to which they give rise, as well as some evidence looking towards 11 :i_i_ 1 . ;- the possible market for the crop. APPEARANCE AND HABITS OF GROWTH OF MACARONI WHEATS. The macaroni wheats are so called because they are largely used in th manufacture of macaroni and other edible pastes. These products are much used for food in Europe, and are constantly becoming more widely used in this country. The wheats belong to the group Triticujn durum while the common wheats, from which bread is made, belong to Trilicvm vulgare. The macaroni wheats are tall, with broad, smooth leaves. Th heads are heavily bearded, being much more so than any of the ordinary wheats, and the plant when headed has much the appearance of barley The heads are large and vary in color from light yellow to almost black depending upon the variety. The kernels are large, very hard, having lea* starch than common wheat. They vary from light yellow to reddish yellow in color. The habits of growth of durum wheats adapt them to regions of light rainfall. They have great ability to withstand drouth and heat, but require a rich soil, although they are notably tolerant of alkali. In some mild climates durum wheats are sown in the fall, but generally they are grown as spring wheats, and they must occupy that place in Ne - braska at present. The principal durum wheat-growing countries are Russia, Turkestan, North Africa, the drier portions of Argentina, Chile, India and Asia Minor, and to some extent Spain, Italy, Greece, Roumania, Mexico and th. tral American states. FOREIGN MARKET FOB MACARONI WHEAT. One of the most important considerations in the attempt to introduce durum wheat culture into this country is that of a market for the crop What the foreign demand for edible pastes has become in the last few years may be appreciated by reading the following facts taken from a report by Mr. Robert P. Skinner, Consul General at Marseilles* The European demand for macaroni wheat has increased with remarkable rapidity within recent years. The present consumption of macaroni wheat by the factories in Marseilles alone is 24,000 bushels daily. The output o macaroni and edible pastes in that city is limited only by the supply of wheat suitable for their manufacture. Throughout the entire Mediterranean country there has been a corresponding increase in the manufacture of these products. Semolino mills have been erected, or are in course of construction in all the important wheat markets, and in the Levant. Perhaps the large* semolino mill in the world is one recently built at Salonica, which has a daily capacity of over 7,000 bushels of wheat. *U. 8. Dept. of Agr.. Bureau of Plant Industry; Bull.

Large quantities of durum wheats are boi ported into France and Italy, from Russia and Algeria. Tin make the beet quality of macaroni, but owing to their scarcity they are fre - quently mixed with the softer wheats from western Europe. Durum wheat Russian seed is being grown in France in considerable quantity the product even from the first year's crop is not equal to the Kussian - grown wheat. E There would seem to be no reason why there should not easing demand for American dun* ae Eruopean mark- HOME MARKET FOR MACARONI WHEAT icerning the home market for duru te, Mr. &gt;l alist of tl \gricultn -:* nle the prospects are very good for a foreign market for these wheats sufficient to utilize probably all that we can produce for several years, an lent market is also likely to be developed sooner or later in ou macaroni factories. At present all - with rare excej use the flour of common bread wheat is chiefly due to the fact that heretofore it has been impossible to i true macaroni wheats in this country, and it is considered impracticable to import them. Most of the factories realize the importance of using semo - &gt;f such wheats as soon as they can obtain it in sufficient amount and of good quality. It will certainly be of the greatest advantage to the fa. as well as to the growers to i &gt;rade between them in the ■ wheats. The factories will thus be able to obtain either the wheats or semolino made from them at much less cost than the imported material. and the farmers will have the benefit of- a quick home market. f Another strong advantage in using these wheats in our own f:t&lt; which especially effect- - in the fact that the 1 le product, other conditions being equal, is always much better from standpoint of simple freshness. We all know how much better ran old, and what a nutty flavor newly-made flour gives to the : hese facts apply with even greater force in macaroni making, imported macaronies must of necessity have lost a large per cent of their or, and as the homemade product is made almost entirely froi ats, it follows that the majority of American people really have never ed the very best macaroni. "More than all else the use of macaroni as a food is far from general in this country, and should become more popular. It is a comparatively rare food with us. As already quoted in another place, in France alone the annual output of edible pastes is estimated at from 120,000,000 to 170,000,000 pounds. A considerable amount of this is, of course, exported, but there remains an enormous amount which is consumed in France. liflpt. of A«r.. Bureau of Plant industry; Bui </seg>
            <seg id="p204">207 These pastes are among the most common and popular foods in that country. The same may be said of Italy. Let a sufficient amount of good wheat be grown and our factories begin producing from these wheats its best a &gt;le, in a variety of forms, and there is no good reason apparent why such foods should not soon rank in popularity with our breakfast foods." ONE HUNDRED AND ONE TESTS THROUGHOUT NEBRASKA. tl'lif durum wheats distributed in the spring of 1902 consisted of a in r of varieties, most of which were imported directly from Algeria and mainder from Russia, except a small amount grown in this is perhaps unfortunate that more of the seed was not of Russian origin, r the results indicate very plainly that it is more productive than that Mgeria. Previous experience has also shown that seed grown at ist one year in this region gives lar&gt;; than imported seed.

Those raised at &lt;n were very badly rusted, and also lodged They appeared to be fully as susceptible to rust as other varieties ring when' Khe average time of ripening was July 16, both for the tests made through - the state, and for those made at the Station. The average time of ripen - for sowings made before April 1 was the same as for those made after ill. The* average yield of all sowings made before April 1 was 19.5 bushels per acre; of all sowings made after April 1, 17.5 bushels per acre, indicates that, for at least the year reported, early planting was desirable. As macaroni wheats are not easily injured by frost, this rule will doubtless hold good for all ordinary years. Eie average yield per acre and number of tests of each variety were as ws: per acre for the Russian varieties was 21.2 bushels, and for the Al. ties 17.6 bush. A test of a number of varieties of durum wheats was made at tl ment Station. The unusually wet weather and hard wind storms inter - fered much with the growth of the wheats, and doubtless decreased the yields. The test is therefore of less value than it would have been in a nor - mal season. All varieties were planted March 20 to 27 and were put in with a press drill.

The calves were received at the University farm October 1, 1900. They were placed on a clover and mixed grass pasture. On October 15 they were given a small ration of grain consisting of one-half corn, one bran and one-fourth oats, which was increased gradually until, on November 1, they were eating two and one-half pounds each per day. On October 19 these calves weighed 6,780 pounds, or 339 pounds each. During the i \ ember they received alfalfa hay with an increasing grain ration until, November 30, they were eating five pounds each per day and weighed 7,425 pounds. On December 1, 1900, the steers were divided into three lots of six steers e~h. Lot 1, six Shorthorn steers, weighed 2,515 pounds. Lot 2, six Hereford steers, weighed 2,485 pounds. Lot 3, six Hereford steers, weighed 2,425 pounds, Lots 1 and 2 received alfalfa hay and a grain ration Lot 3 received sorghum hay and the same grain ration, which consisted of one-half corn, one-fourth oats and one-fourth bran. Beginning with I grain ration of five pounds each per day and a hay ration of six pounds ch per day, the grain ration was gradually increased to eight pounds each ir day and continued at that rate until April 20, 1901, when the experi - ent was terminated on account of dehorning, which caused a considerable linkage in weights that was not recovered until after they were turned grass May 4, 1901.

On May 4 these lots were redivided, one-half of the sorghum-fed stows and one-half of the alfalfa-fed steers being placed on pasture only, while the other half were fed grain with pasture throughout the summer. This placed nine steers in each lot, but the grain-fed lot was added to by two Aberdeen-Angus steers which were purchased in April. STEERS ON PASTURE. On May 4, 1901. nine steers weighing 5,545 pounds, or an average of 616 pounds each, were placed in a sixteen-acre pasture containing brome grass, mixed grasses, and three acres of alfalfa. Two acres of this field was newly seeded and furnished very little pasture during the summer. On account of the extreme drought of 1901, the feed became very short during the latter part of August, but with the rains of early September the pasture improved, especially the alfalfa, and there was fair pasture in the field at the they were removed, November 1, 1901. STEER8 ON GRAIN. The nine steers on grain, which were to be compared with the nine on pasture, weighed 5,485 pounds, or an average of 609 pounds each. T nine steers were added two Angus steers weighing an average of 600 {&gt;■ each, making eleven head. The- ra were placed on grain and pasture May 4 and had the run of about thirteen acres of low bottom land until August 15, when they were given another pasture for forty-five days and returned to their original pasture about October 1, after it had been improved by autumn r . For the sake of comparison, the records of weights were so kept as to nine the gains of different steers. It will be seen that while the gain of the steers wintered on sorghum hay was less during the winter than those wintered on alfalfa, the summer gains of these sorghum-fed steers was enough greater to overcome their smaller gains of the previous winter and to place them on even weights with the alfalfa-fed steers by the end &lt; pasture season. The grain ration from May 4 to August 17 consisted of corn meal. On this date the ration was changed to 75 per cent corn and 25 per cent bran, which was continued until November 1 without change. During the i period each steer on grain consumed 1,893 pounds of corn meal and 290 pounds of bran. In the financial statement corn is valued at 40 cents per bushel, bran at $16 per ton, and pasture at S3 per aere. </seg>

CONCLUSIONS. 1. This experiment shows that when steers are to be marketed in the fall or early winter there is more profit in summer feeding with grain on paaiure. «\\^^re steers are to be winter-fed on grain for a spring market, there is more profit to feed no grain on pasture. See Experiment III. The failure of the corn crop of 1901 made the market for feeding ■teen very bad and destroyed the profit that would ordinarily have been produced on a bunch of cattle making 292 pounds gain in six months on pasture only, but the subsequent winter feeding was very profitable and war - ranted placing a higher value on these steers as feeders. IThe high price of fat cattle permitted us to sell the grain-fed cattle profit even after having fed them on corn worth forty cents per bushel ig the summer. Experiment III WHEAT VS. CORN IN A RATION FOR FATTENING STEERS. E. A. BURNETT. H. R. SMITH. November 1, 1901, the 20 steers that had been on the Grain vs. No Grain experiment during the summer were taken to the yards to prepare for an experiment on the relative feeding value of wheat and corn in a grain ration. Eighteen of these steers were grade Hereford and Shorthorn and two were grade Angus. Eleven had been grain fed during the summer and were divided into Lots 1 and 2. Nine head had been on pasture only and were divided into Lots 3 and 4. Lot, 1 contained six steers for Period I and four steers for Period II Lot 2 contained five steers for Period I and four steers for Period II. Lot 3 contained five steers for both Period I and Period II. Lot 4 contained four steers for both Period I and Period II. These steers were given a four weeks' preliminary feeding period before K experiment proper commenced. During this time the steers in Lots 1 2 gained 36 pounds each and those in Lots 3 and 4 gained 72 pounds i, which should be taken into account in a six-months' feeding period i a financial statement. The experiment proper is divided into two periods, Period I of 11 week* and Period II of 12 weeks. The ration for Period I was as follows: Lots 1 and 3 received a grain ration 80 per cent wheat and 20 per cent Lots 2 and 4 received a grain ration 80 per cent corn and 20 per All lots received alfalfa hay for roughness.

Valuing the pigs at $4.50 per hundred at the begining of the experiment and at their market value of $6.00 at the close of the experiment, they made a net profit to the steers. The price, $6.00, is fixed a 1 pigs were still too small to market. They : fed on experiment to July 21, and sold at $7.00 per hundred as reported VIII, "Corn vs. wheat for pigs on alfalfa pasture." During the period when alfalfa only was fed as rouhgness. the Bt in too laxative a condition to produce the best results, and the ad and wheat straw in the ration overcame this trouble in the of the experiment. &gt;e steers which had been summer fed on grain should more properly been sold for beef in early winter, but as they wen 1050 pounds when the experi: ••mber ed to feed them through the winter.

Lots 1 and 2 had been fed grain continuously from weaning time, consum - ing in all 5790 pounds. Lots 3 and 4 were fed grain during the first winter and again from November 1, 1901, to the time of selling. They consumed in all 3685 pounds of grain from weaning time to the time they were sold. These steers were sold to Cudahy 4 Company and were slaughter* export. After cooling, Lots 1 and 2, which weighed 1320 average alive, dressed 64.48 per cent of their live weight.

This experiment shows a profit of $10.14 per head on summe yearling cattle compared with S19.63 on cattle of the same quality which were on grass only during the summer.

In December, 1899, 18 steers were purchased at South Omaha for the Experiment Station to test the value of rations and of shelter for winter feeding. The three conditions imposed were as follows: Six steers were confined in open sheds 8x14 feet with a yard attached of the same sise, making a stall and yard 8x28 feet, in which a single steer was confined, shed opened on the east and was protected from southwest winds and par - tially protected from northeast winds. Six steers were also confined in box stalls 8x12 feet, opening to the south. They had no exercise except when driven to the scales, and the privilege of a small yard while the stall was being cleaned daily. One steer was con - fined in each stall. Six steers were also fed in an open yard 100x200 feet in dimensions, having n open shed 16x24 feet facing south, under which they could run at pleasure. 'hey were also protected from the north by a shed 85 feet long and 10 feet ligh, a tight board fence 6 feet high along the remainder of the north side f the yard. These different yards and pens had been built the pre rear with a view of determining the effect of exposure upon the gains of nimals in the feed lot, and, though the number subjected to the experi - ment was too small to give definite r e data secured is published. It was not thought wise to complies peri merit by too many dif - ferent rations, and we therefore determined to use ajfalfa hay for roughness and to use' three different grain rations, viz., corn meal, corn meal and one - fourth oats, and corn meal and one-fourth bran, as the grain rations to test their relative values when fed with alfalfa hay. The results of the experi - ment indicate that more definite information on the value of shelter might have been secured had only one grain ration been used. The lot of 18 weighed 14,870 pounds at the stock yards in Omaha, Decem - ber 4, 1899, or an -average of 826 pounds. They were probably yearling steers with possibly one exception. </seg>

In these feeding operations, as in all feeding, the large gains proved to be the cheapi - re not made i ne ration akin the shed age gain of 444 pounds each whereas the average gain of the 18 steers was only 350 pounds. It was also that the poorest gain made by any one of the was made in a box stall in this shed by No. 9, but it is probable that this was due to the peculiarities of the steer rather than to the surroundings. He was never a good feeeder as he consumed from 100 to 400 pounds less grain than the other steers, and was one of the heaviest steers outside of No. 5 when the put into the experiment. At this time he weighed 915 pounds, while the six in this shed averaged only 860 pounds The average gains of the lots of six steers according to the shelter was as follows Six open-shed-and-pen steers made 330 pounds average gain Six box-stall steers made 400 pounds average gain.

            <seg id="p238">241 The average gain by lots on the same kind of feed and under the same condition is given in Table IV, but if we average all lots on one kind of feed, but under different conditions, we find the following results: Ten steers on corn meal and alfalfa hay made 344 pounds average gain. Four steers on corn meal and oats and alfalfa hay made 344 pounds average Four steers on corn meal and bran and alfalfa hay made 381 pounds average gain. Kthis experiment corn meal and alfalfa in the box stall gave the largest Corn meal, bran and alfalfa in the box stall gave the second largest Corn meal, bran and alfalfa in the open shed and pen g*ave the third t gain. Experiment V. RAISING CALVES FOR BEEF PRODUCTION— SKIM-MILK VS. SUCKING DAM. E. A. BURNETT. In the spring of 1899 the Department of Dairy Husbandry at the Station undertook an experiment to determine the relative profit of milking beef - bred cows and feeding the calves from these cows on separator skim and a grain ration, compared with allowing the calf to run with its mother until weaning time. Six calves were used in that experiment, the results of which are reported in Bulletin No. 68. All these calves were well-bred grade Hereford* except Lot 2, which steer was one-half Jersey with consid - erable Shorthorn blood, but was a good blocky steer of moderate quality. The calves that sucked the cows in this experiment were weaned I ■'■ ber 1, 1899, and on December 9 they were transferred to the Department of Animal Husbandry to be fed for the purpose of determining what effect their previous treatment would have on their value for beef produ K December 9, 1899, these calves were divided as follows: The skim - calves were numbered Lots 1, 2, 3. The calves that had run with were numbered Lots 4, 5, 6. They weighed as follows: K.t 1, 435 pounds; Lot 2, 415 pounds; Lot 3, 380 pounds; average of three lots fed, 410 pounds; average age, 190 days. t&gt;* 4, 390 pounds; Lot 5. 360 pounds; Lot 6, 380 pounds; average of three lots sucking cows, 377 pounds; average age, 191 days. These calves were carried forward for the next 16 months in three periods, as follows: Kriod I, from December 9. 1899. to May 5, 1900, 147 days, during which they were fed on alfalfa hay and a grain ration three-fourths corn and ourth bran. tiod II, from May 5, 1900, to November 3, 1900, 182 days, during which were on pasture and received a grain ration of eight pounds each per consisting of one-half corn, one-quarter oats and one-quarter bran. Period III, from November 3, 1900, to April 27, 1901, 147 days, during which time five animals only were fed, the ration consisting of one-half corn, one-quarter oats, and one-quarter bran, with alfalfa hay and roots. </seg>
            <seg id="p239">jil 6, a heifer, was withdrawn from the experiment after the second nod As she made average gains during the first two periods, there is reason to think that from this experiment the calves running with their mi. are better for beef production than calves fed under the best known Is on sweet separator milk and a grain ration to replace the fat and ids which are taken from the milk in skimming. It will be noted from e first weights that the calves that had been fed were heavier for their age weaning time than those that ran with the cows and had pasture with grain. Some difference in quality was visible, even at the end of the rst winter, in favor of the calves that had sucked their dams, but this ild not be detected after they had been on grass, and was not apparent selling time.

This steer was ted in his supply of roughness, and during the last six months of his feed - ing it was necessary to guard against over-ripeness, as will be indicated by small consumption of grain between April 28 and November was fed twice daily until about the first of October, after w It is interesting to note that this steer, during the last two years of his life, required 6.6 pounds of grain to produce one pound of gain and less than ten pounds of total food to produce a pound of gain, not counting the food 358 days on pasture. This record would tend to show that ■attic can be economically produced if they are so fed that they to make good gains up to the time when they are finished. ords show that this steer dressed 67.3 per cent, giving a dressed 1,107 pounds from a live weight of 1.645 pounds, with onh and 6.08 per cent hide. The rather heavy hide was due to an exceedingly heavy coat of hair and not to extreme thickness of the skin. This steer is a conspicuous example of the effect of good blood in improving the common cattle of the country. He was a low-down, blocky, thick - fleshed type, which are noted as being good feeders, and was a worthy scion of hi? illustrious grandsire, Earl of Shadeland 22d. He demonstrated the fact that steers of the right type are rent payers, and that profit lies h tiuous growth. E. A. BURNETT P January, 1902, a lot of twelve Aberdeen-Angus calves was purchased be purpose of determining how such stock could be most cheaply win - and still be brought to grass in good condition to go on and make sum - gains. These calves were divided into two lota of six each. Lots 1 and 2 were placed under test on January 18, 1902, after two weeks of preliminary feeding Lot 1, six steers, weighed 2,950 pounds. They received a ration of alfalfa hay and prairie hay with no grain. Lot 2, six calves, weighed 2,885 pounds. They received the same rough - ness as lot 1, but in addition received a ration of four pounds of grain per day. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">small grain ration even when good gains can be secured on hay alone. The character of the roughness should be noted, as the too prevalent habit of wintering calves without grain generally results in their coming through the winter in bad condition and without having gained in weight. From the facts at hand, this does not seem necessary when good alfalfa and prairie hay are available. A mixture of alfalfa and prairie hay was thought to be preferable to alfalfa alone, as it prevented scouring, which often resulted when prairie hay was not fed regularly. The proportion in which this hay was fed, namely, 80 per cent alfalfa and 20 per cent prairie hay, seemed to tit nearly all scouring and to represent about the proportion desired ■ animals of the quality of hay being fed. ober 30, 1902, these steers were weighed again, to determine the summer gains. Those in Lot 1 weighed 880 pounds each and those in Lot 2,900 pounds each. Those that had no grain during the winter had there - fore gained 288 pounds since April 20, or a period of 192 days, while those in Lot 2 had gained only 234 pounds in that time. Although the steers in Lot 1 were only 20 pounds lighter October 30, there was yet a noticeable difference in quality. Mr. Noe, with Clay, Robinson . South Omaha, estimated Lot 1 at $4.75 per hundred and Lot 2 at $5. At these figures the steers in Lot 1 are worth $41.80 and those in Lot 2, $45 each. With pasture at $3 per acre, charging each the same rate, we find that the steers in Lot 1 make a net profit of $4.74 and those in Lot 2 $5.73 each from April 20 to October 30, 1902. The steers of both lots will be fed through the winter, so the final results will be known in a few months hence. The same experiment will be repeated with a larger number of calves the coming winter. rE DINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. » experiment continued until April 20, a period of thirteen weeks, these steers were turned together upon pasture in the same field.

While the pigs were not prime feeders, they were divided in such a way as to make the lots fairly even in quality and weight. The experiment was carried on in a closed shed where each lot had the run of a small pen 8x12 feet and small yard adjacent 8x16 feet. All pens had cement floors, which proved unsatisfactory during the severely cold weather. The only way by which the pigs could be kept at all comfortable was by keeping them heavily bedded with straw so they would not come in close contact with the cold cement. Previous to the experiment, all lots had the same ration ing of :. shorts and wheat. Each lot was put upon its experimental ration 'lays previous to the first weighing so that all should become accustomed be new rations.

WHEAT FOR PIGS ON ALFALFA 1 E. A. HI KNETT, H. R. SMITH. May 8, 1902, 18 pigs were placed in three quarter-acre lots of alfalfa. The pigs were divided so that each lot contained six pigs approximately even in quality and weight. These pigs were a mixed lot of Tamworth and Duroc crossbreds and had previously run behind experimental steers where bsi.sted on ground wheat and corn droppings, one pig to each steer, with one pound of shorts additional. t&gt;t 1 was given a ration of ground corn; Lot 2, 95 per cent ground 5 per cent dried blood ; and Lot 3, ground wheat. Each lot was given y of alfalfa pasture and all were on rape one week. The following table shows the average gains and cost per hundred pounds of gain. Table XIII. — Wheat v». corn for pigs on alfalfa pasture. In determining the cost of food per 100 pounds of gain corn was valued 11.00 per cwt., wheat at $1.10, and dried blood at that time was quoted $2.50 per cwt. From the table it will be noted that the gains on corn with alfalfa were smallest, the wheat ration and the ration consiting of 5 per cen: of dried blood and corn giving the same gains. Figuring these product* at market values it will be seen that the cost of 100 pounds of gain on Mi and alfalfa was slightly below corn and dried blood, and thirteen cents p hundred below wheat. Ead the wheat been purchased at $1.06 per cwt. and the dried blood at 6 per cwt., the cost of 100 pounds of gain made by Lots 2 and 3 would ; been the same as in Lot 1 on corn at SI. 00 per cwt. tVhile the cost of 100 pounds gain on corn and alfalfa was lowest it will noted that the net profits on both Lot II and Lot III were greater than t I on corn.

ROCK PINE. w seopuiorum (Engehnai uon, Garden and Forest, 10 (18 1 .- In former reports this has been called "Bull Pine," and the species has been given as P. ponderosa, but I am now convinced that it ia better to regard it as a separate, but closely allied species. The two trees differ in size of tree, cones, and length and number of leaves, the Pine being smaller, having smaller cones, with leaves in twos, and shorter than in the true Bull Pine. This tree forms dense forests in the ■ northwestern and northern portions of the state, extending from the ming line along Pine Ridge and the Niobrara river to the eastern boundary of Rock and Key a Paha counties. It occurs also on the ii Platte river as far east as Deuel county, and also south of ■ that river on the Wild Cat mountains, and the outlying hills. It is so abundant in this latter region that saw mills have been erected. and much lumber manufactured from it. It is said to occur, aU isolated patches on the high rough land between the North Platte river and Pine Ridge. I have myself not seen the pine in this la locality, but it is so reported by government surveyors. It occurs in limited areas in the Loup valley in the eastern edge of the Sand 1 1 and also in Greeley and Custer counties. It formerly occurred along the Platte river eighteen or twenty miles east of the junction of North and South Platte rivers, as is shown by fragments of roots dug from the ground. Similarly, it formerly occurred in Franklin con in the Republican valley, whore it seems now to be extinct. Thig tree has acquired new ii thin the last few years from the fact that I it has been found to be an excellent one for planting in the Sand Hills of ci i&gt;raska, v -nsive plantations have already been made. Its seeds germinate readily, and the young trees are hardy and easily transplanted. In the parts of the state where the trees grow naturally, seeds are formed abundantly, and in many places where ■ fires and cattle are kept out the seedlings are very numerous and thrift i in the far western portions of the state it is not at all an uncommon thing to find an old tree surrounded by a colony of young trees which have sprung up from the seeds scattered by the wind on the prairie sod. The lumber made from this tree is of fair ■ quality and resembles somewhat that of the Hard Pine of the South, but with a coarser grain and a little more tendency to warp. It makes "dimension lumber," and is considerably used for this purpose in the western and northwestern portions of the state. RED n Juniperus virginiana L. Sp.

Cement is rapidly displacing large amounts of other building material, such as stone, brick, iron, and wood, which is but : usefulness and is evidence of its thoroughly pi -h the writer in his experiments is confined to a small town lot and it thus debarred from testing the uses of cement on the farm, he haw nevertheless visited many homes in the western, middle, and eastern state** and « what the practical men are doing with cemt its larger and more striking uses we migh: that walLs for buildings both large and small, and even solid buildi ire being made of it. That is, dwelling houses as well as great business blocks are made of cement, including walls, partitions, floors an&lt;i east in solid cement without - are fire wind proof, and dust proof, and are literally like I t( out of a rock. Great dams are made of it to impound water for irrigation power, dikes and barriers are built of it I oa and waves, and abutments and piers are built of it for bridges and viaducts where it proves to be more serviceable than other material. It is also used extensively for piling, taking the place of the oak piles which used to be driven into soft ground to make stable foundations for great p buildings. It is cast into blocks, imitating pebbled, dressed, and carved stone of various designs, and is laid into bui and per - manence like the costly stone which it - illy imitates. It is used for street curbing, crossings, pavements, walks in public and private ground*, and as floors in business houses, stables and cellars. Whether used as mortar in laying strong walls or for the more refined use* to which it is put. it is equally well adapted, and what is of part significance is the fact that its use is not confirm is within the reach of all, and though the dema: of it is going down. Furthermore, it doe- ical know - ledge or long apprenticeship to learn to use it. itrary . th&lt; on the farm can use it, and can take ad abundant energy .thereby adding greatly to the usefulness and convenience of his place. </seg>

It makes a tank which cert - well and is said to give excellent service. We have seen watering troughs built in the same fashion, which gave us the impression that here was an idea worth eop Such troughs are generally sunk well in the ground and are rather shallow, and are so shaped as to escape rupture on freezing. One of the best I of the kind observed was a long swill-trough. This was raised but FIG. 12 A cement swill-trough. well buried, so an to project but .-.lightly above the wxl.

The builder claimed that it had saved its price many times mt it had been in service for years, and that there was no apparent reason why it should not last for his lifetime. Such permanent improvements as lese are not only money getters for the owners, but also save the wear and tear and worry of constant planning. Every time a farmer builds a new rough, a certain amount of money and time must go into it, and this i&gt; &gt;erhaps, be better employed in other improvements. It always seem - ead loss to be constantly rebuilding and repairing, and where one can afford , it certainly seems better policy to build permanently. These tr mpress one favorably and the practical man's attention is directe as something doubtless to be recommended.

Hut bettor than all is the advantage gained in two respects alone. The cement resting directly on the ground all Band vermin are excluded once for all. Then the stable floor being as i and close grained as stone itself, no stable waste is absorbed as in wood re, to give off destructive and disagreeable ammonia gases afterward. FIG. 13 Three blocks of hollow, artificial stone, as made by Reimen &amp; Fried, of Lincoln, and extensively used for foundations and walls -tables are peculiarly free from barn odors. They are more easily cleaned and the owner would not change for any other form of floor, moniaeal gases are not only injur but quite destructive of the Bnish on carriages and vehicles. This difficulty seems to be full sn the concrete floor is laid. For the cellar floor of the ordinary hing is better than cement, if one can afford it, and he cannot ni not to have it when he stops to consider that his house is to be I place, which is to be sanitary or unsanitary accord most sanitary floor is one of cement which excludes moisture and is readily swept and cleaned BIf one takes pains to observe, he will not have to go far until he sees houses lit of concrete, but it must be remembered that the ly resemble B;ual stone as to deceive, and so may be overlooked. On one farm we ticeda shed 18feet square. of which the side walls, the floor, and even the &gt;f , were made of cement. While still green, the plaster was laid off in lares by scratching it with a pointed tool, and the effect was that of the jken joints of masonry. </seg>

It ia well for amateurs to take a hint from the experienced, and use means to prevent drying. The question naturally arises, where do we get our cement, and in reply it may be said briefly, that part of it comes from abroad, and part of it is made at home. It is produced in our neighboring states, but i Nebraska. This is the more unfortunate, since we have the cement r&lt; great abundance and desire to have new industries established. If there is any problem connected with the manufacture of cement that of fuel alone. The demand for cement is here, the rock is here, the demand is increasing and all that seems of special concern is t I fuel, and since our shipping facilities ar - han some of the places around us where cement is produced, it is probable that we can compete with a' the other states in its production.
