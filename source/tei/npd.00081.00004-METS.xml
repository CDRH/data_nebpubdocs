The activities detailed in this report must interest every citizen and taxpayer of Nebraska at one point or another. No other department of the. s ate's activities touches the various communities at more vital points of contact than the great group of institutions under the direct supervision and management of the State Board Ml' Control. There are sevei.teen operating State Institutions under the Su - pervision of the Board of Control. On July 1, 19*4, the Federal Government gave to the state of Nebraska what lias been known as the United States Indian School, located at Genoa, Nebraska. The Legislature designated this as the Genoa 5tate Hospital for mental patients, placing it under the jurisdiction of the State Board of Control, thus creating another State Hospital and making a total of eighteen penal, chari - table and correctional institutions in Nebraska. An earnest enc.eavor has been made by the superintendents and the members of the Board to study the individual needs of the various groups of the wards of the State, and to carry out sucli policies and principals as will best serve in the mental, moral, physical and social ljehabilitation of the individuals, and will be for the best interests ot the State. Tlie business activities of the Board are set forth in detail for the benefit of the Legislature, as well as the taxpayers as a whole, and the closest possible attention has been paid to the many needs of the State's wards in order to secure just, humane and economical administration consistent with those needs. The term of Marry S. Thorpe expired June 30, 1933, and Henry Behrens of I leaner was appointed by the Governor to suc - ceed Mr. Thorpe. During the biennium covered by this report, the following changes were made 1 in the official personnel ; At the Hastings </seg>

Dr. H. H Stretton resigned on March 15, 1935. At the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, T. L. Havlicek, M. D., Assistant Physician, resigned on March 22, 1934, and L. C. Albertson, M. D., was appointed on March 23, 1934, to fill the vacancy. Anna M. Staubitz resigned as matron and was replaced on January 16, 1935, by Charlotte Kokjer. Warden W. T. Fenton of the State Penitentiary resigned his position on September 15, 1934, and Dan G. Kavanaugh, deputy warden, was promoted to fill the vacancy. Otto E Dudschus was appointed deputy warden on December 1, 1934. On January 24, 1935, Dan G. Kavanaugh passed away, and N. T. Harmon was appointee! on February 20, 1935, to the position of warden. On October 19, 1934, R. O. Brandt replaced Wiley Langford as chief clerk. 'Mr. Edward E. Ely replaced C. D. Owens as adjutant of the Soldiers and Sailors' Home at Milford, Nebraska, on April K&gt;, 1934. Mrs. Frona Lockard, matron of West Hall at the Re - formatory for Women, passed away on September 9, 1933, and the position was filled by Mrs. Nellie Ford on September 23, 1933. During the biennium the following major expenditures were made for buildings, equipment and improvements : Institution for Feeble-Minded, Beatrice : New Dormitory and Dining Hall $56,000.00 Farm Cottage and Dormitory 10,(KM).(K) Hastings State Hospital, Ingleside: Remodeling Building to make additional dormitory room 'MKKMMi Emergency Repairs on old boilers 5,000.00 Equipment for Laundry 2,N(H1.00 Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney : New Water Supply 3,000.00 Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln : "L" on Receiving Hospital Building 25,000.00 Laundry Equipment 15,000.00 Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford : New Well 3.000.00 Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk : "■ Laundry Building and Equipment 30,000.00 Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln : Fireproof Dormitory for Boys 40,000.00 4 </seg>

Because of mc: -eased costs on account of the NRA and other government policies, we found it necessary to ask for additional grants m order to do the construction work contemplated by the Legislature at the time appropriations Were made. Conforming wih the program of the Federal Government, the lioard of Control made application for PWA grants for construction • iiid repair work, and was granted the following: Institution for Feeble-Minded, Beatrice: New Dormitorj and Dining Hall and Farm Cottage and Dormitory :.„.„] $23 1(X)(X) Lincoln State Hopital, Lincoln: "L" on Receiving Hospital Building 9,0001)0 Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk: Laundry Buildiig 1 8 000 00 I lome for Dependent Children, Lincoln : Fireproof Dorn itory for Boys 13 000 00 The biennium vas closed with a very small deficit, m spite of the Fact that the legislative appropriation for maintenance was re - duced and that ,ye acperienced a complete crop failure due to the drouth. This was made possible by reducing salaries of employes, curtailing expenditures wherever and by the hearty and intelligent cooperation on the part of the superintendents and other officers of the institu :ions. We wish to thank Governor Charles W. Bryan for the confi - dence and advice exended to the Board of Control, and to express our appreciation to- the superintendents, officers and employees of the institutions, for their splendid cooperation m making possible the improvements that have been done during the past biennium.

This property was assigned to the Board of Control by a legis - lative act, (Senate File No. 99), to be known as the Genoa State Hospital. A special appropriation was made ( House Roll No. 678) ap - propriating $35,000.00 for the purpose of rehabilitating the Indian School land and buildings so that the same could be properly and profitably employed as a state institution under the direction of the Board of Control. Following the expressed desires of the different legislators. $8,241.44 was spent m the necessary purchase of horses, machinery, seed and equipment to properly carry on the agricultural activities to the best interests of the State of Nebraska. Intensified and diversified crop raising lias been attempted for the first season. </seg>

            <seg id="p026">To the Governor am the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I herewith subriit the Twenty-Fifth Biennial Report of the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded, for the period June 30, 1933 to July 1, 1935. During this period we have admitted 74 males and 90 females; 60 have been discharged during the biennium and 75 have died. Our population is 1171 m he institution, and the number out on parole or vacation is 96. Many of these on vacation will return when school opens September Ist. During the bienn urn we have sterilized 14 males and 31 females. When these boys anc girls leave the institution they are carried on parole for one year, at the end of which time they are discharged from the Institution if they are progressing favorably. Of the 31 girls and 14 boys steiilized, 23 girls and 9 boys are now outside and evidently getting along satisfactorily. 5 boys and 8 girls are still m the Institution pending the time when we may be able to make satis - factory arrangements for them outside. The Institution i ; completely filled up at the present time, with a large number on the waiting list. We expect to open a new build - ing and farm cottage to accomodate 120 girls and 20 boys. At that lime we expect to be able to take care of our waiting list. When we have accepted all )f these that we are able to take, we will again be m the same positi mi that we have been for a number of years, completely filled up a id applications arriving almost daily. Our water problc mis still unsettled. For years the Institution lias been threatened with a water shortage necessitating the con - struction of new well: which have pumped out m 5 or 6 years, mak - ing our water questio i a vital one. Our Institution has grown to the point where we require about 200,000 gallons of wa er per day. During the summer, man emer - gency, we laid a 4 inch lina to connect with the Beatrice water sys - 21 </seg>
            <seg id="p027">22 tem. This was used pipe and will not last long. Some permanent arrangements for water will have to be made soon. The Governor has recommended and the Legislature appropriated $2,000.00 for investigation and plans fefa water supply for us. y and we are anx - iously looking forward to a solution of our water problem. Our Institution has grown to such an extent that stand-pipe pressure was no longer sufficient to furnish water on the upper floors of some of our buildings; therefore we have installed at the boiler house a steam turbine engine directly connected with a centrifugal pump with a pressure regulating valve, and are now able to maintain uniform pressure at every building. The water is taken directly from the stand-pipe to the high pressure pump. The stand-pipe serves as a reservoir, but some lime in the future we should plan to make a large under-ground reservoir which would enable us to accumulate water during the hours that the demand is smallest. In this way it will not be necessary to pump our wells so hard. The old part of the boiler house, which houses everything but the boilers, must have a new roof. This roof is very old and has been patched from time to time for the last 10 years and is beyond repair. The members of the Board are familiar with this building and will understand what i. I mean when I say that the walls should be built up to a uniform height before the new roof is put on. 1 1 it is found that the expense will be too great to bring this up to a level with the new portion of the building, we may work out ;i place to stop at a lower level. For a considerable time we have been very badly crowded in the sewing room, and since this is a very important department of the Institution, it has been evident to the Board and to myself that some arrangements must be made to enlarge it. We have recently con - sidered the matter of putting the sewing room in the lower south dormitory of our New Girls' Cottage. This would be a splendid loca - tion, well lighted and well ventilated. Some of our old power sew - ing machines are worn out and it will be necessary to purchase per - haps 8 or 10 new ones. The sewing room is more than a paying proposition and we can well afford to equip it with every facility for doing a large amount of work. To compensate for the loss of this dormitory space, the Board has decided to utilize some space in the attic of this new building, large enough for 20 beds as sleeping quarters for the girls who work </seg>
            <seg id="p028">m the sewing room. This will be insulated and ventilated, and we expect that we can make it comfortable both m winter and m sum - mer. The 1935 Legislature created the Nebraska Commission for the care of the feeble-ninded. This commission is composed of the Superintendent of tl c Institution for Feeble-Minded, the Attorney- General and the Cha rman of the Board of Control, and provides for Ihe enumeration and a continuative census of all feeble-minded per - sons m the State of Nebraska, outside of this Institution. It also provides that marria. je licenses shall not be issued to any person who has been found to be feeble-minded and whose name appears on the list hi the Commission, unless at least one of the contracting parties is known to have be&lt; n rendered sexually sterile. It is expected that this Commission will m the near future make plans to carry out the intentions of this lav. Already some reports are coming m from out m the state. Our 10 ton ice n achine has been removed to the boiler house and two cold storage rooms, 18 x 23 ft., have been built m connection with this building, al so a large brine tank with 100 ice cans installed. The total cost of all material amounted to $3,009.05. All of the labor including the luilding of the brine tank, the making up of all the coils and the cc instruction and insulation of the cold storage room, has been done with our own help. This provides excellent cold storage facilities and will make it possible for us to have all the ice needed, and at the same time will enable us to butcher hogs and cattle and have a place to hang the meat. One of the cold storage rooms will be used by the Steward for dried fruit, cereal, etc. A splendid new hay barn was built to replace the one that was destroyed by fire. This hay barn is 110 x6O ft. and the total cost of material was $1,9:7.80. The necessity for new machinery m our laundry has been ur - gent for many montis. I am pleased to note that the Legislature has appropriated $1 2,000.00 for this purpose. This will be little enough m fact, but t is all that we asked for and we are hopeful that with the install; tion of this machinery we will be able to take care of the laundry york of the Institution until such time as it will be possible to get other needed machinery. Thd year 1934 \ras marked by a total failure of all garden and 23 </seg>
            <seg id="p029">field crops. This has necessitated the purchase of all food stuffs for our increasing population, and all feed for our dairy herd and live stock. Since the crop failure has been general, we have been compelled to pay high prices for everything we bought. All of this, when considered m connection with the fact that our maintenance appropriation has been less than at any time since 1925, has made it necessary for us to practice the utmost economy, but our inmates have been well fed and properly cared for, and our dairy herd has been maintained at a high standard of efficiency. The upkeep of the Institution m general has not been neglected, but many desirable and necesary improvements have been deferred on account of lack of funds. In previous reports, I have been asking for an appropriation to enlarge our school building, but the general financial depression and the complete crop failure have made it impossible to get an ap - propriation for this purpose. Our school is a very essential part of the Institution, and provision should be made for expansion to keep pace with the growth of the Institution. But we are getting most excellent results from the facilities we have, and will look forward to the time when we may expand enough to meet our needs. I am deeply grateful to the members of . the Board of Control for their splendid interest and support m handling the many prob - lems connected with the management of the Institution. To tin - assistants, heads of departments, and all other employees I have nothing but praise for duties well clone. Respect full}', J. A. EURFORD, i . Superintendent. 24 </seg>

            <seg id="p044">To the Governor an 1 the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the honor to submit herewith the Twenty-First Biennial Report of the Girls' Training School for the period beginning July 1, 1933 and ending Jur e 30, 1935. In looking back over the past two years we recognize both fail - ure and success, but taken as a whole, we feel' that much has been accomplished and that we have a great deal for which to be thankful. The general he; lth of the girls has been very good. We were fortunate enough to escape the contagiops diseases which were so prevalent last year There were no surgical operations and only one girl who had to be cared for m the hospital, and this for only 18 days. The total number sick or injured during the period was 781, this in - cludes colds, headaches, injured fingers, and all other ailments. All j^ivl are given a phys cal examination as soon as they enter the School and where treatmen is needed, it is begun at once and continued as long as needed. The general mo -ale has been good. Very few disciplinary cases have arisen, and these seem minor when we consider the conditions under which some o ! the girls have lived. We aim to have a full program for every girl, realizing that there is nothing that contributes more to happiness and contentment than well occupied ] lands and minds and well nourished bodies. Where possible we encourage every girl to attend the academic classes until she has finished high school. The}' have become so im - bued with this idea r nd with the desire to have the pretty dresses and lake an active part m commencement that we have practically no trouble to keep up the interest m the school work. During this biennium 33 girls fi lished high school. We hope this y :ar to add a full-time Home Economics teacher. During the past yer r we have had a qualified teacher m charge of the food departmen at Fanny Crosby cottage, and a few girls were 39 </seg>
            <seg id="p045">40 able to take the course. If we can have a teacher who can devote her entire time to this work, it will mean much to all of the girls. The music department has done very good work, it has not only made it possible for the girl with musical talent to develop that talent, but it has contributed a great deal of pleasure to all, and has stimulated a greater appreciation for good music. The Glee Club and Orchestra have given some very good entertainments. Each Sunday morning at 8 :30 o'clock A. M. the girls gather in the auditorium and 30 minutes are spent in singing. The Glee Club and Orchestra furnish special numbers. After this the girls all pass to the class rooms and one hour is spent in the study of the Interna - tional Sunday School lesson. At 3 :30 o'clock P, M. one of the ministers from Geneva conducts the chapel services At 7 :00 o'clock P. M. Christian Endeavor meetings are held in each living room. These meetings are conducted by one of the girls. During the school year there are a number of clubs, Knighthood of Youth, Loyalty and 4-H, which are greatly enjoyed by the girls, and we feel that a great deal of good is derived fom them. During the past biennium it has been increasingly difficult, owing to the scarcity of employment, to find suitable homes for our girls when they are ready to leave the school. The first consideration in selecting a home is the moral standard and home atmosphere. Our girls are young, and the environment into which they go is a most important thing in their development. The type of home which we seek is the home where a real interest is taken in the welfare of the girl and in which she is made a member of the family, where some supervision is exercised over her associates and recreation, and where the family cooperates with the School in promoting the best welfare of the girl. Effort is made to understand the girl and to know her family. As soon as she can do so after the girl's admission to the school, our Field Representative pays a visit to the girl's home and to reputable persons in her community who have taken an interest in the girl so that we may know her background and understand the causes which led to her failure to adjust herself in her own home and community. All through the period of training this interest is carried on, and in many cases a suitable home is ready for the girl when she is ready to leave the school. Girls who are placed, are under the supervision of the Field Representative, and are visited as often as time and finance permit. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">Girls located near the school are visited frequently, while those lo - cated at a distance are, of a necessity, visited less frequently. In visiting, the work is coordinated so that a maximum of visits may be made at a minium c?st. Many times, through no fault of the girl, it is necessary to change her location and return her to the school until another home can he found. Our girls are p aced all over the state, and at this time we have two placed m South Dakota. During the bie mium 194 visits were made to girls, the homes of 94 girls were visi :ed and 289 other visits were made m the interest of the girls. Because of the drouth last year, we were unable to do our usual amount of canning. Fortunately with the little that we were able to do and what we had carried over from the previous year, we had plenty to last through the winter.. We still have 400 gallons of canned tomatoes. Our poultry re urns were not as good as they have been some years, but did furnish an egg per day per capita, for both girls and employees, and $2,2?0.48 worth were sold, and 4,123 chickens con - sumed. The dairy depa rtment has furnished plenty of milk and cream, and from October 1, 1934 to July 1, 1935, 4,030 pounds of butter was churned. The girls have milk and butter each meal, and ice cream very often. During the past two years we have purchased but $218.00 worth of meat, the rest ha /ing been produced at the school. The girls have i aken an active part m producing and caring for all of this, and we consider it an important part of their training. Most of our Rej air and Replacement appropriation was spent on the old original bui ding which was erected m 1892. A new roof was put on, the buil ling rewired, and electric fire alarm installed. A water softene • which furnishes soft water for the laundry was installed. Another much leeded improvement was made m the building of a cave.

            <seg id="p056">To the Governor and the Board of Control of Stale Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the hono ■ of submitting the institution's 24th biennial report ending June 30, 1935. This report covers the movement of Our population and our farm products. Our population ias decreased somewhat because of the death of Civil War Veterans, their wives and widows. Owing to the drc ught it has been a trying biennium. All of the crops that have been raised were due to the irrigation wells, and we feel that m the near i uture we should have the entire section so that it may be irrigated as the cost per acre is very small compared with what can be raised if we have plenty of water. A splendid piece of work has been done at our cemetery, with the help of Federal \id, at a very small cost to the state. It has been re-graded and t le monuments have been re-aligned and reset, and the whole ccmetc ry has been replotted and landscaped. A very adequate water syst&lt; m has been installed. I would like to call your attention to the savings we have made m our laundry department this last year from by-products of our institution. In the )ear of 1933 the cost of soap for the laundry was $940.00. This ; 'ear we have been making our soap at a cost of but $65.00, which lid the same amount of work as did the $940.00 worth of soap. We have produc jd and slaughtered all of the pork that has been used here during tl c biennium. Late last fall we built a fine, modern, sanitary slaughter house and also a small smoke house, which has been agr ;at saving owing to the processing tax. Since the erection of the smoke house we have cured and smoked 4,300 pounds of hams and bacon. At a recent inspection by Colonel C A: Neves, of the National Homes Service, he nade a report of which we quote m part as 51 </seg>
            <seg id="p057">follows: "The dining rooms are adequate as to size and are kept m a clean and sanitary manner. There are five dining rooms and kitchens and it would seem that better service could be had and ;i more economical cost if there was a central dining room for the domiciliary members and one for the hospital patients. The refriger - ation units here are the ice-box type, and are not modern. How - ever, they seem to be satisfactory and were clean. The different food st!irjii seem to be properly segregated. The food is of good quality anu^sumcient quantity, and the members seem to be well cared for and the general morale of the members and employees is excellent." It would bciinjust if I failed to mention the fine cooperation of the citizens of Grand Island and especially the city officials. At this time I wish to thank each and every one of the officers and em - ployees for their splendid service rendered. To the I&gt;oard of Con - trol I wish to express my thanks for their patience, cooperation, counsel and advice. Respectfully submitted, IVAN S. GALLANT,' Commandant. 52 </seg>

            <seg id="p067">62 To the Governor and the Board of Control of Stale Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. It is an honor to present the biennial report of the Soldiers and Sailors' Home at Milford, Nebraska, covering the period from July 1, 1933 to June 30, 1935. Owing to the lack of funds we have been unable to make any marked showing in the matter of improvements to buildings and premises, having confined ourselves to the maintenance of the Home. Due to the practice of strict economy at all times, we have been able to close the past biennium without a deficit. At the outset of the past biennium we availed ourselves of the facilities of the Federal CVVA and made the following improve - ments; changed the course of Coon Creek; extended the sewer line; made repairs in the boiler room and improvments at the dairy and. horse barns and shingled the roof of the Lincoln Building and the porch of the Culver Building. During 1934 the water situation was somewhat improved by the addition of another well on the premises. With still another well in the immediate vicinity of the new well, we will be able to discontinue the use of the well located one and one-half miles distant. The good conditions that exist at the Hospital bespeak the effi - ciency of our surgeon and nursing staff, whose untiring efforts have brought relief and comfort to all in their charge. The Harrison Drug Act is being complied with in every detail. The morale of the Home is exceptionally good. The members are well fed and clothed, and everything within reason is being done to add to their contentment and comfort. To substantiate the above statement, I am quoting Col. Carl A. Neves who inspected the Home July 30, last : "The members art: well fed and cared for and the general morale of the members and employees is excellent. The discipline is good. This Home does not detail the members for any kind of work. The several kitchens and dining rooms were clean and kept in sanitary condition. The. refrigeration boxes seemed to be sufficient for the needs of the Home, however, most of them were of the old ice box type. The food furnished members is of good quality and a sufficient quantity, and is well prepared and served in a satisfactory manner." To the Governor, the Board of Control and the officers and em - ployees of the Home I owe a debt of gratitude for their patience, advice, cooperation and support, and in return I pledge my devotion and sincere loyalty to the duties of my office. Respectfully submitted, AUGUST B. WOELLHAF, Commandant. </seg>

            <seg id="p078">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I hereby present to you the Biennial Report for the Hastings Slate Hospital, covering the period from July 1, 1933 to June 30, 1935. The changes m the Medical Staff during the biennium have been only few. The American Psychiatric Association advocates one doctor to every one hundred and fifty patients, or one to every forty admissions, not inckding the superintendent or his assistant. Since we had only four pi ysicians for over 1,500 patients, it was thought advisable to employ m additional physician, perferably one who had received some training m psychiatry. For this purpose, Dr. M. M. Campbell was added to the staff on October 10, 1933. He resigned April 7, 1934 to accept an appointment at the Hartford Retreat, ■ Hartford, Connecticut, at a considerable increase m salary. This vacancy was filled by Dr. E. S. Post on May 14, 1934, who also had some training m psychiatry, and he resigned October 22, 1934 to accept an appointment with the Veterans Bureau at a considerable increase m salary. We learned that it was impossible to obtain physicians trained m psychiatry and retain them for the salary that we were paying. Following the approval of our hospital by the American Medical Association for residency m psychiatry, Dr. A. H. Fcchner was accepted as a resident m psychiatry on July 15, 1934. Dr. H. H. Stretton resigned on March 14, 1935 and we therefore, at the end of the biennium, had two vacancies on our staff. Dr. Jacob Peters, who had been the resident dentist of the in - stitution since November 21, 1923, unfortunately took ill m the spring of 1934, and passed away October 17, 1934. During his ill - ness, the emergency work was done by Dr. A. T. MacCashland of Hastings. Dr. Donald A. Keys was accepted as resident dentist on February 1, 193. i. The long faithful service of Mr. Peter Thordsen as male super - visor and Mrs. Libbie G. Thordsen as matron were discontinued at the end of the biennium. Mrs. Hallie Cox, who had been chief cook and assistant matroi, took over the duties of the matron, assisted by our dietitian, Miss Winifred Yates. 73 </seg>
            <seg id="p079">The ward service was simplified and reorganized by the appoint - ment of Miss Emma Dingman as director of nursing and supervisor of the men's as well as the women's wards. She is assisted by Miss Lenore Sportsman, in addition to a supervisor for each building. During this biennium, this hospital has also been approved by the American College of Surgeons. Because of the extreme re - ductions in salaries, it has been very difficult to retain experienced and trained help. Another form of remuneration was given In - instituting a post-graduate course in psychiatry for graduate nurses and also lectures and instruction for undergraduates and attendents. Ten nurses finished this course after six months of study. It is our intention to continue to offer a post-graduate course in psychia - try for nurses, provided that the course is accredited by the State Hoard of Nursing Education. The overcrowded condition of our wards, which was present at the begining of the biennium, has persisted, but further overcrowd - ing has not been permitted. An increase in tuberculosis, among especially our chronic patients, has necessitated the setting aside of one ward for men afflicted with active tuberculosis. The econo - mic situation during this biennium has added to the difficulty in try - ing to care for the patients that should have entered the institution. In many? cases it has been necessary for the counties to provide for the care of their patients in private homes or private sanitariums. The patients admitted have been selected from the waiting list as far as possible in accordance with the statutes covering this situation. The crowded condition, the necessity of creating vacancies in the institution so as to be able to receive new patients, made it es - sential to engage a psychiatric social service worker and to institute an out-patient department. Miss Grace Buckley thus became the first trained psychiatric social service worker connected with state institutions in Nebraska. Many patients were sent out on parole at a time when it was necessary to continue their supervision in the communtiy and for them to return to the hospital for interviews at various times. In addition many patients in the community who would have been committed to the institution had there been room, were permitted to come to the hospital for psychiatric interviews and treatment, and were enabled to remain in the community. This work could not possibly be done without a trained psychiatric so - cial worker. Our experience in the past two years has made us believe thai when we once catch up on our building program for the number of patients that are under our care, the natural increase in the popu - lation can be held at a minimum by increasing treatment facilities and more extensive psychiatric social service. An attempt has been made by the members of the stall to con - tribute to the information of the general public as well as of the medical profession of our state concerning the nature of mental dis - 74 </seg>
            <seg id="p080">orders. Members oi the staff have given talks on various aspects of mental hygiene to the various organizations which have given periods of study to tint subject under the direction of Dr. C. E. Wal - ton of the Departmert of Psychology at the University of Nebraska. They have generously addressed church and civic organizations. Several civic organz; tions have been permitted to hold banquets at the institution without expense to the State. Several state conven - tions held m Hastings have been addresed on subjects related to institutional work. several medical meetings have been held at the institution. We have enjoyed splended cooperation from the me - dical profession as well as from the local community organizations. Following are the titles of the papers that have been read to medical organizations by the various doctors: "Etiology and M anagement of Post-Encephalitis — Parkinsonian Syndrome," given bj Dr. C. H. Farrell to the Adams County Med - ical Society m September, 1933. "Treatment of Paresis In the State Hospital," given by Dr. C. H. Farrell to the Ad ims County Medical Society m February, 1934. "Extra Mural I sychiatry," given by Dr.M. M. Campbell to the Adams County Medi:al Society m February, 1934. "Intra Mural V sychiatry," given by the writer to the Adams County Medical Society m February, 1934. "Psychiatry Yesterday and Today," given by the writer to the Gage Count\- Medic; 1 Society m April, 1934. "When You an Committed," given by the writer to the) Ninth and Tenth Consular District Medical Meeting at Kearney, m June, 1934, and to the Red Willow County Medical Socity m August, 1934. "Observations On Epilepsy," given by Dr. C. R. Laird to the Adams County Medical Society m May, 1935. "The Need of Well Qualified Nurses In Our Mental Hospitals In Nebraska," give i by the writer to the District Nurses' Con - vention, Omaha, m May, 1935. "Organic Factors In Functional Mental Diseases," given by Dr. A.ll. Fechner to t ic Republican Valley Medical Society m June, 1935. Improvements have been made along many lines. A beaut)' parlor has been added and is being operated especially for the lady patients showing depressive reaction. The recreational work under Mrs. Cecil Casler has also made improvements. A cabin has been built m a cool and shady spot on the farm, and this is being constantly utilized during the summer time by patients' pi :nics and lias become indispensable as a recrea - tional outlet for the patients of our institution. 75 </seg>
            <seg id="p081">Our farm has functioned as usual, but our dairy herd is yet too small for our needs. The total crop failure of non-irrigated fields last year has, of course, increased our cost of maintenance. Ac - curate tabulations of the cost of irrigation was done last year, and it definitely showed large net profits ranging $10 to $600 per acre, even though our wells are 150 feet deep. Cheap power and a ready market for our produce insures this undertaking. A great loss to the institution was the burning of the Night Watches' Cottage on February 28, 1934. No lives were lost because it happened at night. The night watches were accommodated on two wards which were evacuated by crowding the patients together as bees m a hive. Fortunately the new Employees' Building was al - most ready for occupancy at that time. We are thankful to the Legislature for making appropriation for a new Night Watches' Cot - tage during the coming biennium. The unsanitary and inadequate conditions m our kitchens, where work m the summer time is done at 120 degrees Fahrenheit, are also being remedied by the Legislature with an appropriation for a new kitchen addition. Our fresh sewage, which has been threatening the health of the community, was also remedied by an appropriation for a new sewage disposal plant. The fire hazards of the buildings m which 1,000 patients are lo - cated, has also been recognized by the Legislature and we are thank - ful for the small appropriation made for the beginning of the re - placement of these buildings. We regret that the Legislature failed to appropriate for ad - ditional quarters for our overcrowded population and for the new - cases which should be received. We also regret that it is not gener - ally realized that the cost of caring for insane patients who cannot be admitted to the state hospital for want of room, is exceedingly greater to the taxpayer of our state when the}- are cared for m county or private sanitariums, than if adequate quarters were con - structed at the state hospital. In conclusion, I wish to thank all of those who have visited our institution and who have interested themselves m institutional affairs to. bring about improvements m the patients' care as well as m the conditions under which we work.

            <seg id="p094">To the Governor and the P.oard of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebrasl a. I have the honor of submitting the Biennial Report of the Lincoln State Hospital for the period from July 1, 1933 to June 30, 1935. The Medical sta T remains as it was two years ago. The mem - bers of the staff have manifested a keen interest m their work, and efforts directed to the restoration of patients through modern treat - ment have been quite vigorous. Religious services are held each Sunday afternoom Rev. Thomas A. MaxwellJ our regular chaplain, conducts the services, and the hour of chapel service is most profitable. In addition to this, each Saturday morning the Priest visits the hospital and conducts Mass for the Catholijc patients who are able to attend. The Christ - ian Science people also hold services each Wednesday afternoon for their patients. All [of these services help the patients religiously and also m a psychological manner. Amusements have been carried on as usual during this period. On Saturday afternoons the talking pictures are given, each Friday night a patients' dance is given, besides these, occasional entertain - ment is secured through the University Players and others. In addition to this entertainment we have telephone radios on twelve different wards. These have been a very great source of amusement, entertainment and joy to our patients. We feel that the radio is one of the best things we have tried to quiet the disturbed mind and spread influence throughout the institution. It makes the patients feel that they arc not shut-ins, but are living m the world at large. We have seven croquet sets for the female patients and they seem to enjoy this jgame very much. We have noted that it has helped their mentality a great deal, and some patients who would sit continually and talk to imaginary people have ceased this and are now playing croquet. The men enjoy daily baseball on the lawn. On holidays we have some sort of entertainment, usually music and extra dinners. At Christmas time many of our patients receive packages of | eatables and presents, and the hospital takes on a holiday air which seems to have a good effect on the patients. 89 </seg>
            <seg id="p095">90 On the Fourth of July we have an entertainment on the lawn for the patients. Most of them take pleasure in entering the contests, races, etc., and winner of each event receives a prize. A number of our patients are taken to the State Fair each year and some of them look forward to this occasion witli great interest and seem to enjoy it very much. The last two years we have taken about seventy-five men to a football game each fall between the Uni - versity and some other good team. The Athletic Department has kindly admitted them free. We have some patients who have en - joyed this more than anything else during the year. Due to the extreme dry weather the farm and garden have not been very successful during the years of 1933 and 1934, but the gar - den looked very good up until the first of July of this year, and we have had a great deal of good from it. However, it depends on the weather from July on as to what the garden and other crops do for us this year. Sewing and various other domestic duties about the institution provide occupational pursuits for our female patients. The sewing room proves most useful in the making of clothing and bedding for the institution. We usually have about fifteen patients in the art room who do fancywork, furnishing the institution with table covers, etc. These patients make from thirty to thirty-five pieces a month. We have a showcase in the center office containing fancywork to be sold to the public and we take many pieces to the State Fair fur dis - play and sale. The carpenter shop, shoe repair and mattress shop, furniture repair shop, paint shop, farm, garden, engine room, laundry, poultry farm, dairy, greenhouse and lawn provide occupational pursuits for male patients. Because of having certain tasks to perform, patients are happier and in many instances actually improve mentally. We regard these industrial pursuits as one of our most potent therapeutic agents. The $30,000.00 appropriated by the Legislature four years ago for the repairing of the Main Building and making it fireproof has been used and the work has been completed. It is a great improve - ment, especially as a preventative to fires. We now have six fire walls in the building reaching from the ground to the roof, and lire doors in each wall. These walls are in the middle of each ward and one on each side of center. This arrangement has been arrived at with the feeling that if a fire should break out in any one of the departments, the fire doors could be used and the patients moved to the other end of the ward where they would be safe. This work has been a great improvement to the lower wards, A-l and F-l also. These wards as they now exist are practically fireproof throughout and are now two of our nicest wards, where before they were almost uninhabitable. </seg>
            <seg id="p096">The 1933 Legislature appropriated $15,000.00 for equipment for the laundry. This appropriation has been used and the equip - ment installed. It is a great help to the institution m the way of get - ting out the laundry, jis the old machinery was worn out and it was quite impossible to service the institution. The Legislature appropriated $25,000.00 to build an ell onto the Hospital building, which was insufficient to complete the work. The Hoard of Control acquired a government grant to help complete the fell. The construction is completed at this time but the wards are not occupied as yet, c}n July 1, 1935. We now have $60,000.00 to take care of the water supply and irrigation for the garden, which we feel will be very adequate. On August 23, 1933 we changed the heating of this institution from coal to gas, having installed the gas burners m the different boilers, and this has been very satisfactory. The Legislature jof 1935 has convened and adjourned, but we are copying part of tlhe recommendations that we made on our An - nual Report last year' m order that you might again note that we are badly m need of thefsame things, excepting the $10,000.00 for the water supply and pumps. The institution is very crowded, more so, I think, than at any time for the past several "years. It is necessary to put beds down m the day halls for k'orty-rive patients. These patients are not ex - actly sleeping on thd Hoor, but sleeping on cots and mattresses that are "placed on the lloir. We feel that $125,000.00 should be approp - riated for a cottage or women, which we would hope to hold about 100 women of the chronic class. If this could be received it would enable us to turn the ward A-l, which holds about forty-five patients, back to the male side of the house and make room for forty-five more men. We also need a night watches' cottage, as the night watches are now using and haVe been using for several years, a ward on the male side where w: could keep about thirty-four patients. This would necessitate aii appropriation of $40,000.00. This cottage and the women's cottage| would provide room for both men and women patients. In addition we feel that there should be a building for the enm - ihai insane and it seems rather logical that it should be placed at this institution, as it is i l close proximity to the prison and the reform - atory This item is of interest to the three state hospitals for the insane the prison and the reformatory. I have no estimate of the cost of a building oi this character, but of course it would cost more than an ordinary building for patients, and I am placing the amount at $150,000.00. These items arc all needed very badly on account of the crowded condition which exists at this time. 91 </seg>
            <seg id="p097">We have felt for some time past that we should have a fence around the institution, m front as well as on the other sides of the campus. The grounds are used as a public park and automobiles are going through at any time of the night or day, and we are unable to check this without the fence. It is very important to have a fence - on account of the safety of the patients and m order that we may know more about who is coming m and going from the institution, as well as what they are taking with them. This fence would call for an appropriation of $10,000.00. I wish to thank his Excellency, the Governor, and the Honorable Members of the Board of Control for their courteous consideration and for the confidence, kind assistance and advice they have uni - formly extended to me throughout the biennium ; also the officers and employees associated with me who have been loyal and faithful during the biennium. Respectfully submitted, D. G.GRIFFITHS, M. D. Superintendent. 92 </seg>

            <seg id="p116">To the Governor aid the Board of Control of Stale Institutions, Lincoln, Nebra ;ka. 1 have the honor of presenting herewith the Twenty-third Biennial Report of the Norfdk State Hospital, for the period ending June 30, 1935. The needs of t le Hospital will merely be mentioned m this re - port and will be tak :n up m detail m our next Annual Report, which you will receive dining the coming summer, before the convening of OUT Legislature. We have been extremely fortunate regarding the health of our patients during the past two years m having an unusually good health record throughout the Institution. There have been no epidemics among either the p; tients or the employees. We began the biennium with an overcrowded Institution, and every effort has bee l made to limit the admissions to the younger and acute cases who we felt could be benefited somewhat by treatment, ami to those who fi rnished histories of being violent and too danger - ous to be kept at 1 ome. In consequence, our admissions were de - creased, and the m mber of patients discharged does not average as high as heretofore, due to the restricted number admitted. In reviewing the work of the last two years I consider it has been characterized by a steady progress from a medical standpoint, as to the care and treatment of the patients. Though handicapped by overcrowded conditions which we have mentioned m previous reports, good worl:, with some very pleasing and encouraging re - sults has been atts ined. This work is the principal business of a State Hospital, and all the other activities m the Institution occupy suborinate position;, except insofar as they contribute to the welfare of the patients. "'Ye arc likewise getting away from the narrow technical definition of the word 'insanity,' ami view the cases from the standpoint of ; djustment. The function of the Hospital is not simply that of custodial care; its principal object is to serve as a Hospital for these unfortunate citizens of the State of Nebraska 111 </seg>
            <seg id="p117">who through mental diseases, or otherwise, find themselves out of adjustment with their environments, and with this in mind we are endeavoring, with all the resources that are at hand, to make a Hos - pital for such, in service as well as in name. One of our very useful activities in the way of occupational therapy, and one which heretofore has materially assisted in low - ering our cost of maintenance of the Institution, has been the farm, dairy and garden departments. These departments have been very active the past two years. Untiring work has been done in the farm and gardens, but due to the extreme dry weather they have not been able to produce the usual crops. This, of course, has increased our cost of maintenance. The dairy department continues to improve until at this time we are informed that we have one of the best large dairy herds in the United States. During the last year a new laundry building has been finished. It is expected that we will be able to occupy this building within a few months. This new building replaces one of our oldest original buildings, and has been very badly needed. Outside of the new - laundry building very little construction w6rk lias been done, due to the lack of appropriations for such purposes! There is much repair work, painting, etc. to be done, and we cannot help but feel that it is poor business judgement on the part of the Legislature to over - look needs of this kind. At this time it might be well to call your attention to some of the important needs to be considered by the Board of Control for the coming Legislature. Inasmuch as our Hospital is filled to over - capacity and we have a waiting list of from twenty-five to thirty patients, it would seem that our most urgent need will be buildings for the care of patients. As already indicated, we are overcrowded to the degree that not only is the general physical health of the patients endangered, but the proper care and treatment of our mental cases is not satisfactory. . , In the years gone by in several of my reports to the Board I have recommended a special tax levy for remodeling old buildings and making additions, as well as the construction of new buildings. Such a tax to raise a fund sufficient for this purpose would increase the present tax levy but a very small amount. The tax for this pur - pose could be limited to four or six years, in which time the Institu - 112 </seg>
            <seg id="p118">tions will have beer caught up with their building program. It would be advantageous to the taxpayers and the Institutions if it were possible for tin; Board of Control to have sufficient funds to plan and carry on a building program over a period of years. Such a bill was introduced m the last session of the Legislature, and I sincerely hope that tie Board might see fit to sponsor a bill of this type for the coming Legislature. If this is not done Nebraska will find herself like a nunber of other states have found themselves — so far behind m their building program that drastic action becomes necessary. In a number of states it has been necessary to vote a special bond issue to catch up with the building program, while other states who are more progressive, are mapping out a four to six year building plan m advance and voting taxes for this purpose. I sin - cerely hope that you will give serious consideration to this recom - mendation, and that you may see fit to ask for a special levy for the purposes above ment oned. In ihe report o 1936 it will be essential that we very nearly follow out (jur recoinmenditions made to you for the 1935 Legis - lature, inasmuch as no appropriations were made for us, with the exception of a new well and pump. Our recommendations will probably 1 include a tarm cottage, night watch cottage, store room, barns, and additions to female ward buildings. The recom - mendations for the power plant will depend greatly upon the course that the Board will recommend m the way of changing our present system from a direct current to an alternating current. From all information 1 have I een able to gather, it would seem that this will be the most reasonable, thing to do, and if the Board does see fit to make such a recomm ;ndation, I hope to have information and figures for you as to the cos : of such a change, during the coming year. In concluding tUs report I desire to express my grateful appre - ciation of the support and cooperation given me by the officers and employees of the Hcspital, and especially I wish to thank the Board of Control for the unfailing kindnesses they have shown to me at all times, and for their consultations and support. Respectfully submitted, G. E. CHARLTON, M. D. Superintendent. 113 </seg>

            <seg id="p134">To the Governor ai d the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. Midway between the Atlantic and Pacific, on both sides of the Lincoln Highway, two miles west of the outstanding city of Kearney, spreads the 602 ace farm of Nebraska's "Industrial School" for boys. This farm, its workers, teachers, tradesmen, shops and schools are devoted to the highest interests of the state's delinquent boys committed heie by the County and District Judges to be re - directed, encourage 1, trained and paroled into the ranks of good Americans. The ages of these boys are from 8 to 21 years. Tn school work these boys are educated m the grades 1 to 10 in - clusive. Business ; rithmetic, bookkeeping and typing are taught m (he business school. Vocational education m its larger meaning includes the major part of all educational activities. In its practical application, it is m contradistinction to academic education, a teaching of trades, of various' industrial c perations, including theory and technique, with resulting precision ;ml skill acquired through actual practice. This vocational educatioi has a strong appeal to the boy. He utilizes both his physical and mental abilities. The results obtained are im - mediately and visibly realized. Discovery has shown that the boy who has made himself an annoyance m the academic school, proved himself a help and ; success m the vocational class. The school boy who annoyed, sometimes became a truant, then a delinquent. Vo - cational education proves itself a preventive to delinquency. In this school we believe n vocational education as a corrective agency. The skill and knowledge gained while a boy is pursuing a trade m this school will sometimes cause him to deprecate crime and to seek a useful career. Cooperation with fellow workmen, pride m good workmanship, cons deration for the rights and property of others, respect for authority, ability to assume responsibility, are admirable qualities taught through carefully organized vocational training m this State Industrial School. Our discipline s based upon the merit system. Each boy is re - quested to earn 18 000 credits, then he may go into the world on parole. The credits are earned daily by good work, study and be - havior. The numb :r earned daily is 30. By special effort the boys earn extra credits tl ereby earning parole more quickly. By this plan the boy determines to a marked degree, the number of months he 129 </seg>
            <seg id="p135">will spJnd in the institution. Three months before the time of a parole tlie Parole Officer endeavors to find a desirable home for the boy to enter when the time for parole arrives. The School's beautiful orchard of 800 fruit trees commands the attention of passing tourists ami interested neighbors. Fresh fruits have been received from these trees and the vines interspersed among them. The boys' of the two institution kitchens have care - fully canned the fruits and berries until the dining tables have pro - vided 14,668 quarts of luscious jams, fruits, desserts and pickles. The health of the boys has been very good. As a rule, tin - longer a boy remains in the school the stronger and more robust he becomes. In the past 24 months we have lost no boy by death, and have suffered no couatgious diseases. Many bovs who come to the institution pale and undernourished, leave 16 months later strong, well and ready to take their physical places in the world with the ablest of young men. IS boys have had tonsils removed. I£vcry boy has had medical inspection, and physical handicaps have been corrected. Diets in the hospital have been properly controlled. The eyes of boys have been examined and 13 boys have been provided with glasses by the optometrist. The school's excellent dentist has cleaned, filled and extracted scores of teeth long sadly neglected. l&gt;lood tests have been taken and proper medical treatment adminis - tered by our able physician. The villgant care of an experienced nurse in our hospital has prevented epidemics. Clean athletic sports have been encouraged. Our boys are well and strong. The 190 boys daily cared for the past year in this school are di - vided into 5 companies, grouped as to age and size. Over each group of 38, one man — the cottage father, and one lady — the cottage matron — preside. Each boys' vocational fitness is studied. The following vo - cations or trades are afforded: poultry raising, broom making, car - pentering, cooking, laundering, mechanics, painting, printing, tailoring, shoe-making, gardening, dairying, and farming. By team work in athletics; properly organized competition: by careful parole supervision; by inspirational talks; by correct work relationships; by religious instruction in Sunday School and Church, Nebraska's Industrial School is earnestly attempting to build up a citizenship that will be a resource, not a liability, to the government of state and nation. Worthy citizenship and actual spirituality are the high ideals of this school. Our excellent gymnasium gives ample opportunities for indoor recreational programs. Football, baseball, soft ball, tennis and horseshoe-pitching provide outdoor sports regularly practiced and enjoyed by the boys. The Institution is very proud of its good band of 25 members. This band gives weekly concerts on Sunday evenings on the school campus at 7 :15 P. M., also plays for /airs, picnics and various community gatherings. Two singers who furnish special numbers 130 </seg>
            <seg id="p136">for the band conceits arc known as the "Cow Boy .Singers." The orchestra which consists of 10 members, furnishes music for our chapel services. Sate Industrial School Drum and Bugle Corps consists of 21 members, and furnishes drills and martial music for ■the band concerts. In the Trades Buildingj a large attractive dining room accom - modates all the boy &gt; of the School while they partake of their meals under the supervis on of two officers who assist each boy quietly and peacefully to enjoy his full share of healthful, wholesome food. The boys of tl is School are trained to practice correct habits, with the hope that t ley will continue the practice through life. Fre - qent bathing is demanded, also care of the teeth. Play is always supervised and enc&lt; uragecl. Ethical charac er is built by attendence of each boy at the weekly chapel service held each Sunday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock; by regular religious instruction given m the six Sunday school class - es: by the saying o; grace before meals; by evening prayers and by careful parole supervision. Truthfulness is fostered by material shortening of institution time when constancy m this virtue is re - corded. Developm ait of trust is promoted m like manner. ( &gt;ur boy agriculturalists, with 26 horses and 1 tractor, till the soil of the State's (02 acre farm. Achievement is real when a boy who was idle m tin city becomes thoroughly interested m farming, is paroled to a dirt farmer and takes up m a successful manner his work as a Xebrask i agriculturalist. This biennium the farm pro - duced 303 tons of s igar beets, 8,642 bushels of potatoes, 682 tons of alfalfa. 2.248 bushe sof corn and 400 tons of ensilage. 60 acres of garden provided \egetables valued at ! $ 10,588.73. 20 acres of orchard produced fruit m value $2,359.10.. This school is proud of its Holstein cattle, Spotted Poland China hogs and White Leghorn chickens. The Holsteins have furnished the boys and worke s of the school m two years with 104.441 gallons of fresh milk. Tin Poland Chinas have urnished 28,980 pounds of fresh pork for the tables and have brought cash to the School m the amount of $5,999.7/ . The Leghorns hay: added choice foods to the menus, furnishing Jf 1,921.00 m meat and 193,092 eggs. Our trees, our lawns and white buil&lt; ings are comforting to the eye. Sanitation is closely watched. Cleanliness is earnestly de - manded throughout the institution buildings and grounds. Heartily do I thank you, my coworkers, probation officers, judges and executive officers, for all aid, help and encouragement m this great work with boys. To the Hononble members of the lioard. of Control I express genuine thanks for systematic aid, helpfulness and cooperation. Respectfully submitted, R. V. CLARK, ! Superintendent. 131 </seg>
            <seg id="p137">REPORT OF THE PAROLE DEPARTMENT. Herewith is submitted the report of the Parole Department of the State Industrial School covering the work done during the two year period beginning July 1, 1933 and ending June 30, 1935. To place properly eligible boys on parole and thereafter to su - pervise their conduct to the extent that they may continue in the excellent training and development received in the school, are the aims and duties of the parole department. During the two year period 249 boys were placed on paroles ; 219 in homes throughout the state and 30 in homes out of the state. Of the 249 boys paroled, 198 were in the school for the tirsl time, 49 were here for the second time and 2 were here for the third time. 35 boys were paroled by order of the Board of Pardons, and one boy was transferred to another institution by the order of the Hoard of Control. A case record is kept of each boy entering the institution. The day a boy enters the school a history of his home, his home surround - ings and home conditions is begun. All available information is gained concerning the boy's home through county officials, welfare workers and others interested in this work. Long before a boy is ready to go on parole the parole department has a record of the gen - eral home conditions. Several weeks before a boy actually leaves the school the parole officer makes a final investigation of the home and completes the parole arrangement with the boy's parents or parties who assume the responsibility of the parole. This final ar - rangement is carried on by a personal visit to the boy's home where the exact prerequisites and future parole conditions can be investi - gated. Many handicaps are encountered, but an earnest effort is made to arrange the best possible parole for each and every boy pa - roled from the institutions. The depression during the last two years has made it difficult to secure suitable homes for boys eligible for parole. The economic conditions have made deep cuts in the number of suitable homes into which a boy can be paroled. The department is also confronted with the increased problem of how best to handle and supervise boys on parole in homes now unsatisfactory because of economic con - ditions. During the two year period 66 boys were placed in good farm homes. It is hoped, as farm conditions improve, more and more boys may be placed in good farm homes where they will be away from the temptations of the town and city. Good farm homes 132 </seg>
            <seg id="p138">are much m demand. Board, room and clothing, plus a limited amount of spending money, are all a boy can expect m a farm home at the present time. In fulfilling the duties of his office the parole officer has made 298 home investigate ons previous to the actual, paroling of the boys from the institution. A large percentage of the homes is found un - satisfactory for var ous reasons. Some homes are favorable, the parents are able to :are for their boy, but a system of supervised parole must be built jp within the home and the community m which a boy lives. Some homes are absolutely unsatisfactory. In these cases other responsible parties are relied upon to properly supervise the boy. By personal investigation a closer feeling of cooperation is built up between the parents of the boy and the school It is our earnest endeavor to permit no boy to be paroled into a home with - out a proper investi jation and the proper cooperation agreed upon by the parties assuming the parole responsibility. Valuable co - operation and assist nice has been received from the many county officials, county judges, sheriffs and welfare workers throughout the state. All have beer generous m their help. It is only through this splendid help and cooperation that many boys are kept on the right path and grow into good. citizens. Boys are placed on parole for a four month probationary period. At the end of this four month period the parole officer visits the boy, the boy's sponsor and any other individual interested m the boy, to ascertain the feasibility of establishing the parole on a permanent basis. 1 f the proper recommendations arc made by the parties inter - ested m the boy, ami the boy is making satisfactory progress, the parole is made perm merit and remains so until the boy is discharged from parole by age. Violations of the parole cause a boy to be re - turned to the institution. An individual parole officer is secured for all boys going on parole. It is the duty of this individual parole offi - cer to be helpful an 1 interested m the boy's apostrophe wefare, to endorse the monthly parole report, of the boy and to keep th parole department informer as to the boy's apostrophe welfare. Parole supervision of the boys on parole is handled by means of monthly reports, also interviews and visits by the parole officer. Each boy on parole nust report once a month. An additional fea - ture of the parole report has been added during the past year. Every boy on paroh , m addition to being paroled to a responsible party, must have a s ;cond sponsor or friendly advisor who will take an active interest m said boy. The second sponsor or friendly ad - visor interviews the boy at different intervals, endorses his monthly parole report before it is sent to the school, and acts as an added check on the boy m safeguarding his conduct and behavior. In such a manner a check is had of the boy m his home and the community m which he lives. In Omaha and Lincoln, city probation officers check each monthly "eport of boys paroled to their respective cities. 133 </seg>
            <seg id="p139">Such a plan, it is believed, will prove beneficial and cause a stricter adherence to the parole agreement of all paroled boys and thus re - sult m fewer parole violations. Boys on parole the first year must report monthly. After being on parole one year, quarterly reports are required. After being on parole two years, semi-annual reports are required until 21 years of age. When a boy fails to report, im - mediate inquiry is made by the parole officer as to the cause of fail - ure to report. Such a close check on each paroled boy has produced a marked decrease m parole violations, and lias proven helpful and beneficial to the boy on parole m his daily problems of life. In pursuit of his duties the parole officer has endeavored to in - terview and check on the paroled boys m n systematic manner. The vast extent of territory to be covered and the scattered location of homes throughout the state make this necessary. Each boy on pa - role should be interviewed at least every three months. During the past two years fully, seventy-live per cent of the boys on parole the first year have been interviewed. An added burden has been placed on the department during the past two years because of the un - settled economic conditions, causing many satisfactory homes lo be - come unsatisfactory through lack of work and suitable employment. In such cases new dispositions must be made of the boy. Many boys are transferred from such homes to more favorable homes. During the past two years the parole officer has traveled 29,813 miles m pursuit of his duties. All of these miles were traveled by auto, saving time and expense. There are 405 boys on parole from this school between the ages of 10 and 21 years. These paroled boys are located throughout the st:ite and a few m .surrounding states. The majority of these boys is on our active parole list, some on our inactive list, or among those required to report only at infrequent intervals. The duty of reporting is determined by the faithfulness and regularity of the boy on parole m making his designated report. Each year many of the "paroled boys reach 21 years of age and are automatically discharged. Kach year many newly paroled boys are added to this number. The work of parole rates m importance with the training at tin - institution.' Only by thorough follow-up work and efficient super - vision of boys on parole can the training and development at the institution be of permanent value. It is the desire and purpose of the parole officer to be ever helpful to the boys on parole, to keep a close check on all paroled boys and to see that all paroled boys live - up to their parole agreements. The following tables will outline the work of this department m detail : 134 </seg>

            <seg id="p150">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, . Lincoln, Nebraska. 1 herewith present the Eleventh Biennial Report of the Hospital for Tuberculous for the period ending June 30, 1935. During this biennium the institution has been filled at all times, with many awaiting admission. Our one and one-half to two year ruling has worked licely, and has been the means of admitting and caring tor more patients during this two year period than during any two years m our history. I feel that the results have been better, since the patient realizes his time is limited and of necessity must make the most of liis opportunity. In this length of time he should be much improved if improvable, and will have learned about the disease and its trea ment so that he can continue to care for himself at home, when sanatorium care is no longer needed. The medical \\ ork has been given special attention. We have given air to 41 cases, with 606 initial treatments and refills during the biennium. The ultra violet light treatment has been used on many cases, with a total of 2,961 treatments given. Eleven phrenic ex - ercises were done and 7 cases went to the University Hospital, one of these for thoracoplasty ; 3 bone cases; 1 skin cancer; 1 for hyster - ectomy; and one f:&gt;r a lung operation. We have had 10 cases of bronchiectasis, whirh we treated by posture drainage with good re - sults, and 2of these have had lipiodol. We have had 2 tubercular bone cases that required plaster casts and 2 cases with glandular in - volvement that necessitated treatment. Several surgical cases de - veloped that required care m the City Hospital as follows: 5 hemorrhoidectomies, 3 rectal fistulas, 4 appendectomies, 2 tonsill - ectomies, 1 unbilicil hernia, 1 hysterectomy, 1 theraputic abortion and 1 cancer of the duodenum. - ■ During a year and a half of the biennium, Dr. L. B. Hebard, a dentist, who had been a patient at this hospital, looked over the teeth of all our cases and did the necessary cleanings, extractions and fillings. This was of marked benefit to the patients. 145 </seg>
            <seg id="p151">Our laboratory work has been kept up. The doctors have had this in charge, but two patients have helped, one a trained laboratory worker and the other a graduate nurse. About 24,000 urine and the same number of sputum, examinations have been done. Other routine work has been carried out. We have done more x-ray work during the past year and have made improvements in our equipment by purchasing a new tube, Cassette, Buck diaphragm, timer, and fluoroscopic screen. Our field work under Mrs. Zulauf has been continued this year with even more systematic results and by next year we hope to have enough facts and have them tabulated for presentation. On January 15, 1935, Airs. Staubitz, our matron, who had been with us for over six years, resigned, and Mrs. Charlotte Kpkjer took her place. No other change has taken place in our officers in the past year and very few changes in the 'other help. We have kept up our ordinary repairs, plastering and painting. In addition to this we have made the i following improvements: we constructed a tunnel 400 feet long joining it to the Men's Building and running it to the Nurses Cottage, and are now installing steam, water lines, and lighting in it. This practically completes our tunnel system. We dug a new well several hundred feet south of the highway and connected it up with our present system with six inch cast iron water main, installed a new Pomona pump, put in two new fire plugs and made other changes in our water system. We excavated the west basement under our old East Sun Build - ing and put in cement floors, windows, stairs and partitioned it for storage. We also excavated a basement under the Children's Build - ing. We built a new brooder house for 400 baby chicks and are re - modeling the old one. We also replaced the roof on our chicken house, installed a metal "I" beam in the school room and two new front doors at the Men's Building. We laid some cement sidewalks and cement drains under the roads. We kept up the roads with new gravel. We have replaced wiring as needed. We have the material to make over the west center room at the Hospital, and will do this work when our rainy season is over. 146 </seg>
            <seg id="p152">In the boiler house we installed six tubes m a heating boiler and 25 tubes m a libt water tank, and worked over our automatic stoker ratchet. We purchased a reseater for valves. We covered 600 feet of pine m the old tunnels. We purchased 17 traps for radiators at the Nurses Cottage. Five ice cans and a belt for the ice plant and 200 feet o i fire hose were purchased. We had the inside of our water tank cleaned and painted. We installed a new "spider" m it as the old one had entirely rusted out. Our garden last summer was not as good as usual due to the ex - ceptionally dry season. We were able, however, to supply our tables fairly well with fresh vegetables and potatoes during the summer. We stored some carrots, cabbage, parsnips, salsify and sweet potatoes for winter use, and canned 2,967j4 quarts of fruit and vegetables. I desire to express my appreciation to various individuals, firms ami organizations that have given of their time and money for the good of our patient;. The World theatre continues to admit those of our patients who are able to attend the Tuesday afternoon picture show, free of charge. This is certainly a wonderfully thing for our patients. The Industrial School Band plays a concert on our lawn each Friday during the warmer months. Baumgartners Book Store supplies us with unsold copies of current magazines. Mr. Erickson, the florist, supplies us with flowers frequently. The Ministers of Kearney provide us with religious services without charge. At Christmas time many organizations send us presents for our patients. Many of our patients would have a dreary Christmas if it were not lor this. The organizations usually doing this are the P. E. 0., Sal - vation Army, with t ie aid of the Firemen, and organizations of var - ious churches. Many nice things, too numerous to mention, arc done by individuals Several school districts m the state also send tilings for Christmas. I wish too express my gratitude for the continued loyalty shown by all of the officers and employees at this institution. Tn concluding this report I wish to thank each member of the Board for the help and cooperation they have extended me m manag - ing the institution. I can assure you it is thoroughly appreciated. Respect full}' submitted, L. T. SIDWELL, M. D. Superintendent. ■ . ' - ■ . ' • ' .'■''' i 147 </seg>

            <seg id="p164">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. i herewith sutmit the Fifteenth Biennial Report of the-Ortho - pedic Hospital for the period ending June 30, 1935. The past two years', July 1, 1933 to June 30, 1935, have been active ones m respect to the number of patients who have received treatment m this hospital. I believe that more work has been accom - plished than for an ' like period m the history of the Orthopedic Hos - pital. Dining these two years, 289 new patients and 330 returned parole patients were admitted. There were 689 casts applied, 218 braces ordered am fitted, 1,902 observations of patients made, 878 X-rays taken and 125 surgical operations performed. Patients have seen admitted as soon as others could be released, and by doing so, a constant intake and outgo of patients has existed and thereby more ( an be cared- for m a given period of time. The personnel of the hospital has remained about the same, ex - cepting a few chai ges due to replacement by better help and by re - signations of sonic others who desired a change or secured better positions elsewhere. Miss Alice V. Gantzer has taken the place of Mrs. Tlielma Swift, resigned, m the physiotherapy department and has taken consider lble interest m her work. Mrs. Ann Johnson re - signed as surgical nurse and was replaced by Mrs. Charline Ferciot who had been employed by the Lincoln General Hospital. Miss Alice Meyer, nigh: supervisor, resigned and was replaced by Mrs. Gladys Fickess. 1 Irs. Naomi Grosball, day supervisor, was replaced by Miss Ruth Brehm. Owing to wage reductions, it will be more difficult to keep tl c best help at the same wages and especially so since more opportunities arise each day with the betterment of con - ditions at large. The past two years have been devoted to redecorating and re - pairing rooms, bui dings and roofs. Among the more important are the following: 159 </seg>
            <seg id="p165">A new wood shingle roof was placed over the south wing of the Administration building and repairing of .the roof and skylight of the Administration building was accomplished. The recently con - structed brick and cement garbage housq and two-stall garage fills a great need which has existed for some years. This was accomplished at very little cost. A much needed double tennis court was con - structed on the playgrounds and this has been a joy to the employees and patients alike and fills a great need for recreation and diversion. Some metal hospital equipment was badly needed and three new tray conveyors, an instrument table and a dressing cart were constructed by the hospital's own employees. By the aid of tray conveyors, food reaches the children m quicker time and m better condition. The nurse's home was repainted and almost all the rooms were redecor - ated, as well as the library room, boys and girls' wards, nurse aides' dining room, halls, etc. m the Administration building. Just recently the smoke stack to the boiler room was given two coats of paint. Besides painting and general cleaning up, the electric wiring was gone over and changes made to lessen the danger of fires. An ap - roved ironing room on the second and ground floors of the nurse's home was added, so as to eliminate the use of irons m the individual rooms. The recommendations of the chief fire inspector \yere car - ried out throughout the buildings. During the month of August 1933 the fire boxes under the boilers were changed from coal burn - ing types to gas burning equipment. This was a welcomed change. Fifteen new trees were set out on the hospital grounds to re - place older trees and some that had not survived. Some small shub - bery was changed about to make the grounds more attractive. An earnest effort has been put forth to keep the hospital grounds m presentable condition to the public and pleasant for the patients to view. I wish to acknowledge the gifts to the hospital by various clubs, societies, business houses and private individuals. The thoughtful - ness of others make it more pleasant for the children committed to our care. We are thankful to the Governor, State Legislature, Board of Control, and others who are concerned with the welfare of this in - stitution, for the appropriations and helpful acts m our behalf.

            <seg id="p194">Vo the Governor and Hie Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. We hereby si bmit the Twenty-fifth Biennial Report of the Neb - laska Industrial 3omc for the period beginning July 1, 1933 and ending June 30, 1)35. The work of the institution is divided into details of eight weeks i. tch. Every girl is given a different detail each time, which gives her good training m house-work, cooking, laundry, sewing, proper i are and feeding of infants, as well as having her become ac - customed to wbrurig separately and with a group. We consider this one of the important phases of our work with the girls, for it is necessary tl at she assumes the responsibility of her part m making the Hone a fine place to live. Most of the girls show marked improvement m their work and are really capable , upon leaving the Home, of earning a very good living if the}' are fortunate enough to find work. Each department is under the management of a supervisor, who is responsible for lot only the quality and quantity of work accomplished, but also lie general conduct of each girl under her care. Written repr rts are handed to the Superintendent once a week. )ur girls are gr.-.ded as to courtesy, judgment, accuracy, neatness, punctuality, efficiency, honesty and anything else that is found neces - sary to report, either commendable or otherwise. Each one hands n a written state nent concerning herself. All take pride m making jood records. We wish our girls to feel that each one builds her iwn record, and let her know that we have confidence m her doing ler very best at all times. One of the riost difficult problems that the girls face is whether &gt;r not they should keep their child. When they come to us for idvise, we have them get m touch with their people to learn what hey wish, then we work m harmony m this matter. We do not .lesire to antagonize m any way, the girl and her people. 189 </seg>
            <seg id="p195">We do not go out m search of homes for babes. The applica - tions that come to us are from those who have either known some - girl who has received care m the Home, or have learned from some - one who has had a child. We have made a very careful study of child placing, and each foster home is thoroughly investigaged, so that after a years' association with the mother, and the contacts with her people, we feel that we are better able to place the right child m the right home. Very few babes have ever had to be returned to the institution through mistaken placement. There is no fee whatever charged at the institution; the only expense the applicants have to meet is at the time of adoption, then the county places the amount and this fund goes to them. About fifty per cent of the babes born m the Home during this biennium have been legally adopted. In the religious training, our ambition is not to change the church or belief of any girl, but help her to become stronger m her own chosen faith. We have Sunday School, Young Peoples' Meetings, and weekly preaching services. The health of the population has been exceptionally fine, ami at no time since our association with the Home have we had so little illness, especially among the babes. We credit this to the fact that we are not taking the general public into nurseries, for many times illness such as colds have been traced to visitors. The mother herself, when she has a cold, must wear a mask when she cares for her baby. During the biennium the following improvements have been made : A 20x40 feet brooder house having two compartments, each with a Simplex brooder stove, has been constructed. The electric wiring had to be changed so that each building wired could be taken care of separately when any repairing is neces - sary, which now enables us to use all but the department affected. The milk room at the dairy barn has been equipped with double wash sink, a steam table, rack for milk pails, table for milking machine and separator parts, cabinet, and the walls painted. This has been a wondeful improvement, it has simplified to a great degree the work of caring for the milk and milking utensils The water tower has been cleaned and painted two coats in - side and out, and the riser pipe re-covered. 190 </seg>
            <seg id="p196">The fire esca]&gt;e lias been painted; a concrete floor laid m the power house; maniole enlarged and rebuilt and a three stall garage erected. A well has been drilled, and a fifty gallon per minute Pamona pump installed, to replace the old electric pump. The old well had t&lt; be discarded. A pump for ceding boilers has been ordered and will be in - stilled as soon as it arrives from the factor)'. Some interior decorating m the main buildings and the men's imarters, has been done.

            <seg id="p208">'I o the Governor uid the Hoard of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. This report (overs the complete period from July 1, 1-933 to June 30, 1935. The total enrollment m our school during the past year has been 71, with an average attendance of 62. This represents an increase &lt; I* more than twenty per cent for the average Year within the last t v.o decades. Th s increase has laid a heavy burden on our teachers arid has cost the State more for maintenance. The burden on the t .'acher has been so great that m order to do effective work we should return to i he number carried before the very adverse finan - cial conditions of :he state compelled us to reduce our teaching force. &lt; )ur work has suffered, I feel sure, during the past year through the i ecessary decrease m the number of teachers employed. During this liennium we have had only one graduate, — Bruce ' Yyon graduated June, 1934. I anticipate that we shall have two or three graduates ii June, 1936. During the past year we were compelled to open our hospital lor three different short periods, the following epidemics running through the schrol: chicken pox, septic sore throat and measles. We are glad to r;port that they were taken care of m each instance by the employmt nt of a special nurse, and no pupil suffered any serious damage irom the slight infection. The Ministerial Association of Nebraska City has continued to send its member; for special convocation, each being chaplain for wo convocations during the school year. We are highly apprecia - ivc of this service. Unfortunately the trees planted at the celebration of Arbor Day, 1934, all died later m the year. We also lost other beautiful trees m the grounds, so that on Arbor Day, 1935, we planted 33 trees to make up) for the loss. They seem to be doing nicely. 203 </seg>
            <seg id="p209">204 For a number of years Levi L. Coryell, Sr., and his son, Levi L. Coryell, Jr., have assisted us greatly by many contributions and in other ways. This year the School presented to Mr. Coryell, Sr., a former pupil of the School, a fine picture of our main building, with the request that it be hung in the community house at Coryell Park, south of Brock, Nebraska. We had expected to receive Helen Siefert at this school next September. Plans have been made, however, for her return to Perkins Institution. This little deaf-blind girl has made wonderful progress in the nine months of training at the Watertown Institu - tion. Last year our garden was a complete failure. The expenditure of possibly $200 in planting and care of our garden was an absolute loss. This year returns from the cherry orchard, the grape vine - yard and the vegetable garden are much the best for many years. We logic forward to a considerable reduction in the amount of can - ned goods which will be needed to be purchased on contract. I appreciate highly the personal interest and cooperation of each of the members of the Board, and of the Staff at the general offices, in our efforts. Respectfully submitted, N. C. ABBOTT, .

            <seg id="p218">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I beg to submit herewith the Thirty-third Biennial Report of llu Nebraska School for the Deaf, covering the period of the sd obi's activities- fi dm July 1, 1933 to June 30, 1935. The school was started m 1869, m Omaha, and had an attend - ance of 12 pupils m its first year. The attendance during the past biennium reached tjlie total of 258, of which number 204 were m sel 00l on the closing day m June. The approximate ratio of the deaf to the hearing m the state, country, and world population is, on&lt;: deaf m every i wo thousand persons, and the ratio necessarily prevails among children of school age. Our school coi.rse carries pupils, entering at the age of five or six years, through fifteen grades, beginning m the preparatory de - partment, where they spend three years, then passing into the re - gular grades, twelve m number, and graduating m the twelfth grade. Industrial train ng is given to intermediate and advanced pupils: to boys, m printing manual training — carpenter work, painting and gardening; and to g iris, m domestic arts — all kind of sewing, and m donestic science — til kinds of cooking, also m general housework. In the history of the school, covering a period of 66 years, 1,355 pupils have received of its benefits. Of this number 270 have gra - duated, 191 are still on the school roll, and 894 left school after taking limited courses. Of the twenty classes m school during the past year, seventeen classes were taught by using the oral method ,the remaining three by using the manual, c r silent method, that is, using and depending on the hand alphabet md writing. All pupils on entering are placed under oral instruct on, and they continue thus unless at any stage certain pupils show that speech cannot be acquired by them, when they are transferre 1 to a manual : class. 213 </seg>
            <seg id="p219">During the past two years extensive improvements to buildings and grounds have been made by workers furnished by the FERA. This organization furnishes workers, wh^le the State furnishes all materials needed and used. Our school building, erected m 1929, is still lacking a wing, or unit, to complete it. The original architect's plan includes this unit, and the completed building would provide ten additional school rooms and. an assembly room, all much needed for carrying on the school work successfully. At present, seven of our twenty classes occupy rooms m other buildings, rooms not intended for use as school rooms, therefore not adapted to securing the best results. It is hoped that the next session of the Legislature will provide for completing the school building, making it possible to bring all school classes then into one building, securing advantages not now avail - able. In conclusion I wish to thank the Board of Control for the in - terest it has taken m the work of the school and m the care ami up - building of the plant. Also I want to express appreciation of the faithful service of the teachers, officers and helpers who have con - tributed so much toward the success of the work. Respectfully submitted, F. W. BOOTH, Superintendent. 214 </seg>

            <seg id="p230">To the Governor and the Board o£ Control of State Institutions, | Lincoln, Nebraska. 1 have the honor to submit the following Biennial Report of the State Reformatory for Women, covering the period ending June 30, 1935. The majority of girls admitted here have some form of veneral disease. We have been fortunate enough not to have any conta - gious diseases, and enly one death. Twelve major operations have been performed by Drs. Bell and Bell, all with favorable results. Our babies have all been healthy, j ' It is remarkable how soon a girl begins to gain after she comes hen. In three months time they: are looking much better, and by tlie time they are ready to go home, they cannot wear the clothes the} wore when they came in-here. The new girls are usually de - tailed to outside work, which gives them a better opportunity to get well. The detail changes every six weeks so as to give each girl a chance to learn how to do all kinds of general work. We have had id runaways during the past two years. The girls all go to school, and their improvement is shown m their letter writing.. We also have an art class which the girls en - joy- I The sewing-room matron trains the girls m plain sewing, and m fancy work. Some of their work was on display at the State Fair. We have a loom where the rugs are made for the girls' rooms. The ministers (if York conduct our religious services every Sunday, and Miss Edith Lancaster has charge of the Sunday School. ! The girls enjoy :he radio programs, and prepare plays and give entertainments for their own amusement. The Drum and Bugle Corps of York came out and gave us an exhibition of their marching and music. We have pie Hy of reading material. The State Library Commission sends us new magazines, and the ladies of York give us many books for pur library. 225 </seg>
            <seg id="p231">We are endeavoring — will God's help — to make good citizens 'of the girls entrusted to our care. Wq feel that they are all better for being here. The year 1934 was hard on our crops, garden, lawn and flowers. The lack of rain dried everything up. We had to buy ensilage to fill our silo. The alfalfa did fairly well. Due to the lack of moisture our lawn was very poor. This Sring it was all ploughed up and reseeded, so now it is very nice. The young trees were tended well and almost all of them were saved. The year 1935 has been good to us. Our corn and alfalfa crops have grown fine. Fifty acres of alfalfa were planted, and we have a good stand. Corn from eleven acres was planted and put into the silo. We raised enough potatoes for our own use this year. Strawberry and asparagus beds have been planted. A couple of sheds were torn down and a tine granary and feeder for the hogs built from the lumber. A good deal of fencing has been done so as to turn the cattle on the different fields. The cattle and hogs have paid us well, and we have butchered some for our meat. Natural gas mains run through our pasture, and it has been piped into our buildings and we have all enjoyed it. With FERA labor, a new roof was put on West I [all. and the roof of East Hall was tarred. In conclusion, permit me to express my sincere appreciation of the unfailing kindness and helpfulness I; have received at the hands of the Governor and the Hoard of Control. Respectfully submitted, ALMA J. CHAPMAN; Superintendent. 226 </seg>

            <seg id="p242">To the Governor jind the Board oil Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I present herewith the Biennial Report of the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children for the period ending June 30, 1935. Our institutioi is commonly called "The Home." We endeavor to make it truly 'home" to the neglected, dependent and homeless c lildren who come to us. Children are committed to the state by the juvenile judges or tmey may be relinquished by the parents. When they come to us, tlj m need of any medical attention or dental attention, it is given. Confidence m thenselves is developed. Good ideas are presented and high ideals are instilled. This is maintained by keeping a high standard for our caretakers. When the children have readjusted themselves and have re - gained the healthy, normal spirit of childhood, the idea of a foster home is gradually introduced to them. Foster homes are carefully checked by the field workers, then the child and the home are fitted together as much as it is humanly possible to foretell. . By the foregoing methods, 193 children have come into the I- ome and 243 have been placed m foster homes during the last b ennium. Many children who come to us are problem or physically handi - capped cases. WJ: have used boarding homes for these m several ii Stances, as provided by law, with very gratifying results. In the "Home" the older boys are placed upon our farm where they get training m poultry and stock raising, dairying, gardening, horticulture and general farming. The girls are taught cooking, canning, gardening, sewing and housekeeping. Adoptive homes are easily found for younger children. Older c lildren are placed m "free" homes. All children are supervised by oiir field workers until they are adopted or become of age. This is u\vital part of the work of our institution that is not apparent to the lay person and is, therefore, generally overlooked m viewing our program of work. In our placement of children we have worked under the handi - cap of a situation caused by the depression. In many localities of the state people have felt they could not afford to accept a child into 237 </seg>
            <seg id="p243">their homes without bringing hardships to all. The drought last year handicapped our placements even more. An even greater problem arose because of the fact that greater areas of our state were so crippled by depression conditions that our children m free homes m these districts were threatened with a return to the institu - tion. If they had returned we would have had no money to pay the tuition to the schools, no room and no food. To help meet this situation, a greater amount of clothing was given on these cases than had ever been before. This, again, was a drain upon our already limited finances, but the homes for these children were saved to them. The forty-ninth session of the Legislature gave us an ap - propriation for a new building. This is a fine structure. We have occupied a portion of it since last February but had no furniture for the major part of the building. Considering the limited ap - propriation and the change of program to meet drought heeds, we feel we dare not use maintenance niont}' for upkeep and repair of our buildings. As a result, they greatly show the neglect. We depend to a great extent upon the products from our farm and gardens for food. As we had no returns from these m 1934. as others did, we had to purchase feed for our stock at a sacrifice of other things. Despite interrupted plans, we feel that many things have been accomplished of which we may be proud. We have an increasing dairy herd which is supplying about one-third of the milk for the institution. We have a flock of chickens which have proven most profitable. Our children have been most cooperative and re - sponsive under the stress. We believe it has helped develop real stability of character. The health of the family has been good. The usual children's diseases have been confined to individunls easily controlled by isolation for which we arc now prepared. Our .school folk have made splendid records One of our senior boys made the National Honorary Society m 1935. Twenty - five girls entered nurses' training. Several have earned their board, room and tuition m higher schools. The morale of our family apparently is better than it has been for several years. I wish to express my appreciation to my corps of employees for their splendid service and for their assistance m making this a real "home." To the members of the Hoard of Control 1 wish to express my gratitude for their kindly understanding and consideration shown us. Respectfully submitted, 1 EFFIEJ. MOUDEN, Superintendent. 238 </seg>

            <seg id="p256">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the Honor to present my Seventh Biennial Report of the State Reformatory for Men for the bienniutn ending June 30, 1935. We began the biennium with a population of 386 and closed with a count of 299. The decrease shown m our population is par - tially accounted I for by the establishement of the Federal Civilian Conservation Cojrps throughout the State. The general! health of the institution continues to be good. All inmates entering this institution are examined by our re - gular physician, md m order to bring about a betterment m the con - dition of the individual, I recommend that means be provided where - by each inmate could receive a more thorough physicial examination as applies to the eyes, ears, nose, throat and teeth, and treatments be administered which would bring about a correction of the ailment. The morale of the institution continues good. The License Plate and Highway Marker Factory is doing splen - did work ; our orders are increasing and the shop is active almost throughout the entire year, under the supervision of Mr. John. F. Gettman. The drouth jand the hot winds of last year ruined our crops, md the wet early season this year hampered the growing of our plants to the extent that we are of the opinion that little can be ex - pected of our Cannery this biennium. The Shirt Factory manufactures many of our garments, and re - &gt;airs all worn clothing. The Shoe Repair department keeps the shoes of the inmates re - paired, and it is hoped that we can add up-to-date equipment m this lepartment and repair the shoes of inmates of other institutions. Our dairy herd is increasing, and it is planned to furnish the nilk for other institutions before another year has expired. 251 </seg>
            <seg id="p257">We have not increased the acreage of our farming industry; al - though hot winds and drouth curtailed a showing last year, we ex - pect a better showing of crops grown on this land this season. Regular grade school work for beginners and those whose schooling has been neglected, is progressing nicely and showing good results. Our Library is enjoyed by a great many of inmates who are urged to become interested m this literature. Sports such as handball, baseball, football, basketball and horse - shoe are participated m by a great many of our inmates who love the outdoor games. The regular Chapel service is held every Sunday afternoon and is attended and enjoyed by the inmates. Other religious ser - vices are also held throughout the day. Father J. L. O'Donnell has been added to our staff as Catholic Chaplain. Reverend H. Erck continues to hold his Hawthorne Bible Class each Monday night throughout the school year. I desire to express my appreciation for the loyalty and devotion displayed by all the officers and employees of our institution. Their problems have been many and their hours of labor long, but a gen - eral desire to cooperate has been manifested most enthusiastically. Especially I desire to recognize and give expression of my ap - preciation to the loyalty and cooperation given me by my assistant, Mr. H. W. Jespersen, and chief clerk, Marie Gettman. In closing I desire to thank your Excellency for your continued assistance and cooperation; also the members of the Board of Con - trol for their suport and aid given me and this institution m meeting the problems constantly coming before us m institutional work. Respectfully submitted, A. W. MILLER, Superintendent. 252 </seg>

            <seg id="p272">Report of Dairy Herds at State Institutions </seg>
            <seg id="p273">To the Governor and the Board of Control of Stale Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. There are dairy herds at 13 of the 17 state institutions. The four institutions not having dairy herds are either located in met - ropolitan districts or are of such a nature as would make a dairy herd impractical. These 13 herds arc made up of a total of 1100 Hblstein-Frtcsian cattle, about a third of which are registered. During the past two years there was an average of 410 cows in milk daily, furnishing milk and other dairy products for 8100 people. These herds vary in size according to the population of the institution. For example, there are only 10 producing cows in the herd at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home at Milford while there are 80 at the Hastings State Hospital. Besides furnishing the milk and cream and much of the butter and cheese for the institutions these herds furnish occupation for the inmates. By maintaining a high class of stock the inmates lake a great deal of pride and interest in the animals assigned to their care. All of the cattle are tested periodically for Tuberculosis and Bangs' Disease (contagious abortion) and are practically 100% free of these diseases. Much has been done in the past few months to eliminate mastitis from the herds and this malady has been reduced to a low percentage of infection. By this careful attention to the health of the cattle a pure and wholesome supply of milk is assured for the institution kitchens. The dairy herds exhibited their merit quite conclusively through the drouth of 1934. While feed was a serious problem and feed costs were high and milk prices low the herds came through again with an increase in production over the year before and showed a net profit of $20,000.00 over feed costs. I wish to acknowledge and express our appreciation to the State Veterinary department for the services they have given us in the health work in our herds and to the University of Nebraska for their splendid cooperation in helping work out our breeding program and organization and the solutions' of an infinite number of pro - blems.
