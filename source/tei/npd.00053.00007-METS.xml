            <seg id="p002">The author- wi-h la acknowledge the assistance of the corps of worker- who conducted the te-t&gt; and prepared the results lor publication. The efforts of L. W. Chase in effecting the organization of the University's part of the work outlined in the tractor testing law (H. R. 85 — Thirty-seventh Session) : the assistance of Prof. J. W. Haney of the Mechanical Engineering Department in designing the dynamometer car and as a wmmkm of the Tractor Test Board; and the work of C. K. Shedd. the fir&gt;t manager of tests, in planning, organizing and carrying out the program, were especially commendable. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">THE NEBRASKA TRACTOR TESTS Board of Tractor Test Engineers O. W. Sjogren, E. E. Brackett, C. W. Smith. Acting Manager of Tractor Tests: F. R. Nohavec. Tin' results of the tractor tests as reported in this bulletin mm those obtained in carrying out the provisions of the Nebraska Tractor I jaw. known as House Roll No. 85, of the Thirtv-seventh Session, which became effective Julv 15. 1919. Briefly . the provisions of the law are: ( 1 ) That a stock tractor of each model sold in the state -liall U' tested and passed upon by the board of three engineers iimler State University management. (2) That each company, dealer, or individual who offers m tractor for sale in Nebraska shall have a permit issued by the State Railway Commission. The permit for any model of tractor will be issued after a stock tractor of that model has baa tested at the University and the performance of the tractor compared with the claims made for it by the manu - facturer. . I :&gt; ) That a service station with full supply of replace - ment parts for each model of tractor shall be maintained within the confines of the State and within reasonable shipping distance of customers. (4) That the State Railway Commission shall have full authority to enforce the law. THE OBJECT OF THE LAW It can thus l&gt;e seen that the real object of the law is to prevent the sale of over-rated tractors in the State of Nebraska, and to provide a reasonable assurance of prompt repair service to tractor users. The law specifies that this work shall be carried on under the direction of three engineers in the employ of the University. These three engineers were chosen from the De - partment of Agricultural Engineering, which department carries on the tractor work of the institution. It was thought desirable that these engineers should act in an advisory capacity and that a Manager of Tractor Tests should be employed to take active charge of the work under the direction of the </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Xkuraska Experiment Station BcLLRIX 177 4 Board. With this object in view, the position of Manager of Tractor Tests was created, it being his duty to assume active charge of conducting the tests and attending to the details of the work. A large number of meetings of the Board were held for the consideration of the series of tests to be made, the rules to be followed, etc. The following is a brief outline of the steps followed in carrying out the complete official test under the law as adopted bv the Board of Tractor Test Engineers : (a) Drawbar work at from one-third load to f till load for twelve hours. Reasonable additional time is allowed if it is found desirable. This lest gives opportunity for the tractor to limber up. (b) Brake horsepower at rated load and rated &gt;peed for two hours. This test shows whether the tractor will carry it-. rated load on the Iw-lt : it also shows fuel consumption at rated load. (c) Brake horsepower at load varying from maximum to no load with all engine adjustments as in (b). for one hour. This test shows fuel consumption and speed control on varying load. (d) Brake horsepower at maximum load for our hour with governor s,.t to give full Ofwif of- the governor valve and carburetor adjusted to give maximum power at rated speed. This te&gt;t mows fuel consumption and hoCMfMWW of the tractor on the lx'lt on maximum load. (e) Brake horsepower at one-half load for one hour with governor set M in test (b) and carburetor adjusted for nio-t economical operation at one-half load. This te-t shows fuel consumption at one-half load. (f) Drawbar horsepower at rated load for ten hour^. This test is made on a half-mile cinder track and shows whether the tractor will carry its rated drawbar load contin - uously: it also shows fuel consumption on drawbar work. (g) Maximum drawbar horsepower. This test i- a series of short runs with an increase of load for each run until the engine is overloaded or the drive wheels slip excessively. (h) Miscellaneous. This may include investigation of work on inclines, turning radius, effectiveness of brakes, or any other feature of the tractor which may seem to require special observation. (i) Tractors are under observation for endurance thruout the complete test as outlined above. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">The Nebraska Tractor Tests 5 APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT USED Considerable apparatus and equipment had to be built or purchased in order to properly carry out the provisions of the law. For eanynaj out of the lH*lt tot. ■ Bftmgm electric dynamometer of 150 horsepower capacity was installed, as it vm considered to be the mo-t satisfactory for the continual ranting mtetmUJ in testing the machines. For the drawbar work no Mitable machine! and apparatus could be obtained and it m aemuarv tliat a iptfitl machine for this work- lie designed and built by the University, llesides these two dynamometers, there was secured several widths and lengths of U'lts. scales for the weighing of fuel and water, scale stand-. ke for conducting the belt horsepower tests. ■MMWMg can-. s|&gt;eed counters, fuel tanks, rollers, graders, and sprinkler tank. The drawbar work was carried out on an out - door oval track approximately one-half mile long. This track ha- some slight slopes, none of which exceeds three and one - half per cent. In order to keep the condition of the track as uniform as possible, fine cinders were mixed with the top &gt;oil. The condition of the track was kept as nearly uniform as possible by d ragging, rolling and sprinkling. i . — — wn o i During the drawbar test a (Jullev traction dynamometer \\a- attached between the tractor and the dvnamometer car, to </seg>

During the rated drawbar test the load was adjusted to require a pull such that the tractor would have to exert its rated drawbar horsepower in order to mow it at the specified rate of travel. During: the Ix'lt tests, the desired load \v;is readily obtained by adjusting the dynamo - meter. OPERATORS During the liml&gt;ering-up test a company representative was required to operate the tractor in order to insure that it wn working properly, but on all succeeding tests the tractor waa operated by an employee of the University. The tractor com - pany was requested to have a representative pivs.-nt to observe the test, but he was not [millittod to operate the machine or to make any adjustments without the consent of the engineer in charge. REPORTS At the conclusion of each test the results were tabulated and embodied in an official report consisting of a statement of the performance of the tractor in each part of the te&gt;t a&gt; t" belt horsepower develojM'd. engine speed, kind and amount of fuel used, amount of water used, temperature of cooling fluid, drawbar horsepower, drawbar pull in pound--. &gt;p"ed in mile- per hour, slippage of drive wheels and amount and kind of lubri - cating oil used. ADVERTISING LITERATURE All advertising literature submitted with the application was gone through and any claims that seemed unreasonable or excessive on points not comparable with the results of the test, were quoted on the official report. It was not thought necessary to include this part of the report in this bulletin as steps have l&gt;een taken by the firms to correct &gt;uch statements in the new literature. If these comments are desired, copies of the official report may 1&gt;&gt; obtained from the Agricultural Engineering Department at 15 cents per report. REPAIRS AND ADJUSTMENTS In the comments on each tractor is mentioned the repairs and adjustments made during the test. Fides-, otherwise noted, each tractor was apparently in good condition at the end of the test and there was no evidence of undue wear or of any weakness that might require early repairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">The Nebraska Tractor Tests • SUMMARY OF REPORTS A MBMHUTT of the data contained in the reports is given !i the table, Changes made after the reports were issued are Iii this table the lasta are grouped in five divisions, three of these falling under the belt test and two under the drawbar ir-t. In all the tests an effort was made to keep the engine -peed m near the rated figure as possible, excepting in the ramble load test where the engine speed was allowed to vary within the limits of the governor without any adjustments being OMda during this part of the test. Under this variable -j»eed test is shown the highest and the lowest engine speed, which &lt;nves a direct indication of the governor control of the engine. The fuel readings for each part of the test are given in gallon- per hour and horsepo\fWT?er gallon, the highest figures in the latter column indicating *he better fuel economy. The water consumption is given in gallons per hour. The temper - iiiuiv is given for l&gt;oth the air and cooling fluid in order to -how if the engine tends to run hot. In the maximum drawbar test the drawbar pull and speed in miles per hour only are given. It should be kept in mind that this test was taken over short runs and that the tractor could probably not maintain this pull except for very short periods. Thruotit the entire test an accurate record was kept of all repairs and adjustments necessary on the tractor and the ■MM has been incorporated in the official reports. Applications for test were received for 103 tractors; of this nuinlier thirty-five withdrew without appearing for test. Of the sixty-eight which appeared for test, six increased their rated engine speed, four decreased their horsepower rating, seven failed to make their rating, eleven changed some item of equipment (two of these also changed ratings,) and three withdrew after starting the preliminary test. One of these later made a new application, reappeared and completed the Test Xo. 1. Waterixw Boy. Model "M" 12-25. Dixie magneto, Schebler "D" carburetor. Adjusted valve tappet rods. Test Xo. 3.

            <seg id="p009">The Nebraska Tractor Tests 9 after the brake test had been completed the engine was started in the usual way, gaining speed rapidly, and after only a few revolutions the clutch and belt wheel broke into many pieces and were thrown in various directions. The cause for the breakage could not be determined. The wrecking of this clutch and belt wheel would indicate a serious defect in this traitor if it were certain the accident was due to weakness in these parts. It is probable, however, that the breaking of these parts was due to some other cause and not the fault of the tractor. The report holds that the tractor should not be disqualified because of this accident. Test No. 10. Heider 12-20. Dixie "46"' magneto, Kings - ton "1^5" carburetor.
