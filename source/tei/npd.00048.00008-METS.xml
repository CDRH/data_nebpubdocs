            <seg id="p003">OFFICE OF STATE LIBRARIAN Lincoln, December 20, 1920. To the Honorable Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor of Nebraska. Pursuant to law I herewith submit my report as librarian of the Nebraska state library for the biennium ending Decem - ber 1, 1920. The report shows that on December 1, 1918, there were 75,951 regularly accessioned volumes in the library and that since that time 1,666 volumes have been added by purchase, 540 by donation and 890 by exchange, making a total of 3,096 volumes added during the biennium, and a total of 79,047 volumes now in the libraiy. Unbound volumes, pamphlets and the sale stock of Nebraska supreme court reports are not included in these totals. Under the law ihe decisions of the supreme court are printed under the direction of its reporter and 1,000 copies of each volume of decisions ai c- placed in the hand of the librarian for d.stiibution and sale. Volumes 102 and 103 have been published during the biennium. Of these reports, 221 copies oi' each have been distributed free and on exchange to the judges oi' the supreme BMllt, d strict and county courts, state officers, state libraries, etc., and G05 copies sold at $2 per volume. During the same period 696 copies of the preceding volumes oi supreme court reports have been sold at the same p ice, making a total of 1,301 copies sold for $2,602. The 1 brarian has also sold 815 copies of the 19i9 session laws and 458 copies of session laws of previous years for the sum of $1,609.50. The proceeds ox all sales amounting to $4,211.50 have been paid to the state treasurer and credited by him to the library fund for the purchase of 'books. In this connection it may be well to call attention to the fact that the edition of 1915 session laws has been exhausted. As our last revision of the laws was made in 1913 and it is now impossible for the stale to furnish a copy of all the laws now in force to persons desiring them, it is imperative that steps be taken at once to remedy this condition of affairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 REPORT OF THE The many requests made to the library for information as to the proceedings of our state legislature demonstrate that the present method of distributing legislative journals and session laws is at fault. I The legislature should give the people more ready access its proceedings and I recommend that provision be made for e sending of a copy of the session laws and legislative jour- Is by the secretary of state or other proper custodian directly each tax -supported library in the state. There are now 116 ih libraries in Nebraska and very few of them obtain such oks, although section 3737, Rev. St. 1913, provides that the inty clerk may, "after supplying county officers, members of i legislature and justices of the peace, distribute copies to raries". As I understand it, the capitol commission contemplates pi-oviding accommodations for the supreme court and library in the new capitol. If this is to be done it is most important that the main reading room of the library be on the same floor with the court rooms, the judges' private offices and the senate and house chambers. Anyone at all familiar with the every - day demands of those departments of the state's government, will see the necessity for this arrangement. The state's great library ought be made accessible and immediately serviceable to those who need it. Owing to the unforeseen increase in the price of books and all other commodities connected with our usual activities it has been impossible for the library to keep its expenditures with'n the appropriations made two years ago and there will necessarily be a considerable deficiency to be reported to the leg sla ure. The library interests of Nebraska have been unfortunate in having lost the services of Miss Mary K. Ray of the state library and of the Misses Charlotte Templeton and Helen Matthewson of the library commission, all of whom have been most efficient in their lines for many years. Other states have sec red the benefit of their experience by the payment of higher salaries. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">STATE LIBRARIAN, 1919-1920 5 Attached to this report is a statement of the condition of the library and supreme court funds, a detailed statement of the receipt and disposition of supreme court repoi"ts, and an appendix showing the additions to the state library, alphabeti - cally arranged. Very respectfully, H. C. LINDSAY, Librarian. </seg>
