            <seg id="p004">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT Lincoln, Nebraska, July 1, 1936 To His Excellency, Roy L. Cochran, Governor: Sir: In compliance with the constitutional requirement I have the honor to submit the following report of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, who is also the Secretary of the Board of Educa - tional Lands and Funds, for the biennium beginning i uly 1, 1934, and ending July 1, 1936. Yours respectfully, LEO N. SWANSON, Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT MINERAL LEASES On January 13, 1936, it was duly moved, seconded, and carried that the following resolution be adopted in regard to Mineral Leases: "Whereas, the present fee for Mineral Lease is so high that it dis - courages prospecting for oil in this State, Whereas, it appears that there is a movement on foot to attempt to discover oil within this State, and that many applications have been made for the right to prospect on School Lands, * That the rule adopted by thie Board of Educational Lands and Funds on June 10. 1924, found in Book D, page 196, be amended to read as follows: "The fees for issuing of mineral leases for prospecting for oil on schcol lands shall not be less than ten cents per acre.' " During this biennium thirty-nine mineral leases have been issued covering 22,424 20/100 acres of school lands, making a total fee of S2.242.40. SALE OF ISOLATED TRACTS Isolated tracts are tracts of forty acres or less not bound by any olher school lands and can be sold, according to the laws set forth. During this biennium the following isolated tracts of land were sold: County De icriptlon Price Dodge 7.84 acres .'. $776.00 Washington., j 37.70 acres 271.44 Total I 45.54 acres $1046.44 SALE CONTRACTS EXTENDED A Sale Contract that has expired can be extended only by action of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. It is the duty of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings at the expiration of the 'contract .to notify and direct the County Clerk of the respective counties where the land is located to enter such lands upon the tax list of the County. In this biennium there have been granted 200 extensions of time on Sale Contracts, all of them for five years with the exception of one which was granted for ten years. The County Clerk has been notified to place the land on the tax rolls since June 1935. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT REAPPRAISEMENT OF SCHOOL LANDS School Lands are reappraised by a standard of classification. Where classifications are made, the State Surveyor views each forty acre tract of School Land fcr the purpose of obtaining all the necessary informa - tion relative to the type and rating of the soil, its adaptability, and the topographical characteristics of the land. A map is drawn show - ing the actual condition of each forty acre tract. Normally school land-: are divided into four types, namely: cultivated, hay. grazing, and wa^te lands. Iiach type of land is divided into more than one differ - ent grade accoiding to its degree of productiveness. In arriving at the productive value of the cultivated land, the soil type and region in which it is located are the two most important factors. Hay and grazing land - are usually divided into three classes each. This classification map referred to contains, in addition to the above data, all information relative u&gt; movable and immovable im - provements, together with the value of same. Under the law the State has a prior lien on all movable improvements on State School Lands in the event of unpaid rental or interest on contracts. After the land in a particular county has been mapped and classi - fied, a public hearing is held at the county seat town. The C&lt; unty Commissioners sit in jointly with the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings not to determine the individual lease value but to ar - rive at a fair value per acre of the various types of land in the county. </seg>

Filters, pumps, and traps were cleaned and repaired. Plumbing fixtures, faucets and closet valves required extensive renairs. This, with the operation of mach.nery and constant care watching for leakage in steam and water, commands a full-.im, expert mechanic. The savings in steam, due to careful opera - ton nAd cut in rate from fifty-two cents to forty cents per thou and p.und^ of steam, more than saves the State Mr. Leo N. Swanson s salary.; Re -peel fully submitted, ■ JAMES H. PINE. Operating Engineer. | . • ■■;•'•■":■ ELECTRICIAN Over seventy-five motors and the complete lighting system need constant attention to keep down operating costs and service losses Mr mrst daily, additional light service is requested. Constant watch on the Tart of Mr. Swanson and his efforts in decreasing the power rate from two cents per kilcwat to one and one-half cents during the summer and one and one-third cents per kilowat during the winter have more than offset the additional current consumption and showed a saving equal to the amount of his salary. Elevators, likewise, need constant repair and watching. This has been done without outside help. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT Every effort has been made to give as much service as possible and yet keep within the budget. Respectfully submitted, H. P. MITCHELL, Electrician. ASSISTANT CUSTODIAN Keeping the cost of operation of mechanical equipment at a mini - mum requires constant supervision and vigilance in order that such equipment be kept in perfect working order at all times and the strain and wear be kept at a minimum so that maximum efficiency may be ob - tained at all times. Constant care and close inspection are required to ascertain whether machinery should be repaired or replaced at the proper time. All supplies have been placed under lock and key, and none other than the one in authority has access to these supplies. Owing to the recent cut of approximately §30,000 in our appro - priation, we were compelled to avail ourselves of outside help. Through the efforts of Mr. Swanson a W. P. A. labor project was secured, and this labor was used to repair the terraces and to stop leaks which were causing a great deal of damage. Without this outside assistance, this could, not have been done, owing to lack of funds. Likewise, due to the shortage of funds, it became necessary for the Capitol Commission to pay $1,651.97 for water used in their department which wa- formerly paid fiom our appropriation.

The maps of the first five counties in the years 1933 and 1934 were temporary pencil sketches. I suggest that recommendations be made to the next regular session of the legislature for an ; appropriation of rufficient funds for the employment of one full time deputy state surveyor and for expenses and material, that the surveying and land classification wcrk of this department may be fa - cilitated. This additional help is especially needed with reference to the preparation of a permanent record of land classification. I suggest that the permanent classification' maps be drawn on tracing cloth so that corrections and additional data might be added to the original map and that inexpensive copies may be furnished to the county treasurers and interested parties. The addition of a full time deputy surveyor to this department would enable the depa:tment to classify, prepare the final record and compute the areas and valuations of school land in about three months time from the date of authorization by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, making the changes in rental effective as of the next rent paying date. Whereas, at present this department is nearly a year behind in all work connected with school land classi - fication. H. B. LAWSON. State Surveyor. </seg>
