            <seg id="p068">THIUTY-FIKST ANNUAL KEPOKT In the Matter of the Application of ) I , All Nebraska Railroads for authority ) APPLICATION NO. 12707 to increase Nebraska intrastate ) freight rates and charges. ) OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: On November 5, 1937, all railroads of the United States filed a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission seeking approval of a fifteen per cent increase m substantially all interstate freight rates and charges. This petition was docketed by the Interstate Commerce Commission as Ex Parte 123. The concluding paragraph of the petition referred to is reproduced below: "Petitioners state that the increased operating costs hereinbefore referred to are being and will bo incurred by them m the handling of intrastate, as well as interstate, traffic and that the estimate of increased revenues which petitioners will receive, as set forth m Paragraph VI hereof, reflects the application of the proposed increases m rates, fares and charges to intrastate traffic. It is respectfully suggested, therefore, that the cooperation of the State com - missions be invited, as provided by law, m any investigation instituted and conducted by the Commission as herein prayed for." On November 15, 1937 all Nebraska Railroads filed this appli - cation alleging that increased expenditures for increased wages, prices of materials and supplies and taxes have seriously impaired, and threaten to further impair; their financial resources and their capacity to furnish and maintain an adequate railway transportation service. It is further alleged that such increased costs for taxes, wages and materials are applicable alike to intrastate and interstate commerce and that, the failure to allow the same increase on intra - state traffic as may be permitted by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission as to interstate traffic would result m undue and unreason - able discrimination against intrastate commerce and undue prejudice against shippers and localities m interstate commerce. We are asked to : "authorize the carriers by steam railroad m the state of Nebraska, by publication m the manner hereinbefore described, to make increases m all freight rates and charges m Nebraska corresponding to those which shall be authorized or permitted by the Interstate Commerce Commission m the aforesaid proceeding with respect to interstate freight rates and charges" ***. 68 </seg>
            <seg id="p069">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The Interstate Commerce Commission instituted Ex Parte 123 as a cooperative proceeding for joint consideration of the proposed rate increases by state and federal authorities. The Nebraska State Railway Commission did not directly participate in the cooperative hearings but a copy of the transcript of testimony including exhibits in the Ex Parte 123 hearing was filed with us. The cooperative proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission was submitted on February 9, 193S, after hearings in all sections of the United States, and was decided March 8, 1938; Fifteen Per Cent Case 1937-1938, 226 I.C.C. 41. A hearing on this application was had on April 4th and 5th, 1938. The record before the Interstate Commerce Commission was made part of our record in this proceeding and supplementary evidence was presented by Nebraska llailroads and shippers of sand, gravel, rip-rap and brick and related articles. The evidence establishes the need for increased revenues by Xcbraska railroads. The testimony as to conditions in recent months shows a continuance of the unfavorable trend of carloadings, gross and net revenues. The proposed increases are ten per cent of all rates and charges, except agricultural commodities five per cent, and excepting various commodities and items of traffic which were sub - jected to increases in General Commodity Kate Increases 1937, 223 I.C.C. 657. The decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission defines the permitted increases as follows: "All existing rates and charges, including those for accessorial services other than protective service against heat or cold, upon the date of this decision, including those found or prescribed by us as reasonable and not yet effective, may be increased, and as increased may be maintained (sub - ject to application of the rule of fractions suggested upon the hearing), by 10 percent, except the rates on products of agriculture other than tropical fruits; except the rates on animals and products and the products thereof and articles taking the same rates, horses and mules not being included in this exception; and except lumber, shingles, and lath, and articles taking lumber rates; and except the rates on cotton - seed oil and vegetable oils, n.o.s., other than linseed oil, as to all of which excepted groups of commodities the increase in rates may be 5 percent; and except anthracite, which may be increased 10 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds; and except bituminous coal, lignite, coke and iron ore, which commodities justly and reasonably should bear no further increases than those already imposed pursuant to authority granted in the case last cited; all import rates may be increased 10 percent, 69 </seg>
            <seg id="p070">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT . but not to exceed the contemporaneous domestic rates in - creased as herein provided. But m making such increases, all effective increases accomplished under the authority to the decision last cited, or m the transcontinental rates which were increased m connection therewith as before recited, and m the cotton rates and m those on other commodities effec - tive early m 1937, as above described, shall be taken into account and considered as part of the increases here author - ized, so that the above-mentioned percentage increases shall not be made cumulative thereon. The increases authorized may not reasonably exceed the specific maxima originally proposed by the applicants to be applied upon lumber, sugar, fruits, and vegetables. Such rates and charges, as those upon fresh milk and cream, and those for protective service, which applicants m their petition or on the hearing disclaimed intention to increase, are not included within this authori - zation and increases on them arc not found to have been justified. As increased as above specified, to the extent indicated, but only to that extent, the resulting general basis of rates and charges of the carriers described will be just and reasonable. ♦♦♦* "When tariffs provide that switching charges of other carriers will be absorbed subject to stated maximum absorp - tions, such maximum absorptions should be increased m the same percentage as the charges. Similarly, where switching charges of connecting carriers are absorbed subject to pro - visions that the resultant line-haul revenue shall not be less than a stated minimum, such minimum should be increased 10 per cent." The Interstate Commerce Commission stated its reasons for re - fusing to grant the full 15 per cent incroase as follows: "An increase of 15 per cent, generally based upon a normal volume of traffic, as proposed, is for a larger amount than is reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of the increase, if realizable, and will be such a deterrent to traffic as to stifle movement. The addition to present rates of a lesser percentage of increase than that proposed coupled with the increasing of many rates which are now below levels we have already approved as reasonable, ■will result m a more harmonious rate structure, and will compensate for the added costs shown, based on a normal flow of traffic, and will better insure such a flow of traffic than a' blanket horizontal-percentage increase. The present attempt to allo - cate the necessary increased revenue m flat amounts to be 70 </seg>
            <seg id="p071">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION added to existing rates would be hazardous m its possible revenue results, and would unduly ignore the element of distance as a measure of cost." The interstate rate increases authorized by the Interstate Com - merce Commission have been m effect since March 28, 1938. The applicant carriers produced testimony of their own traffic officials and certain Nebraska shippers and manufacturers to the effect that the imposition of the same increases on Nebraska state traffic as were authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission 08 to interstate traffic would not prevent the free movement of such traffic. This evidence is quite general m nature although there is specific testimony by Omaha iron and steel fabricators and dealers m salvage morals supporting the proposed increases. The testimony of supporting shippers can not be accorded much weight m view of the fact that the rates on basic commodities, such as iron and steel, m which these shippers are interested were' subjected to rate in - creases m General Commodity Rate Increases 1937, supra and our Application No. 12730, effective January 1, 1938, and no further increases m rates on these commodities are proposed here. The proposed increases are opposed by shippers of sand, gravel, rip-rap stone and brick and related articles all of which are heavy loading cheap commodities. Sand and gravel miners produced several witnesses, one of whom spoke for all producers of sand and gravel m the state who are served by rail facilities. For many years these producers of sand and gravel made shipments by railroad exclusively and they prefer to ship by rail. A few of these sand and gravel pits are still usod for exclusive rail shipments but most producers have reluctantly been compelled to provide facilities for loading trucks. Deposits of sand and gravel are widely distributed m all parts of the state and local or roadside pits are the source of a large part of the sand and gravel used m recent years. Truck movement for short hauls from such roadside pits to highway or other construction pro - jects has largely replaced rail shipments of this commodity. Out of 48,000 fifty ton carloads; equivalent tonnage, of sand and gravel used on highway projects m Nebraska during the year 1937, only 6,000 carloads moved by railroad. The remaining tonnage, 42,000 carloads, moved by truck. Sand and gravel producers testified that the proposed increase of ten per cent wonld further reduce rail ship - ments and therefore reduce and not increase railroad revenues. Con - tractors engaged m rip-rapping the Missouri river under contracts with the federal government opposed the increases. Rip-rap stone and crushed stone are commodities to which sand and gravel rates are applicable between points m this state. Shippers of brick and related articles made a similar showing as to the diminishing volume 71 </seg>
            <seg id="p072">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT of railroad shipments due to the competition of trucks some of which are operated by the producers of clay products although common carrier truck operators handle the bulk of the tonnage at very low rates. Shippers of these clay products stated that the rate increases would reduce and not increase revenues. Counsel for applicants emphasized the contention that man - agerial discretion should be given an opportunity to try the proposed increases on sand and gravel, rip-rap and clay products to ascertain the revenue effects m spite of the shipper testimony forecasting further reductions m tonnage and revenues. In denying the full 15 per cent increase the Interstate Commerce Commission said: "An increase of 15 per cent, generally, upon a normal volume of traffic, as proposed, is for a larger amount than is reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of the increase, if realizable, and will be such a deterrent to traffic as to stifle movement." (emphasis ours). The testimony, shows that the proposed increases as applied to sand and gravel and related articles including rip-rap stone and brick and related articles will be such a deterrent to traffic as to stifle - movement and therefore reduce rather than increase railroad re - venues. Such increases are not justified. FINDINGS We therefore find: !■ — That Nebraska railroads require additional revenue and have justified increases m freight rates and charges applicable to Nebraska intrastate traffic on the sr.mp basis as the similar increases granted by the Interstate Commerce Commission for application to interstate traffic, except as to the following commodities which are excepted from the increases for reasons stated above: Excepted Commodities: Sand, Gravel and Stone, Crushed, Chipped, Dust, Rip - rap and Rubble, fof irregular random widths, lengths and thicknesses, not suitable for manufacture, cutting or dress - ing, actual' value at origin point not m excess of $4.50 per ton of 2,000 lbs.)

            <seg id="p080">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the Matter of the Application of ) All Nebraska Railroads for authority ) APPLICATION NO. 12707 t,o increase Nebraska intrastate ) Supplement No. 1 freight rates and charges. ) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Following the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Fifteen Per Cent Case 1937-1938, 226 I.C.C. 41, commonly known as Ex Parte 123 we authorized all Nebraska railroads to increase their freight rates and charges by amounts equivalent to the in - creases granted for interstate application by federal authority. Based on a showing that shipments of brick and related articles and shipments of sand, gravel and stone, as described in the opinion and findings, are highly competitive with truck shipments and that increased rates for rail movement will be such a deterrent to rail traffic as to reduce instead of increase revenues from such shipments; we denied any increase in the rates applicable to such traffic. Insofar as line haul rates are concerned this exemption of brick, sand, gravel and stone from the rate increases has been complied with in publishing amended tariffs. In the case of switching rates the tariffs generally provide a charge per car applicable to all commodi - ties. The rule for absorption of switching provides a minimum charge per car originally $18.50 and, $20.35 as increased, below which the line haul carriers will not apply their switching absorption arrange - ments. Applicants herein ask authority to increase all switching charges for handling brick, sand, gravel and stone and the minimum per car rharge governing absorption of switching by applying the increased charges applicable to all other commodities. Among other things it is pointed out that the exemption of these commodities from in - creased switching charges would involve expensive revision of all SSL^'.'^ ' he reas °n* *&gt;r refusing the increase in connection with line haul charges do not apply to switching services. Stoum 1S 1 tak6n t0 SWitChin&amp; Charges - In the case °* minimum per car charges governing switching absorptions a different question as involved. A ten per cent increase in the minimum charge per car governing switching absorptions would have the effect 5 allowing more than the full increase in line haul charges based on 80 </seg>

For this reason the increased minimum charge per car governing absorption of switching will not be allowed as to the exempted commodities, brick and related articles and sand, gravel and stone. FINDINGS The Commission being fully advised in the premises, we are of the opinion and so find: I That the increased switching and accessorial charges approved by our original order in this application as to commodities generally should be approved for application to shipments of brick and related articles and shipments of sand, gravel and stone. II That the increased minimum per car earnings governing switch - ing absorptions should not be approved for application to shipments of brick and related articles and to shipments of sand, and gravel and stone as described in our original report and order herein.

Rates are established to meet motor truck competition and expire with December 31, 1938, unless sooner changed, can - celled or extended. Applicant bases such request upon the following facts which present certain special circumstances and conditions justifying the request herein made: The Nebraska Railroads, particularly those operating in the terri - tory adjacent to the Platte River, have experienced considerable difficulty in securing what they term to be a fair share of the sand and gravel business moving within the state of Nebraska. Consider - able thought has been given to whether or not a reduced basis of rates would be conducive to a greater movement by rail and thus increase the carriers' revenues. The carriers are in dire need of in - creased revenue at the present time, and since there appears to be a difference of opinion as between the shippers and the carriers as to whether or not a reduced basis of rates would bring about increased revenues, the carriers have concluded to try out, for the balance of this year, the Western Trunk Line Docket 5319-D scale, which has been used quite extensively in providing truck competitive rates on Nebraska intrastate traffic. In many instances where the carriers have been permitted by your Commission to provide emergency temporary rates on the 5319-D scale basis, the carriers have enjoyed some movement, while in con - nection with the normal scale very little movement has taken place. It is hoped, therefore, that your Commission will grant the temporary 83 </seg>
            <seg id="p084">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT authority herein sought in order that we may determine by actual practice whether or not a reduced scale of rates will result in in - creased revenue to the carriers. The season for road surfacing and other seasonal work is now at hand and we urge, therefore, that an emergency exists and that the application be granted on one day's notice. The establishment of this scale for the temporary period will obviate the. necessity of requesting reduced rates based on this scale and give all interested shippers a definite basis upon which to consider rail service.

J. Rohwitz, Chairman, and J. W. Weingarten, Attorney, for Ne - braska Railroads of Western Trunk Line Committee, seeks authority to put m force the rates, rules and regulations now effective for Nebraska intrastate traffic by Motor Vehicle as approved by order of the Nebraska Commission m Resolution No. 146 and Supplements thereto, with certain exceptions. Concurrently with the filing of this application letters and tele - grams from commercial clubs, shippers and others were received urging the Commission to approve these reduced rail rates. Shippers are generally m favor of any freight rate reduction which reduces the delivered cost of commodities bought or sold. In this instance these shippers already enjoy the benefit of the truck rates which Nebraska railroads now seek authority to publish by reducing the higher rail rates. During the strike of truck employes there has been considerable interference and, at times, stoppage of truck trans - portation. Where shippers who usually patronize highway carriers were forced to ship by rail they have been forced to pay higher freight charges for a rail service which, m many instances, was and is inferior to truck service or no better than normal truck service. Shippers would obviously find it to their advantage to have alternative trans - portation services by rail and by truck at the same freight rate. The Nebraska Commercial Truckers Association protested the granting of the application and asked that hearings be held before any action was taken. The grounds of the protest were general referring to the recent granting of increases m rail rates because of inadequate railroad revenues and expressing the fear that equali - zation of rail and truck rates would tend to give Nebraska railroads a transportation monopoly at the expense of unjustifiable reductions m railroad earnings. The Association protest was supported by telegrams from some individual truck lines, members of the Asso- 89 </seg>
            <seg id="p090">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL, REPORT ciation. Two truck operators who are directors of the Nebraska Commercial Truckers Association expressed approval of equalization of rail and truck rates and classification and urged the Commission to authorize an increase m truck rates and charges up to the railroad rate level. We do not know to what extent this viewpoint is shared by other truck lines. The question thus presented is by no means a new issue. In the hearings m Resolution No. 140, In the Matter of the Prescription of Reasonable Rates and Charges for Motor Carriers of Property for Hire; a considerable group of Nebraska truck operators recommended the establishment of truck rates on the rail rate and classification basis. The Opinion of the Commission criticises existing railroad and truck classifications and shows the need for revision and simplifi - cation of freight classification, applicable to both the railroads and competing truck lines. On the question of rate structure we said: "As heretofore stated the truck rates now charged by Ne - braska truckers are m a chaotic condition. There is no generally, maintained schedule of voluntary truck rates which might be prescribed as just and reasonable for future application. Even the larger operators do not publish and enforce such a tariff. In the absence of .my prescribed basis of rates supported by legal sanctions truck operators have been free to compete for traffic against both the railroads and other truckers using price cutting and rebating methods as well as furnishing store door to store door service gen - erally equal to, and sometimes better than, that afforded by the Railway Express Agency." * " *. • * * "Such competition had demoralized normal rate structures and has greatly reduced the revenues received for transpor - tation of commodities most affected by this competitive struggle of transportation agencies. After the injurious effects of excessive and unregulated competition had become apparent to truck operators as veil as the railroads and the present law has passed it is not surprising that many truckers proposed the adoption of the normal railroad rates and Western Classification as a base for both truck and rail - road rates m Nebraska. Practically all Nebraska railroad rates, state and interstate, have baen prescribed or approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Nebraska State Railway Commission. Most of such rates on both merchandise and agricultural commodities have been based on a scale of mileage or distance rates. Many truckers contended that the truck rates should be the exact amount of the railroad rate between any two given points, e.g. from Omaha to Lincoln, Grand Island, McCook and North Platte. 90 </seg>
            <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Others urged that the railroad scale of rates should be applied for the highway distance traveled by trucks between any two given points. There was some precedent for these proposals m the action taken by state railroad commissions m other states. The Kansas Corporation Commission pre - scribed 'common carrier' rates applicable as just and reason - able maxima for hauls of equal length via either highway or railway. Provision was made for using the shortest mileage via highways or railroads to determine competitive rates. Both the railroads and truckers were required to supply the Western Classification and Exceptions thereto between all points m Kansas. The result has been the filing of railroad and truck tariffs naming class rates and classification ratings which are identical. "In Colorado and South Dakota the Western Classification and Exceptions were generally approved for use by motor vehicle common carriers and m Colorado the truck rate structure has gradually been adjusted to produce rate" equality for the competing railroads and truck operators. In South Dakota the truck rates were fixed on a basis slightly lower than the rail rates." In the opinion we specifically pointed out two fundamental objections to the use of rail rates for truck transportation. Rail rates are applied between origin- and destination groups for hauls up to 2,000 miles m length m a territory extending from the Atlantic seaboard to the Rocky Mountains. The rail rate structure was pri - marily designed to serve the needs of long haul railroad transpor - tation. Rail transportation between Nebraska points is confined to railroad lines which embrace much less total mileages than Ne - braska highways used by trucks. The routes open to railroads and trucks between many points m this state represent such differences m mileages and transportation service that the same rate for rail and truck transportation would be unjust to either the carriers involved or the shippers. For example, the rail distance from Ericson to O'Neill is 407 miles compared with a highway distance of 55 miles. In such an instance the railroad cannot expect to haul general merchandise over such a circuitous route m competition with the truck line over short highway routes. It would be absurd to base truck rates on the extremely long rail haul from Ericson to O'Neill. Railroad publication of the Ericson to O'Neill truck rate would be equally absurd because the rail lines could not possibly furnish competitive service. In filing this application Nebraska railroads have restricted their proposed truck competitive rates to apply between points served by reasonably direct rail mileage and to lines where they may reasonably 91 </seg>
            <seg id="p092">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT hope to provide good service m an effort to attract traffic. There has been nation wide discussion as to the "proper" com - petitive sphere for truck service m competition with the railroads. Truck line operators have generally shown a disposition to let shippers settle this question, by choice of rail or truck transportation on a system of rates by truck no lower than those applicable by rail. Under orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission rail rate levels have been fixed as minimum rates for truck transportation m New England and m Central Freight Association territories m Motor Carrier Rates m New England 8 M.C.C. 548 and Motor Carrier Rates m Central Territory S M.C.C. 230. The rail rate minimum was pro - posed by the truck lines m the cases cited. There is now pending before the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion I.C.C. Docket Ex Parte M.C.-23 involving proposals for fixing minimum truck rates m all Western Trunk Line territory on and east of U.S. Highway No. 81 based on the railroad groupings and rate levels. In this case truck lines are urging the Interstate Commerce Commission to fix railroad rates as minimum truck rates. In other words, important Nebraska truck lines, members of the Nebraska Commercial Truckers Association propose railroad rates as a minimum for interstate application m I.C.C. Docket M.C.-23, but oppose this application for similar equalization of rail and truck rates by reducing rail rates to the prescribed truck rate level fixed m Resolution No. 14G between selected Nebraska origin and destination points which the applicant railroads have selected for a further experiment to determine whether they can meet truck competition at equal rates and classification ratings. We conclude that Nebraska shippers arc entitled to enjoy such an opportunity to decide this question, based on the service which these competing carriers by rail and by truck are able to furnish, making their choice of a trans - portation agency by reference to service and not based on lower freight rates. We believe our approval of this proposal is m har - mony with the legislative declaration of policy m L. B. 178 wherein we are instructed to preserve the inherent advantages of truck and rail transportation agencies and prevent unfair or destructive competi - tive practices. We turn now to a discussion of the more important details of the application herein. The applicant railroads state that the rates sought are below reasonable maximum rates and are for the pui-pose of meeting com - petition. They are hopeful that while the proposal represents re - ductions from the present rail carrier rates that the increased traffic which they expect to get as a result of the establishment of such reduced rates will yield needed increases m revenue.

Said new schedule of- rates was filed with our Rate Department on December 19, 1938. A large number of telegrams were received urging quick and favorable action by the' Commission and without a hearing being set for consideration of the matter. Q.uite immediately after filing of these rates the Commission received a protest and request for a hearing, the same being filed by officials of the Nebraska Commercial Truckers Association. The matter came before the Commission, sitting m Executive Session, December 23, 1938. In the brief time given the matter at said Executive Session, it was argued by my colleagues that if a hearing were held that it would result m a great many truckers and railway attorneys coming to attend said hearing, some from so far as Chicago and St. Louis, and further that it would be a long drawn out hearing about some - thing that their minds had already been made up about.

J., ROSE, EBERLY, PAINE, CARTER AND MESSMORE, JJ., and ELDRED, District Judge. ROSE, J. This is an action at law to recover alleged overcharges exacted by defendant from plaintiff for transporting carloads of sand and gravel by rail from Allis, Nebraska, to Omaha. Plaintiff, Fred F. Shields Company, operated a sand and gravel pit at Allis. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, defendant, operates a railroad between Allis and Omaha. 97 </seg>
            <seg id="p098">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT The substance of the claim for damages is that defendant, beginning March 17, 1931, and continuing through October 31, 1931, charged and received an excessive freight rate of 60 cents a ton for carload shipments of sand and gravel from Allis to Omaha, instead of the lawful rate of 45 cents a ton, the gross charges and payments for that period being $11,750.83 and the aggregate for lawful charges being $8,813.34, making the overcharges $2,937.49, for which judg - ment is demanded. The shipments and freight charges exacted are enumerated m the petition. The answer of defendant denied that an excessive rate was charged or paid for plaintiff's shipments of sand and gravel m car - loads from Allis to Omaha during the period between and including March 17, 1931, and October 31, 1931, and alleged that the lawful freight rate for such shipments, as incorporated m the published tariffs, schedules and classifications filed with and fixed by the Nebraska state railway commission, was three cents a hundred weight or 60 cents a ton. The facts on which each party relies are stated m detail m the respective pleadings. A jury was waived and the cause tried before the district court. There was a general finding m favor of defendant, and the action was dismissed. Plaintiff appealed. The controversy over the rate for shipments of sand and gravel from Allis to Omaha arose from diverse views of the parties on the rate actually fixed by the Nebraska state railway commission for the transportation services performed by defendant for plaintiff be - tween and including the dates March 17, 1931, and October 31, 1931. The power to fix the intrastate freight rates for common carriers was committed by Constitution and statute to the commission. The position of plaintiff is that the legal rate m controversy was 45 cents a ton from Allis to Omaha. The contention of defendant is that it was 60 cents a ton between those places. The solution of the problem must be found m the records of the rate-making body called for convenience the "Commission". The undisputed evidence is that the commission, December 4, 1923, authorized the rate of three cents a hundred weight, or 60 cents a ton, on sand and gravel from Allis to Omaha, the rate paid by plain - tiff. That rate appeared m the published tariffs, schedules and classifications of defendant and was effective January 15, 1924. Prior to plaintiff's shipments there was no specific order of the commission changing or modifying m direct terms the 60-cent rate from Allis to Omaha. That rate remained continuously m force throughout the period of plaintiff's claim unless a .valid change was authorized by the commission. Comp. St. 1929, sec. 75-712; Katz-Craig 98 </seg>
            <seg id="p099">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Contracting Co. v. Chicago, St. P., M. &amp; O. E. Co., 93 Neb. 674, 141 N. W. 1131. The view which plaintiff takes of the record is that the com - mission changed the 60-cent rate on sand and gravel from Allis to Omaha to 45 cents and that the latter rate applied to the shipments for which the higher rate was charged and paid. The proofs show clearly that, on application of defendant, the commission made an order dated May 28, 1931, effective the same day, fixing the rate on sand and gravel from Allis to Ralston at 45 cents a ton. There was elaborate argument by plaintiff on tha propositions that the com - mission considered Omaha the same as Ralston for the purpose of this 45-cent rate which, as asserted, should have read Allis to Omaha; that by order of the commission Ralston had been abandoned as a regular railroad station and the mileage to and from that point eliminated j from the tariffs and Omaha substituted for Ralston for the purpose of distances and rates; that the commission had put Ralston in the Omaha switching district, where it became a part thereof, making the 45-cent rate the rate to Omaha. In the advocacy supporting these propositions, there is emphasis on the fact that the original rate was GO cents a ton to both Ralston and Omaha and that defendant was directed by formal order of the commission November 18, 1929, "To revise and amend its tariffs in such a manner as to include what is now known as 'Ralston' within the switching district of Omaha and South Omaha, and to list as in accordance with proposed tariffs, now filed with the commission, Ralston industries as being within the Omaha-South Omaha switching district, and to carry such industries in its switching tariffs." The order also directed defendant to remove the name of Ralston as a station from its table of official distances and to cancel any and all class and commodity rates published specifically between Ralston and other stations in Nebraska. However plausible the argument on these propositions may be regarded, the deduction of plaintiff is refuted by undisputed facts and the law applicable thereto. The haul from Allis to Omaha is 7.6 miles longer than to Ralston. While plaintiff's carloads of sand and gravel were being transported to Omaha during 1931, Ralston was a shipping point, where there were local side-tracks, stockyards and a station-house in charge of an agent. The service of the carrier was greater to Omaha than to Ralston. The switching expenses of defendant at Omaha were greater than for local switching at Ralston. The latter is an incorporated village outside the city limits of Omaha. The switching facilities at the 1 two points of destination were differ - ent. The application for a reduced rate to Ralston, without chang - ing the fixed 60-cent rate to Omaha, was made by defendant. The department of public works in charge of public-road building joined 99 </seg>
            <seg id="p100">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT m the application for the purpose of procuring a reduced rate on sand and gravel to Ralston where vast quantities of those materials were required for the paving of public highways. Defendant was confronted by an emergency created by the competition of trucks and, to meet it, demanded the 45-cent rate to Ralston without asking for any re - duction m the 60-cent rate to Omaha. The commission declared an emergency, made the reduced rate effective May 28, 1931, and pro - vided that it should expire December 31, 1931, unless sooner changed or cancelled. This action was taken after Kalston had been canceled as a regular station and had been included m the Omaha switching district. It is well-settled law that a rate-making commission may make a difference m rates from the initial shipping point to different places m the same switching district, where the difference m conditions so warrants. The emergency order reducing the rate from 60 cents a ton to 45 cents a ton on shipments from Allis to Ralston without disturbing the CO-cent rate to Omaha is clear. The same reduction of the rate to Omaha is not implied by orders and records of the commission or by conditions and circum - stances. A 45-cent rate to Omaha was not published m the tariffs. In the proper view of the entire record, there were no overcharges on the shipments enumerated m plaintiff's claim. The dismissal below, therefore, is supported by the evidence and is free .from error. ; . AFFIRMED. 100 </seg>

Prior to that, certain employees were devoting time to regulation of motor carriers under previously enacted statutes, rules and regulations of the Commission. A law enforcement division was created, consisting of one chief and five subordinate inspectors. After an instruction period, the inspectors were sent to various counties for purpose of establishing local county motor carrier associations. The objectives were: (1) Through the medium of county associations the inspectors could by means of informal conferences, advise the carriers of the require - ments of the law and its administration by the Commission, (2) Pro - vide a quick means of informing carriers of any proposed orders, rules, and regulations that would in any wise effect their operations. This program was conducted from March 1, 1938, to June 1, 1938, after which time each inspector was assigned a territory for purpose of as - suming their regular duties of enforcing the laws in respect to motor carrier operations. Motor carriers subject to the Motor Carriers Act of 1937, were required to appear at hearings on their applications before an ex - aminer from the Commission to submit proof of operation as of April 1, 1936. Applicants who could not establish proof of operation as of April 1, 1936 (the date specifically provided for under the Act), were required to prove that the convenience and necessity of the public justified their operations, and were further required to establish their fitness, willingness, and ability to conduct said oper - ations. Requirements as to insurance coverage, as prescribed in General Order No. 73, (See Thirtieth Annual Report for 1937, page 143), had to be met, before a certificate of convenience and necessity was issued. 148 </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The Commission prescribed rates for motor carriers of property •who are operating under its jurisdiction, and the duties of the in - spectors was, and is, to determine whether or not insurance re - quirements are complied with, and the proper rates assessed and collected, and to instigate necessary prosecutions for violations. The Nebraska Motor Carrier's Act expressly provided that cer - tain movements of property, even when for hire, would be exempt from any regulation by the Commission. However, in some instances it was necessary to first establish an interpretation. See Application No. M-2084, "In the matter of the application of Ralph C. Rodgers, Milford, Nebraska, for a certificate to operate as a common carrier of property, under Resolution No. 141 of the Nebraska State Railway Commission", at page 241, this report, and Supreme Court of Nebraska, "Ralph C. Rodgers v. Nebraska State Railway Commission", at page 254. Under the Motor Carrier's Act, it could not be clearly determined whether or not the Commission had jurisdiction over the type of motor carrier operation consisting of motor carriers of property who transported their own merchandise or products for money compen - sation. In this respect, see Resolution No. 1-49, at page 240, this report. Motor carriers operating for passengers for hire, have been under the jurisdiction of the Commission for several years, and the Commission is empowered by the Motor Carrier's Act to prescribe reasonable fares for passenger carriers. Fixing of fares for all pas - senger carriers, was not possible at the close of 1938. Schedule of fares for taxicabs in the city of Lincoln was established by agreement of the parties. All motor transportation companies and common car - riers of passengers other than taxicabs are required to file rate schedules with the Commission, and the schedules are subsequently approved. All common carriers operating motor vehicles for passenger hire under the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission are required to file insurance coverage depending upon the rated capacity of the vehicles operated. Insurance policies must be filed with the attached Nebraska endorsement as prescribed by the Commission for taxicabs and public cars in Resolution No. 137, and for busses operated by motor transportation companies in Resolution No. 102, Supplement No. 4. 149 </seg>
            <seg id="p150">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT (A) MOTOR TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES Under this general classification are included motor carriers operating motor vehicles for passenger hire over fixed routes and between fixed termini in Nebraska Intrastate Commerce. A list of the applications received by the Commission, from this type of carrier, appears below. These applications, when granted, authorized the transportation of passengers, baggage, mail and express. The lack of a clear and concise definition of the word "express" caused some difficulty, and complaints were received in reference thereto. See Resolution No. 14C, at page 266.

            <seg id="p242">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the Matter of the Application ) of Ralph C. Rodgers, Milford, ) Nebraska, for a certificate to ) operate as a common carrier of ) APPLICATION NO. M-2084 property, under Resolution No. 141 ) of the Nebraska State Railway ) Commission. &gt; OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: Ralph C. Rodgers made application under our Resolution No. 141 for a certificate to operate as a common carrier of property. Sub - sequent to his application, the Legislature of 1937 passed L. B. 178 establishing a comprehensive system of regulation over both common and contract carriers and vesting the same m this Commission. While it was not necessary, under our rulings, that a new application should be filed, the applicant's status is, of course, to be determined under the provisions of L. B. 178 and it was agreed that evidence a? to the character of applicant's operations might be taken and that the Commission might rule upon the applicant's claim for an exempt - ed status at this time. The applicant's claim for exemption is based upon two prop - ositions; First, he claims that since Section 20 of Article IV of the Con - stitution bestows certain definite regulatory powers upon the Com - mission as to common carriers, this jurisdiction may not be enlarged by the Legislature so as to comprehend contract carriers as well. We will not discuss this claim m detail and will simply dismiss the same with the statement that m our judgement it is not well found - ed. The Railway Commission has had many duties imposed upon it besides those provided for m the Constitutional provision and we think it well established that additional statutory duties may be devolved upon the Commission as well as upon any other department of state. Second, an exemption is claimed under the provisions of Section 3, Sub-division (d) of L. B. 178, a copy of which is set forth m the margin *. There is no dispute as to the facts. The applicant Rodgers is engaged m the hauling of milk and cream on a regular route, pick - ing up the milk and cream at farms. No milk or cream is picked up or transported elsewhere. The milk and cream is delivered by appli - cant to either the Roberts Dairy or Beatrice Creamery Company 242 </seg>
            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION at Lincoln. The applicant is paid by the creamery or dairy twice each month. The dairy or creamery deducts from the payment for the milk or cream due the farmers, a certain percentage which is paid applicant for hauling. Nothing is hauled m return movement other than the empty containers which are delivered to the farms from which they were taken when filled with milk or cream. Applicant solicits business for hauling to the creamery or dairy. Some times he calls to see the farmers on his own volition or is told to see the farmers by the creamery or dairy. Sometimes farmers come to appli - cant and ask him to transport their cream or milk. Applicant picks up the milk at the farms every morning, gives no receipt for it, does not use or have any record of the number of gallons hauled. He receives his check from the creamery or dairy but the money he receives is derived from deductions made from the payments due the farmers. * No provision of this Act or order of the Commission shall apply to motor vehicle owners who may be employed by farmers when hauling their crop to the local market.

Applicant carries and pays for personal liability insurance bnt carries no cargo insurance. He testified that he would be responsible for and pay cargo losses. We think it is clearly apparent that the applicant is not an employee of either the farmers whose milk and cream he hauls or of the dairy or creamery to which the same is hauled. He iB an in - dependant contractor operating as a carrier for hire. While applicant's claim for exemption is particularly directed xo a single clause m the sub-division to which we have above re - ferred, we think it fair to him to discuss each of the exemptions which are afforded by said sub-division. 243 </seg>
            <seg id="p244">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT It is self evident that the first provision for exemption could not apply to applicant. This provision is as follows: "No provision of this act or order of the Commission shall apply to motor vehicle owners who may be employed by farmers when hauling their crops to the local market." The word "crops" has a definite meaning m common usage and is applied only to products of the soil, - that is such plants or their pro - ducts as are actually nourished by, or grown from the earth We cannot concerns that it was the intention of the Legislature to include milk or cream therein. Likewise, the last provision of the sub-division is, as we believe wholly inapplicable. This provides: "Nor shall any provision apply to motor vehicles owned and operated by any industrial processing or manufacturing plant when used by such plant m the m the transportation of raw materials and supplies to its plant or plants or m the delivery of its products, supplies or raw materials to purchasers thereof when not for hire."

This provision is of course, not applicable to applicant's situation be - cause^ as above noted, the vehicles m question are owned neither by the JEftSm? «. ° r creamer y but fa y *c operator himself.

            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION It is insisted by the applicant that this provision affords entire exemp - tion to him since his motor vehicles are used exclusively m carrying for hire agricultural commodities. There are a number of propositions which should be considered m connection with proper construction of this provision. In the first place, it should be noted that the words, "to and from any farm or ranch," are used at the end of the clause. It seems but natural that this clause should be carried back to and construed with all the terms immedi - ately preceding the same, since those terms are connected with the disjunctive, "or". Thus read, an exemption would be accorded to vehicles, used exclusively m carrying for hire agricultural commodities, but only to and from any farm or ranch and not generally. This seems but reasonable. It was undoubtedly the intention of the Leg - islature to accord an agriculture exemption, that is, an exemption to those engaged m agriculture, but it was not intended that transportation of all agricultural commodities, such as, for example, potatoes, from market to market or generally m commerce, should be exempted. The view has been expressed that it was the intention of the Leg - islature, by this provision, to limit the exemption of the transportation of agricultural products to movements between farm and farm. There is a great deal of merit m this contention. The Legislature had already, m two previous clauses, defined and providted for an agricul - tural exemption. A general exemption is granted to farmers and their employees when hauling ranch, dairy or farm products and supplies from or to their ranches, farms, dairies or creameries, m motor vehicles owned and operated by them. In another previous provision, exemption is accorded to motor vehicle owners who may be employed by farmers when hauling their crops to the local market. These two provisions, taken together, constitute an agricultural exemption more liberal andi exten - sive than any which has been upheld m the courts. It is, therefore, not to be thought that the Legislature, having already been so liberal m its agricultural exemption, would so far extend the same as would be called for by applicant's contention. The suggested construction, however, limits the exemption which we are now discussing to movements be - tween farm and farm exempts a limited movement, applicable to the transportation of livestock for feed or fattening, emergency 'trans - portation of feeds and fertilizers, and the like, m hired vehicles. If, however, it is necessary to construe the clause m question, to - wit: "to and from any farm or ranch" to mean any operation originat - ing at or terminating at the ranch or farm, that is, a farm to market or market to farm movement, then we must consider the intention of the Legislature m the use of the term "agricultural commodities." Commodities are, generally speaking, anything which may be - come the subject of sale. 245 </seg>
            <seg id="p246">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT "Commodities 'are the productions of a country which become articles of sale, or m the language of Webster m his dictionary m commerce, including everything movable that is bought and sold, unless, perhaps, animals may be excepted. The word in - cludes all the movables which are the objects of commerce." Best vs. Bander, N. Y. 29 How. Prac. 489, 492, (Words &amp; Phrases, First Series, Vol. 2, p. 1309) The phrase, therefore, turns upon the meaning of the word "agri - cultural" That term m its orginal or primary significance connotes connection with the soil. The word is derived from the Latin "ager", which means a field. Agriculture, m its primary sense, is the tilling of the soil. Used m such sense, agricultural commodities does not include animals or their products. "In ordinary usage, the term "agricultural products" is confin - • ed to the yield of soil, as corn, wheat, rye, hay, etc m its pri - mary form. Thus Code, 1605, providing that a municipal corporation shall not levy or assess a tax on any "agricultural products," does not exempt beef cattle. Davis v. City of Macon, 64 Ga. 128, 134, 37 Am. Rep. 60." There is a broader sense m which the term "agricultural" is often used. Grazing or animal husbandry goes hand m hand with the till - ing of the soil and constitutes with it a part of the usual and ordinary farm operations. The term "agricultural" has, therefore, been extended to include such operations. For instance, it has been said* "The common parlance of the country and the common practice of the country have been to consider all those things as farming products or agricultural products which have the situs of their production upon the farm, or which are brought into condition for the uses of society by the labor of those engaged m agricultural pursuits. The products of the dairy and the product of the poultry yard, while it does not come directly out of the soil, is necessarily connected with the soil and those who are engaged m the culture of the soil." District of Columbia v. Oyster, 15 D.C. 285, 286, 54 Am. Rep. 275. See Words &amp; Phrases, Third Series, Vol. 1, pp. 379-380; The question presented, therefore, is whether the Legislature in - tended to use the term "agricultural commodities" m its broad sense or m a narrower and more restricted sense. If the term "agricultural commodities" was intended to be used m its broad sense, it is broad enough to include livestock as well as dairy products. It is to be noted, however, that m this same subdivision there is a specific clause dealing with exemption as to dairy products and there is also a specific exemption as to livestock. It occurs to us 246 </seg>
            <seg id="p247">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION that had the Legislature intended that the term "agricultural com - modities be used m its broad sense, it would not have included specific exemptions, both as to dairy products and to livestock, m the same subdivision. Stated differently, if the construction contended for by applicant is the proper construction, then this clause alone would be sufficient to exempt not only dairy products, but livestock and all other agricultural commodities as well,, and no other specific provisions would be necessary. However, before adopting any construction of this statute, for application to the instant case, we think it proper to consider whether or not the construction which we are asked to adopt is m conflict either with our own Constitution or with the Constitution of the United States, both of which prohibit discrimination. It is axiomatic that, if it is possible to give two distinct interpre - tations to a statute, one of which is constitutional and the other uncon - stitutional, that construction should be adopted which will render the statute constitutional. If we adopt the construction of the statute m question which the applicant asks us to do, we must con - strue it as exempting all motor vehicles used exclusively for the trans - portation of agricultural products, whether such vehicles be owned and operated by the producers or whether they are vehicles operated for Hrp. by common or contract carriers. It is self-evident that such an exemption added to the previous exemption • will operate to exclude from regulation all truck operations having to do with agricultural products or commodities. Such oper - ations would be completely exempted from the requirement of a certificate of convenience and necessity or of a permit for operation, as well as from all insurance and safety regulations. In the case of Smith v. Cahoon, 283 U. S. 553, 75 L. cd. 1264, the Supreme Court of the United States considered the validity of the Florida statute regulating carrier by motor vehicle. In the act there was an exemption which is thus stated m the opinion: "*•♦ The act provides that the term auto transportation com - pany, upon which the obligations of the act are imposed, shall not include 'any transportation company engaged exclusively m the transporting (of) agricultural, horticultural, dairy or other farm products and fresh and salt fish and oysters and shrimp from the point of production to the assembling or shipping point en route to primary market or to motor vehicles used exclusively m transporting or delivering dairy pro - ducts' " (p. 1274) The court says m regard to this exemption that, m establishing such a regulation, "there does not appear to be the slightest justifi- 247 </seg>
            <seg id="p248">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT cation for making a distinction between those who carry for hire farm products, or milk or butter, or fish or oysters, and those who carry for hire bread or sugar, or tea or coffee, or groceries m general, or other useful commodities. So far as the statute was designed to safeguard the public with respect to the use of the highways, we think that, the dis - crimination it makes between the private carriers which are relieved of the necessity of obtaining certificates and giving security, and a carrier such as the appellant, was wholly arbitrary and constituted a violation of the appellant's constitutional right." (p. 1274) *No provision of this act or order of the Commission shall apply to motor vehicles owned and operated by farmers, ranchers, dairymen or a creamery, or their employees, when hauling ranch, dairy or farm pro - ducts and supplies from and to their ranches, farms, dairies or cream - eries, or m a bonafide exchange of work with their neighbors. In the case of Continental Baking Company v. Woodring, 286, U. S. 352, 76 L. cd. 1155, the Supreme Court of the United States had under consideration the Kansas Motor Vehicle Act of 1931 which im - posed a tax on motor vehicle carriers on the basis of gross ton miles operated. There was an exemption m the statute which applied to "the transportation of livestock and farm products to market by the owner thereof or supplies for his own use m his own motor vehicle." (p. 1166). The court, m contrasting this exemption with the exemption con - tained m Smith v. Cahoon, supra, says: "The distinction m the instant case is of a different sort. The statute does not attempt to impose an arbitrary discrimination between carriers who transport property for hire, or com - pensation, with respect to the class of products they carry. The exemption runs only to one who is carrying his own live - stock and farm products to market or supplies for his own use m his own motor vehicle. •**" (p. 1167) It is to be noted at this point that the exemption m question is very much the same as the specific exemption to farmers and their employees m our own statute, which has heretofore been referred to. In the case of Hicklin v. Coney, 290 U. S. 169, 78 L. cd. 247, the Supreme Court of the United States considered the South Carolina regulatory act affecting transportation by motor vehicles. This con - tained a provision exempting farmers or dairymen hauling dairy or farm products. In considering this exemption, the court, after referring to the decision m Smith v. Cahoon, above set out, said: "In Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, supra (286 U. S. pp. 372, 373, 76 L. cd. 1166, 1167, 52 S. Ct. 595, 81 A. L. R. 1402) 248 </seg>
            <seg id="p249">249 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the statutory exemption ran to one 'who is carrying his own livestock and farm products to market or supplies for his own use in his own motor vehicles.' Attention was called to the factual basis for the distinction as it had been pointed out by the District Court, which found a practical difference between the case of those 'who operate fleets of trucks in the conduct of their business and who use the highways daily in the delivery of their products to their customers' and that of 'a farmer who hauls his wheat or livestock to town once a twice a year.' This Court said that the legislature in making its classification was entitled to consider frequency and character of use and to adapt its regulations to the classes of operations which by reason of their habitual and constant use of the highways brought about the conditions making regulation imperative and created the necessity for the imposition of a tax for maintenance and reconstruction. The Court quoted the obser - vation in Alward v. Johnson, 282 U. S. 509, 513, 514, 75 L. cd. 49G, 499, 51 S. Ct. 273, 75 A. L. R. 8: 'The distinction between property employed in conducting a business which requires constant and unusual use of. the highways, and property not so employed, is plain enough'.' "'The exemption in the instant case are not as limited as that in Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, but they differ mat - erially from that found to be objectionable in Smith v. Cahoon, 283 U. S. 553, 75 L. ed. 1264, 51 S. Ct. 582. The state court thus consti-ucd the scope, and described the effect, of the exemption in favor of farmers and dairymen: 'Unquestion - able, the use by farmers and dairymen for the transportation of farm and dairy products is seasonal and involves only a moderate use of the highways; and the exemption here is further limited by the fact that it can apply only to one whose principal business is that of a farmer or dairyman and not to one merely incidentally 'engaged in farming or dairy - ing.' Further, in its pleading, the Railroad Commission aver - red that it had uniformly construed the statute 'as exempting farmers and dairymen only when hauling their own products, or only when hauling them occasionally and not as a regular business' and had adopted a formal regulation to that effect. In support of its pleading and made a part of it, the Com - mission presented an affidavit by the Sunerintendent of the Motor Transportation Division of the Commission showing the manner in which the statute had been applied. "The state court in its opinoin said that it reached its conclusion as to the validity of the statutory provision 'in - dependently of the construction placed by the Railroad Com - mission upon the contested provision of the Act.' And the </seg>
            <seg id="p250">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT court pointed out that that construction was 'm part* un - sound inasmuch as 'one hauling his own products m his own motor vehicle' did not come within the purview of the act and no provision for his exemption was necessary. "The ex - emption, 'said the court, 'can refer only to farmers and dairy - men hauling farm and dairy products for compensation.' The state court, however, did not express disagreement with the Commission's construction set forth m its regulation, that the exemption applied 'to farmers and dairymen who occasionally, but do not regularly, as a part of an established business, haul farm and/or dairy products for others for hire, but that persons who may also be engaged m part m farming oper - ations but who make a regular business of transporting farm and/or dairy or other products for others for hire are not to be deemed farmers or dairymen for the purpose of this Act, and hence are required to comply with the Act, m all re - spects like other persons engaged m motor transportation for hire.' Nor have we anything before us to show that thp statute is being enforced and the exemption construed m other sense. Upon the present record, it appears that the exemption is applied with two limitations, first, that, as con - strued by the state court, it can refer only 'to one whose prin - cipal business is that of a farmer or dairyman and hot to one merely incidentally engaged m farming or dairying:,' and, second, under the construction of the Commission m enforc - ing the statute - - a construction not disapproved by the state court - - that it applies only to farmers and dairymen who occasionally, and not as regular business, transport farm or dairy products for compensation : We cannot say that a class - ification based on such a use of the highways is an arbitrary one and thus encounters constitutional objection." (pp. 251 and 252) The final word m this discussion, so far as we are advised, vns spoken by the United States Supreme Court through Mr. Justice Cnv - dozo m the case of Aero Mayflower Transit Company v. Georgia Public Service Commission, 205 U. S. 285, 70 L. cd. 1439. This had to do with the validity of a statute of Georgia regulating private carriers for hire, common carriers being subject to the provisions of a separate statute. The carrier obtained a ccrificate of convenience and neces - sity and raid the statutory fee of $35.00 therefor. It gave approver! security for the protection of its customers and the public m the event of injury through negligence, and contested merely the validity of the requirements that for every motor vehicle it must pay an annual fee of 525.00 m order to obtain a license. These fees were to be placed m the state treasury, subject to the control of the State Highway Depart - ment, and devoted to the maintenance and repair of the highways of 250 </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the state. The act contains an express exemption which is thus stated in the. opinion: "It does not apply to 'motor vehicles engaged exclusively in the transportation of agricultural and/or dairy products be - tween any of the following points: farm, market, gin, ware - house, or mill, where the weight of the load does not exceed 10,000 pounds, whether such motor vehicle is owned by the owner or producer of such agricultural or dairy products or not, so long as the title remains in the producer." (p.1442) The court was extremely careful to point out that in this case it was dealing with the matter of exemption from taxation and to dis - tinguish the situation thus presented from that presented in Smith v. Cahoon, supra, where the exemption was from the general regula - tory provisions of the act. While the court upheld the exemption so far as the tax was concerned, it did not express any opinion as to the validity of the provision as regards general regulatory provisions, such as those calling for a certificate or a permit, or requiring insurance and compliance with safety requirements. The situation presented by our own statute is distinctly different from that presented in the Georgia Public Service Commission case. We are confronted here with an exemption which affects not only the matter of taxation, but also the issuance of certificates or permits, the matter of insurance, and the matter of compliance with safety regulations. Again the fees which are exacted by our statute are not for the purpose of supplying money for the construction and maintenance of the public highways, but are strictly regulatory fees, and it is expressly provided by the act that the annual fees shall not exceed the amount actually necessary to sustain the administration and enforcement of the act. We cannot see how the provision for taxation could be placed upon any other basis than the other provisions of the act so far as reasonableness is concerned. The fee is a small one, designed only to cover the actual expense of regulation, and if any group be exempted from that fee the expense of regulating such group as to the other re - quirements of the act must, of necessity, be borne by those carriers not included in the group. In its most favorable aspect, however, the Georgia Public Service Commission case does not, as we view it, go beyond the exemption sustained in the Woodring case, nor indeed beyond the specific exemp - tion contained in our own statute as to farmers and their employees, to which we have referred above. We take the doctrine of these cases to be this: That while it may be entirely proper to exempt from the operation of our law the oper - ations of farmers from farm to market, conducted in their own trucks, by themselves or their employees, and as to their own products, the 251 </seg>
            <seg id="p252">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT Legislature may not provide for a general immunity from regulation as to agricultural commodities when transported by carriers for hire, and we are satisfied that if we were to give to the clause which we are discussing ths interpretation which the applicant asks us to do, we would ; be giving it an interpretation which would result m its being held to be discriminatory, and, therefore, invalid.

"No provision of this act or order of the Commissin shall apply ***to motor vehicles used exclusively m carrying for hire livestock or agricultural commodities or other commodities used m the production of agricultural products to and from any farm or ranch;" The only question presented is whether milk is an agricultural commodily. If it is, the applicant is exempt. If it is not, he is not ex - enip:. By a strained and painful process of reasoning, mv collogues say that milk is not an agricultural commodity Having lived on the farm before the advent of milking machines, I know that it is an agricultural commodity. 1 know that every member of the 1937 Leg - islature will agree with me. I know that every hundred persons that you meet on main street will agree with me. The language of Section 3 (d) of the act shows a clear intention to exempt every carrier of property that is transported from or to any farm or ranch. It is clearly an agricultural exemption. I drafted Legislative Bill No. 178. I did not draft the agricul - tural exemptions. It was my intention to draft a bill which would secure uniformity with the Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935. Leg - islative Bill No. 17S conforms wherever possible to the language of the federal act. Where the Interstate Commerce Commission has construed any term of the federal act, this Commission, if possible, should adopt the same construction; otherwise we will have chaos be - hve:n the state and federal jurisdiction. In Section 203 (b), (4a) and (6) of the Federal Act appears the term "agricultural commodities". In Administrative Ruling No. 45. the Interstate Commerce Commission holds: "The term "Agricultural Commodities" as used m Section 203 (b) (G) is interpreted to include dairy products but not the manufactured products, therof." Again, m Ruling G3, the Interstate Commerce Commission holds: "Vehicles engaged exclusively m the transportation or raw milk to market and empty cans back to the farms, poultry from the farms to markets and empty crates back to the farms are exempt under Section 203 (b) (6) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935." In construing a statute our courts have uniformly held: "In the interpretation of statutes words m common use are to be construed m their natural, plain and ordinary signifi - cation." 253 </seg>
            <seg id="p254">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT In Gregg v. Mitchell, 166 Fed. 725, the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals m defining a farmer said : "It is well known that all over the country farmers from time to time are changing their lines of industry, the uses to which they put their lands, and give their attention, some times principally to raising grains, some times to grazing, some times to the production of milk, butter and cheese, all according to their judgement as to what is the most profitable way of using their farms."- Then continuing, the court said: "But if, while farming, he establishes, as one of the depart - ments of his industry, a dairy to utilize the products of his farm and convert them to profitable uses, he is none the less a farmer; nor does he cease to be one until he reaches the end by disposing of the ultimate product. His farming bus - iness includes all this. He may sell it at wholesale or at retail, as he finds to his best advantage. We do not think that, m storing his milk and selling it at retail, as he did or if he sold his other products of his farm at retail, he was out of his legitimate sphere as a farmer. He did this, we must sup - pose, because it was the most profitable way of disposing of his products. We know of no reason for putting a strained construction upon this provision of the act, or restricting it Within narrower bounds than the language imports when read m its common meaning." Agriculture is defined m American Jurisprudence, Volume 2, Page 395, as follows: "Tha term agriculture is broader m meaning than 'farm - ing'; and while it includes the preparation of soil, the planting of seeds, the raising and harvesting of horticulture, dairying, . poultry and bee raising." The comprehensiveness of the term agriculture is stated m Dillar v. Webb, 55 Ala. 474, as follows: "The variety of products of the earth, of agricultural implements, and of domestic animals, invited and put on exhibition at agricultural fairs, attests the comprehensive - ness of the 'term 'agriculture. It refers to the field, or farm, with all its wants, appointments, and products, as horticulture refers to the garden, with its less important, though varied, Products." 254 </seg>
            <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In Simons v. Lovell, 7 Heisk (Term.) 576, the court said: "It is equivalent to husbandry, and husbandry, Webster defines to be the business of a farmer, comprehending agri - culture or tillage of the ground, the raising, managing, and fattening of cattle and other domestic animals, the manag - ment of the dairy and whatever the land produces." In District of Columbia v. Oyster, 15 D. C. 285, m denning fanning or agriculture products, the court said: "The common parlance of the country and the common practice of the country have been to consider all those things as farming products or agricultural products which have the situs of their production upon the farm, or which are brought into condition for the uses of society by the labor of those engaged m agricultural pursuits. The products of the dairy and the product of the poultry yard, while it does not come directly out of the soil, is necessarily connected with the soil and those who are engaged m the culture of the soil." Common usage of the term "agricultural commodities" dictionary definitions, the clear intent of the Legislature to exempt all com - modities transported from and to any farm or ranch, the construction given by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the construction given by State and Federal Courts, compel me to dissent from major - ity opinion.

This is an appeal from a decision of the state railway com - mission of Nebraska, m which the commission denied the appellant an exemption as contended for by him under Legislative Bill No. 178, passed by the 1937 session of the unicameral legislature. Laws 1937, eh. 142. The facts are not m dispute. The appellant made application on August 24, 1936, to the state railway commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate as a common carrier of property by a motor ve - hicle under resolution 141 of the state, railway commission, prior to the time Legislative Bill No. 178 became effective on August 16, 1937. Without appellant filing another application, the application so filed was recognized by the commission as effective under the Neb - raska motor carrier act of 1937, that is, Legislative Bill No. 178, and the ruling of the commission -was made m connection with the ad - ministration of said act. Appellant described the route regularly operated by him m his own right as of April 1, 1936, the territory served, from Milford 15 miles north, 20 miles west, 20 miles south, and 7 miles east, and delivery made to Lincoln. He has five trucks each of which is insured from $5,000 to $10,000 for public liability, and $5,000 for property damage, and recognizes his legal obligation for the cargo which he hauls. The appellant is engaged m picking up cream and milk only. At times he solicits the farmers for the privi - lege of hauling their milk and cream, and at other times farmers come to him, requesting him to haul milk and cream for them. The milk and cream so hauled is hauled from the farms of his respective customers to the Roberts Dairy and Beatrice Creamery companies m Lincoln, where the milk and cream are weighed m, the farmers credited with the amount, and the appellant paid twice each month by the dairy and creamery. The title to the milk and cream remains m the farmers until such time as delivery is made to the dairy and creamery. The appellant returns the empty cans to the farms.- He does 257 </seg>
            <seg id="p258">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT not transport any other commodity than milk and cream as aforsaid and m the manner described. The first question for our consideration is: What is meant by agricultural commodities? In the case of District of Columbia v. Oyster, 4 Mackay (D. C.) 285, 54 Am. Rep. 275, m the body of the opinion the court said (p. 286): "But the common parlance of the country, and the common practice of the country, have been to consider all those things as farming products or agricultural products which had the situs of their production upon the farm, and which were brought into condi - tion for the uses of society by the labor of- those engaged m agri - cultural pursuits, as contradistinguished from manufacturing and other industrial pursuits. "The product of the dairy or the product of the poultry yard, while it does not come directly out of the soil, is necessarily con - nected with the soil and with those who are engaged m the culture of the soil. It is, m every sense of the word, a part of the farm product. It is depended upon and looked upon as one of the results and one of the means of income of the farm, and m a just sense, therefore, it may be considered produce." In 2 Am. Jur. 395, sec. 2, speaking of agriculture, it is said: "The term is broader m meaning than 'farming;' and while it includes the preparation of soil, the planting of seeds, the raising and harvesting of crops, and all their incidents, it also includes • * • dairying," To like effect are Gregg v. Mitchell, ICG Fed. 725; Dillard v. Webb, 55 Ala. 468. In the Non-Stock Cooperative Marketing Act (Comp. St. 1929, sec. 24-1401), the Nebraska legislature of 1925 defined the term "agricultural products" as "field crops, horticultural, viticultural, forestry, nut, dairy, live stock, poultry, bee and farm products". Decisions of the courts have adopted the foregoing definition of agricultural commodities or products. We believe that the applicant m this case was engaged m hauling agricultural commodities. This brings us to the question of whether or not the applicant is a common carrier or a contract carrier. The term "contract carrier" was unknown to the common law, and is to be found m comparatively recent statutory enactments. The common law recognizes but two classes of carriers, viz., common carriers and private carriers. The appellee contends that the applicant m this case is a common carrier, subject to regulation by the railway commission under sec- 258 </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION tion 20, art. IV of the constitution which m part follows: "The pow - ers and duties of such commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legis - lature may provide by law. But, m the absence of specific legislation, the commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated m this provision." Section 4 of Legislative Bill No. 178 (Laws 1937, eh. 142) follows: "Jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon and vested m the Commission, and it shall be its duty: (a) To regulate common car - riers by motor vehicle as provided m this Act, and to that end the Commission may establish reasonable requirements with respect to continuous and adequate service, transportation of baggage and express, uniform system of accounts, records, and reports, preserva - tion of records, qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment, (b) To regulate contract carriers by motor vehicle as provided m this Act, and to that end the Commission may establish reasonable requirements with re - spect to uniform system of accounts, records, and reports, preser - vation of records, qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment." Section 2 of legislative Bill No. 178 (Laws 1937, eh. 142) pro - vides as follows: "\i) The term 'common carrier' means any person who or which undertakes to transport passengers or property for the general public m intrastate commerce by motor vehicle for hire, whether over regular or irregular routes, upon the highways of this state, (j) The term 'contract carrier' means any motor carrier transporting passengers or property for hire other than as a common carrier." Appellee cites 10 C. J. 37, as follows: "While a common carrier has been defined as one that holds itself out to the public to carry persons or freight for hire, the term did not, at the common law, embrace a carrier of passengers, and is commonly confined to carriers of goods, as distinguished from common carriers of passengers. A common carrier differs from a private carrier m two important re - spects: (1) In respect of duty, it being obliged by law to undertake the charge of transportation, which none but a common carrier, with - out a special agreement, is. (2) In respect of risk, the former being regarded by the law as an insurer, the latter being liable like or - dinary bailees." Appellee cites Terminal Taxicab Co. v. Eutz, 241 U. S. 252, particularly that part of the opinion m which it was pointed out that a taxicab company had an exclusive contract with a hotel to maintain sufficient taxicabs to be used by the guests of the hotel. The taxicab company claimed it was not a common carrier. The court held the 259 </seg>
            <seg id="p260">THIRTY-FIRST' ANNUAL REPORT- 11 taxicab company to be a common carrier; that the business engaged in by the company, in so far as the hotel was concerned, was of a public nature to such extent that the company would be obligated to haul other persons than guests of the hotel upon demand. This case is cited upon the principle that a carrier may be engaged in hauling one commodity and be a common carrier. Appellee also cites Interstate Commerce, in Ex parte No. MC-12, Motor Carrier Cases, 1 I. C. C. Rep. 628, as follows: "Contract car - nage is a form of private carriage, as distinguished from the carriage for the general public which common carriers hold themselves out to perform. That the business of common carriers is a public calling and subject as such to public regulation has long been recognized. It has become evident, particularly in the motor-carrier field, that private carriage also is sufficiently affected with a public interest to warrant public regulation, at least to an extent. The term 'con - tract carrier' was coined in state statutes for the regulation of motor carriers." The applicant cites Cushing v. White, 172 Pac. 229 (101 Wash. 172) in which the court defined "common carrier" as follows: "A common carrier is one whose occupation is transportation of persons or things from place to place for hire or reward, and who holds him - self out to the world as ready and willing to serve the public in - differently in the particular line or department in which he is engaged - the true test being whether the given undertaking is a part of the business engaged in by the carrier, which he has held out to the general public as his occupation, rather than the quantity or extent of the business actually transacted, or the number and character of the conveyances used in the employment." The opinion gives an exhaustive review of definitions of the term "common carrier". In the case of Georgia Life Ins. Co. v. Easter, 189 Ala. 472 66 i&gt;o. 514, the following definition is given; "The real test whether a man is a common carrier, whether by land or water, therefore, really * whether he has held out that he will, so long as he has room, carry for hire the goods of every person who will bring goods to him to De carried. In Hogan v. Nashville Interurban R. Co., 131 Tenn. 244, 174 S. w. 1118, the court gave the following definition (p 254)- "The true test of the character of a party, as to whether he is a common carrier or not is his legal duty and obligation with reference to transportation Is ,t optional with him whether he will or will not carry; or must he carry for all? If it be his legal duty to carry for all ahke, then he ,s subject to all these stringent rules which, for wise ends, have long since been adopted and uniformly enforced, both in 260 </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION England and all the states, upon common carriers." There are many decisions from the different states of like import. ■ In the case of Dairymen's Cooperative Sales Ass'n. v. Public Ser - vice Commission, 98 A. L. R. 218 (115 Pa. Super. Ct. 100) it was held: "One engaging in the transportation, for members of a.dairy - men's cooperative association, of milk consigned by them to the as - sociation for sale, is not shown to be a common carrier and as such required to obtain a certificate of public convenience, by evidence that he solicited, at the request of the association, certain persons wha were members of the association to sign a hauler's agreement, and that he called on a number of them to ascertain whether the milk would be delivered to him before the hauler's contracts were signed." In Public Utilities Commission vs. Holdren, 34 Ohio App. 416, 171 N. E. 255, it was held: "Truck owners, not holding themselves out as willing to serve the public indiscriminately, but hauling pro - duce of their own and other farms only under private contracts, in - cluding one with a producers' association, which was not shown to be a common carrier and expressly stipulated in contract that no goods should be hauled except as directed by it, held not common carriers." . - Analyzing.. the facts in. the instant xase with .the decisions of the. courts on this proposition of law, we believe that the applicant is, for all intents and purposes, a contract carrier, within the meaning of Legislative Bill No. 178. This brings us to the question of the exemption claimed by the applicant under subdivision (d), sec. 3, Legislative Bill No. 178 (Laws 1937, ch. 142). Said subdivision, in part, follows: "No provision of this Act or order of the Commission shall apply * * * to motor ve - hicles used exclusively in carrying for hire live stock or agricultural - commodities or other commodities used in the production of agri - cultural products to and from any farm or ranch." Appellee relies upon the case of Smith vs. Cahoon, 283 U. S. 553, wherein the court held: "A state statutory provision which re - quires those who operate motor vehicles on the highways in the trans - portation of goods for hire to furnish a bond or insurance policy for the protection of the public against injuries received through negli - gence in such operation, but which does not apply to those engaged exclusively in ■ the transporting agricultural, horticultural, dairy or other farm products and fresh and salt fish and oysters and shrimp from the point of production to the assembling or shipping point en route to primary market, or to motor vehicles used exclusively in transporting or delivering dairy products, held repugnant to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." The opinion re - cognized the principle that the state has a broad discretion and class - ification in the exercise of its power to regulate, . but declared that 261 </seg>
            <seg id="p262">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT the discrimination -was unreasonable and arbitrary. Appellee's con - tention is that the decision in the above case has never been departed from. In the case of Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, 286 U. S. 352, decided May 23, 1932, the court had under consideration the Kansas motor vehicle law of 1931, which imposed a tax on motor vehicles on the basis of gross ton miles. There was an exemption in the statute which applied to the transportation of live stock and farm products to market by the owner thereof or supplies for his use in his motor vehicle Among other things the court held: "The provision in the Kansas Motor Vehicle Act that it shall not apply to the transportation of live stock and farm products to market by the owner thereof or supplies for his own use in his own motor ve - fticle, is likewise based on permissible classification. "The legislature in making its classification was entitled to con - sider frequency and character of use and to adapt its regulations to the classes of operations which by reason of their habitual and con - stant use of the. highways brought about the conditions making regul - ation imperative and created the necessity for the imposition of a tax / f2£f nce and rcconstr «ction." In the opinion it was said (p. 372) : •t, *-" Tb u^ atUte d0CS n0t attem P t to im P°se an arbitary discrim - ination between carriers who transport property for hire, or com - pensation, with respect to the class of products they carry The ex- Tnrf ,? r™ 8 °? ly *° ° ne Wh ° is ear nring his own live stock and farm products to market or supplies for his own use in his own motor vehicle," distinguishing that case from Smith v.

The court in Hicklin v. Coney, supra, said (p. 176): "Upon the present record, it appears that the exemption is applied with two limitations, first, that, as construed by the state court, it can refer only 'to one whose principal business is that of a farmer or dairyman and not to one merely incidentally engaged in farming or dairying', and, second, under the construction of the com - mission in enforcing the statute — a construction not disapproved by the state court — that it applies only to farmers and dairymen who occasionally, and not as regular business, transport farm or dairy products for compensation. We cannot say that a classification based on such a use of the highways is an arbitary one and thus encounters constitutional objection." The last expression by the supreme court of the United States on the subject is found in the case of Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, 295 U. S. 285, decided April 29, 1935. The court held: "A Georgia statute * * * imposing an annual license tax on private carriers by motor vehicle of $'25 per vehicle us - ing the state highways, the proceeds of which tax are applied to the upkeep of state highways, does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by exempting: • * * Vehicles engaged exclusively in the transportation of agricultural or dairy pro - ducts, whether the 'vehicle is owned by the owner or producer of such agricultural or dairy products or not, so long as the title remains in the producer." It was further held: "A state legislature has a wide discretion in the classification of trades and occupations for the purpose of taxation and in the allow - ance of exemptions and deductions within reasonable limits. "Exemption of private carriers of farm and dairy products from a tax, though one imposed for highway upkeep, stands on a different footing from an exemption from a general requirement that private carriers provide bonds to insure the safety of the public on the high - ways." Other cases are cited but we deem the foregoing the pertinent and leading cases on the subject. In the case of Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, supra, appellee contends the court was dealing with an exemption from taxation, which distinguished the situation thus presented from that presented in Smith v. Cahoon, supra, where the ex - emption was from the general regulatory provisions of the act. While the court upheld the exemption, so far as the tax was concerned, it expressed no opinion as to the validity of the exemption regarding regulatory pro - visions. 263 </seg>
            <seg id="p264">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT We see no particular merit in the above distinction, in view of other statutory regulatons in our law governing the operation of motor vehicles over the highways of this state, and to which the applicant is subject. Other cases cited do not disclose whether there are other pertinent provisions of the statutory law that relate to carriers in such cases. The fee designated under Legislative Bill No. 178 is used for administrative purposes, as applied to the instant case. Comp.St. Supp. 1937, sec. 75-226. In the case of Smith v. Cahoon, supra, the car - rier involved was a common carrier and the statute provided for the placing of a bond or insurance policy by the carrier, to provide against negligence of such carrier in operating his vehicle upon the highways of the state. In other cases cited and analyzed, the fee charged to the carrier was used for the construction and maintenance of the highways of the states. Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, supra, in many respects, referring to the facts and the law, is analogous to the case at bar and decisive of the issue as presented in the instant case, with the distinction as heretofore set out. In the instant case, the services of the applicant are not available to the public generally. He does not hold himself ready to serve the public indefinitely. He does not hold himself out to haul any other commodity of any kind or nature, and reserves the right to haul only milk and cream to a designated market, to wit, a dairy and creamery, and to haul the empty cans from the dairy and creamery back to the respective farms. The service which he renders is service done according to private contracts with a group of farmers. No one else is interested and no benefit or disadvantage by reason of the contract, accrues to any one else. He travels over roads which it is impossible for railroads to reach. He renders a service at a minimum cost to the farmers whom he serves. Even though the regulatory fee which he may pay under Legislative Bill No. 178 (Comp St. Supp 1937, sec. 75-226) is apparently small., yet it is well known that if the applicant be forced to pay this fee the ultimate cost will fall on the farmers whom he serves. Taking into consideration the peroid of drouth over the last five or six years, the evident intention of th t legislature in granting this exemption, under the provisions of the sec - tion referred to, was to relieve the farmers of this state of a burden well knowing that commodities, such as milk and cream, constituted during this peroid a farmer's living. It would seem that this exemption is a reasonable and fair exemption, not arbitrary, and, in view of the 2» .""£"% £°f °* , H recDgnize this br °*d Principle of law as to the nght of the legislature to make a reasonable and fair classification, 2tS* *i e ■ gi * e^ We therefore beiieve thatthe a pp» can t « ™- titled to the exemption as contained in subdivision (d), sec 3 ch 142 Laws 1937 (Comp.

            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The railway commission derives jurisdiction over common carriers and the right to regulate such carriers under section 20, art.

The foregoing provisions of the Nebraska statutes are cited, show - ing the delegated powers granted to the railway commission by the legislature of this state and the extension of such powers and duties which have not been challenged in the courts. We have heretofore set out the powers granted to the railway commission, as disclosed by section 20, art. IV of the Constitution of this state. In addition to the con - stitutional and statutory powers delegated to the railway commission, we find expression in the case of in re Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Co., 126 Neb. 138, 253 N. W. 80, as to the extensiveness of the delegated power to the railway commission by the constitutional provision over common carriers (Const, art. IV, sec. 20). The proposition of law announced in the above case is that the plenary power of the railway commission may only be curtailed or diminished where the legislature has, by specific legislation occupied the field. In Stephenson v. Binford, 53 Fed. (2d) 509, the court said (p.515:) "We think that, if a state determines that the business of common carriage by rail and road may no longer, from the standpoint of public interest, be looked upon as a business entirely separate and distinct from that of contract carriers by road, that all of its available carriage services are so bound together and so interdependent that the public may not continue to have a safe and dependable system of transport - ation unless private carriers operating on the same roads with common carriers are brought under just and reasonable regulations, bringing their services into relation with those of common carriers thereon, no just cr valid reason exists why it may not do so." The decision in the above case was subtantially upheld by the supreme court of the United Statos. Stephenson v. Binford, 287 U. S. 251. In section 1 of Legislative Bill No. 178 (Laws 1937, ch. 142) it was "declared to be the policy of the Legislature to regulate transpor - tation by motor carriers in intrastate commerce upon the public high- 265 </seg>

The Legislature declares that all of the available carriage service, including common carriage by rail and road and contract car - riage by road, are so interdependent that the public may not continue to have a safe and dependable transportation system unless contract carriers operating on the same roads with common carriers are brought under just and reasonable regulations bringing their service into relation with common carriers." The section above quoted meets exactly the proposition of law as laid down m Stephenson v. Binford, supra, and uses the exact lang - uage, m part, as stated m the opinion m that case.

OPINION AND FINDINGS GOOD, Commissioner: Complaints were filed with the Commission regarding the livestock rates prescribed at pp. 59, 60 and 61 of the Common Carrier Truck Rates, Classification, Rules and Regulations, Resolution No. 146, ef - fective February 14, 1938. Upon consideration of such complaints the Commission issued its findings and order, Supplement No. 'lo, to Resolution No. 146, which cancelled the livestock rates, prescribed the voluntary livestock rates m effect February 13, 1938 as lawful rates for transportation of said commodity until the further order of the Commission and further provided that hearings be held 'to determine and prescribe a schedule of reasonable rates for such transportation. Supplement No. 10 to Resolution No. 146 became effective February 26, 1938. Following the issuance of this supplement, cancelling the fates originally prescribed, J. A. Little, Chief Expert for the Commission joined Mr. E. P. Ryan of Grand Island who represented the Interior Auction Markets and Nebraska Motor Carriers Association, m making a survey of condition existing at typical interior auction markets as they affected the transportation of livestock. The preliminary discussions related to livestock rates into and out of such markets, the livestock rates from the surrounding areas into the terminal markets, such as Omaha and the special problems of transportation, if any, existing m the area adjacent to such markets. . ;i Formal hearings were began at McCook, March 14, 1938. Sub - sequent hearings were held at North Platte, Broken Bow, Grand Island, Norfolk and Lincoln. At the conclusion of the first series of hearings at Lincoln an adjournment was taken to permit one important group of truckers and the Omaha. Livestock Exchange to complete the prepar - ation of their evidence. Briefs were filed on behalf of the Interior Auction Markets Asso - ciation and Nebraska Motor Carriers Association jointly and by the Cen - tral States Motor Carriers Association and Omaha Livestock Exchange. Following the hearings and submission of briefs the Com - mission brought a considerable group of shippers, market representa - tives and truckers, including representatives of county and state truck - ers associations, together for the purpose of discussing the issue inform - ally with a view to reaching an agreement; if possible. While, the con- 269 </seg>
            <seg id="p270">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT ference was helpful it did not produce agreement as to the rates and charges to be prescribed. The record m this proceeding is large. Shippers and producers of livestock as well as truckers and market representatives have all sub - mitted evidence showing the effect of the rates originally prescribed and making suggestions as to future rates, rules and regulations de - signed to facilitate the production and marketing of our livestock. The Commission appreciates the spirit of co-operation which all have shown throughout this investigation. We shall first discuss certain matters concerning which there is little or no controversy. SHIPPING PAPERS The Rules and Regulations of the Common Carrier Truck Tariff provide that receipts for all shipments received by common carriers shall be made on the prescribed Uniform Bill of Lading and that a paid freight bill shall be issued when freight charges are collected on delivery of such shipments at their destination. A large share of all thp livestock transported by motor vehicle carriers is delivered at public livestock markets located at various interior cities such as McCook, North Platte, Broken Bow. Grand Island, Norfolk and York and at Omaha terminal, slaughtering market. To prevent "rustling" of livestock using trucks to effect n quick getaway, the Legislature enacted Chapter 60-701, C. S. 'Sup. 1933 which requires the shipper of livestock and the trucker who receives it, to sign a Permit to ship Livestock using forms approved by this Commission. It is unlawful for any truck operator to transport livestock, which he does not own, between any two points m this state unless he has m his possession a duly signed Permit to Ship Livestock. Truckers are required to show such permits to peace officers and are subject to fine or imprisonment for failure to obey this law. These Permits to Ship Livestock carry all the information essential to th« Uniform Bill of lading including a space for the rate charged. In view of these facts we conclude that the execution of a Uniform Bill of Lading should no longer be required as to livestock shipments because the Permit to Ship Livestock must be used to comply with with Nebraska Statutes and it satisfies the same general purposes. When livestock is received at either Omaha or the interior auction markets the stock is sold and the proceeds of the sale arc remitted to the shipper after deducting freight charges, insurance, commissions, etc. The weight of the livestock is not usually known when the stock is unloaded. It would therefore be difficult, if not impossible, for truckers to submit a freight bill covering the livestock which they deliver at the markets. The Permit to Ship Livestock shows the rate to be charged. When the weight of the stock is ascertained the seller can readily compute the 270 </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION freight charges due and deduct them from the account of sales. The charges paid by any shipper or collected by any carrier for transport - ation of livestock can be readily checked m the records of these public markets. There is, therefore, no reason why the uniform freight bill pre - scribed for general uso of common earner truck operators should be made to cover such livestock sold at public markets. We shall authorize the settlement of all freight charges on livestock, consigned to public markets, by the deduction of freight charges from the Account of Sales. This arrangement is approved by the truckers and markets generally. However, the regular freight bill must be used to acknowledge receipt of freight paid for transportation of all livestock not consigned to a public livestock market. MINIMUM WEIGHTS The amount of livestock which can be loaded m a truck depends on the size of the vehicle and the kind of livestock involved. It is true that trailers used by some truckor can easily carry loads of livestock exceeding 10,000 pounds but the bulk of the trucks engaged m trans - porting livestock are comparatively s-mall straight trucks capable of handling from 5,000 to 9,000 pounds of stock. In view of these facts and considering thn testimony of both shippers and truckers we conclude that the minimum truckload should be set at 5,000 pounds. If conditions favor the use of trailers of large capacity the trucker may find that heavier loads enable him to earn somewhat greater net revenues from the transportation of livestock. However it should be understood that the livestock rates have not been set on a high level because of the 5,000 pound minimum weight prescribed. A considerable volume of cattle are shipped from ranches m the sand hills to auction markets at interior points and to Omaha. The evidence shows that the transportation of livestock out of the sand hills is attended by greater costs and operating hazards than those sur - rounding transportation of similar shipments for equal distances from points of production m the South Platte area or m Eastern Nebraska. The difficulties of operation vary with the length of haul and differences m the topography of the particular areas from, which livestock is ship - ped. It is therefore impossible to prescribe a hard and fast rule for gcnrral application to livestock shipments from the sandh : .lls. We there - fore provide that livestock rates from sand hills locations shall never be lower than the standard livestock rates prescribed but that the shipper and trucker may agree upon such additional compensation as the conditions seem to justify to compensate the trucker for the extra hazard and expense involved. There was much confusion as to the application of the 5 cent "Pick- Up" charge provided m the original tariff. We understand that, m cases where one shipper does not offer a full truck load for transportation, the truck operator arranges to "pick up" a load at two or more different 271 </seg>
            <seg id="p272">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT locations. To compensate for the extra time, labor and mileage driven when shipments are picked up at more than one location, to accumulate a truck load, it has long been the custom of Nebraska truckers to charge 5 cents per cwt. additional above the full truck load rates otherwise applicable. On the evidence we conclude that this 6 cent pick up charge is reasonable and should be continued in effect. The suspended livestock rates provided for a basic cattle rate and separate scale of rates applicable to hogs, horses and mules and to sheep. We have carefully considered the testimony on this subject and believe that all livestock except sheep and goats should take the same basic rates and that the rates applicable to sheep and goats ought to be 2 cents higher than such basic livestock rates. We turn now to the question of the rates to be prescribed. It was quita generally conceded by the parties that some short haul rates or charges were too high and that some long haul rates were too low as fixed in the Common Carrier Truck Rates tariff of February 14, 1938. However, it is likely that no two parties of record will entirely agree as to which short haul rates are to high and which long rates are •too low. Certain carriers and shippers objected to the gradation in the rates because of the existence of blankets covering distances as great as 20 or 25 miles of origin territory. The principal complaint as to the short haul rates comes from the interior auction markets and shippers who patronize them. The prin - cipal complaint as to short haul rates involved charges on one or a few head of horses, cows, steers or hogs in connection with which first class rates or minimum truck load charges based on a 5,000 pound minimum seem to have been almost prohibitive. It is pointed out that high short haul rates will encourage the use of small farm trailers or farm trucks to the detriment of common carrier livestock haulers. Truck operators who testified agreed that a reduced basis of rates should be provided for small local shipments consigned to the auction markets. We approve this proposal and shall deal with the subject further hereafter. The most important movement of livestock by truck involves ship - ments consigned to Omaha. The fixing of reasonable and just basis of livestock rates for truck transportation is complicated by competition of the trucks with the railroads and among themselves. Below we have inserted a table comparing the Commission made rates of February 14th on cattle and hogs to Omaha for various hauls with the average truck rates to Omaha and with the average present railroad rates from the same points and the average hog rates which would apply from the same origin points on the I. C. C. Docket 17000, Part 9 scale which wai approved by us for application by Nebraska railroads. 272 </seg>
            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The I. C. C. Docket 17000, Part 9 rates were first prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Livestock Western District Rates 176 ICC I. That proceeding involved both the state and interstate rates on livestock moving in carload lots by railroad between all points in the United States lying west of Chicago and the Mississippi River. The investigation was thorough. More than 15,000 pages of testimony and 5,000 pages of exhibits were received. The case was under consideration for several years. Soon after the decision wa3 made by the Interstate Commerce Commission various state railroad commissions, including the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission, approved the same rates for state application. The table below compares the original livestock rates for truck hauling, ef - fective February 14, 1938 with the average of the railroad rates and actual truck rates charged before February 14th, from same point to Omaha. For example the 25 mile truck tariff rates applied from several different statio: s to Omaha The average truck rates are "an average of the actual truck rates charged from the same points to Omaha before February 14th. The average rail rates are the average of the railroad rates from the same station to Omaha. Incidentally it should be understood that truck waybills and account sales covering 1089 con - signments of livestock were examined to secure data as to the truck rates charged. The exhibit showing this data reflects wide variations in the rates charged amounting to as much as 100 per cent in a few cases. 273 </seg>

The long haul rates are on a basis which we believe is more properly related to the short haul rate levels. The earnings per truck load and per truck mile at the approved rate basis are certainly not too high, as the comparison below indicates. 277 </seg>

A comparison of the rates prescribed will show that new rates are close to the average actual truck rates charged. They are higher than railroad carload rates by varying amounts depending on the level of the rail rates which are on a "truck-compelled" basis m some sections of the state and on the full Docket 17,000 Part 9 basis m connection with the long and middle distance hauls. This is not true of short hauls for distance of 40 miles or less. These short haul rates are lower than the rail rates. The prescription of short haul rates and more especially rates to apply on les3 than truck-load shipments which move to the interior auction markets is the most difficult single problem confronting the Commission m this proceeding. Interested shippers and truckers pro - posed several different methods of solving this problem. It is obvious that charges can be reduced by either reducing the minimum weights or Teducing the rates per hundred pounds or by reducing both factors. The different proposals submitted are shown below for hauls of 5 to 30 miles inclusive. 278 </seg>

            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Throughout the hearings and m the preparation of this opinion we have dealt with motor vehicle common carriers who are principally engaged m the transportation of livestock from the -farms or ranches of this state to or from the public markets located at various interior cities and at Omaha.

There are no contract carriers of livestock, insofar as we are able to discover, who may or do come within the terms of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska m Ralph C. Rodgers, appellant vs. Nebraska State Railway Commission, appellee, decided May 27, 1938. Truckers organizations and various individual truck operators have repeatedly asked the Commission to expedite the decision of this case and establish a new basis of livestock rates. It is claimed that a chaotid condition exists and that no improvement can be expected until the Commission makes its decision. We therefore conclude that an emer - gency exists which justifies the establishment of the new rates effect - ive June 15, 1938. On careful consideration of the facts of record, the Commission being fully advised m the premises, we are of the opinion and so find : That Supplement No. 10 to Resolution No. 146 should be and it is hereby cancelled. That all rates on livestock as provided on pp. 59, 60 and 61 of the Official Common Carrier Truck Rates, Classification, Rules and Regu - lations of February 14, 1938 should be cancelled and m lieu thereof the rates, rules and regulations set forth below should be prescribed as just and reasonable rates, rules and regulations for future application, effective June 15, 1938. 281 </seg>

Should we prescribe rates for one without the power to prescribe rates for the other? Or should we leave the regulated carrier free to meet the competition of the unregulated carrier m his own way? I fear that the result will be chaos and that the regulated carrier will be ulti - mately driven out of business on short hauls and where no return load to local merchants is possible. I know no way to avoid this result unless my colleagues hold that horses, cattle, hogs and sheep are not livestock and that the livestock exemption has no application. It has been suggested that this exemption contravenes the power vested m us by the Constitution to regulate rates of common carriers.

            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION common carrier truckers and we are of the opinion that this practice does not promote adequate, economical and efficient service by motor carriers and reasonable Y-harges therefor and constitutes unjust discrimination, undue preferences or advantages and unfair or destructive competitive practices, all of which appears to us to be m violation of the policy and purpose of the Legislature m the enactment of Chapter 142 of the 1937 Session Laws, (L.

            <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Pursuant to said order, the matter came on for hearing before all Commissioners m Legislative Hall at the Capital. The respondents, by their evidence, divide themselves into three classes, first, those who transport their own merchandise or products by the use of their own motor vehicles and sell the same at the same price at point of destin - ation as at point of origin; second, those who transport their own merchandise and products and soil the same at a delivered price m excess of the price at the point of origin and, third, those who transport their own merchandise and products and add to the invoice a specific charge for transportation. On the part of the respondents, it was contended that conditions exist which require them to meet a competitive situation. Jobbers, wholesalers and manufacturers m surrounding states were us - ing itheir own motor vehicles for the transportation of their merchandise and products. As private carriers, the Interstate Commerce Commission has not assumed jurisdiction to regulate them, and if it should assume such jurisdiction under the Federal Act, it is doubtful if it has power to regulate tlieir rates. If they are served by common carriers subject to the Federal Act, such common carriers are only required to file their rates and such rates are lawful rates unless suspended or modified. No immediate relief can be expected from the Federal Commission. The respondents contend that if they are required to apply common carrier rates, fixed by this Commission, they will be unable to compete with their out-state competitors. The respondents also contend that there exists at many points m 'the state competitive conditions arising from other causes which require them to meet that competition by using their own motor vehicles. At the close of the hearing we requested respondents to file written briefs and' many briefs were filed and we have friven the briefs very careful study and consideration. The com - plninants who had been so insistent and persistent m demanding that the Commission assume jurisdiction over the respondents did not appear m great numbers or if they appeared they kept silent. With but one or two exceptions, they did not offer to testify. They did not file written briefs m support of the proposed order. We will give separate treatment to each of the three classes of respondents. The first class who transport their own merchandise' and Droducts with their own motor vehicles and sell for the same price at point of destination as at the point of origin, needs but slight, if any treatment. The case of Murphy vs. Standard Oil Company of Indiana, 49 S.D. 197, 207 N.W. 92, is squarely m point. Murphy delivered his own merchandise by motor vehicle at the same price at destination ns nt point of origin. In that case, the South Dakota court used the following language: "In order to support the conclusion that defendant is a carrier for hire, there must be evidence showing that de - fendant is equipped for carrying persons or property, and that it is entrajred m carryincr or offers to carry persons or property other than itself or its own property for a comptn- 293 </seg>
            <seg id="p294">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT eation in some form. The phrase 'carry for hire' necessarily implies a contractual relation between the two parties, and the Legislature cannot, by mere legislative fiat, make a party a carrier for hire who never carries or offers to carry anything but himself or his own property any more than it can make black white or white black. A person cannot hire himself nor pay himself." The foregoing language is conclusive as to the first class of re - spondents and applies directly to all of the respondents. We will confine our discussion to the second and third classes who make a transportation charge, either by differential between the delivered price and the price at the point of origin, or by adding a specific transportation charge to the invoice, and in our judgment a distinction without any substantial difference. Both classes make a charge for transportation. In one class the charge is concealed in the delivered price. In the other class it is revealed on the invoice and when added to the invoice the sum amounts to a delivered price. The question presented for determination is whether the foregoing operations constitute the transportation of property by motor carriers for hire. In the case of Rodgers vs. Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion, recently decided by the Supreme Court, it was held that Rodgers. who transported milk from all farmers on his route who sold the same to certain Lincoln processors and distributors, was not a common carrier. The respondents in the instant case hold themselves out to transport property for all -who purcha.-.e merchandise from them. Otherwise, they do not hold themselves out to carry for the general public. Following the definition laid down by the Supreme Court in the Rodgers case, we are of the opinion that the respondents are contract carriers, and, as such, are not subject to regulation by the Commission under the power? vested in us by the Constitution. Our jurisdiction over them, if any, must necessarily arise under Chapter 142 of 1937 Session Laws, (L. B. 178). We will first determine, if possible, the intention of the Legislature as the same is reflected in the language used in the act. By Section 3 of the act it is provided : "The provisions of this act shall apply to the transpor - tation of passengers or property by motor carriers for hire engaged in intrastate commerce except*** (d)** No provision of this act or order of the Commission shall apply to motor vehicles owned and operated by farmers, ranchers, dairymen, or a creamery or their employees when hauling ranch, dairy or farm products and supplies from and to their ranches farms dames or creamery, * * • nor shall any provision apply to motor vehicles owned and operated by any industrial, pro - cessing or manufacturing plant when used by such plant in the transportation of raw materials and supplies to its plant </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION or plants or m the delivery of its products, supplies or raw materials to purchasers thereof when not for hire." It manifestly appears that it was the clear intention of the Legislature to exempt motor vehicles owned and operated by farmers, ranchers, dairymen, and creameries when transporting their own property. It further appears that it was the clear intention of the Legislature to ex - empt motor vehicles owned and operated by industrial processing and manufacturing 1 plants when transporting their own merchandise. The phrase, "when not for hire" can apply only to those who transport the property of others. The same Legislature that enacted the 193 V Motor Carriers Act also enacted Chapter 168 of the 1937 Session Laws (L. B. 50) to regulate itinerant merchants whose only source of rev - enue arises from the difference paid for property at the point of origin and the sale price at the point of destination, and vested the adminis - tration and enforcement of same with the Department of Agriculture. It would therefore appear that the Legislature did not intend for this Commission to regulate this class of motor carriers who transport their own merchandise. Tf the Legislature had intended that this Com - mission should regulate the respondent carriers who carry their own property, wfe are of the opinion that it would have said so m clear, certain and affirmative language. In Application No. M-5403 of Edgar N. Davis, funeral director and undertaker of Cozad, Nebraska, for. authority to operate as a motor carrier of property for hire, decided by us on February 4th, 1938, we dismissed tl^e same with the following finding: '"that where transportation by motor vehicles is inci - dental to and a necessary part of an otherwise purely private business and no separate charge is made for such transporta- • tion but such charge is included m a general charge for labor and materials, that such an operation is not subject to the provisions of Chapter 142 of the 1937 Session Laws, (L. B 178).- 1 ' In the present case, the motor carriers now under consideration are en - paged m a purely private business. They are m the business of selling and distributing merchandise at wholesale. They tranport their own merchandise m their own motor vehicles as an incident to a purely pri - vate business. The courts of other states have construed the term "carry for hire" to mean one who carries for other 3 and one who carries for himself is not a carrier for hire. Murphy v.

A.L.R. 1145 103 A.L.R. 268 We are constrained to hold that the Legislature intended the term "motor carriers for hire" m Section 3 of the Act to include only those who carried the property of others and did not intend it to include those who carried their own property m their own motor vehicles as a mere incident to their business. The Courts of other states as reflected m the foregoing cases have construed the term to mean exactly what the Legislature intended. Having reached the conclusion that we are without jurisdiction m the premises it would be academic to discuss the wisdom of exercising it- If our jurisdiction is doubtful, the injury that might result m exercising it as disclosed by the record would be greater than any benefits hoped for. The remedy, if any, for the existing condition should come from the Legislature and not by the usurpation of powers not vested m this Commission. We therefore are of the opinion and so find that Resolution No. 149 and our order to show cause entered thereunder should be dis - missed. An appropriate order will be entered. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that Resolution No. 149 and the order to show cause enter - ed thereunder, be and the same is hereby dismissed. MADE AND ENTERED at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 20th day of Juno, 1938* (SEAL) NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION (Signed) F. L. BOLLEN Chairman. ATTEST: (Signed) George E. Truman Secretary. COMMISSIONER CONCURRING: (signed) F. L. BOLLEN (signed) F. A. GOOD (signed) WILL M. MAUPIN 296 </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION COMMISSIONS GOOD, CONCURRING: I concur m the conclusion reached by Commissioner Bollen's opinion. Recognizing the validity of certain findings m the opinion of Commissioner Bollen, together with the apparent fact that very few jobbers, processors or manufacturers have essayed to attempt an in - creased delivery of their sundry outputs by their own motor vehicles I am constrained to concur m this order, but this without prejudice against future consideration as to the merits of the case. I am appreciative that constructive legislation is sometimes ren - dered innocuous, or ruined entirely, by liberal exemptions. If whole - salers, processors and manufacturers are exempted, and as a result many ', such, put on their own out-state delivery system without any obligation to prove convenience and necessity, there could be little doubt that such operation would be disastrous to such common carriers as were re - quired to obtain certificates upon proof of convenience and necessity. Every corporation operating m Nebraska must file with the Secretary of State its article of incorporation. We doubt if any whole - salers, brokers, processors or manufacturers are authorized, under such articles, to engage m the transportation business — even if the goods transported might be their own. We are mindful that the U. S. Supreme Court decided, under a federal statute, that the identical corporation or company could not own coal mines and transport their own output to consignees other than to themselves, i. c., the railroad. Chairman Bollen hn^ cited the decision of the Supreme Court m the R dgers milk haulers case wherein the court appears to have labelled a carrier who accepted milk from anyone tendering it sub - ject only to his ability to handle the same — as a contract carrier. The chairman, by circumlocution now labels wholesalers, processors and manufacturers as contract carriers. These are new and unique hold - ings, doing viblence to universally accepted definitions of what con - stitutes a contract carrier. Such transporters are at one and the same time private and contract carriers — contracting with themselves. However, as there appears no immediate necessity for the issuance of an order compelling private carriers to take out Railway Commis - sion certificates or permits and to then conform to the rates and regu - lations incident to such procedure, I hereby concur m the order, espe - cially as the assumption of such jurisdiction would seem inexpedient at the present time. (signed) F. A. GOOD, Commissioner. 297 </seg>
            <seg id="p298">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER MAUPIN, CONCURRING IN ORDER BUT NOT IN CONCLUSIONS AT WHICH ARRIVED: While concurring m the order prepared by Chairman Bollen, I dis - agree wholly from the conclusions whereby he reaches his order. I am of the opinion that any wholesaler, manufacturer or processor who transports his products from his place of business, and m so doing adds, no matter under what guise or form, a carrying charge, or charge great - er for the commodity at point of destination than at the place of origin, is clearly carrying for hire. An order placed with a wholesaler means, to my mind, that when the order is accepted and bill of lading made out, and bill prepared, that the goods are no longer the property of the con - signor, but is the property of the consignee, and m carrying said pro - perty for the consignee the consignor is carrying for hire when he charges more for the goods delivered at destination than he charges for the goods at the point of origin. But due to the fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission has been woefully lax m performing its duty to formulate interstate truck - ing rates, the enforcement of jurisdiction over Nebraska interstate rates would throw an undue burden upon Nebraska wholesalers, manufactur - ers and processors, I deem it unwise at this time to undertake such jurisdiction, preferring to. await the time, if ever, when the Interstate Commerce Commission realizes the injury to industry of its uncalled - for delay m formulating interstate rates for motor transportaton. Dissenting as I do from the argument and conclusions of the dis - tinguished chairman of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, I am forced to join m the order he has prepared purely as a defense of our Nebraska industries.
