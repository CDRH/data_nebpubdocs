            <seg id="p004">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 247 To His Excellency, Honorable John H. Morehead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Com - missioners of State Institutions, Silas A. Holcomb, Howard Kennedy and Henry Gerdes. Gentlemen : I am presenting herewith the institution's twenty-sec - ond biennial report. This report embraces the period ex - tending from December 1, 1912, to July 1, 1913, a period in which the Board of Public Lands and Buildings were in charge of the institution, and from the date of July 1, 1913, to December 1, 1913, and December 1, 1913, to December 1, 1914, during which period the institution was under the control of the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions. In other words the first year of the biennium is divided, so that the whole biennium is sub-divided into three periods. The financial report is carried to the date of July 1, 1913, and not beyond. During the biennium. we have received 741 patients. Of those admitted 314 men and 13 women were admitted under the dipsomaniac law ; the balance were admitted as insane. Table IX given below will indicate the form of mental trouble for which patients were admitted. A total of 1351 patients have been under treatment during the biennium. CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS Alcoholic Psychosis The diagnosis of alcoholic psychosis based upon find - ings unquestionably due to alcohol and not upon alleged causes reported in commitment papers amounts to 13 cases, or 3.26% of total admissions. This group does not neces - sarily include all cases in which alcohol is a factor. Cases encountered and classified under a different group are doubtless influenced by excessive use of alcohol. In other </seg>
            <seg id="p005">248 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF words, where a tendency to mental overthrow exists, the use of alcohol may induce the outbreak and yet not be charged with the production of the psychosis in that the case falls under the heading of those cases considered functional in character and influenced by heredity. There - fore this group does not stand as an index to the influence of alcohol in mental disease. The alcoholic psychoses are largely recoverable cases with the possible chance of return - ing to their dipsomania or suffering a second attack of psychosis. Manic Depressive Insanity During the past two years 12.54' f , or 50 cases ad - mitted to the institution were cases of manic depressive in - sanity. Of these 21 were males and 29 were females. Where a history could be obtained it was evident that heredity was a strong factor in this form of mental aliena - tion. Given a careful personal history and an accurate family history there is usually little difficulty in diagnosing cases of this group. Occasionally katatonic excitement en - countered in praecox cases may be mistaken for the man - iacal stage of this form of psychosis and a pre-senile in - volutional melancholia mistaken for the depressed phase of maniacal depressive insanity. However, prolonged ob - servation usually clears the diagnosis. These cases have insight, show no mental deterioration and are recoverable, but are prone to recurrence under stress. During the year four patients not having passed the child-bearing period and having been restored mentally, having full insight sought protection by requesting that they be sterilized before being released from the hospital. In one of the cases sufficient pathology existed to justify the procedure ; the woman was, therefore, operated at the hospital. In the remaining three cases, the hospital, not being legally justified, was forced to refuse. However, upon being released from the hospital the home surgeons in each instance received and sterilized the patient with uniformly good results mentally and physically. This in - cidentally emphasizes the importance of some legislation which will enable the proper authorities to render the </seg>

            <seg id="p007">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 249 relief sought by cases of this type who have sufficient in sight to choose. Dementia Praecox This interesting group of mental cases is oft times crowded with those who defy analysis and are thus placed for want of other classification. In our method of classi - fying we have sought to avoid this, frankly grouping as unclassified or as paranoid cases any who do not come within the rather liberal domain of dementia praecox. There have been admitted in all 123 cases of dementia praecox, or 30.84'r of all admissions of which 44 cases were male and 79 cases were female ; 43 were hebephrenic, 35 katatonic and 45 paranoid. Of the cases of dementia praecox the katatonic type has shown the greatest ten - dency to restoration. The hydrotherapy rooms have proven of immense value in ministering to this group. The art room where the individual is taught some simple vocation has proven of great value in the development of the vol - untary attentive control. During the period a series of 14 casesof dementia praecox were treated with Lungall's solution and a smaller series by the Nucleinate of Soda. Of the series so treated practically all have shown physical improvement. Some have shown mental improvement coupled with physical improvement, others have shown no mental improvement and still others have continued to de - teriorate mentally. Of the varied methods of treatment hydrotherapy, arts, crafts, occupational pursuits and medicinal treatment, each has contributed its full measure of benefit. This group is composed of 65 cases of which 62 are male and 3 are female. 16.26 r /r of the total of admissions for the biennial period were cases of paresis. Since the establishment of the connection between paresis and syphilis medical efforts in the treatment of paresis have been di - rected along anti-syphilitic lines. With this thought in mind we have administered during the biennium 62 intra- Dementia Paralytica </seg>
            <seg id="p008">250 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF spinous treatments, in 11 cases using salvarsanized blood serum. The treatment seems to have retarded the pro - gress of the disease in some cases. The results, however, are far from gratifying and paresis continues to be an irrecoverable disease, the course of which is quite variable and subject to remission. This fact in itself renders hasty observation and observation gleaned from a small series of ca'ses utterly valueless. The use of salvarsan intraven - ously has given little definite results. Dementia paralytica is unquestionably among the preventable diseases and, in that we are powerless to save the individual so afflicted, our efforts toward prophylaxis should be ever vigorous. A cam - paign of education would do much to minimize the number. Paranoid Group In this group we have placed those cases which have definite paranoid ideas and which for reason of lack of evi - dence of mental deterioration are not placed in the praecox group. The paranoid group cannot be considered a diag - nosis, but simply a group into which we may place certain types of mental trouble which for obvious reasons are not easily classified other places. It is also true that other forms of mental trouble placed in this group at time of admission to the hospital, as the case is observed and the trouble advances, are transferred to their proper classi - fication. Senile Dementia Senile dementia constitutes our fourth largest group of mental disorders. The large number of senile patients received greatly increased our mortality rate and decreased materially the gross restorations. We were not able to secure sufficient history to determine the influence of heredity in those cases admitted to the hospital. Neither were we able to secure data as to the influence of alcohol and drugs. It is, however, probable that no definite proof can be obtained to indicate any connection between the dementia resulting from vascular disturbance in the age'] and early personal history. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 251 Developmental Defects 25 or 6.27 f r of our admissions as insane were of de - fective mental development. Among this group we re - ceived one brother and sister each of the imbecile class. The family history in these two cases, as revealed by the physician's returns, states that the mother's sister and brother were tuberculous, one brother of the immediate family was tuberculous, one other member of the family is defective, and one brother of the mother was epileptic. It is unfortunate that we are not legally permitted to steril - ize such an individual and thereby justify the discharge from the institution of a certain number of defectives who under the usual custodial care of the home "with relatives" might be profitably employed outside the institution. How - ever, the presence of sexual excitement with little inhibit - ing control is so constant in this group that the hazard of releasing those even though able to pursue a definite course of employment is too great to justify the release. Involutional Melancholia Eight of our admissions were of this type. This group like the senile dementias are the product of vascular changes, but as a type does not conform to the dementias. Prolonged duration with intense depression and agitation justifies the continuation of this clinical group, or its intro - duction into the manic depressive group as a sub-specie of that well recognized type. Epileptic Insanity 24, or 6.11 r f of our admissions were epileptics. There are in the institution today a total of 48 epileptics. Of these patients the larger percentage would be more com - fortably cared for on a farm colony where outdoor tasks under appropriate custodial care would result in physical and mental profit to the individual as well as greater profit to the state. We have followed the practice of employing as many of these cases in outside employment as expedient. However, on the farm colony plan a greater number could be so employed, in that the group would be segregated and not mingled with the insane. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">252 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF Psychoneurosei and Psychopathic Personalities In these two groups we have received seven patients, four of whom were classified as psychopathic personalities. Individuals constitutionally psychopathic, introspective and self -centered to the degree that they fail to harmonize with the business and social world, the institution provides these individuals with protection and affords more pleasant ex - periences than those encountered in the outside world. Dipsomania Results from treatment of dipsomania are hard to de - termine. Many of the patients released after treatment are lost to the institution, no reports available by reason of change of residence or neglect. The dipsomaniac law of Nebraska was founded upon the presumption that ad - dicts to drug or alcohol responded to medical treatment alone. Many other states have attempted the same method of solving the dipsomaniac problem, but each in turn with the single exception of Nebraska have discontinued the plan of committing these patients to a hospital for the insane and have established farm colonies under medical supervision where those who have lost the art of self - sustaining endeavor through constant use of drugs or al - cohol, together with those who, though industrious, havins? become so enslaved to the habit, are physically unfit for labor, may be segregated ; and a prolonged custodial super - vision applied whereby he may receive attention, morally, mentally and physically ; where habits of shiftlessness may be replaced by habits of industry ; where the physical body may be improved and the mental attitude completely changed ; that the whole problem of life may appeal to him from an entirely different view-point. This result can be accomplished only under the plan of prolonged custodial care and much personal effort directed to the end that this citizen may become self-sustaining, industrious and sober, with a normal appreciation for home and country, and proper respect for self and family. Such a plan will yield results commensurate to the expense. The state of Minne - sota is possibly the last to establish a farm colony, the </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 253 plan of which is especially attractive and the result equally inspiring. Concerning the treatment of drug habitues we have received during the period eight women and forty-two men, a number of whom used morphine, a small percentage using cocaine and a few using both, with a still smaller number using any narcotic drug obtainable. We have employed as a routine the Towns-Lambert method of treatment, consist - ing in a word of substituting a combination of narcotic drugs accompanied with most thorough eliminative treat - ment. We can report most satisfactory results from this method of treatment. However, it is to be borne in mind that the treatment is hazardous in the hands of the in - experienced or those slow to properly interpret the physical signs as the case progresses. Little data is obtainable as to the cause of their addiction. Many patients to shield themselves throw the blame for their addiction upon phy - sicians who have prescribed morphine to relieve pain. How - ever, after careful inquiry we feel warranted in stating without definite figures to support the claim, that a very small percentage of the cases received are actually charge - able to physicians' prescriptions. The vast bulk are the result of association with those addicted to the drug. The tables presented covering admissions of dipso - maniacs and movement of population of this class are as nearly complete as possible for us to obtain. Our experience in dealing with return cases teaches us that a more rigid enforcement of our present law gov - erning the dispensing of narcotic drugs, save on physicians' prescriptions, or the substituting of a law establishing a dispenser under bond would aid materially in controlling the dope evil. That the drug is obtained on the market with far too little difficulty is an accepted fact which richly deserves careful consideration at the hands, of our legis - lators. MEDICAL STAFF Dr. Clarence Emerson, who served the hospital since the close of the year 1911, resigned his position June 15, 1914, and is now engaged in private practice in the city </seg>
            <seg id="p012">254 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF of Lincoln. He is, however, giving special attention to pathology in his practice and is assisting in the pathological work at the hospital at the present time. Dr. Griffiths, who succeeded Dr. Emerson, is doing service as pathologist and as physician, having charge of six wards. The following publications on medical subjects have been issued in reprint by different members of the staff during the year. The papers have been read before med - ical meetings. "Transient Symptoms in Early Paresis," read before the Chicago meeting of Alienists and Neurolo - gists; "Modern Conception of Psychiatry," read before the Elkhorn Valley Medical Society ; "Modern Methods in Treatment in Mental Cases," Gage County Medical Society ; and "The Insanity of Adolescence," Lancaster County Med - ical Society, by Dr. B. F. Williams; "Paresis Patients Treated With Intraspinal Injections by Salvarsanized Serum," read before the American Medical Association at Atlantic City; "General Paresis," Nebraska State Medical Society, and "Gross Brain Lesions," Lancaster County Med - ical Society, by Dr. L. B. Pilsbury; "Glycosuria in the In - sane," "An Electric Incubator at a Small Cost," "An In - strument for Intraspinal Injections," and "Phthalein Kid - ney Test in the Insane," Lancaster County Medical Society, by Dr. Clarence Emerson. The members of the staff have manifested a keen in - terest in their work ; efforts directed to the restoration of patients through modern treatment have been quite vigor - ous. The hydrotherapeutic rooms have afforded great re - lief to indicated cases and have proven a very valuable ad - junct to the other method of treatment. TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES In that the results obtained in treatment and care of the diseased mind are in direct proportion to the faithful and diligent effort put forth by the nurse attendant in charge of the patient, it is highly important that a high standard of efficiency be maintained. With this object in view a training school for nurses is conducted. There are employed at the hospital 46 nurses and nurse attendants, 36 are in training; 23 are members of the junior class, 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p013">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 255 are members of the senior class; and 10 are graduated nurses, having completed their training. The privilege of training has been extended to the male side of the house and while not required the male nurse attendants are strongly urged to register for training. The course of in - struction consists of eight hours to didactic lectures a week regularly with an occasional extra lecture together with bedside nursing, operating room technique, medical and surgical emergencies, hydrotherapy and dietetics, all of which are taught by practical demonstrations. The course of study is as follows: Fint Year FIRST SEMESTER— September 20 to January 20 No. of No. of Hrs.

            <seg id="p014">■&gt; 256 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF HOUSING That we may have a proper appreciation of the normal housing capacity of the institution at the present time I submit the following data. The building known as male ward 6 building by reason of its age having become unsafe was condemned and ordered vacated. Forty-one male pa - tients employed in our departments occupied the upper story of this building as an open ward. On the first floor were housed twelve employees and the patients' sewing room. In vacating this building we were compelled to use the ward formerly used for infirm old women as an open ward for men, housing the old ladies chiefly on B — 1, where it was found necessary to open a dining room as the old ladies were physically unable to climb the stairs to the general dining room. On the male side of the house there are at the pres - ent time 188 single beds, 83 three-quarter beds, there are 102 patients sleeping two patients to a three-quarter bed, eight of whom are on our acute disturbed ward, and 22 on our semi-violent ward. Our capacity, therefore, in the male wards, counting one patient to a bed and one bed to a side-room is 271 patients. We would require 51 additional beds on the male side of the house to provide housing facil - ities for our present population. On the female side of the house we have 319 single beds, 53 three-quarter beds and 34 patients sleeping two in a bed and six sleeping on the floor on our acute disturbed ward and each bed filled in our semi - violent ward. We would, therefore, require 23 additional beds to provide proper housing facilities for the female side of the house. In short the capacity of our institution, male and female, is 643, our present population is 724. Therefore, in view of this fact, we are requesting an ap - propriation to construct a receiving hospital building with a capacity for 180 patients and a small building for untidy patients with a capacity for 40 patients.

            <seg id="p015">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 257 erected a building devoted to industrial pursuits, store room, drug room, laboratory, amusement hall, and carpen - ter shop. Laundry The laundry building was remodeled and the old amusement hall transformed into a finishing room for the laundry department. A dry cleaning equipment has been installed where the clothing of patients can be carefully cleaned and pressed. Engine Room A new boiler and generator have been installed in the engine room ; the engine room re-roofed with asbestos roofing, new sky-lights installed and an extension built to the south end of the engine room by which the boiler and the laundry wash room were enlarged. Kitchen and Bake Shop The building formerly used for a store room was re - modeled, re-inforced concrete floors installed and an ex - tension built to the west, partitions were torn out and ce - ment floors constructed and a new bake oven built. New steel bread troughs, proofing ovens and mixer were in - stalled. New flooring has been installed on the various wards and in the dining rooms on the male side of the house. The wooden casings and wainscoting have been removed on most of the wards in the old main building and cement construction has replaced the wooden structure. Out Building! A new slaughter house of cement construction was built, the same is sanitary in every way and of value to the department. A new vegetable house of solid brick and concrete con - struction size 22x60 ft. with a super-structure intended for vegetable drying room and incubator house. A new cattle shed has been built at the west farm, placed upon stone foundation and of quite permanent con - struction. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">258 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF An appropriation of $20,000 voted by the legislature of 1913 has been expended for the equipping of the two new hospital buildings, known as building "H" and building C." An appropriation of $5,000 voted by the legislature of 1913 has been expended for the installation of complete equipment for the scientific administration of hydrotherapy ; one equipment in the male hospital building and one in the female hospital building. Cement sidewalks have been constructed, connecting the outlying buildings with a main center walk leading from the front of the hospital to the front entrance of the hospital grounds. Lights have been installed on the cam- pus and a drive circumscribing the entire campus. Ter- races have been thrown up in the rear of the new hospital in an effort to increase the parking of land adjacent to the hospital.

            <seg id="p018">■&gt;, 260 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS To relieve the present congestion in the hospital and to provide suitable housing facilities for the prospective commitments the State should build a receiving hospital for acute cases, the building to have a capacity of 180 patients. A building corresponding in structure and archi - tecture to the building commonly used for tuberculous pa - tients would afford housing capacity for our untidy patients at a much lower cost per bed than our present housing ca - pacity for this type of patients. A separate building for the housing of employees would add materially to the ca - pacity of our wards for the reception of patients and, at the same time, afford more pleasant environment for our employees, resulting in more efficient work. The present greenhouse occupies a position on the front lawn, the engine room of which lies directly in front of the new women's hospital building, obstructing the view therefrom and interfering with the general scenic beauty of the campus. This structure should be moved to a po - sition back of the engine room and adjacent to the garden. The heating of this building should be accomplished by ex - haust steam of the engine room, thereby minimizing the cost of maintenance. If the State is to continue the lighting plant at the Hospital for the Insane a Corliss engine must be installed to replace the one now in use, which is badly worn. AMUSEMENTS The new amusement hall is a valuable asset to the institution; more varied amusements can be employed for the entertainment of patients. The local artists have on several occasions given us musical programs gratuitously. Professor and Mrs. Molzer of Lincoln have been especially kind and considerate in giving a number of beautiful pro - grams. The same are greatly enjoyed by our people. CHAPLAIN Dr. Stuff has served the institution in his very efficient manner as chaplain in the Sunday morning service, has </seg>

He has in many in - stances influenced directly the life of the patient and has carefully cultivated the moral tone of the whole institu - tion. We feel deeply indebted to Dr. Stuff, who faithfully ministers to the institution at a sacrifice to himself. OCCUPATIONAL PURSUITS The sewing room, the art department and the various domestic duties about the institution provide occupational pursuit for our female patients. The carpenter shop, shoe repair, furniture repair, farm, garden, engine room, laun - dry, chicken house, dairy, greenhouse and lawn provide oc - cupational pursuit for our male patients. The art department is conducted more particularly as a school in which certain types are instructed in simple duties and developed to take their place in the different departments of the institution where their service is both practical and pleasant. The sewing room performs a most useful function in the manufacture of clothing and bedding for the institu - tion. A summary of the articles manufactured is given. Total number of articles manufactured 18,475 EMPLOYEES The schedule of salaries paid employees is far too low considering the character of the work.

A civil service law enacted would, however, demand a careful con - sideration of the personal equation as well as the intel - lectual attainment of the applicant and incidentally should repose in those in authority in the institution the power to remove those temperamentally unfit for service in the high - ly specialized work of an institution of this character. A civil service law supported by sufficient funds to work out the merit system and safe-guarded in its administration by those having a keen insight into the requirements of institutional work might improve the condition of our in - stitution in that it would lend continuity of service. DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY In this department there has been much routine work. Wasserman of blood and spinal fluid are done on all in - dicated cases. During the biennial period the summary of the work amounts to as follows: Urinalysis 800 Stomach analysis 20 Throat cultures examined 35 Sputum Blood examinations — Jl Blood counts, slides, etc 850 Widal tests 6 Serum — Wasserman 200 Butyric acid 150 Feces examinations 4 Spinal punctures 103 SURGICAL DEPARTMENT In the surgical department of the institution there have been during the biennium 20 major surgical operations. There have been 2200 minor surgicals and dressings on the male side of the house and 2500 minor surgicals and dress - ings on the female side of the house. I want to acknowledge my keen appreciation of the valuable services rendered by those associated with me in the work. There are in the institution many who are serv - ing the State in a most creditable manner worthy of pro - motion and of consideration for their good services. </seg>
