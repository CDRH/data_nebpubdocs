SNYDER.* INTBODUCTION. {In this bulletin under "Preliminary Period" we give the llts of feeding 30 calves on a ration chiefly of corn and alfalfa ing the winter of 1910-1911, and under "Experiment Proper" give Hie results of feeding five lots of calves on different ions during the winter of 1911-1912 and the results of duplicat - this test during the winter of 1912-1913. There is no attempt :orrelate the results of the preliminary period with those of experiment proper. When comparing the results from the various rations we have considered only the profit from the calves and have not in - cluded the profit from the hogs following the calves, as a large part of the gain on the hogs came from grain fed direct to the hogs. The actual value of the waste from the rations is calcu - lated in Table 16. PRELIMINARY PERIOD. November 8, 1910. to June 23, 1911. The work reported in this bulletin was started in a prelim - inary way by feeding one carload of 30 calves in the winter of 1910-1911. Rome of these calves were raised on the Substation farm. The remainder were bought near North Platte. They were selected in order to have them fairly uniform in size. The animals were grade Shorthorn, Hereford, and Angus. There were 8 heifers and 22 steers. The calves were fed in a lot having an open shed and a con - stant water supply. The forage consisted of alfalfa with a small amount of prairie hay. The calves were given all they would eat. They were not required to eat all the alfalfa stems. The grain BThe author is indebted to Mr. B. M.

We have assigned to this feed the following prices: When these calves were put in the feed lot they weighed I!I3 pounds, or 453 pounds each. The calves cost $4 per 100 nds when taken from the cows, weighed without any shrink The foregoing weight was taken after they had lteen weaned nt three weeks. We presume, therefore, that the cost of the es was about |4.10 per 100 pounds, or $ 18.57 per head. The of the 30 head was $557.31.

The total increase [lie weight of the hogs was 4.(Mifl pounds. There were fed to hogs 17!) bushels of corn, or a little lew* than 250 pounds of u for each 100 pounds of gain in weight.

FORAGE AND GRAIN RATIONS FOR FATTENING CALVES UNDER WESTERN NEBRASKA CONDITIONS. PURPOSE OF EXPERIMENT. The purpose of the experiment was to collect data which would tend to determine the case of fattening calves when fed rations adapted to this locality. Prairie hay and corn have ceased to be a common ration, tho possibly a few farmers still fatten cattle on these feeds. Alfalfa has come into common use where it can be obtained without hauling it too great a distance. Where alfalfa cannot be secured, cottonseed cake is being fed to balance the ration of corn and hay. Silage is just coming into use in western Nebraska. The experiment was planned so that it would give some evidence of the value of silage and the com- parative values of alfalfa and cottonseed cake. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Feeding Baby Beef 9 DURATION OF EXPERIMENT. The first test was conducted during the winter of 1911 and 1912, beginning on November 14, 1911, and ending June 25. 1912, having been in progress 221? days. This test was duplicated the following winter, beginning on October 31, 1912, and ending June 21,. 1913. The duration of this test was 233 days. THE CALVES. I The calves were grade Shorthorn and Hereford. There were &gt;ut the same number of heifers as of steers. The majority of ni ran with their mothers during the summer, tho a few were d raised. All were good thrifty calves in medium flesh when into the feed lots. There were 15 calves in each lot during first test, excepting Lot 3 in which there were 14. There were in each lot during the second test. The calves were born ly in the spring preceding the winters they were fed. The rage age when the tests began was about 7 months. The res were about 14 or 15 months old when marketed. The rage weight of the calves when the tests began was 441 pounds h, and when the tests closed the average weight was 856 inds each. The calves nearly doubled their weight while in feed lots. PEED LOTS. tEach lot of calves ran in a lot containing about one-half acre, ■re was an open shed 22 by 30 feet, and a water tank in cadi 1 lot. The drainage was good. Grain and forage were fed he open. WEATHER CONDITIONS. During the winter of 1911-1912 the weather was unusually severe and very unfavorable for making large gains. The winter of 1912-1913 was unusually open, even for this region, and very favorable for making gains at a minimum cost. WEIGHT. I The calves were weighed in the morning before feeding, on ee consecutive days, at the beginning and the end of the feed - period. The water tanks were closed the previous evening. s calves were also weighed on each second Tuesday thruout tests. The alfalfa and prairie hay were weighed by the wagon - cl as they were hauled to the feed lots. The silage and grain ■e weighed on small scales at each feeding time. The calves •e fed twice daily. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 I fling Baby Beef RATIONS FED. II taring the winter of 1911-1912. five lots of 16 calves each were the following rations. The same rations were fed to five lots 11 calves each during the winter of 1912-1913: II. — Prairie hay, corn 90 per cent, cottonseed cake 10 per rent. 2. — Alfalfa 72 jkt cent, prairie hay 28 per cent, corn. 3. — Alfalfa 50 per cent, silage 50 per cent, corn. 4. — PnMe hay 47 per cent, silage 53 per cent, corn. 5. — Prairie hay 45 per cent, silage 55 per cent, corn 90 per cent, cottonseed cake 10 per cent. There was a very little prairie hay fed to Lot 3. BThe ration fed to Lot 1 might l&gt;e recommended to the feeder i has neither alfalfa nor silage. The results from Lot 5 should w the effect of adding silage to this ration. BThe ration fed to Lot 2 is the standard ration for the feeder ) does not have silage. The results of Lot 3 should show the et of adding silage to this ration. The ration fed to Lot 4 contains no feed having a high |&gt;er - centage of protein. It is considered an unbalanced ration. By comparing the results secured from this ration with the results from Lot ."!. one should see the effects of substituting alfalfa for prairie hay in a ration of prairie hay. corn silage, and corn. BA comparison of the results of I&lt;ot ."&gt; with those of Lot 4 nld show the effects of adding cottonseed cake to a ration of irie hay. corn silage, and corn. FEEDS. f^he prairie hay and alfalfa were usually of go&lt;xl quality. The i usually graded No. 3, but some of it graded lower. As I le. it was of a rather poor quality. The cottonseed cake was usually obtained from the cotton oil mills. It was cold sed and was sold as containing 28 per cent protein. The je fed during 1911-1912 was made from corn that was injured Iry weather. If it had been harvested it would have yielded i 3 to 5 bushels per acre. The silage fed during the follow - winter was made from corn that would have yielded 2." t&lt;&gt; M iels per acre. MANNER OF FEEDING. The grain ration began with about 5 jMiunds per head daily. reaching 10 pounds in about 3 months. From about that Time until the end of the feeding i»eriod the grain ration was raised </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Feeding Baby Beef 11 as fast an the calves would stand the increase without going off feed. In fact, the grain ration from the iK'ginning was increased nearly as fast as the calves would take it without injurious effects. The largest amount of grain fed was 18 pounds per day near the end of the feeding per tod. This was in the spring of 1912. The most grain eaten j»er head daily in 1013 wag 14.50 pounds. t During the first season all lots were kept on practically the le amount of grain, tho at times some lots held the others k. The calves in Lot 4 — fed prairie hay, silage, and corn — •e the poorest feeders. After April 1, of the second season, other lots were not held hack for Lot 4. At the end of the ling period the calves in Lot 4 were eating from one to four inds less grain per head daily than the calves in the other lots. I Silage was fed to Lots 3. 4. and "&gt;. Each lot was fed nearly same amount. Lot 4 ate slightly less silage during the first than the other two lots. There were fed nearly the same niter of jxmnds of silage as of hav to these three lots. The rage amount of silage fed per calf daily was 7.07 pounds, endeavored to keep Lots 3 and 5, which were fed silage, eating ■ut the same amount of grain as Lots 1 and 2, which were not silage. When the silage was raised to more than 10 pounds calf daily, there was a decrease in the amount of grain eaten. Tables 17 and 1S show in detail the amount of silage and grain fed daily per head and the times the rations were increased. These tables also show that the amount of grain and silage was reduced at times. This occurred only when the calves were being fed too much. PRICES OF PEED. It is always difficult to decide the prices that should be used in recording the results of an experiment. The prices actually paid for the feed may have little relation to those being paid by the man who reads the bulletin. Values may also flnctuate greatly while the exjteriment is in progress. In order that the results of different experiments may be compared readily, it is necessary that uniform prices be used thruout. In Tables 3, 4. .". and 11 we have used as nearly as possible the prices we paid for foodstuff during the two years that the tests were being con - ducted. In other tables we have used various prices so as to show the effect of different prices on the cost of gains and on the </seg>

The 7 way the farmer can make these data apply accurately to conditions is to calculate the items of cost from the amount eed used to produce 100 pounds of gain, using the prices of the forage and grain on his own farm or at his own market. PRICES OF CATTLE AND HOGS. rPhe purchase price of the calves put into the feed lots in 1911 about ?4.40 per 100 pounds. The cost of the calves put into feed lots in 1912 was about $6.50 per 100 pounds. Irhe following table gives the purchase price of the calves, the ■e for which the calves sold in Omaha, and the "spread," or erence between the buying price and the selling price. Each was sold on its merits. Tt was our opinion, when the calves e in the feed lots, that Lots 1 and 5 would sell at the same •e. The exjtense of shipping and selling was 30.7 cents per pounds. The Omaha weight was 25 pounds less per calf than final weight taken in the feed lot : Table 1. — Buying and selling price by lots and years, and aver- It will be noted later that the calves made faster gains and ate less feed per 100 pounds of gain during the second than dnring the first winter, and also that, in spite of this, the first winter's feeding was much more profitable than the second.

            <seg id="p013">Feeding Baby Beef 13 between the buying price and the selling price in the table above accounts for the difference in the profit of the two winters, being in favor of the winter in which the calves did not feed so well. The "spread" in prices of the first winter was $3.02 per 100 ponnds and of the second winter $1.70 per 100 pounds. I Phis was a net pain of $2.22 per 100 pounds, or about |20 per 1, for the cnlves fed during the first winter, due entirely to difference in the "spread" of the buying and soiling prices of two years. This difference is greater than the net profit per during either winter.

The second winter was open, with few storms. This difference had ■■ unfavorable effect on all stock ted during the tirst winter. The calves fed during the first winter were not all of as high grade as those fed during the second wintei-. There were a few wild, restless calves among th. is., in the tirst test. There was 19 pa cent more grail and 28 ]&gt;er cent more forage eaten per 10(1 pounds increase in weight during the first winter than iuiug the second winter. Vlie average gain per calf in the second test was 10.15 per more than in the tirst test. The relative performance of Ihe five lots was almost the same during both tests. The relative gains were practically the same, excepting that Lot .1 was higher than Lot 1 in the tirst test, and Lot 1 higher than Lot ."&gt; in the second test. The rank according tc the amount of grain eaten for 1(10 pounds of gain was the same during lioth ti sis. The forage eaten per 100 I ounds of gain was nearly equal for Lots 1 and 2. These two lots changed places in rank during the two winters in this re - gard. Lots :i anil ."&gt; changed places in rank during the two win - ters in regard to the forage eaten for KM) pounds of gain. IPhe relative gains as shown in TaMr I and the food required roduee 100 pounds of gain as shown in Talde 7 indicate that various rations gave much man nearly the san;e results dur the second winter, when conditions were faverahle. than dur - the first winter, when conditions were unfavorable.

GAIN'S. f.ot :!. fed alfalfa, silage, and corn, made the fastest gains winter. The average daily gain during the two testa of the ps in this lot was 2.07 pounds, or a total gain of 472 pounds calf during each feeding period. This more than doubled initial weisrht. I Lot 2. fed alfalfa, prairie hav. ai'd corn, were second in rate rain with a daily average gain of 1. !&gt;(■&gt;. or a total gain of 448 nds.

            <seg id="p022">This table, with the prices here given to the feed, shows that the cost of 100 pounds of gain in Lots 2 and 3 was very nearly equal. The cost of 100 pounds of gain in Lots 1 and 5 was also nearly equal. I Calculating in various ways we always arrive at the conclu - i that the ration fed to Lot 3 gave the most profitable results. h the ration fed to Lot 2 second. Lot 1 shows more profit n Lot 5, but this is due principally to the higher selling price L&lt;ot 1 over Lot 5.

COMPARATIVE VALUES OF FOODSTUFFS. iln the following discussion we endeavor to show the compara values of some of the foodstuffs used in this experiment so as the results of the opertaeat indicate comparative values, ■e the two years' results an similar, we feel that some reli - t may be placed on the comparisons made and that the feeds ■ compared may be expected to give results somewhat similar he results here indicated when used in the rations fed in this ertaart and under the conditions prevailing during the ex - ment. VALVE OF ALFALFA. BThe value of alfalfa is shown by comparing Lots 2 and 3, in ich the rations contained alfalfa, with Lots 1, 4. and ."&gt;. in ch there was no alfalfa. I Table 14 shows that Lots .'! and 1' made faster gains with i grain and less forage per 1(1(1 nounds of gain than any of the i that were not fed alfalfa. Regardless of the price of feed, cost of Kid pounds of gain was always less and the profit i»er P always more in Lots 3 and 2 than in any lot not fed alfalfa, no respect did cottonseed cake or sihge. or cottonseed cake I silage make profitable substitutes for alfalfa. Ry comparing the results obtained from Lots 3 and 4 we tii-d the effect of using alfalfa rather than prairie hay where the '•&lt; -matnder of the ration is corn ;md corn silage. Lot •? was fed alfalfa, corn, and silage. Lot 4 was fed prairie hay, corn, and silage. The calves in Lot 3 gained .44 pound per head daily more than those in Lot 4. They ate 118 pounds less corn and 148 pounds less hay and silage to proton 100 pounds of gain than the calves in Lot 4. The cost of 100 nounds of gain was more than fl less in Lot 3 than in Lot 4. The average relative jrofit per calf as given in Table 13 is 100 for the calves in Lot 3 :&gt;r&lt;l :?f) for the calves in Lot 4.

This is presuming that the silage contained &lt;!0 per cent more water than other forage. The cost of Hill pounds of gain was nearl.v the same for both lots. When the price of silage was raised to $4 or more j&gt;er ton. the gains in Lot .". fed silage, cost more than the gains in Lot 1, not fed silage. When silage was $3 per ton. the cost of gains in Lot 5 was than in Lot 1. With the prices as given in Table 11, Lot 1 made the cheaper gains. The selling price of Lot 1 was f8.2. r &gt; jmt LM pounds the first year and $8.30 the second year, the average price Iteing $8.28. The selling price of Lot 5 was $8 the first year and 9&amp;M the second year, the average l»eing $8.15. With the selling price 13 cents per 100 pounds in favor of Lot 1, this lot gave more profit than Lot "&gt; regardless of the cost of feed. If the selling price had Iteen the same for both lots the profits would have I&gt;een altout equal, unless the price of silage had been more than $4 j&gt;er ton. According to the results of Lots 1 and 5. it would lie profitable to add silage to a ration of prairie hay. coin, and cottonseed cake only in case the price of the silage were fl.fiO per ton or lower. This is considering the selling prices given above as representing the actual relative values of calves fattened on these two rations. VAI.1E OK COTTONSEED TAKE.

COTTONSEED CAKE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ALFALFA The value of cottonseed cake as a substitute for alfalfa is shown In comparing the results obtained from Lot 6, fed prairie hav. corn, cottonseed cake, and silage, and Lot 3. fed alfalfa, corn. and silage. I The rations of these two lots were similar except that in Lot irairie hay and cottonseed cake took the place occupied by ilfa in Lot 3. In every comparison made in Table 14 or else - &gt;re. Lot 3. fed alfalfa, gives more satisfactory results than 5, fed prairie hay and cottonseed cake. The relative prof - as given in the average in Table 13 show that Lot 3 gave rly twice as much net profit as Lot 5. The average calf in 3 ate .92 ton of alfalfa and gave a profit of $7.66 to |8.45. tending on the price of foodstuffs, above the profit given by average calf in Lot 5. which ate prairie hay and cottonseed e instead of alfalfa. The price of alfalfa might have been re than doubled before it would have been profitable to have laced it with prarie hay and cottonseed cake.

PROFIT FROM HOGS FATTENED WITH CALVES I Thus far in this bulletin we have not considered the profit lie from the hogs that were fed with the calves. In the first t there were 8 pigs with each lot of calves from November 14. 1. until May 14. Ifl12. The average first weight of the pigs ? 102 pounds and the average last weight 286 pounds. The rage daily gain was .99 pound per head. These pigs were fed the average 314 pounds of corn and 31 ponndB of alfalfa hay each 100 pounds of gain. The effect of being with the calves r a reduction in the amount of feed eaten for 100 pounds of n about equal to the reduction made by alfalfa pasture. This nip of 40 pigs was marketed May 14 at $7.25 per 100 pounds home weights. (Five lots of eight fall pigs, weighing 122 nonnds each, took place vacated by the pigs just sold.

They were fed 102 pounds of grain for each 100 pounds of increase in weight. It is noted immediately that this group made much cheaper gains than the preceding group. At least two factors assist in accounting for this difference. The pigs of the second group were younger and smaller than those of the first group and the calves were on full feed while the second group was being fattened. The gains and profits of the pigs are shown under the calf lot numbers in Table 15. I At the beginning of the second test, October 31, 1913, 8 pigs, ighing 92 pounds each, were put with each lot of 13 calves, ese pigs were marketed March 31, 1913, when the average ight was 2G3 pounds per head. The average daily gain of se pigs was 1.11 pounds per head. They were fed 389 pounds corn and 22 pounds of alfalfa hay for each 100 pounds in - ase in weight.

These g were marketed with the calves June 23, 1913. Their aver - weight when sold was 202 pounds. The selling price on home ghts was $8.15 per 100 pounds. The average daily gain of se pigs was 1.07 pounds per head. They were fed 192 pounds n and 11 pounds alfalfa hay for each 100 pounds increase in ght. The gains and the profits of the pigs are shown under calf lot numbers in Table 15. I During the two years there were produced 19,724 pounds in - »se in weight of hogs. The feed given direct to the hogs cost 3.54, considering corn worth 55 cents per bushel and alfalfa $7.50 per ton. The cost of 100 pounds of gain was $2.96. I average selling price of the hogs was $7.78. The profit on hogs was $952.12. or equal to $6.85 for each calf fed. </seg>

The Its are given in Table 16. Ifhe actual value of the waste from the calves is so small that ns very little influence on the comparative values of the ra - 8 fed. If all the profit from the hogs is credited to the calves, comparative effects of the several rations are obscured be - le of the large profit from the hogs. For these reasons we ! not included any profit from the waste when discussing the five values of the rations. I It in customary to credit to the cattle all the profit from the p. Since this is customary, we have done this in Tables 3, 4, I 5 and in the second column of Table 16. About 00 j&gt;er cent of the feed of the hogs was corn, fed direct to them. It would not KM correct to credit to the calves the profit inside on the corn fed direct to the hogs. Therefore, in the third column in Table 16 we credit the cattle with the profit made by the hogs on the waste from the cattle. I But it may be more nearly correct to credit the calves with y the value of the waste from them as represented by the corn t this waste saved when eaten by the hogs. There were re - red by several lots of hogs during these two winters about 500 inds of corn to produce 100 pounds of gain. The hogs that re with the calves ate 300 pounds of corn besides the waste in the calves in producing 100 pounds of gain. It seems, there - p, that the waste from the calves saved 200 pounds of corn each 100 pounds of gain on the hogs. In the fourth column Table 16 we credit the calves with this corn at 55 cents per ihel, and in the fifth column we have placed the value of the ste per calf as shown by the value of the corn saved. EFFECT OF PROFIT FROM HOGS ON VALUE OF CALP RATIONS. I The effect of the gain of the hogs on the relative values of rations fed to the calves is to raise the relative values of the ions fed to Lot 1 and Lot 4. Lot 4 was fed prairie hay, corn ige, and corn. This lot ranked so low in every respect that n with the slight advantage given it by the hogs, it still gives per calf less profit than Lot 5, which is next in rank. Lot 3 stands so high in all comparisons that the profit from the hogs affects its standing but little. Lot 2 still stands near Lot 3. </seg>

When no value is attached to the waste from the calves, Lot 1 gives a profit of $2.03 per head more than the calves in Lot 5. But if we allow the value from the waste as represented by the corn saved to appear as evidence, Lot 1 ranks above Lot 5, with a profit per calf of $2.29 in its favor. r.E 16.* — Average profit per calf, with and without profit from hogs, and with part of profit from hogs; also value of corn stared by waste from each calf. A rerage of two years. t It is presumed that it would have required 500 pounds of corn to produce 1U0 pounds of gain if the hogs had not been fed with the calves. The profit from the hogs is prorated to the hogs and to the cattle in pro - portion to the amount of grain fed directly to the hogs per 100 pounds of gain and the amount furnished by the cattle. X This is calculated as in the note above excepting that the cattle are credited— not with the profit on the hogs, but with the feed that ther furnished the hogs, valuing the corn saved at 55 cents per bushel.
