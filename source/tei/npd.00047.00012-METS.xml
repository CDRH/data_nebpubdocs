            <seg id="p003">SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND CO.MMEUCK November 15th, 1919. Hon. Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor Sir: Herewith I submit the 27th annual report of Building and Loan Associations of Nebraska for the year ending June 30th, 1919, and invite your careful attention. This report covers the activities of seventy-four associations and reveals the largest volume of business ever transacted by the Nebraska associations in their history. Only one new asso - ciation was formed during the year — the Knox County Building and Loan Association at Bloomfield. One association liquidated — The Workingmen's Savings and Loan Association of York. One association — The Building and Loan Association, Fairfield. was taken over by the Occidental Building and Loan Associa - tion of Omaha. The limited field and small volume of their business did not warrant a continuation. The total resources of these seventy-four associations show an increase during the year of $8,616,513.86 or 15 per cent and the increase in income and disbursements amounted to $10,179. - 476.30, or 25 per cent. Loans in process of foreclosure and delinquent interest account both show. a decrease indicating increased efficiency in manage - ment and approval of loans. Ninety-nine per cent of association loans are secured by real estate on a basis of 53 per cent of appraised value. As an illustration of the utility of the associations it is shown that 112,868 persons are share owners, approximately one out of every twelve persons in the state. The associations' laws seem to be applicable to the objects in view and no legislation is recommended. Nebraska stands very high in the scale of association develop - ment and has every reason to feel proud of the magnificent work accomplished and thousands of happy homes in this state owe their existence to this source. Very respectfully J. E. HART. Sec'y Department Trade and Commerce. </seg>
