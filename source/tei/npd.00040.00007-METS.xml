If land can lie irrigated in the fall with the same care that crops are irrigated in the summer, there is an advantage to fall irrigation. If water cannot Ik? properly cared for and i his irriga lion is uneven, it is a detriment rather than a benefit to the land. II is a disadvantage to ditch the |totatoes as dt-ep on tin lighter soils as on the heavier soils. With the exception of the tirst crop it is Itest to irrigate alfalfa after the hay is cut. Irrigation of the siulilde is More easily and more evenly done than the standing crop The hay will cure more quickly on the dry soil than on previously irrigated soil. There is no material difference in the yields in sugar lieets where the soil is plowed from 4 to I'O indies deep. This may lie due to the fact that the soil is of a sandier nature. The plowing under of a second and third crop of alfalfa has not produced as large tonnage of sugar lwets as the second and third crops that were plowed under. </seg>

INTRODUCTION 1 1 is the ambition nf inns) fanners in produce the largest pos - sible yields of which tin- land is capable, provided that the cos! of production allows a sufficient income to warrant the extra lal»or required to produce the larger yield. In the humid areas the in - creased yield is accomplished to a large extent liy the use of manure and such other methods as will encourage plant growth. On the irrigated lands, many are trying to force increased yields by tlie increased use of water, rather than liy other means. Water, however, can never Ik- made to take the place of soil fertility or cultivation. It appears from observation that to ■ certain point fertility may replace water. In other words, the more fertile soils utilize moisture more efficiently, with the proi&gt;er 1 1-( at incut. The heavier soils likewise require less irrigation water than tlie sandy soil. The lighter soils lose a large amount of water thru seepage, whereas it may lie retained in a heavier soil. SEEPAGE. Nearly all irrigated lands are subjected to damage thru seep - age lo a greater or lesser extent upon certain low |M»ints or areas. This seepage is lirought about by a number of conditions, some of which may l&gt;e prevented or modified, but many cannot l»e avoided. Tlie unavoidable conditions are due to the various strata of * The Scottsbluff Experiment Farm is located on the North Platte Reclamation Project, six miles east of Mitchell and eight miles northwest of Scottsbluff, Nebraska. The tract consists of 160 acres of land, irrigated from the Government canal. About 30 acres are devoted to experiments in dry land agriculture, and the remainder is irrigated, a wide variety of experiments being conducted with irrigated crops. The work of the farm is maintained cooperatively by the University of Nebraska and the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and is under the direction of a Superintendent detailed by the Office of Western Irrigation Agriculture, U. S. Department of Agriculture. HI I. UN, AUK.

It has been found thai in many cases large basins are formed by this impervious subsoil. and this also has a tendency to hold the water as seepage. *•• v I r^ Some seepage may be prevented by letter means and methods of irrigation. In all crop work under irrigation the first con sideration should be to secure the best possible results from the least amount of water applied. IRRIGATION To irrigate properly requires time and is a costly operatioa. By using an excessive amount of water the cost of the extra water, together with the labor of irrigation, does not always in - crease the crop sufficiently to justify the expense. Many irrigators are under the impression that, as the amount of water applied to the crop is increased, in a like proportion the crop yield is increased. In other words, if 1 acre-foot of water will produce 25 bushels of wheat. "_' acre-feet should be capable of producing approximately 50 bushels. No grain crop will produce in the same ratio as the water is applied; in fact, water applied Ih'VoikI a certain limit lias a tendency to decrease the yield rather than to increase it. IRRIGATION HEAD It is not necessarily true that, because a large amount of water is applied to a crop in one or two irrigations, the crop gets the benefit from all of the water thus pal oi&gt; the land at the point of turnout. Two large losses of irrigation water must be taken into &lt;-..n sideration — run-off and underground seepage. The run-off is al - ways apparent and may Ik; reduced to a minimum by the careful irrigator by always catching the run-off from one ditch in the other, the only waste Iteing in the end runs and on the lasi land. This run-off loss is well taken care of by most of our farmers, but the seepage loss has not been called to the attention of the irri - gator as forcibly as it should be, for the reason that it is a condi - tion that is not easily detected. STORING WATER IN THE SOIL. Boil is capable of storing and holding only a certain amount of water. Inasmuch as roots of plants penetrate and feed on the soil to only a limited depth, all water in the soil that is above the water holding capacity of that soil is waste. It percolates to soil areas Itelow the reach of the roots and is carried off, usually crop- </seg>
            <seg id="p007">MaiKKjcmcnt of Irrigated Land. 7 piiiH out at some place in the form of seepage. Furthermore, it is useless labor to saturate the soil to a greater depth than the plants are capable of feeding. Knowledge of the subsoil is a great aid in a better under - standing of the application of water. On the lighter soils where then is a sandy or gravelly subsoil, labor is wasted in trying to ■tore very much moisture in such a soil; lighter and more frequent Irrigation alone will solve that problem. On heavy soil, or a deep soil, water may be stored to advantage. If the lighter soil has a Hay subsoil, water may also be stored, but a sandy subsoil cannot be used as a reservoir for storing soil water for future crop use. DISTANCE APART OF IRRIGATION DITCHES. Shorter runs of water, that is, placing the supply ditches closer together, will often overcome much of the trouble of under - ground loss. It is impossible to state a definite or even an ap - proximate distance between field laterals, as it all depends u|&gt;on the topography of the land and the nature of the soil. This Substation has tried to establish a time factor to deter - mine the distance lietweeu ditches. Here also difficulties are encountered that vary with the head of water used and upon the spread of the water at the turnout. Under ordinary conditions in western Nebraska a run from 1 hour and ."50 minutes to 2 hours should constitute the distance between laterals. [rrigaton on sandy soil frequently try to force water thru rowed crops having runs from 40 to 60 rods long. Often it re - quires from S to 12 hours and sometimes much longer for water in &lt;_'u ihru such rows. The waste of water thru underground seepage in such cases must Ik- readily apparent even to the most QDobaenring irrigator. Even if the waste water factor l&gt;e elim - inated, the labor problem or waste of time in such cases is such as to make methods of this kind prohibitive. DUTY OP WATER. Much work has been done in determining the duty of water, that is. to determine how much water is required to grow a given crop and secure the l»est possible results. An irrigator cannot use this as a liasis for growing and producing a crop, as the duty of water must vary with the climatic conditions. Determining the duty of water has been invaluable in proving that there is a de - cided limit to the amount of water which may profitably be ap - plied to land, also in showing the 'bad effect of overirrigation on the crop. It would be folly for anyone to lay down a rule stating that a given amount of wafer should produce a certain crop yield, </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Management of Irrigated Laud. 8 or That irrigations should l&gt;e applied so far apart or a certain number of irrigations be applied during the growing paffed. The amount of water to use or the number of irrigations de - pends upon climatic conditions, the slo|&gt;e of the land, nature or texture of the soil and subsoil, variety of the crop, ami last upon the stage of growth of the trap. It does not follow that becanae a grain crop has produced a heavy growth of straw it will produce grain in proportion to thai growth. It is more often true that by forcing an undue amount of growth the grain may In- small and shrunken, liecause the stems and leaves require a large amount of moisture that the it - rigator cannot always apply at that stage of the growth. On land partially subjected to seepage the grain is usually plump because the moisture is constant. It is not necessarily tine, as many believe, that the great eel economy of water and labor is in the use of a large head of watei forced over the greatest possible area that this water will cover On very sandy soils a large head may Ik- required, even tho con siderahle washing may take place unless great care is taken Very level land bean a large head of water, in fact raqairca it The more rolling lands should lie handled under small heads, any thing from 1 to l'-j second feet; more often 1 foot is found tin best amount. A large head of water rushing over the land has a tendency to "slick" the soil, where the witter passes over readily, and thiw prevents the proper irrigation. With small heads the run nil need not l&gt;e very large and can l&gt;e better regulated. Rowed crops should l»e carefully planned on rolling land, giv ing the rows just enough fall that the water may lie carried along; without causing any washing. Where water is permitted to rush thru the rows, proper irrigation cannot take place: the washing of the soil and the waste water secured under such conditions are a loss. If the land permits, a fall of 3 inches to 100 feet is a good sIojk* to give the run. altl u the average soil ti inches to 100 feet will not cause much washing, if care is taken in irrigation The conservation of soil moisture is just as essential under irrigation as under any other method of farming, perhaps more so. as the water itself represents value and its application ex - pense. A good system of crop rotation is a means of saving irrigation water. It also brings about a more equitable distribution of the irrigation season. Alfalfa, as is well known, requires more water than any other crop. It is extremely difficult to irrigate evenly a large acreage </seg>

Con - sidering also that alfalfa, if sold off the farm at prevailing local price*, is a poor paying crop, it would be bad management to rely ii|M.n this one cro]i. if not used for feeding pursues on the farm where crown. Seldom do sugar Iteets. iK&gt;tat&lt;K*s. or corn require water early in the season when the small grain requires attention. About the time that the small grain is out of the way of irrigation the rowed crop will require water. Where only alfalfa and small grain are grown the irrigation season is all crowded into one short jteriod. On the lighter soils with a sandy subsoil, it is impossible to irrigate in the hope of storing sufficient water to grow and mature a crop of any kind. Such a procedure, however, may be possible where there is a clay subsoil and the water may be held as in ji basin. A sandy subsoil gives up its water and but a small amount is held in reserve for the plants. Many of the crops, such as jtotatoes, sugar beets, and small rain*, do not feed very deep. Kven tho there may be enough moisture in the lower strata of the soil, it is of no value to the plants. Many irrigators consider a soil well irrigated if the full Made of lhe shovel may Im&gt; pushed into the soil easily. Others dig a hole about a foot or more deep, and if the soil is thoroly satu - rated at that depth, the water is discontinued. The latter method is more satisfactory; it will l»e found that where the shovel blade is used as a tester the soil is often wet much deeper than necessary. Tho the shovel may l»e pushed thru the very soft soil, just beneath this the soil may be almost saturated. Several canvas dams are now on the market that by means of docks ami other devices can be set so as to collapse the dam at a certain time, permitting the water to go on down to a second ■ lain, and so on. My the use of these dams much time as well as labor may 1m- saved, especially during the night runs. Perfect irrigation cannot Ik- exjiecled from these dams, but with a very little trouble the uncovered spots may be gone over tin* following day. As a rule. "."&gt; per cent of the irrigation water is lost during the night runs. This is a large item during the hot, dry weather, when the water is scarce. All end runs should l&gt;e avoided during the night. It is Ik-si to start on a new land for a night run, thus making sure that the waste will not damage adjoining land. FALL IRRIGATION OF CROPS. Work has been conducted for three vears to determine the </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Management of Irrigated Land. value of fall irrigation. The object was to store water iii the soil and have the soil in better condition for field operations in the spring. As a rule the precipitation during the winter is very light, making it necessary at times to irrigate in the spring before some of the crops can be put into the soil to advantage. Many are under the impression that the fall irrigation does not require the attention of general crop irrigation, that it is un - necessary to cover the ground as thoroly, and that to let it run as it will is sufficient. If one has not the time, however, to watch the water and irrigate thoroly. the work had better be left undone. If the ground is carelessly covered, some areas may lie moist enough to germinate the grain quickly; on others it will have t&lt;&gt; lie in the soil until moisture comes to bring it up. This uneven growth will bring about an uneven maturity, hence a poor quality of grain. Some of the grain also may shatter long before a {&gt;or - tion is ready to be cut. One advantage of fall irrigation is that the soil lias an &lt;&gt;|&gt; portunity to freeze and thaw during the winter, thus aiding in putting it in better tilth in the spring. An objection to fall irrigation is the lack of time at that si ;i son of the year, and hence the careless manner in which the watei is likely to be handled. The irrigation at this time of the vein should receive just as much attention as tho a growing crop wen on the ground. Uneven application in the fall will make an uneven crop growth the following year. By allowing water to inn where h will without any attention, or change, for a great length of time, is a waste of water. Such water is very likely to develop into seepage, either on that farm or lower down. As previously stated, when the subsoil has been moistened to a certain depth, anything beyond that depth is waste, for grain crops. This depth is usually from 5 to 6 feet. The first year's work in fall irrigation at this Substation did not include corn; this was added the second year. The crops were grown on one-tenth acre plats, either in duplicate or tripli - cate, depending upon the availability of the land. Table 1 shows the crops grown each year and the rotation that they followed, also the repetition of the crop each year. </seg>

The land was broken out of the virgin sod during the fall of l'.'in and irrigated after plowing. It was necessary to work down the land previous to irrigation. This required considerable use - less labor. In succeeding years the laud was irrigated before plowing. The Held designated as Series VI was irrigated in the fall. Series VI I was not fall irrigated. During the growing seasons each field was irrigated in order as the various crops required it. It was found without exception that the land that was irri gated in the fall did not require as early irrigation in the summer ;md thereby saved considerable labor at that time of the year. Thus, i he expense of the late summer or fall irrigation was paid for. The l»est results were obtained during the cropping season of 1911. This is attributed to the fact that there was a small amount of precipitation during the winter and spring. All soil was very dry at the time of seeding; in many cases irrigation was neces - sary l&gt;efore seeding could be done. That year the wheat was seeded April 4 : the barley and oats were seeded April 20. It may be well perhaj* to state here that untimely rains often interfere with irrigation experiments. Series VI, which was fall irrigated, contained enough mois - ture to bring up all of the small grain, whereas the grain seeded on Series VII did not come thru the ground until after the rains of May 15.

I n 191:2 an experiment was begun to determine if possible the !&gt;t-M method &lt;if irrigating potatoes, taking also into consideration methods of cultivation, labor, and water requirement. The usual practice has been deep cultivation and ditching; the cultivation is often from 5 to 8 inches deep, and when the potatoes* an- property ditched the ridges are over 1 foot high. In common practice every row is irrigated thruout the season after irrigation once beeoaMa necessary. The Method of applying water in ihe experiment has been: Pint, to irrigate every row, keeping the soil moist and the plant! in a growing condition. Second, not to irrigate until the plants require water, then irrigate every row and irrigate according to common farm prac - tice. Third, irrigate every row, but permitting the plants to suffer between irrigations. Fourth, to irrigate alternate rows at such times as the crop requires water. At the first irrigation every other row was skipped; at the second irrigation the skipjted rows were irrigated and the previously irrigated rows omitted. This switching back an. I forth was continued thruout the irrigation season. Fifth, to irrigate every other row thruout the season, that is, set of alternate rows did not receive any irrigation whatever. One of the objects sought in this work was to reduce the labor of irrigation and the use of water to the minimum. No definite results can be given from the three years' work, but some valuable data have been collected with special reference to irrigation. In the three years" work it was found that it is unnecessary to cultivate and ditch as deep on light soil as on the heavy soil. The yield of marketable tubers has been in favor of the more shallow culture. By shallow cultivation is meant the working of the soil from :{ to i inches; the ditching is about 8 inches deep. The depth of the ditching must vary with the fall of the land to a large extent. On the land where there is but little fall and the water moves slowly the ditches must be deeper; otherwise the water in the furrow may get too high on the ridge and submerge the tubers in water, a condition that is detrimental to the crop. Where the fall is such that the water moves freely, the shallow ditching will give the best results. Untimely rains interfered with the methods of irrigation dur ing 1912 and 1913. In 1914, however, the conditions for irrigation </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 JhiHtiffement of Irrii/ated Lmnl. experiments were most excellent, ami the water movement in tht soil could l»e observed to {food advantage. In the case of alternate and every -other wmm Irrigatioa it was thought enough water could be stored in the soil t&lt;. ewrry the crop a longer time than where water was applied in every row. On alternate and every -ot hern, w irrigation, only one half us much irrigated surface was exposed for eraporatioB, Init the amount of water required was not affected by this; on the con - trary more water was required. The water for irrigation was run thru 1 inch iron pipes &gt;unk into the soil at the head of each row. Hy this means the water could lie well regulated, and the approximate time of running with an equal head gave the comparative a unts of water used. 1'nder the usual method it required approximately 2 hours and :«» minutes for the water to run thru rows 204 feet long and thoroly irrigate them: where water was run in alternate row* it required .". hours running, and then the soil was not in as good condition as where every row was irrigated. Considering the tin f ruining, approximately the mm amount of water was used in every instance, hut in the alterna'. and the every-other row irrigations the run oil was v.r\ large causing much waste of water. The lateral or side movement id the water being very small, a deeper sal mat ion was secured ami a large amount of this no doulit was lost as underground seepage and was too deep t&lt;&gt; lie of anv value to the potato eroo &lt;&gt;n plats where the soil was kept moist thruoin i| lr season a the plants in a growing e lition ii required only aboal one ho for the water to run thru the tows. It is unnecessary to wei t soil more than three feet deep for potatoes. l!v keeping the » moist is not meant keeping it saiuraied: a continuously w mtiiiuouslv v soggy soil saturated to its greatest |MN«ible depth is perhaps ii worst condition that can be created for ihis crop. A mass ..I ni prolific vines is usually the result from loo much water. Iu the irrigation no allowance was made for the deep and shallow cultivation, hut in every instance it was found that ihose rows which were ditched deep were not as well watered ax the shallow ditched rows. This was due to the fact that the down - ward movement of the water is much greater than the lateral movement. Hence, the roots did not benefit so much from the water: only a small portion of the main root system came in cob - tact with the water. </seg>

ALFALFA. Alfalfa is one of the leading crops, tho it is far from Iteing a I'iditahle crop, if only the hay is sold as such upon the market. \Vh» -re the hay is fed to live stock and the alfalfa stubble is turned under every four or five years, then alfalfa Incomes a profitable &lt;r«ip. One of the greatest values of alfalfa is the effect it has m ni her crops after it is plowed tinder; the fertilizing value of it is greater than manure when the latter is applied at the rate of 12 I mis (mm- acre.

The figures were taken from a compilation made by Mr. Paul Rothi from the annual census taken on Reclamation Projects. In many cases the crop yields were increased over ion per cent by plowing under alfalfa stubble. SEEDING ALFALFA Many farmers dislike to break tip alfalfa, as sonic have ex perienced a little difficulty in securing ■ fii»»l stand. Some time has been devoted to methods of seeding alfalfa. As with other crops, no hard and fast rules can Ik- laid down for this: much depends upon the soil conditions. Three methods have 1k*«*ii fol - lowed, all of them more or less successful. Spring seeding without a nurse crop has some years given ex - cellent results, and has produced one and sometimes two jtimh' cuttings the same season. The objection to such seeding is that some years the weeds will get started at about the same lime as the alfalfa, and it is necessary to clip these, thus entailin» extra labor at a time of the year when it is not readily available. The second method i8 the seeding of alfalfa with a nurse crop In common practice this is the most popular method.

            <seg id="p019">Management of Irrigated Lund. 19 vantage of this is the failure of securing a good stand; uneven stands are very common. It often happens when the grain is almost ripe that the alfalfa should have water. The question then is whether one should take the chances of the grain lodging by an untimely irrigation or let the alfalfa take the chances of drouth. Another hardship on the young alfalfa conies after the nurse crop is cut. The young plants that have been growing in the shade of the grain are suddenly exposed to the hot sun; if the soil is moist there is no danger of the plants suffering very much. How - ever, should the soil be very dry, then there is a great loss thru ilrving up of the small plants. The third method that has been practiced very successfully for the past three years is stubble seeding. After the grain Crop has Ixfii removed, the alfalfa is seeded into the stubble. This method of seeding permits the seeding of a full crop of grain instead of a lighter seeding, as required by a nurse crop. The soil, if too dry. should be irrigated previous to seeding, or, as on the sandier soils, it may be "irrigated up." The earlier this stubble Meding is done the better it is. The seeding may be done as late as August 25. and a good stand has been secured with a seeding as late as September 1, but such late seeding is not rec - ommended. Various methods have been tried for preparing the soil previous to seeding into the stubble. In the fall of 1913 one field was divided into three equal plats; No. 1 was double disked and harrowed before seeding; No. 2 was single disked and harrowed; No. :&gt; was seeded without any preparation whatever. All of the alfalfa was seeded with a disk drill, the seed running into the shoe and at the rate of 12 pounds per acre. There was no difference in the stand secured nor in the yield of hay cut during the follow - ing year. In 1!&gt;14 a good stand was again secured by seeding into the stubble without any preparation. This method, especially on the lighter soil, is to be recommended, as it will prevent blowing and drifting during the windy season, and the stubble will also have a tendency to hold the snow during the winter. The drill will do much better work in standing stubble than where it is worked Mown. The disk, unless very sharp, will not cut thru the straw if worked down. IRRKJATIXt; ALFALFA. Kx]K-rimenis with nn late summer and fall irrigation and ■ hi with early spring and late spring irrigations of alfalfa have resulted in no gain for one or the other. It is a common practice to irrigate alfalfa in the spring as soon as water is available. This </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Management of Irrigated Land. is usually at the beginning of the growing season, when the al falfa requires a good irrigation. Should the soil Ik* very dry in the spring when growth In-gins it is well to irrigate. Alfalfa uses considerable water and suffers when irrigation is neglected. Many irrigators prefer to irrigate the crop just before cutting. !&gt;elieving that the water will injure the young growth and the crown if water is applied after the crop is removed. This, however, is not the case unless water is allowed to stand stagnant on the alfalfa. The disadvantages of irrigating previous to cutting are: il i The labor of walking thru the crop and tramping it down: ill uneven spreading of water. Skips cannot Ik- detected, the opera tioii requires more labor, and after the crop is cut the hay will not cure as rapidly on the moist soil as where the land is dry. One of the advantages often mentioned for irrigating previous to cutting is more often a detriment. The contention is that the stubble will start the new growth more quickly if there is an abundance of moisture in the soil. If such a growth is too rapid it often seriously interferes with the hay on the ground: the new shoots growing under the haycocks even to the extent of growing into the hay. CUTTING ALTAI. I- The time of cutting alfalfa makes no material difference as u the total yield obtained during the year, provided the irrigation has lieeu normal. Tests have shown that three cuttings will pro dnoe just as much hay as four cuttings, provided the last ratting is made at the same time in Ixtth cases. Cuttings made at different limes to determine if the yield may l»e increased gave the following results: Taiu.e S. — Rvxultx of alfalfa cutting* made at different Inn determine if tin- yield mat/ !&gt;&lt;■ increased. l):it(.

The difference in the fo&lt;nl value &gt;f the hay cut at different times has not been determined, lull experience has tmght all fujdtili that the finer hay causes less waste in feeding, and more of it is consumed by the animals. This is sufficient cause for cutting it early and often. The quality ■ &gt;f the hav should receive the first consideration. SUGAR BEETS. KEITH OF PLOWING. In 1!I12 work was started in an effort to determine the l&gt;e*t depth of plowing for sugar l&gt;eets. The depths plowed were 4. 8, 12. Hi. and 20 inches. The tirst three de|iths were turned with a common sulky plow; the Hi and 20 inches were plowed 12 inches deep, and a si.lisoil plow was used to obtain the balance of the depth required. The average yield for the three years is shown in Table !*. Table 9. — Average yield of tueer beet* for three fee**. The three years' results do not show any material difference for the various depths of plowing. It would, therefore, not be advisable under average farm conditions to turn alfalfa under as shallow as 4 inches, as the crowns cause too much trouble. Cul - tivation under such conditions is too slow and tedious, and gocd work cannot be done. Results show, however, that plowing from 7 to 9 inches is all that is necessary for our soils, and if stubble ground is used for lieets. even a shallower plowing on the lighter soils will produce equally good results. PLOWING lNIiEH ALFALFA FOR S1CAII BEETS.

The distance of spacing beets has but little influence upon the yield until distances of rows 28 inches apart and beets 12 inehiv - apart in the row are attained. This work was conducted for two years, but as ihe stand of beets in 1912 was not perfect, due to climatic conditions, the re - sults are not comparable, and only the l!H."l results are given in Table 15. There was considerable difficulty in irrigating the beeta t li:ii were 24 and 28 inches apart. As previously stated, the soil ha* but little capacity for carrying the water laterally. As the feeder roots of the beets are along the sides of the beet and do not seein to extend laterally very much, it was necessary to run the water too long to irrigate the crop properly. This was esjtecially true where the rows had too much fall. Several plats were planted with rows alternately IS and 24 inches apart; this would make the rows 21 inches apart on th»' average. The object was to give more space to the horses in the rows and perhaps work the l&gt;eets to better advantage. Only the wide rows were to be ditched, but the same difficulty was encountered as in the wide planting, and in order to irrigate proj&gt;erly the narrow rows had to !k' ditched. lfl-lOM ABLE o. — ir of * uyur bee x wit 'i vanoiix IX anccK of M/xiriiiji Di«tanee of rows Distance plants apart in the row Yield per acre Inehe* 18 18 18 18 20 20 20 20 20 24 24 M 24 24 28 2s 2s 28 28 Inches 6 9 12 15 6 9 12 15 18 ■ • I.' 18 is i; 9 12 Ton* 17.9 17.0 16.8 13.6 19.3 17.1 18.1 is. 4 17.X 16.1 ICO lli.3 Hi.li 156 17.5 15.4 11)7 I 15 IK 13 15 is 1 Hi 14.8 </seg>
