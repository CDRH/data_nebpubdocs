            <seg id="p002">Lincoln, Nebr., Nov. 30, 1912. 'HESTER H. ALDRICH, Governor of Nebraska. Sir : — I have the honor, in compliance with the laws of Nebraska, * to submit herewith the biennial report of the State Food, Drug and Dairy Commission for the hiennium ending Nov. 30, 1912. NIELS P. HANSEN, Deputy Food, Drug and Dairy Commissioner. NEBRASKA FOOD, DRUG AND DAIRY COMMISSION Chester H. Aldrich (Governor) Commissioner W. R. Jackson (deceased) Deputy Commissioner Niels P.

            <seg id="p003">office in January, 1912, to complete the unexpired term of \V. R. Jack - son, deceased. Upon assuming these duties he found the work of the Commission in a most satisfactory condition due to the able manner in which the former Deputy Commissioner had performed his duty. I regret very much that Mr. Jackson was unable to complete the work so well started. Shortly after assuming office, I found that there was much mis - branded foods on sale in the State, as the inspections for February and March of 1912 showed that some 45,000 packages of foods were ordered from sale for non-compliance with the branding clause of the state food law. To get at the source of this difficulty a conference was held with the Jobbers and Manufacturers' Association of the Missouri Valley. At this conference an agreement was reached in which the jobbers agreed to refuse shipments from manufacturers, which were not branded in compliance with the Nebraska Food Law. It was further agreed that all such shipments should be reported to the office of the Food Commission so that the matter might be taken up directly with these manufacturers. It was also agreed by manufacturers of the state that whenever they were placing upon the market any of their products that labels would be submitted to the Commission for rulings as to whether or not they complied with the law. I am pleased to say that from these jobbers and manufacturers, we have received a hearty co-operation. This work if adhered to should in time entirely eliminate misbrapded packages from the field of retail commerce in Nebraska. Drugs. In drugs, I found there were still some old patents which were not labeled for inhibited drugs and in all cases these were ordered off sale and the dealers instructed to notify manufacturers to take up these old goods and replace them with new goods or to furnish new carton properly labeled. The reports from the dealers show that nearly all of these goods 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 have been labeled or replaced by manufacturers, and where the manufacturers had ceased business their goods were ordered destroyed. These orders were complied with without any objections on the part of the druggist*. . Dairy. The inspection of cream stations has l&gt;een rigidly maintained and conditions are gradually improving. The competition in the cream business necessitates the constant inspection and supervision of the cream station operator. Ninety per cent of the complaints received in this office are from this source and are for inaccurate testing of cream. The Commission should be granted the power to revoke a cream tester's licen.se when the evidence shows that manipulation of I has been practiced, The present method of proceedure through the courts is too slow to accomplish the l&gt;est results. The unjust variations in the price of butter fat at the different stations, often only a few miles apart, should receive the serious con - sideration of the next Legislature and a law should lie passed regulat - ing this pernicious practice. Earnest attention has been given to the sanitary conditions of the dairies which supply milk and cream to the various towns in the state. In many cases these were found in a deplorable condition and by pro - secution and assistance of l&gt;oards of health, conditions have been much improved. In all cases where conditions were bad, sanitary orders were served with a five days' notice to make such improvements as were necessary to produce wholesome milk and with few exceptions, the orders were cheerfully complied with, showing that as a rule the law is not willfully violated. The fact that Nebraska is fast becoming a great dairy Mate makes this field of work of vast importance. The Commission has but four dairy inspectors to supervise the many thousands of places where dairy products are produced, and hence cannot give as close inspection as is needed. Stock Food Law, fThe I^egislature of 1911 passed this law, but failed to make any •ropriation for its enforcement. It was found that it would require considerable money to put this law into operation and after consultation with the Attorney General and State Auditor, permiaikm </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 was granted the Commission to use such part of the money collected from the sale of tax tags, etc., as was needed, to enforce the law. The law requires an annual license of $100 from each manufacturer of Condimental Stock Foods and when the law became effective, these manufacturers refu.sed to pay this license and after a hearing by the CooUBMMMV with these parties, an agreement was reached whereby the payment of this license would be held in obeyance, pending the decision by the I'nitcd States Supreme Court, of a case from Iowa, involving the constitutionality of the collection of such a lie This case was decided in favor of the state of Iowa and since then I manufacturers have paid their license of $100 annually. To date we have collected $3,593.55, and have expended for the enforcement of the law $1,419.56, leaving on hand $2,173.99. Pure Seed Law. The Pure Seed I^aw, which is a part of the Stock Food Law, was not enforced, due to the fact that insufficient funds were collected to employ a seed analyst and purchase equipment for a swd lal&gt;oratorv. The department during the winter and spring of 1912 ! corn for viability, for all who submitted sampl' Paint and Oil Law. The paint law has been successfully enforced during the past biennium. However that part of the law pertaining to pure linseed oil is still defective in the penalty clause, the word linseed oil being omitted therein. The former Commissioner called the attention of the Legislature of 1911 to this defect. I recommend that the incoming Legislature so amend the law so as to include linseed oil. This i* very necessary as the state is flooded with adulterated linseed oil as att« to by the large number of samples submitted to the department dur - ing the biennium. Sanitary Law, This law effects all food producing and vending establishments and is the most important work done by the Commission. The qual - ity of foods is always impaired if handled under insanitary conditions and this Department has endeavored to give close attention to the enforcement of this most important law. During the biennium the Department has paid particular attention to the following items in food producing establishments: buildings, ventilation, ceilings, walk </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 and floors, utensils, plumbing, proper washing facilities, proper toilet facilities, exclusion of domestic animals, rodents and insects, pro - hibiting of sleeping in rooms used for manufacturing foods. Health of employees has had close attention and in some instances we have compelled the discharge of diseased employees. Eggs. During the last biennium a large amount of time has been spent in an effort to raise the quality of the Nebraska egg by compelling the dealer to candle his eggs as they are received from the producer. The Nebraska egg,owing to careless methods in handling, has been selling at a discount on the Eastern market. While a large amount of the loss is due to careless handling by the producer, the egg must have proper care after it enters the channels of trade, so a meeting was held in the spring of 1912 with the transportation companies, in which proper methods of transportation were discussed. This resulted in arranging refrigerator car service with the railroads to better accom - modate the egg shipments. The result being a better product and a higher price on the Eastern market. In fact the Nebraska egg now receives as high a quotation as eggs from any other state. State Fair. During this biennium, the Commission has inaugurated and maintained an educational exhibit at the State Fair and great interest was displayed by visitors in the work l&gt;eing done by the department. In connection with this exhibit an egg candling demonstration MM conducted in which eggs were candled for visitors and instruc - tions given for their handling and care. Thousands of bulletins on the proper care and handling of milk and eggs were distributed. The con - tinuation of this demonstration is recommended as an educational feature of the work. In connection with the exhibit, a general inspection of the food and drink emporiums was conducted with a view of eliminating the sale of impure foods and beverages and to improve the sanitary con - ditions under which foods were handled and dispensed. Daily in - spections were made of all the establishments handling foods and drinks and where objectionable products were being handled they were ordered destroyed, many gallons of soft drinks being emptied into the garbage cans. This feature of the work is very essential, </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 owing to the fact that there is a tendency to dispense inferior and unpalatable foods and drinks. Some of the traveling fakers informed us that they would not return to the Nebraska State Fair another The following bulletins have been issued during the biennium: BULLETIN No. 12. Clean Milk. The Dairy Department of this Commission, after making a large numlx&gt;r of sedimentary tests, finds that a large amount of the milk being sold in the cities and larger towns of this state is far from being clean- and sanitary. Only about 4 per cent of all the milk tested was found to lx- of a first -das.- product; 35 per cent was fair and 61 per cent bad. A number were rank and filthy. Fully nine-tenths of all the dirt in milk is cow manure, the re - maining one-tenth consisting of cow hair, dirt from the cow, milkers and barn, particles of hay and straw and germs from diseased i Too many milkers are of the opinion that the manure and dirt dropping from the cow's flank, udder and body into the pail can be strained out of the milk, leaving a clean product. Such is not the case. Much of this dirt goes into solution and passes through the ordinary strainer M easily and quickly as will milk'or water, carrying with it the germs of disease and decay. Still there is much need of Ix-tter straining. A good strainer consists of a cone shaped receptacle with cheese doth and cotton strainer at the outlet. The cotton is placed Ix'tween the layers of gauze and fastened by a tin ring fitting tightly over the rim of the strainer. In this way only enough cotton to cover an K-inch space is required for 100 gallons of milk. This cotton should Ix' burned as soon as used so as to destroy any germs or dirt it may contain. Other requirements for the production of pure milk are as follows: The Stable. Stables should be well ventilated, lighted and drained; should have tight floors, walls and ceiling and be plainly constructed. Sunlight is the cheapest disinfectant. Whitewash the stable once or twice yearly. Kemove litter to field or 50 feet from barn daily. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Cows. Have the herd examined yearly by a skillet! veterinarian and promptly remove from the herd any animal suspected of In'ing in bad health. Never allow the cows to be excited by hard driving, dban, loud talking or unnecessary disturbance; do nut tspoM them to cold or 18. ilK-rally, using only fresh palatable feed stutT&gt;. Provide water in abundance, easy of Mem and aluay- pure; but not too cold. Salt should always be accessible. l)u not 1MB the milk w thin 18 days before and ."&gt; days after calving. Milking. Do not handle litter nor dry, dusty food just previous to milking. ( "lean MM U'fore milking and do not allow any filth to cake upon them. If in any milking a part of the milk is bloody or stringy or unnatural in apiM'arance, the whole mess should lx&gt; rejected. Milk with clean dry hands, never allowing the hands to come in contact with the milk. If any accident occurs by which a pail full or partly full of milk becomes dirty, do not tr&gt;' to remedy this by straining, but reject all this milk and rinse the pail. V Care of Milk. Remove milk from barn promptly and cool immediately. Never close a can containing warm milk which has not aerated, and protect the open can with a cloth or mosquito netting. Never mix fresh, warm milk with that which has been cooled. Do not allow milk to freeze. Under no circumstances should anything be added to milk to prevent its souring. Cleanliness and cold are the only preventives needed. In hot weather cover the cans, when moved in a wagon, with a clean wet blanket or canvas. The Utensils. Milk utensils should be made of metal and have all joints smoothly soldered. Never allow them to become rusty or rough inside. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 Do not haul waste products back to the farm in the same cans used for delivering milk. Clean all dairy utensils by first thoroughly rinsing them in warm water; then clean inside and out with a brush and hot water in which a cleaning material is dissolved; then rinse and lastly sterilize by boil - ing water or steam. Provide the dairy house with a small oil stove and boiler to insure plenty of hot water. After cleaning, keep utensils inverted, in pure air, and in as much sunlight as possible, until wanted for use. Education. The dairyman should sul&gt;scribe for the l)est current dairy litera - ture and secure government and state bulletins on dairying. NIELS P. HAN8EN, Deputy Commissioner. BULLETIN No. 13. Eggs. The importance of the egg industry in Nebraska is not fully appreciated. Statistics show that Nebraska produces 100,000,000 dozens of eggs annually. At an average price of 15 cents per dozen, the value of the egg crop of Nebraska amounts to fifteen million dollars. A loss of two dozen eggs per case would make a total loss to the farmers of the state of 33,000,000 dozen of eggs or $2,240,000. Is it not worth the trouble to use care in handling the eggs on the farm? Cause of Bad Eggs. The loss to the state is enormous and unjustifiable. The primary cause of this loss is with the producer. Some producers deliberately take to market eggs which they know are bad, because they know the merchant is compelled to take them or lose their trade. Another reason is that the producer is ignorant of how to handle and sell eggs. Considerable of the trouble lies with the small merchant who, owing to competition, buys any kind of eggs for fear if he counts out the bad ones he will lose the farmer's trade to his competitor, who will take anything that has a shell around it. When the merchant ships his eggs he must sell them, "rots out," </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 BIENNIAL REPORT ao the price of his goods which the farmer gets in exchange for his eggs must be raised accordingly; the result is that the loss falls on the fanner. A man who deliberately tries to sell bad eggs which he knows are not fresh deserves the extreme penalty of the law, but the one who sells bad eggs through ignorance deserves some information as to the proper methods to use in handling eggs. How to Handle Eggs. When tin' liens on the farm are producing enough eggs to warrant the farmer's taking them to town, arrangements should be made to handle all of them properly. A convenient and clean place should be provided wherein the hens may lay. They should be compelled to lay here in a clean nest. The natural tendency of a hen is to go off in the weeds and make her nest. This should never be i&gt;ennitted and any eggs found in such places should l&gt;e marked and kept at home. It makes no difference how many hens are kept, a house suitable for them should be erected in which they should be compelled to roost and lay. Then if the nests are placed where the hens will not roost on them they can lie kept clean. Straw that is dry makes the best nest - ing material, and if the nest could have a bottom made of one-inch mesh wire it would be self-cleaning. If not . the nesting material should be changed often. If the weather is bad and the hens' feet become muddy, the eggs should lie gathered at least twice daily. This will keep the eggs cleaner. If the weather is hot they should be collected at least twice each day, and oftener if the temperature is very high. This prevents eggs from commencing to decompose, or the germ, in case there is any, to start development. If eggs are laid in barns, sheds, etc., a careful search should be made often, in order to be sun 1 that none are gathered when stale. As soon as the breeding season is over, the male birds should lx&gt; separated from the hens. A male bird is not necessary for the pro - duction of eggs, but is useful only to fertilize the egg, which will be laid in spite of his presence. A fertile egg will commence development, consequently deteriorate, more quickly than will a sterile egg. A fertile egg when freshly laid is supposed to be already started in its development, and if a hen is allowed to stay on it any length of time it will soon be in a condition not to be classed as a fresh egg. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 Keeping the Eggs. When the clean, fresh eggs are gathered they should be put in a clean, dry, cool place until marketed. Even though the place is clean and cool, if it is not dry, molds, etc., will commence development and the eggs will soon spoil. If the eggs become damp and they happen to be in contact with any colored material they will immediately become stained. Good egg cases in a cool, dry, clean place, kept up off of the floor, make an excellent receptacle in which to keep previous to mar- Before these eggs are set aside for market, they should be gone over by the farmer as he collects them, and all small, stained, dirty, doubtful and rotton eggs should be removed. Small and dirty eggs if used immediately, are just as good as large, clean ones, but they will not sell well on the market, and if sent in with good eggs will spoil the trade. Therefore, they should be kept and used at home. No eggs should l&gt;e washed, for the packers claim they will not keep well. All eggs from stolen nests, whose freshness is doubtful, and all in - cubator eggs, should either be thrown away or boiled for the little chicks. They should never be sent to market. Rotten eggs need not be discussed. Any person who will send any to market deserves all the penalty possible from the pure-food law. Marketing the Eggs. When eggs have been properly gathered, handled and kept previous to taking to market, the question of the number of trips to town should be considered. In hot weather the eggs should be mar - keted two to three times per week, and oftener if possible. If that number of trips cannot be made, co-operate with a neighbor and have him alternate days in the trips which must lx? made. In the late fall and spring, eggs should 1k&gt; marketed at least once a week. Many buyers have had trouble in October and Novembet with eggs classed as "held eggs." These are common because most farmers l&gt;elieve that after frost, eggs will not rot so quickly, but nevertheless they do evaporate and the air cells in them show the candler that they are stale. Therefore, the more often eggs are marketed the greater are the chances that they will be good. If the sun beats down hot on the wagon, place a cover of some kind over the cases in order to keep out the unnecessary heat. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Candling. The grades of eggs are mostly determined by candling. This is done by means of some good light, enclosed in a box or metal cylinder, in which are two small openings alongside of each other, to allow the light to pass through. The room in which this is kept is darkened, and the candler ho'.ds to the light in each hand an egg, large end upward, and gives them a quick turn, in order to view the entire contents as it whirls in the shell. To an expert this will quickly reveal the actual condition of the egg, and he will immediately grade and pack it ac- ITo a novice candling is hard to understand, and great has Ix-en the uble in the past when buyers have sent to the farmers the reports their candling. If the loss is great he immediately accuses the ftt of crooked work, and the grading system is a failure. A farmer st fully realize that a large buyer is not going to figure to beat him of a few eggs, for the chance he is running is too great and he could afford the risk. He is an expert in the business, and knows mure •ut what a marketable egg is than does the average seller. I An absolutely fresh egg, when held up l;efore the egg candle, should ■cry clear and only the dim outline of the yolk he visible. There jld !*■ no air cell visible. Any egg other than that is not absolutely h. At the large end a clear space, called the air cell, l)ecomes larger he egg grows older, caused by the evaporation of the water con - : of the egg. If a dark spot is noticed it is either a rot or a develop - germ. A red blood ring is caused by a dead germ. White streaks he shell show that it is cracked. Thus, eggs may be graded by :llihg into fresh, stale, cracked and rotten clas^ Causes of Losses. There are three big dead losses in eggs — losses from cracks, "held" eggs, and "rots." Cracks are usually caused by improper packing, rough roads and handling. The railroads will not pay for the loam unless the eggs are so badly cracked that they become leakers and thus show clear evidence of the railroad's guilt. KHeld " eggs are caused by the great desire of either farmer or small t to wait for an advance in price. This is especially so in the fall p year when the price is apt to rise at any time. BThe third loss, rotten eggs, Ls caused by various things. One big se is the heat of the summer. One hour's direct rays of tin </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 will put an egg out of condition during some of Nebraska's hot wcat her, such as we have during the summer. Another is by the hens stealing - and the eggs not Ix-ing gathered until they are spoiled; this is by carelessness on the part of the fanner. He may gather his eggs from MM to three times per week, then take them to the kitchen, put them behind the stove. U-cause it is the most protected spot, until they are ready to take to town. Thus the eji^s go through a process of heating and cooling, which will surely cause rotting. Regulation and Sale of Eggs. I The sale of rotten or decomposed &lt;ng-; is forbidden under Section 4 of Cobbej*! Annotated Statute:- of Nebraska for 1909. t While the fanner or producer is primarily responsible for the bad p on the market, there are not enough insj&gt;ectors to inspect all eggs they are delivered to market, but the Food, Drug and Dairy In - ■etors are instructed, when possible to inspect eggs when they are ivered to the merchant and report any violation to this ofti' &gt;seeution. However, bad eggs found in th&lt; a of any d I !«■ deemed m sufficient evidence to warrant prosecution. Packing Eggs, t( ■ resit care must l&gt;e used in packing eggs for shipment. Pack both &gt; and iKjttom of cases with excelsior, hay or stray to avoid breakage transit, as poor packing causes many smashed eggs. Do not put cracked e| BULLETIN No. 14. Farmers and Cream Buyers Take Notice. Rules for the Protection and Handling of Cream. Section 9835 of Nebraska Statutes for 1910 provides: "It is hereby made unlawful to use or employ in or aln&gt;ut the keeping or handling of any milk, cream, ice cream or other dairy products to In- used as food any pail, can or other container, churn, separator or other implement, which is in an unclean or unsanitary condition." </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Rule 60 of the Nebraska Food and Dairy Department provides: Milk the cow in a clean manner and in clean surrounding*. Remove the milk as soon as possible from the barn and cool l&gt;efore mixing with that being held for delivery. If possible, cool to 55 degrees and keep at that temperature until delivered. The necessity of removing all animal heat as soon as possible is of vital importance in handling milk and cream. Stir all cream that is being collected for delivery, two or three tin:es a day. Do not hold cYeam longer than four days in cold weather and three days in warm weather. Separate cream to test 35 per cent to 45 per cent, and do not allow it to run below 30 per cent . Rich cream will keep better than thin cream and you save the skimmed milk. Keep cream covered with blankets when delivering to prevent freezing in cold weather or heating in warm weather. Dont's for Cream Buyers. Don't put good and bad cream in same can. Don't use cans or other utensils that are not thoroughly washed and rinsed. Don't allow cream to heat up while in your possession. Keep in cool water or covered with wet blankets. Don't allow cream to stand at depot exposed to sun and heat. Don't haul cream on routes without suitable protection from heat and cold. Don't hurry when you are testing cream NIELS P. HANSEN. Deputy State Food, Drug and Dairy Commissioner. BULLETIN No. 15 Bad Egg Warning ! Section 9824, part sixth, defines food as adulterated, "if it con - sist in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed or putrid animal or vegetable substance." </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 This Includes Bad Eggs. Kt is unlawful for the farmer, merchant, or other dealer to sell or for sale bad eggs. Bit is unlawful for the merchant to sell bad eggs to his patron* or to dealers. ■The sale of eggs "ca&lt;e count" concedes the sale of rotten eggs, ami , violation of the law. Warning is hereby given that any person found selling bad eggs will be prosecuted by this Department. The State Inspectors of the Food Commission are instructed to enforce these provisions of the law \ Penalty. Section 9840, (as amended 1911). "Any person violating any provision of this act shall upon conviction thereof be fined in a sum of not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00 at the discretion of the court, and shall pay the costs of prosecution and stand committed to the county jail until said fine and costs are paid." ITo avoid penalties under the above law, dealers are required to die all eggs purchased. Suggestions for Fanners. Provide plenty of clean, dry nests for your hens. Gather the eggs daily in cool weather and twice a day in hot or rainy weather. Do not wash eggs. Use dirty and small eggs at home. Keep your eggs in a cool, dry place, which is free from odors. Don't sell eggs which have been in an incubator. Market your eggs daily if possible; if not, every other day. Don't sell eggs which were found in a stolen nest. Keep the eggs out of the sun when taking them to town. Don't keep eggs near oil, onions, etc., as they readily absorb I The egg crop of Nebraska had an annual value of $19,576,212 in 0, or equal in value to the combined hog and potato production I $5,000,000 more than the alfalfa crop. Kf, as claimed, Nebraska eggs bring 5 cents less per dozen on the tern market, owing to their low quality, by proper care in handling egg crop, Nebraska could add to her wealth $5,000,000 annually. </seg>

HON. NIELS P. HANSEN, Deputy Food, Drug and Dairy Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebr. Sir: I herewith submit to you the report of Chemist of the .State Food, Drug and Dairy Commission for the biennium ending November 30, 1912. During the last biennium a large number of analyses have Ix-cn made in the laboratory, however there has not been a systematic investigation of foods and drugs offered for sale in the state, owing to the lack of help in the laboratory. Under the present conditions I am kept busy analyzing samples of foods and drugs submitted by the people of the state and samples collected Ijy the inspectors. To keep a satisfactory check on the foods and drugs being offered for sale in the state, each line of products should be examined in the laboratory for purity and branding. This would involve large amount of chemical work and would require the entire time of one analyst. The various states which are doing effective work along these lines have from three to six chemists in their laborat who are kept busy the whole time keeping in touch with the composi- tion of the foods and drugs being offered for sale. During the biennium a large number of samples of linseed oil have been sent to the laboratory for analysis by various dealers throughout the state and as in the preceding biennium, most of them were found to be adulterated. This is a bad condition and is due to the fact that the linsed oil law is defective and the department is unable to prosecute in such cases. The principal adulterators of linseed oil carry on their nefarious business within the borders of the state and this Coniinission receives many complaints from Commissions in the bordering states for permitting these conditions. During the past biennium the following analyses have been made: Sai Vlilk and cream ce cream D aints and oils *» * ua ■ vr»»« I </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Drugs 11 In addition to these, samples of soap 15 Lubricating oils 12 were analyzed for the State Board of Purchase &amp; Supplies. Several sample* of petroleum oils were also analyzed for the State Oil Com- mission. I tind that the use of injurious preservatives in food product is practically a thing of the past, however the temptation to misbrand product.* as to their quality and composition is still strong and needs constant investigation on the part of the Commission. Analysis of the canning con pounds being offered for sale on the market shows that they are co.vposed principally of boric a -id. an injurious chemical whose use in foods is forbidden by the National law. These are sold to the innocent housewife under some trade name and she prepares all of her canned fruit and vegetables with large quantities of this drug. The result is that her family is served with food at even- meal which contains large doses of this injurious preservative. The Legis'ature should so amend the state law as to forbid the sale of this class of products when they contain injurious chemicals. The Stock Food law passed by the last Legislature, to be fully effective will require the analysis of the various stock fo&lt;xls being sold on the market, for without this analysis the manu acturer, although he has a sealed sample and an affidavit of its analysis, filed in the office. could continue to sell an adulterated food without fear of Ix-ing de- Respectfully submitted. E. L. REDFERN. HON k NIELS P. HANSEN Deputy Food, Drug and Dairy Commissioner Lincoln. Nebr. Sir: Following is a report of my work as dairy inspector for the biennium ending Noveml&gt;er 30, 1912 During the 21 mont&lt;hs with this department I have inspected approximately as follows: ( 'ream stations 1012 Creameries 78 Dairies, (including milk depots, wagons, etc.) 565 </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 I have issued over 400 written orders on sanitation and secured twenty-six convictions for prosecution. 1 have spent several periods of one week in length in various cream- eries checking the testing and inspecting the quality of ereafh as received by the stations and have devoted considerable time to educa - tional work at farmers institute meetings, etc., advocating the im - proving of farm dairies in general. This latter phase of work special attention as the original source of our dairy products, generally sjx'aking, is in need of better equipment and the employment of more sanitary methods. Farm Dairies. I have found farm dairies that are very improperly conducted. Frequently the cows are compelled to wade through knee-deep man - ure in entering the stables and there, are forced to exist under similar conditions. Some of these barns have no floors nor gutters, no win - dows for light or ventilation and the walls and dilapidated ceilings are thickly covered with dirt and cob-webs. The milk is frequently stored and handled in the places likewise used for the storing of fuel, farm tools, etc.. causing very insanitary surroundings. Filthy methods in milking and caring for milk in general are employed, and buckets, cans, separators and other utensils show evidence of negligence in cleaning. • It is gratifying to note that great improvements along these lines have l&gt;een made and I find that the average farmer is willing to comply with such demands if same are properly presented. Sediment Tests and Adulterations. I have had occasion to make many so called sedimentan of milk and cream being retailed in the larger towns and judging from a comparison of previous and recent tests, am pleased to report some very satisfactory improvements. 'onfeetioneries (including ice cream pi Slaughter houses Meat markets Hotels and restaurants u&lt; naiii" 1 . f u ._/ ;tcf ants. &lt;■' :c. 86 Total inspections 2,860 </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 In connection with this it is my duty to report that some adultera - tions in milk and cream are still to be found. A recent investigation in Omaha proves the necessity of a strict enforcement of the law governing such violations. Cream Stations. I am pleased to report a gradual improvement of the cream receiving stations in regard to their sanitary conditions and otherwise. Inaccurate test scales and bottles have practically t&gt;een abandoned and the standard of accuracy in work on the part of operators is lx»ing raised. I find that the majority of the complaints filed against these op - erators is caused by the keen competition in the business. ( )ften they are falsely accused of improper testing by their patrons. Many com - plaints of cream-test variation can be traced back directly to the separation of cream on the farm; being caused by variations in rich - ness of milk, speed and cleanliness of separators, rate of inflow, tem - perature of milk, addition of flush water, adjustment of cream screw, etc. The operators found manipulating tests have ben dealt with according to law by this Commission. The cream delivered at these stations is often of a very inferior quality. One woman could not understand how it happened that her cream contained such an abundance of flies, as she had fished out nearly a quart of them before bringing it to town. The large per - centage of poor grade cream, however, is caused through ignorance on the part of the farmer regarding the proper way of producing and caring for it. There is gread need for more educational work along these lines. Slaughter Houses and Meat Markets. 1 have found slaughter houses and meat markets in very deplorable conditions. In some instances the o.Tal had accumulated to a depth of several feet near the slaughter house proper, this mess being alive with worms and delivering an undescribable odor. With doors and windows offering no protection, the flies had full access to the meat while being prepared for market, as well as to the refuse outside. ( 'onditions found in some of the meat markets are at times subject to much criticism and earnest work accompanied by several prosecu - tions have brought alwut many very desirable changes. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">23 Eggs. Kin my estimation, probably no line of work conducted by th s nmission has been more effective than the enforcement of a law forbidding the sale of bad eggs. The farmer now is much rrore careful regarding the care and hand - ling of the eggs he brings to town because he knows that he MB pay only for good eggs and the merchant also does not look at the egg candling process as an imposed hardship after familiarizing himself with this work and learning its financial advanta^* Miscellaneous. During my course of inspections I have frequently had occasion to investigate along lines not directly connected with dairy work, in evidence of which I might mention the prosecution of a miller for short weighing his flour and eed and bringing to justice a cider manu - facturer for the making of cider under very unsanitary conditions. In summarizing this report, I wish to state that I find by far the majority of fanners, merchants, etc.. to lie law-abiding citizens who strive to do what is right and I believe that the work of this ('unmiis - sion should continue to l&gt;e conducted in the spirit of an educational campaign, using good tact, judgment and diplomacy in the enforce - ment of the food, drug and dairy laws.

Sir: As there is but one month of the present commission remaining, will try to give you as true accounting of my work as I possibly can. There are about 350 cream stations in my territory; have been to see them all during the year we are closing. Some of them I have inspected four times, a few of them but once. When I started Jan - uary, 191 1, 1 found at least 30 per cent of the stations in an insanitary condition, some in butcher shops, one in a shoe cobbler's shop and ral in basements of grocery stores. This has been done away with </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 during your administration. The 350 cream stations in my territory show a marked improvement. I have made 375 tests on milk in the different towns out~ Douglas County, and found very few Mow standard. I have given special attention to the sedimentary tests and considiT it one of the most effective methods used by the ( 'onimission. When 1 started out I found cans lying around depots and scat t«ri-&lt;l around cream stations: any number of cans being used to haul and cans ixMiig loaned for different purposes. The law has l&gt;een strictly enforced and these conditions have ixM-n changed. Must stations have built racks for their cans and given attention to the removal of the lids of cans when stacked up inside the buildings. A marked improvement is very evident in the condition of eggs, and few bad eggs now can be found on the market. I have given instructions and helped to construct over 200 egg candlers during the pa.»t year. I have inspected several dairy herds and a number of dairies where milk is produced, and where insanitary conditions were such as to warrant it, have issued sanitary orders, all of which have l&gt;een readily complied with.

Sir: During my service as an inspector, I had but, two law suits. &lt; )nc resulted in a conviction and the other failed because of the death of the main witness. With rarely an exception. I found the business men of all classes anxious to comply with the food law, but at the same time few were familiar with the law and rulings. I therefore avoided law suits where results could be otherwise obtained. The candling of eggs was a big undertaking, but it ha* been so well rstablished, it will tie a comparatively easy matter hereafter to main - tain. Very truly. R. S. BCOFIELO, Food and Drug bmpmkm.

This work occu - pied alxjut two months, with occasional interruptions for special inspections in the field. I then spent a short time in general inspection work, but was re - called to the office owing to the illness of Deputy Commissioner Jack - son, put in charge of the publishing and proofreading of the Nebraska Food, Drug and Dairy Laws in pamphlet form and directed to assist in the general work of the office. I was thus employed until temporary return of Mr. Jackson to the office when I again took up field work. So much of my time being occupied with office work which from its nature cannot be tabulated, the record of my work in number of in - spections for the year 1911 is small. During the year of 1912, I inspected in about 85 towns, some of which were visited more than once. The inspections in these towns were general, including all food producing and dispensing establish - ments. Thirteen canning factories were inspected during the months of August and"Septenil&gt;er. In some it has l&gt;een special cases, working on complaints, etc During the State Fair of 1912, I inspected 85 restaurants, lunch stands and soft drink stands on the Fair Grounds, some of them several times and rendered a summarized report of the conditions. The territory assigned to me at the beginning of the biennium was the Chicago and Northwestern K. R. and its northern branches, in - cluding the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Ry. Also the branches of the B. &amp; If. R. R. in the northeastern part of the state. This territory is the seat of at least two hundred towns, nearly all of which should know by actual inspection that there are state food and sanitary laws to insure them gixxl clean foods. I have l&gt;een able in this biennium to insect only a little over half of these. Some of the larger ones have bmm visited a second time; some inland towns have never l&gt;een inspected. The railroad facilities in the western part make it difficult and ex - pensive to reach a numl&gt;er of them, but this section seems especially to consider it their right to have an inspector visit them occasionally and let them know what the law requires of them, and how to comply with it ; there is much vague speculation everywhere concerning </seg>
            <seg id="p027">27 In performing the duties above set forth, I have traveled 12,000 miles. In the enforcement of the sanitary law I have issued 112 written orders and a good many hundred verbal orders and suggestion.-. I am pleased to state that compliance with both the food laws and the sanitary laws concerning the buildings in which the foods are kept is much more general than when the sanitary law was first passed by the legislature of four years ago, and a continuous enforcement of t laws should soon make Nebraska's standard very high. The advance has l&gt;een specially marked during the past biennium. Respectfully submitted, HARRIET S. MacMURPHY. Food and Drug Inspector. Lincoln, Nebr., December 6, 1912 MR. N. P. HAN8EN, Deputy Food, Drug and Dairy (.'nimmssioner Lincoln, Nebr. SDear Sir: The following is a brief statement of my work from ay 1, 1911, to December 6, 1912. I have made nineteen hundred eighty-one (1981) inspections of various lines, with the results summarized below. Inspections. Bakeries 148 Barber supplies and jobbers 9 Bottling works 37 Total number of inspections 1,981 159 Sanitary orders issued. Amount of goods ordered out of sale, 353,218 pieces.

            <seg id="p028">■ In 1911, after an inspection of thirty flour mills, seventeen cars were taken off of sale for short weight, and ordered re-sacked. The amount of deficient goods taken off of sale for various causes such as short weights, unmerchantable and sanitary conditions, and failure to cite the weight, measure or component parts, amounted to 353,218 pieces, which is equal to 9,868 cases, or about twenty care of Included in the above total were some eleven thousand pieces of swells, shelf-worn, and unmerchantable goods. Of the nineteen hundred eighty-one inspections only thirty-six passed without having to take out of sale goods that did not comply with the law, and only fifty passed all grades of inspection. Sanitary Conditions. While I have only issued one hundred fifty-four written orders for general clean up. and necessary repairs, I have made twice as many verbal requests to the same effect, which requests were complied with in all cases. It was not uncommon to find the ceiling and walls of the work rooms of meat markets and bakeries in bad condition, black and dirty. As a rule, however, as soon as these various merchants saw what the sanitary law requirements were, they would get busy at oner and make their places of business comply with such requirements. Buildings. The buildings and rooms in which a great many markets, bakeries and restaurants are conducted have l&gt;een found to be in a had con - dition, and unsanitary, in fact not fit places in which to prepare food and the proprietors of the various business concerns have not been able to compel the landlord to make the necessary repairs so that the shops could be kept in a merchantable and sanitary condition. The Commission has been of assistance to perhaps fifty or more of t 1 tenants in securing the needed repairs. Out of nineteen hundred eighty-one inspections that I have made together with all requests for better improvement) nineteen hundred teventu-Jive business firms have l&gt;ecome friends and supporters of our ( 'ommission.

            <seg id="p029">29 HOX. N. P. HANSEN, Deputy Food, Drug and Dairy Commissioner, Lincoln, Ncbr. fDear Sir: I hand you herewith my report as Dairy Inspector for e Northwest District of Nebraska for the biennium 1911-12, the hmptt&amp;km dealing for the most part with the locally produced food products, milk, cream, butter, eggs and meats and the sanitary con - ditions under which such pnxlucts are produced. Milk. The condition of damn in the district is on the whole very good, there having l&gt;een little or no complaint with the exception of tin - larger cities and in these I have found no difficulty in securing prompt and proper response to such suggestions and sanitary orders as I Emade from time to time during the two years. Being so lari: and grazing territory, there has l&gt;een much less occasion for in - ions of the food laws with reference to milk production and - n than would naturally arise in territory containing the larger cities. My observation is that dairymen who produce the entire pro - duct which they sell, are very solicitious that it come up to the pr standard of butter fat and in eases where a portion of their supply is purchased, frequent tests of such milk insures its complying with the required standard. While the equipment of many dairies in the district might be very much better with an increased expenditure the methods on the whole are very satisfactory. Cream. In the matter of cream production, there has been some improve - ment, through a considerable volume of poor quality cream has been poured into the creameries, in spite of all-efforts made to improve it. Many cream producers are faulty in their methods of storing cream on the farms and during the hot season of the year which is also a very busy season, cream is delayed in delivery to the stations until it is in many cases totally unfit for use, and notwithstanding the fact that the creameries through their road representatives and the operators of cream stations together with the state inspectors, have done what they could to remedy the situation, it must be admitted that they have been only partially successful in their efforts. Some localities are very much worse in this respect than others and if the inspectors had </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 the time to visit the cream producers in localities that are habitually faulty in this respect and make suggestions in such individual cases as they find necessary, in my judgment a vast improvement might reasonably be expected. I find that station operators are very much more careful in their testing work and that there is on the whole a very grat ifying improvement in the sanitary condition of stations. tRule 59, promulgated by the Pure Food Commission and made ctive July 1, 1911, did accomplish a large amount of good in the matter of eliminating inaccurate testing in stations, as it insured the oprators more time for their testing work, and had it not been annulled by the courts I think that most of the complaints on cream station testing might have l&gt;een avoided and while the rule might be modified somewhat as to time of payment for cream, it contains in my judgment the provision Tor doing the day's testing at the close of business, which I Ix'lieve to \ie essential to perfect work in making tests of cream in the stations. Eggs. The work of the dairy inspectors in the matter of milk and cream insjK'ction lias been necessarily shortened during the past two years, because of the large amount of attention which has been required for the egg business. Unfortunately the time of the year when milk ami cream conditions are the worst, is also the time when the most atten - tion is necessary to the answering of complaints arising from the egg business, and considering the advancement which has Ix-en made in this important department of the work of the inspector, I feel that there is substantial cause for satisfaction. A number of co-operating causes have brought alxnjt this improved situation, one of which is the diligent attention given by the Food Department to supplying even- egg dealer with bulletins prepared by the department and the careful posting of these in business houses where eggs are l&gt;ought. and the fact that dealers have co-operated with the Department in calling careful attention to these bulletins and their requirements, has in my judgment done a vast amount of good. Producers and dealers in eggs are now generally well posted in the requirements of the law and the results of non-compliance with the same. In addition to this the in- Rpeetors have acted as instructors in cases where instruction was necessary, even to the extent of making home-made candling devices for dealers who were not familiar with the process of egg candling. Merchants and others dealing in eggs have been very attentive to the </seg>
            <seg id="p031">31 information given by the inspectors and for the most part have evinced a ready willingness to comply with all requirements. It is true that there have been large losses in the egg business, due largely to the latitude covered in the purchase and handling of No. 2 eggs, I have taken particular pains to advise egg dealers that it is this kind of pro - duct in which substantially all of their losses come in the egg business. The passing of total rots through the channels of business has been practically eliminated and with the closer attention to the matter of turning back No. 2 eggs, which is being given, I am satisfied that there will lie fewer losses in the egg business, a higher standard in eggs and a consequent better price comparatively as the closer attention ha&lt; time to effect these improvements. Meats In no department of the work of food inspection has there been more improvement than 'n the inspection of meats, and the condition of meat markets and slaughter places. Most of the business men engaged in the preparation and sale of meats, are thoroughly alive to the fact that unceasing vigilance is necessary if an absolutely sanitary product is to be furnished to the public and for the i part, very little correction has been necessary. However in the cases of men younger in the business, the visits of the inspector are very helpful and as a rule they have been very attentive to the instruction given. One very bad feature of the meat industry is the fact that numerous businesses of this kind over the district are conducted in rented buildings, where the dealers do not feel it incumbent upon them to keep up such repairs as are necessary to a strictly sanitary point and where the owners of the buildings are apparently chiefly inter, in securing the monthly rental with as little outlay as possible. Most of the bad conditions which present themselves in the I industry arise from the fact that old and unfit buildings are used for the business and in the worst cases I find that these are rented buildings where it is difficult to secure the necessary improve!) In some few cases it has l&gt;een necessary to close the doors of such sin pps and slaughter places, but this is an extreme to which inspectors natur - ally hesitate to go and hence only the very worst cases have been subjected to such handling. The issuing of clean up orders in the case of insanitary meat markets and slaughter houses has usually had the effect of producing the improvements most needed. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 Sanitation. On the final round of the district, I am able to report a very much improved sanitary condition in those places of business where inspec - tions are required. In this matter the most gratifying feature is the fact that the requirements of the food laws are now observed, so far as my investigation goes, with as much alacrity sis any other part of the statutes. For the most part there is a prompt resjxmse to sanitary orders and the diligence which has Ijeen shown by inspectors in pro - secuting habitual offenders in this respect, has had a most wholesome effect, though the nuinl&gt;er of prosecutions for running insanitary business places has bm few in this district. Prosecutions. t While the number of prosecutions in this district has not Ix-en ;e during the two years. I feel that it has Ix-en applied in those here it was actually justice and no attempt has l&gt;een made to advertise the Food Department by a course of wholesale prosecution. In the seven cases in which prosecutions have bwa commenced, fines have Iteen recovered in six, and the other was lost not l&gt;ecause of insufficient evidence, but on a point of law. I have felt during the two years that 1 have served in this important work, that instruction is of more value than prosecution and that most men are willing to comply with the law, when they fully understand what the law requires, and to that end I have l&gt;een more attentive to the matter of giving what I considered needful information first and the matter of punishing offenses has l&gt;een secondary. Very respectfully submitted, ROBERT G. DOUGLAS, Dairy Inspector. X. P. E.V Deputy Food, Drug and Dairy Commissioner, Lincoln. Nebr. Dear Sir : During a period of one year and five months, I have made 2,194 inspections, served 493 written sanitary orders and several hundred oral sanitary orders, 330 removal orders (during last year), 71 , 133 pieces ordered off sale (during last year), 29 prosecutions in 191 1 and 4 prosecutions in 1912. I feel that this year's inspection in almost every case showed a marked improvement in sanitary conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">33 Slaughter Houses. A great majority of slaughter houses over the state were built of rough lumber with wide unbattened cracks in the ceiling, sides and floors, filthy walls, rat-eaten near the floors, floors half cleaned and partly taken up with a pile of carelessly salted, dirty hides lying there weeks, waiting for the buyer. Clothing used while butchering was frequently found so stiff with dried blood and dirt that, independent of a nail for support, would fairly stand alone. Saws and knives were often left unwashed. The light and ventilation in nine cases out of ten was only to be had by leaving the door open to every dust laden zephyr, and welcoming with its odors, flies innumerable. Pools of blood underneath the building, piles of decaying offal lying barely outside the door, were the immediate surroundings of all too many slaughter houses, while in many of the adjacent yards lay half picked bones and odoriferous carcasses of animals that had died before the time set for their butchering or of animals dragged out there from town at night by some innocent-minded man who thought it a convenient dump. I have pictures of every condition mentioned that I have taken on the grounds while making these inspections. The pollution of small streams was inevitable when they were lined with many such yards of decaying carcasses and putrid, unburned or un - buried offal. Prosecutions and sanitary orders are rapidly correcting these extreme conditions. We mention these a* extreme cases because there has always been a percentage of butchers who have always shown a realization of sanitary conditions and have tried hard to maintain them voluntarily. Over the state where it has been possible for us to make such in - spections there are appearing structures that are a credit to those engaged in this line of business; well lighted, ventilated, drained, screened, lime washed, with offal disposed of before it can become putrid. Great progress has been made but there is still great room for improvement in many pin Meat Markets. These on the whole were in far better average condition. Quite a number of markets were found with dirty hooks or racks in other - wise clean refrigerators. Carelessly cleaned meat grinders or stuffers </seg>

Meat kept too long was usually given a dose of kerosene as preliminary. Watered oysters or meats doctored with sulphites are not often found. The exceptions have been dealt with accordingly. Groceries. During the last year I have kept tab on the pieces of misbranded goods I have ordered off sale in regular inspections and find the total exceeding seventy-one thousand pieces. These goods were ordered off sale to be rectified by the party re - sponsible and where prosecutions were ordered, that was attended to. The manufacturers and jobbers had been very negligent in this matter as well as in putting out goods illegibly stamped or printed. Cleaner stores, the protecting of goods from flies and dust and ob - jectionable odors and the guarding against the sale of unfit foods occupied our chief attention here. Swells and Flippers. I was detailed on a special investigation of this pha.se of the canned goods business and found among the things learned, these chief items: The so called sanitary can was giving the chief trouble. Most managers of canned goods departments expressed the opinion that it was chiefly brought about by overfilling, imperfect exhaustion or heat. Berries with considerable acid or pitted fruits seemed the lines giving most Inrther. They say that the flipper is perfectly good in practically all cases and that storage in a refrigerator will in nearly all cases restore the can to its normal appearance. The swells are admittedly spoiled. Samples have been sent to the Chemist and analyzed and the matter is still being closely watched. I have found single groceries with as high as seventy-six cases of flippers that they have purchased from peddlers who have in turn purchased them from the jobbers at a bargain price. We have destroyed spoiled canned goods that were still left on sale in a number of places. Extracts. Thousands of Ixrttles of extracts have been put off sale until the percent of alcohol, the net content, and artificial color or flavor present, are clearly printed on the label. A great amount of worthless </seg>
            <seg id="p035">DEPUTY FOOD COMMISSIONER 35 old stuff that was falsely labeled and without strength has been voluntarily destroyed by grocers after it had been condemned. In many of these cases the firms which had manufactured the so called extracts had gone out of business years ago. Extract stocks have been gone over quite thoroughly and are in good condition. Lard. As late as the eleventh of July after the Supreme Court's decision had been handed down, I found large consignments of lard yet un - branded for the net weight. Only one or two of the companies were complying with the law. Off sale orders and prosecutions have pretty well remedied this. Net Weight. There seems to be quite a unanimity of feeling among jobbers that the net weight could just as well be required by law on all pack - age goods instead of simply on the ones now specified and many packages not requiring net weight label bear it anyway. Occasionally we find a package with the color of the background of such color as to render the net weight illegible. This is being strongly opposed as it clearly violates the law and really makes void the result to be attained by such a law. Bakeries The tone of bakery sanitation is rapidly rising and the quality of the product is not to be compared to the bread of ten years ago, it is so much better. With so important a food we should greatly ap - preciate the improvement. These notes cover a part of the field though of course not all of it. Respectfully submitted, E. C.
