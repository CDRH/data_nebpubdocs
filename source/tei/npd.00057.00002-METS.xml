            <seg id="p002"/>
            <seg id="p003">FOREWORD To His Excellency, the Governor : The Board of Control herewith transmits the Fifth Biennial Report of the State Institutions of Nebraska for the period ending June 30, 1923. The biennium formerly ended on November 30 of each even-numbered year, but this date was changed by an act of the legislature, so that this report really covers a period of thirty-one months from December 1, 1920, to June 30, 1923. During the period, no change has occurred in the personnel of the Board, but several changes have been made in the chief officers of institutions. Dr. Beverly A. Finkle, superintendent of the Orthopedic Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska, resigned to enter private practice, and was succeeded on August 23, 1921, by Dr. J. H. Matthai. Miss Amy V. Stevens, who had been superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln, Nebraska, for a number of years, resigned on July 5, 1922, being succeeded by her sister, Miss Nellie Stevens. The latter served until February 19, 1923, when her resignation was received, and Miss Lena Driever was appointed to the position. We call attention with pride and pleasure to the fact that the report shows the institutions to have gone through the bien - nium without incurring any deficiencies; although the cost of living, and consequently the cost of supporting the state's depen - dents, has certainly not decreased since the appropriations were made for the biennium. Some improvements of a pcrmament character have been made at the various institutions during the period covered by this report. A hospital building, bakery and scullery have been erected at the Nebraska Institution for Feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebraska ; a cottage for girls at the Girls' Training School, Geneva, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Burkett, </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska ; a gymnasium building at the State Industrial School, Kearney, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, Nebraska ; a farm house and a barn at the Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska; a warehouse at the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford, Nebraska ; a kitchen building at the Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk, Nebraska ; a main building at the State Reformatory for Women, York, Nebraska. These buildings were badly needed, and they will have to be followed by others in the very near future if our wards are to be properly, efficiently and economically cared for. The legislature just past made provision for two or three buildings, but failed to see the necessity for several others that were urgently requested. Brief mention was made in the last report of the establishment of the Reformatory for Men at Lincoln, but the importance of the institution calls, we believe, for rather more extended notice. This institution was established as a result, primarily, of a wide recognition of the need of segregating young first-term offenders from more mature criminals. The legislature of 1921 authorized the establishment, therefore, of such an institution, making an initial approproation of $300,000. Of this sum the Board ex - pended $37,500 for 10 acres and a brick building known as the Hay ward Military Academy, later buying about 152 acres of contiguous land for the sum of $49,531.25. This land is used for farming, stock raising, dairying, and intensive gardening. Various trades are taught such as tailoring, shoe repairing, carpentry and joinery, brick laying, electricity, automobile repairing, launder - ing, engineering, firing, and barbering. The manual labor about the institution is, of course, performed by the inmates, of which there are at this date 189. Mr. A. W. Miller, the superintendent, is doing much constructive work with the young men committed to his charge, and we believe the institution is amply justifying itself. The difficulty of employing the penitentiary inmates at suitable labor that does not conflict too much with the prerogatives of the free workers of our state, has been pretty well overcome. The state still operates the fibre furniture factory which has been at the prison for some years, and has also established relations with the Oberman Company by which shirts are made and disposed of with a minimum of competition with free labor. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">INMATE POPULATION There are seventeen institutions under the control of the Board, and at this time (July 1, l c &gt;23&gt; the inmate population is 5917, as compared with an average of 4980 for the biennium ending in 1921, and 4907 fur the biennium just prior to that.

            <seg id="p007">7 Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln — At its various institutions the state owns something over 4000 acres of land, of which in excess of 3500 are in farm and garden. About 800 acres are rented in addition. Details of operation are given in the reports from the several superintendents which are appended hereto. The health of the inmate population has been generally good during the past biennium. We are pleased to be able to report that no epidemic has broken out at any of the institutions, and our medical men have been able to cope with such sporadic cases of contagious disease as have appeared. In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation of the efforts of the officers and employees of the various institutions in striving to bring about a betterment of the living conditions of the wards under their care. We wish also to thank the Governor for his manifestations of interest and for his assistance in the work of this department, and we trust that he will continue his efforts to help us provide better means of caring for the wards of the state.

            <seg id="p019">A To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I herewith present the report of the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children for the period ending June 30, 1923. At the close of the biennium we have ninety-one children in the Home, seven in other institutions, and three hundred and two in trial homes. Quite a number of these will be legally adopted. We feel we have been very fortunate during the past year in placing our children in good homes. They are visited regularly by our field agent, who has been with us for some time and is most efficient in the work. Special care is taken that both the child and the foster parents are perfectly satisfied before the adoption papers are issued. A child, during this trial period of four months, may be brought back to the Home if either the people or the child be - come dissatisfied. Dependency implies many things besides lack of means of support. Parents who are able to furnish their children with the necessities of life are often unfit to provide the elements essential to their physical, mental or moral growth. Therefore we receive many children whose parents or other relatives are able to provide for and support them, but who in spirit or character or morality are unsuited to have them under their control. The health of the children has been exceptionally good. The most severe epidemics were the whooping cough, influenza, and mumps. These have been rather difficult to take care of, due to the inconvenience of the isolation room, but patience and perse - verance by those who worked with it finally won through. The Home needs a cottage for either isolation or first and second nursery, preferably the nursery. If this could not be had for a time, perhaps the large store-room or attic could be made into a dormitory. The health and welfare of our babies are greatly handicapped because of the inadequate means of sterilization, only one small electric plate "being provided for the work in the nursery. 857563 </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 The want of a manual training department is felt. We always have a number of girls and boys here who should be taught industry, but having no employment for them they show no ambition for work. This makes it a little hard to place children from the age of seven to twelve years, and often the children lose a good home or opportunity on account of this. I wish to say, with the few things our boys and girls have to do, we have been most fortunate, although if they had more employment our work would be much better. At this time I desire to give full credit to my faithful, efficient employees, who have so conscientiously assisted me in the care and training of the children intrusted to us. I wish to express my appreciation of our kind neighbors : Dr. Matthai, our physician, and his nurses who have so faithfully cared for our children ; Warden Fenton, who has not forgotten us during this summer, sending at different times vegetables, enough for the employees and the children ; Mr. Miller, too, who has shown us many kind favors. I feel especially grateful to the Board of Control of State Institutions for the kind consideration and help given us in our new work. Respectfully LENA DRIEVER, Superintendent. </seg>
