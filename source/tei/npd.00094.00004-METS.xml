B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., for authority to discontinue the operation of passenger motor trains Nos. 97 and 98, between Beatrice and Holdrege, is again before the Commission for consideration. The application was filed December 11, 1939, and was set for public hearing at Hastings on January 5 and 6, 1940. After an extensive hearing, including many witnesses pro and con, statistical exhibits, arguments and briefs of counsel, the Commission entered its order under date of April 6, 1940, in -which said application was denied. Upon the overruling of applicant's motion for a rehearing, an appeal was properly perfected to the Supreme Court of Nebraska. The Su - preme Court, after hearing oral arguments, rendered its opinion under date of December 20, 1940 in which it reversed the Commission's order. No further action was taken by protestants within the time allowed for a motion for reargument. The mandate of the Supreme Court was entered on January 31, 1941, remanding the case to the Commission for further proceedings, in the following words: "This cause coming on to be heard upon appeal from the Nebraska State Railway Commission, was argued by counsel and submitted to the court; upon due consideration whereof, the court finds error appar - ent in the record of the proceedings and judgment of said Railway Commission in its final order denying applicant permission to discon - tinue trains No. 07 and 98, in that it is based on findings without sup - port in the evidence and is therefore unreasonable and arbitrary. It is, therefore, considered, ordered and adjudged that said judgment of the Nebraska State Railway Commission be, and hereby is, reversed and cause is remanded for further proceedings according to law; that appellant recover of and from appellees its costs incurred herein, taxed at $98.60; for all of which execution is hereby awarded, and that a man - date issue accordingly." In the body of the Opinion, among other things, the Court said: •See pages 80 and 114 of 1940 Annual Report. </seg>
         <seg id="p059">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "Testimony of the character indicated by the foregoing summary •was multiplied by witnesses opposing the application, but notwith - standing such testimony and all evidential facts in the record, trains 97 and 98, operated as passenger trains, are practically obsolete. Income from passenger traffic, averaging less than two passengers per'train mile, is out of all proportion to the •cost of operation as shown by uncontradicted evidence. There is no public necessity for ex - clusive passenger trains operated as such without compensate revenue nor is there any competent probative evidence of a material increase. Witnesses generally came to the hearing before the commission in pri - vate automobiles. They were prompted by natural impulses to do so. They preferred a convenient, speedy and comfortable way to travel on highways constructed and improved at public expense. They started from their own doors. They were not hampered by railroad time tables or limited in speed by motor trains or delayed by stops at sta - tions. It is expecting too much of human nature, of optimism, of forecasts for moisture, and of proper attitude toward the railroad com - pany, to find that trains 97 and 98&gt; ifcontinued, will be substituted for automobiles on the transportation of passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege. Conditions of railroad transportation have changed since 1886, when this branch line was constructed, and the revenues during the entire intervening period are not proper measures of earnings and expenses under present changed conditions. : Earnings and expenses since 1932, a period suggested by remonstrants for com - putations, are not proper measures of present or future profits and losses. Applicant must reckon with conditions resulting in present losses. The slight decrease in the loss occasioned by the operation of the mo - tor passenger trains in 1939 was due in part to dismissal of one member of a train crew. Neither the evidence nor the findings of the com - mission show a public necessity for trains 97 and 98 as means of trans - porting passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege, ~ when the daily service, equipment and connecting links of trains 102 and 103 are con - sidered with other available services of applicant and of other common carriers." ¦' .

"The examination and consideration of all the evidence lead to the conclusions that the operating expenses of passenger trains 97 and 98 far exceed the revenues therefrom; that those trains are not needed by the public for passenger traffic; that the continuous operation of trains 102 and 103 and of other utilities will furnish the public &gt;n this territory with adequate transportation for passengers, mail, express, cream and freight.'

The case was fairly, competently and fully submitted on the record. The service proposed to be abandoned consists of a gas-electric motor train of two cars leaving Aurora each morning at 5:00 o'clock. At Palmer, a rail distance of 36 miles from Aurora, the train divides one train continuing on to Sargent as No. 51 and the other continuing to Burwell as No. 51-53. On the return trip train 54t52 leaves Burvrell at 11:50 A. M. daily, and train No. 52 leaves Sargent at 11:35 A. M., the two trains uniting at Palmer and thence proceeds to Aurora as train No; 52 arriving at 4:00 P. M. The rail distance from Aurora to Burwell is 104 miles and to Sargent is 109 miles. Intermediate towns served are Marquette, Central 'City, Archer, Palmer, St. Paul, Midway, Farwell, Ashton, Schaupps, Loup City, McAlpine, Arcadia, Comstock and Sargent; on the Burwell Branch are the towns of Cushing, Wol - . bach, Brayton, Greeley Center, Horace, Sumter, Ord, Elyria and Bur - welt '- ¦¦ 'V'¦'¦.. ¦ :'¦ ¦-.;.- Since completion of construction of the line in 1887 there has al - ways been one passenger train daily operating on said branch. The present motor trains were substituted for steam trains in 1928 and 1932, and in 1932 this Commission authorized applicant to reverse the sched - ule leaving Aurora early in the morning, instead of the afternoon, in order at that time to save approximately $18,000 per annum in operat - ing cost, and also to furnish better mail service to the towns above named. The trains involved herein handle passengers, mail, express, baggage, milk, cream and newspaper shipments and occasionally han - dle carload shipments in order to expedite the freight service. Applicant offered many exhibits showing the number of passen - gers carried on said trains; the distance each traveled; the revenue ac - cruing from each passenger; the towns 'between which the passengers traveled, together with other exhibits showing cost of operation, total income, etc. Applicant's Exhibit No. 3 shows the average number of revenue passengers carried per train mile on said trains between the years 1923 and 1940, inclusive including both steam and motor trains as follows: ; . : ,'•.¦• </seg>

The Union Pacific Railroad Com - pany operates a similar type of gas-electric motor train from Grand. Island to Ord, and from St. Paul to Loup City, and also mixed pas - senger and freight trains connecting at Grand Island with the main line of the Union Pacific. Bus service is also available between Grand Island and Taylor, serving Farwell, Ashton, Schaupps, Loup- City, Arcadia, Comstock and Sargent on applicant's railroad. One bus schedule leaves Sargent at 8:00 A. M. and arrives at Grand Island at 10:50 A. M., and on the return trip leaves Grand Island 4:20 P. M. thus giving to those towns round trip service to Grand Island daily, and connection with other points in the state. Another bus line oper - ates two schedules daily between Grand Island and O'Neill, serving;. St. Paul and Greeley Center on the Burwell Branch of applicant's rail - road. A third bus line operates between Grand Island and Burwell,. on Highway No. 11 paralleling applicant's railroad to St. Paul, and thence on U, S. -Highway No. 281 to Grand Island. Two round trip schedules are provided, one leaving Burwell southbound at 8:00 A. M. and one leaving Grand Island northbound at 8:30 A. M. Central' City on said branch is located on U. S. Highway No. 30 and is served by the larger bus companies operating in both directions along said highway, and also by trains on the main line of the Union Pacific- A network of both state and federal highways completely covers the ter - ritory involved in this application and which was formerly served by the applicant railroad. ' . . . </seg>
         <seg id="p065">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The witness further testified that his investigation revealed that many people -who formerly relied upon the train service now use their private automobiles and the bus service available along the line- that private motor carriers run regularly scheduled service to all of the towns involved, delivering nearly all of the commodities consumed by the public, except the more bulky articles and those moving by carload such as coal and lumber. He testified that his investigation dis - closed 47 such private carriers serving Loup City; SO serving Central City; 16 serving Horace; 7 serving Brayton; 20 serving Cushing; 57 serving Ord and similar numbers in all of the towns. In addition he found 76 certificated common carriers by motor vehicle authorized to serve the various towns along said branch, hauling commodities gen - erally to and from Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island and other -whole - sale marketing points. Many of them maintain daily service. The remaining train service on said branch would consist of a mixed passenger and freight train No. 55-57, leaving Aurora daily at 5:30 A. M. to Palmer, and from Palmer to Sargent on Mondays, Wed - nesdays and Fridays; returning from Sargent to Palmer on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. ; Service to Burwell would leave Aurora as the same train and from Palmer would'proceed to Burwell on Tues - days, Thursdays and Saturdays; and from Burwell to Aurora on Mori - days, Wednesdays and Fridays. Said trains have been operated for a long period of time on the above schedule and appear to be satis - factory and no change is proposed at the present time. In addition to carload and L. C. L. shipments, the trains would handle passengers, baggage, express, newspapers and cream shipments. Many witnesses appeared and testified in opposition to the grant - ing of the application. Summarized, their testimony was to the effect that the reason for the depletion of revenue on the motor trains resulted from inadequacy of service; unfit riding qualities of the motor cars; length of time necessary to reach destinations; inability to complete round trips to the larger cities within one day; lack of representation and solicitation of patronage by applicant along the branch; continued drought in the territory since 1932; uncertainty of maintaining sched - ules and making connections. There is no doubt that the above objections to applicants services are well taken. However, it cannot well be denied that improvements of highways and the convenience, speed, comfort and flexibility of automobile and truck transportation, has made the competitive feature an unreasonable or unimportant one. Changing the schedules to operate in the opposite direction, or attempting to speed up the running time would not return the lost patronage to the rails. It is expecting too much to believe that the travelers along said branch would leave their automobiles at home and return to the slower more inconvenient </seg>
         <seg id="p066">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT passage to Grand Island, Aurora, Lincoln or Omaha. There remain too few people along branch line railroads who have remained faithful and loyal to the rails in the transportation of themselves and their merchandise. A careful study of the figures hereinbefore quoted will bear that out. It appears that in this era of an abundance of trans - portation facilities, the private automobiles carry most of the passen - gers formerly carried by rail, and the motor truck has superseded the rail service in handling most of the L. C. L. shipmentsv From the statistical exhibits and the testimony offered, it will be noted that the shipping public no longer is wholly dependent upon applicant Jo fur - nish passenger transportation service through the towns along said branch. Last year this Commission after hearing an application of the Bur lington to discontinue motor trains between Beatrice and Holdrege, de - nied the application. The facts were almost identical to the ones in the instant case, except that alternative transportation was not as sat - isfactory in that case as in this one, and that the average monthly loss in operating trains on the Beatrice-Holdrege Branch amounted to $500 per month, and in this case approximately $1,000 per month. On appeal to the Supreme Court the Commission's order was reversed, and among other things the Court said: '"••*•* Income from passenger traffic, averaging less than two passengers per train mile, is out of all proportion to the cost of operation as shown by uncontradicted evidence. There is no pub - lic necessity for exclusive passenger trains operated as such without compensable revenue nor is there any competent probative evidence of a material increase. Witnesses generally came to the hearing before the commission in private automobiles. They were prompt - ed by natural impulses to do so. They preferred a convenient, speedy and comfortable way to travel on highways constructed and improved at public expense. They started from their own doors. They were not hampered by railroad time tables or limited in speed by motor trains or delayed by stops at stations. It is expecting too much of human nature, of optimism, of forecasts for moisture, and of proper attitude toward the railroad company, to find that trains 97 and 98, if continued, will be substituted for automobiles in the transportation of passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege. Conditions of railroad transportation have changed since 1886, when this branch line was constructed, and the revenues during, the entire intervening period are not proper measures of earnings and expenses under present changed conditions. Earnings and ex - penses since 1932, a period suggested by remonstrants for compu - tations, are not proper measures of present or future profits and losses. Applicant must reckon with conditions resulting in present losses The slight decrease in the loss occasioned by the opera- </seg>
         <seg id="p067">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION tion of the motor passenger trains in 1939 was due in part to dis - missal of one member of a train crew. Neither the evidence nor the findings of the commission show a public necessity for trains 97 md 98 as means of transporting passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege, when the daily service, equipment and connecting links of trains 102 and 103 are considered with other available services of applicant and of other common carriers. Do the franchises and public duties of the applicant require it to operate these passenger trains for the incidental purposes of transporting United State mails, express and cream? It is not a duty of a railroad common carrier to run passenger trains at heavy monthly losses for years on a branch line railroad after such trains have been abandoned by the public for general and ordinary pass - enger traffic producing only a small decimal of operating expenses . where adequate facilities and public services are provided by daily mixed-service trains carrying passengers, mail, express and freight, and by other public utilities. Motor passenger trains operated on a branch line of railroad at a loss may properly be discontinued, where adequate public transportation is otherwise furnished, though the main line is operated at a profit. More moisture and resulting prosperity, anticipated by witnesses, are not likely to so change human nature as to turn short-trip passenger traffic, generally in rura? communities, from automobiles to motor trains on railroads. Ordinances imposing occupation taxes have not yet materially lessened transportation by motor buses and motor trucks in this territory and the evidence so proves. If, in the future, there should be any unreasonable departure from the schedules of trains 102 and 103, the regulatory power of the Nebraska railway com - mission will be available to the public for corrective remedies. It should not be assumed or found, in absence of evidence, of which there is none, that county officers will fai] to perform their duty to keep county roads in a reasonably safe condition for mail and express routes and for other public purposes; nor that the postmaster general of the United States will fail to perform his duly to fur - nish adequate mail services for the people residing alone this branch line of railroad. ?•?*•" Pertinent also, is the recent decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the application of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company requesting authority to abandon its line between Greeley Center and Ericson, Nebraska, Finance Docket No. 12486 in which it was said: . "The evidence shows that the line has been operated at a sub - stantial loss for several years, and that there is no prospect of more favorable results in the future. Some of the opposition witnesses </seg>
         <seg id="p068">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT anticipate an improvement in the prosperity of the tributary terri - tory, but there is no assurance that traffic on the line will increase in volume. On the other hand, much of the traffic formerly moved by the line is now handled by motor vehicles, and the small amount of traffic now handled can be moved by such vehicles with - out serious inconvenience to the public. Under these circumstances the rehabilitation and continued operation of the line would impose an undue burden upon the applicant and upon interstate commerce." In the case of Southern Railway Company vs. Public Service Com - mission, 10 S. E. (2d) 769, decided September 23, 1940, the Supiremq Court of South Carolina said: "The Court must take judicial notice of the conditions existing in the last few years which have resulted in much curtailment of* the business heretofore done by railroad companies. The de - pression is in part responsible, but aside from that, the remarkable development of motor vehicle transportation, both private and public, has had a revolutionary effect upon the railroad common carriers of the country, with a corresponding disturbance of their financial structure. They are therefore necessarily passing through a period of transition and readjustment. In the very recent case of Palmer v. Massachusetts, 308 U. S. 79, 60 S. Ct. 34, 38, 84 L. Ed. 93, cited by counsel for appellants here, in -which the opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, he stated: 'About a fourth of the railroad mileage of the country is now in bankruptcy.' In tha light of this rather startling statement it is manifest that railroad companies are not only justified in reducing their expenses, where it is practical to do so with reasonable regard to efficiency and with - out impairment of their absolute obligations, but that it is their duty to do so in the public interest." Under all of the circumstances and after a full and careful consid - eration of the record in this case, and a study of the briefs, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the trains are no longer necessary and that in the honest, efficient and economical management of applicant's rail - road, said application should be granted.

Nothing in the fore* going section shall be construed to prevent the Commission from having the power, when deemed by it necessary, to prevent interstate rate wars and injury to the business of the citizens of the state, railway companies or common carriers, or in case of any other emergency to be judged by the commission, and it shall be the duty of the commission, to temporarily alter, amend or suspend any existing freight rates, tariffs, schedules, orders and circulars of any railway company or common carrier, or part thereof, in this state, and to fix freight rates where none exist, which emergency rate or rates shall apply to any one or more or all railway companies or common carriers in this state, and shall take effect at such time and remain in force such length of time as may be prescribed by the Commission: Provided, said emergency rates, tariffs, schedules, orders and circulars shall be subject to review upon a hearing be - fore the commission and courts of competent jurisdiction in this state, as herein provided for other schedules of rates fixed by the commission." Since the issuance of our original order herein our attention has been directed to a controversy regarding the application of the emer - gency rates on .petroleum products which became effective January 2. 1941. In Supplement 15 to W. T. L. Tariff No, 337-B, the reduced rates authorized are published. The controversy involves item 13, which describes the commodities to which rates apply. The tariff description, is shown below: "Fuel Oil, distillate, (not suitable for illuminating purposes): This tariff item has been construed as limiting the application of "Fuel Oil" rates to distillate only. On this tariff application the car - load rate of "distillate" from Nebraska refineries to Fairbury is 10 cents per cwt., but the rate on other fuel oil is \7J/a cents per cwt. The Ne - braska refineries at both Salem and Falls City are producing a relative - ly large proportion of fuel oil, as compared with high volatile products, such as gasoline, which must be marketed promptly if the refineries are to continue in operation. The bulk of such fuel oil is a product less volatile than distillate and therefore cannot be properly described in ship - ping papers. . . We are informed that our Nebraska refineries cannot dispose of their principal product, low grade fuel oil, at the higher rates, as illus- </seg>
         <seg id="p071">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION trated above, and it is contended that the lower "Fuel Oil" rate now applied to distillate, gasoline and kerosene should be made applicable to the cheap fuel oil produced by our refineries. The current Western Classification No. 69 publishes the following description of Fuel Oil in item364os: "Fuel Oil, residual and/or distillate, not suitable for illuminating purposes." The substitution of this description for that now published -would make the lower commodity rates applicable from Falls City and Salem. The circumstances recited above show that the original "emergen - cy" found by us in our original decision still exists insofar as rates on low grade fuel oil produced by the Falls City and Salem refineries are concerned.

Two other witnesses for applicant testified that they made special investigation along the two branches and in the adjacent territory to determine what other means of transportation was being furnished the general public both as to passenger and to freight. The Santa Fe Trailways, a motor carrier of passengers and express serves the towns on the Fairmont-Chester branch, maintaining two schedules in each direction daily. Hebron on said branch is served by two additional bus lines running in ah easterly-westerly .direction. They further testified that .private motor carriers from the various jobbing centers in the state deliver nearly all of the commodities consumed by the pub - lic except the more bulky articles such as coal and lumber. They fur - ther testified that from 12 to 81 private motor carriers furnish schedule service to all of the towns on both branches. It was also testified that from an investigation made from the' files of this Commission it was revealed that from five to 20 common carriers by motor vehicle have been authorized to serve the various communities involved herein in the transportation of commodities generally between said towns and conanunltiie* to and from various towns within the state. ••: '&#132;¦'¦¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p078">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Another witness testified as to the handling of U. S. mail along the branches. No mail is now being handled by applicant on the Ches - ter branch, that service being performed by a star route carrier. Closed pouch service is furnished by applicant on the Endicott branch, and it is proposed that a star route carrier service will be substituted in lieu thereof. Numerous witnesses appeared and testified in opposition to the granting of the application. Summarized, their testimony was to the general effect that the reason for the depletion of revenue has been the continued drought condition in that territory; because of pres - ent merchandising .practices whereby stocks are small and kept fresh by frequent purchases; that the delay of one day under applicant's proposal would work a hardship on the communities; that rush orders inbound and outbound would be impossible; that part of the loss in revenue could be attributed to lack of representation and solicitation of patronage by applicant along the branches. Two gravel pit opera - tors testified that the proposed curtailment of service would delay their shipments to contractors as they often ship at least 10 cars a day so projects can keep moving. Applicant Jater testified that in the event such movements be contracted and applicant be notified, extra trains would be operated in order to transport the gravel shipments. The curtailment of any service furnished by a public utility is al - ways the object of grave concern; not only to the people living along branch line railroads, but to all of the people of the state. There can be no doubt that the curtailment of service such as proposed here - in would result in some inconvenience to the shippers along the lines, and more particularly to the witnesses who appeared and testified dur - ing the hearing. In the main, their objections were well founded. As regulatory officials it is our bounden duty to see that reasonable, adequate service is provided the general public. In so doing, we must confine ourselves to the rules and regulations of the administrative law and to the various court decisions interpreting Commission orders. It must be remembered that this application docs not propose to com - pletely abandon service on the two branches. The most serious in - jury that could result would be a delay in some instances of one day in the shipment or delivery of freight. There are a great many tri - weekly schedules in effect on the various railroads of the state. It would appear that in this case to deny applicant the right to change to tri-weekly service and thus save approximately $20,000 annually with no serious curtailment of service would amount to a confiscation of propery and a denial oi due process. In the case of Southern Railway Company vs. Public Service Com - mission, 10 S. E. &lt;2d) 769, decided September 23, 1940, the Supreme Court of South Carolina said: : ' ¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p079">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "The Court must take judicial notice of the conditions existing in the last few years which have resulted in much curtailment of the business heretofore done by railroad com - panies. The depression is in part responsible, but aside from that, the remarkable development of motor vehicle transporta - tion, both private and public, has had a revolutionary effect upon the railroad common carriers of the country, with a cor - responding disturbance of their financial structure. They are there - fore necessarily passing through a period of transition and read - justment In the very recent case of Palmer v. Massachu - setts, 308 U. S. 79, 60 S. Ct 34, 38, 84 L. Ed. 93, cited by coun - sel for appellants here, in which the opinion was delivered by • Mr. Justice Frankfurter, he stated: 'About a fourth of the railroad mileage of the country is now in bankruptcy.' In the light of this rather startling statement it is manifest that ;'. railroad companies are not only justified in reducing their expenses, where it is practicable to do so with reasonable re - gard to efficiency and without; impairment of their absolute obligations, but that it is their duty to do so in tht public in - • ¦ terest." ¦'¦'" ' ¦¦'¦'¦':¦¦' ..."

Co. to abandon its line of railroad between Grecley, Center and Ericson, Nebraska, Finance Docket No. 12486, a - moiig other things said: : / ¦ : "The evidence shows that the line has been operated at a substantial loss for several years, and that t there is no pros - pect of more favorable results in the future. Some of the opposition witnesses anticipate an improvement in the pros - perity of the tributary territory, but there is no assurance that traffic on the line will increase in volume. On the other hand, much of the traffic formerly moved by the line is now handled by motor vehicles, and the small amount of traffic now handled can be moved by such vehicles without serious inconvenience to the public. Under these circumstances, the rehabilitation , and continued operation of the line would impose an undue burden ;upon the applicant and upon interstate commerce." In Kara vi. State, (Okla.) 66 P. 2d 52 which involved curtailment of service on a railroad, the Supreme Court said: ; "The patronizing public, as a rule, have no right to de - mand conveniences without just compensation to the party furnishing the same.- Neither an individual nor corporation, as a rule, can be required to furnish conveniences without just : compensation, or at a loss to itself.

(2d) 402, 406, it was pointed out that the federal statutes require interstate carriers to operate their railroads efficiently and economically. The following language is found in the body of the opinion: " 'It is perfectly natural that every •com - munity should aspire to the best railroad service to be had. We have full sympathy with such aspirations. Yet it is to be remembered that, under our system of public control of rates and service, the general public, speaking broadly, loses in cost what it gains in service. So the railroad, in resisting demands for any uneconomic service, really represents the true interest of the general public.' " ' " Our own Supreme Court in the case of C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. vt. Commission, 295 N. W. 389, decided December 20, 1940, reversed an order of this Commission denying applicant authority to discontinue passenger train service between Holdrege and Beatrice, and among 1 other things said: " * * * It is expecting too much of human nature, of opti- ¦ mism, of forecasts for moisture, and of proper attitude toward the railroad company, to find that trains 97 and 98, if continued, will be substituted for automobiles in the transportation of passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege. Conditions of railroad transportation have changed since 1886, when this branch line was constructed, and the revenues during the en - tire intervening period are not proper measures of earnings and expenses under present changed conditions. .Earnings and expenses since 1932, a period suggested by remonstrants for computations, are not proper measures of present or future profits and losses. Applicant must reckon with conditions resulting in present losses." Under all of the circumstances and after a full and careful con - sideration of the testimony, exhibits, and the court decisions, the Com - mission is of the opinion that in the honest, efficient, and economic management of said railroad said application should bo granted effec - tive November I, 1941.

Protesting witnesses appeared and testified, and were represented by counsel. The evidence disclosed that Goehner, Seward County, Nebraska, is an incorporated village of approximately 125 people, located on the </seg>
         <seg id="p082">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Fremont-Superior branch of applicant's railroad approximately 8.1 miles Southwest of Seward, and 5.6 miles Northeast of Beaver Crossing, both being regular open-agency stations on said line. Business houses consist of two grain elevators, general merchandise store, bank, two blacksmith shops, pool hall and barber shop, garage and a ¦con - tractor's office. The Lincoln-Billings line of the C. B. &amp;Q.R. R. Co., passes in an Easterly-Westerly direction approximately five miles North of Goehner, and the Lincoln-Columbus line of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., is located to the east of Goehner approximately seven miles. The Chicago-Denver main line of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., passes to the South of Goehner, approximately 12 miles. U. S. paved High - way No. 34 extends in an Easterly-Westerly direction approximately five miles to the North of Goehner, and U. S. paved Highway No. 6 is approximately 12 miles to the South, connected by a county-main - tained gravelled road passing directly through Goehner. The terri - tory immediately adjacent and tributary to Goehner is devoted to agri - culture and to the raising and feeding of livestock. At the present time, and for many years last past, applicant has bit - nished regular agent-operator service at said station. The present train service on the branch consists of a mixed passenger and freight trafp Westbound on Mondays,; Wednesdays and Fridays, through Goehner at 9:45 A. M.., and Eastbound on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, passing through Goehner at 3:40 P. M. The trains do not carry U. S. mail, that service being performed by a Star Route carrier. No changes in train service are contemplated in the instant application. Statistical exhibits offered by applicant, and received in evidence, show the total revenue at the station from all sources, including car - load and L.C.L. shipments received and forwarded; ticket sales; baggage ex - press; milk and miscellaneous income. The figures were compiled for the years 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940 and the first five months of 1941. Exhibit 3 credits the station with 50 percent of the revenue derived from all carload and L. C. L. shipments of freight received and for - warded at Goehner, which originated and terminated on the C &amp; N. W.; 100 percent of passenger revenue, and also miscellaneous in - come; 22 percent of the gross express revenue. The exhibit further assigns 75 percent of the actual line haul revenue accruing to the ap - plicant on carload and L. C. L, shipments originating at Goehner and destined to points on foreign railroads, and likewise on those originat - ing on foreign railroads and destined Goehner. However, no good and sufficient reason appears in the record why the full 100 percent of the revenue accruing to applicant upon interline shipments should not be credited to the station. Junction points with foreign railroads do not make deliveries to consignees and no accounting is made at those points as relates to duties performed by agency service. Appli- </seg>
         <seg id="p083">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION cant's duties at such interline junction points appear in the record to be almost identical with those performed at junction points with local freight movements, and under the circumstances the Commission is of the opinion that the full 100 per cent figures should be used. The above allocation is the one generally used by the various commissions and by the courts. ..' '¦ Based upon the above computation, including 100 percent of the revenue accruing to applicant on interline traffic, the total revenue credited to the station of Goehner for the year 1937 from all sources amounted, to $2,790.71. The gross revenue at the station for that year was $5,116.78. For the year 1938 the gross revenue at the station was $7,386.38, and the net amount credited to the station was $3,828.70. During 1939 the gross revenue was $6,111.22 and the net assigned reve - nue amounted to $3,509.27. Bor the year 1940 the gross revenue was $3,427.11, and the .net assigned revenue amounted to $2,001.07. For - the first five months of 1941 the gross revenue was $1,52636, and the net assigned revenue was $879,83. . v :'¦... Wages paid the agent, including payroll taxes, amounted to $1,461.40 during 1937; $1,686.67 during 1938; $1,687.36 during 1939; $1,696.32 dur - ing 1940 and $700.02 during the first five months of 1941. These fig - ures do not include fuel, telephone, stationery, supplies and station maintenance. Nearly all of the revenue accruing to the station for the period shown resulted from carload shipments. Applicant's Exhibit 6 shows the average number of shipments received and forwarded on a daily basis. Analyzed further the exhibit tends to show the extent of time and services demanded of the agent relating to the number of shipments handled as follows; ¦r- Carload Less Carload : Shipments No. of Days Shipments No. of Days Year ¦¦'¦'¦ Per Day - Per Shipment Per Day Per Shipment 1937 20 4.94 .70 1.42 1938 .21 4.71 .45 2.32 ;.. „ 1939 .25 4.08 .35 2.83 1940 ; . 14 658 .36 277 Jan. to May, 1941, Inc. .15 6.68 .35 2.82 .Applicant proposes to substitute the services of a custodian or; caretaker for the agent at Goehner, Applicant's witnesses testified that the caretaker would live in the depot; would keep the station open, dean and warm; would secure information for shippers relating to the rates and train service; order cars; have cars spotted for, loading or unloading; inspect cars for grain loading; seal cars; furnish infor - mation to the agent at either Seward or Beaver Crossing in billing </seg>
         <seg id="p084">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT out shipments. L, C. L. shipments would be loaded or unloaded from trains and placed in the depot, and later be delivered to consignees; loss or damage claims would be noted; express shipments would be handled in the same manner as at present; the caretaker would not sell tickets or accept money for freight shipment Commercial tele - phone service would remain available in the depot. Passengers would, pay their fares directly to conductors who would also check their baggage if desired. Cream shipments would be billed by* the conduc - tor. Stock yards, buildings and industrial tracks would remain as they are at present. By inaugurating said substituted service, appli - cant alleges it would annually save the agent's salary, together with payroll taxes thereon. It was also testified by applicant that numerous certificated com - mon carrier motor truck lines operate in and through Goehner and the surrounding territory, furnishing the merchants and shippers with di - rect competitive transportation facilities on all commodities from tfie various jobbing centers in the state. Motor vehicles also carry live - stock- to and from sales barns, but do not transport the heavier com - modities such as coal, lumber, sand, etc. Witnesses appearing in opposition to the granting of the applica - tion testified that the chief reason for the decline in station revenue in the past several years is the result of continued drought conditions and the shortage of livestock and grain in the territory; that many bushels of corn, wheat, barley and oats are in storage under Govern - ment sea! on farms and in elevators, and when released will either be shipped by rail or fed to livestock, and later shipped to market, thus again necessitating the use of applicant's agent and railroad. Chief opposition came from carload shippers of grain, lumber and coal. In the case of Southern Railway Company vs. Public Service Com - mission, 10 S. E. (2d) 769, decided September 23, 1040, the Supreme Court ot South Carolina reversed the Commission's order denying applicant's request to close a station on its line. The gross revenue at that station was $6,961.19 for the year 1937, the only year shown. The Court said. "At the hearing before the Commission there was very little testimony against the discontinuance of the: agency, al - though a petition for its retention, signed by a number of resi - dents, was filed. The principal witness, who had made a few '•¦ carload shipments of wood products from Silver Street,, testi - fied that he found it convenient to use the telegraph agency there for the purpose of ordering cars for that and other sta - tions. And his testimony also shows that he had shipped </seg>
         <seg id="p085">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION from non-agency stations. It is apparent that the only material inconvenience which would be suffered by him is the necessity of going to some other station having a tele - graph agency to arrange for the placing of cars. A careful examination of all the testimony in behalf of the patrons of the station lends to the conclusion that while doubtless, some relatively minor inconvenience may result in some cases to the customers of the railroad company, there will be no seri - ous effect upon the business of these patrons, and that in the light of the evidence, it would not be just or reasonable to re - quire the railroad company to continue this agency under the existing conditions, considering the loss thereby sus - tained." "The Court must take judicial notice of the conditions existing in the last few years which have resulted in much . curtailment of the business heretofore done; by railroad com - panies. The depression is in part responsible, but aside from that, the remarkable development of motor vehicle transpor - tation, both private and public, has had a revolutionary effect . upon the railroad common carriers of the country, with a corresponding disturbance of their financial structure. They are therefore necessarily passing through a period of transi - tion and readjustment. In the very recent case of Palmer v. Massachusetts, 308 U.S. 79, 60 S. Ct.,34, 38, 84; L. Ed. 93, cited by counsel for appellants here, in which the opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, he stated: 'About a fourth of the railroad mileage of the country is now in bank - ruptcy.* In the light of this rather startling statement it is manifest that railroad companies are not only justified in reducing their expenses, where it is practicable to do so with reasonable regard to efficiency and without impairment of their absolute obligations, but that it is their duty to do so ' in the public interest" ¦'." . ; . ! -;.,.' i ; ¦:-¦.' In the case of Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company vi. CommiMton, 295 N. W. 389, decided December 20, 1940 the Su - preme Court of Nebraska in reversing this Commission's order denying the applicant authority to discontinue two branch line motor trains operating between Holdrege and Beatrice, among other things said: " * • * It is expecting too much of human nature, of opti - mism, of forecasts for moisture, and of proper attitude toward the railroad company, to find that trains .97 and 98, if con - tinued, will be substituted for automobiles in the transporta - tion of passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege. Condi - tions of railroad transportation have changed since 1886, when </seg>
         <seg id="p086">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT this branch line was constructed, and the revenues during the entire intervening period are not proper measures of earnings and expenses under present changed conditions. Earnings and expenses since 1932, a period suggested by remonstrants for computations are not proper measures of present or future profits and losses. Applicant must reckon with conditions resulting in present losses." A case very much in point, and recognizing the above principles is the most recent pronouncement of the Minnesota Supreme Court in State v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 297 N. W. 715, released April 25, 1941. The syllabus reads as follows: "Order oj Railroad and Warehouse Commission denying railroad leave to substitute station 'custodian' for part-time agency service held unreasonable where annual gross revenue had decreased to $4,793.63 for year immediately preceding peti - tion; where 78.8 per cent, thereof was derived from carload freight, which will be served practically as before; where only $1,012.93 was derived from other-thart-carload business and a saving of almost $1,000 will result from the proposed change; and where the only inconvenience to patrons will be discon - tinuance of money transactions." It is true that there may be some inconvenience to the few re - maining shippers at Goehner if this substitution is granted, but this Commission having jurisdiction over rates, service and general -con - trol of common carriers, is in this and similar applications primarily concerned with service. Its duty is to see that reasonably adequate service is rendered to the general shipping public by the carrier. That the L. C. L. traffic of the rails is drastically reduced by truck competition cannot be successfully controverted, nor can it be reason - ably assumed that the rails can ever recapture any substantial portion of the lost traffic. Applicant must in large measure depend upon carload traffic, which in our opinion can be handled with practically the same expedition and efficiency by caretaker as by an agent. The applicant laboring under adverse financial conditions, and in the pro - cess of reorganization under the Federal Bankruptcy Act, would be enabled to reduce operating expenses at least to the extent of the present agent's salary, together with payroll taxes. If the services rendered by a caretaker should be later shown to be inadequate, or if business again reaches the state of normalcy, the shippers, and patrons have their remedy. The Commission is always available for re - dress or grievances complained about. Under the circumstances and after a full consideration of the records in this case, the Commission is of the opinion that the present </seg>
         <seg id="p087">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION revenue received at Goehner, the duties required of the agent, the ser - vice furnished by other means of transportation, and the general con - ditions under which applicant is now operating, require that in the honest, efficient and economical management of applicant's railroad, said application should be granted, order ,';¦•:.

Coincident with the effective date of Nebras - ka Official Common Carrier Truck Rates, Classification,. Rules and Regulations prescribed in our Resolution 146, the applicant, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company filed its application, dated February 15, 1?&gt;38, requesting authority to apply its duly authorized railroad rates to the transportation of less than carload freight when transported by trucks, owned and operated by said applicant, between Lincoln and Ashland and between Omaha, Fort Crook, Bcllevue, Chalco and Gretna, such truck operations having been in existence before April 1, 1936. By our order in Application 12826, effective February 18, 1938, the Nebraska State Railway Commission authorized the applicant, Chi - cago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to publish the tariff nlc set forth below in W. T. L. Tariff 262-D: • :;;'¦"•¦ "Wherever as to less than carload freight, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company substitutes, for a.por - tion of the haul at its option, highway vehicle service for ac - tually available service by railroad between stations on its line, the rates and charges as published in this tariff, or as amended, will apply to the through service." The authority granted was subject to expiration date, but has been extended and as slightly modified is now effective. By similar applications, authority was granted to other applicants </seg>
         <seg id="p090">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT to publish similar tariff provisions governing the substitution of high - way vehicle service for railroad service at rates published for application by rail between the points involved. The real questions here involved are as follows: I. Shall the existing tariff authorities for substitution of mo - tor vehicle for rail services, as to less than carload freight, which exist by virtue of our approval heretofore granted; be transferred from the separate railroad rate tariffs to a tariff known as National Substituted Freight Service Directory No. 1-A published by Agent L. E. Kipp and filed with the Inter - state Commerce Commission as I. C. C. No. A-3245? 11. Shall the applicant, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, be authorized to extend the existing substituted high - way service tariff rule governing less than carload shipments now transported by motor vehicles directly owned and operated by that company to include the operations of its wholly owned subsidiary the Burlington Transportation Company which is a duly authorized motor vehicle common carrier operating be - tween points in Nebraska also served by the parent company, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company? The answers to both questions seem to Be obvious. The first question involves the mechanics of tariff publication only. The com - petitive position of the applicants and the protesting motor vehicle com - mon carriers will not be changed, in any respect, by publishing the exist-' ing tariff authority in L. E. Kipp's tariffs, I. C. C. Nos. A-3134 and A-3181, as proposed herein. The second question raises the issue whether the applicant, Chicago,' Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, should be authorized to trans - port less than carload freight, between points now served by its rail - road, in motor vehicles operated by its wholly owned subsidiary, the Burlington Transportation Company, as well as in motor vehicles which it directly owns and operates between points in this state. Although an affirmative answer to this question seems inescapable, we feel that the opposition to the granting of this authority voiced by many Nebraska motor vehicle common carriers and their state organi - zation seems to justify some discussion of the principles upon which this matter should be decided. The Nebraska Legislature enacted legis- </seg>
         <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION lattve standards governing the exercise of the powers and duties of the Nebraska State Railway Commission relating to the certification of motor vehicles for hire and the regulation of the service, rates, classifi - cation, rules and regulations to be maintained and applied by such carriers in their operations in Legislative Bill No. 178, the 1937 session, Chapter 142, Laws of 1937, Section 75-222 to 75-238, Nebraska statutes. Section 75-222 contains the following declaration of legislative policy: .;.;¦ "It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Legislature to regulate transportation by motor carriers in intrastate com - merce upon the public highways of Nebraska in such manner as to recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of, and foster sound economic conditions in, such transportation and among such carriers in the public interest; promote adequate, economical and efficient service by motor carriers, and reason - able charges therefor, without unjust discrimination, undue preferences or advantages, and unfair or destructive competitive practices; improve the relations between, and coordinate trans-, portalion by and regulation of, motor carriers and other car - riers; develop, and preserve a highway transportation system : properly adapted to the needs of the commerce of Nebraska; cooperate with the several states and the duly authorized pfri - . cials thereof; and cooperate with the Interstate Commerce Com - mission in the administration and enforcement of the federal "Motor Carrier Act, 1935," approved by the President on August 9, 1935. The Legislature declares that all of the available carriage service, including common carriage by rail and road and contract carriage by road, arc: so interdependent that the public may not continue to have a safe and dependable trans - portation system unless contract carriers operating on the same roads with common carriers are brought under just and reason - able regulations bringing their service into relation with com - . ¦'.-. mon carriers." ¦ .: , . , -The testimony, in this proceeding, shows that cars used in trans - portation of less than carload freight are generally loaded to but a frac - tion of their carrying capacity.. Competent operating officers testified that the transportation of less than carload freight by truck in the pro - posed substituted service would release 100 box cars a week for trans - portation of carload freight and that the demand for sucli cars in trans - portation of raw materials for defense industries and for the finished products of. munitions, supplies and military equipment of all kinds is taxing the available car supply of all American railroads with a constant threat of possible car shortage. The American Truckers' Association and all other groups of motor vehicle carriers recognize the importance of using highway vehicles of all kinds to supplement railroad transpor - tation facilities in the existing period of national emergency. </seg>
         <seg id="p092">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Local or way frieght trains serve the double purpose of handling less than carload freight to and from railroad freight stations and the movement and spotting of loaded and empty cars used in transportation of car - load shipments. To relieve way freight trains from handling less than carload freight should save time and expense in the transportation of important carload traffic. Such an assignment of less than carload transportation functions to motor vehicles and the more efficient result - ing use of railroad facilities for the carload traffic is comprehended in our statutory duty ** to "improve the relations between, and coordinate transportation by and regulation of, motor carriers and other car - riers" *• . The existence of a national defense emergency argues the need for prompt action in this proceeding to effect results which are proper objectives of regulation regardless of the existing extraordinary demand for railroad facilities. The Interstate Commerce Commission has repeatedly passed on similar proposals. In Kansas City Southern Transport Company, In - corporated, 10 M. C. C. 221, p. 235, wherein the Interstate Commerce Commission said: "The railway is now furnishing a less-than-carload, or mer - chandise, freight service which is expensive and in many re - spects unsatisfactory and inefficient. Through applicant, if the certificate sought to be obtained, it proposes to use motor vehicles in coordination with its rail operations in such a way that a merchandise service can be provided that will be much less expensive and at the same time more expeditious and more convenient and generally satisfactory to the public served. That these results can be achieved the record leaves no doubt. Moreover, it is clear that this coordi - nated rail-motor service will be a new form of service, utilizing both forms of transportation to advantage, and differing from the service given by the railway alone or by competing motor carriers alone. That Congress contemplated such coordination is shown by section 202 (a) of the act, which declares it to be the policy of Congress, among other things, to "improve the relations between, and coordinate transportation by and regulation of, motor carriers and other carriers." It is also shown by section 213 (a) (1), which permits a railroad to acquire a motor carrier, provided we find that the acquisition will promote the! public interest by enabling the railroad to "use service by motor vehicle to public advantage in its operations," without undue restraint of competition. It follows that the new form of service "will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need. Is^ it necessary, however, that applicant be given the desired certifi- </seg>
         <seg id="p093">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION cate in order to accomplish this purpose, or can it be "served as well by existing lines or carriers"? As'shown in appendix C, a number of independent motor carriers'now afford service to and from most of the points applicant proposes to serve, and between some of the points they maintain several schedules each day.. These motor carriers are protestants and they contend that whatever coordination .of rail and motor service may be desirable can be accomplished by the railway through arrangements with them and utilities of their facilities, or, at all events, that this method of attaining the result sought should be tried before applicant is permitted to establish a new service. ' ¦•'¦.., ;..-;. ' ¦•.;./;. &gt; The railway regards any plan of coordination with inde - pendent motor carriers as impracticable. It goes so far, in - deed, as to suggest that if it contemplated retirement from the handling of merchandise traffic, it could do so more gracefully and at less expense than by entering into joint arrangements with parallel competing: truck lines, from which the railway is convinced "it could reasonably expect no bona fide coordina - tion or cooperation." .;..¦ '¦"I :¦¦:'... We are without jurisdiction to compel coordinated service between carriers by rail and carriers by motor vehicle. It could only te accomplished through the medium of through routes and joint rates and we have no power to require their establishment. It follows that any such plan must be depen - dent .on voluntary cooperation. While protestants say that they are willing to entertain proposals, they have not develop - ed a plan nor do they suggest what general form it might take, . It is evident that grave difficulties would be encountered. The coordinated service which the railway contemplates estab - lishing with applicant would embrace the entire system of the railway, and each and every one of its stations. Since appli - cant, if it obtains the desired certificate, would operate between all the stations, it would be in a position to join in furnishing such service. No one of the protesting motor -carriers, how - ever, serves any large number of the stations, and some of the smaller stations now have no service by motor carrier. In order to establish the proposed coordinated service through the cooperation of independent motor carriers, it would be necessary, therefore, for the railway to make arrangements, not with one, but with several, each performing a more or less disjointed part of the entire service, and it would also be neces - sary for some one or more of protestants to obtain authority to serve those little stations which now have no motor-carrierl 93 </seg>
         <seg id="p094">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT service. Moreover, the protesting motor carriers all serve points, and often important points, not served by the railway. They would find it difficult to adjust their schedules to meet the needs of coordination with the rail service without disrupt - ing ov impairing their service to the off-rail points. In addition to these difficulties and obstacles to any plan of coordination with the protesting motor carriers, it is urged very strongly by the railway that, in order to accomplish sat - isfactory coordination and attain the desired flexibility of rail-' truck operations, it is essential that the rail and truck lines have a unity of interest and be under a common management and control. In view of the close adjustment of schedules and interchange arrangements which good and dependable ser - vice would require, as well as the contemplated joint use of stations and employees, we believe that the railway has sound ground for this contention. The declaration of legislative policy in our statute is the same as that of the Motor Carrier Act, Interstate Commerce Acts, Part 2. Citing the decision in the Kansas City Southern Transport case supra the Interstate Commerce Commission said in Guy A. Thompson, Trus - tee, Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. Extension of Operations, 20 M. C. C. 563, pp. 564 and 565: "The operation for which authority is sought is stated to lie a coordinated rail-truck service, involving the movement of less-than-carload freight between railroad stations by the use of trucks on highways that parallel as closely as possible the rail lines operated by applicant, thereby freeing the rail lines to a large extent for the movement of carload traffic and rendering the movement of both the carload and less-than-carload traffic more expeditious to destination, with consequent savings in operating costs.**** We have decided in Kansas City S. Transport Co., Inc., Com. Car. Application, 10 M. C. C. 221, and in Texas &amp; P. Motor Transport Co, Com. Car. Applic.—Louisiana, 10 M. C C. 525, and in other cases, that operations similar to those pro - posed by applicant will be economical, will improve the rail - road's service, are demanded by the public interest, and should be approved and encouraged.*'***" At the first hearing in this proceeding protesting motor carriers contended that the proposed inclusion of operations of the Burlington Transportation Company would enable that motor vehicle common carrier lo transport merchandise traffic at lower rates and charges </seg>
         <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION than competing motor vehicle common carriers in instances where the railroad tariffs provide a lower classification rating, freight rate or charge than that applicable between the same points via motor carriers. As the result of informal conferences between Nebraska railroad and motor vehicle carriers fit which the Commission was represented by our Rate Department an agreement between the carriers was reached which contemplates the establishment of the same ratings, rates and charges for transportation of less than carload freight by rail and by motor carrier routes between the same points of origin and destination in this state. The principle of rate equality involved in that agree - ment has already been approved by us in various decisions in which competitive rates and charges of these two competing groups of carriers were involved. Steps are being taken to make this agreement effect - ive as to both intrastate and related interstate rates, ratings and charge's. ••¦•".'¦ ': ¦It was further contended by protestants that existing common car - rier facilities by rail and motor vehicle are adequate to meet all present demands of both normal traffic and defense materials and supplies. This proceeding does not propose to increase existing transport facili - ties by rail and by truck but rather to authorize the more efficient use of truck facilities, owned and operated by applicants and their sub sidiaries or contractors, to transport less carload freight and permit more efficient use of box-cars and local or way freight trains operating between points in this state. We conclude that the proposed "substi - tution rules" will result in coordinated rail and truck service siich as is contemplated by our law, applying the reasoning of the Interstate Commerce Commission in cases cited above, with which we agree. The protesting Nebraska Commercial Truckers' Association asks the Commission to issue a general order permitting applicants and'other Nebraska railroads to make and publish similar substitution provisions. The general questions involved in such arrangements are discussed herein but we cannot properly take the action suggested by protestants, Any such tariff rule proposed by a Nebraska railroad not involved herein or any extension of substitution rules by applicants herein, to additional points of origin or destination, involve changes in the exist - ing rules and regulations and the application of existing rates which cannot lawfully be effected without our express approval. It must be apparent that existing laws would not permit us to approve, in ad - vance, possible agreements between railroads and motor carriers and incidental necessary changes in tariffs the exact nature of which are presently unknown to the prospective parties to such agreements and to the Commission. However, it is clear that the authority granted herein should not be confined to substituted service arrangements in connection with the motor vehicle common carriers named in this ap- </seg>

Authority should be granted to the applicant railroad com - panies to provide substituted highway vehicle service between the points covered by this application by the employment of other duly authorized regular route raotcr vehicle common carriers operating be - tween the points of origin and destination set out in this application. In view of the facts of record, the arguments of parties and the law applicable hereto, we are of the opinion and find that the application should be granted, that an emergency exists and that the proposed revised tariff rules should be made effective on and after November 19, Wl. We further find that applicants should be granted authority to make arrangements for substituted highway service of other certified motor vehicle common carriers operating on regular routes between the points involved in this application and to publish tariff amendments on one day's notice making such further substitution arrangements effec - tive.

         <seg id="p099">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION trie motor trains Nos. 523 and 524 between Columbus and Albion, Ne - braska. After due notice to all concerned, the matter came on for public hearing in the District Court Room at Columbus, before Com - missioners Good and Larson, on the 7th day of October, 1941, at 9-00 A.M. . ¦¦_,:. ..".:: The motor trains in question operate on the following schedules: Train No. 524 leaves Albion at 6:30 A. M., arriving Columbus at 7:40 A. M, daily. Train No. 523 leaves Columbus at 7:00 P. M. and arrives Albion at 8:30 P. M. daily. The trains serve Columbus, Oconee, pop - ulation 71; Monroe (315); Genoa (1231); Wbodville (20); St. Edward (893); Boone (230); and Albion (2668). The rail distance is 43 miles. Applicant's Exhibit No. 18 shows that during 1939, train No. 523 carried a total of 3180 passengers,: averaging 8.71 passengers, producing $5.42 revenue per trip for the year. Train No. 524, during 1939 carried 1714 passengers, averaging 4.69 passengers, producing $2.62 revenue per trip. During 1940, train No. 523 carried 3272 passengers, averag - ing 8.94 passengers, producing $4.98 revenue a trip. Train No. 524, during 1940, carried 1650 passengers, averaging 4.51 passengers, pro - ducing $2.58 revenue a trip. During the first 6 months of 1941, train No. 523 carried 1123 passengers, averaging 6.42 passengers, producing $3.69 revenue a trip, and train No. 524, for the same period, carried 784 passengers, averaging 4.48 passengers, producing $2.65 revenue per trip. The total revenue credited to the trains from all sources, including freight, passengers, mail, express, milk and cream, for the year 1940, amounted to $7,405.44. The actual out-of-pocket cost of operating the trains for the same year amounted to $12,992.82, resulting in an actual. out-of-pocket loss of $5,587.38. Broken down further, the opera - tion resulted in a loss of 17.75£ for every mile operated during the year. During the first 6 months of 1941, the total revenue received from the operation of the trains amounted to $2,816.22, and the out-of-pocket cost of operation was $6,258.99, or a net loss of $3,442.77. The net loss per train mile was 21.881./ Additional service on the branch consists of a daily except Sunday mixed train, leaving Columbus at 6:50 A. M., arriving Albion at 8:50 A. .M. In , the opposite direction, the train leaves Albion at 1:30 P. M. and arrives Columbus at 3:20 P. M. The towns of Oconee, Monroe, and Genoa are also served by one daily mixed train in each direction, operating on through Genoa to Spalding from Columbus, and one daily except Sunday mixed train in each direction on the same branch. No change is contemplated in the mixed train service. At Columbus the branch connects with the main line of applicant's railroad. , The Lin - coin - Columbus branch of the C. B. &amp; Q.R. R.

SoTof mail service except as it may have some beann*^.th other factors relative to reasonable adequate tram service. By 3V y. S. C. A. 539, the Congress of the United States declared: 'The Postmaster General shall in all cases decide upon what trains and in what manner the mails shall be conveyed. Every railroad company carrying the mails shall carry on any train it operates, and with due speed, all mailable matter, equipment and supplies directed to be carried thereon." No objection was received by the Commission from the United States Post Office Department in the instant case. In the case of Southern Ry. Co. v.. Public Service Commfario^lO S. li. &lt;2d&gt; 769, decided September 23, 1940, the Supreme Court of South Carolina said: "The Court must take judicial notice of the conditions exist - ing in the last few years which have resulted in much curtail - ment of the business heretofore done by railroad companies. The depression is in part responsible, but aside from thaV the remarkable development of motor vehicle transportation, both private and public, has had a revolutionary effect .upon the railroad common carriers of the country, with a corresponding disturbance of their financial structure. They are therefore necessarily passing through a period of transition and readjust - ment In the very recent case of Palmer v. Massachusetts, </seg>
         <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 308 U. S. 79, 60 S. Ct 34, 38, 84 L. Ed. 93, cited by counsel for ¦ appellants here, in which the opinion' was delivered by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, he stated: 'About a fourth of the railroad mileage of the country is now in bankruptcy.' In the light of this rather startling statement it is manifest that railroad companies. are not only justified in reducing their expenses, where it is practicable. to do so with reasonable regard to effi - ciency and without impairment of their absolute obligations, but that it is their duty to do so in the public interest." The Interstate Commerce Commission in granting the application of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. to abandon its line of railroad between Greeley Center and Erickson, Nebraska, April 11, 1940, Finance Docket No. 12486, among other things said: "The evidence shows that the line has been operated at a substantial loss for several years, and that there is no prospect of more favorable results in the future. Some of the opposition witnesses anticipate an improvement in the pros - perity of the tributary territory, but there is no assurance that ¦-¦/. traffic on the line will increase in -volume. On the other hand, much of the traffic formerly moved by the line is now handled by motor vehicles, and the small amount of traffic now handled can be moved by such vehicles without serious inconvenience to the public Under these circumstances, the rehabilitation and continued operation of the line would impose an undue burden upon the applicant and upon interstate commerce." In Kuni vn. State, (Okla.) 66 P. 2d 52 which involved curtailment of service on a railroad, the Supreme Court said: "The patronizing public, as a rule, have no right to demand conveniences without just compensation to the party furnish - ing the same. Neither an individual nor corporation, as a rule, can be required to furnish conveniences without just compen - sation, or at a loss to itself. ~ Chicago, R. I. &amp; J&gt;. R. R. Co. v. State, 24 Okl. 370, 103 P. 617, 24 L. R. A. (N. S.) 393. In ¦the case of In re Southern Pacific Company, 37 N. M. 11, 16 P. &lt;?d) 402, 406, it was pointed out that the federal statutes re - quire interstate carriers to operate their railroads efficiently and economically. The following language is found in the body of the opinion: " 'It is perfectly natural that every com - munity should aspire to the best railroad service to be had. We have full sympathy with such aspirations. Yet it is to be remembered that, under our system of public control of rates and services,: the general public, speaking broadly, loses in cost what it gains in service. So the railroad, in resisting </seg>
         <seg id="p102">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT demands for any uneconomic service, really represents the true interest of the general public' " Our own Supreme Court in the case of C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. vs. Commission, 138 Neb. 767, 293 N. M. 389, decided December 20, 1940, reversed an order of this Commission denying applicant authority to discontinue passenger train service between Holdrege and Beatrice, and among other things said: " * * * It is expecting too much of human nature,, of opti - mism, of forecasts for moisture, and of the proper attitude to - ward the railroad company, to find that trains 97 and 98, if con - tinued, will be substituted for automobiles in the transportation of passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege. Conditions of railroad transportation have changed since 1886, when this branch line was constructed, and the revenues during the entire intervening period are not proper measures of earnings and expenses tinder present changed conditions. Earnings and expenses sinces 1932, a period suggested by remonstrants for computations, are not proper measures of present or future profits and losses. Applicant must reckon with conditions result - ing in present losses." Representatives of the Big Four Railroad Brotherhoods were present throughout the hearing but did not testify. They did, however, file a pleading after the case was closed, identified as "Answer and Objec - tions", in whicli they generally allege that employees on the trains will be left without employment because of seniority rights and because they are over 50 years of age; the equipment used is obsolete and inappro - priate for use in national defense. We are of the opinion that Section 75-216, C. S. Neb. 1929 pre - cludes the Commission from considering employment relations between the railroad and the brotherhoods. In part that section reads as follows: " * * * It is further provided that nothing herein.contained shall be construed as giving the state railway commission juris - diction or control of the relations between the railway com - panies and their employers and employee's orders, either con - tractual or otherwise." Jurisdiction of the Commission in this instance is primarily con - cerned with adequate rail service to the shipping public.

         <seg id="p104">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING BY SWANSON, COMMISSIONER: This is an application of the Union Pacific R. R. Co., requesting authority to discontinue the operation of Motor Trains Nos. 503 and 504 between St. Paul and Lotip City, Nebraska. After due notice to the various towns along the branch, the matter came on for public hearing at 9:00 o'clock A. M. on the 16th day of October, 1941 in the District Court Room at St. Paul. The motor trains in question operate between the two towns on a turn-around schedule, Train No. 504 leaving Loup City, population 1675, daily except Sunday at 10:30 A. M. passing throuprh tb« towns of Austin (10), Rockville (223), Boelus (228), Kenyon (210), and Danne - brog (379) arriving at St. Paul (1571) at 11:55 A. M. Train No. 503 leaves St. Paul at 3:55 P. M. daily except Sunday, arriving Loup City at 5:15 P. M. The rail distance is 39 miles. Exhibit No. 6 offered by applicant and received in evidence, shows the actual number of man hours required to maintain, service and repair said cars, based on an eight hour day, and summarized at the bottom of the exhibit as follows: Skilled Employes : Unskilled Employes.: Total ~ Man Hrs.: Man Days :Man Hrs.:Man Days: Man Hrs^Man Days p er day 5.411 : .678 : 10.35 : 1.29 t 15.76 : 1.97 Per month 141.12 : 17.76 : 269.96 : 33.745 : 411.08 : 51.38 Per year 1693 : 212 : 3240 •. 405 : 4933 : 617 The total revenue credited to the trains from all sources, including freight, passenger, mail, express, milk, cream and newspapers for the jear 1940, amounted to $2,756.07. The actual out-of-pocket cost of operating the trains for the same year amounted to $9,999.96, resulting in an actual out-of-pocket loss of $7,243.89. Broken down further the operation resulted in a loss of 30.35 C for every mile operated during the year. During the first six months of 1941, the total reve - nue received from the operation of the trains was $1,336.23 and the out-of-pocket cost of operation was $5,319.99, or a net loss of $3,983.76.

         <seg id="p106">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT will be noted that the shipping public no longer is wholly dependent upon applicant to furnish passenger transportation service through the towns along this branch. In a recent similar application filed by the Burlington Railroad to abandon motor train service between Holdrege and Beatrice, the proof revealed a loss of some $500.00 a month. The Commission de - nied the application and upon appeal to the Supreme, Court of Nebraska in the case entitled C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Commission, 138 Neb. 767; 295 N. W. 389, decided December 20, 1940, the court reversed the Com - mission's order and among other tilings said: •• * * * i nc ome from passenger traffic, averaging less than two passengers per train mile, is out of all proportion to the cost of operation as shown by uncontradicted evidence. There is no public necessity for exclusive passenger trains operated as such without compensable revenue nor is there any com - petent probative evidence of a material increase. Witnesses " generally came to the hearing before the commission in private automobiles. They were prompted by natural impulses to do so. They preferred a convenient, speedy and comfortable way to travel on highways constructed and improved at public expense. They started from their own doors. They were not hampered by railroad time tables or limited in speed by motor trains or delayed by stops at stations. It is expecting too much of human nature, of optimism, of forecasts for mois - ture, and of proper attitude toward the railroad company, to find that trains 97 and 98, if continued, will be substituted for automobiles in the transportation of passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege. Conditions of railroad transporta - tion have changed since 1886, when this branch line was con - structed, and the revenues during the entire intervening period are not proper measures of earnings and expenses under pres- • ent changed conditions. Earnings and expenses since 1932, a period suggested by remonstrants for computations, are not proper measures of present or future profits and losses. Ap - plicant must reckon with conditions resulting in present losses. The slight decrease in the loss occasioned by the operation of &#132; the motor passenger trains in 1939 was due in part to: dis - missal of one member of a train crew. Neither the evidence nor the findings of the commission show a public necessity for trains 97 and 98 as means of transporting passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege, when the daily service, equipment and connecting links of trains 102 and 103 are considered with other available services of applicant and of other common carriers. </seg>
         <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Do the franchises and public duties of applicant require it to operate these passenger trains for the incidental pur - poses of transporting United States mails, express and cream? It is not a duty of a railroad common carrier to run passen - ger trains at heavy monthly losses for years on a branch line of railroad after such trains have been abandoned by the public for general and ordinary passenger traffic producing only, a small decimal of operating expenses, where adequate facilities and public services are provided by daily mixed-service trains carrying passengers, mail, express and frieght, and by other public utilities. Motor passenger trains operated on a branch line of a railroad at a loss may properly be discontinued, where adequate public transportation is otherwise furnished, though the main line is operated at a profit." Under all of the circumstances, and after a full and careful con - sideration of the testimony, exhibits and the court decisions, the Com - mission is. of the opinion that in the honest efficient and economical management of said railroad, said application should be granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the application of the Union Pacific Railroad Com - pany for authority to discontinue operation of Motor Trains Nos. 503 and 504 between St Paul and Loup City, Nebraska, be and the same is hereby granted, effective December 8. 1941.

Fleming, Trustees of the ) Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific &gt; Railway Company, a Corporation, ) Defendants. ) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This proceeding comes before the Commission upon formal com - piaint of Sarpy County, filed March 10, 1941. Complainant alleges that the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company's bridge No. 5189 located about \l/i miles southwest of Richfield (unincorpo - rated), Sarpy County, Nebraska, is in a deteriorated state of repair and should be replaced; that the bridge is out of alignment with the section line; that the bridge piers obstruct the vision of persons travelling the highway passing under said bridge and that the bridge is a traffic haz - ard, and "bottleneck." Complainant prays that the Commission or* der defendants to rebuild said bridge No. 5189 under the provisions of Sec. 75-220, C. S. of Nelir., 1929. The complaint was set for public hearing and due notice having been given, came on to be heard before the full Commission on May 14, 1941 at which time hearing was accorded all interested parties, tes - timony adduced and the matter was submitted upon the record. Briefs by complainant and defendants were subsequently filed. A personal inspection was made of the situation by the Commission This, matter was previously before the Commission as the second cause of action in F. C. No. 563, filed in 1926.

' The County of Sarpy, complainant herein has begun and carried forward an improvement program for the highway passing under the defendants' bridge complained of in this proceeding. Sarpy County proposes to improve said county highway from State highway No. SO west to U. S. highway No. 6, the latter being the main highway con - necting the cities of Lincoln and Omaha. ..: Mr. Otto Timm, witness for complainant, testified that the high - way had already been improved a distance of approximately two miles to the east of the underpass by grading the same to a width of 28 feet, and by surfacing the same with gravel. Immediately east of the underpass is a hill with a6to 7 percent grade in the highway. At the present time the travelled roadway deviates to the south from the section line in order to pass under defendants' bridge. The east and west section: line, which is the center line of the improved highway, passes through the north pier of the bridge. Defendants right-of-way does not intersect the highway at right angles, but r.ihs in a north - easterly and southwesterly direction so that the overhead bridge is diagonal to the highway. Vision of travelers along the highway is obstructed to some extent by the north pier of the bridge. Photo - graphs identified as Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4, show the roadway as it presently exists. : i ' .-. : ¦¦..'./.¦ The present underpass was probably erected at the time of the construction of the railroad. The structure jtselt bears the date 1899. It seems that the bridge was constructed over the highway as it then existed. Transportation facilities have changed greatly since 1899. Motor vehicles have come into general use and transportation speed has been greatly increased. In order to provide for the much greater speed, both highways and railroads have been improved and straighten - ed and grades reduced.: : . •;.

         <seg id="p110">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT pair and there is no argument as to the location of the bridge piers with respect to the section line. Defendants included in their 19*1 budget the sum of $6,673.00 for repair and reconstruction of the bridge. Several separate traffic counts of vehicles passing through the underpass have been made. Sarpy County officials made a traffic count on Saturday, March 29, 1941 between 8:00 A. M. and 9:00 P. M. resulting as follows: 77 pleasure cars, 42 trucks and 2 horse-drawn vehicles, a total of 121. Another check by the County on Thursday, May 8, \&lt;H\ between 6:00 A. M. and 11:00 P. M., resulted as follows: 161 pleasure cars, 100 trucks, 33 pedestrians, one tractor and one horse-drawn vehicle. Thirty-two of the above trucks were trips made by Sarpy County vehicles hauling gravel for road construction east of the bridge. There was also a Softball game at Richfield that night. Defendants made traffic counts as follows: September 28, 1940, Saturday, 115 automobiles, including trucks and one pedestrian. September 29, 1940, Sunday, 264 automobiles, including trucks and 6 pedestrians. September 30, 1940, Monday, 147 automobiles, including trucks, 27 pedestrians and two teams. February 8, 1941, Saturday, 137 automobiles, including 7 county-owned gravel trucks. February 9, 194J, Sunday, 177 automobiles, including 44 county-owned gravel trucks. February 10, 1941, Monday, 245 automobiles, including 98 county-owned gravel trucks, and 18 pedestrians. ¦ . The traffic count submitted at the first hearing was as follows: May 15, 1926, Saturday, 215 automobiles, including trucks; May 17, 192b, Monday, 182 automobiles, including trucks; and May 19, .1926, Wednesday, 178 automobiles, including trucks. Complainant was not prepared to submit plans for changes in the bridge structure. It was complainant's contention that the bridge should be replaced by a wider span and relocated across the center line o{ the highway wholly at defendants' expens-e: that the county was financially unable to assist. This latter situation was important to both parties. Defendants submitted several plans for the recon - struction of the bridge. These plans were offered in evidence and are embodied in Exhibits Nos. 7to 13, inclusive. Plan No. 1 covers the plan of reconstruction as originally set up by the defendants and included in their 1941 budget. This plan provides for the cutting off of the corners of the existing abutments, thereby allowing greater clearance between abutments but requires a slight reverse curve on either side of the bridge, in order that the roadway may pass under the bridge at right angles. The plan does not meet with the approval of the complainant. The county's objections to Plan No. 1 are based primarily upon the curve on either side of the bridge and the fact that the underpass is located at the bottom of the hill. </seg>
         <seg id="p111">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Defendants' Flan No. 2 provides for the rebuilding of the bridge to the north of its present site and centered on the section line. This plan would give a clearance for a 24-foot roadway through the under - pass and requires the construction of a new bridge. Defendants' estimate of the cost of the new bridge under this plan is $22,646.0(1. Defendants object to constructing the bridge outlined in this plan because of the cost thereof, and allege that such a bridge is not neces - sary under the circumstances. Defendants' witness Korsell, stated on direct examination that the additional investment required would provide protection for three or four other highway crossings la the state. ; ¦-.-;¦ '-; '"•¦' ;¦¦., ¦;¦.' •¦' -.' .': - / ¦¦' .".':'•'... Defendants' Plan No. 3 is similar to Plan No. 2, except that it provides a 20-foot roadway clearance. This plan would require a 42-foot "I" beam span, whereas Flan N0.;2 would require a 50-font steel girder. Plan No. 3 also contemplates the removal ot the exist - ing structure and the construction of a new bridge centering on thq section line. The construction cost for Plan No. 3as estimated by the defendants, would be $18,579.00. Another plan was suggested by Assistant Attorney General Kokjer during the hearing. This plan proposes the construction of two new concrete piers to be placed north of the present pier locations, so that the highway might traverse a. straight course along the section line.. The plan would utilize the present 33-foot steel girders. Mr, Dougall, construction engineer for defendants, testified that the esti - mated construction cost of this plan would amount to $15,495.00. If the bridge were constructed in accordance with this plan the highway would.have a lateral clearance of 18-fcet through the underpass, ac - cording to Mr. Dougall's testimony. '"-; . ; .

         <seg id="p112">THIRTY-KOURTH ANNUAL REPORT (c) Exhibit 10 (d) Transcript, P. 141 The Commission in arriving at a decision in this matter must give consideration to the practicability, advantages, disadvantages, and cost of each of the plans submitted. Public convenience and neces - sity of the structural improvement requested by complainant must also be given due consideration. Defendants contend that the repair and reconstruction of the bridge as set forth in its Plan No. 1 is the extent of its limited finan - cial possibility, and that the need, if there is a need, of greater lateral clearance through the underpass comes about because of the growth and use of competing modes of transportation and that defendants already having a bridge suitable for their purposes end operations, should not be compelled at the defendants' sole expense to erect a structure which would inure chiefly to the benefit of competitors. . The above contention is substantiated by the case of Nashville, C &amp; St. L. R. Co. v. Walters, 294 U. S. 405, which holds in part as follows: "First. Unless the evidence and the special facts relied upon were o{ such a nature that they could not conceivably establish that the action of the State in imposing upon the Railway one-half of the cost of the underpass was arbitrary and unreasonable, the Supreme Court obviously erred in re - fusing to consider them. The charge of arbitrariness is based primarily upon the revolutionary changes incident to trans - portation wrought in recent years by the widespread intro - duction of motor vehicles; the assumption by the Federal Government of the functions of road builder; the resulting depletion of rail revenues; the change in the character, the construction and the use of highways; the change in the occasion for elimination of grade crossings, in the purpose of such elimination, and in the chief beneficiaries thereof; and the change in the relative responsibility of the railroads and vehicles moving on the highways as elements of danger and " causes of accidents. The facts specifically found, or of which the courts could take judicial notice, are these:**** "Lexington is a rural community of 1823 inhabitants lo - cated in a sparsely settled territory. The construction of the new highway with the underpass were not designated to meet local transportation needs." The relative cost of the various plans should be given serious </seg>
         <seg id="p113">. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION consideration. The United States Supreme Court in the case of Atchison T. ft S. F. R. Co. v. Railroad Commitrion, 283 U. S. 380 stated with respect thereto, in part, as follows: "The question in each case is whether, in the light of facts disclosed, the regulation is essentially an unreasonable one. * * * and the matter of expense is an important criterion to be taken into view in determining the reasonableness of the order." : The expressions of our own Supreme Court, in the case of Sarpy Comity v. Omaha and S. I. R. Co., 116 Neb. 516, are in entire con - currence and accord with our own views in the instant case. The Court in speaking of structures provided at intersections of public mghways and railroad lines, said: , "While the above quoted statute apparently makes it the duty of the railway company to make and keep in repair good and sufficient crossings wherever its tracks are crossed by a public road, we think a proper interpretation of the statute requires us to consider the purpose and object of such legis - lation. Clearly, it was intended to provide a safe and ade - quate means for the public to cross the tracks of a railroad wherever public necessity or convenience would require it. Certainly, it was not the purpose to compel the construction and maintenance of costly bridges or viaducts where they would be of no use to the public, and where they would not serve the public convenience. If any other view were taken, it would require a vain and useless expenditure of large sums of money by railway companies to make and keep in good repair, crossing of this character. Railroads are entitled to make such charges for their services, a* common carriers, as will bring in an income sufficient to pay the cost of operation, • maintenance and a reasonable return upon the investment. These charges must be borne by the patrons of the common carrier. In the last analysis the cost or expense of such cross - ings must be borne by the public. *? * Fairly interpreted, the statute/was intended to require the construction of cross - ings over highways when, and'only when, public necessity or convenience would be subserved thereby." In Butler County v. Chicago ft N. W. Ry. Co., 130 Neb. 75. the Supreme Court sustained this Commission's order dismissing a com - plaint in a similar situation, and among other things said: "The evidence shows that the road on which the under - pass complained of was located was neither a federal road nor </seg>
         <seg id="p114">THIRTY-KOURTH ANNUAL REPORT a state road; it was approximately in the center of a valley and approached by a straight road, visible and dropping down the vailey to it, for about 1,500 feet both from the west and the east; the road had not long been graded and it had been graveled for the first time shortly before the trial; the underpass had a lateral clearance of 17 feet and 3 inches, compared with 18 feet lateral clearance of the underpass on federal highway No. 16, which the commission was asked to consider. The underpass in suit is used by few people compared with that of No. 16; photographs in evidence show a sufficiently long view of ihe road, when approaching the underpass, to protect any one driving with due care, and show that two vehicles so driven could easily pass at the point in question. The evidence shows that there was no danger of collision of a car on the highway and one coming out of the private driveway, 120 feet from the underpass, if both were being driven with due care. "The underpass was first built in 1913. In 1927 new creo - sote-ireated piles were put in. It would cost approximately $4,500 to build an underpass with 28 feet clearance." Under the facts, circumstances, and the decisions hereinabovc re - ferred to. the Commission is of the opinion that said complaint should be dismissed. It would appear, however, that this would be a wonder - ful opportunity for the county officials and the railroad officials to agree upon a bridge of joint construction whereby the present underpass could be eliminated, and the railroad could at the same time repair and reconstruct its bridge. The statutes of Nebraska provide for such pro - cedure, and further provide that in the event the parties are unable tc agree upon the proportionate share of the cost that their problem should then be submitted to this Commission. In the instant case, however, ¦we have not been called upon to proportion the cost, the case having •been submitted under Sec. 75-220, which relates soleiy to hazardous crossings.

COMMISSIONER GOOD DISSENTING: Opinion preceding this plainly proves that the underpass was not in its first construction properly located, nor has there been any re - adjnstment made in the intervening years. Said structure erected in 1899 was distinctly of the Horse, wagon and pedestrian age. Estimating horse buggy and wagon speeds at from 2 to 7 miles per hour and that of adult and child pedestrians at 2 to 3 miles per hour; it migh* then &lt;1899) have been and was considered as a tolerated nuisance, despite the fact that there was a limited vision from either approach to said underpass; , ¦.";.¦',-'.- From 1899 a series of changed events portray a very different picture. By state law, motor vehicles may 1; move 60 miles per hour by day and 50 miles per hour at night, which is approximately ten (10) times the 1899 horse speed; as a matter of fact, the traffic count of horse movement under this structure was exceeded by motor vehicles by 265 times. From a summary of said traffic count, i. c, 3 days of February, 1941, 1 day of March, 1 day of May, and 3 days of Septem - ber, 1940, indicates that some 1,467 motor propelled vehicles, five horse - drawn vehicles and 85 pedestrians went through this underpass, thus the average per day for the 8 days of traffic count was pleasure cars and trucks, 183; pedestrians, 10.5; horse-drawn, 5/Bth of one. This statistical matter strikingly indicates the very decisive changed con - dition of, highway traffic. To hold that a crumbling structure set at a sharp diagonal to the highway and so far off center of the road as to involve a series of reverse curves and obscuring visions of approach from either side, to hold that such a structure is adaptable to safety of modern highway traffic when clearance is but a matter of feet in the curve of the highway is retroactive logic identified with the horse and buggy age now a matter of history. Again I cannot agree that motor vehicular traffic averaging 183 units per day is of negligible character as set forth by respondent. This highway is so well travelled that the County Commissioners have proceeded to rebuild and regravel said highway from the east to a point near said underpass and await only the improvement by the rails as instanced in the application to carry through the project now held </seg>
         <seg id="p116">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT up for the obvious reason herein set forth. It is indicated by witnesses that at present vehicles approach said underpass at a much reduced rate of speed. If, immediately before entering, a glimpse may indicate another vehicle approaching from opposite direction, then one gives way for the other to pass through first for by personal inspection it would hazard mud guards and tem - per for cars to meet directly under said underpass. The cutting off of corners of the abutment, as proposed by the rail company, would make possible the passing of two vehicles if negotiated by very care - ful driving. The planting of such bottlenecks on tin's or any other highway should be, and undoubtedly would, be denied in this motor vehicle age. The contention that because the public has endured this situation for 42 years, despite their (the public) efforts to effect a change, should have little weight in this case. Some 14 years ago the public asked, and was granted, a hearing on what, is now an instant matter. At that time, a company engineer testified that the then present struc - ture would be serviceable for 10 more years. A casual inspection by this Commissioner would indicate that the engineer's life expec - tancy was liberal. It appears the company's contention that the expense incident to modernizing the structure is not warranted because it would be im - proving the highway for a competitor cannot be taken seriously. A very lange percentage of tracks using said highway were conveying road making material, even to making a better-surfaced road to the very approach of this underpass. With better roadway, then doubt - less more travel would develop. It is notable that many railroads now use their own truck service, appreciating that where economic situations warrant, they too get into the truck business. Let me indicate that I am in accordance with the matter set forth in the first four pages of said opinion. When I find from making a computation of traffic count in May of 1941 that on an eight day average 183 motor vehicles, including trucks, that 10.5 pedestrians and that one horse-drawn vehicle passed through this underpass, from this survey, I cannot appreciate respondent's allegations which appear to be buttressed by the opinion I herein cited that traffic using this underpass is of very negligible character. Testimony ot the party making said traffic count was to the effect that practically all vehicles using said underpass due to the curve of said road incident to the bridge being on the south side of the center of the road, thus necessi - tating a curve, that the vehicles using said underpass nearly all moved through close to the north side of said abutments, thus increasing the hazard already established by a clearance of approximately only 16 </seg>
         <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION feet. ;¦'¦; - ..• :..:. ¦;. ¦ .¦ ¦¦-¦';. ¦&#132; , ' Further, a matter of record that evidence of a company engineer adduced some 15 years ago, was that the underpass was not in A-l condition but might give service for an additional 10 years. At the present time the abutments have remained in service 5 years oxer the engineer's stated limitations, and there is visible evidence of ma - terial disintegration. Let me further say that I have given careful attention to the court decisions that have been re/erredto by J,fr. Swanson, witlh the follow - ing results: . . ¦..;¦ The first citation instanced is of Naihvtlle, C. &amp; St. L. R Co v Waltert, 294 U. S. 405, which I hold to be immaterial in the present instance as there exists no analogous situation. In this said citation i find that the applicant seeks-to establish a new underpass on a pro - posed federal highway to separate the grades of its main line; that it had no local significance that said highway was being designed for high speed motor traffic and was to be a federal aid highway largely planned, financed, and designed by the federal government. From the local standpoint there was no need of grade separation, that 'he underpass was prescribed not upon consideration of local safety needs, that the highway if constructed would be a greater source of danger than now existed in the town of Lexington, Tennessee where the allo - cation would be made. It was cited by the U. S. Court that in the years 1931, 1932, and 1933 the sum of $11,063,325 was appropriated for federal highway aid and that the said highway under construction would be a main high speed road between Nashville and Memphis and for these reasons the federal court held that the railway affected should not be penalized by paying one half of the total construction. The cost of said underpass was estimated at $17,400. The federal court in its opinion, Section 6, sets forth the loss of passenger and IXL freight due to through competition as lending some color to their overruling an order of the Federal Service Commission. Let me say that this changed,, and yet changing, phase of transportation is a wholly natural economic development, and while I can appreciate discomforture of the rails, it would not appear that'the rails' obliga - tion to the public as to safety and public convenience was thereby eliminated even in part. Quoting from Section 7of said U. S Supreme Court decision, "It is also true that state action imposing - upon a railroad the cost of eliminating a dangerous grade crossing of an existing structure may be valid though it appears that the improve - ment benefits commercial highway users who make no contribution to its cost. (C. B. &amp;Q. 170 V. S. 5775) That a railroad has no constitutional immunity from having to contribute to the safe guard - ing of a crossing." -;. </seg>
         <seg id="p118">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT As relates to the Atahison T. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. Railroad Com - mission, 283 U. S. 380 citation, may we say that it is quite hard to find any analogy between the situation therein set forth and the one, under our consideration at the moment. The matter instanced had to do with the Commission order to the said railway company to «rect a passenger depot at Los Angeles at an estimated expense of 10 million dollars. As relates to the case cited of Sarpy County v. Omaha and S. I R. Co., 116 Neb. 516, the court said, "Certainly it is not the .purpose to compel the construction and maintenance of the crossings, bridges, or viaducts where they would be of no use to the public and where they would not serve the public convenience." In the instant case for our disposition it would appear very positively from testimony that this underpass was a convenience to the public and further that there was an unsafe condition not only as relates to the public haz arding themselves by this bottleneck of the highway but from casual observations, the underpass is a crumbling structure. As to Butler County v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 130 Nebr. 75, as relates to the underpass there is evidence that a long view of the highway was obtained by motorists approaching from either direction and that safety was assured if both vehicles were traveling with care. It is interesting to quote the concluding paragraph of this de - cision, "The underpass was first built in 1913. In 1925 new creosoted piles were put in. It would cost approximately $4,500 to build an underpass with 28 foot clearance." This figure of $4,500 a2B foot clearance underpass is in striking contradistinction with the allegation that in the instant structure it wouM cost approximately $22,646 to build an underpass with a 24 foot clearance as instanced by said esti - mate of the railway company affected. From a cursory examination of federal and state citations wherein hundreds of highway crossing cases are cited, it is a matter of signifi - cance that no citations were found indicating that either federal or state courts or commission decisions have been used to set forth that safety and convenience of the public should be subordinated because admitted correction of fault would necessitate expenditure of main - tenance funds. It is a matter of moment to note that in none of the citations instanced, has a court found a situation in any sense analogous to the existing underpass, i. c., a narrow structure off side the highway and at an acute oblique angle thereto, and where oncoming visions was distinctively impaired and the piers of the underpass in disintegrating condition, all of which obtains in the instant matter. </seg>
         <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION SUMMARY (1) The underpass is out of line with the highway. (2) Curves incident to getting into and out of the underpass dc not conform to modern highway construction. (3) The deterioration of the present structure warrants immediate attention. : . (4) Even if underpass might be centered over highway yet the dear - ; ance between piers would be grossly inadequate. Clipping off corners as suggested by company on such a narrow pavement as instanced would be very bad engineering practice. (5) The company having budgeted a limited amount, i. c., $6,673.00 does not preclude their possibility or necessity for expending an adequate sum for highly essential maintenance, regardless of the amount budgeted. ¦ .'.;'. After discussing the citations given which I hold to be irrelevant to the instant case, even if a strained construction were given to the court's wording, lam making one citation of conclusiveness. I quote from Corpus Juris, 51 C. J., P. 649: "Crossings: Railway and Highway. : ."".•¦ . .... And it has no right so to construct and use it as injuriously to affect the public traffic over the highway." Note that the right of the railway over the highway is a right of passage with the reasonable incidents of passage, nothing more. For the said reasons herein set forth which I think wholly per - tinent.to the instant matter, I cannot sense that justice can or could be served by a dismissal of the application. (Signed) F. A.

Until the Southeast Nebraska oil fields were discovered the state of Nebraska was entirely dependent upon fuel, supplies produced in other states and shipped to our con - sumer from coat mines, refineries, or gas wells in Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, lowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming; At first, Nebraska crude petroleum was. shipped to a refinery at Omaha for conversion into marketable petroleum products. Refineries were constructed at Falls City and Salem, Nebraska, in the heart of the Southeast Nebraska oil fields. They were completed and com - menced operation in the closing days of the year 1940. At the time these, refineries began production of commercial petroleum products the only freight rates applicable, for railroad transportation of petro - leum products from Salem and Falls City to Nebraska consuming points, were the first-class carload merchandise rates -which were and are generally at least double the "commodity" basis of carload rates on petroleum products applicable to either state or interstate shipments of petroleum products from refineries, pipe line or marine terminals for equal distances. . / .

Tiit railroads serving Falls City and Salem, together with their connections, were able to transport petroleum products to all consum - ing points in the state of Nebraska, but had no rates applicable to tank car movements which would permit and encourage such distribution and, at the same time, published rates applicable to motor vehicle com - mon carriers of petroleum products were in effect on a basis which would permit such distribution and marketing of petroleum products by the new refineries, but there were no adequate motor vehicle com - mon carrier facilities able to carry on the large scale transportation ot these products from Fulls City and Salem to Nebraska consuming points. To meet this emergency situation and establish commodity rates on petroleum products where none were then in effect, Nebraska Rail - roads filed their Application No. 14559 on January 2, 1941. This ap - plication requested authority to establish the proposed rates "at the earliest possible date", and proposed the publication ctf "truck com - petitive rates" to apply to tank-carload shipments of petroleum pro - ducts defined in the application as follows: ''Rates to apply only on Blended gasoline, viz.: Motor fuels containing 50% or more gasoline; fuel oil distil - late, not suitable for illuminating purposes; gasoline (except casing-head (natural) gasoline); naptha; re - fined oil; illuminating or burning;" The proposed rates were based on the distance from Falls City and Salem to twenty Nebraska destinations representing the largest centers of population in this state and' scattered over a territory in - cluding a maximum distance of 226 miles from the refineries to Hold - rege, Nebraska. The Nebraska State Railway Commission found that an emergency existed which justified and required fhe immediate estab - lishment of the proposed rates. An order was entered on January 2. 1941, requiring the application of the proposed rates on and after that date. The Salem and Falls City refineries found that their principal products are relatively low-grade fuel oils with a very small proportion of high-grade, high-volatile products such as gasoline and napthi Die refineries found it necessary to sell and ship relatively large quantities of a product known as residual fuel oil. The description of petroleum products to which carload rates published from Falls City and Salem were applicable included the commodity, among others, described as "Fuel Oil, distillate (not suitable for illuminating purposes):" A con- </seg>

If the descrip - tion of "Fuel Oil, distillate, etc," was not to be construed as including residual mcl oil, shipments of that commodity would be required to pay rates from 50 to 100% higher than the rates on gasoline, kerosene, distillate, or other fuel oils applicable from Falls City and Salem to any of die twenty points to which rates had been established effective January 2nd. To settle this controversy, the Commission issued a further emer - gency order in Supplement No. 2 to Application 14559 which required the amendment of the description of petroleum products governing rates applicable from Falls City and Salem to read, "Fuel Oil, residual and/or distillate not suitable tor illuminating purposes" to become ef - fective February 4, 1941, and to continue in force for a period of 60 days "pending such hearings and further order or orders as may become necessary in the premises." . . ¦ On February 21, 1941, Acting Secretary Viren mailed notices to all Nebraska railroads and to interested shippers that a hearing would be held on March 17, 1941 at 10:00; A. M. to consider the question whether the Commission's emergency order of February 4, 1941 in Supplement No. 2 to Application 14559 shall continue in effect after the expiration of the 60 day period provided therein. . On February 21, 1941, the Nebraska State Railway Commission entered its resolution and order herein which instituted an investi - gation concerning the lawfulness of carload rates on petroleum pro - ducts, including Fuel Oil, residual and distillate from Falls City and Salem, Nebraska to some ninety named destinations, including the twenty cities and towns to which rates were already in effect as provid - ed by Application 14559, as supplemented. The resolution recites the history of, carload rates on petroleum products, as approved or prescribed in Application. 14559 and Supple - ments 1 and 2 thereto, which has been heretofore cited insofar as neces - sary to our present purposes. The hearing set for March 17, 1941 involving Application 14559, and especially Supplement 2 thereto is recited and the investigation herein was assigned for simultaneous* hearing therewith. .. : : ;¦'.:•¦¦• Our resolution and order of inquiry herein raises two principal questions which may be thus stated: </seg>
         <seg id="p124">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT I. Shall respondents be required to define petroleum products, for the purpose of applying tank-carload rates on those commodities from Falls City and Salem, Ne - braska to Nebraska destinations as follows: Blended gasolines, Viz: Motor fuels containing 50% or more gasoline; Fuel Oil, residual or distillate, not suitable for illuminating purposes; Gasoline, (except casinghead (natural) gasoline; Naptha; Refined oil, illuminating or burning? 2. Shall respondents be required to publish rates on tank carloads of commodities described in 1 above from Salem and Falls City to points in Nebraska, shown in appendix A to Resolution IS3, no higher than those set forth therein? From the foregoing statement it will be seen that the investigation instituted in Resolution 153 includes all the issues raised in Supplement 2 to Application 14559 and the question whether respondents shall be required to establish carload commodity rates on pet - roleum to seventy additional Nebraska destinations and revise the rates to the twenty points to which rates are now in effect, on some basis which will be harmoni - ous, as to the entire ninety points involved herein. Hearings were held, as ordered, on March 17th and 18th, 1941. Evidence was offered by respondents, the interested refineries, consumers and the state of Nebraska. It was understood and agreed by all par - ties that the evidence adduced was received as to the issues raised in both Application 14559 and Resolu - tion 153. Early in the course of our hearing we were con - fronted by the contention that rates on petroleum pro- 124 </seg>

Chap.-74-815 -which published a schedule of rates applicable to shipments of residual fuel oil or crude petroleum for various distances. The affected Ne - braska refineries contend, on brief, tViat the prescrip- '¦' tion of rates on petroleum products, as defined in the statute, by the Legislature is binding on the respon - dents and has stripped the Commission of its power to consider the issues herein, on the merits, and reach an independent conclusion on the evidence submitted. We shall first consider and dispose of this important '¦¦:.¦ controversy. . EFFECT OF SECTIONS 74-815 AND 74-816. C, S. 1929 Section 74-815, Compiled Statutes, 1929, was challenged to the at - tention o{ the Commission. By this section it was made unlawful ior a common carrier by rail to charge more than the scale of rates therein set forth for the transportation of residual fuel oil or crude petroleum between points in Nebraska. Section 74-816 Compiled Sta - tutes,. 1929, provides penalties for violations. The statute, if valid, would undoubtedly deprive this Commission of any jurisdiction to act with regard to the subject matter involved in the present proceeding. It: would constitute specific legislation such as is reserved to the legislature under Section 20, Article IV of the constitution of Nebraska, and would also be within the power of the legislature as establishing a maximum schedule for freight rates under Section 4, Article IX of the constitution of Nebraska.

This.statute has been carried in our Compiled Statutes ever since 1909, when it was enacted as House Roll No. 358, but it has been en - tirely disregarded by the railroads ever since its passage, and no lates have ever been published responding to or in compliance with its teims, It is our understanding that the failure of the carriers to cbmply.with the statute was intentional and was the result of a definite conclusion arrived at after the close of the 1909 session, and an ex - amination of the journals of the legislature chronicling the steps taken in the attempted enactment of said House Roll. As originally intro - duced it prescribed maximum ratts for the transportation of "Fuel oil </seg>
         <seg id="p126">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT or crude petroleum, in cans, barrels, tanks or tank cars". These same words were contained in the engrossed bill as passed by the house. The ivord "residuum" was inserted before the words "fuel oil" in the above description, and the words "cans, barrels, tanks or tank cars" stricken out, and the words "in carload lots* inserted by amendments duly adopted in the senate, as shown by the Senate Journal for the I'HY) session, at page 1302. The Senate Journal shows the committee amendments sent to the printer, reported from the Sifting Committee for consideration, considered in the Committee as the Whole, ordered to third reading and amendments engrossed. 11 fur - ther shows the bill read the third time and passed by the senate with the amendments (Senate Journal, page 1486). It was signed by the president of the senate (Senate Journal, page 1580), was returned to the house with advice "passed" (Senate Journal, page 1499). The house concurred in the senate amendments and returned the bill to the senate (House Journal, pages 917, 920, 956, Senate Journal, 1 page i 506). On April 2nd it was reported accordingly enrolled, signed by the speaker and chief clerk (House Journal, page 940), and approved by the governor on April 3rd (House Journal, page 963). The enrolled bill, however, presented to and signed by the governor, omits entirely the words "in carload lots" which were contained in the bill when it was passed by the senate, and were contained in the senate amend - ments which were concurred in by the house. Under those circumstances it is quite apparent that the bill at - tempted to be approved by the governor was not the bill passed by the legislature. In many stales, after a bill has been enrolled and signed by the governor, it is conclusively presumed to be in the same form as passed In- the legislature and no inquiry is permitted which would go back to the certificate appended to the enrolled bill which is presented to the governor for signature. This, however, is not the rule in Nebraska. 11 has long been determined that the certificate of the presiding of - ficer of the legislative body affords the only prima facie evidence, and that resort may be had to the journals of the legislature in order to ascertain what the bill actually contained when it passed that body. The leading case is the case of State ex reL Huff vs. McLelland, 18 Neb. 236. The facts in the case are thus stated by the Court: "At the last session of the legislature an act was passed by both branches of the legislature creating the office o! register of deeds in counties having not less than fifteen thousand inhabitants. The bill was then en - rolled, and the enrolled bill, properly certified by the presiding officers and chief clerks of each house, was </seg>
         <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION duly presented to the governor, and by him approved. In the bill that passed the legislature the number of inhabitants in a county entitled to a register of deeds is expressed in figures '15,000. In the bill as enrolled the number given is '1,500.' Laws 1885, Ch. 41, Comp. Stat, Ch. 18, sees. 77a-d. It will thus be seen that the bill providing for a register of deeds in the coun - ties having 15,000 or more inhabitants was never pre - sented to or approved by the governor, while the bill actually approved was not passed by either house. The question for determination is, i» ihe enrolled bill, as certified by the presiding officers of both" branches of the legislature and approved by the governor, the : exclusive evidence of what the law is? Or can the • court inquire whether the alleged act was in fact pass - ed and is a valid law?" The determination of flic Court is reflected in the syllabus, which is as follows: . . ; .. . .-. . "The certificate of the presiding officer of a branch : : of the legislature that a bill has duly passed the house over which he presides is merely prima facie evidence of the fact, and evidence may be received to ascer- ''. tain whether or not the bill actually passed. ¦ : "The journals of the respective houses are records of the proceedings therein, and if it should appear from .. them that a bill had not actually passed, the presump - tion in favor.*-of-.'-the certificate would be overthrown and the act declared invalid." ; ; The rule laid down in State ex. ret Huff v.

' . '*': </seg>
         <seg id="p128">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Some question would ordinarily arise as to what would be the duty of this Commission under these circumstances. Our Supreme Court has said that an unconstitutional act is as ineffectual as though it had never been passed. Boales v. Ferguson, 55 Neb. 565. It creates no - new rights and abrogates no old ones. Finders v. Bodle, 58 Neb. 57. And again that it confers no right, imposes no duty and affords na protection. State v. Several parcels of land, 78 Neb. 708. Nevertheless, all statutes are presumed to be validly passed. There is a presumption of constitutionality and an administrative tribunal like our own is extremely loath to declare an act of the legislature null and void. Ordinarily this should be left to the courts rather than assumed by this tribunal. Our Supreme Court, however, has made a distinction between an. ordinary case of unconstitutionality of a statute and a case like the instant one where it is apparent from the journals of the legislature that the paper which found its way to the governor's desk was not in fact an enrolled bill properly reflecting the action of the legislature. Such a situation was before our Supreme Court in the case of State ex rel. Morton v. Stevenson, 18 Neb. 416. The holding of the Court is expressed in the third paragraph of the syllabus which is - as follows: "There is a wide difference between the weight and authority to be accorded and given to an act which has passed the legislature by a constitutional majority and through all stages of legislation, and been approved by the executive, although it may be inimical to some provision of the constitution, and a paper which, with - out having passed the legislature has through accident or design, found its way to a place among the authen - ticated statutes. The former should be respected and obeyed until declared invalid by the judiciary in a proper legal proceeding, while the latter may be dis - regarded by all." (Blackface type ours.) Accordingly, we have much the less hesitancy in determining that the statute in question is invalid and should be disregarded and we so find. We also act with less hesitancy because the statute bears in itself many infirmities which undoubtedly would lead to its condem - nation b&gt; any court on the ground that it is not only unreasonable, but confiscatory. As it stands on our statute books it would apply not only to carload shipments, but also to L.C.L. shipments. It contains no provisions as to how the commodities affected shall be contained, </seg>
         <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION and it would apply as well to a five gallon can of gasoline as to an entire tank car. It contains no minimum weights and makes no al - lowance either for proper shipment of the commodity with regard to safety to the public or -with regard to lower rates for volume shipments. Again the scale of progression conforms to no known scale adopted by any carrier with regard to any commodity so far as the experience of this Commission is able to testify. It commences with the rate for a single; line haul of 2.5* per hundred pounds for a distance of six miles and less. It increases to 7.5* at the 100 mile mark, but it only advances 1.5* up to 200 miles, and .2.5* tip to 250 miles, arriving at a rate, for example, to Holdrege, Nebraska, a distance of 226 miles from Falls City and Salem, of 10*. This is to be compared with a rate of 19* under the Kansas intrastate scale for a similar distance. We feel quite sure that it would be impossible to justify the statutory scale under any known principles of rate making. ¦.'¦'"¦;: , In view of the invalidity of Ch. 74-815 as a basis for prescription of rates on petroleum products we are free to now deal with the issues herein on their merits. . . ..''•¦';. We shall first consider, the definition of commodities to be in - cluded in the term petroleum products, to which the rates to be herein - after prescribed shall apply. \ Respondents offered voluminous testimony intended to show that they are meeting keen competition in the transportation of petroleum products, in Nebraska and between points in neighboring states and Nebraska, by petroleum products transport trucks operated by com - mon and contract carriers and by shippers or receivers of this com - modity. Such competition between the railroads and various operators of highway vehicles has been especially keen as the "high volatile" petroleum products of which gasoline, kerosene, and distillate are typi - cal. Such competition involves transportation of petroleum products irom refineries in Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming and from pipe line and marine terminals in Nebraska, at Superior and Omaha-Council Bluffs, to points in Nebraska. Pipe lines and barges have been de - voted primarily to the movement of the high volatile petroleum pro - ducts, such as gasoline, kerosene and distillate, and little or no icsi - dual petroleum fuel oil has been received by pipeline or by water, in barges, at. Superior and Omaha for storage and subsequent shipment to consuming points in Nebraska. In a recent year the respondent Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad received for transportation only one carload of residual or crude petroleum at Nebraska points on its line* as compared with several thousand carloads of the Jiigh-vola - tile petroleum products which are the subject of competition Irom pipe Jine and marine terminals to consuming points. The description of commoditie* "petroleum products" as applied to such a situation might </seg>
         <seg id="p130">THrRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT omit the residual fuel oils without complaint because that commodity was not available and o/fered for transportation from the pipe line or marine terminals at Superior and Omaha-Council Bluffs. The record shows that when the Nebraska lines proposed reductions in rates on petroleum products from Omaha and Council Bluffs to Nebraska points to meet truck competition, in Western Trunk Line Application X-D-34-412, the railroad proponents defined the commodity involved, as follows: Fuel Oil viz.; Residual and/a distillate, not suitable for illuminating purposes; Gas oil; Gasoline (except casinghead (natural) gasoline); Naptha; Refined Oil, viz.: illuminating or burning; When this application was approved by the Western Trunk Line Committee the word "residual" was omitted from the description, as submitted to us for approval of the proposed reduced rates in Applica - tion 141 IS originally from Omaha and later-from Superior to points in Nebraska. For many years the commodity description governing shipments from Superior included the "residual" fuel oil, but no ship - ments of that commodity were made because it was not available for shipment from Superior. The omission of residual fuel oil from the rate application from Superior and Omaha did not affect the move - ment of that commodity from either point of origin to points in Ne - braska. We therefore conclude that the omission of residual fuel oil from the Superior-Omaha rate application on petroleum products was justified because that commodity was not offered for transportation from the pipe line and marine terminals at those points and the rates a* published did fully cover the commodities actually moving. The record shows that for many years past the Kansas lines of railroads, some of whom are respondents herein, have voluntarily pro - vided sor the movement of residual fuel oil at rates no higher than those published for movement of gasoline, kerosene, and distillate. It further appears that, in connection with the first general reduc - tions of Kansas rates on petroleum products, in tank cars, to meet motor carrier competition, the Kansas railroads provided rates on residual fuel oil eighty per cent of the rates on gasoline, kerosene, and distillate. Nearly two years ago the Kansas railroads published fur - ther reductions in rates on petroleum products to meet motor carrier competition. Such rates are about the same as Nebraska rates for </seg>
         <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION hauls of 100 miles or less and are lower than Nebraska rales by as much as 2or 3 cents per cwt. for some of the longer hauls. These Kansas rates apply to a group of petroleum products described as follows: . , . . ' PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, via.': Absorption Oil Blended Gasolines (Sec Note): . NOTE:—The term "Blended Gasolines" as used in this item covers Motor Fuels containing SO per cent or more of gasoline.

Niptha, ;.--'¦ ': ¦ :-.. '' ¦ : /¦. :;'¦ .; " ¦ ' ;-\ Kefined Oil, viz.: illuminating or burning. . It will be seen that the ICansas commodity description, which ap - pjies ifOm the various refineries in that state to all destinations in Kansas, is practically identical with the description of petroleum pro - ducts which has applied from Falls City and Salem, Nebraska, to the 20 destinations to which commodity rates are in effect, since the issu - ance of our order in Supplement 2 to Application .14559 effective Feb - ruary 4, 1941. The testimony of refinery operators and receivers of shipments of residual fuel oil, show that shipments of that commodity cannot move at rates higher than those applicable to gasoline or kero - sene. It also appears that the proportion of residual fuel oil pro - duced at Palis City and Salem; is so high that the rates applicable must permit the movemen.t of that commodity or our refineries cannol continue in operation. : .:-.'¦ ; : On the evidence, we arc of the opinion and find that the descrip - tion of petroleum products which was prescribed b.v us in Application 14559, as amended, in Supplement 2, February 4, 1941, to apply from Falls City and Salem should be: continual in effect and be applied to the transportation of all "-.shipments, of petroleum products from those refining points to all destinations in Nebraska to which rates on petro - leum products are prescribed herein. Nebraska producers of petroleum products have testified as to the difficulty which they have experienced in attempting to market their products in Nebraska because of the entire absence of reasonable com - modity rates and because of the severe competition of substitute fuels es- </seg>
         <seg id="p132">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT pecially cheap natural gas and steam coal. Before the discovery of paroleum deposits and the operation of refineries in this state the making of rates on petroleum products was governed by conditions affecting the transportation of those commodities from pipe line ter - minals and marine storage at Superior and Omaha. At this time tne changed conditions make the Nebraska rate making problem com - parable with that existing in other oil producing states such as Kansas and Oklahoma. The Nebraska refinery operators have testified that they need rates as low as those applicable within the state &lt;of Kansas lo permit the successful operation and reasonable growth of tlieir en - terprises. The record shows that the ton-mile earnings at rates ap - plicable to petroleum products between Kansas points are not unduly low but, on the other hand, compare favorably with the average earn - ings from all traffic transported by Nebraska railroads either in inter - state or intraslate commerce. On the evidence of record we are of the opinion and find that i casonable local and joint rates on petroleum products, as defined in our findings herein above, from Falls City and Salem to Nebraska destinations should be established on or before April 15th, 1941, as follows: (Table of Rates omitted) In the publication of the above prescribed local and joint rates, re - spondents shall make them applicable via the routes which have been, provided in existing tariffs for movement of similar traffic from the; affected origin points to destinations on the same line. No commodity rates are now in effect on petroleum products in carloads from Falls City and Salem to seventy of the ninety destina - tions involved herein. The prescription of necessary commodity rates of this character, where none exist, justify the requirement that the prescribed rates be published and made effective in less than the regular 30-day notice, to be effective April IS, 1941. We find that an emergency, as defined in Ch. 75-602, exists and justifies such publica - tion of rates on petroleum products in tank-car lots effective Apri! 15, '.041. In view of the history of this rate-making problem, the over-lap - ping issues in Resolution 153 and Application 14559 and supplements thereto and the common record of testimony adduced at the hearings respecting such issues, we are of the opinion and find that Applica - tion 14559 and supplements thereto should be merged with Resolution !53. ¦:¦¦'."

REFLECTORIZED SWITCH LIGHTS You inquire as to -whether or not the Nebraska State Railway Commission, in view of Section 74-570, Compiled Statutes of Nebras - ka for 1929, has authority to approve.as proper, refketorized switch lights for use by the railroads upon proof to that effect. , The section of the statutes above referred to requires railroad companies to "equip with proper lights all switch stands *• » . The Jights upon such switch stands shall be in good condition consUntly, and shall be lighted and kept burning between the time of sundown and sunrise and •?*.",.¦: ' Section 20, Article IV of the Constitution of Nebraska, contains the following provision relating to the Railway Commission: "The powers and duties of such commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of com - mon carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation, the commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in , this provision." In the case of State, ex reL Mitsouri Pwific Railway Company v. Henry T. Ctark, Jr., et «L, 98 Neb. 566, 153 N. W. 623, the Supreme Court of Nebraska held that under this constitutional provision, the State Railway Commission was authorized to fix rates only in the absence of specific legislation. . In discussing this problem in the case of Yellow Cab ft Bagng e Company v. Publix Can, et aL,'l26 Neb. 138, 253 N.

And such we deem to be the rule. The question then arises: Is there any specific legislation that limits or affects the power of the commission to act in the premises?" In view of the foregoing, it is our opinion that as the legislature has enacted a specific provision, setting out the kind of lights which must be used on switch stands, the Railway Commission does not have authority to approve the use of any lights which do not come within the legislative requirements. If a better light for this purpose is now available, the proper procedure would be to either have the legislature amend this act, so that the new equipment will come within its terms, or to repeal this provision altogether, in which event the Railway Commis - sion would have jurisdiction to consider evidence and approve any proper equipment. Respectfully submitted, WALTER R. JOHNSON, Attorney General (Signed) H. Emerson Kokjer H. Emerson Kokier Assistant Attorney General September 27, 1941 Nebiaska State Railway Commission State House Lincoln, Nebraska Gentlemen: RAILROAD ACCIDENT REPORT You have asked our opinion as to what requirements should be made and what procedure should be followed in carrying out the pro - visions of Legislative Bill No. 270, fifty-fifth session of the Nebraska state legislature. Section 1 of this law reads as follows: ' "Upon the occurrence of any serious accident upon any rail - road within the state of Nebraska, -which results in personal </seg>
         <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION \ injury or loss of life, the corporation operating the railroad upon which the accident occurred shall immediately furnish a copy of the same notice that they are required to furnish to the Interstate Commerce Commission to the Nebraska state railway commission, whose duty it shall be, if they deem neces - sary, promptly to investigate the same and promptly to de - termine the extent of the personal injuries or loss of life, and •whether the same was the result of mismanagement or neglect of the corporation on whose line the injury occurred; but such report shall not be evidence or referred to in any case in any court." '¦¦. The second and last section of the statute provides the penalty for a violation thereof. ¦ : A. reading of the first few lines of this act leaves one with the im - pression that reports of all serious accidents are to be made immedi - ately after their occurrence. Then in the same sentence one finds the provision that the railroad company shall make such reports by immediately furnishing "a copy of the, same notice that they are re - quired to file with the Interstate Commerce Commission." The rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission upon the sub - ject must then be examined to get the complete meaning of the Ne - braska Statute. These rules require immediate reports to the Bureau of -Safety of the Interstate Commerce Commission by telegram, of accidents which result in serious or fatal injuries to persons riding on the train, and reports'at the end of each month of all other serious accidents; ' '..... :'..;. •¦¦'••'. -¦'.¦./ ¦. ¦ ' •-' Obviously, until there is a report to the Interstate Commerce Com - mission there can be no copy of it. It is our opinion, therefore, that under this statute the Nebraska State Railway Commission should re - quire all. railroads to furnish to it copies of all telegraphic and monthly reports which are made to the Interstate Commerce Commission of accidents occurring upon their lines in Nebraska. If the commission deems it necessary, in order to better carry on any of the duties placed upon it by law, it is given specific authority under this statute to investigate any accidents reported. An exam - ination of the appropriation bill and the estimates of funds needsd for various functions of the state railway commission used as a basis for the appropriation for its activities, shows that no money was pro - vided for such investigation. In an emergency some other activity of the commission, for which funds are provided, might be curtailed enough so that the necessary engineering or other technical services could be obtained, but if future experience shows much need for such; </seg>
         <seg id="p138">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT investigation the facts should be presented to the legislature for their study and attention. Fortunately, the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion has assumed jurisdiction over safety of equipment and appliances, so the field most likely to require investigations of accidents has been taken out of the hands of the state commission.

Applicant has filed a map which shows the proposed routes of the railway and bus lines covered by the application and re-routing of some rail lines and the addition, extension, and re-routing of various bus lines. A street widening project has been set up for North 30th Street, between Fort Street and Bondesson Avenue, in the city of Omaha. The project will complete 30th Street as one of the principal north and south arteries in Omaha and has been certified by the War Department as useful for national defense. The removal of applicant's street car line on 30th Street is a requisite in the project as set tip. The cost of the project; will be in the neighborhood of $613,000 of which the city of Omaha's portion will be approximately $30,000, and the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company's portion $15,000. Applicant proposes to initiate bus service on 30th Street to take the place of street car ser - vice and will purchase 22 new buses for operation on this line. The new bus line on 30th Street, being a trunk line route, makes some changes necessary in several other routings to prevent duplication of service. ' - ..-. '. According to W.P.A. officials, the first part of the street widening project must be completed by June 30, 1941. The program calls fot the immediate commencement of this work.

The Nebraska Motor Carrier Act, which became effective August 16, 1937, and which placed under the jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Commission operations of "for-hire" carriers, continued in effect throughout the year 1941. Previous annual reports relate activi - ties of the Commission for the years 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1940. Several bills were introduced by the 1941 Legislature which, if passed, would have changed, in varying degrees, the jurisdiction of the Commission over motor carriers. These bills related primarily to the exemption section of the Motor Carrier Act None were passed. The number of motor vehicles registered with the Motor Transpor - tation Department increased during the year 1941, there having been tegistered with this office a total number of 4,707 units which engaged in the transportation of property and passengers on a "for-hire" basis. Of this number, 4;107 units, that is, straight trucks, tractors, trailers, and semi-trailers, each being considered as separate units, were registered and operated by property camera. Six hundred vehicles were registered fay passenger carriers. This number includes bus, taxicab and jitney operators.; . ¦'¦- ;' - V ;.,¦'¦ ¦- ; ¦ -V; ¦ .;•. .:.• ¦ '*-. . ¦ During the year 1941, 312 new, supplemental, or extension applica - tions were tiled with the department. With the exception of sand and gravel applications and some transfer applications, all were disposed of by the Commission following formal hearings, conducted by Examiners of the Motor Department. The numerous hearings held by the Motor Transportation Department have revealed that regulation of the bus and track operators presents many and diversified problems. The restric - tions and ambiguities of the Motor Carrier Act have necessitated in - vestigations and public hearings, in order to better stabilize the motor carrier industry. ' These hearings have aided the Commission in pro - viding adequate transportation service to all communities; The Inspectors of the Motor Transportation Department Wvc con- </seg>
         <seg id="p178">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT stituted an effective enforcement division of the Nebraska State Railway, Commission. Policing efforts and prosecutions for violations of the Motor Carrier Act in various parts of the state have resulted in respect for regu - lation by the various carriers and has eliminated, to a great extent, rate violations and other similar problems to correct which, the Motor Carrier Act was passed. The force of Inspectors was increased during the year 1941, and headquarters were established in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, and in McCook, Nebraska. It is hoped that further additions to the enforcement staff can be made in the immediate future. Passage of the National Selective Service Act, together with the declaration of war on December 8, 1941, created additional problems (or the department. Many of the holders of certificates of public con - venience and necessity were subject to induction into the armed forces of the U. S. Government. Where operators have been inducted, their certificates have been leased, transferred, and in some cases, suspended or "frozen" for the duration of the national emergency or until further order of the Commission. Induction created the further problem of retaining competent drivers and other employees, and, therefore, numer - ous truck and bus operators have curtailed service. This curtailment of service, however, has in no way jeopardized transportation facilities available to the public, and to the knowledge of this Commission, no town or community in the state is without adequate passenger and property transportation facilities. The regulation of the motor carrier industry during 1941 occupied an increasingly large amount of time of the Nebraska State Railway Commission. This is true largely by reason of the more vigorous opposition to new and extension applications. Protestants have filed exceptions to the recommendations of the Examiners, and arguments on such exceptions have been heard by the Commission. These argu - ments have proven beneficial to both the interested parties and the Commission and its staff in that the parties have been able to present to the Commission and its staff in that the parties have been able to pre - sent to the Commission a clear picture of the transportation problems in the various communities. It is thought by the Commission that the basic principals of regulation of motor carriers in Nebraska have been well established. During 1941, the Commission and its staff continued to cooperate with the Interstate Commerce Commission. It has been the policy to attend all joint board hearings in which the state of Nebraska and its citizens are interested or involved. Numerous conferences with the Interstate Commerce Commission Examiners and Supervisors have been held, and this cooperation has enabled the state to benefit by the ex- </seg>
         <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION perience of the Federal Commission and has aided in the solution of many state problems. . ; . ...'•.' CHANGES IN MOTOR CARRIER RATES handled by THE DOCKET METHOD On February 14, 1938, the Commission prescribed rates rules and regulations covering transportation of property by motor vehicle, which rates, rules and regulations were published in a tariff known as Official Truck Rates Classification, Rules and Regulations. In Application 13293 the railroads asked for and received authority to publish their W. T. L. 382 Series in order to meet motor carrier competition which tariff was almost an exart duplicate of the motor carrier tariff and became effective January 1, 1939. On November 24, 1939, the motor earners filed a petition, the prayer of which was the substitution ot National Motor Freight Classification together with exceptions thereto for the classification section of Official Truck Rates ¦.Classification," Rales and Regulations, and also sought to have rates based on actual highway distance traveled instead of airline mileage. This petition was treated by the Commission as an application and given No. 13927. After due hearing, the Commission entered its order in Application 13927, result - ing in the publication of Official Motor Vehicle Tariff No. 2, which tar - iff was vastly different from the original tariff known as Official Truck Kates Classification, Rules and Regulations, and as a result a disparity was created between W. T. L. 382-A'andl.Official Motor Vehicle Tariff No. 2. Numerous conferences were had between the motor carriers rail carriers and the Commission relative to this disparity and finally on September 22, 1941, the rail carriers agreed to publish another tariff so they would be on a parity with the motor carriers, provided the motor carriers would make a similar adjustment on interstate business from border line points, that is to say, Sioux City and Council Bluffs, lowa, St. Joe; Missouri, and Atchjson, Knnsas. From the above it can be seen that as long as property is trans - ported from one point to another, just so long will it be necessary to make changes in governing tariffs. Motor Transportation is no excep - tion, and in order that all certified carriers, as well as shippers, of the State might have the full benefit of changing business conditions and methods, a plan was agreed upon between the Commission and the Rate Department, on the one hand, and shippers and carriers, on tha other hand, that where any individual shipper or carrier, or group ot shippers or group of carriers desired a change in the rates, the proposal would be docketed by the Rate Department and all motor carriers and shippers of the State given the opportunity of expressing their preference either </seg>
         <seg id="p180">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT for or against the proposed change. In order that these dockets might be properly circulated and explained, the State was divided into twelve districts, each district having its own officers and being separate and distinct in and of itself, but, of course, reporting to the State office in Lincoln. Members of the Nebraska Motor Carriers Association through their district sccretery, or shippers individually are privileged to file a pro - posal with the Commission for a change in classification, rates or rules governing transportation of property. This proposed change is placed on a docket prepared by the Rate Department, circulated to all of the twelve districts of the State and the proposals voted upon by ballot, after which a determination of the votes is found and the shippers ad - vised accordingly. If there are no objections raised by the shippers within ten days from date of mailing the results of the docket, then the proposal, whether it be by a shipper or a carrier, is considered as non -controversial and is placed in the first Supplement issued to the tariff. If objections are received to any of the proposed changes in the tariff, the matter is then set down for formal hearing before the Commission for a determination. This plan has been in effect for some little time and has proven very satisfactory for the reason that the votes of the carriers at the called meeting and the action taken by the shippers after having been advised by the Rate Department does give the Commission the desired information looking to the amendment of the tariff. The procedure above outlined is similar to that applied to rail application and does enable the Commission to make the necessary changes in the tariff to keep up with the changing business methods without the formality of a hearing in many cases. (A) MOTOR TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES Under this general classification are included motor carriers operat - ing motor vehicles for passenger hire over fixed routes and between fixed termini in Nebraska Intrastate Commerce. The applications of these companies, where approved authorized the transportation of passengers, baggage and mail and express in con - formity with schedules of operations which must be filed with and ap - proved by the Commission. </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The Nebraska State Railway Commission on June 4, 1941, served upon William Kassebaum, dba Kassebaum Truck Line, Hebron, Ne - braska, an order to show cause why his certificate of public con - venience and necessity, Application No. M-139, should not be suspend - ed, cancelled, annulled or revoked in whole or in part for wilful failure to comply with the provisions of the Motor Carrier Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder. Hearing was had June 23, 1941, before an examiner, with the inter - ested parties being present and represented by counsel as hereinbefore set forth. Mr. Robert E. Powell did not participate in the hearing but took part only in the argument on exceptions to the examiner's report. The report and recommendation of the examiner was duly filed with the Commission on August 28, 1941* and thereafter on Sep - tember 6, 1941, exceptions to the examiner's report were filed.

         <seg id="p228">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT casionally to and from various points in the State of Nebraska on a state wide basis. The order to show cause charges respondent with violating the motor carrier act in that he has extended the scope of his operations and is now operating as a common carrier over regular routes between He - bron, Nebraska, and Lincoln, Nebraska, and is performing a regular service whereas his certificate authorizes only irregular route opera - tions. The evidence is undisputed that prior to the fall of 1540 the ' operations of respondent were of an irregular nature, both as to time and as to the highways over which he traveled. It is also undisputed that in September or October, 1940, the operations of respondent changed and he instituted a regular route service between Lincoln and Hebron, Nebraska. The service being regular both as to time, that is Mondays, 'Wednesdays and Fridays, and regular as to. .flic route traveled, that is, Highway No. 81 from Hebron to the junction with US Highway No. 6. thence via No. 6to Lincoln. It further appears that respondent held himself out to the public to provide this type of service uid posted cards and other advertising' material offering a regular route service between Lincoln and Hebron. The evidence, shows that operations were thus continued 'by respondent until November 1940, at which time a complaint was filed against respondent by the County Attorney of Thayer County, Nebraska, charging violation of the motor Carrier Act, as to regular route operation. Lite record shows that immediately following the filing of said com - plaint the above described operations were discontinued by respondent and that thereafter he held himself out to the public to perform only a "call and demand" service and such operations were continued to May 17, 1941. During this period of time the evidence shows that the major portion of respondent's operations were on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. No evidence was offered by respondent in the instant case to show that the public convenience and necessity required a regular route service between Lincoln and Hebron, nor did respondent offer evidence to show that during the period from Sep - tember 1940 to May 1941, traffic cither originated or terminated at points wihin a radial area of 25 miles of Hebron, but rather the evi - dence shows that the traffic nil originated or terminated at Hebron, Nebraska. Apparently respondent performed no service for shippers or consignees residing outside of the town of Hebron or within a 25 mile radius therefrom. From a careful consideration of the evidence adduced and argu - ment of counsel, the Commission being fully advised in the premises is of the opinion and finds: : </seg>
         <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ¦ 1.

         <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION on this application was held May 1, 1939, and the Examiner's report was filed with the Commission, August 7, 1939. Exceptions thereto were taken and oral argument to the Commission was had October 9, 1939, and on July 23, 1940, the exceptions were overruled and an order of the Commission entered approving the Examiner's report. A petition for re-hearing was filed and on December 4, 1940, an order was entered by the Commission setting aside the Examiner's report and ordering that the application be assigned for hearing de novo. In conformity with notice to all interested parties, the application was heard by an Examiner at Lincoln, Nebraska, on March 3, 1941. Applicant appeared .in person and was represented by his attorney. The protestants above named were not present in person but Were represented by counsel. • • . The long delay in the ultimate disposition of the instant transfer application was occasioned partially by reason of the filing and hearing thereon of applicant's interstate application before the Interstate Com - merce Commission, which filing was at approximately the same date as. that of the instant application and which necessitated two separate hearings, and partially by procedural difficulties before this Commis - sion and by motions, objections, and petitions for re-hearing. Upon consideration of the files and records of the Commission and from the evidence adduced at the hearing de novo, the Examiner prepared, a report which was filed with, the Commission, May 19, 1941, to which exceptions were taken by the protestants. Argument on the exceptions was had before the Commission, June 30, 1941. The service authorized and the territory to be served in Applica - tion No. 3754, which is sought to be transferred, is as follows: . "SERVICE AUTHORIZED: Commodities generally, except livestock, and except those requir - ing special equipment. . &gt; ROUTE OR TERRITORY AUTHORIZED: . Regular Route Operations: Regular Route N6.l—From McCook via US No. 6 to Imperial : (hence via Nebr. No. 61 to Grant, thence via Nebr.No. 17 to Elsie, thence via Ncbr.

Irregular Route Operations—To and from all points and places within a radius of 100 miles of McCook, Nebraska." The Nebraska State Railway Commission is authorized by statute to regulate all motor carriers for hire in intrastate commerce in Ne - braska: Section 75-201, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1'.»29. The evidence shows that the applicant has been engaged in mo - tor transportation service for the past ten years; that he has no Ne - braska intrastate authority. It further appears that he commenced operations in Nebraska intrastate commerce in the month of August, 1037, at which time he also commenced negotiations with- Floyd E. Grant, /or the purchase of his operating authority. The evidence shows that applicant has conducted said operations to the present time, notwithstanding the fact that no temporary authority has been issued to him. On or about the same date, applicant commenced daily operations between McCook, Nebraska, and Denver, Colorado, in interstate commerce. The evidence further shows that during said time, the actual opera - lions of applicant have been conducted only over regular route No. 2 of the Grant authority; that is, between McCook, Nebraska and Ben - kelman, Nebraska, and that said operation has continued from Ben - kelman, Nebraska to the Colorado-Nebraska state line, providing ser - vice to the Nebraska points of Parks and Haigler via U. S. High - way No. 34, notwithstanding the fact that said operations were and are wholly unauthorized by the Nebraska State Railway Commission. The service conducted over this route has been daily both ways and is conducted over the same identical route as applicant's interstate operations. It should be noted that the authority of Floyd E. •Grant under regular route No. 2 authorized servize from McCook to Ben - kelman westbound only, serving all intermediate points,, and between Culbertson and McCook, serving all intermediate points. The evidence further shows that operations and service have been abandoned over regular route No. 1, and that no operations have been conducted over the irregular route authority. -¦¦'". ¦¦; </seg>
         <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION That this Commission has the necessary jurisdiction to effect a transfer or to cancel, amend, or revoke operating rights involved in this application, is adequately set forth in the decision of the Nebraska Supreme Court in Effenberger v. Mirconnit, 135 Nebr. 558, wherein the Court held: ",&lt;¦'¦ "*f*We necessarily conclude that a certificate of convenience and necessity is in the nature of a permit or license and that it is not property in any legal or constitutional sense. It is a mere license that can be amended or revoked by the power authorized to issue it. Such being the case, it is personal in its character, is not transferable, and does not pass by succes - sion. It is purely a regulatory measure that can vest no property right uT the holder. This being true, the railway commission hat the sole power to grant, amend, deny, revoke or transfer a certificate of convenience and necessity. An attempt on the part of the district court to so do is without legal sanction." (Emphasis supplied) The question as to whether or not the service and operations ac - tually performed by applicant ; over the past several years tend to establish public convenience and.necessity along said route need not now be determined. The record is wholly lacking of any substantial evidence on this question and the only matter to be determined by this application is whether the transfer should be granted or denied. Upon consideration of the record, together with oral argument of counsel, the Commission is of the opinion and finds: 1. That the applicant, Leamon Resler, dba Resler Truck Line, is fit, willing and able to conduct the proposed operations, and to abide by and follow the rales and regulations of the Nebraska State Railway Commission under the Motor Carrier ;¦¦;• '"•Act.-::'¦¦;:¦¦¦¦ ;¦¦;¦-¦.'\ ..¦¦¦¦:.-¦.• 2.

' _ ¦¦ (2) That since the establishment of the prevailing rates there has been a substantial increase in the cost of operation of said business due to (a) increased cost of gasoline, (b) increased cost of oil, (c) in- </seg>
         <seg id="p236">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT creased cost of tires, and (d) increased cost of vehicles. &lt;3&gt; That in addition to the foregoing, and by reason of the pres - ent national defense program, there is added competition for the em - ployment of labor making it difficult for the applicant to secure drivers for its cabs at prevailing rates of pay, and unless the applicant is en - abled co increase the fares which it is permitted to charge the public for the use of taxi-cab service it will be increasingly difficult for the applicant to retain in its employment competent drivers. (4) That applicant has operated taxi-cabs in the City of Omaha for the past eight years; that it has diligently prosecuted said business and has, and does now, maintain the rates heretofore established by the Commission; that notwithstanding careful management and the practice of rigid economy in all phases of its operations, it believes that it will be impossible, to maintain its said business at those rates. (5) That there has and will be further increases in taxation and that the present rates are inadequate to meet said additional taxation. Applicant prays that this matter will be set for hearing, that notice of the filing of this application be given to all interested parties and that upon hearing applicant be permitted to offer testimony in support of this petition, and that, if the Commission so desires, the applicant's books may be audited and examined, and that similar action may be taken as to other taxicab companies operating in the City of Omaha in order that the Commission may verify the foregoing state - ments; and that after having considered the matter, the Commission make and enter an order "herein establishing rates for taxi-cab service in the City of Omaha commensurate with present day conditions, con - sidering the increased cost of operation hereinabove enumerated and for such other, further, and additional relief as to the Commission may seem just and equitable. On August 13, 1941, a copy of the above application was mailed to all parties at interest, by the Commission's secretary, for such com - ments as they might care to make. By letter of its Counsel, dated September 3, 1941, the United Cab Company, joined in the prayer of the Safeway Cabs, Inc., and indicated their wish to appear at a hearing to offer testimony in support thereof, and /urther offered to cooperate with the Commission by producing any records or other evidence the Commission might request. By its filing of September 17, 1941, the Checker Cab Company petitions the Commission to intervene and join in the application of the Safeway Cabs, Inc. </seg>
         <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION It thereby confirms and joins in all of the allegations of the peti - tion of the Safeway Cabs, Inc., and alleges that the present rates are wholly inadequate to operate said business at a profit and to pay reason - able wages to Its employees, because of all matters set out in the peti - tion of the Safeway Cabs, Inc., and other matters which will be sup - ported by evidence of this intervenor. .'¦:}..

Of these, 17 were owned by the company, and one was owned by the driver. Under an agreement the drivers of the company-owned vehicles are compensated, as follows; beginners—during first 60 days of em - ployment .1(5% of their gross bookings, thereafter for the next 60 days, JS% of the gross bookings, after the second 60 day period, 40% of the gross bookings, until after completion of one year service at which time, they receive 42% of the gross bookings. Any driver employed, who has had at least six months cab-driving experience within the last five years, receives as compensation 38% of his gross bookings for the first 60 days of his employment, and thereafter until he shall have completed one full year of service from date of his employment, re - ceives 40% of his gross bookings, and thereafter receives 42% of his gross bookings. The driver-owner pays to the company 25% of his gross bookings und pays all his own expense. He also gets 25% of the gross book - ings of the other drivers of his vehicle. The company gets the other 75%, out of which it pays the driver's commission, buys all the gaso - line on the non-owner driver's shift, and oil used on all the shifts. At the hearing, the company testified generally along the line oi the allegations set out in its petition. It offered no operating statis - tics. Upon request, statistics and other data were made available, which disclose the following: As of December 31, 1940, the company's total assets, less de - preciaiion reserve, amounted to $16,155.80. Total income for the year 1940 was $28,441.84, the expenses were $32,189.77, resulting in a loss from the year's operation of $3,747.93. As of August 31, 1941, the company had total assets, less de - preciation reserve, amounting to $16,177.31. The total income for the eight months ended August 31, 1941 was $24,760.93, expenses $25,208.81, resulting in a loss for that period of $447.88. A driver's individual record for 28 days of June, 1940, shows an average overall daily earning for the period of $2.97. The lowest in - dividual daily earning was $1.56, the highest $4.45. The owner-driver's </seg>
         <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION daily earnings were $4.55. A list of prices paid for gasoline shows an advance from 13.784 per gallon paid during the period of January 17, 1941 to March 29 1941 to 14.565* per gallon paid during the period of July 30, 1941 to Sep - tember 28, 1941. Testimony by the Checker Cab Company was to the general ef - fect that costs of operation have increased. Cost of cars has increas - ed* and thus depreciation expenses are increased. Gas has advanced from 12*3* per gallon paid on August 1, 1940 to 14.85* per gallon .paid on August 1, 1941. The company uses about 25,000 gallons of gas per month, which means an approximate monthly increase of $500.00 for 4his expense alone. The price of oil has also increased 13* a gallon. Drivers wages under the recent contract with the Union, are increased. This contract is identical to the one entered into by the Safeway Cabs Inc. and provides for the same basis of, compensation. This company' also has Lad a large turnover, in its drivers, and has difficulty in ac - quiring competent drivers. Many of the drivers leave for other em - ployment, where better wages are paid. At time:of hearing, the Checker Cab Company had 83 taxicabs- V of them in active service. In addition; 14 driver-owiied taxicabs were operated. \ ¦¦¦ On the driver-owned vehicles, the company Teceiyes a fee of 83(5 a day and. the use of the vehicle for the opposite" shift. In return the driver-owner receives all of the privileges of the company and minor repairs are made free of charge. ¦ There was no falling off inUhe volume of business after the last rate increase.. The present volume of business is greater than a rvear ago, but the increases in operating costs, have prevented.the com - pany from improving its financial status. . V. .. On December 31, 1940, the company's total assets, less deprecia - t'on^^/mOUnted to *45321:«. Total income for «he year 1940 w5?127,908.52, the. expenses were $128,149.65, resulting in a loss from the year's operations, of $241.13.

         <seg id="p240">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT on the investment. A drivers individual record for the month of June, 1941, shows an average overall daily earning of $2.86. The lowes* individual daily earning was $1.33, the highest $4.42. Testimony for the United Cab Company, was similar to that of the Safeway Cabs, Inc., and the Checker Cab Company. This company owns 7 taxi-cabs, of which 2 were idle at the time ol hearing, due to their inability to obtain drivers. It appears that former drivers of this company, have gone to the bomber plane factory, where they get higher wages. Under the present rates, on a 3St fare, the driver receives Wyit, under the rates as now proposed by this company, the fare on the same haul, would be 45*, and the driver receives W. No statistical data was offered in evidence during the hearing, but since then, upon request, this company has made available certain reports from which the following is derived. The total amount of income for the year 1940, was $18,069.10. The disbursements were $18,043.57. Included in the latter item, are car payments of $2,362.33. Deducting from the total disbursements, the car payments, leaves the total expenses at $15,681.24 or a return for the year of $2,387.86. However, there was not included in the ex - penses, anything for depreciation on depreciable property. Even if depreciation had been shown, it is doubtful if any operating profit would result. Reports were also submitted for the 8 months period ended August 31, 1941. The receipts for that period were $11,135.35, the disburse - ments $11,359.24. Like in the iormer reports, car payments amount - ing to $2,135.12 were included with the disbursements, and nothing added for depreciation, so again it is doubtful, that the company made an operating profit for this period. When the present rates for taxicab service were fixed, there was some apprehension as to the effect they would have on this particular company. At the hearing in the instant matter, it was testified that while during the first month or so, after those rates became effective, there was some hazard, as time went on they proved satisfactory, as such, but due to the recent enhanced costs of operation, they have become inadequate. No definite or specific showing could be made at the hearing as </seg>

From the showing that was made, however, it ap - pears that the rates proposed by the Checker Cab Company, are the most suitable under existing conditions. The representative of the Taxicab Driver's Union, who testified at the hearing, appeared favor - abld to those rates. . Specific request was made by the Commission, of the Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Company and the Ritz Cab Company for certain infonroi - tion, that might be of some valuci in reaching a decision in this case No response, was made by the Ritz Cab Company. The reports submitted by the Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Company show (her following: ; Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Company, during the year 1940, operated an average of 155 taxicabs. It's assets, at December 31, 1940, less depreciation reserve are reported, as $377,935.00. The total revenue for the year 1940 was $534,040.45, the total expense $525,11229, leaving a net income of $8,928.16. As of June 30, 1941, the company had total assets, less dfcpreciat lion reserve, amounting to $367,951.62. The total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 1941, was $283,127.55, expenses $280,00231, re - sulting in income, for the period of $3,125,24.

In support of this application it is alleged that Nebraska rates and freight classification prescribed m Resolution No. 146 for use by motor vehicle carriers different from those in effect for interstate transpor - tation to, from and through Nebraska; has created a chaotic and com - plicated condition in the application and interpretation of rates, ratings, and exceptions and rules and regulations among the motor vehicle com - mon carriers operating within this state and that numerous prefer - ences and prejudices or discriminations have been created as between shippers in Nebraska and in the relation between Nebraska shippers and those located at points in other states. It is further averred that the present ratings and rates react to the disadvantage of shippers and receivers of freight in Nebraska and that the continuance' of the exist - ing classification and air-line rates, as well as the present scale of rates on fresh fruits, vegetables, groceries, potatoes and sugar "creates an undue burden on motor carriers operating in this state". Appli - cants further allege that the prescription of the National Motor Freight Classification and exceptions thereto set forth in Exhibit A, are neces - sary to permit petitioners to compete with Nebraska railroads on even terms. . ¦'¦ ' ¦¦ •'.', : .-': -: - ¦ -; ' ¦ ¦ ¦ . The National Motor Freight Classification is a copyrighted book of 441 pages published by Agent C F. Jackson, for the American Trucking Associations, Inc., Traffic Bureau of Washington, D. C, which has been filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and many state railroad commissions on behalf of motor carrier lines whose names are shown as parties thereto, as a basis for ratings on commodi - ties moving on interstate and intrastate commerce. Generally speak - ing, said classification is substantially the same as the railroad freight classification known as the Consolidated Freight Classification. Ap - plicants propose that we approve and make effective voluminous ex - ceptions to the National Motor Freight Classification by means of which ratings on various commodities lower than those provided in the National Motor Freight Classification will be made effective* To </seg>
         <seg id="p248">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT : illustrate what is proposed, a reference to the National Freight Classi - fication will show that Drugs or Mcdiciners 1.. T.L. arc rated first class or column 100, but if we now refer to the Exceptions to the Classifi - cation we shall find that drugs, medicines and toilet preparations are subject to a rating 30 per cent lower than that shown in the National Motor Freight classification, which may be referred to as the inter - mediate", third class or column 70-rating. If this proposal were approved each Nebraska motor vehicle com - mon carrier would need at least one copy of the National Motor Freight Classification. Motor vehicle common carriers now parties to the National Motor Freight Classification have paid a fee to the 1 tariff publishing agent and a charge of $2.50 additional for each copy of the tariff and supplements which the motor vehicle common carrier may require. Shippers may secure a copy of the classification and. all the supplements, as issued, for $2.50. Motor vehicle common carriers not parties to the classification can also purchase copies of the classifica - tion ami supplements, as issued for $2.50. This record shows that if the National Motor Freight Classification is approved for Nebraska intrastate application copies will be furnished for Nebraska intra - state motor vehicle common carriers at a cost of $2.50 for each tariff issue and supplements thereto. The proposed exceptions to 'fits. classification would make a substantial separate tariff which either the motor vehicle common carrier or the Commission would have to pub - lish and place in tlve hands of each motor vehicle common carrier be - fore he could properly determine the classification rating on any ship - ment. The proposed use of highway mileage instead of airline mileage as a rate base would require the re-publication of practically all motor vehicle rates between points in Nebraska and generally on a higher level than that now in effect. "Intervening petitions" in support of this application were filed by a considerable number of motor vehicle common carriers, some of whom arc members of petitioners organizations. Petitions in opposition to applicants' proposals were submitted by a considerable number of motor vehicle common carriers. opposing the proposed classification and exceptions as being too intricate for the average motor vehicle common carrier to understand and because of the expense entailed by the use of such tariffs. Opposition is also expressed as to any system of rate making which will increase the motor vehicle rates now applicable and, by so doing; stimulate, the in - creased use of private motor vehicles by shippers to avoid payment of such increased freight rates and charges. ; . </seg>
         <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Our files also contain letters from county motor carrier organiza - ions, individual motor common carriers and shippers expressing their informal opposition to these proposals for various reasons.„ The opening hearing was held_ at Lincoln, .March 5,-1940, and sub - sequent hearings were held at Grand Island, North Platte, Alliance, Norfolk, Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, the final hearing being held at Lincoln, May 22, 1940. ; Applicants' witnesses support their petition by showing that the National Motor Freight Classification is a very complete list of articles ot commerce produced, shipped or consumed in Nebraska and through - out the nation by reference to which the rating therein fixed can be definitely determined with a minimum of ambiguity and conflict in lat ings. The proposed classification is used by most interstate mo - tor vehicle lines and is applicable as a basis for classification govern - ing motor vehicle operations in many states in all parts of the United States. The; Nebraska operators have experienced some difficulty in determining the- applicable ratings under our classification and conflicts in ratings or interpretations of the tariff by motor vehicle common carriers and shippers have been annoying. By reason of the fact that "articles not specifically listed" in the Nebraska Classification are sub - ject to the intermediate (column 70) rating and the further faot that the railroad classification and exceptions thereto have, in some jn - stancos, provided, a fourth class specific rating applicable to the same article, the rail rate or rating has been somewhat lower, in such in - stances than the intermediate rating applicable via motor vehicle routes. It is claimed that traffic has been diverted from motor vehicle lines to the railroads in such instances but the record does not disclose the volume* of traffic affected and the revenue losses of any motor vehicle common carrier resulting from such diversion of traffic. Nebraska shippers and traffic managers of our Chambers of Com - merce agree that a simplified classification is desirable; that the pro - posed National Motor Freight Classification and Exceptions tariffs would be expensive, too complicated and unduly burdensome. They expressed their conviction that the existing classification could be clarified and amplified to form a more acceptable basis of freight class - ification than that proposed by applicants herein. Shippers objected specifically to the numerous increases in rates and ratings which would result. For example it; appears that applicants propose to increase the first class rate from Grand Island to Alliance 6f per cwt, but that an increase of 2# per cwt would result from applying the increased second class rata of $1.04 under the. National Motor Freight Classifica - tion in lieu of the present intermediate rate of 81* per cwt. The tes - timony offered in support of the: proposed use of the National Motor* Freight Classification and proposed exceptions was introduced by of- </seg>
         <seg id="p250">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT fictrs of motor vehicle lines who are already parties to the proposed classification and who therefore t would not incur any additional ex - pense by reason of its use' in Nebraska. There is no" testimony offer - ed by any owner or operator of an intrastate motor vehicle common! carrier who is not now a party to the National Motor Freight Classifi - cation and interstate exceptions tariffs, stating any specific objections to the Nebraska Classification or showing that such an operator^ fa - miliar with the actual proposals knows of any specific advantage which would accrue to him which would_in any degree compensate for the out-of-pocket expense involved. No such small intrastate motor vehicle common carrier was produced to state that he could determine the applicable ratings by use of the proposed National Motor Freight Classification and exceptions tariffs or to say that the increased ratings or rates proposed were' either necessary or desired. Applicants propose that the present scale of class rates shall be icprescribed but that such rates shall be applied to the distances "based upon the mileages as indicated on the preient 'Official Map of the Nebraska State Highway System,' which map was prepared and pub - lished by the Nebraska Department of Roads and Irrigation as revised to the year 1938." In the existing tariff prescribed by our order in Resolution No. 146 the rates are determined by use of air-line mile - ages. Of course, the actual highway mileages are never less than the air line mileages but are generally greater. The general effect of this proposal would therefore be to increase the existing rates. The official map of the Nebraska State Highway System does not show any county or township roads regardless of the road surface involved. A gravelled or paved county or township road which is passable' and used by motcr vehicle conion carriers at all times of the year is not shown on this map although it may be shorfer than the State Highway System road which applicants propose to use in determining revised class rates in lieu of those now in effect. Applicants approve the present practice of publishing specific tariff rates in cents per cwt. from all important manufacturing and jobbing points to destinations in Nebraska. Neith - er the motor vehicle common carrier nor the shipper is required to actually compute the air line mileage to determine the rate applicable between points in this state. In fixing the first class rate of 8W per cwt. from Omaha to Grand Island an "air-line" distance block of 190 miles was used. The map which applicants propose to use as a basis for ratfc making shows a short line highway distance of 137 miles from Omaha to Grand Island via alternate route U. S. 30 via Wahoo, Ne - braska, which would make the first class rate 86tf per cwt. instead of Ihe present rate of 84&lt;* per cwt. based on the "air-line" mileage. The mileage from Omaha to Grand Island via Fremont is 148 miles for which a first class rate of B&lt;W per cwt, would be applicable. For a route of 152 miles from Omaha to Grand Island via Lincoln the scale first class rate would be 004 per cwt. The distance from Omaha to Grand </seg>
         <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Island via Hastings and Lincoln is 185 miles for which the scale rate first class would be 984 per cwt It Is obvious that the shipper of freight at Omaha and the receiver at Grand Island are not benefittud if the shipment is hauled by a motor vehicle common carrier operating via Fremont or Lincoln and Hastings over much longer routes than the short highway route between the points via Wahoo. Under ap - plicant's proposal a .rate of 864 would be made effective from Omaha to Grand Island via all routes although operators via Hastings such a» Coffey Transfer, Woods Truck Line, Fischer Transfer Company, and others would be forced to haul the shipment ,185 miles from Omaha to Grand Island which is 48 miles further than the route of the direct haul via Wahoo between the same points. The route via Hastings is 35 per cent (48V miles longer than the direct (137 mile) route from Omaha to Grand Island. The scale of rates which applicants propose was prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Ne - braska State Railway Commission as a basis for rates made on short line mileages, which generally are not used in the actual movement of freight and the level of the prescribed rates was fixed on a higher basis thati would have been justified if the movement of freight was confined to the actual short lines. In other words when the air-line 130 mile, distance was used the Commission determined a just and reasonable first class rate of 84 cents from Omaha to Grand Island which it knew would be applied both by the short haul motor vehicle common carrier for a distance of 137 miles and for longer routes such as those via Fremont, Lincoln, and Hastings to Grand Island. If the Commission prescribed the lowest rate which could be justified con - sidering the cost of service on a route of 130 or 137. miles from Omaha to Grand Island then motor vehicle common carriers via Lincoln and Hastings for a distance of 185 miles might be compelled to accept less than the cost of the service, including a reasonable profit, when charg - ing the same rate or they would forego their right to haul such traffic by charging substantially higher rates via Hastings to Grand Island. The present "air-line" tariff basis is a method of fixing rates based on the absolute short line between point of origin and destina - tion, applying a rate scale adjusted to compensate for actual move - ment over routes involving greater mileage. As shown by analysis of the'rate making problem as affecting rates from Omaha to Grand Island applicants agree that the rates should be based on a short line and the, problem of compensating motor vehicle common carriers trans - porting shipments via longer actual routes is identical with the prob - lem presented in fixing the present rates on the "air-line" mileage. Applicants showing is that higher freight rates would be fixed if we used the short distance via official state highway route mileages as Of 1938 instead of the air-line mileage. The protesting shippers and the Chambers of Commerce properly designate the proposals </seg>
         <seg id="p252">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT herein as general increases in the applicable rates. Such proposed increases are based primarily on applicants' contentions as to the short line mileage which should be used in fixing just and reasonable rates. There is no evidence here that the individual members of the applicant, Nebraska Commercial Truckers Association, Inc., is receiving earn - ings from his intrastate operations, at rates fixed by us, which are less lhan the cost of the service or less than the operating expenses, taxes and a fair return on the investment, after apportioning all such costs and expenses between the intrastate and interstate operations. On this record there is therefore, no justification for any such general increase in the Official Common Carrier Truck Rates prescribed in Resolution -Vo. 146. *, . Applicants have repeatedly claimed that their proposals herein are designed to bring about competitive equality between the rates of Ne - braska motor vehicle lines and Nebraska railroads. Mr. E. T. Parks, a witness for all railroads in Nebraska, submitted testimony categori - cally denying the contention that the proposed changes are necessary to place motor vehicle common carriers operating in Nebraska on a, parity with Nebraska railroads transporting the same commodities be - tween the same points. There was no cross-examination of Witness Parks and no attempt was made to rebut the statements and exhibits which he offered. On this record, we arc therefore forced to conclude that applicants' major proposals for adoption of the National Motor Freight Classifi - cation and exceptions thereto and for a revision of the rate structure by computing rates on the basis of mileages shown on the 1938 Of - ficial Map of the Nebraska State Highway system have not been justi - fied. There is no evidence justifying the increased rates, ratings, and charges which would result from these proposals. Having reached this conclusion have we done our full duty in this proceeding? The orders in Resolution No. 146 which we arc asked to modify by this application are the result of an investigation by the Commission en its own motion responsive to a requirement of the 1937 Legislature in 1.. B. 178 that just and reasonable rates for application liv motor vehicle common carriers between points in Nebraska shall be determined, prescribed and enforced by us within the limited time fixed by statute. The evidence received in this proceeding is germane lo the issues considered in Resolution No. 146. Applicants seek both the specific relief discussed above and also the issuance of such "other order or orders or other relief as to the Commission may seem reason - i'lble and just".

Such a revised classification has been pre - pared and is attached hereto marked Exhibit I and is made a part here - of by reference thereto. This revised classification gives to applicants the benefit of adjustments which are justified while retaining a simpli - fied form o( classification which seems to best suit the needs of Ne - braska motor vehicle common carriers generally and our shippers. In approving and prescribing this revised classification we are-mindful of the fact that many important changes in Classification are being ac - tively considered by both the railroads and motor vehicle common car - riers in all parts of the United States. In addition to these changes now being 1 considered by the carriers there is a national investigation of classification ratings applicable by rail and by motor vehicle common carriers in all parts of the United States, pending unheard by the Inter - state Commerce Commission. All of these things forecast further changes in classification ratings which will eventually be reflected in our classification, . , Applicants propose a special adjustment of rates applicable to Gro - ceries, Fresh Fruits and Vegetables in 2,000 lb. lots. This commodity basis is proposed as desirable in the interests of motor vehicle common carriers and shippers who face increased competition by shippers who operate their own trucks. Shippers agree that this is a step in the right direction but object to the proposed 2,000 lb minimum on the ground that this provision would favor chain stores and discriminate against the competing small ¦ merchant whose shipments are said to average about 300 lbs. We are'convinced that a lower basis of rates applicable to L.T.L. shipments of Groceries, Fresh Fruits and Vege - tables, as listed in the revised classification hereto attached and marked Exhibit I, should be prescribed for experimental use until the further order of the Commission. The prescribed special commodity rates on Groceries, Fresh Fruits and Vegetables are set forth in Appendix II which is attached hereto and is hereby referred to and made a part hereof.

Weller Assistant - Director , Motor Vthicle Division ¦ Department of Roads and Irrigation Building: Dear Sir: We have yours of May 2, in which you say: "The Miro-Flex Company, of Wichita, Kansas, has made in - quiry to this office relative to the approval of their Miro-Flare, in the state of Nebraska. Descriptive circulars describing the flare, and its use, are attached for your information. "Section 39-11112, C. S. Supp. 1939, requires the placing of a 'lighted flare' at the side of the vehicle, etc. May we have your opinion as to whether the principle of light reflection as applied in the Miro-Flare would conform to the require - ment of the above named section of the statute?" We have examined the request for approval of the Miro-Flex Company of their product and have examined the statutes of this state with reference to their product conforming to the terms of the statute.. We find that Section 39-11, 112, C. S. Supp. 1939, provides for the placing of a lighted flare and throughout the provisions of this statute kis so specified. It is also specified that the flares must be - plainly visible for a distance of 500 feet. The product of the Miro-Flex Company is only visible in the event that it is reflecting a light which strikes it, so that in no sense could it be said to be visible at a distance of 500 feet when the additional requirement of a light to be reflected is necessary to make it visible. We are of the opinion that the product of the Miro-Flex Company does not come within the terms of the statute. Respectfully submitted, WALTER R. JOHNSON Attorney General C. S.

It is our opinion that the carrying out of such an arrange - ment would be illegal. Respectfully submitted, Walter R. Johnson Attorney General (Signed) H. Emerson Kokjer H. Emerson Kokjer Assistant Attorney General September 24, 1941 Nebraska State Railway Commission State House Lincoln, Nebraska Gentlemen: Section 75-708 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929 In your letter of September 8 you set forth Section 75-708 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, which reads: "Nothing herein shall prevent the carriage, storage, </seg>
         <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION or handling of freight free, or at reduced rates, for the state, or for any city, county or town government, or for charitable purposes, or to and from fairs and expositions for exhibition thereat or the transporting free of household goods of express employees or railroad employees, moved in the service of their respective companies; or the transporting free of personal property of those who are employed exclusively by express companies or railroad companies operated .by steam; nor to prevent any common carrier from carrying property free, with the object of providng relief in cases of general epidemic, pes - tilence or other calamitous visitation." You submit two questions relating to the application of the fore - going section. The first: - "Will you kindly advise if it is proper for carriers in this state to submit bids quoting rates other than those pre - scribed by Official Motor Vehicle Tariff No. 2, for the trans - portation of the property of the U. S. Government in intrastate commerce." ; . : ¦;... - And secondly you ask: . "Will you also advise if it would, be necessary for a carrier transporting property for the U. S. Government in intrastate commerce to have requisite authority issued in a certificate of public convenience and necessity! from this Commission, before he can legally transport such property." ¦¦ It seems to us that the basic and fundamental question to de - termine is the comprehensiveness of the term "state" as used in the section. That is, does"state" refer to The State of Nebraska, or is it used in a broader sense so as to include the federal government? Under the Federal Motor Carrier Act "state" is defined to mean "any of the several states and the District of Columbia." ; Under the Interstate Commerce Act. reference is made to free and reduced rate shipments of property "for the United States, state or municipal governments." tT. 49, Sec. 22, USCA). The latter act was passed many years before the Nebraska sta - tute in question, so I assume that the Nebraska legislature had it in mind when it framed our law. "State" is generally used to indicate an individual state of the union in contradistinction to the United States as a nation. Used in the international sense, the United States is, of course, "a state". See </seg>
         <seg id="p262">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT McLaughlin vs. Pouchcr, 17 A. &lt;2d) 767, 770. It seems quite obvious that "state" as used in Section 75-708 was intended to mean The State of Nebraska in its political or govern - mental capacity. This being true, the federal government and its agencies are necssarily excluded. The federal statutes regulating commerce have no application to transportation which is strictly intrastate, even though carried by carriers otherwise engaged in interstate commerce. The statute in question is, in its nature, permisive only. ' This means that under some circumstances, the state and the carriers may contract i'or a rate for a particular shipment, independently of establish - ed tariffs. However, ordinarily the state is only entitled to have its property transported at the lowest rate available to the general public Such is the rule with reference to the transportation of federal govern - ment property, with the exception that from such rate is subtracted land grant deductions. The foregoing does not bear directly on the questions put to us in your letter. It is mentioned to indicate that the governm.nt is not favored over its citizens except under unusual circumstances. Specifically answering your first question, it is our opinion that it is unlawful for carriers to quote rates other than those pre - scribed by Official Motor Vehicle Tariff No, 2, for the transportation of United States government property in intrastate commerce. :, Specifically answering your second question, it is our opinion that carriers transporting property for the federal government in intra - state commerce must comply with all provisions of the Nebraska Motor Carriers Act, the same as though they were transporting property for Ihe general public.

Denied, January 7, 1941. See page 261) INFORMAL COMPLAINTS Pending at close of year.-: .......... ; ....0 Disposed of during the year .... I : '¦¦ BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the Matter of the Application of The) Dawson County Irrigation Company for) APPLICATION an Order Authorizing an Increase in) NO, 13882 Kates. &gt; OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: )¦'- The Dawson County Irrigation Company, applicant herein, is a cor - poration organized under the laws of Nebraska, owning, operating, and maintaining a system of irrigation works. It takes water by means of its main canal on the north bank of the Platte River, near Cozadand serves patrons in Cozad, Coyote, Lexington, Grant, and Overton pre - cincts in Dawson County, Nebraska. It handles not only natural flow water but also storage water received under contract from the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District. Rates for the use oi such water have been prescribed by this Commission and arc as follows: $1.50 per acre, annual maintenance charge on perpetual water rights entitled to natural flow water only; $1 JO per acre, annual maintenance charge on perpetual •..-.¦_' ,'. ,: water rights entitled to both natural flow water V : and storage water purchased by' the Company . from the Platte Valley Public Power and Irriga - .-: ' .'¦¦¦¦ ¦: . ; tion District: :; .; ' ~ .'¦ ;r -¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p264">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT $3.00 per acre, for summer water furnished to lands not under perpetual water rights; $2.00 per acre, for spring and fall water furnished to lands not under perpetual water rights. The applicant seeks to increase each of the above rates by the sum oi 50 cents. . The Dawson County Water Users' Association, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nebraska, whose stockholders are alt'water users and patrons of The Dawson County Irrigation Company, filed an answer or protest to the application of the Company, opposing the in - crease sought by the applicant, and making a counter-proposal that the annual maintenance charge on perpetual water rights entitled to natural flo%v water only, be reduced to $1.00 per acre, and that the rate for sum - mer water furnished to lands not under perpetual water rights be re - duced to $2.00 per acre. Both the applicant and the protestant offered evidence in support oi' tlieir respective claims, and the matter was heard on January 8 to 12, inclusive, 1940, before Commissioners Good and Swanson, at Lex - ington, Nebraska. It appears that the rights affected here are substantial. " The ¦ length oi the main canal of the Company is 42 miles, varying from 80 feet in width at the headgate to approximately 8 feef at the wasteway. There are 35 laterals served from the main ditch, the total length of which is approximately 136 miles. There are 140,000 acres under the system, approximately 111,000 acres of which are under the appropria - tion. The present Company is successor to the Farmers and Merch - ants Irrigation Company, title having been acquired by the present company in 1913. The original system was constructed between 1890 and 18y4 and the priority date oS the iirst appropriation is June 25, 1894. Applicant has issued, and now has, outstanding perpetual water rights entitling the users to natural flow water only, in the amount of 7,276.5 acres and 5,517.15 acres in perpetual water rights entitled to both natural flow and storage water. Applicant is at the present time under contract with the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District to receive storage water, and is entitled to a maximum of 50,000 acre feet of storage water each year from the Sutherland Reser - voir. Broadly speaking, the applicant founded its claim for increase upon its revenue needs, whereas the protestants contended that the rates which the Company is now receiving are now higher than those in use by any of the other irrigation systems in Dawson County, of which </seg>
         <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION there are four, three of the same being, however, organized as public or non-profit districts and not being subject to the regulation of the Commission, It was also contended on the part of the protestants that tht present rates are now so high that it has caused patrons who would have otherwise used water from the applicant's system to construct and install irrigation wells and pumps and thereby definitely lessen the revenues received by the applicant. Protestants insist that the lower rates proposed by them for the particular kind of service to which they are applicable, would result in an increased use of the facilities of the applicant's system, and a consequent increase in its.revenues. To jus - tify-the setting aside of the present rate schedule and a revision either upward or downward, the applicant or the contestant, as the case may be, should carry the burden of convincing the Commission that the present rate schedule is either too high or tod low. Discussing first the evidence presented by the applicant, applicant relied chiafly upon an appraisal of its property, used and useful in the service, on the oasis of cost of reproduction new less depreciation. This appraisal (Exhibit 11) has been considered by the Commission not only in the light of the evidence afforded by it and its explanation as disclosed by the record, but also in light of special study made of it by the Commission's engineer, and a report made to the Commission. It is quite apparent that the unit costs on which the appraisal is based were submitted by the applicant's engineer from his general knowledge and information, and no attempt was made to support the same by corroborative testimony. Likewise, the testimony as to depreciation is entirely unsatisfactory. No actual inspection or observation of the actual depreciated condition of the property was made nor was any adequate testimony introduced as to service life. Testimony concern - ing ownership of right-of-way is contradictory, applicant claiming that title is vested in it and protestants claiming that many of the deeds contain a reversionary clause. . The Nebraska Supreme Court in McCook Irrigation and Water Power Company vs. Burtleu, 98 Nebr. vi, said: .;=:¦;..¦¦•..¦¦ "The Railway Commission is not vested with juris - '•¦'¦¦;¦¦'¦ diction to settle disputed property rights as to owner - ship of an irrigation canal." However, it will be readily noted that a right-of-way is an essen - tial element in an irrigation system and that some expense is necessar - ily incurred in procuring it. It is also apparent that once having ob - tained a right-of-way as a part of an irrigation system It has a value to both the water users and the Company and should be included in the property valuation. . : . Witness Nosky did not attempt to appraise each piece of land in- </seg>
         <seg id="p266">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT eluded in the right-of-way, but applied a value of $100. per acre to all such land indiscriminately as right-of-way value ana not necessariry real estate value. No other figures were submitted and protestants disputed said value. Testimony concerning excavation is very confusing, resulting, for the most part, in differences of opinion as to the present condition of the canal and whether such item should be depreciated and, if so, how much. The following table reflects the conclusion of applicant's engineer as to the appraised value of the property on the basis of reconstruction new, less depreciation. It is inserted here not for the purpose of ap - proval in all or any part, but with the express comment that the Com - mission finds that it affords little or no aid to the Commission in its present problem. 988.4 Acres of real estate @ $100. $98,840.00 Deduction as per Nosky's statement, 68.6 Acres @ $100. 6,860.00 $91,980.00 840,700 Cu.

         <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION tified that the present Company purchased the properly at sheriffs sale in 1913 for $20,000; that from an investigation made by him at that time and from his personal knowledge of the Company! the plant •was worth approximately $184,000. Many extensions, changes and betterments, however, have been made since the present owner took it over. : The record shows that $200,000 of common stock and $75,000 of bonds were authorized, of which $140,000 of stock was actually issued and is now outstanding:. Of the $140,000, $80,000 represents stock actually sold for cash and the balance of $60,000 in stock was issued as stock dividends. Bonds in the amount of $75,000 were issued, $62,500 of which are still outstanding. The interest rate on the bonds is 5 per cent "with penalty rated 8% after bonds were due." The bonds became due on January 1, 1938, but the Company has not been paying the 8 per cent penalty rate. Interest on the bonds was paid to July, 1939, although the bonds were past due and it appears that they are worth approximately one hundred cents on the dollar at the present time. Dividends of 6 per cent were paid on the stock to 1929. The last stock transfer was made four or five years ago a«. fifty cents on the.dollar, therefore, assuming at the present time it is -worth the same amount, the outstanding stock would amount to $70,000. That amount added to the outstanding bonds in the amount of $62,500 results in a total figure of $132,500. Throughout the record there are several figures quoted which are alleged to represent the price asked by applicant in a contemplated sale of the property and also figures representing offers made by prospect* We purchasers. At one point Mr. Stuckey testified: "I told you some place or another that they (applicant) might take $145,000 for their equity, as it was, " *•*?•? purchaser to "assume all indebtedness and expense o{ transfer." . '¦¦''¦': . At;another point he testified that applicant would sell for one-half of the value of the property as found by an accredited engineer.. It was also testified that the Protestants offered to purchase the property for the amount represented by the outstanding bonds, plus the purchase price which would amount to $82,500. Protestant witnesses also tes - tified that at a meeting held for the purpose of affecting a sale, appli - cant offered to sell for $150,000. This was disputed *y applicant. The applicant offered in evidence Exhibit 2, which is a comparative statement of income and expense for the years 1928 to 1938 inclusive. Exhibit 7 is a statement of income and expense for the year ended De - cember 31, 1939. </seg>

This probably was occasioned by adverse eco - nomic conditions, disputed billings, and ill will. The Company's books for the years 1935 and 1938 show large amounts charged to "Discount Allowed.". These discounts very likely arose from the same factors as brought about bad debts. The amounts so charged are large enough to affect materially the net return on investment. It is apparent from the foregoing tabulations of income and ex - pense that the ten year average amount available for interest deprecia - tion, and dividends was $9,402.50. The Company has paid bond inter - est of 5 per cent to January .1, 1940, and 6 per cent dividends on stock to 1929. . •:'... V :¦¦;'¦• :.•;¦ ;¦. ¦¦¦ '¦: ..{ .¦'¦¦;, '¦; Evidence shows that there are a large number of private irrigation wells in the territory served by the Company and that possibly an in - crease in the Company's rates would result in the installation of more wells. The effect of private irrigation wells on the Company's income is speculative. While the Commission is thus of the opinion that the evidence adduced by the applicant is entirely insufficient to support its claims generally for increased revenue and for additional return upon its in - vestment there is one phase of its application which deserves more de - tailed treatment and which appears to the Commission to be meritorious. The Company has a contract with the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District for 50,000 acre-feet of storage water annually at $1.00 per A-ft. The Company charges the storage water users $1.00 ¦per.A-ft. which allows the Company nothing for the use of its facilities in transporting the water and. its services in distributing the same. The Company under the present storage water rate must absorb the ditch loss due to evaporation, seepage, etc The Company claims these loss - es amount to approximately one- third and ask a rate increase of 50 per cent to compensate for the loss. The other irrigation com - panies whose¦¦ representatives testified in this matter have the same rate for storage water as The Dawson County Irrigation Company, to - wit: $1.00 per- A-ft These other companies, however, with the ex - ception of the Gothenburg Light and Power Company are cooperatives and not .in the irrigation business.as a financial enterprise but to ren - der a non-profit service to their members. The. Gothenburg Light &amp; Power Company charges $1.00 per A-ft, but the charge is for.water -delivered at the headfate which means that the irrigator must stand the ditch loss. •- Cooperative irrigation companies merely render fa non - profit service to their members and their rates, therefore,' are not' com - :¦•:-¦ ; \ '¦¦"'¦ ¦'.'¦¦ ¦¦¦• '¦ '¦¦¦'.-¦ :v. ¦¦¦¦•¦.¦. :¦¦¦¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p270">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT parable to common carriers. Mr. B. G. Edwards, manager of the Gothenburg Light and Power Company testified in reference to storage v/ater that, "It was necessary to compute the approximate ditch Joss and check on it to verify . . . estimates ... we arrived at a figure of 43 per cent loss from our diversion to the water users land." The Gothenburg Light &amp; Power Company's supply canal from the point of diversion to the City of Gothenburg is 10 miles long. This canal . is not used for irrigation but the water in it would be subject to evapo - ration, etc. Any estimate of the probable earning capacity of the irrigation sys - tem under particular rates is bound to be highly speculative because of the unpredictable factors such as rainfall which affect the ultimate re - sult. An estimate of potential revenue based on present rates and tlie. testimony of Mr. Paul Stucky, General Manager of the Company would approximate $78.000., which, if received under present conditions, would probably net the Company more than what is generally deemed to be a fair return on investment With regard to the evidence adduced on the part of protestants, which amounts to a little more than an expression of belief on the part of the witnesses as to what conditions would result if the particular rates in which they are interested should be lowered, it seems to the Commission that this evidence is entirely speculative, and that it would not be justified in acting upon the same. The Commission having given consideration to all the evidence in this matter and being fully advised in the premises, finds: 1. That the application should be denied except as to the rate for storage water. 2.

Good . \ GOOD, DISSENTING IN PAiRT: Although I concur in majority finding and order as it relates to application in the matter of denial of a rate increase, as set forth in order, however 1 cannot agree with my colleagues that the testimony indicates that an advance in storage rates is warranted. Notwithstanding that, the Dawson County Company pays the a- </seg>
         <seg id="p272">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT mount of $1.00 per acre foot for storage water and sells same to con- Mimer at $I.oo'per acre foot, which apparently makes no allowance or returns for seepage, evaporation, maintenance or retnrn on the invest - ment, yet upon analysis we find that although the company receives for its $1.00 an amount of water, which if directly applied would put twelve inches of water on an acre of ground, we find (see testimony) that no consumer wants or receives 12 inches at z watering and that a watering, by virtue of established custom is erroneously designated as an acre foot. Testimony adduced would indicate that about five inches of water was even more than an average watering. Assuming five inches to be an average application then five-twelfths of the one acre foot bought l.v the company would actually be released upon the consumers land. This would allow seven-twelfths of an acre foot to be absorbed for seepage, evaporation and maintenance and still leave a fairly substan - tial margin for interest or profit, or both, on the investment. It appears in the testimony that due in a large way to an inade - quate supply ol ditch water, that more than 200 pumpings wells lor irrigation purposes have been developed in the immediate territory of ilie Dawson County irrigating system. This is the alternative way of providing irrigation water where there is inability to obtain same from the ditch company, or where water rates are considered excessive by the consumer. In the field of economics there is an unwritten law' recognized, known as the law of diminishing returns, and its relation to the instant matter is that with higher water rates that the customer may or will provide himself, still further, with his own water supply system, and the advance in price of storage water of 35 percent may encourage sucli a trend. For reasons herein set forth, I hold that the said increase in stor - age rates over rates established elsewhere in the same localized territory is not warranted and may possibly result in a decrease of revenue to the company. Therefore I hereby dissent from that part of the issued order. . F. A. Good, Commissioner. </seg>

The Nebraska Continental Telephone Company, applicant herein, B a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Nebraska with headquarters in the city of Columbus, Nebraska. It is engaged in the operation of a telephone business with its principle telephone properties and business located within the State of Nebraska. Among other telephone exchanges and properties it owns and oper - ates the exchange in Tilden, Nebraska and furnishes the citizens of Tilden and vicinity with telephone service from said exchange. Applicant alleges that the revenue which it now receives and has been receiving for many years past from the operation ot fhe Tilden Exchange is not sufficient to pay actual tost of operation and taxes upon its property devoted to such purposes, and by reason thereof it has received no return upon its investment in said telephone properly. The present schedule of gross and net monthly rates being charged Tilden subscribers for telephone exchange service is as follows: BUSINESS ):.:/v -y'r " NET Common Battery One party monophone, wall or desk $4.00 $Jjs Extension monophone, wall or desk ._ 100 Local Battery &gt; ¦ One party, wall or desk (metallic) 2.25 £00 One party monophone (metallic) 2.50 2^25 Extension, wall or desk (metallic) ........ !» .

         <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Applicant further proposes that there be placed in effect by order of this Commission upon the completion of the metallizing of the rural lines of the Tilden Exchange, the following schedule of gross and net monthly rates to be charged rural subscribers for telephone service from the said Tilden Exchange. . RURAL—-Local Battery GROSS NET Residence ten party, wall (metallic) $2.25 $2.00 Pursuant to notice a public hearing was held in this matter in the District Court Room at Madison, Nebraska, on January 17, 1941, before Commissioners Swanson and Larson, at which time interested parties were given opportunity to be heard and adduce such testimony and evidence as they deemed pertinent to the case. According to the applicant the present basic rates at Tilden were eflective as of May 1, 1920, with service from 6:00 a. m. to 10:00 p.nu After 10:00 p. m. to 6:00 a. m. there is a charge for calls of ten cents each,. Applicant proposes to rebuild and metallize its rural lines, estab - lish full 24-hour service, and eliminate the 10 cent charge for night calls. On behalf, of the subscribers it was -contended that the valuation submitted in evidence by the applicant was too high, and that many of the subscribers will not remain if the rates applied for, are granted. The difference betw/een the value reported for taxation purposes, and the appraised value, was adverted to. The gist of the testimony of protestants, was that there exists con - siderable noise and cross talk, particularly on the rural lines; that if the rates arc raised without improvement, there is bound to be a loss in the number of subscribers, and that the value of the service to the sub - scribers, depends upon the number of subscribers with whom he can be connected. . . .

Wopat, introduced by and on behalf of the. applicant, shows the reproduction cost new of the physical property of the Tilden exchange, on May 1, 1940, as $44,492.00. Deducting $502.00 as the proportionate amount of vehicles and other work equipment, which also serves the Neligh ex - change, and deducting depreciation leaves $34,689.00. Included in the appraisal at a depreciated value of $300 is an old vacant building. Ac - cording to testimony, this building is not necessary for rate making purposes, or the operation of the property. Likewise, it appears that a garage, included in the appraisal at a depreciated value of $325 is not necessary tor the operation of the property. Deducting these 2 items in their entirety leaves $34,064. By adding $655.00 to this amount for ma - terials and supplies, the total reproduction cost new of the physical </seg>
         <seg id="p286">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT property, less depreciation is $34,719. It appears that there was some damage to the rural pole lines, as a result o{ the storm of November 11,1940, as compared to the condition found in that property on May 1, 1940, the date of the appraisal. The records tend to show that whatever damage there may have been, has been offset by additions made since then. According to our information, due to the National Defense Program, the cost of material and labor has advanced. The Commission believes it reasonable to assume, that any differences of opinion, as to the appraisal value, would be offset by the increased costs since the date of inventory. It appears that the rural lines would require rebuilding even though there was no metallization involved, and in view of the fact that the rebuilding is contemplated, and that the R. E. A. interference will soon be an actuality, applicant lias decided to metallize those- lines': The estimated net additional increase, as a result of metallizing and re-build - ing, in the total plant is $5,420. The city plant is completely rebuilt now, and the metallic service in the rural area will serve, the community: much better, and should eliminate the noise and cross talk that now exists. The difference between the value reported for taxation purposes, and the appraisal value referred to by protestants, may, or may not, affect the accuracy of valuation figures for rate making purposes. - However, tax assessments arc not controlling and are usually of little aid;: J n 20 N. S. U. C. 359-360 (367), in considering a similar situation, we said: "Protestants called the Commission's attention to the fact that the property of applicant in Sidney was turned in to county officials for taxation purposes, at a ¦¦¦•'. much lessor figure than they claimed for rate, making purposes. The Commission is aware of the fact that such discrepancies exist in public utility properties, sim - iliary as they do in properties not devoted to the public - use. Neither commissions nor courts have attached im- ' portance to this figure in reaching conclusions as to fair value." In the case of Knott v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Ri Company, 230 U. S. 474, the Court said, among other things: ¦ "Valuations placed upon railway properties by the state assessors for purposes of taxation do not afford an ade - quate basis for a determination as to the fair value of the property when testing the reasonableness of state regulation of railway rates, especially where the prind- </seg>
         <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION pies governing the assessments are not properly shown." • Another of applicant's exhibits shows the book value of the Tilderi exchange on July 1, 1940 as $46,119.00. Adding $1,155.00 to this figure for'materials and necessary working capital, $502.06 for vehicles and work equipment, and $5,419.62, the estimated cost of metallizing and te» building the rural lines gives a total of $53,195.68. Deducting from, this amount the depreciation reserve, we arrive at a net book investment of $44,417,15. ;¦¦'•: The past net earnings of the Tilden exchange, are as follows: for the year 1933, $1,278.00; for 1934, $1798.8g; for 1935, $1,979,28; for 1936, $2,392.14; for 1937, $1,334.35; for 1938. $483.89. In 1939 there was an oper - ating deficit of $233.06. These earnings were after allowing for all actual operating expenses, taxes, and depreciation computed in accord - ance with this Commission's General Order No. 59, and without includ - ing anything for return on investment in the property, that is necessary and useful in rendering service. ; The applicant lias received a meager return from its entire company operations. The per cent of income to assets for the entire company was 3.66 for 1935, 4.00 for 1936, 2.68 for 1937, 2.54 for 1938, and 2.58 for 1939. ¦ ...; ....":... '¦¦;. :¦¦¦¦¦¦.. .¦¦..: .¦• ; ; A comparative statement of rates (net) per month for. telephone service in towns from 1,050 to 1,150 offered in evidence shows that at the Tilden Exchange, the business and switching rates are less than any in the group, and the residence and rural rates are below the average. An exhibit offered in evidence by the applicant prepared on basis of rates How in effect/and on the then existing conditions, shows the following results for the year ending June 30, 1940, collectible operating revenue $6,708.42; total operating expenses and taxes $7,189.95; balance for return, a deficit of $481.53. Giving effect to the rates applied for and the expenses incurred in this proceeding (to be amortized over a 3 year period), the results for that same period are as follows: collecti - ble operating revenue $10,670.34; total operating expenses and taxes $8,155.95; balance for return $2,514.39. A return of $2,514.39 amounts to 6.19 per cent on the fair value of the property as determined by Engineer Wopat, $34,719 plus cash work - ing capital $500.00, and net cost of metallizing rural lines $5,420, or 6.66 per cent on the net book investment of $44,417.15. : ; Considered strictly on the basis of probable earnings under the pro - posed rates, there could I&gt;e some question as to their reasonableness. From a comparative standpoint, however, the proposed rates are high. </seg>
         <seg id="p288">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT It is the Commission's opinion, that in the fixation of reasonable rates, there must be considered, among other things, the effect such rates will have on the public being served, and whether or not the probable results under rates so fixed will benefit the serving company. When a rate is so high, as will result in many subscribers discontinuing the service, it is ob - vious that the service becomes of less value to the remaining subscribers, and the company docs not beneiit thereby. On the other hand, the ad - ditional revenue resulting from an adjustment of existing exchange rates will enable applicant to rebuild its lines and metallize grounded circuits and thus result in better service efficiency and more subscriber interest! and benefits. It appears that the cost of rendering service to switched subscribers is in excess of the rate proposed therefore. In respect to the miscellan - eous charges, included herein, which is permitted to take effect, will in some instances constitute a change from the present charges, it ap - pears that the charges applied for are reasonable, excepting the charge (or change of instrument, which it is believed should be continued at $1.00.

It is engaged in the operation of a telephone business with its principle telephone properties and business located within the State of Nebraska. Among other telephone exchanges and properties, it owns and operates the exchange in Battle Creek, Nebraska, and furnishes the citizens of Battle Creek and vicinity with telephone service from said exchange. , Applicant alleges that the, revenue which it now receives and has been receiving for many years past from the operation of the Battle Creek Exchange is insufficient to pay actual costs of operation and taxes upon its property devoted to such purposes, and by reason there - of it has received no return upon its investment in said telephone property. The applicant further alleges that within approximately a pwiod of eighteen months preceding the date of application, it has rebuilt the said Battle Creek Exchange for the purpose of improving the service.

It was testified by numerous rural subscribers and sub - stantiated by photographs, that the rural lines were in very poor con - dition; that some of the lines were, down and in some instances the poles had rotted off and were leaning badly, and that there, was considerable noise and crosstalk on some rural lines apparently caused by REA electric power and transmission lines. The protestants contended that the rates proposed by the applicant were too high and that the increases applied for exceed the, value to the customers of the present service rendered. The record and evidence show an inclination on the part of some subscribers to pay a .higher rate for better or improved service, but not to.the extent proposed by the applicant company. On behalf of the patrons there was also introduced in evidence the company's tangible personal property return for tax assessment pur - poses.. ¦ ...' ¦¦'¦¦¦¦'.¦:'•,:¦;¦¦ ','.-'¦'---V:.,,- ¦ ..¦.¦¦•••¦¦¦.¦.-¦..-¦"-¦¦' </seg>
         <seg id="p294">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT The applicant did not deny that its rural lines are in poor physicat condition and its intentions are to metallize, all of the rural lines and rebuild where, necessary. It is shown that the need for metallizing is. based on exposure to power lines. Where there are power lines par - alleling grounded telephone circuits it is imperative that the service be metallic. Metallization of the lines will increase the per cent condition of the plant and improve materially the service to all subscribers and overcome the poor service condition of the rural lines. As to the valuation shown on the tangible personal property re - turn for tax assessment purposes, such showing may, or may not, in some measure reflect the accurary of valuation figures for rate making purposes. However, tax assessments are not controlling and usually are of litlle aid. In 20 N. S. R. C. 359-369 &lt;367), in considering a simi - lar situation, we said: "Protestants called the Commission's attention to the fact that the property of applicant in Sidney was turned in to county officials for taxation purposes, at a much lesser figure than they claimed for rate making purposes. The Commission is aware of the fact that such dis - crepancies exist in public utility properties, similarly as they do in properties not devoted to the public use. Neither commissions nor courts have attached impor - tance to this figure in reaching conclusions as to fair value." In the case of Knott V. Chicago, J3. &amp; Q. R. R. Company, 230 U.S. 474, the Court said, among other things: "Valuations placed upon railway properties by the state assessors for purposes of taxation do not afford an ade - quate basis for a determination as to the fair value of the property when testing the reasonableness of state regulation of railway rates, especially where the prin - ciples governing the assessments are not properly shown." At the present time the, hours of service at the Battle Creek Ex - change are on week days from 6 A. M. to 10 P. M. On Sundays and holidays they are, from 8:30 A. M. to 2 P, M. and from 3 P. M. to 9 V. M. Under the rates applied for, it is proposed to provide full 24: - -hour daily service. This additional service will cost applicant approx - imately $600.00 annually. There was introduced in evidence by and on behalf of the applicant,' a unit inventory and appraisal of the entire plant by J. W. Wopat, dated </seg>
         <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION May 1, 1940, which shows the reproduction cost new, of the Battle Creek Exchange, as $50,370; less depreciation, $36,517. These amounts give effect to the vehicles and other work equipment,'in the total a - mount of $1,017.76, which are used for both the Madison and the Battle Creek exchanges and in the appraisal are allocated on basis of 50 per cent to each of the said exchanges. After adding the estimated cost of net additions, in the amount of $3,327.00 on account of metalliz - ing the rural lines, the total amount of reproduction cost new less de - preciation becomes $39,844. This is without the material and supplies in the amount of $610.00 and for necessary cash working capital in the sum of $500.00. The records show that the unit costs applied to the inventory were made as of May 1, 1940. The computations were made on wholesale cost of reproduction. At the time of hearing, it was indicated that there had been an increase in material costs since May 1, 1940. According to our information, due to the National Defense Program, the cost of ma - terial and labor further advanced since that time. It is reasonable to as - sume that any differences of opinion, which might exist in respect to the inventory and appraisal value, submitted by the applicant company, wouM be more than offset by the increase in the cost of materials and labor that have taken place since the date of inventory. Another of applicant's exhibits shows the book value of Battle Creek Exchange, on July 31, 1940, as $50,182.82. Added to this for materials and necessary working capital the sum of $1,110.00, and a proportion of vehicles and work equipment, $484.44, and the estimated cost of metal - lizing' the rural lines, $3,32726, results in a total of $55,104.5?. Deduct - ing from that amount the depreciation reserve of $9,393.22, a net book investment of $45,711.30 is obtained. . : ¦"¦'.¦; The net earnings of the Battle Creek Exchange have been of small amount for some years .past. Specifically, they are as follows:- for 1933, $601.97; for 1934, $6933; for 1935, $1,035.76; for 1936, $1,307.48; for 1937, $722.15; and for 1939, $184.83. In 1938 there was an operating deficit of $210.26. These earnings resulted after allowing for all actual operating expenses, taxes and depreciation computed in accordance with this Commission's General Order No, 59, and without including any - thing for return on investment in the property, that" is necessary and useful in rendering service. • ' The applicant has received a meager return from its entire company operations. The percent of income to assets for the entire company was 3.66 for 1935, 4.00 for 1936, 2.68 for 1937, 2.54 for 1938 and &amp;58 for 1939. :. A comparative statement for rates (net) per month for telephone service in towns with population from 700 to 800 offered in. evidence, </seg>
         <seg id="p296">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT shows that at the Battle Creek Exchange, the business rates are less than any in the group; the resident rates are below the average, and the rural rales are as low or lower than any in the group. An exhibit offered in evidence by the applicant, prepared on basis of rates now in effect, and on the then existing operating conditions, shows the following results for the year ended July 31, 1940; collectible operat - ing revenue $5,866.26; total operating expenses and taxes $6,563.01; bal - ance for return, a deficit of $696.75. Giving effect to the rates applied for and the expenses incurred in this proceeding (to be amortized over a 3 year period) and adding the expenses that will be incurred in the establishment o( full 24-hour service, the results for that sam« period are indicated as follows: collectible operating revenues $10,445.27; total operating expenses and taxes $8,151.07; balance for return $2,394.20. A return of $2,29420 amounts to 5.60% on the fair value of the property as determined by Engineer Wopat, $39,844 plus $1,110 for materials and cash working capital, or 5.02% on the net book investment of $45,711.30. Considered strictly on the basis of probable earnings under the proposed rates, it does not appear that said rates arc unreasonable. Front a comparative standpoint, however, the proposed rattes appear some - what high. li is the opinion of the Commission, that in the fixation of reason - able rates, there must be considered, among other things, the. effect mch rates will have on the public being served, and whether or not the probable results under rates so fixed will benefit the serving company. The protestants have alleged that the rates proposed exceed the value to the customers of the service rendered. No showing was made as to how such value could be determined. However, when a rate is so high that it will result' in many subscribers discontinuing the service, it is obvious that the service becomes of less value to the remaining subscribers. On the other hand the additional revenue resulting from an adjust - ment of wcisting exchange rates will enable applicant to rebuild, its lines and metallize grounded circuits and thus result in better service effi - ciency and more subscriber interest and benefit. The Commission is of the opinion that the interest of all parties con - cerned will be better served if the following gross and net monthly rates are established, in lieu of the rates proposed and applied for by the applicant-. </seg>

Larson BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATS RAILWAY COMMISSION In the matter of the Application of the) I Nebraska Continental Telephone Company ) APPLICATION I for approval of rates at the Orleans, Ne-) NO. 14477. &lt; braska, Exchange, (as amended). ) i OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: The Nebraska Continental Telephone Company, applicant herein, is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of tne State of Nebraska with headquarters in the city of Columbus, Nebraska. It is engaged in the operation of a telephone business with its principal tele - phone properties and business located within the State of Nebraska. Among other telephone exchanges and properties, it owns and operates the exchange in Orleans, Nebraska, and furnishes the citizens of Or - leans and those in the vicinity thereof with telephone service from taid exchange. V Applicant alleges that the revenues which it now receives and has been receiving for many years past from the; operation of the Orleans exchange is not sufficient to pay actual costs of operation and taxes upon its property devoted to such purposes and by reason thereof it has re - ceived no return upon its investment in said telephone property. According to the applicant the present schedule of gross and net monthly rates being charged Orleans subscribers for telephone service is as follows: . ¦ ¦ . :.,-¦.¦'.'¦ .'¦•'•¦¦ •'¦:' </seg>

On behalf of the subscribers it was contended that the valuation submitted by the applicant was too high, and that many of -the sub - scribers will not remain if the rates applied for, are granted; that owing to the'drouth and economic conditions, now is a poor time to increase rates; that with improved crop conditions, they would be in better po - sition to stand an increase in ratet and patronage would also increase. The difference between the value.reported for taxation purposes, and </seg>
         <seg id="p304">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT (he appraisal and book value, was adverted to. The girt of the witnesses' testifying for the protestants was that if rates arc increased as proposed, many telephones will be taken out; that there is not so much population in the territory, as there was in the past; that the general conditions have been tough; that not so many subscribers can now be reached, as in the past, because of subscribers having discontinued service due. to hard times; that with improved crop conditions they would be willing to pay some increase in rates; and that it the applied for rates are granted, the applicant company will defeat its own purposes. An inventory and appraisal by J. W. Wopat, introduced by and on behalf of the applicant, shows the reproduction cost new of the physical [iropcrty of the Orleans exchange on July 1, 1940, as $49,228. Deduct - ing a proportionate amount of the vehicles and other work equipment, that arc also used at other exchanges, results in a figure of $48,730, less depreciation $38,.i17. Adding to this amount $514, for material and supplies, and $500 for cash working capital, establishes the total repro - duction cost new, less depreciation as $39,531. According to our information, due to the National Defense Program, the cost of material and labor has advanced, and the Commission be - lieves it reasonable to assume, that any difference of opinion, as to ihe appraisal value, would be offset by reason of the increases that have occurred since the date oS inventory. . . As to the difference between the value reported for taxation pur - poses and appraisal value, it may be said that such showing may, or may not, in some measure, reflect the accuracy of valuation figures for rate making purposes. However, tax assessments are not controlling and are of little aid. In 20 N. S. R. C. 359-360 (367), in considering a similar situation, we said: "Protestants called the Commission's attention to the fact that the property of applicant in Sidney was turned in to county officials for taxation purposes, at a much ' lesser figure than they claimed for tate making pur - poses. The Commission is aware of the fact that such discrepancies exist in public utility properties, similarly as they do in properties not devoted to public use. Neither commissions nor courts have, attached impor - tance to this figure in reaching conclusions as to fair . value." In the case of Knott v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company, 230 U. S. 474, the Court said, among other things: </seg>
         <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "Valuations placed upon railway properties by the state - assessors for purposes of taxation do not afford an ade- : quate basis for a determination as to the par value of the property when testing the reasonableness of state regulation or railway rates, especially where the prin - ciples governing the assessments are not properly shown.'' . .;"¦ Another of applicant's exhibits shows the book value of the Orleans exchange on July 31, 1940, as $51,969.56. Adding to this for materials and necessary cash Working capital $1,014.00, and deducting for a pro - portion of the vehicles and work equipment $518.36 results in a figure of $52,465*20. Deducting from that amount the depreciation reserve, we arrive at a net book investment of $42,219.69. The past net earnings of the Orleans exchange! were as follows: for the year 1934, $129.23; for 1935. $78.93; for 1936; $496109. In other years the deficit* suffered, wtere for 1933, $47.80; 1937, $157.05; for 1938, $123.72; and for 1939, $697.05. These earnings and deficits were after allowing for all! actual operating expenses, taxes, and depreciation computed in accordance with this Commission's Gen - eral Order No. 59, and are without including anything for return on the investment in the property, that is necessary and useful in. ren - dering service. ''•''.; ¦ .;." ;.. : The applicant has received only a meager return from its entire com - pany operations. The per cent of income to assets for the entire company was 3.66 for 1935, 400 for 1936, 2.68 for 1937, 2.54 for 1938 and 2.58 for 1939..- . ' ¦ :'\~ :•. . ::¦:,¦¦ - .-:¦'; T". A comparative statement of rates (net) per month for telephone . service in towns from 935 to 1035 shows that at the Orleans exchange,* the business rate with two exceptions is less than any in the group, the residence rate with one exception, is less than any in the group, and the rural and switching rates are below the average for the group. . An exhibit adduced in evidence by the applicant that was prepared on basis of rates now in effect, and on the then existing conditions and with depreciation computed on basis of the Engineer's findings, shows the following results for the year ending July 31, 1940, collectible op - erating revenue $5,106.66, total operating expenses and taxes $6,391.16, balance for return, a deficit of $1,284.50. Giving effect to the rates ap - plied for and the expenses incurred in this proceeding (to be amortized over a 3 year period), the results for that period are, as follows: collect - ible operating revenue $8,790.21, total operating expenses and taxes $7,190.10, balance for return $1j600.11. </seg>
         <seg id="p306">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT A return of $1,600.11 amounts to 4.0S per cent on the fair value of property as determined by Engineer Wopat, $39,531, or 3.79 per cut on the net book investment of $42,219.69, This leads to the conclusion that, from a standpoint of returns on the investment, the applicant may reasonably be entitled to the rates applied for, even though said rates in comparison are higher than rates generally assessed for service in other towns of similar size to Orleans. It in the Commission's opinion, however, that in the fixing of reason - able rates, there must be considered, among other things.the effect such rates will have on the public being served, and whether or not the probable results under the rates so fixed will benefit the serving com* pany. When a rate is so high, as will result in many subscribers dis - continuing the service, it is obvious that the service becomes of less value to the remaining subscribers, and the company does not benefit thereby. Since the time of the hearing, crop prospects and general conditions have taken a turn for the better. It appears that the cost of rendering service to switched subscribers is in excess of the rates proposed therefore. The miscellaneous charges applied for are based upon the actual experience of the company and considered in that light are not unreasonable. The Commission is of the opinion and finds that the interest of all parties concerned will be better served if the rates and charges pro - posed, are granted as applied for, modified to the extent indicated by the following: Rates per month Business Gros» Net One party wall, desk or mono (metallic) $3.75 $3.50 Extension wall, desk or mono 1.00 Residence One party wall, desk or mono (metallic) 2.75 2.50 .

Of the total 926 subscriber stations served at the Ord exchange on July 31, 1941, all were receiving magneto service with the exception of 36 bus - iness subscriber stations and 15 residence subscriber stations, who were receiving common battery service. Applicant alleges that the majority of business and residence sub - scribers of the Ord exchange have requested it to provide full common </seg>
         <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION battery service for all .business and residence subscribers, and in con - nection therewith to erect a suitable and new telephone exchange, build - ing, and to provide such subscribers with new telephone instruments of the monophone type. After extended consideration and study of such requests and the requirements for the rendition of adequate telephone service, the management of the applicant company has concluded that it is necessary and in the interest of rendering a suitable telephone ser - vice to meet such request and requirements and to provide fuH common battery service for city exchange subscribers of the Ord exchange, both business and residence, and in connection therewith to erect a new fire - proof exchange building and to provide and furnish such city subscrib - ers with a choice of new instrument:, either monophone desk or mono - phone wall sets. \ " • Included with the application is an exhibit being an exact and true copy of a form of approval to the proposed improvements in telephone plant and service and to the revised rates for such service, as herein applied for, : The said form of approval has been signed and delivered to the applicant by 79% ofthe business subscribers and 54% of the residence subscribers. An additional 8% of the business subscribers and 9% of the residence subscribers did not sign the written forms of approval but did orally: advise the applicant that they were in favor of the im - provement and the increase in rates. In addition thereto the Chamber of Commerce of Ord has by resolution, that has been duly filed with the Commission, authorized E. C. Leggett, Chairman of the ChaimVr of Commerce Telephone Committee, to evidence the approval by the said Chamber of the applicant's proposed improvements in plant and service and the basic rates for such service as herein applied for. ¦ At an informal conference held in respect to this application, on the afternoon of. September 10, 194 V, it was submitted to the Commission, on behalf of the Ord subscribers, by attorney Davis and C. J. Mortensen, President of the Ord Chamber of Commerce, that by reason of the peti - tions and the apparent lack of opposition to the proposals and the pres - ent difficulty of obtaining necessary material, it was deemed desirable, that action be taken by the Commission without a hearing. They also informed the Commmission that present conditions at Ord are somewhat better than they have been for some time. Also that some of the area is'being irrigated and thus good crops are assured. Irrigating in this territory commenced about three years ago and many more acres will be placed under irrigation in the future. It was further brought to the attention of the Commission that Ord is the only town of its size, in the State, that has the type of telephone service that it now receives. From the Commission's records, it appears that the present rates at Ord, for main station magneto service have been in effect since April 1, 1920 and that the main station rates for optional common battery ser- </seg>
         <seg id="p314">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT vice have been in effect since December, 1936, A comparative statement of rates, net per month for telephone ser - vice in towns from 2,000 to 3,000 population, shows that at the Ord exchange the present rates for magneto service are, with one exception, lower than any in the group. An inventory and appraisal by J. W. Wopat, a consulting engineer, that was included with the application, shows the reproduction cost new of the physical property of the Ord exchange on June 1, IiMO as $60,(176. Deducting a proportionate amount of the vehicles and other work equipment, which ate also used at the Burwell Exchange, results in a figure of $59,291, less depreciation $46,533. Giving effect to the, ad - ditions and retirements that have been made to the plant, since the in - ventory was taken, reduces this amount to $46,196.30. On basis of the estimated net cost of converting to common battery service, the total reproduction cost new, of the plant, less depreciation will comet to $50,290.16. Adtlin« to each of these amounts -$888.00 'for material and supplies, and $1,085.00 and $1,105.00 respectively, for cash working: capital, makes the total investment before conversion $48,169.80, after conversion $61,283.16. This is without (,'iving any consideration: to in - creases in unit costs of materials and labor since the date of appraisal, on June I, 1940. It is a matter of common knowledge, that due to the National De - fense Program the cost of material and labor has advanced, and the Commission believes it reasonable to assume, that any differences in opinion as to the appraisal value, that might exist, would be more thaa off-set by reason of the increases that liave occured since the date of inventory. The book value of the Ord exchange as of July 31, 1941, is shown as $59,292.95. Deducting a proportionate amount of the vehicles and work equipment, which are also used at the Burwell exchange, results - in a figure of $58,685.33, less depreciation $48,387.98. Adding the net estimated cost of converting the plant to common battery service $8,427.07' will make the total book cost $56,815.05. Including $888 for materiat and supplies, and $1,105.00 for cash working capital, makes the totat book investment of the Ord exchange, after conversion to common battery service, $58,808.05. Scrutiny of available records covering the Ord exchange, leads to the belief that the returns from the past operations of that exchange have been inadequate, as they have fallen short of -providing a reason-1 able return on the investment. The per cent of income to assets for the entire company was 3.66 for 1935, 4.00 for 1936, 2.68 for 1937, 2.54 for 1938, 2.58 for 1939 and 2.35 for 1940. </seg>
         <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION A statement presented by the applicant, that was prepared on basis of rates now in effect, and on the then existing conditions, and with de - preciation computed on basis of the Engineer's findings, shows the fol - lowing results for the year ended July 31, 1940; total collectible operat - ing revenues $15,531.01, total operating expenses and taxes $14,021.39. balance for return $1,509.62. This amounts to 3.13% on the total invest - ment of $48,196.80 as determined on basis of the Engineer's appraisal. Giving effect to the rates herein applied (or, and the provision (or depreciation computed in accordance with this Commission's General Order No. 59, and other adjustments due to the conversion of plant to common battery service, and the federal income taxes adjusted in ..ac - cordance therewith, the results for the year ended July .31, 1941. are as follows; total collectible, operating revenues $18,621.47, total expenses and taxes $14,399.05, balance for return $4,222.42. The reasonableness of any return is extremely difficult of determin - ation. It is apparent that because of the uncertain conditions as now prevail, any conclusions reached, as to either returns or operating con - ditions,-can have no assured stability for any reasonable time. The Commission, however, having continuous jurisdiction, can make such adjustments as may be necessary in the future . The community .of Ord has prevailed upon the company to furnish an improved service, and the company has consented to do so, albeit at considerable cost to itself, and many of the subscribers have signed for such service at the rates herein applied for. '¦'¦¦ . Nevertheless, all parties at interest, should be given an opportunity to be, heard, and the Commission is therefore.of the opinion and finds, that any and all parties at interest, should be directed to appear at a hearing set for the 9th day of October, 1941, at 2:00 o'clock P. M. in the Commission's Hearing Room at Lincoln, Nebraska; and show cause, if any. there be, why this application for rates for the contemplated im - proved service should not be granted. . . . ¦ The Commission is of the further opinion and finds, that should insufficient cause be shown, said instant application should be granted, the same to take full force and effect, on the first ensuing Ord billing date, after the Ord exchange has been converted to common battery service and that type of service is actually being rendered, provided that said conversion shall take place within the period of one year from the date of this order, unless extended by further order of this Commission. . : </seg>

Applicant proposes to construct single phase and three phase lines to be operated at a potential of 7200 volts to ground or neutral Wire and 12,450 yoUs between phase wires. Consents by, or agreements with all the owners of existing com - munication and electric transmission lines liable to be affected by the. proposed construction were not filed with the Commission at the time of filing of the application, and in accordance with the law and the Commission's General Order No. 72 all such parties named by appli - cant were notified to appear at a public hearing in the matter, ¦;'•• Pursuant to said notice the application came on for hearing on March 21, 1941, which afforded any and all interested parties an op - portunity to offer evidence in support of, or in opposition to the grant - ing of the application.

         <seg id="p354">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT The Village of Pottex objects to the construction of applicant's proposed line upon the south side of the Northeast Quarter of Sect 34, T.ISN., R.S4W, since such construction would conflict with a line proposed to be built by the Village of Potter on the same route and construction of which had been begun by the Village of Porter. Tht Village of Potter was authorized by the Commission by order entered February 28, 1941, in the matter of Applcation No. 14643 to construct a three phase 6600 volt line on that route. Mr. Ray Gunderson, tenant in possession of the Northeast Quarter ot Sect. 34, T.ISW., by virtue of a lease from the owner thereof, ob - jects to the construction of an electric transmission line "at any other point than within 10 feet from the boundary lines of the Northeast Quarter of Section 34, Township IS North, Range 54, West of the 6th Principal Meridian, in Kimball County, Nebraska." Mr. Gunderson alleges that the erection of a transmission line across said Quarter Section in any other location "would cause irreparable damage by in - terfering with the cultivation, irrigation and harvesting of crops to be raised thereon." Full hearing was given all interested parties and a long informal conference had by applicant, objectors, and the Commission. The Commission having given due weight and consideration to the filings and testimony in this matter and being fully advised in the premises finds: 1.

The Court, since the Question was before the State Supreme Court in a case then pending, to-wit, Miller vs. lowa-Nebraika Light and Power Company, No. 29360, entered a temporary order of injunction against members, of the Com - mission and the Attorney General enjoining them from enforcing the Commission's order oi April 25, 1934, until farther order of the Court The State Supreme Court in Millet vt, lowa-Nebratk* Light and Power Company. No. 29360 resolved the question of jurisdiction in favor of the Commission and held that the Commission haa full power .and authority to regulate rates for electrical energy charged rural customers such as the complainants in.

         <seg id="p362">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT The United States District Court, District of Nebraska, Lincoln Division, dismissed the action before it on November 14, 1936. : The District Court's order of dismissal in part said: "It appearing that the rate order of April 25, 1934, of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, which this suit was brought to enjoin, has been vacated by the Commission, and that therefore no further injunction could be awarded to prevent the enforcement of such order, it is, therefore, ordered that the temporary in - junction be dissolved and the plaintiffs bill be dis - missed, this court refusing to decide at this time wheth - er or not the temporary injunction was properly awarded. (See 32 Corp. jur. 435 Sec. 746), and it is further ordered that each party pay his own costs." The Commission's order of December 17, 1935, further provided "that the complaint be set down for hearing before the Commission at such future date as may hereafter be fixed by the Commission for the purpose of fixing a reasonable minimum charge."

There appear to be no laws nor regulations in conflict with the provision of the handbook relating to identification of ptiles, Section 28-280, A 6. reads as follows: </seg>
         <seg id="p364">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT "IDENTIFICATION OF POLES. Poles, towers and other supporting structures on which are maintained electrical conductors! shall be =0 constructed, located, marked, or numbered as to facili - tate identification by employees authorized to work thereon. Date of installation of such structures shall be recorded where practicable by the owner." The next paragraph reads as follows: "OBSTRUCTIONS. All poles shall be kept free from posters, bills, tacks, nails, and other unnecessary ob - structions, such as through bolts not properly trim - med." The safety oi the lineman who climb the poles is imperiled by metal obstructions which may cause the hooks on his climbers to slide, and possibly cause him to fall. This suggests that if metal is used at all that a minimum amount be utilized. Proper identification can easily be made by the use of paint and stencil, or by branding iron, thus eliminating entirety this objection. Yours very truly, WALTER R. JOHNSON Attorney General H. Emerson Kokjer Assistant Attorney General </seg>

Administration! </seg>
         <seg id="p390">THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT of the law was placed in the hands of the State Railway Commission, that body being given full authority to prescribe, rules and regulations deemed necessary to carry out the provisions of the act, and to fix fees for the service to be collected from the owners of the grain in an amount necessary to support the administration of the act. Inspectors were required to be appointed in each county, and each inspector was lo give a bond in such sum as may be required by the commission. Under the provisions of this act rules and rcgulatons were adopted fixing the amount of bond for each inspector at $1000.00, fixing the ice to be charged each applicant for a warehouse certificate at $4.00 /or the first crib or bin inspected, and $2.00 for each additional crib or bin inspected at the same time and at the same location, and pro - viding for the allowance of mileage to the inspector at the rate of five cents per mile, which was to be prorated if two or more inspec - tions were made on the same trip. Inspectors were appointed under this act in all of the grain pro - ducing counties in the state, and for a time a great deal of grain was kept in warehouses upon the farms, and the, warehouse receipts issued liy the Nebraska State Railway Commission were widely used as col - lateral for loans. In the past few years, however, probably as a re - sult of a changed loan policy by the Commodity Credit Corporation,' farm warehousing as provided for under this act has been little used. There being no business for them to handle, the expense of inspectors' bonds was not warranted so they were not reappointcd; and sup - plies, such as warehouse receipts and seals for cribs, were, not re - plenished. The law is still in effect, however, and this service can again be be given to the farmers and other owners of grain if there is a sufficient demand for it A request of ten or more farmers operating farm land tributary to any market center, or any less number of farmers having at least five thousand bushels of grain for storage, would make it mandatory under the act that the commission cause such grain to be inspected as soon as practicable. The commission may, at its discretion, inspect the grain of any one applicant, but the charges which would have to be made for inspectinp a small amount of grain would be out of proportion to the value of the service, and no one who is advised of the situation is likely to request that this be done.
