            <seg id="p003">An Analysis of Successful Co-Opera - tive Companies in Nebraska INTRODUCTION In the early fall, material was gathered and a bulletin published dealing with co-operation in Nebraska. This was a record of a survey to determine classification, relative suc - cess and number of co-operative concerns. In the spring of 1921 a somewhat similar bulletin was published containing data as gathered on the 1920 business report. This survey was more detailed, giving such information as the number of stockholders, value of stock, total capital and much other valuable data. The present bulletin is based on a selection of reports indicating unusual features of the business. Material was secured from these reports and analyzed in order to arrive at the reason or action underlying the results as observed. Personal visits were also made to some of the concerns in order to verify written reports previously made and to se - cure further data. On these visits particular attention was paid to th^-accounting system used, the training and educa - tion of the manager, the location of the store or elevator, ttnd the loyalty of the members. Some of the causes of fail - ure are; excessive extension of credit, overhead expenses out of proportion to size of income or volume of business, over expansion and under capitalization, no reserve or al - lowance for depreciation, scattered buying or selling, and poor accounting methods. Possibly one of the greatest among these is found in the method or lack of method in ac - counting and auditing of accounts. The manner in which the above causes were overcome successfully was of especial interest. . Care has been taken not to record the data se - cured in such a manner that particular concerns can be identified. The idea has been to make this bulletin one of suggestions and conclusion based on the information secured </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 STATE OF NEBRASKA through correspondence and personal inspection. Should a suggestion be given that certain principles, when applied, act as causes to bring about certain results, this suggestion will be based upon the knowledge that those results have been secured in the past under the conditions as above stated. According to this idea, the different conditions en - countered with their consequent effects, will be considered under the various sub-topics. GENERAL IMPRESSION The first impression is the most lasting one. If a store radiates an air of success this will have its effect upon the possible customer or the by-stander who either boosts or knocks. Many factors enter into this first impression. It is not based on the material of construction only, but on other things such as location, the neat arrangement of arti - cles in the windows and the spirit of activity and optimism prevailing. Location plays an important part. A poor lo - cation may result in great loss of trade. A cheap location is not always the best, neither is a high priced location. Some stores may be located a block or two from the main street and the location still be an exceptionally good one, due to the number of people passing the door. A store built in such a manner that additions can easily be made as growth con - tinues is a good investment. Material also enters into con - sideration, as it is in keeping with prosperity that the con - struction and material should be neat and substantial. Good display windows form a valuable asset to any store. A building out of date gives the impression that the entire business is such. This applies to both stores and elevators. Too many seem to think that if an elevator office is kept clean and neat it will embarrass possible customers. This is not the case. A neat office always makes its appeal and symbolizes a neat, accurate, systematic manager in control. I ARRANGEMENT The kind and arrangement of counters and of the goods on counters and shelves has much to do with success or </seg>

            <seg id="p006">6 STATE OF NEBRASKA failure. The successful co-operative store has its counters well arranged and the goods on the counter are also arranged in an attractive manner, counters are kept clean and shelves are well dusted. Actual dust on the goods in a store gives the impression, usually borne out, of theoretical dust on the brain, of the manager. Shop worn goods always leaves the impression that business is poor and stock turned slowly. If such goods are in the store they should be put upon a bar - gain counter and marked at a price that will sell them. Care should then be taken to prevent another accumulation of goods of this kind and condition. SERVICE It is not always necessary that extra service be given such as would entail extra expense and thus either raise the price to the consumer or decrease his patronage divi - dends. However, because the business is co-operative is no reason for a lack of service to the buying or selling public. The board of directors must have power to demand service from the manager and they in turn must give him power to demand and secure obedience from those working under him. This is a factor, the lack of which renders so much work of a public nature inefficient. Too many times when a demand for efficiency is made upon a subordinate, the one in control is the one who suffers from the interference of others. In order that any business can be run efficiently, the service given by employees must be efficient service. No subordinate in work of a public or semi-public nature, such as co-opera - tive work, should be allowed to go to directors or members for influence when the manager has criticised and corrected. Neither should any member assume to dictate the policy of the concern nor to manage the manager. To be a success, a co-operative concern must be run on a most efficient basis, the manager must have absolute authority in hiring and discharging as well as in buying and selling. His word must be law. Then, in case the plant is not run well, the simple remedy is to call the manager to account. In successful </seg>
            <seg id="p007">S* DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 7 stores and elevators this is done by means of an audit of the business, by a professional auditor. It is easily noticeable upon stepping into a successful Nebraska institution that one factor of its success lies in the fact that the manager is one of authority as well as of name. EQUIPMENT How would the modern Nebraska farmer feel if expected to care for a 160 acre farm with only a hoe as equipment? And yet the member of a co-operative concern will often place the manager and working force under just such a dis - advantage and expect success. The lack of equipment actu - ally costs more than the equipment itself when lack of efficiency is considered. The manager knows what is needed for successful business. The amount and kind needed may vary with the nature and volume of the business. If he does not know or care, he should be discharged and another se - cured. One of Nebraska's successful co-operative stores has as complete a set of equipment as is found in the modern city private store. This includes even the overhead carrier of goods and change. At a glance it is seen that this equip - ment promotes efficiency. This is divided into two main classes: mechanical equipment and business forms. Typewriters, adding machines, filing equipment and check protectors are a necessary part of the mechanical equipment of store, elevator or lumber yard. In a store of any size, the overhead carrier also promotes efficiency. Business forms cost approximately a small amount and are very essential in a properly conducted business. Among such forms are included annual report forms, membership register, constitution and by-laws, purchase requisitions, order blanks, settlement memorandums, duplicating sales slips and other forms having to do with a complete account - ing system. These are necessary in any business such as stores, elevators, creameries or lumber yards. In elevators, none but the best and latest equipment should be installed. </seg>

            <seg id="p009">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ■ FINANCIAL One of the main troubles with the co-operative concerns is that they expect to do business on too small a capital. Members do not have a clear idea of the amount of money needed to conduct a business. Very few realize that dis - counts on bills amount to a neat sum, but that these dis - counts cannot be taken unless the manager can secure avail - able cash to carry them. Neither do they realize the cus - tomers' call for credit. Each one apparently believes that he is the only one who makes such a call and sometimes cannot understand why he does not succeed in obtaining all the credit which he wishes. But when he brings in his grain he expects cash or its equivalent. The necessary buildings, equipment and machinery also take too large a percent of the capital and leave too small a working capi - tal. The result is that the manager must borrow money at* all times to secure a working capital which should have been furnished by a sale of stock. Many times he is forced to sell or buy at times which are disadvantageous to him and as a result loses money when he could have made a profit. This reacts on him unfavorably, lowers the value of the stock or at least stops patronage dividends and in some cases no interest is paid on stock. When this time occurs the members become pessimistic and even knock on the business. The solution for much of this trouble lies in an increased capital. Many concerns do not issue all of the authorized capital. Capital charge in itself is one of the smallest of expense items. It must be realized that capital borrowed costs as much or more than capital secured by the sale of stock. When capital is borrowed it may be called in at the time wjhen most needed. At the present time many organizations in both private and co-operative lines of busi-^ ness are undergoing the effects of a lack of capital due to the fact that credit has been curtailed and they had con - sidered this credit as a part of their working capital. This is especially true in handling grain or lumber. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">STATE OF NEBRASKA 10 PAR VALUE OF STOCK If stock sold cheaply, the idea would seem to be that this would result in more membership and consequently more business, but this is not always the case. It appears that the good derived is more than offset by the disadvant - ages. Among these are the fact that it lessens capital as it appears to be harder to sell stock for a certain amount of capital than to sell a smaller number of shares to raise the same amount. One scheme which is used in a successful co-operative store is to allow a non-member to buy stock in the concern by paying $1.00 down on a share. Patronage dividends are based on the goods bought from the concern. As far as these are concerned, the man who has paid one dollar on his share has equal opportunities with the man who has bought and paid for many shares. As far as stock is concerned the one owning the most shares naturally gets the most in stock dividends or interest. But by the scheme above outlined the business becomes truly co-operative in declaring the patronage dividend and yet does not go to the extent of paying dividends to non-members. Any one truly interested in success of co-operation will not object to pay - ing his dollar on a share when he realizes all the benefits derived therefrom. In this connection it should be stated that successful co-operation is invariably the result of ne - cessity. If a person does not realize the necessity for co - operation he will not be sufficiently interested to become a member and undergo the hardships or reverses which are liable to be met with in any pioneering enterprise. DEPRECIATION AND OTHER FUNDS During the past few years the merchant or grain dealer who was looking into the future laid aside a little for the proverbial rainy day of falling prices. He did not attempt to fool himself into the belief that everything could be sold at a profit no matter how or when purchased. He also set aside a fund to cover depreciation due to wear on buildings or goods. In many instances this was hard for the co-op- </seg>
            <seg id="p011">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 11 A Modern Co-operative Elevator erative manager to do, owing to the fact that his members or directors did not realize the business necessity for such action and preferred to see this money paid out in divi - dends, but in cases where he was really the manager he did as all efficient business men should do and thus averted loss and possible catastrophe. The successful concern invariably sets aside a reserve for unexpected losses. Why should not the co-operative concern do likewise? </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 STATE OF NEBRASKA MANAGER In many instanes the selection of a poor manager has foredoomed the venture. A good doctor may make the poorest of farmers. Because a man is a good farmer is no sign that he can successfully manage a co-operative busi - ness. There are at present, concerns in Nebraska in which the main cause for failure lies in the poor managerial abil - ity. As opposed to this there have come under observation many cases of unusual success based on good managerial ability. What constitutes a good manager is the question asked. Some of the points observed in those who had made a peculiar success were: education, training, experi - ence, natural executive ability, honesty, energy and aggres - siveness. Education in itself does not always imply that the manager should have secured his knowledge inside of four walls of a school or college. Statistics show, however, that the educated man surpasses the uneducated man in all business or professional lines. This education may have been obtained through a series of troubles and semi-fail - ures, possibly at the expense of others. Experience, especially when coupled with education, means much in leading to success or failure. There are many troubles besetting the path of a manager which may be met more easily or entirely avoided if he is guided by past experience. Natural executive ability is an asset which everybody does not possess. It is very necessary in con - ducting a private business and most necessary in conducting a co-operative concern where the manager must deal with so many different factors. Honesty, energy and aggressive - ness are necessary for success in any line and are especially needed in this line of work. OVERHEAD EXPENSE Many institutions have failed because the overhead ex - pense, the volume of business and the total income and capital invested were not in proportion to each other. A $40,000 merchandise business cannot very well carry a </seg>
            <seg id="p013">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 13 heavy overhead charge. But a $300,000 business can carry a large overhead expense. The ratio of expense to sales must be definitely known in order to establish the profit margin in a ratio of gross profit to sales. A large^^ercent of gross profit sometimes amounts to nothing if the ratio of expense to sales is large. On the other hand, a small percent of gross profit may mean a reasonable patronage dividend and a successful business, providing the gross ex - pense is correspondingly small. An expense of thirty five to forty thousand dollars per year is not so heavy when dis - tributed over a $300,000 business thus making the ratio of about 12 per cent. When the same overhead is charged against a $100,000 business, it is easy to see what the consequences will be. A 14 per cent to 16 per cent gross profit is not so large if the margin between profit and expense is only 2 to 4 per cent. But when this margin is applied to a $200,000 to $300,000 business it is seen to mean a nice little profit. If the margin of expense is high, the margin of gross income must be correspondingly high. There is a point above which the manager dare not go or he will be pricing his goods too high for successful competition. There is also a point below which he dare not go if buying grain or his customers will all go to the man who pays the most. In his expense budget he must not go too low for in this he loses efficiency and brings about a reaction on his income. CO-OPERATION OF MEMBERS What is a co-operative organization? This is the ques - tion which every would-be member should ask himself before joining or in any manner affiliating with an organization of that kind. If he considers such an organization merely a means to further selfish purposes of his own, then the best thing to do is not to join. Co-operation means, as the word indicates, that the member must co-operate or work with other members. This means sacrifice in some cases as the member must be willing to take small losses should they occur. He must remember that the organization is his, in- </seg>
            <seg id="p014">STATE OF NEBRASKA sofar as he is a part owner. In one instance that comes to mind, the member went eight miles further to buy an article costing over $300.00 because he could get this article $4.00 cheaper than at his own concern. A 4 per cent patronage dividend would have meant a $12.00 rebate. As he and other members went where they could buy cheaper in com - petition the result was the loss of money to their own con - cern and consequently to themselves. It is interesting to note that the competitor's regular price on the article above mentioned was $325.00. The co-operative concern's regular price was- $310.00. Too often the idea prevailing in the organization of a co-operative concern is that the new enterprise will soon put the competitor out of business. When members start an or - ganization of this kind they may lose sight of the fact that they are entering into competition against men experienced in their line of business. They are undertaking an enter - prise new and consequently foreign to the existing order of business. They are not in the position of private business with but one interest to serve, but rather have many minds and ideas to consider. In a recent questionnaire a question was asked relating to the furthering of co-operation in Ne - braska. Over 50 per cent of those replying expressed the idea in positive terms that co-operators should be taught loyalty to their business and to the principles of co-opera - tion. Apparently the managers concerned had learned by sad experience that the co-operative idea had not been firm - ly rooted and that the members were too much inclined to take a selfish view of the situation. As a result of this per - verted view, the member lost sight of the good of his organ - ization in his effort to benefit himself. Such is not a co - operative spirit. I </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 16 ACCOUMlNG Since income tax must be figured annually, the reasons for keeping accurate accounting records appear more evi - dent to the .-average person than was formerly the case. NieverfnVless, there is always need for improvement in many dtees. The annual audit serves this purpose, but it comes but once a year. Books should be so kept that the manager may easily find out the condition of the business at any time and also be able to trace the cause for this condition. Cost accounting is just as important as profit or gross income accounting. The argument is sometimes advanced that a knowledge of a loss in one department of a business con - cern would be of no benefit and consequently there would be no need for departmental cost accounting. The reason given is that the department in question would have to be carried any way in order to satisfy the 'demands of customers. If this is true, there is really a greater reason for cost account - ing under these conditions. If the concern must carry a cer - tain department it is up to that concern to make this de - partment pay and the reason is more urgent since the mat - ter is of a compulsory nature. Cost accounting would be at least a step in finding the cause of the loss. When this cause is found there is always a remedy of some kind which can be applied. Some very complete systems were in use in organiza - tions visited. These, however, varied in their number and use and thus did not tend to promote uniformity. If com - parisons are to be made in any manner there must first be a common or uniform method adopted in order to admit of comparison as it is only by measuring our business by others that we are able to grow. A uniform system serves the same purpose in aiding growth and correcting errors that is served by a cost ac - counting system. It is not intended to be urged that a sys - tem as adopted should go too much into detail in its cost accounting methods. Extremes either way are unprofitable </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 STATE OF NEBRASKA and there is such a thing as attempting to carry a system unwarranted by the size of the business. The United States Government has a system of accounting for elevators which has been adopted by many elevators in the state. This system is published as U. S. Departmental Bulletin number 811. It is not of a complex nature and yet is complete in all its features. SALARIES One very important item of overhead expense is the salary budget. In many cases this forms a large percent of the overhead charges. The trouble does not usually lie in the large salary providing the manager is efficient and hon - est. In this case he can secure value returned for the amount of money invested in salaries of himself and sub - ordinates. Too/ma,ny times the salary is entirely inade - quate. As a result/ the man is attracted to other fields, us - ually that of private profit enterprises. It must be remem - bered that as long as salaries are low, the co-operative con - cern must expect competition from private organizations. If a man is successfully carrying on the business he must be paid for it. Cheap help is the most expensive help obtain - able. A man may be secured for $50.00 to $100.00 per month and through his inexperience and lack of judgment he may cause a loss of hundreds and even thousands per month. Or he may be hired at $200.00 per month and make many times that amount as profit to his firm. In se - lecting a manager the directors must be sure they have the best and then be willing to pay a good price. ORGANIZATION In the previous pages, causes and effects pertaining to success or failure of co-operation have been described. In order that any concern may be a success it must be well organized, both fmra. a legal standpoint and from a business standpoint. V </seg>
            <seg id="p017">©EPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IT Under the laws recently passed by the 1921 Session of the Nebraska legislature, "and in accordance with the amend - ed constitution, co-operative business concerns can be or - ganized with legal recognition and protection of all the Roch - dale principles of co-operation. Co-operative banks can also be organized with separate recognition as such given it by the state banking board. Copies of these laws may be se - cured from the Bureau of Markets, State Department of Agriculture. There is now no reason why a concern cannot organize as co-operative business and be legally sound. The next step is to see that the business organization is sound and able to function properly. This would relate of course to the external and internal organization. Under the ex - ternal organization is considered the points which come di - rectly under legal organization when filing articles of in - corporation. Many of these points are, however, optional with the organization before filing. Among them is the question of the election of the board of directors. It has been found to be a wise policy to elect a third of the board each year. This leaves two thirds of the board with at least a year's experience in handling affairs of the busi - ness. Under the internal organization would be considered all those things which pertain to the internal workings of a business organization of any kind. These are fundamental - ly the same in any business whether of a private or co - operative nature. Listed below is a summary of the factors which enter into the conducting of a successful business. Success in co-operation means an organization providing for and embodying the following: Manager — He must be experienced, educated, energetic and possess executive ability. Employees — Should be responsible, willing to be instruc - ted and take orders, not easily offended, energetic and ex - periened if possible. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 STATE OF NEBRASKA Members — Are expected to be business-like enough to realize that a boost for their organization means a boost for their pocket book. Co-operators enough to realize that self - ishness and co-operation are enemies. They must remem - ber that it is a long road to success altho it is a long road that has no turning. Directors — At starting, all experience possible is need - ed. After starting, two thirds of board should always be experienced men. Capital — Sell enough stock to provide adequate capital. Surveys show that a large percent of co-operative concerns in Nebraska are under-capitalized. Lay by a surplus as rap - idly as possible. Borrowed money demands interest. Capi - tal stock demands no more. Sell more capital stock and avoid borrowing continuously. Discounts — Provide for discounting invoices and thus provide additional income. Accounting — Install an up to date, adequate, uniform ccounting system. Do not make it too intricate and thus ncrease overhead charges by unnecessary bookkeeper ex - pense. Do not make it too simple and thus eliminate ne - essary features. Keep departmental cost accounts. Be ble to know whether the concern is losing or making, and why and where. Do not establish new departments until eeded. When they are established, back them up and buy rom them. If they are needed they should be self-support - ng. If they are not self-supporting, they are a luxury. Equipment — Provide for sufficient equipment including the accounting system before mentioned. As the store or other business grows, the need for more equipment becomes evident. The manager and directors must be able to discern between necessary time-saving equipment and that which is unnecessary. An overhead carrier is a necessity in one store. It may be a luxury and expense in another. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">r DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 19 Gross Profits and Expense — The manager and directors gross profits needed in the business as com- pared with the gross expenses. Percent margin profit varies nth volume of business. Competition determines the sell - ng price. Many factors enter into buying prices, among hese being the buying ability of manager or buyer. The members themselves have much to do with determining I'olume. The manager and directors must determine ex- i )ei Reserve — Provision should be made and carried out for the setting aside of reserve funds and depreciation funds. A good reserve aids in establishing stability while if depre - ciation is not met by a certain amount each year the amount is all required at one time. This usually is a serious blow financially. Auditing — As a straight business proposition, every such organization should be audited by professional audit - ors at least annually, and in some cases quarterly. Only by a complete audit can a check be secured indicating success or failure of the business. Be sure the audit is made by those who know the business. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">STATE OF NEBRASKA CONCLUSIONS 1. Necessity is the basis of successful co-operation. 2. Make haste slowly. Rome was not built in a day. Neither can a co-operative organization expect to become all powerful in a short time. 3. Select a good manager. Then pay him for\his services. A poor manager is costly at any price. 4. All members must be loyal to their organization and manager. 5. Put in a complete, uniform accounting system. See that the one in charge knows how to keep the books prop - erly and does so. 6. Successful concerns see that their employees rer der service to customers. 7. There is now no reason why o-operative concerns cannot incorporate all the true principles of co-operation in their corporate organization. 9. The manager cannot do it alone. Neither tan the board of directors, nor an individual member. All must pull 10. Overhead expenses must be in proportion to gross profit and volume. 11. When you go into business, patronize yourself. If you don't no one else will be likely to do so. </seg>
