For convenience, however, and in order to make our report thorough and complete with respect to our financial trans - actions, it has been thought best to cover the period Iwirin ■ing April 1st, 15&gt;K{, when the appropriations for the pres - ent liienniimi became available, it being easily determined the amounts of the expenditures from these various appropria - tions made by others from April 1st. 1913, until the law under which we operate became effective. Fifteen different state institutions came under the control and management of the Bonn), one of which, however, the Home for Dependent Children, was not taken charge of by us until May 1st, 1914, nor does the above include a reform;) lory for tirst offenders, the establishment and locatim which was provided for by the last legislature and an appro priation made to carry the same into effect. On November 30th, 1914, there was a total present inmate population in these fifteen institutions of l..~&gt;21. There were also on that date inmates who were out on parole to the imiiiiIm'I' of TlS iii;ikiii (i a total inuiati* rtnniilatioii of !"» </seg>

It is tlius disc I that the increase in inmate population of these several insti tutions amounts to approximately 12 |mm- cent durin» the biennial period. The several institui ions under the control of the Hoard ina.v be grouped or classified somewhat as follows: Hduca- Bl, such as the school for blind and deal at Nebraska »'it.\ and at Omaha; Educational and Corrective, as are the in - dust rial set Is for boys and girls at Kearney and at Geneva; Educational and Reformatory, such as the Nebraska it trial home at Ifilford and the reformatory for first offenders, when established; Charitable, such as the soldiers" and sail homes at Bnrketi and at Ifilford, and the hospital for tuberculous patients at Kearney; Educational and charitable as the institution for feeble-minded at Beatrice, orthopedic hospital and home For dependent children at Lincoln; for the • are and restoration of the mentally unsound, such as the hospitals for the insane, of which there are three, locate ! respectively at Lincoln, Injjleside and Norfolk; Penal ami Reformatory, the same Ihmiij; the Nebraska state prison hi eated at Lincoln. The scope of the work being as diversified I is shown to Im- by the foregoing, will give some idea of the immense amount of detail that is absolutely essential in carrying on successfully the work of management ami rnment of these several different public activities Ionditions confronting the Hoard at the beginning of its k seemed to require that its first efforts should be e*pe |y directed to the subject of systematizing, standardising rendering uniform, as much as circumstances would per - the btisiness operations and affairs of these fifteen differ - institutions.

In the purchase of supplies it has been the polici "f the Board to regard quality as a predominating factor and to purchase only such as were of good ualit.v and l&gt;est . al culated to serve the purpose for which obtained, paying then for wlmt tlie article was fairly worth rather than to en in an effort to buy solely with refernce to the rheapin - the thing purchased.

We are convinced that this policy ha* home good fruit and that in the long run the purchase! made and the expenditures required therefor have resulted in the state securing a better article for less money than otherwise would he the case. In making expenditures for general repairs, stability. durability and permanency have l&gt;een the general objects kept in view even though more money is required therefor, rather than to make repairs of a temporary and evanescent char - acter at a lesser expense In the construction of new build ings we have given much thought to the uses and pur] for which the structures are erected, rendering them as nearly perfectly adapted for the anticipated use as is jiossible under </seg>

The new building at the penitentiary was con structed under the direction of a foreman by skilled me fhanira where that wrts necessary, aided by the use of prison labor in so far as it could be utilized to advantage. While the business and financial part of the work has re reived our best attention, consideration and judgment we have not in the discharge of our duties lost Blghi of the fact that other equally important factors were to be recogniaed and considered if we are to attain that degree of success in the general work to be done that ought to be striven for. and to fully carry out the object of the law providing for the many as can 1m- made tit to become useful and helpful in the maintenance of these public institutions. The proper care, treatment, and attention, which should be given to the dif - ferent inmates of these several institutions have received «M|ually careful thought and consideration at our hands in an effort, wherever possible, to improve conditions, provi le proper care for those who remain and restore to society as ordinary walks of life. With the view of keeping ourselves fully informed ao t" conditions and the situation with respect to the care and treatment of the different wards of the state, aside from the ml personal visits which are made from time to time by the members of the Board in a l&gt;odv and more frequently by some only of the different ineml&gt;erK, we have prepared and require submission tons at stated times certain forms of re - ports relating to the admission of inmates to the several in institutions to their care while in the custody of the sfcite and </seg>

These different financial statements together with the others more in detail accom panying this report disclose the actual transactions and facts with regard to all expenditures and it is believed that they will be quite helpful in determining the actual wants and needs and the necessary reasonable expenditures that are re - quired in order to properly carry on the future work in these several institutions. We have given the matter much study with the object of ascertaining wherever we can where ex peases may be reduced without in anywise militating against the efficient control and management of the institution under consideration. They are helpful in a comparative way in that the different expenditures for the same purj&gt;ose in the different institutions may be examined and compared, bear iag in mind always, however, that tlie ]&gt;opulation, the amount required lor salaries and vmgei and local conditions ami environment have a very material bearing upon the propriety and reasonableness of the expenditures thus made.

BM.MATKS OF EXPENDITURE** ItEQriRED DUB ING THEOOMINfl BIENNIAL I'KKIoh We present herewith a statement Knowing the needs and requirements of the different institutions in the way ot propriations to meet necessary expenditure* during the liieiinum beginning April 1st. 1915, and ending March 3 In the estimate presented we have grouped or classified the exjM'iises to lie met and provided for into what we have denominated "Ordinary Kxpenses" and "Extraordinary l'\ |K'tises."' the latter including disbursements for the construe tion of new buildings or permaneni additions to present ones together with other permaneni and lasting improvem&lt; and the purchase of land, the items of which are specifically stated. In the clam denominated "Ordinary Kxpenses" is in eluded all other excuses connected with the management, control, maintenance and rapport of these several iustitu tions. It is deemed advisable by us to keep separate tin penditures made for permanent and lasting improvements, new structures, the purchase of land, etc., from the genera] disbursements made from day to day of current exp&lt; and which in the main are common to all institutions As a part of the estimates of ordinary expenditures we present an analysis or detailed statement of the different items ami purjM&gt;ses of expenditures &lt;roinir to make up the sum total of •ill tie ordiirirv exitend it nres of rsch institution While </seg>

Circumstance* tin foneefl and which cannot be taken into account man; time* enter into the qneatfcMn of fntnre expenditure* which time alone ran determine. It is for reasons of this nature that we have grossed the expenditure* in total sums with the view of enabling us in directing and providing for future expenditures and the actual necessities of the institutions to have a degree of elasticity whereby if a Buying can !&gt;»■ ef - fected with respect to one item and extraordinary demands arise which require a greater expenditure than anticipated as to another item then the loss in one will equal the gain in the other so that in the end we will be enabled to meet all proper demands without incurring deficiencies as to some particular item to be met and provided for by future legisla - tion. Tt may also l&gt;e suggested that were all of the sums or totals estimated as the required expenditures of the s&lt;\ eral different institutions nterged into a grand total for all institutions, to l&gt;e used wherever occasion arises to meet the reasonable and necessary requirements as to the expenditures of each institution, this would give us greater opportunities for meeting extraordinary demands in one instance by our ability to curtail in others and thus with more certainty meet the requirements and actual necessities for the entire biennial jteriod out of the a jrirrefra t e amount thus provided for. In concluding our statement regarding legislative appro - priations for future ne&lt;nls of the institutions under the con trol of the Board, we beg to res]HMtfully state and surest with earnestness and sincerity that in arriving at the amounts required to meet the wants and needs of the institu - tions we have in all instances most carefully and thoroughly considered every factor entering into the question in order </seg>

It is to be said also that it may Im - true t hat much larger sums than have been requested bj Hoard conld he used wisely and judiciously and would hi material benefit in carrying on and advancing the work in this branch of the state's business. We, however, have tell that appropriations may 1m- swollen to the point of Im-mil' bur - densome to the tax-payer and it is preferable fo ask for the lowest sum which seems reasonably consistent with the proper dtaeharge &lt;&gt;f the work and to keep buildings and im - provements in suitable condition and repair, and enl; meiit of capacity gradually rather than to udertake much during any one biennium.

Much in the wa\ of repair and improvement has been done during the p;ist biennium. A visit to the institution and persona] touch with the work being done for these unfortunates will Impress one with the necessity and importance of making adequate pro vision for the future. The rej&gt;ort of the su]&gt;erintendent is referred to for a more detailed statement of the local situa - tions as it affects this institution. Some further improvements seem quite essential at this institution in order that the work may be carried on satisfac - torily. The population of the institution has increased to tin point where its capacity is taxed to the limit. The demand for additional admissions are steady and will continue from time to time as the state grows in population. With a view of relieving the congested condition and making suitable pro visions for future admissions the Uoard deems it quite im - portant that an additional building should he constructed which may be used as a school building and as an auditorium and which they have estimated to cost *40,000.ooo.

It should also Ik* noted here that the inniat. - population of this institution is such as that additional land to that BOW owned by the state could be used to &lt;;o&lt;m1 advan taire for jtasturaire and to raise the ordinary crops and furnish employment for the inmates. Being unable, however, to oh tain any definite information as to the purchase of additional land available for this purpose and of the consideration re - ipiired to be paid for such land, we have withheld our recom - mendation to you and to the legislature until such time ;i - may obtain definite and sjx'cific information with regard thereto and to feel that as a business propositios the pro d expenditure for such purpose is wise and judicious With resjM'ct to the objects to l&gt;e attained and the purpose for which the Institution for Feeble- Minded is maintained, we desire to submit for the serious consideration of the ( lovernor and file legislature the following observations which pecu - liarly affect society in its treatment &lt;»f This class of wards of the state. The inmate population has now grow II to the number of 470 and including those who are out on parole, 49"&gt;, and, as al&gt;ove stated, has about reached the limit of its capacity.

Daring the past bienuuini there were committed to the hospital at Lincoln 2~&gt; of these "developmental defec - tives"; to the hospital at Norfolk 22: and to the hospital at Injjleside 20. Daring the smne period the accessions to the institute at Beatrice were 161. These 228 person* were all placed in these several institutions by reason of their mental defects.

Of this imhnIh'1- only six passed the test ap - plicable to children of 15 years. These were recorded as nut retarded. Of the nunil»er examined nearly three -fourths i "Ml per cent. I were mentally under 1 1* years of age; nearly one-half &lt; 17. 2 per cent.) were Mentally under Id yeai&gt; at ; and two were mentally but •"&gt; years of a ire. Enilar tests, if applied to our population in the industrial la and in the penitentiary would unquestionably reveal s who are feeble-minded and who ouirht not to he re ■d to society. Feeble-mi ndedness is known to be chiefly a matter of he redicty. It seems, therefore, inexcusable folly to permit a feeble -minded pet SOB to become a parent. In this reaped the high-grade feeble-minded is the greater menace to society, for often the mentai deficiency is accompanied by physical attractiveness and charm witli but little self-control or self restraint. The feeble-minded girl is especially in need of protection. The statistics concerning the Milford Some and they confirm the results of similar in vest illations else where corroborate this statement. The only effective measures to meet these conditions are egMtiofl and sterilization; but in our state neither of these may be applied except as a voluntary proceding on the part of the lejral guardian of the feeble-minded peraoa.

HOSPITALS FOK THE INSANE. of the total inmate population of 5,239 in the several in stitutions under the control of the Board, 2,400 or nearly one-half belong to the three hospitals for the insane located respectively at Lincoln, Ingelside and Norfolk. Notwith - standing that during the past biennium by the erection of new buildings, especially at Lincoln, the capacity for housing patients has been materially increased, yet the demand for new admissions has been so constant that each of the insti - tutions mentioned is at the present time taxed to its full ca parity and especially is this the case at the Lincoln hospital, where the situation has become acute by reason of the over crowded condition and the inability of the management to receive new patients, applications for which are constantly being made. To relieve the over-crowded condition and pro - vide capacity for the constantly increasing number of this class of the wards of the state, this Hoard has deemed it not only wise but an actual duty, owing by the state to these helpless people, to make provisions for additional room and to that end in our estimates of needed appropriations for the coming biennium we have asked for sums to provide two new buildings at the Lincoln hospital and one at the Norfolk hos pital. The situation is such that it is believed that the erec - tion of two new buildings at the Lincoln hospital for the use of untidy patients, or possibly one building for this especial purpose and one for dipsomaniacs or employes, which need not be of a very costly character, will, for the time being, serve present purposes and relieve in a measure the congested condition now existing.

With the additional room thus provided for the state could accommodate and care for ap - proximately l'"&gt;o patients in addition to the present popula - tion. In providing for the enlargement of the institution of this character the Board is of the opinion that it would be in the interest of economy and an improved administration of the affairs of these institutions to make provisions for an increased population at Norfolk, which now has only and at Lincoln, which has 7T8, rather than to further in crease the capacity at [ngieside, which at the present I eares for a population of 1.202. By the adoption of such a policy the population of these three institutions will be brought nearer together which, in our judgment, would re - sult in a more economical administration than would l&gt;e the case if the disparity in the number of patients at each of the institutions were maintained at relatively the same rat the present. Reason* of this character have led us U) recout mend that provision be made for increased capacity at Lin - coln and Norfolk, tearing Ingleside as it now stands for the next two years at least. While the erection of new building year after year will, no doubt, be necessary in order to keep pace with the de - mands of an increasing population, it is also quite evident that more consideration should be given to the eaUMS which </seg>

There is, of course, the exercise of more or less restraint by those in authority over the liberty of action of these boys while in custodial care. Just what de - gree of liberty and freedom may be accorded consistent with the proper government of the institution and in securing the results has not yet been worked out to our entire satis faction. How far these young boys mav be trusted and confi - dence reposed in them without its being abused and how heartily and generally. they will respond to a system of gov - ernment placing them upon honor rather than being held under forcible restraint, are problems which we hope to grad - ually work out in a way that will bring about more content - ment and love for the life of the school and more nearly fit them for useful citizenship. We hope to evolve a system of discipline and management that will develop self-reliance, ugthen then morally and better enable them to over - come the weakness and waywardness which have led to their being placed in the institution. Efforts are constantly being made for improvement ; for the better education of these boys and young men and especially to instruct them along useful lines of industry; and to fit them for different trades and oc - cupations. Much is being done in an industrial way, farm operations being conducted on a large and extensive scale, including not only the raising of crops of various kinds but also engaging in dairying and stock-raising. All of these activities are found to afford useful and healthful employ- ment during the greater portion of the year.

            <seg id="p031">31 &lt; &gt;ne of the most important matters in connect ion with tin- administration of a prison is the employment of the in m;itcs. The average inmate population of our penitentiary for the year ending November 30. 1914, was 349. Of I about 100 were given employment in connection with the ad - ministration of the prison, in doing work in the kitchen and dininjr-rooin. in tlie cell -houses, the boiler-boaae, the laundry, the yard, the barn, the farm, the jrarden, etc. There remained, therefore, al&gt;out 2r&gt;0 persons to he otherwise employed. For many years the system of contract Ial&gt;or has been in force in this state. When this Board entered upon its duties there were two such contracts outstanding; one with the Lee I.room and Duster Company and the other witli the Hand craft Furniture Company. Of these contracts the former has already expired and the latter will end next June The two industries together employed practically all of the men who were capable of working and whose services were not necessary to the prison itself. The system of contract 1 was abolished by the legislature in 1!)ir» and it was provided that ii|M&gt;n the expiration of the contracts then in force, the aid order should terminate. The statute further proi that the warden should employ such convicts as are n ■ary in the manufacture of all clothing, shoes and furniture for aae in the prison and other state institutions and rach other articles used by the state or state institutions that it is possible to manufacture, and that he mi^ht manufacture for sale any article not manufactured in the state and that would not compete with industries already established Ir was also provided that the warden should procure machii prepare shop rooms and employ such persons as might be necessary to instruct the convicts in sock manufacture, but no appropriation was made to carr\ into effect these pro - visions. It is &lt;)iiite essential that the inmates not alone of the penitentiary but of all of our state institution I KIM &gt;&gt; LA 1»&lt; IK. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 sii fur ;ts their jili ysical iiml mental condition will warrant. In the institution for feeble-minded and in the several hos - pitals for the insane there are many inmates who MO and d&lt;&gt; laiN&gt;r efficiently to the advantage of the state and to the bemefli of their own physical and mental well-being. At the h industrial achooJ there is a considerable number of active. energetic boys who are l&gt;ein£ instructed in various lines .if ill effort. Among the industries of the institution are a shoe shop anil a tailor shop where the shoes and the clothing of the population are made. In this institution and in the school for the deaf, instruction is jriven in cabinet-making, aawmg other thing*, illl( l some articles of furniture are made at these institutions for their own use. It seems to us that in providing necessary employment for the prisoners in the penitentiary care should he taken not t&lt;&gt; interfere with the operations and employments already in us.- in other state institutions where the proper employment of the inmates is really as essential as in the penitentiary. |&gt;me machinery has been purchased and installed by the ilen and the making of furniture for state use has been in on a small scale. Some articles of furniture have been died to the Board from this shop ami a number of piece* in course of construction for the school for the blind, hut number who can he furnished employment in this way is small. After giving this serious problem much consideration, we are of the opinion that to restrict the products of prison labor to state use would he impracticable; that the demands of the state institutions would not be sufficient to keep em ployed the number of persons available for such employment ; or would result in the accumulation of a lar&lt;;e supply of articles for which there would be no demand; or would in - volve I lie establishment of a large number of industries, and their equipment with machinery and instructors at great ex - pense, and for a very small out-put. This Board heartily approves the actions of the legislature in doin&lt;; awav with contract labor in the prison and belieVM </seg>
            <seg id="p033">33 that the system of letting to individuals the lalx&gt;r of prisoners iR fundamentally wrong in principle. We also believe that whatever may l»e the case in other states, in Nebraska it will be impracticable to employ our prisoners In the manufacture of articles for stale use only. The only alternative i manufacture articles both for state use and for sale. The present statute limits the manufacture of articles for sale t«&gt; articles not manufactured in the state and not competing with industries already established. These limitations are «» comprehensive that there is almost no field of manufacture left open to the state, and they Been to us inconsistent with the broader purpose* of such employment. If a term of imprisonment is to accomplish any good result it must 1m' by making the prisoner more tit to live in society : it must at least equip him with habits of industry and the ability to earn a livelihood. From this point of view it would Seem that it is the duty of the state to employ its cntivii some kind of work in which they may find employment when they are again returned to society, rather than to employ them in lines of service or manufacture in which they cannot find employment when they are restored to the community To discharge a man from prison with ten dollars in money and with skill acquired for an industry not found in the state outside, and then expect him to be a self-supporting, MW-abiding citizen seems to us somewhat of a mockery Tbe sort of industry which should l&gt;e provided in the prison is not only one in which the discharged man may find employ inent after his release, but one which requires much manual labor and comparatively little machinery work which re quires some attention on the part of the laborer so that his mind may l&gt;e occupied and stimulated.

This Hoard lias in mind certain sorts of wholesome em - ployment which will require a maximum of hand labor and a minimum of machinery and of working capital, and recom - mends that the statutes of this state be amended so that it shall not be required that all clothing, shoes and furniture for use in other state institutions be manufactured by the penitentiary to the detriment of the labor of the inmates of such other institutions, nor that the manufacture of articles for sale by the penitentiary be restricted to articles not manufactured in the state and not competing with industrial already established. The removal of these limitations, it if to us, is absolutely necessary in order to provide proper employment for the prisoners, and will not subject outside industries to unfair or improper competition. The removal of a man from the avenues of ordinary occupation to an oc cupation conducted within prison walls will not increase competition, and if the articles manufactured by him are </seg>

The matter of compensating prisoners is in a more or experimental stage. The compensation should be large enough to afford a real incentive to the man but not so I as unduly to burden the state.

In the employment of prisoners by the state itself, it is contemplated, of course, that the earnings of the prisoners shall be paid into the cash fund of the institution to be used in the carrying on of the business, the compensation of pris - oners and the maintenance of the penitentiary. II the past the sums earned by prison contract labor have pone into the institution cash fund as in other institu r and as other earnings of the penitentiary have gone, but e sums have been deposited with the State Treasurer to credit of the general fund.

The engines are of an obsolete type, wasteful of fuel and in constant need of repair and must soon be replaced. I somewhat similar state of affair* exists at the Nebraska pital for the Insane at Lincoln, where the greatly in - sed demands upon the power plant, incident to the ere* and occupancy of the new buildings, have over-burdened equipment and have made it necessary either to enlarge power plant there or to procure current elsewhere. 143,351.85. </seg>

Hut to make the parole effective there should be provided as a part of tlie peniten tiary staff a parole officer who should be a man familiar with the prisoner, acquainted with his weaknesses and capabili - ties, a man of sympathy, of wise counsel, of firm purpose and of discriminating judgment, who would visit the prisoner at his home, consult with his employer, investigate his eiates and his manner of spending his idle hours, and. in a word, extend over the man an oversight and a friendly super - vision that would further reduce the number of failures.

If the T"ir pose of imprisonment in the penitentiary is the protection of society, the prevention of crime and the reformation of the individual, then certainly the imprisonment of one who &lt;m account of h ; s violation of the laws of the state, has h -en separated from his fellows, should continue so long as his at - titude towards society would make his return to the roaa munity dangerous, he that period one year or seven, or for life. The man who, at the expiration of a maximum sent is as much a thief as he was at the heirinninjr, is as danger - ous to society as he was then and outrht not to he permitted to return to the community and asrain ply his illicit trade. On the other hand, one who is manifestly so impressed and chastened by a short period of incarceration that it is evi - dent he can asain take his place in the community with credit to himself and with safety to society ought not to he hell in prison merely that the time fixed hv an arhitrary minimum estahlished without reference to the individual and without any logical hasis. should elapse.

This law has been the object of bitter attack and of heated defense. The members of this Board make no claim to rt knowledge of the pedagogical aspects of tlie subject, and the suggestions which we have to offer deal with the practical rather than the technical view. Bcidentally, it seems to us rather unwise for a legislative to prescribe by inflexible statute an exclusive method struction in any school. Conceding the greater desirability of the oral method and its wide applicability in practice, it occurs to us that in a given case a child might be unable to acquire speech or lip - ling to a profitable decree and yet might not be mentally defective by the IJinet scale nor physically mal-formed, aud might be capable of receiving a fair education through silent methods.

There will probably always be in the institution manual • lasses in which such .pupils might be taught According to the report of the superintendent about 83 per cent, of the pupils received since this law went into effect and now in school are in oral classes, and 15 per cent, are in manual • lasses. The deaf are not becoming more numerous, portionntely. and there is not in this state a sufficient num - ber to justify the creation of a separate school for er We accordingly recommend that the statute (Sec. 7IH8 Her.

We further recommend the repeal of Sec. 7210 of the Kev. St. Neb. 11)13, providing for certain payments by the - to parents or guardians who send their wards to oral schools in other states.

            <seg id="p044">44 KKPORT BOARD COMMISSIONERS that its management, government and control under the con - stitutional amendment belonged to this Hoard rather than to an independent organization under which it had been man aged before.

In carrying out the objects of the statute and while finding homes for those thus placed in the custody of the state, there l&gt;een kept under the direct and immediate control of the officers of the Home an average of about 55, varying in a ire from the infant child to those of twelve and fourteen v. It has been the ]&gt;olicy heretofore prevailing in the conduct of this institution to find among residents in and nwir this city places for their keeping and boarding, for which tin - state has been paying $3.00 or more per Meek until such time as they can be placed either permanently or in trial homes with the view of being adopted as j&gt;erinanent members of the family where placed. The unanimous judgment of this Imurd is that such a policy is unwise and more expensive than should be the case. While it is true, in a measure only, that these children, during the time they are thus being boarded out, have some of the benefits of home life, it is also equally true according to our experience and observation that there is an element of commercialism in all such transactions, the result of which generally is to give the least of service in the way of care, attention, food and shelter for the muiev paid therefor. In a general way the person thus employed to board one of these children has need of the money, and tlis necessity alone results in the undertaking. These temporary homes thus provided are in many cases poorly suited for the proper care of the children thus placed therein. v\ «• there </seg>
