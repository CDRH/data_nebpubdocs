The marketing of this crop has taught us several lessons, which the most important to my mind is the need of closer co- among operation on the part of growers in handling and marketing their fruit.

The Department of Entomology of the University has v untarily acted in that capacity when necessary Last summer Congress passed a Federal horticultural inspc •r and quarantine law, making necessary a certificate of inspection on all shipments of horticultural goods entering, into Interstate commer naming the legally authorized state inspector as the officer to issue suet certificate.

The most important was in changing from payment by the day for picking, to pay- ment by the bushel. Tickets good lor the required number of bushels were given to each man when the wagon came lor his apples and these could be cashed in at any time. For use in, case a man had finished a tree and moved on betore the wagon came, each man was assigned a number and given cards bearing this number, and when he left his apples he placed one of these cards in a conspicuous place among his filled boxes and we were able to credit him with the correct number of bushels and give him the tickets a hen we came to him. Of course, this "by the bushel" system required a pood man to be on: the watch all the "time to see that the fruit was not handled too roughly or shaken off the trees, and.it was possibly handled with less care- than a good man would have used working by the day; however. when we considered the fact that th&lt;; best a $2 per day man seemed to be able to do was about 25 bushels per day, costing us 8 cents per bushel. you see, and at four cents per bushel he could get from 60 to 110 bushels per day, we felt able to struggle along with this small disadvantage. We paid 4 cents per bushel for all varieties practically all the way through, but towards the last the Winesaps being rather small and nat- urally hard to pick, owing to the shape the trees grow, we began paying five cents per bushel for this variety. Our troes being unusually heavily loaded last year, — the best tree noted ; having slightly over 40 bushels. and practically every tree of winter varieties, except Winesap, running 15 bushels or better, the men were enabled to make very good wages. </seg>

A good cellar is the best place to hold them back, where it is dark. I have kept them in such a place for a period of two weeks, bringing them up a few days before Easter, so as to harden them up before sending them out.

Mr. Green: Just one question or suggestion I would like to make, and that is in regard to the Formosum lily. The average small florist does not grow enough of them. We grow them in the fall, and begin to grow them and cut them steadily up along to Decoration day. They all had the same treatment exactly, but some of them were eighteen inches high, and some of them were seven or eight feet high. Another thing about us Email fellows: I am a small grower comparatively, in a small DISCUSSION. </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY T T x town; now the cold storage Giganteum, there are a number of wholesal - ers who are putting them out in large lots. It is a good idea for a small grower , to have _* hundred or so come along the first of every month, from February, or January and March on up to the first of May. Pot them up. That will give yoiT a] tteadyj mpplyjof j lilies on up through the summer months. It is almost impossible to get the Formosum at this time of the year, they are not on the market. The Chairman: Get the bulbs in the fall Mr. Green: My idea was to buy Giganteum. We are planting 100 bulbs the first of January, and will plant them the first of March. And we will get lilies all the time, Instead of using specimens. Mr.' Frey : We commence getting our cold storage lilies the first of March, and from that time on, we get them. We have been getting our Formosum lilies since Christmas, and will have enough lilies for every day use up to Easter, and then they will straggle on that way. Mr. Frey: I do not believe it would pay a small grower to ha Harrisii except in two or three cases, maybe. There are places when have been, where they were Harrisii and about 60 or 70 per cent of thet were diseased. Once in a while somebody will get a case of them tha will be good. I ' believe that the best lily for the small grower to groi would be the Formosum. There is very little disease in the bulbs, am practically all of them come clean. Out of 100, there will be 50 or 60 pe cent of them that will be anywhere from two to three feet, and they hav good foliage. I remember I bought the first case of Harrisii that ever cam west, about twenty-seven years ago, and out of that 100, there was 10 bulbs, and: I had 101 plants, and every one was perfect, and while the grew about five or six feet high, not every one of them was a P' plant, and they ran from fifteen to sixteen flowers, and today out &lt; same bulbs, you will get about three flowers. Personally, I grow ( teum for Easter, 1 but I give them heat. The bulbs arrive here November, or the last of October, and they are potted immediately I let the pots get well filled with roots and give them heat. I do not 80 degrees at night, in fact all I can give them. And by Easter yo get a flower that is a good deal larger, and has more substance tha that can be grown. Mr. Williams: The small grower can't give them that heat. That the trouble with the Giganteum. I have grown them for the last thr or, four years, and I found that I lacked the heat that was necessary 1 them, and so I could not handle them. I ordered Formosum, and ther are several others that are smaller than I am, and some that are large than I am, and they are in the same fix. So I tackled the Harrisii for mj main crop, and I have 2,000 as pretty, plants as you ever laid your eyes on. They average twenty-four inches high, and have good straight stems, right down to the pot, and I have seen hardly a diseased plant in the buueh. If you can get Harrisii like that, I think they are good, to grow because you can get them into blossom without much forcing, and it save; the florist a lot of worry.'

Mr. Henderson: Mr. President, and fellow members of the State Florists' SocietyT|^The J sub jectjof heating greenhouses : Is [not] anjeasy subject to do justice to in a short article. But to be in the florist business </seg>
            <seg id="p092">92 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY it seems to be a necessity to be able 10 understand steam heating be - cause thereupon depends part of the success of growing Bowers, as there are only three months of the year in which we need no steam heat. My first experience In heating greenhouses extends back some twenty - five or thirty years ago, when the florist business was in its infancy, when most of us were short of money and had to get along as cheap as pos - sible. In those days as you will well remember, we used brick flues extending from one end of the greenhouse to the other, with a fireplace lnj the*, lower end and some kind of a chimney in the other. These flues kept the house fairly warm and everything seemed to thrive as long as these flues did not crack and let the gas into the houses, which they of - ten did. The next improvement we had was putting water pipes with heating coils placed into these fireplaces in addition to the : flues which worked fairly well when put in right. After that came the hot I water boiler, which of course, is a good thing for the growing of store plants and other plants, but to grow roses it is not as good on account of . the sudden changes in our climate, it not being able to heat as quick as steam. We therefore had to install the steam boiler with the gravity syster by digging a deep hole in the ground in order to place the top water lin of the boiler about two feet below the heating pipes to get the condense water to return to the boiler. This has now been improved upon by th use of steam traps which lift the water. into the boilers by their ow: pressure even if the boiler stands on the top of the ground and abov the heating pipes. The size of the boiler ought to be about one hundred horsepower t&lt; every Jtwenty-flye 1 thousand square" feet |of [glass [ or j two] boilers of on' hundred horsepower each to fifty thousand feet of glass. I would us&lt; regular tubular iron boilers with four-inch flues with j the smokestack ii the front. A seventy-five foot stack with thirty-inch diameter, to a hun dred horsepower boiler, or if for two or three boilers the stack must b' in proportion. There is a great saving in fuel if you have a high smoke stack, you get more heat out of your coal from a Beventy-five foot stacl than you get out^of [aTflfty4oot T stack? The grate ought to be a close shaker grate, about half an inch open - ing, although of course it would depend some on the kind of coal yon are using. The main feed pipes out from the boiler ought to be a four - inch to the hundred horsepower, and: the return three-inch. The main feed ought to be extended overhead with an asbestos covering to the upper L end of .the" house or from [the middle to each end; this pipe can be reduced to*a" little smaller, attach' branch* from the four-inch, thus making the steam return' back to the starting point,* the »ixe of the heating pipes.

For some other plants you will not need so many pipes. There are two systems of heating: High and low pressure. On the </seg>

The high tommended as a saving in heating; it heats of heat, and thus when it gets into the as much water, as in the low pressure. it takes, I find on an average, on a range of bouse plant, and down to violet, say fifty thou- onth at a 'cost of [about} $500.00 j&gt;r, three and housand feet of glass, at a cost of $10.00 per 1.00 per hundred, or one cent per foot, per prices on Cherokee steam coal at an average n that can save your firm 50 to 100 per cent on understands bis business.

I </seg>
            <seg id="p094">94 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY would like to state that the heating plant is not given the attention it should have, by the florist. He will go and water his plants when they are dry; he will open up his ventilators, and he is always trying some new plants or flowers, and thinking that by that he is attending to his business, and keeping up-to-date. When fall comes he begins to think about the firing, and that as a general rule is the last minute, and he finds there are two or three things to be done, and the first thing you know the cold weather is here, and he goes around and tries to get the cheap - est man he can get to throw his coal in this winter. Nine florists out of ten do that. There are a few of the progressive ones do not do that. I am one of the guilty ones and I have done it to my sorrow. I believe that a cheap man is expensive at any price for a night fireman. There are several propositions that Mr. Henderson did not enter into upon his paper, that I would like to have threshed out but as I say, the time is short, and I will let it go. But as I say, there is not a florist that gives the attention that he should to his heating plant, and there is no one that burns as much coal as the florist does. Q. What sort of a compound do you use for your boiler A. I have been using the liquid compound, and I think it is bettc than a dry compound. Q. Do you remember the ingredients in that compound A. I do not, it is manufactured in Omaha Q. How often do you use it? fA. I put it in once a week, and I put in about half a gallon at a tii the boiler, and it does the work, and makes a whole lot of differei the fire or firing of the boiler, of course you must wash it out. T way you draw the water out of the boiler is some every week, — empty t boiler thoroughly once a month, and draw out a lit while that settles to the bottom. Q. In case of a hot water system, is this compound good to u A. I do not know; I do not know anything about a hot water ey Mr. Williams: A boiler compound is good for any boiler Q. Where do you drain your boiler, above or below the be room? A. I generally have the boiler connected with the sewer and returr. pipes come right from the back end of the boilers and flow into the sewer at the lowest point of the sewer. You must have your opening on the bottom of the boiler, so that you can get that scale off. Q. Well, we haven't a sewerage connection. A. You don't need a sewerage. You can blow it wherever you want to. It is not necessary to blow it all off, just blow it until the water gets clear and we blow ours out into the yard. Let it blow until the water has gone down about two inches and you will get about all of the settlings out of your boiler.

DIS( I ION S The Chairman: This paper is now open for discussion. If ai has any questions they would like to ask, Mr..

But it has had a gradua think of its handling $100,000 worth of fruit last year growth from the early beginning.

It occurs to me that some astociatioi kind should be formed here, embracing the southeastern part of Nebrask and southwestern Iowa. Council Bluffs does well enough for it to hai its association, and it may well have a dozen other associations, but need larger communities so that they can work together in harmon and know where best to place their surplus fruits.

Now I think we should have a Missouri Valley Apple Growers' Association, which would include both sides of the river. This should be organized, and a campaign of advertising should be started, and the amount to each grower would be very small.

A Member: For the last three weeks I have been in the east and ;he people back there did not seem to think or realize that we could grow apples at all out here, and they would say "Apples in Nebraska, they can not be as good as in Michigan or New, York." That would be wherever I happened to be. And I naturally told them we could beat them even if it was three to one when they were talking to me. And, of course, I told them that we did not grow as many varieties as they did, but we grew encourage the grower, and the exp&lt; I really believe that as large as tt here would be an advantage to a s will come to.

Now plating advertising in Omaha, advertise your home apples and sell home apples. Mr. Pollard: I have been very much interested in this relating to the formation of a fruit growers' association. I see here quit a number of gentlemen who were at Auburn two or three week ago. perhaps may bore some who w'ere here yesterday, when I made the re marks that I did. But I feel that I should say a word now when this question is open for discussion. I want to say that as a result of the Auburn meeting, and as it happened I was the temporary chairman, and was called upon to appoint a committee of fifteen to draft a constitution and by-laws for the government of s'ich an association that that commit wore and 7 think we need this association to advertise our apples, and fc [es fc the business of locating our markets. Mr. Hess: I think the gentleman from Omaha is correct in adv&lt; eating the central association, but you need the small associations t join in and form these large -associations. The large associations hav to be formed by the smaller ones. There are so many things that ca be done in the small association that are helpful to the grower that pe: haps the large association could not take care of. Now, for instano the purchasing and handling of the material, the boxes and barrels, an the spraying material, and all these things would be handled through you local association, which is a big advantage, because you can buy at whol' sale rates if you want to. And it is a tremendous help to a small growe Now, a man with a small orchard at a small place, unless he has a association, he is at thp mercy of somebody else, but it he is in an ass- ciation he shares equally with the rest of the members, because th expenses are paid, and if there is any money ieft he gets a pro rata div dend for the amount of fruit he sold.

This is partly a consequence of the relatively ■e of many of the farm products. Just as there is a amount of waste in distribution of farm and manufactured e is a very great difference in this respect among farm selves. For the relatively permanent products of the farm, )t be disposed of at a given time or may even be held a . are far less than for the more perishable products, unecessarv wastes in distribution for wheat and corn atively very much less than for the more perishable e included vegetables and fruits.

He 'had heard, without questioning the authenticity &lt; formation, that apples would render more acid an already acid Any way they did not agree with him. And so it happened that to a discussion of the hygiene of apples.

Moreover, high! percentage [of [flberj contents-cellulose, the chemist migh The | gastricjjuices Jof Jthe 1 stomach \ can I not digest raw stare saliva is thoroughly incorporated with it in the process of ma and the very best gastric juice has hard work digesting cellul Itu the process of ripening on the tree is a process in which the amount of cellulose is reduced or converted into plain water and the starch com verted into sugar.

A ripening apple] la [a] living 1 thing,! drawlngjnburishment not only from its parent tree?; but from | sunshine; and fatmosphericTeleuieuLs.^j Our first conclusion then .is this: The weak stomached person should eat only those apples which have reached the flower of maturity </seg>
            <seg id="p267">UK HYGIENE OF APPLKS 267 r&lt; a I perfectly, matured apple has some starch and Dse.in it, and so our second conclusion is that: when' the weak ohed man eats apples he should masticate and masticate until the nverted into saliva. It will then be admitted that a aten will not give any one indigestion. Thank heaven ave stomachs which never rebel at any kind of an apple. a case is illustrated by a high colored Northern Spy which matured unny side of an open branched tree, standing on a hill top. It and grew in a full flood of sunshine and air current. Then con - i green livered, under-colored specimen that grew in the shade on under branches. Its parent tree may have stood tucked away 1 where it got little sunshine and no air movement. Moreover, grower took no chances with frost and wind and picked it in &gt;ne Juth. It is ! suggestive [ of quinine. We don't have to recall what avor and bouquet of the high colored, ripened apple suggests. We mber that. Having disposed of the matter of indigestion, we come to the matter le acid. That is easy. We have only to produce the medical authority ! statement that the gastric juices of the stomach convert the citric ialic acids, found in all apples, . into the salts of potassium, and otassium salts are a corrective of uric acid. That statement, when ppreciated, should banish all fear that uric acid may be produced ng apples. We are fast coming to an understanding of these n modern days. For instance, the matter of diet is a matter of ■ath in case of typhoid. But it is good medical practice now - give the patient baked apple or scraped raw apple. The ve no power of selection in , the matter of their diet, but the New York, as well as other states, lays in a season's supply of &gt;r the patients in its asylum hospitals, considering the fruit Just necessity of diet as eggs, butter,' or flour. ; creatures of habit, and there are few of: us who can not &gt;urselves to whatever, is proper and good for us. If one has been accustomed to eating apples it might be well to commence with a time. Better still commence with a right baked apple, he right variety rightly baked. The York Imperial is a ight variety and it bakes right. It has the right degree of acidity. It loesn't collapse and ran all over the cooking utensil and come out of neither baked apple nor apple sauce. Snip out the calix. Take the core from the stem side without cutting clean through, and fill hole with sugar. Don't peel off the jacket. Bake in a fairly hot •ven. The York Imperial then comes from the oven done through yet •etaining its natural shape, unshapely though that be. You know it is i baked apple by the golden, juicy cracks, where the flesh comes bursting •ut. The skin is almost as tender as the flesh. It is safe to recommend he York because it comes from the Southland where there is always enough sunshine to ripen the fruit on the tree. In the time of Charles jmb they did not have such baked apples. Otherwise subsequent gen - erations might have enjoyed an essay on roast apple instead of roast pig. </seg>
