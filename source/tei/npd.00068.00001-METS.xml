            <seg id="p007">MESSAGE OF ARTHUR J. WEAVER, GOVERNOR . DELIVERED TO THE FORTY-SEVENTH SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA . . January 8, 1931 SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES: I am happy to greet and -welcome you on this occasion. I express the hope that during the session you will enjoy good health and through your deliberations and actions contribute to the welfare and progress of our state. I feel sure you will, co-operate with the new Governor and his administration for everything that is good for Nebraska. The constitution requires that the Governor at the commencement of each session and at the close of his term of office, give, by message to the Legislature, information of the' condition of the state and shall recommend such measures as he shall deem expedient. Inasmuchas my term of office expires and my successor, by the .vote of the people, be - comes Governor today, I do not regard it either appropriate or expedient to make extended observations or recommendations as to future policies. Those which I do submit will be brief and based largely on my experience as Governor. I do deem it my duty to refer to some of the major problems which confronted my administration, record, the action taken, and report the condition of the state and its government. A LEGACY OF UNSETTLED CONDITIONS AND UNSETTLED PROBLEMS When I became Governor on January 3, 1929, my administration faced both an economic and political situation which was unparalleled m the history of our. state. Since the deflation after the World War agriculture has been languishing, farming has been unprofitable and farmers generally have been discouraged and depressed. The situation was especially aggravated by a distressing and acute bank problem. The solution of the bank, the intangible tax, paving the farm-to - market road, the Code law and Fish, Game and public recreational prob - lems, legacies of former administrations and footballs m Nebraska politics for many years, was long past due. THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS In my inaugural message I discussed these at length and made recommendations for their solution. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Regardless of any criticism which may be offered it cannot be truth - fully said that this administration of the last Legislature shirked the responsibility of courageously endeavoring to solve these problems for Nebraska. Criticism which amounts to dissent without reason or offers no constructive substitute for action taken, is gratuitous, and indefen - sible. It is with satisfaction that I recite the fact that the members of the Legislature by a preponderant vote regardless of political affilia - tions, approved my recommendations for the solution of these prob - lems as! follows: Votes on Bank Measures HOUSE ROLL 249 — General Banking Provisions (Repeal Guarantee Fund Commission Act — Providing Reorganization of Failed Banks) House Vote: . , . • For Rep. 63; Dem. 20 — Total For... 83 Against -Rep. 0; Dem. 3 — Total Against . 3 Senate Vote: • • .

Political lines could easily have been drawn on this important ques - tion, but be it. said to the great credit and honor of the members of both parties m the Legislature, they were earnestly attempting to solve the problem, to protect the depositors of failed banks as far as possi - ble, to save the State Bank system and protect the investments and business of the state as a whole. The votes of the members at both the regular and special sessions fully justify this statement. Both 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p010">political parties, I have no reason to doubt, m all sincerity pledged the people of the state m 1928 to oppose repeal, or weakening of the Bank Guarantee Law. As a candidate for Governor I approved such a platform. In my inaugural message I presented the necessity of this course to the Legislature. Republicans and Democrats alike, as well as the people generally, adhered to this position. They did so m good faith without full knowledge of the facts as disclosed later, that the Bank Guarantee law was dead and was a liability to all banks and the public interest. BANK INVESTIGATION REPORT The Bank investigation report of Former Governor Shallenberger, which I submit to the Legislature' m printed form and which has my approval, discloses the reasons for the banking catastrophe which came to a crises m my administration. I approve the able- and splendid service which Governor Shallenberger has rendered and ask your care - ful perusal of his report. ■ • , The investigation, coupled with the work of the Banking Depart - ment under the new laws, has been the means of strengthening our banking laws, of convicting many law violators and of securing the return of several hundred thousands of dollars for the depositors. The Department advises me that it received a check today for ■ $18,000 m settlement of directors and stockholders liability. It discloses also that our administration of banking m the past has been seriously deficient and that the banking debacle came upon us because of our failure to act years ago when the Guaranty Fund became bankrupt. The banking problem of . Nebraska, which has been settled by' the conditional repeal of the "Guaranty" and new laws, represents a legacy of former yeai's. While I had no part m creating this situation, I have exerted my best energies and best ability for its solution. I re - gard as an outstanding accomplishment of this administration the new bank legislation and departmental administration of banks which now obtains. If nothing else had been accomplished for Nebraska during the two years I have labored m the gruelling office of Governor, it has been worth while as a contribution to my State. As evidence of the bankrupt condition of the Bank Guaranty Fund, as long ago as January- 1, 1925, when Governor McMullen be - came Governor, I incorporate m this message a statement prepared and certified to by Ivan W. Hedge, Auditor of the Receivership Division of the Banking Department as follows: ' . 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p011">5 Receivers Certificate outstanding January 1, 1925 $2,332,276.93 Unpaid Deposits: In 12 going banks operated by the Com - mission $4,654,533.69 . In 3i Receivership banks 1,124,082.40 Total unpaid deposits 5,778,616.09 Total liabilities unpaid January 1, 1925 $8,110,893.02 The cash on hand m banks for the benefit of the Guarantee Fund on January 1, 1925, wa,s $2,769,107.43. The record discloses that the $8,110,893.02 unpaid January 1, 1925, has been reduced by the collection of assets in| these failed banks to a balance of $5,112,849.49, which is the actual loss to the Guarantee Fund or depositors. COURT DECISION DELAYS BANK GUARANTY LEGISLATION AT REGULAR SESSION The regular session, had it not been for the injunction issued by the District Court, would m my opinion have passed a new Bank Guar - anty law. By practically unanimous opinion of the members of the Legislature who had intensively studied the question for four months, there would undoubtedly have been a limited Guarantee only, for the future. The assessments provided by the old law would have been re - duced and divided between the past and the future. This was on the .sound contention that depositors of existing banks were entitled to as much consideration and protection as depositors m failed banks, and that the depositors m failed banks were entitled to an equitable settle - ment also. Any future Guarantee, because a deficit of twenty-two mil - lion had been created, would have abandoned the discredited principle of an unlimited liability with a limited assessment. It would have been indefensible for the Legislature, after our disastrous experience, to have enacted new legislation which would not have prevented future deficits. The new foundation therefore, would neccssai-ily have rested onaone or two year accounting period. Under such a system there would have been a determination and likewise liquidation of the losses occurring for that period only, based entirely on what was collected. This plan was sound and similar to our state hail insurance program. The injunction of the District Court, however, deferred legislation until the final ruling of the Nebraska Supreme Court on February 6, 1930. The Court held that as long as banks remained m the state system they were estopped from, securing m the Courts relief from any assess - ments fixed by the Legislature. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">6 The people should know that at the time this decision was rendered f the 635 then existing State Banks, and which banks had not been re- I sponsible for any part of the deficit, had paid assessments for the benefit 1 of depositors other than their own of $11,982,720.38. There were also \ uncollected assessments of $2,912,326.95 levied during my administration for the full years of 1929 and 1930 at the rate of 6/10 of one per cent annually and held m abeyance by litigation now pending m the United States Supreme Court. This made a total for the then existing banks of $14,895,047.33 out of a total of $19,926,530.79, assessed against all State Banks since 1911. The difference was paid by failed, liquidated and nationalized banks while they held state charters. The inevitable result of the Supreme Court decision, arid the ruling of the Attorney General m 1929 that State Banks which had paid their assessments to date could liquidate or nationalize without further lia - bility for assessments, and the growing lack of confidence m the State Bank system because of the huge deficit (many people not understand - ing that the State Banks were not liable for more than their assessment) was that a number of State Banks had nationalized (19 since the Su- » preme Court decision). Others merged with National Banks, or liqui- I dated. The situation was becoming so chaotic that the existence of the State Bank system, the rights of the depositors m failed banks, as well as the business structure of the entire state, were jeopardized. Had I failed to act when the state was confronted with this emer - gency I would have been as unworthy of my office as a General m a battle who needlessly sacrificed the lives of his soldiers to carry out the orders based on a different situation than the one which confronted ham. When a crisis impends, political considerations or even party pledges made without full knowledge of the facts, should be disregarded m the public interest THE SPECIAL SESSION A grave and intolerable bank situation confronting the state de - manded constructive and remedial legislation. I therefore immediately presented the full facts to the members of the Legislature and to the people of the state by the issuance of a statement on the bank situation. This statement was an analysis of unchallenged facts. It was trans - mitted to the members of the Legislature and given to the press almost a month before the special session was convened at my call. These members of the Legislature were unusually qualified to deal with this question because . of long and intensive consideration at the regular session. They had ample time to analyze the- facts presented and the plan proposed. . </seg>
            <seg id="p013">7 I refer to my message to the special session — March 4th, 1930 (Special Senate .and House Journal, Page 21). .;■■■ TWO PLANS SUBMITTED . The special session m its consideration of the bank problem was confronted with two major proposals. One proposal was for flat repeal, with thought only of the distress and casualties which had come to the State Banks. It did not recognize that thousands of innocent depositors had suffered through the effects of a state Jaw of noble conception and purpose, but which without proper administrative provisions, without provisions for limitation of bank charters or for licensing of bank offi - cials, and without adequate supervision for an increasing number of banks, had become an instrument of destruction alike to the banks, the depositors and the public. The other proposal was also for a repeal, but it provided for equitable relief to the depositors and additional protective bank laws for the future. The representatives of the people, as a result of their deliberations, adopted as to its. general provisions this latter proposal as the best and most practical solution. It is my . deliberate judgment that without the special session of the Legislature, Nebraska would not have at this time a state banking system worthy of the name. At the time I called the special session, a large number of state banks had made application to nationalize, and since the special session only six nationalized. RELIEF FOR DEPOSITORS— ALSO SAVES STATE BANK SYSTEM The new law, with increasing bank deposits from improved con - ditions, should eventually bring to the depositors approximately four million dollars or its equivalent under the optional payment plan, from the annual assessments of two-tenths of per cent beginning January 1, 1931. With the assessments under the old law then m force, made m April and July, 1929, and m January, 1930 (if these are not set aside: by the United States Supreme Court), a total of approximately seven, million dollars should go into the final depositors' settlement fund from the banks. Under the stop-up plan of the new law those de - positors who have received the least will be paid first, the first pay - ment of eight per cent having already been made. Many depositors •who have suffered through mismanagement of banks, and from out - rageous preferences through operation of insolvent banks as going concerns under the Guarantee Fund Commission law (there being five million of preferences m seventy-three of these banks alone) are en - titled, as provided by the new law, to receive this consideration m order that payments to all depositors, as far as possible, may be pqualized. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">8 Depositors of Failed Banks Now Receiving 60% to 70% from Bank Assets Alone In practically all cases the earlier failures were the" most dis - astrous, depleted the Guarantee Fund and brought it to a condition of hopeless insolvency. The Bank Commissioner and the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Commerce estimate that the depositors of banks closed since January 1, 1929, will receive an average of 60% to 70% of their claims from the bank assets alone. Depositors m six banks have received 100%. ■• . ■ . • .■ •\ ' ■ ■ . . ■ ' ■ ■■ • Payments to Depositors The liquidation department is operating 1 efficiently and as expedi - tiously as possible. Total payments to the depositors of failed banks ' for the last two years, from all sources, is $7,496,409.85. In addition there is on hand m all receiverships ; January Ist, this year $1,180,607.55 m cash, making a total of $8,677,017.40 distributed or available for distribution. Local Depositors Committees One of tne added safeguards m the sale of the failed bank assets is the rule that I put into effect when the • Guaranty Fund Commission was abolished, that no sale of any assets should be' made- without the approval of a local committee selected at a depositors' meeting. This action alone I am sure has saved the depositors thousands of- dollars, and m any event it is sound and just that the depositors through their committee have a right to pass on the sale of their own property. ' ■ New Bank Reorganization Law — Forty-three Failed Banks Reorganized m Twenty Months Another means of protecting- the interests of depositors and the business of a community where a. bank has failed, .is the -reorganiza - tion law, whereby 85% of the deposits can reorganize a failed bank. New bank capital is required. All undesirable paper is taken out of the bank and the deposits are shrunk pro-rata for the amount of the assets eliminated. The bank continues to serve the community with - out serious injury to community business or the greater ; loss to de - positors which come from long 1 , drawn-out liquidation. The assets . eliminated, however, remain the property of the depositors, the collec - tion of which is m their hands. Forty-three banks reorganized under ' this plan since the passage of this act m April, 1929, are now function - ing successfully. . .. • -.-'. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">9 The Future of the State System Now Assured In addition to the abolition of the Guarantee Fund Commission, the consolidation of the bank liquidation department under the Secretary cf the Department of Trade and Commerce, the conditional repeal of the Bank Guarantee Law, the creation of the depositors' final settle - ment fund, provision for payment of assessments of 2/10 of one per cent of the average daily deposits for a period of ten years by the banks into said fund, m addition to payments m said fund of collections accruing from the old Guarantee Fund assets, and from any appro - priations by the Legislature, the state at the regular and special ses - sions passed some of the most outstanding and protective bank regula - tions to be found m. the United States. Among these are the following: I—-Creation1 — -Creation of the Office of .Bank Commissioner with term of six years, and who must be technically trained, an experienced banker chosen solely on the basis of his technical knowledge, experience and ability. He has sole authority m bank supervision and examinations, and. authority m the appointment of examiners. He is removable only by . the Governor for cause. These mandatory provisions as to this office and its administration and the long tenure of office provided, • free the banking department from political interference or control. The result is that Nebraska now has a strong banking Department, . headed by an able Bank Commissioner and a full force of examiners. All are well paid and the salaries and expenses of the Commissioner and 'examiners are paid by the banks examined under the assessments au - thorized by the new law. 2 — Examination of Trust Companies, Etc., Now Paid by Companies Examined • Trust Companies, Building and Loan Associations, Installment In - vestment Companies and other organizations of similar character, re - main under the Department of Trade and Commerce, but a separate examination force has been provided, the cost of salaries and expenses of which are paid by the Companies examined, under assessments pro - vided by law. 3 Priority Depositors' Lien, Except Taxes and Exchange Items The claims of depositors, for deposits, not otherwise secured, and claims of holders of exchange shall have priority over all other claims, except federal, state, county and municipal taxes, and subject to such taxes shall at the time of the closing of a bank be a first lien on all the assets of the banking corporation. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">4 — Exchange Items ... Provision has been made to expedite and simplify the collection and payment by banks of checks and other instruments for *he payment of money. '&#132;*.-.'.. ' ' " .- . i i '. . s—Surplus5 — Surplus . • State Banks must now set aside twenty per cent of their earnings each year to a surplus fund until the amount of the special surplus fund equals one-half of the capital, and until the combined capital and surplus equal ten per cent of the deposits. C — Bank Slander Law • . ■■ . ;••'• . ■■_. Banks and depositors are given the protection of a bank slander provision which makes it a felony, . subject to a thousand dollar fine or two years' imprisonment m the penitentiary for anyone making a ma licious or slanderous statement against a bank. 7 — Excess Loans State Banks are now forbidden under penalty to make excess loans. A State Bank is permitted to loan to any individual-, firm or corpora - tion twenty per cent of its capital and surplus. If it loans more than this amount it becomes an excess loan. B—Licensing8 — Licensing of Bankers Bankers are now licensed and if they disobey the' laws • governing their institutions through mismanagement or gross neglect their license is revoked and they are prohibited from becoming connected with a State Bank. . • 9 — Banking Department Now Has Discretion m Issuance of Bank Char - ters . ♦ New bank charters are now granted only on the ground of public necessity. Since January Ist, 1929, two bank charters only have been issued. , • - Had the original Bank Guarantee law provided a liability no greater than the .income from limited assessments with settlements at stated periods, had it granted discretion to the Banking Department m the issuance of charters (and then only on a finding of public necessity) had it provided licensing of bankers, the Guarantee law might have been alive and m full vigor today. It was the issuance ' of approxi - mately four hundred unnecessary and unwarranted bank charters that 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p017">helped destroy not only many of these "mushroom" banks, but many others which would have survived m a fair and legitimate banking field. ' The result has been not only an economic loss of millions to the state, but tragedies m banking houses, business houses and the homes of the people. The record of the Bank Guarantee and Guaranty Fund Commission comprises the saddest chapter m the * history of Nebraska. If the courts uphold the new legislation considerable relief will come under the just provision of the step-up plan where those who have been paid the least shall be paid first. . The new bank law. should not be repealed as it represents equitable relief to thousands of citizens who have helped build the state, and who have suffered great wrong, especially through the unjust prefer - ences m the operation of the Guaranty Fund Commission Law. On the other hand, a small annual assessment on the bunks for a limited period of ten years is no more than it would cost if they were m the Federal Reserve system. Consequently, they are under no competitive handicap with the national banks. The Bank Guaranty has failed m every state where tried and no equitable provision for reimbursement has been provided. Nebraska is the only state, so far as I can ascertain, that has passed a repeal law - conditioned on equitable consideration for depositors. I regard the banking legislation as outlined m H. R. 249, Senate File 3, as well as other corrective acts, passed by the last Legislature, as highly constructive and beneficial to the state. The solution of this problem m the interest of Nebraska and. her people could be no longer deferred. The new banking laws are the result of intense study, earnest con - sideration and the courage of the members of the last Legislature. Beyond question they are the best banking laws that this state has ever had and as sufficient as the provisions of any state. They should not ■ be materially altered at this time. ". . ■ The New Intangible Tax Law Two years ago I recommended to the Legislature that inasmuch as the intangible tax law then m force was a failure as a revenue pro - ducer, and fixed a rate which had no particular relation to that on any sizeable amount of taxable property m the state; it should be amended by providing a basis of taxation comparable to the average farm rate. This was substantially accomplished by the passage of House Roll 421. Monies are now taxed and I think justly, at- the low rate of two and one-half mills. This was on the theory that monies constitute the life 11 </seg>
            <seg id="p018">blood of the commercial transactions of the community, and are m fact a reserve and should flow freely among the people m their business transactions and for building the communities and the state. Intangible investments are taxed at the average farm rate of eight mills on actual value. • The average farm rate m Nebraska is approximately twelve mills, the United States court, m the railroad tax cases held that taxable prop - erty is not assessed at over 75% of its value. Therefore eight mills is an approximate equivalent of the average farm rate m Nebraska. The new law requires a separate return to the county assessor, under oath, from the taxpayer. The separate return requirement is just be - cause farm lands and other forms of tangible property can be viewed and listed. .'.■■': • ' ■ .'•".■ '"■'■'• I The results for this biennium, even with a general shrinkage of values and especially of stocks and bonds, have justified the new legisla - tion. In 1929 there was $150,000,000 more intangibles returned than were returned m 1928. This brought almost one million dollars of new reve - nue distributed on the basis of 1/6 to the state and 5/6 to the county, city, village and school districts. In 1930 with a further shrinkage of values, evidenced by a reduction of assessed values of more than sixty-five millions m real estate and personal property there was $75,000,000 more returned than m 1928. The revenue to the state and its sub-divisions from intangibles for 1930 will amount to approximately $1,365,000. I consider the present intangible tax law to be not only the best and fairest, but the only sound and intangible tax law ever placed on the statute books of this state. It should be given a fair trial. I said m my inaugural message that the alternative of the intangible tax was an income tax. : . • Passed at the closing days of. the 1929 regular session an insufficient sum was provided for its administration. I have therefore recommended m the budget for the coming biennium, an additional $5,000 as a con - tingent fund for enforcement. ROADS The people of Nebraska are agreed as to the necessity of good roads; that we should build them as fast as we can afford them and that they should be of varying type and character to meet the demands of the traffic which they carry. This would provide pavement where pavement is indispensable. It would provide gravel where gravel roads 12 </seg>
            <seg id="p019">answer the purpose. It would provide dirt roads where they are eco - nomical. It has been our policy for the above purposes, to make equit - able distribution of road funds and road building to all parts of the state as provided by law. It is unnecessary for me to detail the program that Nebraska has made m its highway program since the passage of the gasoline tax m 1926. ■ • Our people know that under the able, economical administration of Roy Cochran, the Secretary of the Department of Public Works, we have built splendid gravel roads into all parts of the state and now have 4,760 miles of gravel roads which the state is maintaining, thus relieving the counties of the expense of both construction and maintenance of this large mileage. Our' people know also that county roads are necessary feeders for the statq and federal highways. They know too, that the time has come when m the interest of economy and because of our needs we must now pave the main arteries where gravel is no longer economical. Therefore at the last session of the Legislature, their representa - tives passed necessary and constructive road legislation. For the first time m the history of the state there was provided the basis of a sound farm-to-market road .system by allotting one cent of the gasoline tax to the counties. This with the seventy per cent of the automobile license fees which the counties receive gives the counties more than five million dollars annually for county roads. For the first time m the history of the state also the last regular session laid the basis for a paving program and during this adminis - tration 196 miles of pavement, two feet wider than that of the adjoining states, have been constructed. It was the intention of the Legislature m the passage of the four cent gasoline tax to meet Federal aid for this biennium. The state .funds provided would have, been sufficient had it not been for the increase of fifty million dollars of federal aid annually by Act of Congress. We were therefore confronted with the necessity of meeting the available federal aid by providing additional state r-evenue. In view, however, of the emergency appropriation passed last month by the United States Congress, for the purpose of relieving unemployment and to be ex - pended by September 1, 1931, and which Secretary Cochran ( thinks will amount to two million for Nebraska, because all states will not be able to .meet all federal aid, there is and will be available at this time for Nebraska, an additional $2,000,000. • From information given me by the Highway Department we are now m a position to meet all federal aid out of our state funds, and also make 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p020">the normal annual expenditure out m the state for construction and graveling. This is possible because of the following facts: : The emergency federal allotment can be used to meet Federal aid (one-fifth each year of this emergency federal fund, however, will be deducted from future federal allotments until paid). Therefore there is available to be put under agreement now $4,000,000 (Federal funds not to be matched with state funds — $2,644,000 of this cannot, however, be expended until July 1, 1931). Also $2,644,000 additional federal aid will be available for expenditure July 1, 1932, and can be placed under agreement after January 1, 1932. From this latter amount the first deduction of one-fifth of the federal emergency appropriation above re - ferred to must be made, leaving as the federal allotment for 1932 ■ . $2,244,000 This makes available a total Federal aid to July 1, 1933, of 6,244.000 Deducting the federal aid which will be met with the emergency federal aid funds 0f . . .- ; 2,000,000 there will remain federal aid available 0f .:.... 4,244,000 to be met with state funds during the biennium. ' ■ '•■'.■ ■ ' . . I ; ■• ' Our state funds for the biennium will be as follows: !•■ • Total collections which the state gets from its 3c share of the 4c gasoline tax for the biennium will be $13,000,000 Motor vehicle collections for the biennium. 2,000,000 Making a total of state revenue for the biennium of $15,000,000 NO ADDITIONAL REVENUE NECESSARY TO MEET FEDERAL AID FOR THE NEXT BIENNIUM Deducting the state maintenance for the biennium of -.$6,500,000 Leaves a "balance of 8,500,000 for meeting federal aid and for state construction to July 1, v£2&gt; 1933. U Of the $4,244,000 available federal aid funds to.be met with state funds up to July 1, 1933, it anticipated that. .... 2,000,000 will be met with the. proceeds of "1/6 of the state's share of the gasoline tax for pavement m conformity with the act of the last Legislature. This leaves approximately 2,244,000 of Federal funds to be used m conjunction with approximately $6,500,000 state funds still available from the gasoline tax. 14 </seg>
            <seg id="p021">In other words there will be $4,256,000 more than is needed to meet federal aid to July 1, 1933. This should go for the completion of the state highway system, and is about the amount we are expending nor - mally for this purpose. The pavement funds therefore for the next two years would consist of the four million dollars available now from the emergency appropria - tion and federal aid to meet it, and four million dollars additional con - sisting of two million dollars state funds from the one-half cent gasoline tax for paving and two million of federal aid to meet it. At the cost of approximately $28,000 a mile for the slab, bridge structures, grading, etc., there will be eight million dollars for paving m the next two years, which would enable us to build approximately 325 miles of additional pavement during the coming biennium or 225 miles m 1931 and approximately 100 miles m 1932. NEBRASKA MUST CONTINUE PAVING COMMENSURATE WITH OUR NEEDS Regardless of the fact that we can meet Federal aid for the next two years, we must, not only look ahead, but also take stock of our present situation.- Because we have 363 miles of graveled roads which cost an annual maintenance per mile of about $1,400.00, and 387 miles which are costing an annual maintenance per mile of about $850.00, we should take steps at this session for paving at the earliest possible date of all gravel roads as fast as they become uneconomical. The Legislature should not temporize with this situation. Regard - less of the extra Federal aid which will soon be absorbed, our program should be complete and definite. The needs of Nebraska require a constructive yet definite paving program on the basis of at least 300 miles annually for the next three years, and after that as our needs require. ■ . One means of providing additional funds for pavement is the taxa - tion.of common-carrier trucks and busses, based on tonnage or mileage, or other basis which will constitute a just charge for the use of the roadbed furnished by the state to commercialized business. The tax m whatever form should not be excessive or confiscatory. Common - . carrier trucks and busses should not be driven from our highways by any state policy. The other most practical source of revenue m my judgment is the one under which we are building our highway system, the gasoline tax. I recommend an increase m the gasoline tax sufficient to carry out the above program. . It is an equitable tax. Only those who use the roads should pay the tax and m the final analysis a greater saving than the amount of the tax is effected through increased mileage and a saving m both depreciation and time. 15 </seg>
            <seg id="p022">In case the gasoline tax is increased proper exemptions should be given, as they should have been, provided m the past, on all gasoline used m both agriculture and industry where there is wholly absent the element of transport on the highways. THE CODE LAW • In my inaugural message to the Legislature I recommended as a matter of sound business and m the interest of economy, that the general provisions of the Code law should be repealed. I urge that Code administration should be simplified by eliminations and consolida - tions. Much has been accomplished m the last two years. Much more could have, been accomplished if the Legislature .had adopted my recom - mendation that the Governor be given the' right to transfer any Code agencies or Code Departments to elective State officers. This should be done at this time. As to what can be accomplished m economy along this line, I cite the abolition of the Gasoline Tax Collection Bureau and commitment of the collection of this tax to the State Treasurer. Unless we wish to repeal laws setting up necessary agencies, we cannot eliminate the activities functioning under the Code. These ad - ministrative departments, reduced from six to four, are functioning efficiently and with real economy. We do not accomplish anything by changing the name of a Department, and still retaining the same activities under the Governor. My whole theory of simplification of government as it relates to the Code has been the elimination of any useless agencies, consolidation of others, and the transfer of any agency which can be as well administered by. a Constitutional . officer. If the Governor is given the right of -transfer to Constitutional officers, he will have discretion m what office any activities could best function. This, it seems to me, would be preferable to any definite assignment by law. As an example, I refer to the necessity of the two major Code Departments, the Department of Trade and Commerce, which administers banking arid insurance, and the Department of Public Works, which administers a . great road-building program, having ex - pert appointive heads for such administration. I feel sure that there would be little debate as to this, and m my criticism of the Code I have always excepted these Departments. Neither of these Departments nor the other four (consolidated into two departments during my administration) have ever represented added functions of government. Whether any of these agencies func - tion under the Governor or other Constitutional officers, the principle of the Code obtains. This principle is based on the fixed responsibility m the state official charged with certain administrative duties. This 16 </seg>
            <seg id="p023">principle is sound and has no relation whatever to the other sound principle that if we have too much government m any branch of ad - ministration, we should dispense with it as a matter of common-sense and good business. It is a source of satisfaction to me that after ten years of debate on this question during the service of four Governors and covering the period of twelve years, it remained for this administration to make important eliminations and consolidations with resulting economies. And yet without impairing efficiency. As a result I advise the Legislature at this time that there are only seventy-six people employed m the Code Departments who are receiving pay from property taxes. Whether the activities they ad - minister function here or elsewhere, I feel sure that unless the actrvi - ties authorized by law were materially decreased there could be no material reduction m the administrative force. There is no horde of employees either m these departments or any place m the state gov - ernment. Those who serve the state are doing it efficiently, giving full time and earning every dollar the state pays them. For the information of the Legislature and the electorate, I wish to report also that including the 76 Code employees referred to, there are only 348 persons who are paid from property taxes, outside of those employed by separate Constitutional Boards (University Regents, Nor - mal Board, Board of Control). These are serving m the following Departments, most of which do not function under the Governor. Supreme and District Courts 104 Governor's Office 4 Law Enforcement 9 Secretary of State 7 Auditor . 11 Treasurer 6 Attorney General 10 Superintendent Public Instruction 21 Land Commissioner (including 30 janitors) 36 Code Departments ........... .'. 76 Sundry Departments (including Railway Commis - sion, Tax Commissioner, Military Depart - ment, etc 64 Total 348 There are only 7 persons m the Highway Department paid by prop - erty taxes, these being the Secretary and six persons m the Irrigation Department. All highway patrolmen, all engineers, construction and maintenance forces are paid from gasoline tax. 17 </seg>
            <seg id="p024">CODE ELIMINATIONS AND CONSOLIDATIONS As to what has been accomplished during this administration toward simplifying government and effecting economies without impairing effi - cency, I respectfully refer to. the following: 1. CONSOLIDATIONS UNDER THE TAX COMMISSIONER. A. The Department of Finance and the office of Secretary of Fi - nance have been abolished. B. Checking of Accounts of all Departments under the Governor, Budget Control, Purchasing Department and Material Yard have been consolidated under the Tax Commissioner. C. Consolidation of these four agencies has resulted m the reduc - tion of six employees with a saving for 1929 and 1930 of approximately $29,000 and the release of two office rooms and maintenance thereof. With the addition of a special tax investigator after the passage of the new intangible tax law the number of employees eliminated was five and the saving for 1929 and 1930 was approximately $21,800. This re - duced force handled the work of the consolidated office expeditiously and efficiently including a ten per cent increase m vouchers over the year before made necessary by the enlarged road program as provided by the ■ Legislature for additional grading, graveling, paving and maintenance of roads. Material Yard D. The Tax Commissioner also, as directed by the Governor, after an inventory had been taken of the Material Yard (the first since 1925) and m conformity also with the policy outlined m the Governor's special message to the Legislature and joint approval thereof by both Houses, proceeded to collect many old accounts against counties, contractors and others, the amounts of many of which were undetermined until recently. This has resulted m the collection of $459,803.55. The General Fund has been reimbursed to the amount of $316,611.81, which represents the full amount of the original appropriation of 1921, with some interest added. The balance to the amount of $115,268.95, was credited to the State Equipment and Material Fund. Outstanding assets to the amount of $2,490.16 are with the Tax Commissioner for collection. The Material Yard stock and equipment are fully disposed of and this activity ter - minated. ; 2. CONSOLIDATIONS UNDER SECRETARY OF LABOR A. The Departments of Labor and Welfare were consolidated under the Secretary of Labor, such Secretary becoming ex-bfficio head of the 18 </seg>
            <seg id="p025">Department of Welfare. This consolidation resulted m the elimination of one Code Secretary, and six employees. Based on the original oper - ations of the two separate Departments, a saving of approximately SI 6,000 for 1929 and 1930 was effected. Even with a new industrial safety code, authorized by the Legisla - ture,' and the addition of one man and one woman as inspectors of ma - chinery and working conditions, a net reduction of four employees result - ed, with a net annual saving of $13,300 for 1929 and 1930. 3. CONSOLIDATIONS UNDER THE STATE TREASURER: The Gasoline Tax Collection Bureau was abolished and the collection of this tax placed under the State Treasurer, a Constitutional officer, at a saving of $8,160 for the biennium, and the elimination of a Bureau head at $300 per month and a helper, and the release of two office rooms and maintenance thereof. That this consolidation is feasible is found m the fact that the heavy work of the State Treasurer as such comes largely from the Ist to the 10th of the month, and the gasoline tax collections are received from the 10th to the 20th. 4. CONSOLIDATION UNDER THE GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION: The Fish and Game Bureau m the Department of Agriculture, and the State Park Board of seven members, were merged into a new bipar - tisan Game, Forestation and Parks Commission. This splendid activity functions without any tax monies and is supported solely by the receipts from hunting and fishing license fees. The Commission is working har - moniously and successfully. • In 19.29 and 1930 more than live and one-half million fish (prac - tically all of which were fingorling and adult fish) were placed m the public waters of the state, and 1,000 pair of game birds, such as Hun - garian partridges, quail and turkeys, were released m different parts of the state. Lakes, river frontage and other recreational grounds are being acquired at a reasonable cost for the u"se of the people for all time. At the beginning of 1929 there were eight publicly-owned bodies of water and recreational places m the state. With the thirteen meandering western Nebraska lakes, comprising five thousand acres of water, taken by Legislative Act, and those secured by the Commis - sion through gift and purchase, there are now forty-two publicly owned bodies of water and recreational places open to the public. * T'nis year also many thousands of trees were planted. 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p026">This constructive program represents a sound public policy, will keep Nebraska money at home and give to all our citizens a better knowledge of Nebraska, as well as afford recreational places and fish - ing and hunting grounds for all the people. The new policy of adminis - tration for game, forestation and fish has effected a saving of $34,000 m property taxes for 1929 and 1930. The Commission is operated on Nebraska's "Pay as you go" plan. Even with the full payment for all purchases authorized, the Commission should end the biennium with a balance of $100,000, none of which represents property taxes. As evidence that the work of the Commission is effective and approved by the people, the Fish and Game license fees have increased 20 per cent this year. 5. CONSOLIDATIONS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE: A. The Guarantee Fund Commission was abolished by Act of Legislature m April, 1929. B. Liquidation of all failed bank assets was placed under the Sec - retary -of the Department of Trade and Commerce, who by law is made receiver of all failed banks. All failed banks are now under his charge as receiver, except some of the old Guarantee Fund Commission banks which are m receivership' under former Guarantee Fund Commissioners as provided by law and appointment by the courts. ' C. The abolition of the Guarantee Fund Commission and commit - ment cf receiverships to the Secretary of Trade and Commerce has resulted m a reduction m the number of employees and a saving of approximately §28,000 for the biennium. This means a saving of this amount to the depositors, even though there have been many additional failed banks supervised. D. The new bank law passed m April, 1929, providing for more effectiye bank supervision and the appointment of a Bank Commis - sioner for six years, with a further provision that the salary of the Bank Commissioner (fixed at $7,500.00 per year) and the salaries of all bank and building and loan company examiners be paid by the banks and building and loan companies, ' instead of by the state as formerly, has resulted m a saving of salaries and expenses m the Department of Trade and Commerce and Bureau of Banking of $60,000.00 for the biennium. This saving has been made possible not only by consolidation with another Department, but by centralized bookkeeping and accounting of all failed banks at the Capitol. 20 </seg>
            <seg id="p027">E. In addition, by reason of the consolidation of the Bureau of Securities under the Insurance Commissioner and other economies ef - fected, there was an additional saving of $8,000.00 m the Department of Trade and Commerce over 1927 and 1928. Even with an increase of the salary of the Secretary of the. Department of Trade and Com - merce from $5,000.00 to $7,500.00 per year, which is the same amount as was received by the Secretary of the Guarantee Fund Commission, which position has been abolished, the total savings because of the consolidation, reorganization and new bank law, have been $70,000.00 m property taxes and $28,000.00 to the depositors. ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ . . . .."' 6. CONSOLIDATIONS UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE: ' Registration of Trade Marks was transferred from the Depart - ment of Labor to the Secretary of State, a Constitutional Officer. 7. CONSOLIDATION UNDER DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS: A. The Bureau of Registration of automobile licenses and of Drivers' Licenses has been reorganized since the passage of the new registration law, with the elimination of seven employees, resulting m a saving of £6,000.00 annually. B. Several consolidations have been effected of road maintenance patrol districts, and others are m process of consummation. In 1929 the number of chief patrolmen was reduced by four with a saving of approximately $16,000 for 1929 and 1930 even though 400 miles of new road were taken over by the state, and the counties relieved of the construction and maintenance of this mileage. There is now a total of 7,000 miles of marked and maintained state roads. The percentage of engineering and administration cost for both construction and maintenance, will show favorably and on the average lower when com - pared with public works, of similar character. C. Under the direction of the Governor all purchasing, except real emergency purchases, are being made through the State Purchasing Department at a great saving. Many articles were formerly purchased without any specifications as to just what had to be furnished. In - cluded under this head were such important articles as trucks and lubricating oils. Detailed and comprehensive specifications are now prepared for all purchases contracted for, and no articles are accepted that do not comply with the specifications. The new system is proving satisfactory to both the state and responsible manufacturers. Some - time ago the Governor also directed that the State's needs for all maintenance gravel spread by the State be supplied through competitive bids. Reference is made to the Department of Public Works and the Purchasing Department as to saving on this item, and license plates. 21 </seg>
            <seg id="p028">8. CUSTODY OF CAPITOL WAS TRANSFERRED: In addition to the above the custody of the new Capitol, on recom - mendation of the Governor, was transferred to the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, a Constitutional officer, who is giving an efficient and economical administration m the care of this great build - ing. ■ • •:■■;■ I also desire to state that all transfers and consolidations above referred to, because of the efficient and economical administration of the public officials now m charge, have been entirely justified. TAXATION No tax system yet devised has brought permanent solution of the tax problem nor one universally accepted. Even new taxation methods as well as old ones, serve only as a guide to progress. Whether old or new,, the methods are criticized and condemned, and even the best are inequitable to a degree. If we have one system or several, we wish we had another or different ones. Since the debate on methods, no matter what we do, will continue' indefinitely should we not seriously direct our attention to better admin - istration of the laws we have, strive for economy of expenditure and equalization of burdens on the basis of ability to pay as applied to both persons and property. This does not mean that we should tax only a few who are amply able to pay, and release others who even m moder - ate circumstances can afford to pay for the benefits of government they receive. ; ■ ■ It does mean that we should relieve, mainly by a better distribution of the tax burden, any kind of property which pays too much tax com - pared to the return it gives. Under present conditions there is no doubt that real estate, and especially homes and farm lands, bears too .great a burden. This is one of the major problems confronting this Legislature. The Legislature will not solve the problem by finding new sources of revenue, if the new revenue is absorbed by needless activities or those of doubtful value. It is useless to talk about substitute taxes .because if we abandon one form we pay m some other way, either directly or indirectly. The so-called substitute taxes usually turn out to be additional taxes. We pay m tariffs on the goods we buy, m the rents we pay, m the extra service we exact. All taxes and all overhead of business is shifted when - ever possible. So m the final analysis our tax bills are largely the result of our own action. The small state tax of $2.34 on each ?1,000 assessed 22 </seg>
            <seg id="p029">valuation of property is determined by the action of our representatives m the Legislature. The larger amount of $30 to $35 on each $1,000 assessed valuation of property which we pay for county, city, village and school district government is determined by our local officers. .We can do much to relieve this situation by taking more interest m our own tax business at home. This is where the real tax problem is. Strict budget systems for all governmental sub-divisions, of which we are notified m advance will be an aid. When also we curtail our de - mands for new improvements until we pay or reduce the bonds for the old ones, we will make real progress. • I submit therefore, for your consideration the following: First, a stringent budgeting system for every governmental sub - division m Nebraska. Any law passed on this subject should provide for official inquiry by a reasonable number of taxpayers into all budgets and bond issues, with a reasonable and fair provision of appeal. • Second, Abolition of local assessors and a strong assessing and re - viewing agency m all county tax matters.. Third, I suggest study of what is claimed 'to be a model and bal - anced system of taxation sponsored by the National Tax Association, composed of members of State Tax Commissioners, specialists, heading economists and businessmen. This outline is as follows: 1. A general property tax of reduced scope. 2. Personal income tax levied upon all residents of the state. •3. A business tax upon all business activities carried on within the borders of the state. 4. Inheritance taxes. ''.■ ■ - ■ ■ ■ * 5. Special taxes relating to financial institutions, public utilities and severance taxes (Severance taxes are provided m states which have timber and minerals). No hasty or ill-considered action should be taken m working out any tax program. Any new form of taxation adopted should be on a mod - erate and reasonable basis, and made with the thought of finding addi - tional revenue from new sources such as property or persons who do not now pay a fair share of the cost of government. As evidence that we are not helpless m this matter I direct your attention to the additional revenue of almost $2,000,000 secured m the last two years as a result of laws recommended by me. Only one-sixth of this new revenue goes to the state, the balance being divided among the counties, cities, villages and school districts. All of this added revenue came from sources other than preperty taxes, or from property which had not heretofore paid anything for the support of either state or local government. In con - sidering a taxation plan it might be the part of wisdom to study Ne - 23 </seg>
            <seg id="p030">braska's conditions and needs, through a tax commission, the report of which would be submitted to the next legislature. GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION One of the finest compensations which has come to me as Governor has been the part which I have had m establishing the Commission on a bi-partisan basis, not only for the purpose of- the propagation and protection of game and fish, but for the purpose of insuring to all future generations of Nebraska the legacy of public recreational places. When you and I were young we could fish and hunt anywhere. Today we meet the posted trespass warning. Fishing and hunting grounds and recreational places for the public are decreasing m number year by year. It is reassuring when m a -year and a half Nebraska has acquired two hundred miles of shore line on the lakes and streams of the state. It is reassuring also when through the energy and interest of this Commission, Nebraska is one of the first states to be selected as a site for the purchase and supervision by the government of 40,000 acres of land as a migratory bird reservation. The recent purchase by the government of the reserve m Garden County, Nebraska, is deserving of our notice and commendation. - ■ ■ •'...• This new agency, the successor of two former state agencies, the Fish and Game Bureau and the Park Board, is taking note of existing conditions and, as outlined by my discussion of this subject under the Code, is determined to save the outdoors for our children. The Commission is determined also, when the proper time comes and when the Legislature provides a way, to undertake a forestation program consistent with the needs of a prairie state. Under the law we are commended to forestate, but beyond a limited extent m con - nection with properties acquired as fishing, hunting and recreational grounds, we are unable to execute your mandate. It would be a splendid thing, if Nebraska could outline a policy under the joint direction of. the Conservation Department of the Uni - versity and this Commission to undertake a practical plan for foresta - tion on some of the cheap school lands of the state, and from which the permanent school funds receive meager return, or upon the other lands more centrally located which may be available. FORT KEARNY Nebraska is fortunate m having within its boundaries the site of one of the most historical military posts ever established on the Oregon Trail. By an act of Congress approved May 19, 1846, military stations were established on the route to Oregon. President James K. Polk made requisition on the Governor of Missouri for five companies of 24 </seg>
            <seg id="p031">volunteers for garrison duty and protection of the great migration then moving westward. These . companies under the command of Col. D. P. Woodbury, located a military post m October, 1847, on the site afterward named Fort Kearny. Construction began the following year. It is estimated that two million people passed through Fort Kearny up to the time it was abandoned m 1871; sometimes as many as five hundred covered wagons passed m one day. Fort Kearny is located four miles south and four miles east of the city of Kearney, and nine miles north and three miles west of Minden, on a splendid graveled road, . Highway No. 10, connecting the D. L. D. at Minden and the Lincoln Highway at Kearney. The state, by legislative Act, accepted at the last session, from the Fort Kearny Memorial Association, the historic site of Old Fort Kearny. It should be suitably marked and improved by the state, so that it can be properly administered by the Game, Forestation and Parks Commission as one of the outstanding historical places of the western country. I respectfully ask that you give a hearing to the Memorial Association through whose efforts this famous site has been rescued for public use. 1 SOME ESSENTIAL POLICIES In my budget message I stated my position as to certain policies and herein refer to others which I think should obtain as to activities of importance I enumerate them as follows: 1. The policy of justly fostering every part of a splendid educational system by proper maintenance and support. 2. The policy by proper care and maintenance of the present hu - mane and intelligent administration of Nebraska penal and charitable institutions. By special legislative act the Legislature should direct the Board of Control to provide investigation and treatment of insane patients before the commitment to a State hospital becomes complete. In several states and especially Colorado, the experience m this process of admittance to state hospitals for insane saves to society many of its citizens. The humane results as well as the economic gain justify the adoption of such a policy. 3. The policy by proper maintenance and support of encouraging on a practical basis those agencies and departments which promote agri - culture, our basic industry. As stated m my budget message we should adopt a state-wide plan for bovine tuberculosis eradication. We should also provide a proper Dairy Department m the Agricultural Department, one commensurate with the needs of a great and important industry. We should also tax all butter substitutes at least ten cents a pound and require sufficient license fees for all dealers. 25 </seg>
            <seg id="p032">4. The policy of doing everything possible through a well organized and coordinated welfare [bureau to place m homes dependent helpless children rather than committing them to state homes. 5. The policy of protecting the health, lives and welfare of those m employment by an adequate administration of the Labor Safety Code, ether laws and rules of administration pertaining to those m industry and just compensation m case of disability or death. I refer especially lev my Inaugural Address , two years ago as to my views on these ques - , tions as well as the fundamentals involved. 6. The continuation of our present policy of acquiring and preserv - ing historical sites of reali value as well as preserving the State's history through the Historical Society. The affairs of the Historical Society are ably conducted and it will be of greater value with its permanent loca - tion m the new State Capitol. 7. A policy of conservation and utilization of the flood and waste vaters of the state fqr many beneficial purposes. The survey authorized two years ago and which should be continued will give the state invalu - able data as to its water .resources. 8. The policy of encouraging Nebraska's industry as well as agri - culture. To this end I favor a law similar to the Colorado Code which provides that for all public work consideration to the amount of a small percentage difference shall be given to Nebraska manufacturers, busi - nessmen and producers. Nebraska also needs new incorporation laws so that there will be no reason for the incorporation of Nebraska capital under the laws of other states nor the prevention of the location of outside capital m Nebraska. 9. The policy of modest publicity on a practical basis as discussed under separate heading m this message. STATE PUBLICITY The Department of Publicity was organized under the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture to expend a sum of $10,000 annually, voted by the last Legislature for advertising Nebraska. Recognizing its first duty to be that of informing Nebraskans themselves of the resources and development of their great state, a news service to Nebraska news - papers and Nebraska radio stations was instituted. An average of 250 news articles prepared by the Department have been run without charge m Nebraska newspapers each week and seven radio stations are using a weekly news release without cost to the state. Realizing that a recog - nition and appreciation of Nebraska history is essential to the develop - ment of a vigorous state pride, the Department has acquainted the people with many historic incidents and characters and encouraged the study of Nebraska history. Three editions of a booklet, "Nebraska Nuggets," 90,000 copies, containing facts about Nebraska^ have been printed and 26 </seg>
            <seg id="p033"/>
            <seg id="p034">distributed, besides other printed matter of value to a better under - standing of Nebraska and its resources. The Department fostered and executed a plan for a large exhibit map, portraying Nebraska and its resources, an instructive feature at the 1930 Nebraska State Fair, that was a most effective piece of state advertising. The Department has written many hundreds of letters of information about Nebraska. When - it is known that some other states appropriate large sums for advertis - ing purposes (Kentucky $50,000 a year), it will be recognized that the Nebraska Department has operated under a very modest sum and re - ceived a good deal for the money. I have recommended no increase m appropriation but the work should be continued on the reasonable and beneficial basis on which it is now functioning. THE STATE CAPITOL AND CAPITOL COMMISSION The new State Capitol is the pride of every Nebraskan; it is one of the great buildings of the world. It is outstanding structurally and architecturally. In type it represents not only the broad prairies of our state, but its magnificent tower 400 feet high, the aspirations of .our people. It has been well constructed and Nebraska has received full value for its expenditure. Nebraska can commend the Capitol Commission m performing a fine public service. Three outstanding citizens of Nebraska, Judge William H. Thompson of Grand Island, Walter W. Head of Omaha, and W. E. Hardy of Lincoln, have served for more than ten years. On account of increasing business respon - sibility, Mr. Head has recently resigned. I deferred acceptance of his resignation until yesterday, with the hope that he might arrange his business and continue to serve on the commission. I have not filled the vacancy, considering it a proper courtesy to the Governor-elect, who will be chairman of the commission, to have the opportunity of choosing the Nebraskan who will serve with him on this important work. I deem it my duty at this time to commend the great ability, the devotion and unselfish service which Walter Head has given to . his state as a member of the Capitol Commission. He is en - titled to the gratitude of Nebraska. He retires with the respect and confidence of those who have been associated with him m the erection of this great monument to the pioneers, to the soldiers of all our wars and to Nebraska ideals. The Capitol is nearing completion; it will.be finished within two years. I herewith submit a report from the Nebraska State Capitol Com - mission by its Secretary, R. L. Cochran, as to both the actual and authorized expenditure as of December 1, 1930. Also as to the amount required for landscaping, additional furnishings, paintings, architec - tural work and supervision. The amount of actual and authorized expenditure is the sum of $9,412,089.99. The estimate of the balance needed for final completion of building and grounds is the sum of $667,500. 27 </seg>

Reference is made to tHe full report covering the subject of the deficit to be found on pages 1390-1412, House Journal, 1927. By charging each year with the respective amount |which should have been levied during the year m which the deficit was| made, and by giving credit on the levy made m 1927 when provision for the total deficit was made by mandate of the Legislature, the table showing the original levy would be corrected to read as follows: 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 '; 1927 1928 1929 1930 3.3 2.66 2.15 2.17 2.51 2.21 2.25 2.06 2.4 2.34 Mills (No deficit m 1921.) (No deficit m 1927 to 1930, inclusive.) ■ I ."-■•."■.. It is a sound and fair, contention that capital investments are no part of the administrative expense of government. Likewise the amount of maintenance necessary is determined by the requirements of the student and inmate population of the educational, charitable and penal institutions. Levies therefore made m • any year for the above pur - 32 </seg>
            <seg id="p041">poses can only be compared with others when the difference m amounts for said purposes are taken into consideration. Wherefore the levies for 1922 to 1930, inclusive, would be as follows on the basis of the same capital investments and maintenance: 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 3.69 3.05 2.64 2.66 2.64 2.31 2.49 2.3 2.4 2.34 Mills Different emergencies confront each Legislature and the needs vary m amount. The lowest appropriation for this purpose was $272, - -212.08 m 1923, and the highest was $807,621.21 m 1929, over half of the latter being m connection with the complex bank situation. Corrected on the basis of difference m emergency appropriations during this period, the table would read as follows: ■" 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 T 3.725 3.085 2.72 2.74 2.655 2.325 2.53 2.34 2.4 2.34 Mills It is also sound and fair to recognize that m the years 1922, 1923 and 1924, appropriations were made for purposes not provided m 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928 or 1929. Reduction therefore of 78/100 of a mill for a million dollar appropriation for a Soldiers' Relief Fund (the interest of which goes for soldier relief) and one and one-half million dollars to meet Federal Aid on roads out of property tax m 1922. Also for each of the years 1923 and 1924 there should be reduction of 23/100 of a mill, required to raise $750,000,00 each year to meet Federal Aid out of property tax.- The levy table corrected on above basis would read as follows: ■ 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 2.945 2.305 2.49 • 2.51 2.655 2.325 2.53 2.34 2.4 2.34 Mills Likewise it is sound and fair to take into account the difference m the proper deductions for unappropriated receipts going to the Gen - eral Fund before the tax levies were made. These fees have increased from $785,000.00 m 1921 to $1,086,000.00 m 1929. Taking this difference into consideration for each year, the levy table, corrected, would read as follows: ■. . 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 2.855 2.245 2.44 2.43 2.585 2.285 2.48 2.31 2.4 2.34 MilU It is also proper to recognize the change of the fiscal year m 1921 from April Ist to July Ist, and appropriations for the biennium of 1921-22 were increased by $2,561,944.56 to pay for the cost of govern - ment and maintenance for this additional three-month period. The levy table, corrected on this basis, would read as follows: 33 </seg>
            <seg id="p042">1921 1922 1923 1924 1926 1928 1927 1928 1929 1930 2.466 1.845 2.44 2.43 2.685 2.285 2.48 2.31 2.4 2,34m15. Inasmuch also as there was levied for the erection of the State Capitol, during the years 1921, 1922, 1923 and 1924, eight-hundredths of a mill more than m succeeding years, a fair comparison requires a correction for this table, as follows: 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 2.375 1.765 2.36 2.35 2.585 2.285 2.48 2.31 2.4 2.34m15. NOTE:— The state levy of 2.34 mills for 1930 means $2.34 to be paid on each $1,000 of assessed valuation for state purposes. This amount is used m expenditure for the following purposes: For the University and four Normal Schools (expended by Constitutional Board of Regents and Normal School Board) . i 51.17 For the 17 penal and charitable institutions under the Constitutional Board of Control 83 For the Supreme and District Courts. .12 For construction of new Capitol Building 22 $2.34 Consequently, the State officers, all other state agencies, and ex - pense, except those supported by special receipts, are paid, not out of real estate taxes, but from the state's one-sixth share of the intangible tax and miscellaneous fees which go into the General Fund.- The average levy for ten years (see first levy table herein, Exhibit "D") shows that the state has expended out of property taxes for all purposes an average of 2.41 mills annually. Prior to 1927 taxes for emergency appropriations were levied one-half for' each year of the biennial period. Since 1927 the law requires levies for this purpose to be added to the first year of the biennium. Consequently the levy for 1929 included m that year provision for all emergency appropriations which required twelve and one-half hundredths more mills than under the former system. The levy therefor for 1930 was reduced, to the amount of 2.34 mills, making the average for the present biennium 2.37 mills, which is below the average for the last ten years. These comparative tables could be extended by giving consider - ation to other items such as the appropriation of $60,000.00 for new statutes, the first appropriation of this kind since 1921, $25,000.00 for surveying the water resources of the state both appropriated m 1929, the higher assessed valuations during the first G years of the 10 year period, etc., but the above analysis is sufficient for a comparison of levies. The levy tables have been verified by the State Tax Com - missioner from state records. 34 </seg>
            <seg id="p043">In the consideration of their tax problem, which is always an intricate and vexatious one, our people must not overlook the fact that we are on a sound pay-as-you-go policy, and that each year we ap - propriate money for capital investments. Appropriations for this pur - pose alone would make an annual difference of 65/100 of a mill and reduce the average levy necessary during this period for state admin - istration cost and maintenance to 1.76 mills. During this ten-year period Nebraska, instead of following the policy of all other states except one, of issuing bonds for many capital purposes, has included this average 65/100 of a mill m our annual tax levies to cover capital requirements, which m that period amount to $20,575,457.00. This money has been expended for new buildings, permanent improvements, a new State Capitol, and the investment of two million dollars for a permanent Soldiers Relief Fund (the interest of which goes for relief of disabled soldiers of the World War and their dependents) and four and one-half million dollars from 1921 to 1924, inclusive, for permanent roads before the passage of the gasoline tax. Nebraska's financial position today is the strongest m its history. It has no outstanding bonds or registered warrants. It has ?1 218 785 87 —m the General Fund and ?4,181,860.29— cash Jan. 1, 1931, on hand m all funds. Under a law passed m 1927 the State Board of Equalization is required to levy from 3% to 5% m excess of the amount of the ap - propriations made, so as to cover the 2% charge made by counties for collecting state taxes and to cover the small annual shrinkage m tax collections. This requirement for the years of 1927, 1928 and 1929 made an additional annual levy of 8/100 of a mill. This represents a sound state policy and will prevent future deficits. COMPARISON OF STATE AND LOCAL LEVIES A comparison of the average total state levies with the average levies of cities as well as the average levies for all purposes will furnish our citizens with additional definite information as to the rela - tive cost of state and local government. . AVERAGE STATE LEVY 1921-1930 (This average being more than the levy requirements for 1929-30) 2.41 mills TOTAL AVERAGE LEVY IN THE 93 COUNTY SEAT TOWNS (Which includes state, county, school districts, city, village, and all local purposes). ' 34 5 mmß AVERAGE LEVY IN THE STATE FOR ALL PURPOSES FOR THE YEAR 1929 (The average is secured by dividing the total taxes levied for all state, county, city, village, town - ship, school district, and other purposes, by the total assessed valuation) 18 0 mlUa 35 </seg>
            <seg id="p044">Stated' m another way, m 1929 eighty-seven cents of the average tax dollar m Nebraska was expended locally and for purposes over which local communities had entire control. The other thirteen cents for state purposes was approved by the representatives of local com - munities m the State Legislature. The office of member of the Legis - lature therefore is one of the most important offices m the state, and the people should be as careful m their selection of such an official as m the selection of a Governor. Both have great powers and one of the most important of these is the authority to appropriate and expend public funds. From the foregoing taxation tables it is apparent that our taxes are largely local, and within the control of the local sub-divisions of government. It is also apparent that even m the smaller expenditure for the state, the State Equalization Board is governed largely m fixing, the levy by the action of the representatives of the people m the Legislature. It is likewise apparent that as long as our State Consti - tution provides for a state educational system and for the maintenance of the unfortunate and dependent wards of the state, and for proper buildings to house and protect them, and for which purposes we are expending practically all of our state taxes, we should cease conducting biennial sham battles over the small and necessary cost of our state government. While it is our constant duty to eliminate extravagance, abolish useless agencies and co-ordinate and consolidate others, our real prob - lem is to equalize the burdens of government and to place upon our tax rolls property which unjustly escapes its fair share of the cost of government. As governor, I have directed my efforts to these ends. 36 </seg>
