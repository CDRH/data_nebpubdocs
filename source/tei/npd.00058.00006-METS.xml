            <seg id="p021">LEASING AND SALE OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS 21 RULES AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO THE LEASING AND SALE OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS Lease Contracts The Commissioner of Public Lauds and Buildings may at least one in 'each year designate a day and hour for offering in a public mannei, at the office of the county treasurer in the respective counties, least contracts on all of the educational lands, which mfciy be subject to lease in that county at the time of such offering. The same shall be subject to lease at an annual rental of six (G) per cent on the appraised value. Provided, that if two or more parties desire to lease tihe same land, the officer having control of the auction shall lease to the person who will pay the greater amount of cash bonus in addition to six (6) per cent on the appraised value as annual rental. Lease rentals are due in two installments, January 1 and July 1 ox each year. If not paid within six months after due, the lease holders are declared delinquent and notice is sent them if their postoffice ad - dresses are known; if unknown, advertisement is made in a newspaper. Ninety days after date of such notice lease contracts are declared for - feited and are subject to auction thereafter. (See Fees.) Delinquent lease holders are not permitted to bid at the sale of the lands they have forfeited, but at any time before the land is actually put on the auction block they may reinstate their leases by paying a'! back rentals and penalty fees. (See Fees.) All school lands under lease are subject to appraisement at any time the Board of Educational Lands and Funds so elect. All leases expire twenty-five years from the first day of January next ensuing after the date of the lease. All lessees have the right, at the expiration of their lease, to apply to the Couny Treasurer for a new lease and receive the same without competition, at the same time surrendering the old lease, paying rentals six months in advance and a lease fee of fifty cents. This will do away with the public auction only in cases wh,ere the former lessee does not apply for new lease. In such cases, the lands will be advertised and leased at public auction to the highest bidder, and all improvements on the land shall be appraised by the County Board. Improvements to be included in such appraisements shall be all build ings, orchards, trees, fencing, wells, cisterns, windmills, pumps, tanks, irrigation improvements, and also costs for labor expended in breaking sod on said tract of land and reducing same to cultivation, and for al - falfa or other crops growing upon said land. The appraisment shall be </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 made within thirty (30) days after the acceptance of the bid. (See page 175, Laws of Nebraska, 1923.) Where lands are forfeited on account of non-payment of rentals the moveable improvements are sold unde:" the direction of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. ( See Page 1655, Compiled Statutes. 1922.) The amount of school land authorized to be leased, direct or by renewal, to one person is limited to 640 acres. rCATIONAL LANDS MAY BE PURCHASED FROM THE STATE AS FOLLOWS: Lands known as isolated tracts; lands situated in the irrigation dis - tricts, and lands for the use of churches, cemeteries, school house sites, county agricultural fairs and public roads. Any lessee of land situated within the areas irrigated or to be irri - gated from irrigation works constructed or controlled (or to be con - structed or controlled by the United States or its duly authorized agenc - ies) or any lessee of any forty-acre tract or government subdivision, any part of which is under irrigation, may purchase the same. (See pa&amp;e 185, Laws of Nebraska, 1923.) The lav also provides that if any forty (40) acre tract adjacent to other school land which is wholly or partly under irrigation and there - fore subject to sale, such tract may be sold even though not under irrigation, if in the opinion of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings it 'f expedient to sell the same. Any irrigation districts in which there is, or may be any educational lands belonging to the state which are or may hereafter become sites for reservior purposes, may purchase from the state for reservior sites such educational land, or portion thereof. (See page 358, Laws of Nebraska, 1325.) The law provides that the Commissioner of Public Lands and Build - ings shall make a list of all isolated tracts of school lands containing less than forty (40) acres and all undivided interests in realty and all city lots held by the State of Nebraska in trust for the permanent sfbocl fund; appraise same, and upon the expiration of the leases and where the lease title has been forfeited, offer the same for sale at nuhlic auc - fc. To be sold by the County Treasurer of the county in which the Is are located, to the highest bidder for not less than ninety (90) per cent of the appraised value. The purchaser shall pay not less than twenty-five (25) per cent in cash on day of sale, and the balance to be secured by sale contract running ten years at six (6) per cent annual interest; the purchaser having the right to pay all of the unpaid pur - chase money, or any part of it in multiples of five (5) -percent of tbi total purchase price at any interest payment date. Tn the event the purchaser or the assignee does not pay the annual interest upon the unpaid purchase price within six (6) months after interest becomes due. the land shall revert to the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">LEASING AND SALE OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS 23 SALE CONTRACTS The owner of a sale contract may, at any time, pay any portion of the purchase price thereof bo the treasurer of the county in which the land is situated; provided all interest at that time earned and due has first been paid ; and when tlhe principal is paid in full, other than the first of the year, interest upon the obligation having been paid for the entire year, the County Treasurer, receiving such principal payments may refund to the payor, out of any interest money then, in his hands, the interest so paid in advance in excess of the amount earned and due at the time said final payment is made. Refund receipts are furnished by the Land Commissioner for this purpose. All unpaid principal on sale contracts draws interest at five (5) per cent per annum, payable annually on January first of each year, in advance Sale contract holders making final payment to the County Treasurer should also surrender their contracts, that same may be forwarded to Land Commissioner with receipts showing the full pay - ment. NOTES No assignment of a school land lease or sale contract is walid until recorded in the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, and will not be recorded if any interest or rental is due at the time daid assignment is offered for record. The original sale or lease contract must be sent in with the assignment or the latter will not be recorded. The contract will be returned with the recorded assignments. When a sub-division, of not less than forty acres in any contract is assigned, a new number is given the assigned 'portion on the ledger account, and a certified copy of the original should be given Do the as - signee. When assignments are made as above, the original contract must be reduced and the interest or rentals as the case may be is ad - justed to the new conditions. Whenever a lease or sale contract becomes lost or destroyed, a certified copy of the same may be procured by filing an affidavit of lost contract. Such copies may be used in lieu of the original for the purpose of passing title. When interest on a sale contract or rental on a lease contract i» not paid when due, the county treasurers will collect "penalty" interest at 7 per cent for the time purchaser or lessee hjas been tardy in making such payments. k Improvements on leased land, and the owner's equity in land under sale contract are subject to taxation. County treasurers are requested to send in school land receipts at </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 least once each week. Sometimes tardiness in this particular leads to considerable unnecessary correspondence and occasionally to delin- quencies being charged against contract holders who are not in arrears, but whose receipts have not been sent to the Land Commissioner's office. Lands escheating to the state under the alien act are appraised and leased in the same manner as educational lands. FEES For the issuance of a lease or sale contract $0.50 For recording assignments, for each contract assigned 50 For recording affidavit of lost contract 50 For certified copy of a contract 75 For recording any instrument, each 100 words 10 For notice of forfeiture of lease or sale contract 50 For reinstatement t&gt;0 For recording order of forfeiture, where'redemption is made before auction, for each tract of 40 acres or less 50 Where publication in newspaper is required in lieu of ordinary de - linquent notice, the actual cost of such publication is charged where redemption is made.

            <seg id="p025">DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING 25 DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING E. C. Simmons State surveyor and Draughtsman The original evidence of land surveys in the State of Nebraska, consisting of about eight hundred bound books and the official plats derived and made up therefrom, were transferred to the state under the provisions of sections 2218, 2219 and 2220, United States Revised Statutes, and are in the custody of this office. A resume of the law governing the care of these records and the duties of the state surveyor, as set forth by Mr. Robert Harvey in a previous Biennial Report, is as follows : "The statutes of 1903 defined the duties of the State Surveyor and Draughtsman, and placed in his direct charge, under the supervision of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, the field notes, and all other records of the Government Surveys of Public Lands in the state, conduct the correspondence pertaining to the surveys, grievances or disputes growing out of conflicting surveys of lands and lots, to prepare the advice or intructions and opinions and issue a circular of instructions to county surveyors of the state for their direction and guidance in the restoration and establishment of lines and preservation of corners, in conformity with the laws, rules and regulations governing the surveys of the United States and establishing rules of surveying, and perform such other duties as may be required by the Commissioner; and in case of any disputes among land owners or by reason of any survey of boundaries of lands within the state, or of disputes or dis - agreements between surveyors as to the survey of boundaries, when petitioned for, shall be referred to the State Surveyor, who is made the arbitrator to determine and settle such disputes by making the necessary examinations and surveys to settle the 'same, and whose de - cisions shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness thereof." "The law also provides for an appeal to the courts from decisions of the State Surveyor in making such surveys by any person having an interest in the lands affected by such surveys." "It also provides that the per diem of the surveyor for each day's service while engaged in field work and necessary expenses shall be paid by the parties having the work done. The per diem of the State Surveyor is to be paid into the general fund of the state. The law was amended in 1909, providing for the appointment of experienced and competent land surveyors as deputies. The law was also amended in 1919, which provided that when surveys were made by the State Sur - veyor in person, his per diem is to be $8.00 per day for each day while engaged in the work, which per diem is to be ipaid into the general fund of the state ; he is to receive the return of his necessary expenses. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 Deputies are also to receive $8.00 for each day spent in field work and their necessary expenses." BOOKS AND RECORDS Before the introduction of electric lights in the vaults gas wa. - used and the products of combustion so rotted the covers of several ol" the books of field notes that they are in bad condition and should be re - bound. However, by the use of binding tape these records are well cared for. Many department resurveys made by the United States Govern - ment under the supervision of the General Land Office have been fileu in this office. The plats, have been carefully iassorted and classified and the field notes arranged and bound in book form consisting of twelve nine by fourteen inch volumes, each being two inches thick. Th&gt; maps of the Alt Surveys, which are independent and in many places far removed from the original lines and corners, have also been classified and arranged accordingly. The index and abstract of original field notes and maps, a very valuable compilation, has been permanently bound. This book is too elaborate for a working index and a more simple form has been adopted, which greatly facilitates the work of the office. . The reports of inspection of U. S. surveys, with graphic represent - ations, as compiled and elaborated by Mr. Harvey, are still in loose leaf form and should be permanently bound. OVERLAPPING SURVEYS It might be opportune to state that while the dependent surveys of the government follow the original lines and the surveyors have marked the original boundaries of the school sections of the state, in several townships a "metes and bounds" system has been adopted, somewhat complicated in its nature and consisting of interferences and overlaps which will (eventually lead to interminable litigation between owners of adjacent lands. Our school lands are not exempt from these overlaps and there are designing people who are attempting to deprive the school children of this state of their rightful heritage. It is hardly tenable to argue that the state is rich and can afford to lose these lands. Tin state is simply a trustee for the school children and holds these lands in a fiduciary capacity. The state and its schools should be protected against all such onslaughts. </seg>

Respectfully, Witnesses : Names of Applicants: Note: One dollar filing fee must accompany each application.. See Sections 4864 to 4870 inclusive, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, "A resurvey must be initiated at some yell-defined, identified, and unquestioned starting point on the original surveys. It must terminate at some equally well-known and identified point."

This, together with the uses of the waters of the state for irrigation, ihas caused many small islands to form and many 1 channels to narrow or become entirely obliterated. Several surveys have been made through this office for the pur- pose of establishing lines between riparian claimants and many letters making inquiry as to the ownership of lands thus formed have been received. As a general rule fractional lots along navigable streams, like the Missouri, extend' to the water's edge only and accretions are distributed proportional to the entire length of the new shore as compared with the old. But in non-navigable streams the riparian boundaries are more fixed. In the original surveys- where section lines interesected the banks of a meanderable stream, meander corners were built for the purpose of marking 1 the line between landowners, but they do not usually mark the legal termini of the lands owned. Meander lines were run along the banks about a rod, and sometimes more, from the water's edge not for the purpose of defining the boundaries of the fractional lots, but to determine the areas of the arable land and where the United States has disposed of fractional lots adjacent to shores it claims no marginal lands and ownership extends to the center lines of the channel, which are found by running mean courses halfway between opposite meander lines </seg>
            <seg id="p033">I m i*j £ jfy I Hfl Pj^q j_ !j v^ H V J^X X**i \m 33 I quote here from a letter on this subject received from the Gener - al Land Office: "For authority 1 on this subject, you are referred to the decision of the U. S. Supreme Court in the case of St. Louis v. Rutz (138 U. S, 226). Prom a study of this decision and the cases therein cited, it will be noted: 1. That each State must settle for itself the title to lands formed by accretion within its boundaries, Barney V. Keokuk (94 U. S. '324). 2. That the owner of the fee of the bed of a river or other sub - merged land is the owner of any bar, island or'Vlry land which sub - sequently formed thereon, Mulry v. Horton (100 N. Y. 424). 3. That among the rights of a riparian owner is access to the water front. 4. That the rights of accretion to an island in a river cannot be so extended lengthwise of the river to exclude riparian proprietor above or below such island from access to the river, as suefcr riparian proprie - tor. It would appear therefore that if, under the laws of Nebraska the owner of lot 3 on the south bank of the river is a riparian proprietor entitled to the 'bed of the river (a) to the center of the channel be - tween the island and the south main land and (b) to the center of the main channel of the river, he could not be cut off from the water of the main channel through a claim of the proprietor of the island to that part of the river bed lying east of the island and in front of said lot 3. and that the right of accretion to the island cannot extend length wise of the river. Lateral lines at right angle to the general course of the river shoud be extended from the head and foot of the island as a partition between the accretions, or the like, to the island and to the main land." It would seem, then, that accretions to the main land, as well as new islands, towheads, gravel bars, etc., formed between the mainland and the center line of a channel, 'belong to the riparian proprietor of the shore lands, but that such ownership cannot extend lengthwise of the stream. At variance from the prevailing idea that lines befiween riparian owners run north, east, south or west, as e continuation of bound - aries on the shore, such lines extend from the meander line to the center line of the stream and normal thereto. DESTRUCTION OF SECTION CORNERS Notwithstanding the penal laws enacted by the United States and </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 the State of Nebraska against destroying corner monuments, and the efforts of this office to protect them, their wholesale destruction goes merrily on. The experience of the State Surveyor and 'his deputies in the field is that in many areas, miles in extent, all the section • corners have been destroyed by highway construction, especially by road'super - visors. This office is in receipt of many letters from county surveyors and others 'to the same effect. To aid as much as possible in overcoming this wanton disregard of law the following circular letter has been sent 'to the county board and the county surveyor of each county in the state, but only in a few instances has it been effective. Lincoln, Nebraska March 3, 1926. To the Honorable County Board, 'County. Nebr. Gentlemen : The Board of Public Works has recently awarded a large number of contracts for grading 'and otherwise improving the public highways in all parts of the state. Many of these roads are along section lines and the cuts and fills made by the grading contractors, as well as the work of road supervisors, and the ordinary wear and tear caused by traffic result in the destruction of' the section corners and other land - marks unless measures are taken to protect them. Section 2699, Complied Statutes of Nebraska, 1922,- and Section 3700, as amended in 1925, read as follows: "Section 2699. Landmarks, protection. It shall be the duty of the department of Public Works, the highway commission - ers and every road overseer in the construction and mainten - ance of the public highways, when work is to be done that may cause the destruction of any corners of land surveys, to notify the county surveyor, who shall proceed forthwith to perpetu - ate said corners in the most permanent manner, either by set - ting monuments of durable material or establishing witness corners in at least two directions, who shall 'also perpetuate corners which are being destroyed along the public highways in the same manner and he shall within thirty days thereafter record his notes thereof in the official record of surveys, and where the office of county surveyor 4s supported wholly by fees, such surveyor shall be entitled to the statutory fees upon filing his duly executed voucher, which" 1 shall be allowed by the county commissioners or supervisors out of the general fond of the county." </seg>
            <seg id="p035">DEPARTMENT OF SURVEY 35 "Section 2700. Lost corners, Duty of Officers.— Any road overseer, member of township board, board of county super - visors, board of county commissioners or any highway com - missioner who shall fail or neglect to notify the county sur - veyor, as set forth in the preceding section, shall be liable for the expense of the re-survey and restoration of such corners lost or destroyed and for any damage sustained by the in- terested land owners by reason of such failure or neglect." The sections quoted are clear in this matter 'and I am sending the opinion of the attorney general in which I think your county attorney will concur. The contractors themselves are not supposed to know the location of these corners, and this law does not encumber the road engineers with their preservation further than to notify ' the county surveyors, but they will assist in every way they can. I trust your Honorable Body will not only see your way clear to follow the mandates of the law, but that you will feel somewhat en - thusiastic in carrying out its provisions. ' This office will at all times be glad to cooperate with you and the county surveyor who must fcal free to ask for' information at all times. Very truly yours, DAN SWANSON, Commissioner of Public and 'Buildings. By E. C. SIMMONS State Surveyor. 0. S. SPILLMAN ATTORNEY GENERAL March 1. 1926. Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Sir: You ask for an opinion from this department with reference to the duty of County Boards to see that corners of land surveys are perpet - uated whenever they are in danger of being obliterated by the construc - tion of maintenance of public highways. In compliance with your request for an opinion, I will say 'that I am of the opinion the County Boards of the respective counties should see to it that the corners of land surveys in the x respective counties are perpetuated by the setting of durable monuments or by the establishing of corners in conformity with the provisions of Section 2699, Hon. E. C. Simmons, State Surveyer, </seg>
            <seg id="p036">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 36 Compiled Statutes, 1922 edition, whenever there is danger that the original land marks will he destroyed by the construction or mainten - ance of a public highway. This duty is plainly cast upon them together with other public officials by the provisions of Chapter 92, Session Laws, 1925, which amends Section 2700, Complied Statutes. Very truly yours, O. S. SPILLMAN, Attorney General, By GEO. W. AYERS Assistant Attorney General It is recommended that the coming legislature enact laws to the effect that nd road construction of any kind be done along section lines until such lines are plainly marked and witnessed according to law, with adequate and effective penalties, and that the proper' state of - ficers shall withhold, and no county shall receive any state or govern - ment aid'- in road construction until the County Board has caused the route to be plainly and permanently marked. ADVERSE POSSESSION It should be understood that adverse possession does not affect the position of government lines and corners nor the subdivison of e section. Land acquired by adverse possession may extend beyond these lines but such land is then inclosed by new boundaries. This, however, is a question for a court of equity and the survey - or need not trouble himself about the mntter except to locate such lands with reference to known lines when required to do so or to com - ply'with an order of court. </seg>
