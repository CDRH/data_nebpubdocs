In an 11 -year comparison of seedbed-preparation practices for corn at the Nebraska Agncultural Experiment Station, early spring plowing yielded s'pers 'per cen' more gram per acre than late spring plowing and 18 per cent mtre than fall Slowing 2. In the case o£ late spring plowing, a previous early spring disking increased the yield 3 per cent. Plowing early m the spring to the depths of 4, 554, 7, and 10 inches tor sur face-planted corn yielded respectively 30.5, 31.5, 33.3, and 3i.sbuhels per acre. Plowing deeper than 7 inches may be regarded as impractical. P 3. The extreme variation m yield among 6 methods of seedbed preparation m connection with planting corn m furrows was 3.1 bushels per acre. alike' ThC m ° St Pr ° ductivc listing and surface-planting practices yielded essentially 5 Practically equal yields were obtained during an 11 -year period from surface - planted corn whether checked or drilled. Checked corn has the advantage of being more easily kept free from weeds by cross cultivation. 6. By spacing the corn rows double distance, or 7 feet apart, the yield of grain (6-year average) was reduced 23 per cent when the stand of plants per row remained normal, whereas the reduction was 14 per cent when the number of plants per row was doubled so as to provide the normal number o£ plants per acre. 7. Time-of-planting tests ranging from April 25 to June 14 over a 12-vcar period fail to show consistent superiority for any given date of planting. There was a tendency m most years for either the early- or the late-planted corn to yield the highest, but on the average, corn planted on intermediate dates yielded practically the same. 8. The average yields obtained over a period of years indicate that there may be some departure from a standard planting rate without very materially affecting the yield of grain per acre. In checked corn with the hills spaced 3.5 feet apart, stands of l, j, 5, 4, and 5 plants per hill yielded at the respective rates of 37.3, -16.5 49 5 46 8 and 44.1 bushels per acre, during 14 years. During an 18-year period, corn planted at the rates of 2, 3, 4, and 5 plants per hill yielded 43.6, 46.3, 42.8, and 416 bushels per acre, respectively. An average stand of 2&gt;/ 2 to 3 plants m hills 42 inches apart, or its equivalent m drilled corn, may be regarded as most practical for standard varieties m eastern Nebraska. 9. In a 14-year test to determine the importance of uniform distribution of plants m the field, it was found that compared with 49.9 bushels per acre from a uniform stand of 3 plants per hill, (1) alternating hills with 2 and 4 plants yielded 50 6 bushels, (2) alternating hills with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 plants yielded 50.0 bushels, and (3) alternating hills of 1, 3, and 5 plants yielded 49.3 bushels. This is an average of 30 bushels for the uneven stands. 10. Planter-box samples of seed corn obtained from numerous Nebraska farmers have not been benefited materially by treatment with any of the commercial seed-corn disinfectants and such treatment is not recommended as a general practice m this state. 11. Weed control is the main consideration m corn cultivation. In an 11-year com - parison of various frequencies of cultivation, the plats given 2, 3, and 4 normal culti - vations yielded respectively 31.5, 33.2, and 34.0 bushels per acre. During a 6-year P "la j« n Wlthout cu| t»ation yielded 19 per cent, while that with one cultivation yielded 58 per cent as much as corn receiving 4 cultivations. Continued late cultivation after corn is normally laid by, reduced the yield 0.6 bushel per acre. Corn plats m which the ground surface was merely scraped to control weeds yielded 4.3 bushels per acre less than corresponding areas which received 4 normal cultivations. 12.

Roots which arc cut will generally send out one or more branches, and partial or complete replace - ment may follow. Pruning as deep as 6 inches and completely circumscribing the plants at a distance of 7 inches either at the last cultivation or at all cultivations lowered the grain yield 12 per cent. Similar pruning at the time of second cultivation lowered the grain yield S per cent, while there was no material effect when done only at the first. The most severe pruning, 6 inches deep at a distance of 4 inches, lowered the grain yield 20 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Cultural Practices m Corn Production T. A. KIESSELBACH, ARTHUR ANDERSON, AND W. E. LYNESS • It is the purpose of this bulletin to summarize the comparative tests conducted at the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station pertaining to the preparation of the seedbed for corn and the planting and cultivating of this crop. These experiments extended from 1914 to 1933 and are largely concluded herewith. Earlier results from part of them have been previously reported m Bulletin 232. The most profitable practices will vary with soil and climatic conditions, and local experiences should be considered when applying the results obtained m these tests. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE All comparisons were m multiple-row plats and the outside rows were discarded because of possible border effects. The plat areas generally ranged from 1/40 to 1/10 acre m size. All tests except those pertaining to seedbed preparation were replicated one or more times. The standard spacing of 3.5 feet between rows and hills was maintained for all checked corn. Corresponding rates were secured with the drilled corn by proportionate spacing of single plants within the row. In the wide-row spacing tests only alternate rows were planted. This resulted m a stand of one-half the normal number of plants per acre, except where the full number was pro - vided by spacing the hills 21 rather than 42 inches. Comparable stands were obtained m all of these experiments by planting the corn at a double rate and thinning m the seedling stage to the desired stand. This elim - inated the uncertainties of stand discrepancies. The grain yields are on the basis of air-dry shelled corn per acre. Field - cured stover yields were also determined for the seedbed and intertillaee experiments. SEEDBED PREPARATION In farm practice corn usually follows a previous crop of corn, small grain, or a legume such as clover or alfalfa. The seedbed is commonly prepared either by plowing or listing and may be accompanied by one or more supplementary treatments with the disk and harrow which are designed to destroy weeds and provide a good physical condition of the soil. The period of such preparation may extend from the preceding fall up to the time of planting m the spring, or the work may be done entirely m connection with the planting. During the 11-year period, 1922-32, 13 different methods of seedbed preparation were under comparison on the Experiment Station Farm. In seven of these practices the corn was surface-planted m hills on land that was plowed either m the fall, early spring, or late spring, as specified. In the other six practices, the seed was drilled m open furrows. These were made either by furrow-opener attachments to the corn planter on early - thl T nf . c . xperil ? c " t8 concerninK time and rate of planting were m collaboration with </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 293 spring plowing, or by listing on land that had had either partial prepara - tion in the fall or early spring, or else no previous preparation. A three-year rotation of corn, oats, and winter wheat was followed. In the years intervening between the corn crops the tillage and cropping practices were alike on all plats. The seedbed was prepared for the oats in this rotation by double-disking the corn stubble, and for the winter wheat by plowing the oats stubble 5J/2 inches deep in July, with subsequent disking and harrowing. In preparation for the planting of corn, the treat - ments under comparison were as indicated in Table 1. As an average for the period, all fall treatments were completed on October 6 and the early - and late-spring treatments on March 29 and May 5, respectively. The corn was grown at the rate of three plants per hill, or its equivalent in the case of drilling. The average planting date was May 8. Preparation for surface planting. — Varying with the soil preparation, the yields from surface-planted corn have ranged from 27.4 to 33.5 bushels per acre as an average for 11 years (Table 1). Plowing early in the spring 4 inches deep yielded 30.5 bushels, 5'/2 inches deep 31.5 bushels, 7 inches deep 33.3 bushels, and 10 inches deep 33.5 bushels per acre. In general there has been a consistent increase in yield of grain as the depth of plowing was increased from 4 to 7 inches. This increase was sufficient to justify plowing at a depth of 7 inches, whereas the additional yield increase from the 10-inch depth was so slight as to make it impractical when the greater labor cost is considered. Early spring plowing (March 29) 7 inches deep yielded 5 per cent more than late spring plowing (May 5) and 2 per cent more than late spring plowing preceded by disking. These results suggest that early plowing, especially in the absence of early disking, is more desirable than late plow - ing. Early spring plowing 7 inches deep yielded an average of 18 per cent more than fall plowing at the same depth. The fact that in 8 years out of 11 the yield from fall plowing was decidedly less suggests that this practice is generally undesirable. It is commonly believed that fall plowing tends to stimulate early vegetative growth, which results in a reduced yield in case of pronounced moisture shortage. This tendency is indicated by the lower grain-stover ratio obtained in the fall-plowed plat. On relatively infertile land where overstimulation of vegetative growth is improbable, fall plowing should not be at such a disadvantage. It should be borne in mind that fall-plowed ground is more or less unfavorably subject to soil blowing during the winter. Preparation for furrow planting. — Two devices were used for opening furrows: a furrow-opener attachment for the corn planter and a lister. The furrow openers were used on land plowed 7 inches deep in early spring. There were five different types of listing: (1) double listing in which the first listing was done in the fall and the ridges were listed out in late spring at the time of planting; (2) double listing in which the first </seg>

            <seg id="p008">.'■••. Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 293 was done early in the spring, followed by splitting the ridges at the time of planting; (3) single late-spring listing on 7-inch fall plowing; (4) single late-spring listing on early-spring double-disked ground; and (5) single late-spring listing on ground that received no other preparation than the listing. As an 11-year average the extreme difference between these 6 methods of planting in furrows was only 3.1 bushels per acre. The average yield of these treatments was 32.7 bushels, which is but 0.6 bushel less than that from surface planting on land that was plowed 7 inches deep early in the spring, and 1.2 bushels more than the average of all surface-planting practices. I Double listing in the spring and single listing preceded by early-spring double disking did not yield significantly more than single listing in hard ground. Supplementary seedbed treatments in preparation for listing appear to have value chiefly in cutting up old cornstalks, loosening the soil to facilitate cultivation where it has been consolidated by heavy snows and rains, and aiding in the destruction of early spring weeds. The com - parative effects upon succeeding crops have not been established. Although the difference in yield resulting from the best surface planting and listing practices are probably not significant, it would appear that list - ing, where feasible, is more profitable because of its lower labor require - ments. The stover weights, ratio of grain to stover, date in tassel, stalk height, and percentage of suckers are shown in Table 1 for the 13 methods of seedbed preparation. There is a tendency for the listed corn to have a somewhat higher ratio of grain to stover than does the surface-planted corn. This reflects a somewhat smaller vegetative development without a corresponding reduction in grain yield. Extensive listing tests which are applicable to a large part of central and western Nebraska have been conducted at the North Platte Substation. 2 As a 14-year average, surface-planted corn on plowed land yielded 17.7 bushels per acre, compared with 21.3 bushels for listed corn. This decided advantage for listing in that region may be associated with the commonly less favorable moisture conditions. MANNER OF PLANTING In farm practice, surface-planted /corn may be either checked or drilled, whereas corn planted in furrows is almost always drilled. The spacing between hills of checked corn is usually 42 inches, with two or more plants per hill. Comparable rates are secured in drilled corn by the proper spacing of single plants within the row. The wide spacing of rows by leaving the alternate rows uncropped is practiced to a very limited extent in the west. &gt;L. L. Zook and W. W. Burr.

"Yields for furrow planting are transferred from Table 1, on a comparative basis. They bear the same relation in both tables to the checked corn on early sprint; plowing 7 inches deep. The yield for listing is calculated from the average of the three listing practices in - volving only spring treatments. An 11-year test, 1922-32, comparing four different methods of planting, is summarized in Table 2. Surface-planted corn checked at the rate of three plants to the hill yielded 34.0 bushels per acre as an average for this period, compared with 34.9 bushels for corn drilled at a corresponding rate. These data indicate that checked and drilled corn when surface-planted may be expected to yield about equally when weeds are not a serious factor. One decided advantage of checked corn, however, is that it permits cross cultivation, which facilitates more efficient weed control and may be expected to increase yields under weedy conditions. The corn planted with a lister and that planted with a furrow-opener attachment to the corn planter yielded 2 per cent more and 6 per cent less respectively than did the surface planting on early spring plowing to a depth of 7 inches. During a six-year period, corn grown in double-spaced rows, 7 feet apart, with the normal number of plants (3-plant hills every 42 inches) per row, thereby providing half of the normal number of plants per acre, yielded 28.6 bushels per acre. The grain and stover yields were 77 and 71 per cent respectively of those of normal checked corn. In the case of double-spaced rows in which each row contained twice the normal number of plants (3-plant hills every 21 inches), thereby providing the normal number of plants per acre, the corn yielded 32.1 bushels per acre. The grain and stover yields were 86 and 88 per cent respectively of those of the normal checked corn. Under eastern-Nebraska conditions the planting of corn in alternate rows only, even though the normal number of plants per acre is maintained, will result in a materially lower acre yield and may be regarded as impractical. In a similar test during a six-year period by the North Platte substation, as reported by Zook and Burr, corn planted in alternate rows yielded 1.3 </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 293 bushels or 6 per cent less than normally planted corn when the number of plants per acre was the same in both cases. Where alternate-row planting contained only one-half of the normal number of plants per acre, the yield wa# 5.1 bushels or 24 per cent less than that of normally planted corn. Since the most profitable yields of winter wheat in central and western Nebraska are commonly obtained following corn, it would seem that double spacing of the rows, as a possible means of facilitating the produc - tion of wheat, may merit further usage. TIME OF PLANTING Time-of-planting tests ranging from April 25 to June 14 over a 12-year period (Table 3) fail to show consistent superiority for any given date of planting. During certain seasons late-planted corn was the best.

Factors which cannot be foretold at the beginning of the season such as timeliness of the rains, occurrence of drouth and hot winds, and length of growing season are usually the major influences determining yield. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Cultural Practices in Corn Production During the nine-year period, 1925-33, corn planted as early as April 25 yielded highest during three years and averaged practically the same yield as later dates of planting. During seven years, 1922-28, corn planted as late as June 14 yielded highest only once and averaged materially lower in yield than corn planted at earlier dates. During the five-year period, 1929-33, however, corn planted on June 10 yielded highest during four years and averaged materially higher than corn planted at earlier dates. It may be concluded, therefore, if seed of a standard variety is used, that plantings made from the latter part of April to the first part of June in eastern Nebraska will on the average result in rather similar yields. By spreading the planting season over a considerable period of time, the like - lihood of low yields resulting from any brief period of unfavorable weather becomes less. Losses from immaturity and inferior grain quality may be expected to increase with undue delay in planting. THE RELATION OF STAND TO YIELD Rate of planting per acre.— Experiments have indicated that there may be considerable range in the planting rate of corn or the number of plants grown per acre without greatly affecting the acre yield of grain. The spacing of plants, so far as possible, should be governed by the environ - mental limitations and the type of corn grown. For example, a small or early-maturing type which does not utilize the entire growing season should be grown at a somewhat thicker rate than a full-season type. Under eastern-Nebraska conditions three plants per hill is very suitable for stand - ard varieties, whereas the number may well be increased to five for extremely early sorts that may be planted late for emergency crops or for early feed. Wherever moisture is apt to be a decidedly limiting factor, the rate of planting should be reduced accordingly. A test extending over a 14-year period and comparing five different planting rates of Hogue Yellow Dent, which is a standard full-season type of corn for southeastern Nebraska, is summarized in Table 4. Throughout Table 4. — The relation of the rate of planting of a standard variety to the yield and growth of corn, 191L-17 and 1920-33.

            <seg id="p012">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 293 the comparison, 1914-17 and 1920-29, the seed was planted at a double rate and later thinned in the seedling stage to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 plants in hills which were spaced 42 inches apart each way. These five rates of planting correspond to 3,556, 7,112, 10,668, 14,224, and 17,780 plants per acre, respectively. When grown at the respective rates of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 plants per hill, the corresponding average yields were 37.3, 46.5, 49.5, 46.8, and 44.1 bushels per acre. Using the standard 3-plant rate as a basis, these are relative yields of 75, 94, 100, 95, and 89 per cent. Together with a test of the Krug variety grown at four rates during 1930 to 1933, averages for 18 years may be compiled in which the rates of 2, 4, and 5 plants per hill yielded 94, 92, and 90 per cent as much, respectively, as the 3-plant rate. While striking annual variations occurred because of seasonal climatic differences, the rate of 3 plants per hill yielded highest during 7 of the 14 years. These data suggest that as an average for a period of years the stand may range from 2.5 to 3.5 plants per hill without very materially affecting yields. Considering the increased labor of husking the greater number of smaller ears produced by an unnecessarily thick stand, it would seem wise to strive toward the minimum stand which will yield satisfactorily. The differences in planting rate affected but slightly the stalk and ear heights, the dates of silking and ripening, the shrinkage of ear corn, and the shelling percentage. On the other hand (Table 4) the increases in per - centage of barren plants and the decreases in percentage of two-eared stalks and suckers were striking and consistent with increased rate of planting. Uniformity of stand.— Because of irregularly shaped and imperfectly germinating seed, mechanical imperfections of the planter, unfavorable seedbed, rodent and worm damage, injuries during tillage, and other causes, it is impossible to acquire an absolutely uniform distribution of plants in the held under farm conditions. Comparative tests have been made during a 14-year period, 1915-17, 1920-29, and 1931, to determine the effects of such stand irregularities upon yield. Although the number of plants per acre remained constant in all of these tests, namely, 10,668 plants the number in consecutive hills differed. A uniform distribution of 3 plants per hill was regarded as a perfect stand and served as a basis for com - parison. As an average for the 14-year period (Table 5), the yield of the TABLE 5. — The relation of uniformity of stand to the yield of corn, H-year average, 1915-17, 1920-29, and 1931.

            <seg id="p013">Cultural Practices in Corn Production uniform stand was 49.9 bushels per acre. Alternating hills with 2 and 4 plants yielded 50.6 bushels. Alternating hills of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 plants yielded 50.0 bushels and alternating hills of 1, 3, and 5 plants yielded at the rate of 49.3 bushels. The average yield from the three ununiform stands was 50.0 bushels or 0.1 bushel more than that from a uniform stand of 3 plants per hill. The yield of the least uniform stand was 0.6 bushel per acre less than from the uniform stand. Although it is evident from these tests that there may be considerable variation in the uniformity of a stand of corn without materially affecting the yield, this should not be interpreted as endorsing careless seed selection and planting methods. It is good farm practice to strive toward reasonable uniformity of stand. This causes the land to be fully occupied and to some extent facilitates husking. CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF SEED CORN Considerable interest has developed in recent years concerning the possible benefits of treating seed corn with some organic mercury disin - fectant for the purpose of reducing seedling diseases. Such tests have been made on the Experiment Station farm with representative samples of farm - selected seed. Both treated and untreated samples of seed that had been obtained from a number of farmers were tested during the five years 1925 - 29. The results are reported in Table 6. Table 6. — Effect of treating farm-selected seed corn 1 with one or more of the standard commercial organic mercury seed disinfectants, upon the field stand, and yield per acre.

As an average for the period, the untreated seed gave a stand of 85 per cent and yielded 34.2 bushels per acre compared with 85 per cent stand and yield of 33.7 bushels for the treated seed. Thus the seed treatment neither improved the stand nor increased the yield. This is evidence that the Nebraska climatic conditions are not conducive to the serious develop - ment of seedling diseases. These results have been confirmed by outlying farmers and by experiments under western-Nebraska conditions at the North Platte Substation, reported by Zook and Jodon. 3 The commercial 3 L. L.

            <seg id="p014">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 293 disinfectants which have been tested include Uspulun, Semesan, Semesan Junior, Bayer Dust, Merko, Plant Aide, and Barbak. It has been concluded that seed corn grown in Nebraska and selected by ordinary farm methods is not materially benefited by chemical treat - ment, and such treatment is not recommended as a general practice in this state. In picking seed ears, attention should be given to apparent adapta - tion, maturity, freedom from cold injury, absence of mold, and viability. CULTIVATION AND ROOT PRUNING Timely and efficient cultivation of the growing crop has been found essential to profitable corn yields. The manner and frequency of such tillage may, however, vary with local conditions. Table 7 summarizes an 11-year test designed to develop the principles of cultivation. These tests, which were surface-planted at the rate of 3 plants per hill, may be described as follows: (1) No cultivation. The plats were left untouched after planting and weeds were allowed to grow. (2) Normal cultivation. This consisted of ordinary cultivation with a standard six-shovel cultivator, approximating 5 inches deep 9 inches from the plants. This kind of cultivation was performed 1, 2, 3, and 4 times, respectively, on different plats as indicated in the table. (3) Continued late cultivation. This involved four normal cultivations followed by one or two additional cultivations with a one-horse cultivator. (4) Scraped. The plats were not cultivated but the surface of the ground was merely scraped with a garden hoe at necessary intervals to control weeds. (5) Surface cultivation. Given four times with a cultivator having flat, blade - type shovels. (6) Shallow cultivation. (Four inches deep 9 inches from the plants.) (7) Deep cultivation. (Six inches deep 9 inches from the plants.) (8) Close cultivation. (Five inches deep 7 inches from the plants.) (9) Two harrowings followed by two cultivations. The effects of weeds, cultivation, and cropping to corn upon the supply of soil moisture and nitrates at various times during the crop season have been previously reported for a 6-year period in Nebr. Exp. Sta. Bui. 232. It was concluded that the corn crop dried the soil to approximately the same degree regardless of the type of tillage. On corresponding uncropped, fallowed land, however, normal cultivation was more effective in soil - moisture conservation and accumulation of available nitrates than was mere surface scraping to control weeds. This suggests that such beneficial soil effects resulting from cultivation should aid a corn crop growing upon the land. Frequency of cultivation. — The average yields during the 11-year period of the plats given 2, 3, and 4 normal cultivations with a standard 6-shovel cultivator were 31.5, 33.2, and 34.0 bushels per acre, respectively. In com - parison a plat receiving continued late cultivation yielded 33.4 bushels per acre. During a 6-year period, plats receiving no cultivation and one culti - vation yielded but 19 and 58 per cent, respectively, as much as those receiv - ing 4 normal cultivations. </seg>

These data indicate that weed control is the main consideration in corn cultivation. The plat without cultivation was overrun with weed growth, whieh resulted in low grain yields each year. The yields of grain increased materially as the number of cultivations was increased up to the number necessary for thorough weed control. The problem of weed control will vary, however, from year to year, depending on weather and soil conditions and the efficiency of the cultivations. In these experiments four cultivations seemed fully effective most seasons and in certain seasons two and three cultivations were practically as effective as four. Continued cultivation with a one-horse cultivator after the "laying by" of corn did not materially increase the yield in a single year and as an ] 1-year average yielded 0.6 bushel per acre less than the 4 normal culti - vations. Some benefit might be expected, however, should there be con - siderable weed growth following the last normal cultivation. These data </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 293 suggest indirectly that continued late cultivation does not result in addi - tional conservation of soil moisture as has often been assumed. There was no consistent or material change in ratio of grain to stover, stalk height, suckering, lodging, and barrenness with increase in the num - ber of cultivations from 2 to 4. Weed growth in the non-cultivated area and in the plats receiving one cultivation resulted not only in a lower acre yield of fodder but also in a very marked lowering of the grain-stover ratio, shorter stalks, fewer suckers per 100 plants, and a marked increase in barren stalks. Manner of cultivation. — In comparison with the average yield of 34.0 bushels per acre resulting from four normal cultivations at a medium depth, the plats that were merely scraped to control weed growth without actual stirring of the soil yielded 29.7 bushels, while the shallow, deep, and close cultivations yielded 32.9, 35.2, and 34.5 bushels per acre, respectively. During a four-year period four surface cultivations with a blade type of shovel yielded 4 per cent less than four normal cultivations. It appears from these data that some tillage in addition to the mere control of weed growth is advantageous. This may be due in part to reduction in the amount of run-off water. The increases of 1.1 and 2.3 bushels per acre from medium and deep cultivation respectively over shallow cultivation indicate that medium to deep cultivation, as done with a 6-shoveI culti - vator, is a satisfactory practice. Cultivation as close as possible without destroying the plant yielded practically the same as a medium or normal distance but required greater exertion and care on the part of the operator. Deep cultivation in one direction only as done in these tests with a 6-shovel cultivator did not seem injurious to the plant in any respect, as measured by yield. With the exception of slight increases in the amount of suckering in the scraped plats, barrenness in these and the shallow-cultivated plats, and lodging on the close- and late-cultivated plats, there appeared to be no relation between the manner of cultivation and the vegetative development. Effect of root pruning on development of the corn plant.— It is com - monly believed that extremely deep or close tillage, especially after the plant has obtained considerable size, may result in material loss through excessive injury from root pruning. Even though the foregoing tillage experiments indicate that there may be considerable latitude in the adjust - ment of the cultivator with respect to closeness to the plants and depth of cultivation, it seemed desirable to determine more definitely in supple - mentary tests what effect different degrees of root pruning might have upon plant development. Whereas the cultivation in the above tests was all in one direction, these prunings completely circumscribed the plants During two years, 1931 and 1932, uniform areas of corn planted to 2 - plant hills spaced 3.5 feet apart were utilized in such studies The roots surrounding the hills were cut at specified depths and distances by means ot flattened, straight-edge spades. Except in the case of the untreated plats </seg>

As calculated from the deviation-from-the-mean method, average differences of 370 pounds of stover and 7.46 bushels grain are required for statistical significance. : The spacings and depths for the successive prunings were as indicated in columns 2 and 8. prunings were made at three intervals corresponding in time with three normal cultivations given to adjacent corn. Scraping of the soil surface was substituted for cultivation to control weed growth. Any differences in plant development can thus be attributed to the specific root pruning given. The comparative root growths 4 of typical Experiment Station corn plants 2, 4, and 6 weeks after planting are shown in Figure 1 and at maturity in Figure 2. Corn is normally cultivated at about these first three stages of development in a tillage program that calls for only three culti - vations. In this experiment the results of 10 different pruning treatments were studied in comparison with no pruning. The test was replicated 10 times both years. The plant measurements and yields were based on the four interior hills of plats which were four hills square. Six treatments con - sisted of prunings 4, 7,' and 10 inches from the hill at the depths of 2.5 and 6 inches on three successive dates. Four treatments involved these same spacings and depths, but in different combinations for the successive prunings. The results are summarized in Table 8. * Acknowledgment is made for the assistance of R. M. Weihing in these root investigations. </seg>

            <seg id="p020">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 293 Although the data are not altogether consistent, a number of rather definite conclusions may be drawn. (1) Cutting the roots to a depth of 2.5 inches at a distance of four or more inches from the hills had no injurious effects on plant development. (2) Cutting three times to a depth of 6 inches at distances of 4 and 7 inches from the hill lowered the yields 20 and 12 per cent, respectively. The yield of stover as well as grain was materially reduced, and the plants were shorter, with a slight tendency for delayed maturity. Pruning 6 inches deep three times at a distance of 10 inches was of doubtful effect. (3) Pruning at a distance of 7 inches to a depth of 2.5 inches for the first two treatments and 6 inches for the third treatment, reduced the mature plant development and yield the same as did the three successive prunings to a depth of 6 inches. (4) When a corresponding 6-inch pruning at a distance of 7 inches was given at the time of a second cultivation, the harmful effect was somewhat less than when given at time of third cultivation. Similar pruning 4 inches from the plant at time of first cultivation or 10 inches from the plant at time of third cultivation resulted in no serious injury. Evidently it is deep pruning close to the plant late in the season that does the severe damage. Root studies have shown that many of the first-formed secondary roots extend laterally for considerable distances before turning downward (Figs. 1 and 2). The extent and depth of this lateral development may vary materially with soil conditions. In most instances these lateral roots would not be severely injured by normal cultivation. When they are cut, one or more long branches generally develop from near the cut end and replace the severed portion. The likelihood of complete recovery from the injury decreases with delay in the date of its occurrence. Numerous long, shallow root branches normally develop close to the soil surface after corn is "laid by". It would appear that whatever root injury accompanies normal cultiva - tion is not likely to prove harmful. Shovels that do not penetrate deeper than 4 or 5 inches and do not come within 9 inches of the plant at their deepest point will do little if any permanent injury under Nebraska condi - tions. The possibility of serious injury increases with the severity of culti - vation and under conditions which favor a very shallow, lateral growth of the secondary root system. [10M] </seg>
