            <seg id="p009">STATE OF NEBRASKA OFFICE OF THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Lincoln, Nebraska, April 27. 1932 To the Governor of Nebraska: Herewith the Nebraska State Railway Commission submits its 1931 Annual Report. The nature and scope of our work and the statistical data required by- law are included. As you know, this Commission has jurisdiction over twenty-five separate common carrier and public utility . activities, and in addition thereto is charged with the responsibilty of appearing on behalf of the state of Nebraska In matters before the In - . terstate Commerce Commission which affect Nebraska rates. As the report shows, the year 1931 found cases before the Interstate Commerce Commission involving rates to and from Nebraska points ' upon our major commodities in a greater number than ever before. Add to this, the reduction in grain rates ordered by this Commission was reversed. by the United States Supreme Court and a rehearing ordered. Needless to say these circumstances placed upon the activities of the Commission an importance and urgency of great magnitude. The saving and spending of millions of dollars in freight rates by Nebraska citizens depends upon the success of this Commission in rate cases tried during 1931 and 1932. We are confident that savings far in excess of the total cost of. this department will result. We base our confidence upon our labor performed in these cases and upon the fact that the Nebraska Commission has in the past obtained more beneficial freight rates for this state than has been obtained by any of our sister states, which i resulted in savings to the people of this state of millions of dollars. During 1931, the rail carriers in Nebraska suffered loss in revenue • due to the increase of motor vehicle competition and because of the world wide depression. The Nebraska Commission took the position that of the two alternatives (increased rates or decreased expense), the latter must be adopted in Nebraska to best serve the interests of all our people. $1,391,998.00 in overhead expenses of the carriers were cut off by orders of this Commission. Respectfully submitted, . • C. A. RANDALL, Chairman JOHN H. MILLER, Commissioner HUGH DRAKE, Commissioner Attest: * ■ J. F. MILLER, Secretary (SEAL) </seg>

COMPARATIVE STATEMENT Comparative statement of complaints and applications . covering the period from December 31, 1927, to December 31, 1931, inclusive: 1927 . 1928 1929 1930 1931 Formal Complaints: Filed 15 .42 21 27 30 Disposed of 20 ' 26 23 26 33 Informal Complaints: Filed 258 197 144 168 154 Disposed of 254 182 118 200 . 166 Applications: Filed 502 512 565 567 666 Disposed of 503 546 579 588 656 BUS COMPANIES Resolution 102, which prescribes general rules governing motor trans - portation companies, was revised by the issuance of Supplement No. 4 thereto during the year 1931 to keep it abreast with present day con - ditions. . </seg>
            <seg id="p015">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION As a result of said revision liability and property insurance on cars having a carrying capacity of seven or less was reduced from $20,000 for one accident to $10,000, and motor transportation companies are required to post up-to-date time tables in each of their stations. Other changes in general phraseology in Resolution 102 were made to clarify the purpose and meaning of the act and thus remove apparent ambiguities. ... At the end of the year 1931, twenty-seven motor transportation com - panies were operating various bus lines in the- state. Three of the companies were operated by steam railroads, or their subsidiaries, and the remaining companies by individuals or small corporations. The total route miles covered by the various companies in the state were 4,400. During 1931, twenty-lour original applications were filed requesting authority to operate bus lines in this state. Fourteen original orders were issued granting the establishment of new lines, eight applications were dismissed for lack of prosecution and two are pending. Sixty-seven supplimental orders were issued to application* which had been pievi - ously granted by the Commission. ' A great majority of these applica - tions changed the schedules and service. The three larger companies in the state, namely the Interstate Transit Lines, Burlington Trans - portation Company and the Pickwick-Greyhound Lines reduced their local service quite an appreciable extent because of a falling off in local business. However, the long haul traffic of these companies compared very- i ayof ably with the traffic for the year 1930. In general, it might be said that the bus business in Nebraska suffered along with all other businesses during the year 1931, but it did not suffer as greatly as did the railroads. TAXI-CABS r On June 5, 1931, the Supreme Court of the state of Nebraska made final decision in the case of Peterson v. Beal et al. and by reason of this decision the Commission's jurisdiction of taxi-cab companies was more clearly defined. (See Part III, page 206, this report.) Subsequent to this decision the Commission on July 20, 1931, issued Supplement No. 1 to Resolution No. 1J0 (See Part II, page" 197, this report), and revised its original rules so that they conformed with the law as in - terpreted'by the above decision. Concerted efforts were made by the Commission to enforce the law, and the following results were obtained: On December 31, 1931, eighty - two companies and Individuals had filed Insurance with this Commission covering the operation of various taxi-cabs in several towns in the state. . The .majority of these companies were located in Omaha and Lincoln, but policies covering taxi-cab operations in some seventeen </seg>
            <seg id="p016">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT other towns were also placed on file.- The total insurance represented by these policies is as follows: Insurance covering injury to one person $410,000.00 Insurance covering injury to more than one person, one accident , : ..$820,000.00 Insurance covering property damage, one accident $ 82,000.00 AIRCRAFT, PILOTS AND MECHANICS Pursuant to a law passed in 1929, one hundred and twenty aircraft pilots had filed certified copies of their Federal pilots license with the Commission. These licenses, were classified as follows: Seventy trans - port, fifteen limited commercial and thirty-five private. There had also been filed eighty-one certified copies of Federal aircraft licenses and twenty-eight certified copies of Federal mechanics license.

PUBLIC GRAIN WAREHOUSES The legislature of 1931 passed a law returning jurisdiction over pub - lic grain warehouses to the State Railway Commission. The duty of licensing and supervising public grain warehouses had been vested in the Commission from 1915 until 1930, when jurisdiction was transferred to the Department of Agriculture by an extraordinary session of the legislature. On August 2, 1931. the new grain warehouse law became effective. From that time until December 31. 1931, bonds amounting to $3,432,000 were" filed by companies which desired to conduct public grain ware - houses. In addition to the companies furnishing bonds a considerable number of cooperative companies, which store gTain for members or stockholders only, applied for a license. The grain warehouse law spe - cifically exempts this class of companies from furnishing bond. Monthly reports of grain in storage are filed by all licensed grain warehousemen, which are very carefully checked in order that those who store grain may be fully protected against loss. Because of drought conditions during the summer of 1931. not as much grain j?s usual was offered for storpge. With the customary large yield of grain for which Nebraska is noted, many more elevators will, no doubt, take advantage of the new grain warehouse law. </seg>

Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp;. Omaha Railway Company, land .Chicago and North Western Railway Company, Defendants. COMMISSIONER DRAKE PRESIDING BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING Pursuant to notice previously given, this matter came on for hear - ing September 30, 1930, at the offices of ■ the Commission at Lincoln. Complainant, the Platte Sand &amp; Gravel Company, is a corporation or - ganized and existing under and by virtue' of the laws of the state of Nebraska, with offices at Fremont, and operating a sand and gravel pit at Manska, a point located on the rails of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R., about six and one-half miles south of Fremont. By complaint, filed Juno 20, 1930, it alleges that during May, 1930, numerous carload lots of road gravel were shipped from. Manska, via the line of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. (hereinafter called the Burlington) to Omaha, for ultimate delivery to the Douglas County Board of Supervisors on the Metropolitan Water District track located on the line of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Ry. (herein - after called the M. &amp; O.), a point within the Omaha switching district designated in the tariffs of that company as Florence; that on 21 car - loads, the Burlington collected freight charges based upon a joint line sand and gravel rate of five cents per 100 pounds, which charges were prepaid by the complainant; that at the time these shipments moved the Burlington had . published and there was in effect a rate of three cents per 100 pounds, applicable from Manska to the Metropolitan Water District (Florence) and to the Metropolitan Water District station (Florence) ; that the freight charges and freight rate's so assessed, col - lected and exacted by the defendants are unjust, unreasonable, exces - sive and extortionate, in violation of the Railway Commission Act .md also in violation of the provisions 'of Section 14, prohibiting unjust dis - crimination, undue preference and the charging of higher rate for 3hort hauls than are simultaneously collected for longer hauls over the same line or route; that 26 carloads of road gravel were loaded and shipped by complainant via the Burlington to Fremont and the C &amp; N. W. Ry and M. &amp; O, to Florence, upon which the complainant paid and bore the freight charges based upon a rate of 4% cents per 100 pounds; that the defendants are. now attempting to collect additional charges based upon a 7V6 cent rate per 100 pounds, which complainant has refused to pay upon the grounds that the- charges Bought to be collected are in «xcess of the lawfully applicable rates and further that such rates and </seg>
            <seg id="p036">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT charges would be unjust, unreasonable, extortionate and unjustly dis - criminatory. Complainant prays that the Burlington be required to pay on the 24 carloads moving to Florence via Omaha over its rails, by way of reparation, the difference between the charges originally as - sessed and what they would be under the three-cent rate, also that the defendants be required to waive the collection of the so-called under - charges on the shipments moving via the Burlington to Fremont, thence the C. &amp; N. W. Ry., and M. &amp; O. to Florence. Briefs and reply briefs have been submitted. At the time this matter came on for hearing, defendants agreed that the 4% cent rate assessed on the shipments moving via Fremont to Florence should be protected; that the lines of the C. &amp; N. W. and M. &amp; O. should be considered as one line which would automatically act to estab - lish a joint line, rate of 4% cents per 100 pounds on sand and gravel from Manska to Florence, when moving via Fremont. The agreement or stipulation serves to dispose of the one part of the complaint, in - volving the movement to Florence via Fremont. Nothing more will be said with reference to this part of the complaint, except to enter the order, and we will deal only with that part involving movement via the Burlington to Omaha, thence to Florence. In support of its position, complainant relies upon the legal tariffs in effect together with the following facts: That the track upon which the 24 carloads of gravel were unloaded is known as the Metropolitan Water District station, a team track located on the right-of-way and belonging to the M. &amp; O.; that the testimony of Witness Long indi - cates that this team track or the track known as the Metropolitan Water District station (Florence) , is not owned or maintained by the Metropolitan Utilities district; that the main line switching connection' to this track is intermediate to the main line switching connection of the track serving the Metropolitan Utilities District which switch connection is north and east of this team track; that on a haul from Omaha, the M. &amp; O. engines are compelled to move cars beyond the main line switch connection of this team track or Metropolitan Water District station track, to make deliveries of coal, iron pipe and other materials to the Utility Power plant; that on. such a movement the switching charge of $6.30 per car, assessed by the M. &amp; O. Is absorbed by the Burlington, whereas the Burlington refuses to absorb said switching charge on the gravel originating on its line at Manska, consigned to Omaha and moved in the same identical kind of service- to the Metro - politan Water District station track; that this piece of track parallels the property of the Metropolitan Water District, separated by an iron fence about 5% feet high, lying about 25 feet to the east; that this team track is between 2000 and 3000 feet in length, capable of holding from 60 to 70 cars at a time; that there is also another switch con - nection off of this team track to the south, owned by the Metropolitan </seg>
            <seg id="p037">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Water district and serving what is known as the Alum plant; that this team track", or Metropolitan Water District station track is also used by the Florence Ice &amp; Coal Company, the Florence Lumber &amp; Coal Co., for the unloading of lumber, cement and other commodities outside of coal and sand, coal and sand being unloaded into bins of the one com - pany located on another spur lying west of the Metropolitan Water District station track, and into the bins of the other company hav'ng both bins and sheds .to the south, on this same Metropolitan Water District station track; that these two companies have no buildings or unloading facilities on this track outside of the bins and coal sheds of the one company, but must unload direct from the cars to the trucks or wagons, which vehicles enter upon the right-of-way of the M.'&amp; O. between this track and the property of the Metropolitan Water District; that the roadway to this piece of track can be entered from street crossings at two different places; .that on all shipments con - signed to the Florence Ice &amp; Coal Co., the Florence Lumber &amp; Coal Co., the Metropolitan Water District (Florence) and the Metropolitan Water District Station (Florence) the switching charge of $6.30 per caT is absorbed; that the M. &amp; O. in 1923 filed an application with this Commission for authority to establish on this team track, or Metro - politan Water District station track, an industry known as the National Construction Co., which authority granted under Application No. 5036 (Exhibit No. F&gt;) had the effect of establishing a switching rate of $6.30 per- car on- traffic moving to this track when consigned to the National Construction Company, subject to the same absorptions applicable to other industries at Florence; that alth'o this company was listed .as an industry it had no buildings located at Florence but used the ttnm tracks or the Metropolitan Water District station, track for a paving outfit; that as soon as the work the construction company was then engaged upon was completed, the M. &amp; O: filed an application to cancel it out as an industry, which request was granted by this Commission .(Exhibit No. 6); that Mr. Baldwin, president of the sand and gravel company, sought to secure permission from the officers of the M &amp; O. •for authority to. have the switching tariff amended in the same manner providing for the location of an industry, on this same team track or the Metropolitan Water District station track, and subject to the same conditions enjoyed by -the National Construction Company, to be kr.own as the Douglas County Board of Supervisors, indicating that sand for roa'I construction was to be unloaded In the same manner In which the materials' of the National Construction Company were unloaded, which request was refused by the M. &amp; O.: that Exhibit No. 1. a porlion of a tariff of the Burlington, shows a rate of three cents per 100 pounds on sand moved . from Fremont to Omaha: that this same rate is in effect in the present tariff CB&amp;Q GFO 16380-A: that under the inter - mediate application this rate would also apply from Manska to Omaha; Exhibit No. 2 is a copy of the M. &amp; O- switching tariff verified with </seg>

When changes . occur at industries using certain industry tracks, the issue will be corrected as soon as practicable, but until such correction is made the same rates will apply as for the industries previously using the same track; that on shipments from connecting lines consigned to the National Construction Company, using the team track or Metro - politan Water District Station track, the switching charge of $6.30 was absorbed by connecting line carriers; that the Douglas County Board of Supervisors should have the same switching rate by. reason of the fact that It was located on the same industry track used by the Na - tional Construction Company; that altho Florence is listed as a station in the tariffs of the M. &amp; O. it has switching rates to industries located at that point and is in the same position as.Ralston on the Burlington, which point is indicated as a station in the tariffs of the Burlington, and has switching rates to industries at that point; that Seymour Park and Lawn on the Missouri Pacific, Gibson on the Union Pacific, and South Omaha on nearly all roads are similarly situated within the Omaha switching limits with interchange switching rates which- are absorbed by other lines; that the tariffs of the Burlington (Exhibits 3 and 4) carry the absorption rules covering connecting lines switching charges at Omaha, and as no exceptions are shown on traffic destined to Flor - ence, they are compelled to absorb the switching charges of the M. &amp; O. from Omaha to Florence. Complainant cites the following condi - tions surrounding switching charges at other points in Nebraska: At Fremont, the Union Pacific publishes an interchange switching rate from Sandell to Fremont, subject to absorption by other lines. Sandell Is listed as a station on the Union Pacific. At Superior, the Missouri Pacific names an interchange switching rate 'on sand and gravel from Keithley Spur, which rate is absorbed by the Burlington and the C. &amp; N. W. At Northport the Burlington publishes an interchange switching rate of $9.00 per car, which charge is absorbed by the Union Pacific Railroad. At Louisville, the Burlington has an interchange switching charge which is absorbed by the Missouri Pacific and Rock Island. That on all such sand and gravel shipments the single line rates apply. Complainant also points out the fact that the M..&amp; O. was a party to this complaint but did not appear or present testimony dealing with the conditions surrounding the movement of traffic to or from the sta - tion of Florence, nor did they produce any witnesses to give full in- </seg>
            <seg id="p039">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION formation regarding the names of various tracks or industries located at Florence. Neither did. they produce any witness to give an inter - pretation of their switching tariff. Defendant '(Burlington) took the position that the movement in question was a station to station movement with each station on a different road and that the joint line haul rates should apply, based on the distance from (Woodcliffe) Manska to Omaha to Florence; that Florence is a regular station and so indicated in the list of stations issued by the M. &amp; O-; that Florence is shown as a station in G.O. No. 19 (a publication issued by this Commission), and is also shown as a station in the distance table of the M. &amp; O. It seems to be the posi - tion of the defendant that you cannot apply a road haul rate in one in - stance and a switching rate in another in connection with a station to station movement as set forth by the testimony of Witness Driggs at Record 78%. "Q. (By Mr. Powell) I don't get your point of view, Mr. Driggs, from your statement in regard to stations that are a part of a larger station, also being named in the table of distances. Is It your contention, when they are named In the table of dis - tances, they are taken out of their application as to switching terminals or district, within the larger terminal? A. It is my contention this station of Florence is a regular station so indicated in the station list issued by this railroad their tariffs read between Omaha and Florence and put them in as proof, or as an exhibit. And this Commission shows Florence • in General Order No. 19, as a station. . Q.. By reason of that fact it must not be considered as a part of the Omaha switching district,. is that your contention? . ' A. I don't believe it can be a switching proposition in one place and a road haul in another;" That this Commission issued an order requiring the carriers to estab - lish joint line rates for the movement of sand and gravel from stations on one road to stations on another road; that this joint line tariff pro - vided a rate of 5% cents per 100 pounds to Florence, a joint line haul of 61.5 miles, it being 56.4 miles from Woodcliffe to Omaha and 5.1 miles Omaha to Florence (Woodcliffe being the first station beyond . Manska from which distances are shown) ; that as a matter of fact the cars involved "in this complaint were undercharged one-half : cent per 100 pounds, based on the joint distance rate via Ashland; that !f the distance could be figured via the Chalco cutoff the through rate would be 4% cents or an overcharge of one-half-cent per 100 pounds; that because these shipments were delivered to a consignee who did not have an industrial location' at Florence, the joint line rate would be the only rate to apply in order to get delivery on the team track of the M. &amp; O. at Florence; admits that It the sand and gravel originat - ing on the Burlington were consigned to the Metropolitan Utilities </seg>
            <seg id="p040">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT District or the Horence Lumber &amp; Coal Co. the single line rate of three cents would apply and the $6.30 per car interchange switching charge of the M. &amp; O. would have to. be absorbed by the Burlington; that team tracks of a carrier ordinarily are not open to connecting lines; that the gravel moved in the instant case was to the Douglas County Board of Supervisors and had to be placed on the team tracks in order 10 make delivery; that they were not listed as an industry in the switch - ing tariff of the M- &amp; O. and would not, therefore, be entitled to have a switching rate of $6.30 per car subject to absorption; that there is no violation of the long and short haul provision of the statute; that the Metropolitan Utilities District is a department of the government of the City of Omaha in whose favor the carriers have the right to discriminate under the statute if there is any discrimination. Defend - ant shows that the aggregate charges on the shipments involved should be $1,342.76 under the 5%-cent rate, and $732.40 under the three-cent rate; that if they are required to absorb the switching charges of $6.30 per car, the amount of the absorption will be $144.90, leaving a net amount accruing to the defendant under the three-cent rate of $587.50; that under the joint line rate of 5% cents defendant (the Burlington) would receive J939.93 and the M. &amp; O. $402.83. based on a division of 70% to the originating line and 30% to the destlnating line. These figures are based upon the movement of 23 cars. The testimony shows, however, thrt 24 cars. were moved and usin^ 24 cars as a basis we arrive at the following figures: Aggregate charges based on a 5%-cent rate $1,395.83; based on a 4V£-cents rate $1,142.01; based on a three-cent rate $761.34; based. on a five-cent rate $1,268.91, which is the actual amount collected by defendant. On 24 cars, the amount of the absorption based on $6.30 per car would be $151.20, leav - ing under the three-cent rate a net amount of $610.14 accruing to the originating carrier, or an average revenue of $25.42 per car. From the evidence of Witness Driggs and assuming a hypothetical case, we would arrive at the following results — that if these 24- cars of gravel had moved to the Metropolitan Utilities District or the Florence Lumber &amp; Coal Company, under the tariffs legally in effect. It would have been proper for the Burlington to have absorbed $151.20 out of a total of $761-34, leaving them a net revenue of $610.14, but inasmuch as they were consigned to the Douglas County Board of Supervisors and It was necessary to place these cars on the team track the proper charges should have been (using the 4',4-cent rate) $1,142.01, which amount the complainant would have to pay. In other words, the complainant would have paid $1,142.01, and -on a movement to the ■ Metropolitan Utilities District, or the Florence Lumber &amp; Coal Company, a shipper would pay but $761.34, or $380.67 less than the complainant would pay for the same kind of service. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION CONCLUSIONS Based upon the evidence of record in this case, we arrive at the following conclusions: I. .'.- That while Rule 7 of M. &amp; O. Switching Tariff 3300-J seems to op - erate to restrict the switching of cars to M. &amp; 0. tracks for the parties owning or operating industries. Rule 10 is a modification of that rule and acts to hold out to. a shipper an additional privilege, in that it extends to such a shipper the same protection granted to another in - dustry previously using the same track. II. That in this case the M. &amp; O. should have amended Its switching tariff to include the Douglas County Board of Commissioners as an in - dustry at Florence, by reason of the fact that they were using the same track previously, used by the National Construction Company and which is being used at the present time by various other industries located at Florence, some of which have no buildings, or other loading or un - loading facilities, on this Metropolitan Water District track, or team track, located on the property of the M. &amp; O. and maintained by that company. .!- III. That the interchange switching charge of $6.30 per car applies to all industries now located at Florence, including the Metropolitan Util - ities District power plant, indicating that no special privileges have been granted this branch of the government of the city of Omaha. IV. That the movement herein involved to the team track of the Metro - politan Water District station (Florence) was intermediate to a move - ment for a" point beyond, namely the Metropolitan Utilities District, and under the long and short haul clause of the act the rate should not exceed the rate to the more distant point, namely the Metropolitan Water District power plant. V. . That while we have held in previous cases that the team tracks of a carrier could not be opened for the indiscriminate use ot competing lines, we agreed with, and followed to some extent, the rulings of the Interstate Commerce Commission relating to this situation. The Inter - state Commerce Act, under Section 3, provided that same should "not be construed as requiring any such common carrier to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities to another carrier engaged In like busi - ness". The act creating this Commission, and the laws governing, make no mention as to the use of the tracks of connecting lines for the use of </seg>
            <seg id="p042">TWENTY'-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT another carrier engaged in the same business. In 1920, the Interstate Commerce Transportation Act was amended with the above proviso omitted and a paragraph Inserted in Section 3 under which the Interstate Commerce Commission might require the use of one carrier's terminal facilities by another when in the public Interest, where It is practicable and does not substantially impair the ability of the terminal carrier to handle its own business, and in I. &amp; S. Docket No. 1530, Team Track Switching to Argentine, Kansas, 73 I. C. C. 367, the Interstate Com - merce Commission held that the team tracks of one carrier should be open to other connecting lines and that interchange switching charges should be assessed on such movements. We are inclined to agree with this position of the Interstate Commerce Commission in so far as the opening of team tracks is concerned and from the evidence submitted find that there would be no congestion at the terminal in Florence and hence there appears to be no reason why this track, regardless of other factors, should not have been opened for delivery of shipments consigned to the Douglas County Board of Supervisors. We have permitted the M. &amp; O. under our Application No. 5036, to establish the National Con - struction Company as an industry on this Metropolitan Water District track or, as we understand it, the team track at Florence. •VI. That the legal rate on sand and gravel from Manska, Nebraska, to Omaha. Nebraska, is three cents per. 100 pounds. VII. That the interchange switching charge of $6.30 per car to Florence from Omaha should be assessed on the shipments consigned to the Douglas County Board of Supervisors at .Florence and absorbed by the Burlington. VIII. That complainant paid and bore the freight charges on the ship - ments involved and is entitled to reparation in the sum of $507.57, which sum represents the difference In the amount paid based on an aggre - gate weight of 2,537,820 pounds at five cents per 100 pounds and what the charges would be based on a rate of three cents per 100 pounds. An appropriate order will be entered in conformity with the con - clusions.

            <seg id="p044">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 674 Farmers Cooperative Grain Ass'n., Walthill, Nebraska, Complainant, v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant. CHAIRMAN RANDALL PRESIDING BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING The Farmers Cooperative Grain Association of Walthill alleges in its complaint that it is an incorporated cooperative grain association, organized for the purpose, among other things, of handling grain for its members and others; that about December 6, 1929, the Chicago, Bur - lington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company granted complainant a permit, for the shipping season 1929-1930, to operate, on its right of way at Walthill, a blower grain loader mounted on a tractor, a device for the loading of grain from wagons or trucks into railroad cars; that complainant agreed to hold the railroad company harmless from loss and damage by reason of any negligent operation of such device; that- it used the loader in handling the grain of its members in full compliance with all the terms of the permit; that in October, 1930, it applied for an ex - tension of the permit, which was refused, and that the railroad com - pany now forbids complainant to .use the loader. During the shipping season of 1929-1930 complainant shipped 124 cars of grain, received from its members, over defendant's railroad. The complainant prays that the defendant be required to permit the complainant to use the blower loader -in loading its members' grain into defendant's cars. The answer admits the corporate organization of the complainant, its purpose of handling grain for its members and others, the granting of a permit to operate the blower loader during the 1929 crop season, but states that the loader was to be used solely in the handling of grain raised by members of the association during that season, and that it has refused to renew the permit. It alleges upon information and belief that the ' complainant, by the use of the blower loader, loaded grain that was not raised by members of the association. It also, alleges that additional hazard was created by the movement, installation, operation and presence of the blower loader over the hazard of an ordinary elevator outside and away from the tracks within the railroad yards: The defendant challenges the jurisdiction of the Commission, alleg - ing that defendant's tracks, side tracks, etc., are parts of its interstate railway extending through numerous states, including Nebraska; that </seg>
            <seg id="p045">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION If defendant were ordered to permit the use of the loader, defendants property would be taken without due process of law, and that such order would be repugnant to the. commerce clause of the federal constitution. A dismissal is prayed. • In its brief the defendant challenges the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission on the additional ground that the jurisdiction of this matter is vested In the district courts of this state. The evidence shows that there are but few live stock feeders In the vicinity of Walthill; about 75% of the grain In that locality being shipped out. A large number of the farmers became dissatisfied with the price they were receiving for their gr^'n ~t t'-.e c!c— '.tors and on that account organized the plaintiff corporation under the statutes pro - viding for the formation of cooperative corporations. It now has about 115 members. The authorized capital stock of the corporation is $5,000, divided into five hundred shares of $10.00 each, no person to hold more than 5% thereof. It appears that anyone who produces grain may become a member by purchasing a share of stock. Sometimes a farmer's g r ain is received before he has actually become a member on his agreement that the purchase price of his share of stock shall be deducted from the returns from his grain. In theory the board of directors must pass on the farmer's application for membership, but no one appears to be re - jected if willing to purchase a share of stock. -The association has handled the grain of its members only, except in one instance when a landlord's grain was unknowingly received with that of his tenant. The latter was a member, but the former was not. The corporation charges one and one-halt cents per bushel for receiv - ing and marketing- grain. The actual cost of handling grain, including all incidental expenses, has been approximately one and one-quarter cents per bushel. The difference, between the cost and the charge to the farmer, of approximately one-quarter cents goes into the treasury of ' the company to cover the purchase of equipment and other property, and to take care of -depreciation, etc. No endeavor is made to earn a profit. Through its membership in the Farmers West Central Grain Company the plaintiff has access to the grain exchange in Omaha. During the shipping season of 1929-1930 the company handled about 125 cars of grain, which appears to have been shipped to Omaha and sold there. The prices received were substantially more than the farm - ers could have realized had they marketed their grain at the local elevator, the general difference being from four to six cents per bushel. The elevators at Walthill have, in part, met the competition, but at present there is still a difference in favor of selling through the as - sociation} </seg>
            <seg id="p046">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT The association immediately sells, on the terminal market, the grain that it receives. It does not buy grain; but only acts as a selling agency. Its prices are fixed upon what Is being paid In the terminal market in Omaha.- The freight rate from Walthill to Omaha is seven cents per bushel, and the charge of the association is one and one-half cents. The price quoted to the farmer is, therefore, the Omaha price less eight and one-half cents. The grain going into Walthill Is delivered in wagons and trucks. It was formerly scooped from the wagons or the trucks into the rail - road cars. The association, as stated above, purchased a tractor blower loader which- it received permission to operate on the railroad right of way. Such permission has now been discontinued, which led to the institution of this proceeding. The loader is described as a 10-20 Mc- Cormick-Deering tractor with a Liberty blower attachment on the front of the tractor. The blower consists of a hopper, into which the grain is dumped, and a blower which blows it through a pipe or spout into the car. The whole apparatus — tractor, hopper- and blower — occupies a space about six feet wide by twelve or fourteen feet long on the ground. There are photographs of it in the record which show it to be about the size stated above. Its height, with the exception of the spout or pipe, appears to be about five feet. The operation of the loader by complainant has been very careful. It has been well handled and has never been allowed to remain on the right of way during the. night. There is no complaint by the railroad company concerning the opera - tion. If grain is scooped from wagons or trucks into cars it is a alow and laborious task. It takes four men about one-half a day to load a car by scooping while with the blower it can be done in. two and a half or three hours, depending in part on whether the wagons or trucks are delivering promptly. A car can be loaded by the blower loader, if grain is promptly delivered to it, as rapidly as by an elevator. Since permis - sion to use the blower was cancelled, a few cars have been loaded by scooping. Defendant carrier appears to have no objection to the individual farmer's shipping his own grain. He may scoop it into the cars, or he may use a blower. A group- of farmers, however, will not be permitted by defendant to use a blower. Mr. Montgomery, general freight agent of the defendant's lines west of the Missouri River, when asked the reason for making a distinction between one farmer and a group of farmers, answered: Q. You will make a distinction as between a group or one farmer? A. Yes; sir. for the reason the group of farmers are engaged in the selling of grain as a group in competition with elevator men, who have a comparatively large investment and are operating year in and year out, the farmers in event of a crop failure, put their loader in a shed or leave it out as they choose, and are put to no expense at all. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Q. Do you think it is proper to discriminate between one farmer or three farmers, or one hundred farmers, so long as they are load - ing their own grain?. A. I couldn't say we were discriminating. We would be dis - criminating against the elevator men If we allowed a group of men to use a faculty that means a very small Investment as against the permanently located grain dealer. * * * Q- Do you feel it incumbent upon the Burlington Railroad to 'pio - tect any individual or corporation so they may have a monopoly on a business? A. We are protecting our own business. At Walthill the con - ditions may be different, but we are desirous of having people In the grain business on our line, who are in a position to take in grain in quantities and store it. * * * Q. Mr. Montgomery, if just two farmers out in that locality wanted to ship you wouldn't object to Mr. Winget and Mr. McQuistan, you wouldn't object to that, would you. A. If one came as an individual and wanted to load his grain with his own facilities, we would hot deny him. It is not the function of the carriers to regulate the number of • persons who may engage in business, nor to select the particular indi - viduals who may do so. The use of the loader cannot diminish the amount of grain to be hauled by the carrier. It will haul the surplus grain and if the grain is stored on the farms the delivery will be better distributed than where it is stored in large warehouses. There appears to be no extra hazard arising from the use of the blower. -It shortens the time required to load a car, and in that way appears to lessen danger. It does not require as many men as are needed when grain is scooped, also reducing danger. The blower is easily moved, requiring ho greater time for its movement away from a car than it takes to shift the gears of an ordinary automobile. There would be no particular damage even if a car should be moved while loading was in progress, except that the spout might be bent or broken. The photograph, Exhibit "J", shows plainly that there Is sufficient clear - ance .between the hopper and the car, so that there would be no danger in case the car were to be unexpectedly moved. Wagons or trucks, from which grain is being transferred by the loader to a railroad car, need not be so near the car as when grain is scooped. There is nothing in the record indicating added danger by the use of the. blower. This Is also evidenced by the fact that the defendant permits an individual farmer shipping his own grain to use a blower loader. In reference to the hazard. Mr. Montgomery testified: </seg>
            <seg id="p048">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Q. Does your objection go to the matter of safety of this appliance or the fact that the operation of it interferes with the condition of the market? A. The safety condition doesn't enter into that. Q. Is It objected to by your management department, or whatever department it would come under? A. I don't recall that that feature has been made a factor in determining a matter of that kind. Q. Your objection is not on the ground of danger of operating the appliance? A. No. We find that there is no undue hazard incurred by use of the blower loader. We also find that the complainant corporation is organized for the purpose of furthering cooperative marketing a method backed by both state and federal agricultural authorities, and specifically provided for and fostered by the laws of this state. The contentions of defendant will now be considered. Its objection to the character of the complainant organization — that it is a mere subterfuge and sham under the color of cooperative aggrega - tion to transact the business of receiving and shipping all manner of grain from the station of Walthill is not supported. No evidence ol subterfuge or sham appears in the record. The subject needs no dis - cussion, however, as the answer of defendant admits the allegation of paragraph one of the complaint in which it is definitely stated that the complainant is duly incorporated under the laws of Nebraska. Further, counsel for defendant stated at the hearing that there was no claim that there was not proper incorporation. If the defendant wished to defend upon the ground of lack of proper corporate organization, it should have specifically pleaded It. Chamberlain Banking House v. Kemper, etc., D. G. Company, 3 Neb. (Unof.) 549. Next it contended that the jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter is in the district court and not in this Commission. The Equal Facilities Act, chapter 74, paragraph 501, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, is relied upon. That act provides generally for equality of treatment of shippers. It provides particularly for the procedure when there is to be construction of side track, that, is, permanent structures, either on or off the right of way. The relevant parts of the statutes are as follows: '.* » » and every railroad company or corporation owning or operating a railroad in the State of Nebraska shall afford rea - sonable and equal terms, service, facilities and accommodations to all persons and associations who are engased Or desire to engage </seg>

The use of the loader is not within the purview of the statute. The next contention is that if the defendant were to be required to permit the use of the blower Its property would be taken without due process of law. We find that the use of the blower Is safe and reason - able, that it facilitates the handling of traffic, that it increases rather than diminishes the use of defendant's right of way and that it does not result in the taking of defendant's property at all, much less In an unlawful taking. Defendant cites the following cases to sustain its position: Stacy - ville Grain &amp; Coal Co. v- Illinois Central R, R. Co., P. U. R. 1920B, 133, which was a decision by the Iowa Board of Railroad Commissioners. The case involved the rental to be charged for the ground occupied by an elevator and coal sheds standing on the railroad right of way. The Commission fixed the charge. It is not perceivable that the proceeding has any relation to the present controversy. The case was decided more </seg>
            <seg id="p051">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION than ten years ago since which time conditions have been greatly modi - fied. The changes are so well known that we must take cognizance of them. In many parts of the country grain is now raised in larger fields and means and methods of cultivation have greatly improved. Small grains are, to a considerable extent, though perhaps not in the vicinity of Walthill, harvested and threshed in one operation. Storage by the use of movable metal bins is much more readily and cheaply provided, and provided on the farm, which authorities on agriculture consider preferable to storage in warehouses, and cooperative market - ing under the fostering care of government, both federal and state, is becoming the rule. A statement in the Stacyville case, that "grain can be loaded on team track from wagons but it generally takes about two days to load a car," illustrates the difference between the old conditions and the new ones. Elevators are doubtless a necessity and will continue to be needed and to be operated. When, however, there is so marked an advantage in using a power device, such as a tractor blower loader, it should be permitted. It would be a return to the economic theories of past cen - turies to refuse permission. In some cases it may work to the disad - vantage of property owners, but that happens whenever there is an ad - vance. Railroads put stage-coaches out of business to the great damage of their owners and with consequent damage to coach manufacturers, harness makers and raisers of horses. Still no one would now Ray that because of such damage the railroad was not generally a great benefit. In Deleware, Lackawanna &amp; Western R. R. Co. v. Town of Morris - town, 276 U. S. 182, the right of a municipal corporation to establish a public hack stand on a driveway within the station grounds of a railroad company, was under consideration. The court held that a railroad com - pany was not bound to allow cabmen or others to enter upon or use any part of its buildings or grounds to wait for fares or solicit patrons. The case is not relevant to the present controversy. Here there is no ques - tion eithei of the right of persons to go upon the right of way or to load cars. There Is simply a question concerning the method of hand - ling the grain out of wagons and. trucks. Great Northern R. R. Co. v. Cahill, 253 U. S. 71, involved an order of the Board of Railroad Commissioners of South Dakota requiring the company to Install a cattle scale at one of Its stations, and Great Northern v. Minn.. 238 U. S- 340, involved a similar order of the Min - nesota Railroad and Warehouse Commission. There, is nothing in either of those cases bearing upon the present controversy. State ex rel. Railroad Commissioners v. Florida East Coast R. R. Co., 68 Southern 781, holds that a railroad company has a right to load or unload its cars where its facilities are and may not be required to establish other facilities for such purpose to accommodate each patron. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT and that a carrier is entitled to reasonable compensation for . moving freight to or from points on private or industrial side traeks. There is no demand here for additional facilities, nor is there ques - tion as to freight or switching charges. Louisville and Nashville R. R. Co. v. Central Stock. Yards Co., 212 U. S. 132, holds that the property of a railroad company is taken with - out due process of law when such company may be compelled upon payment simply for the service of carriage to receive, deliver and trans - fer cars offered to it at an arbitrary connecting point near its terminus by a competing road for the purpose of reaching and using the former's terminal facilities. There is no connection whatever between that case and the one now before us. In State ex rel. Board of Transportation v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 164 U. S. 403, commonly known as the Elmwood case, there was an attempt to require the railroad company to surrender a part of its land to private persons for the purpose of building and ' maintaining their elevator upon it. Such requirement was held to be a taking of private property of the company for the private use of such .persons; that the taking of private property of a person or of a corporation, without the owner's consent, for the private use of another violates the due process clause of the federal constitution. As pointed out above, in this case there is no taking of property whatever. A lawful and proper use is not a taking. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. State, and Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. State ex rel. Farmers Elevator Co., two cases, 217 U- S. 196, involved the power of the state to require a railroad company to construe* and maintain at its own expense, and without preliminary hearing as to necessity therefor, side tracks or switches to reach grain elevators which might be erected adjacent to the right of way. It was held that a state did not have such power.' The court referred to the later amend - ment providing for a preliminary hearing and compensation, but did not take the statute into account in deciding the case. The statute re - ferred to is a portion of the present Equal Facilities Act and it was doubtless passed on account of the holding in the Elmwood case, rupra. There is nothing similar, in either of the cases, to the questions raised in this case. It is also urged that jurisdiction of this matter is vested in the In - terstate Commerce Commission under the commerce clause of the fed - eral constitution. Doubtless tbe regulation of all terminal facilities, including team tracks of interstate carriers, might be placed under the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission, but that has not been done. The fact that a facility is used in both interstate and intrastate commerce does not mean that it Is solely under the control of the fed - eral authority. Until Congress acts, the state may act. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION This matter, however, is under the control of the state by virtue of Paragraph 22 of Section I of the Interstate Commerce Act, which reads as follows: "The authority of the Commission conferred by paragraphs (18) to (21), both inclusive, shall not extend to the construction or abandonment of spur, industrial, team, switching or side tracks, located or to be located wholly within one ■ State, or of street, suburban, or interurban electric railways, which are not operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of trans - portation." Not only has the state control of the construction or abandonment of team tracks and lother tracks mentioned in the paragraph above quoted, but it also has 'jurisdiction of the operation thereof. In Western and Atlantic R. R. Co. v- Georgia Public Service Commission, 267 U. S. 497, the Supreme Court held that an interstate carrier might not dis - continue switch track service without the consent of the state public service commission, although 85% of the business done thereon was in - terstate. It is also urged that as one of the elevator owners at Walthill has offered to handle the farmers' grain, the defendant should not be re - quired to permit the use of the blower. It Is not shown how the ele - vator would handle the grain, nor whether it would be shipped as de - sired by the owner. Further, the charge proposed by the elevator owner for handling the grain is more than twice as. high as the present cost which the farmer pays for the service. We do not consider the so-called offer as being a defense to the complaint. Under our" power of general regulation of the practices of carriers, it is our duty to require the carriers to adapt themselves to advances in methods of handling traffic. In our view the rule of the defendant that a farmer may load his grain into cars either by scooping it or by using a blower loader, but that if he associates himself with a number of other farmers in a cooperative marketing association as provided by law, he may not use such an instrumentality on the right of way, is wholly arbitrary and unreasonable. We consider it the duty of the de - fendant to permit the use of the blower loader by the plaintiff. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED, ADJUDGED AND ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the defendant, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, permit the complainant. Farm - ers Cooperative Grain Association of Walthill, to operate the tractor blower loader' described in the complaint and in the evidence, in the loading of cars of defendant, upon its team tracks at Walthill, Nebraska, with grain belonging to plaintiff and Its members. </seg>

Hamilton &amp; Sons owners Hamilton-Thedford-Brownlee Tele - phone Company, Defendants. DRAKE, COMMISSIONER: OPINION AND FINDINGS Complainant is the owner of a telephone exchange system at Thed - ford, consisting of a central office, about fifty city subscribers, about eight rural subscribers, one rural switched line with six subscribers, and also prior to the filing of this complaint, switched another rural line extending to Brownlee. The Hamilton Telephone Company is a privately owned line extend - ing from Thedford to Brownlee, serving at present eleven patrons. This company also owns another line which extends from Thedford on the same poles for about six miles, and then extends eastward for several miles, serving about nine patrons. This property was purchased by Thomas Hamilton a number of years ago, at a time when it was about to be aband - oned. Thomas Hamilton and his two sons own and operate several ranches along the line, and in order to provide themselves with service, bought the whole property. At the time of the purchase, there were thirteen patrons, including the three in his own family, several ot whom were located in the inland town of Brownlee. At that time there was a bank, garage and several stores in Brownlee. Sometime after the </seg>
            <seg id="p055">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION purchase of the line the bank failed and the largest store burned down, but a drug store and post office, garage and another store remain as patrons. The proprietor of the drug store operates a small exchange, switching several farm lines out of Brownlee. In the past a consider - able number of toll messages originated at Brownlee, although the evi - dence in this case Indicated the revenue from the toll business has de - creased a certain extent. Prior to 1925, the Hamiltons owned a small central office equip - ment in Thedford, serving about five city subscribers and this line to Brownlee. Neither the Hamiltons nor the Thedford company had a franchise in Thedford until during 1925 when each of them attempted to secure a franchise. The city council, and owners of both companies, in conferences, discussed the advisability of having more than one ex - change, and the final result was that the franchise of the Hamiltons was tabled and one was granted to the Thedford company. The testi - mony shows that the Hamiltons agreed to abandon their exchange and turn their city patrons over to the Thedford company and to accept switching service, and, in consideration of which the Thedford company agreed to switch the Hamilton line, accepting as its pay for such switch - ing service all of the toll business originating on the Hamilton line. Sometime thereafter, the Hamiltons constructed a second line on their poles for part of the distance and then built a new line out at an angle, which line serves about nine patrons, and is called the Antelope Valley. line. The, patrons on this line paid the Hamiltons • $1.25 per month, of which the Hamiltons paid the Thedford company 75c per month for switching service. The ownership and management of the Thedford company changed recently and the new owner, Mr. Flgard, decided to make some changes. Sometime just prior to December, 1930, Mr. Flgard served notice that on December 1st, he would demand a switching fee of 75c from all the patrons on the Hamilton lines. This would not affect the Antelope Valley line with the nine subscribers,, but would affect all patrons on the Brownlee line. The Hamiltons, who were collecting $1.25 per month from their patrons, solicited their patrons, all of whom refused to pay the 75c per month in addition to the monthly rate of $1.25 to the Ham - iltons. On or about December 1st, 1930, the Hamiltons cut their Brown - lee line at Thedford and established a terminal telephone in one of the stores in Thedford, which gave service on that line into the town of Thedford, but did not give service to any other points In Thedford, nor did it provide for any toll connections. Thereafter, sometime during December, 1930. the Hamiltons installed a knife switch between the Brownlee line and the Antelope Valley line. The Antelope Valley line was still being switched by the Thedford company, and by throwing the switch, all patrons on the Brownlee line could reach the Thedford </seg>
            <seg id="p056">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT exchange and connect with toll lines. . The Hamiltons, thereupon, re - quested the city council to grant them a franchise, which the record ' shows was granted, and the Hamiltons now have a franchise to operate an exchange in Thedford. J. H. Figard, as owner of the Thedford company, filed the original complaint, praying for an order, (1) requiring Hamiltons to recon - nect with his exchange, and (2) authorizing an adequate switching rate, with reasonable rules and regulations. The Hamiltons, in their answer, allege the existence of the contract above set out, and pray that such contract be enforced. Ten of the subscribers on the Brownlee line intervened with a pleading setting out that both the Hamilton line and the Thedford com - pany were common carriers, and praying for an order requiring a recon - nection of the Hamilton line with the Thedford switchboard, and ade - quate service. Nineteen subscribers of the Thedford exchange filed a petition of intervention, with the same allegations and asking for In - vestigation, rcconnection and adequate service. CONCLUSIONS - The record discloses the facts as set out above, including the ex - istence of the' contract alleged by the Hamiltons. While it is true that a court of equity might enforce this contract, this Commission must," in accordance with its regulatory powers, take other things into con - sideration. It is the opinion of this Commission that it must consider the rights of all patrons of both the Hamilton and the Thedford com - panies. There is no doubt as to both companies being common carriers. While there is some testimony touching on the service rendered by the Thedford company, the Commission does not consider there Is sufficient upon which to make a finding. There is. however, consider - able evidence concerning the Hamilton line. It appears that after ac - quisition, they rebuilt the line, moving many miles over along the high - way. The patrons, who testified, were apparently satisfied with the service. The Hamiltons testified that they owned and maintained the main pole line; that the patrons owned the instruments and leads out to the main line, and maintained their portion of the lines. They testified that their investment was about $1,600 but presented no figures as to valua - tion or condition, alleging that they made replacements whenever ncces sary and intended to replace many more' poles and install considerable new wire. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the present rate of $1.25 per month would be inadequate if the Hamiltons were forced to pay the Thedford company a reasonable switching rate out of that amount. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The Thedford company alleges that it is authorized to publish and collect a rate of 75c per month and that such rate is reasonable. This Commission, in Application No. 3841, said as follows: "Application haying been made by the Thedford Telephone ' Company .for authority to publish and collect a rate of 75 cents per month per station for switching service; and it appearing to the Commission upon investigation that applicant company has 43 telephones upon its exchange and desires the switching rate to care for six stockholders and an Independent company whose lines the Thedford company connects with three miles from the exchange limits; and it appearing further that the rate asked for hardly covers the out-of-pocket cost to the company of switching each subscriber: it was on motion directed . that the desired au - thority be granted and that applicant be notified by letter of the action taken. (Application 3841)." The record in that case shows that the application covers a special case where the company owned and maintained the line for a distance of three miles out in the country, where it connected with the switched company. It is now the opinion of the Commission that this order au - thorized a special rate, and that the circumstances and conditions sur - rounding such order are not parallel to the present case. This Commission must take into consideration the rights of all parlies concerned, which will include the Hamiltons, the Thedford company, the patrons on each of the Hamilton lines, and the patrons of the ThedTord company. While it is probable that a court of equity in de - ciding the issues presented, concerning the contract made in 1925 by and between the Hamiltons and the Thedford company, would enforce that contract, this Commission, under its powers and in accordance with its regulatory duties, need not consider such contract. (McCook Irri - gation &amp; W. P. Co. v. .Burtless, 98 Nebr. 141. Marquis v. Polk Co. Tel. Co.. 100 Nebr. 140). The Commission is of the opinion that reason - able rates should be established. It is impossible to make a definite finding as to valuation or rea - sonable return, but the Commission is of the opinion and so finds: That the Hamiltons should be granted authority to publish and collect a rate of $1.50 .per month for all their patrons; that the Thedford company should publish and collect a switching rate from the Hamiltons of 50c per month for each patron on the Hamiltons' line, which includes both ihe Brownlee line and the Antelope Valley line; that the Hami'tons should be granted a toll rate of 25c for all messages from Brownlee to Thedford or Thedford to Brownee, in all cases where either the party sending or receiving the call is not a patron of the Thedford exchange or its switched lines; and that the Hamiltons should be ordered to reconnect their Brownlee line to the Thedford exchange and remove other connections in Thedford; and to remove the knife switch now in operation; and that an emergency exists. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">•TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT It is the further opinion of the Commission that, on toll messages passing through the Thedford exchange to or from points outside of the Thedford exchange, the present customary division of revenues derived therefrom shall be maintained- ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that Thomas P.

Under these circumstances, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that T. P. Hamilton &amp; Sons should be permitted to abandon their Antelope Valley line.

Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, a corporation, Defendant. COMMISSIONER MILLER PRESIDING BY" THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING This matter came on to be heard in the offices of the Commission on the complaint of residents ot the community in and about Sterling, who are subscribers on the rural lines of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph Company which owns and operates the exchange" in this locality. They allege that the net rate per- month of $1.75 for rural metallic residence telephone service Is exorbitant, as compared with the present prices of agricultural products- . Complainants further allege that the present rates are a- violation of the Railway Commission act, and pray for a reduction. ' Complainants offered no testimony other than the allegations set forth in their petition, and the general statement/at^the time of the hearing, that the prices of farm products were extremely low and still </seg>
            <seg id="p061">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION declining, while charges of the telephone company for service have not been correspondingly reduced. Since the complainants offered no testi - mony showing the revenues and expenses of the telephone company, and the value of its property devoted to the public use in support of its complaint, the company volunteered a complete statement, showing the revenues and expenses of the Sterling exchange for the years 1926 to and including the first seven months of 1931. The defendant showed that the company has not earned operating expenses In the years referred to above. The annual losses range from $291.00 In .1930, up to $2,451.00 in the year 1929. The latter was caused by rehabilitating, the property, which is the practice of the company every three or four years. The losses for the years 1926, 1927 and 1928 were $613.00, $956.00. and $244.00 respectively, and the estimated loss for the year 1931 was approximately $400.00. The" total net earnings for the period from 1918 to and including the first seven months of 1931, or a period " of thirteen years and seven months, were $1,46696, or approximately $107.00 per year. The book value of the telephone property devoted to the public use in the exchange at Sterling was shown to be $70,436.59 not including working capital. This figure originated with the cost price in the year • 1912, from which the cost of plant retired from service has been de - ducted and the cost of new plant added as replacements and the de - velopment of the service required. Using the cost figure, the average return on the money invested in the property has not exceeded an aver - age of 1%% since 1918 and the property has been operated at a loss since 1925. The testimony also shows that the profits from the com - pany's operation of long distance lines have made it possible to con - tinue the exchange service after crediting the exchange with its' proper proportion. The Sterling exchange has 494 subscribers of which 201 are busi - ness and residence, and 293 are rural. It is a part of the Johnson County District, a group consisting of the exchanges of Sterling, Cook, Crab Orchard, Elk Creek and Tecumseh, all of which are provided with free service connections and thereby the subscribers of the Sterling ex - change have access to 2,093 subscribers without additional charge. A comparison with the rates as shown by the following tabulation dis - closes that the rural suscribera at Sterling have the same rates as Dorchester and Syracuse. That is also true ot larger exchanges, such as Fairbury. Sterling Dorchester Syracuse Business one party $300 $3.75 $3.75 Residence one party 1.75 2.00 2.00 Residence two and four party 1.50 1.75 1.75 Residence ten party 1.75 1.75 175 </seg>
            <seg id="p062">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT The last adjustment of rates at the Sterling exchange was made effective November 1, 1918, when the rural rates were - raised from $1.50 to $1.75. This was before the high prices of telephone materials and equipment became effective, which reached their peak in the. years 1925 and 1926. These prices are not reflected In the investment in the property, only as additions and replacements were made. It follows that much of the property Is in the investment accounts at prewar prices. Telephone rates were not permitted to soar with the prices of agri - cultural products during the war, nor can they be reduced for the reason only that the prices of these products are low- . Telephone rates which produce less than a fair return on the fair value of the property would constitute confiscation if ordered by the Commission. The method of finding fair value of public utility property to be used for rate making purposes has been stated by the Supreme Court of the United States and the use of a lower rate, except on application of the company would be illegal. In McCardle v. Indianpolis Water Company, 272 U. S. 400, the court said: "Undoubtedly the reasonable cost of a system of water works, well planned and efficient for the public service, is good evidence of its value at the time of construction, and such actual cost will continue fairly well to measure the amount to be attributed to the physical elements of the property, so long as there is no i change in the level of applicable prices. And * * *, it is true that if the tendency or trend of prices is not definitely upward or downward and it does not appear probable that there will be a substantial change of prices, then the present value of lands plus the present cost of constructing the plant, less depreciation, if any, is a fair measure of the value of the physical elements ot the property." The prices of telephone materials and equipment have gone down somewhat from their peak in 1925 and 1926; however, the book figure which is the original cost since 1912, should fairly reflect a reasonable value of property and under the decisions of the courts the Commission has no power to make rates based on the value of commodities or prop - erty which are in no way connected with the property devoted to the public use. | - The Commission believes and so finds that the prayer 6f the com - plainants should be denied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the complaint and prayer of Frank Brinkman,' George Rathe, Frank Schmidt, George Brinkman, et al... running I against the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company on account of rates for telephone ser - vice on rural lines at its Sterling exchange.

FORMAL COMPLAINT 891 Keystone- Lumber Co., et al., Loup City, Nebraska, Complainants," v. Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company and Union Pacific Rail - road Company, Defendants. DRAKE, Commissioner: a ■ ■ OPINION AND FINDING This matter came :on for formal' hearing upon complaint of Keystone Lumber Company, and others, of Loup City, against the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. and the U. P. R. JR. Co., alleging that said railroads operated and maintained rail lines in and through the city of Loup City without a track connection and praying for an order commanding the construction and maintenance of such connection. The Union Pacific, in answering, admitted receipt of request for such connection, stating that the railroads were about 400 feet apart: that such construction would require about 1100 feet of new track at a cost of approximately $5,000 exclusive of necessary right of way; that if there was a public necessity found, they were willing to join with the other railroad in construction and maintenance, and pay one-half of such expense, but further alleging that the Commission should not require such construction and maintenance unless there is a public neces - sity therefor. The Burlington filed its answer denying the existence of any public necessity, and specifically pleading a lack of jurisdiction of this Com - mission, under the provisions of Section 1 of The Transportation Act of 1920, wherein the Interstate Commerce Commission would hold the ex - clusive jurisdiction. The testimony shows that the two railroad lines are both branch lines, the Union Pacific line branching from the main line at Grand Island, and the Burlington line branching from its main line at Aurora. The record further shows that there are track connections between these two roads at both Central City and Grand Island, each a short distance from Loup City. Complainants furnished two witnesses who were in the lumber, grain and coal business. The record shows that lumber, coal and building ma - terial can now be delivered on either road at the same rate, with one exception, namely, the rate on coal from Rock Springs, Colorado, ter - ritory for delivery on the Burlington is 35c higher than on the Union Paciflt;, but that movement has not exceeded ten to fifteen cars per year. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT One witness, Mr. Outhouse, who is in the lumber and coal business has track connection with the- Burlington and desires the additional track connection with the Union Pacific, although at the present fine he has coal bins located on Union Pacific tracks and rates on other commodities received are the same over both roads. The other witness, Mr. Brown, who represents a grain and coal business, has elevators on both roads, although" the elevator on one of the roads is practically obsolete for present day truck deliveries. The rates on grain, both in and out, are the same and the testimony shows that practically all grain shipped is destined for interstate ship - ment on transit rates. The Nebraska laws provide that at any place where the tracks of two railroad companies are within five hundred feet apart, whether on the same grade or not, where it is practicable and deemed reasonably necessary. The State Railway Commission, upon the application of any interested person may require such track connection. (See Sec 74-564— Compiled Statutes 1929), and that, "the- State Railway Commission is hereby empowered and required to investigate all cases arising under the next preceding section (74-564), whether upon complaint or other - wise, and to make such order in the premises as shall seem reasonable, and to fix a time for compliance with such order." I (Sec. 74-565.) In compliance with the foregoing, this Commission held a formal hearing at Loup City, made a personal inspection] and heard the testi - mony of the complainants. The Commission has before it two questions, first, that of the reasonableness, and secondly, that | of jurisdiction, which has been raised by defendants. In view of the following conclusions, it will not be necessary to pass on the jurisdictional question. In reaching a conclusion, the Commission must necessarily take into consideration the probable original cost to the carriers of the proposed trackage, and future maintenance costs. The Commission must also consider the fact that each carrier has, through the course of years, established extensive industrial and business tracks at this point, making these capital investments with a view to future business. It would appear that if this Commission should demand a track connec - tion, that the carrier with the greatest investment would be penalized. Practically all of the revenue received by both carriers is from Interstate business, and the rates on such business being the same on both railroads, the incoming business can be routed at request of ship - per. The local less than carload shipments are not important at the present time, because It is a well known fact that the rail carriers have lost a large part of that business. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that sufficient public necessity and convenience do not exist to warrant the construction and </seg>

FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 697 C. L. Schroeppel, et al., of Bassett, Complainants, v. Bassett-Springview Telephone Company of Bassett, Defendant. DRAKE, Commissioner. OPINION AND FINDING This matter came on for hearing upon formal complaint of patrons of the telephone company at Bassett, alleging that reasonable and ade - quate service was not being furnished. Defendant company is a s»ock company, with $8,012.50 of capital' stock. One C. W. Coryell acquired 353 shares of a par value of $4,412.50 about seventeen years ago and has been acting as the manager since that time. He is in fact the real defendant, by reason of his stock ownership and the further fact that there has not been a stockholders' meeting for so many years that stock - holders fail to remember the date. Defendant in his answer denied any and all allegations of complain - ants, alleging that he was not' supposed to furnish twenty-four hour service; that he had made no exorbitant charges for services rendered after hours, alleging that he had furnished service after hours to a' I of </seg>
            <seg id="p066">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT complainants without extra charge; that the only extra charge over made for after hour service was on election night, when he charged $15.00. Defendant sets up in his answer that he offered to give twenty - four hour service if they would agree to an increase in rates of 50 cents per month for city patrons and $1.00 per year for rural patrons. Complainants in their reply deny all the allegations of the defendant relative to service conditions. The evidence develops that conditions were so bad that a local service club appointed a committee to investigate and negotiate with the defendant, relative to better telephone service, which finally resulted in the filing of this formal complaint. This committee offered as com - plaining witnesses representative business men. The testimony of these business men is all about the same. An inference can safely be drawn that not only is the service very unsatisfactory, but also that the public relations are exceedingly poor. Under the rules of the company, the exchange is kept open from 7 a.m. to 9 p. m. on week days, and 8 a. m. to 10 B|, m., and 6 p. m. to 7 p. m. on Sundays. When emergency service is needed by the public, the following is the rule: "14. We answer doctor calls at all hours of the night. In case of fire call Central. Doctor's special night ring, one extra long and two short rings." One witness testified that on the Sunday afternoon before the hear - ing, he failed to get any answer from the central office; that he later went to the central office for the purpose of trying to locate a doctor and on arrival found no one on duty. Other witnesses testified that their past experience had taught them it was useless to try to ger a message through outside of published hours. Defendant appeared as a witness, and the only direct testimony of - fered was as follows: "I have no objection to furnishing twenty-four hour service with an increased rate. I think that is all I have to offer." The above answer of defendant is apparently quite indicative of the service and personal relations conditions. It was necessary for the complaining witnesses, and the Commission on its own motion, to ' de - velop the matter and attempt to find out the reasons for the situation. Cross-examination developed that the defendant operated a radio pro - gram service, using telephone plant equipment for such purpose. The capital investment, expenses, income and the now resultant largo de - preciation were all included in the telephone accounting. Defendant admitted that it has not been a success and will result In considerable loss. The testimony developed that defendant has been paying himself, as manager and lineman, a salary of $100.00 per month; his wife a sal - ary of $50.00 per month; at present, another operator at $40.00 per </seg>
            <seg id="p067">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION month; $25.00 per month to himself as secretary; approximately $30.00 per month for rent and $30.00 per month for heat, light, repairs, etc., on the central office quarters. It might be noted at this time that de - fendant, as an Individual, owned the building and was charging the company approximately $60.00 per month for the use of one room for central office and the back yard for storage of poles. Defendant at - tempted to explain an item in the last annual report ot $2,23332 for materials and supplies, finally admitting that he had made no inventory, but thought that most of such account included the radio program equip - ment, the large part of which would be a total loss to the company. The defendant, when asked what he considered an emergency call, testified: "When someone needs a doctor, somebody dies, in case of fire, or something like that. That is all I consider emergency calls." Upon cross-examination he stated that no toll calls, unless they were a death or doctor call, would be considered emergency calls. , A study of the reports of the company for the past several years shows a rather healthy condition, notwithstanding the opinion of the defendant. The net revenue for 1930 was $1,668, the average gross in - come over a period of five years was $5,350, and the total expense average for the same period of $4,310, making an average net income of $1,040. This average net income would provide a return of 13% on the estimated present value of $8,500.00, which value has been furnished by the defendant. A further study of the expense items over the same period of time shows that over fifty per cent ot the gross revenues have been paid out to the present manager, either directly or indirectly, by way of salaries to himself and members of his family and by payments to himself of excessive rents for the use of the central office and storage space. In fact, the telephone company has been paying practically all of his expenses except the grocery bill. At many places . in Nebraska similar to Bassett, the patrons are being adequately served under the same rates. However, without ex - ception, the management has a different attitude toward the public, and places a different construction on an "emergency" call. Experi - enced and well managed telephone companies are willing, for the sake of personal relations with their community, to take care of after hour calls in all cases where they are not merely social calls. In all cases, toll messages are considered emergency calls, athough this manage - ment apparenty was very reluctant to take any toll messages at any time which' were sent "collect". This company could probably give ade - quate service by keeping open on Saturday and other nights, when the business houses are open, until a reasonable hour, and twenty-four hour </seg>
            <seg id="p068">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT service would not be necessary, but it is evident that, on account of the peculiar attitude of the management, in order to secure reasonable and adequate service,' an order for twenty-four hour service will be necessary In this case- At the present time defendant is paying his wife $50.00 per month, and another operator $40.00 per month. An additional operator should not be hard, to find during the present period of unemployment. In the event an additional 25c per month would be authorized for city service, the added revenue would be more than $20.00 per month. The defend - ant can easily provide for the balance of the money necessary to hire the additional help by reducing the amounts now being paid for central office quarters to a reasonable amount. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the complaint Is well founded; that the defendant company is not now furnishing adequate service to its patrons; that the request for twenty-four hour service is not unreasonable; and that a small increase in the rate for city service will furnish sufficient additional revenue to meet the addi - tional expenses necessary to render such service. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Bassett-Springview Telephone Company be and the same is hereby directed to furnish twenty-four hour service. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Bassett-Springview Telephone Company be and the same is hereby authorized and directed to publish and collect the following rates: Gross Net Business individual $3 00 $2.75 Residence individual '. 2.05 180 Rural business _ 2.30 2.05 Rural residence 1.80 1.55 The gross and net rate rule to apply, with the 15th day of each month as the discount date.

DRAKE, Commissioner: OPINION AND FINDING This action arises upon application of Arlington Telephone Company, " requesting authority to publish and collect a schedule of rates which provided for increased rates at its exchange at Arlington. The present and proposed net rates are as follows: Present Proposed Business - $2.00 $3.00 Residence, 1-party 1.50 1.75 Residence, 2-party .-. 1.25 1.50 Rural 1.50 2.00 A public hearing was held at Arlington, in the city hall, on December 22, 1930. Applicant appeared without counsel and about a hundred sub - scribers appeared, many vigorously protesting any increase of rates at this time, claiming that general economic conditions in that territory made it impossible for the farmers to pay any higher rates. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Applicant presented an appraisal made by the American Appraisal Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which showed an estimated repro - duction new in the amount of $99,783.05 and the property in a 74% condition- These figures were unsupported by the maker, but were of - fered to the Commission for whatever they were worth. In 1918, the engineering department of the Commission made a valu - ation of the Arlington Telephone Company on the original construction cost basis, and found a value of $38,089.33, new. This figure was spread on the books of the company at that time, and under the system of ac - counting as prescribed and supervised by this Commission, the books of the company now show a plant account In the amount of $45,900.00, which does not include working capital. ■ During this period between 1918 and 1929, a considerable portion of the plant was replaced. For instance, new central office equipment was installed and the old city distribution system removed from plant and replaced with new cable, new poles and new aerial wire. These have been properly accounted for on the books of the telephone company. All of this was done during the period of high telephone costs and, regardless of the basis of the original set-up, the Commission believes that the book costs now con - tain a fair measure of the present price levels, and will use this figure as a starting point in this application for rates. Applicant proposes to rehabilitate the rural distribution system and to make some cable extensions in the city. Exhibits were offered show - ing the proposed reconstruction of the rural distribution system in the gross amount of $5,870.89, and extensions in the city distribution in the amount of $1,995.65. In the case of the rural distribution, much of pro - posed construction is to replace old worn out poles and wire which is to be deducted from plant, using the proper accounting practice. This will probably amount to about $2,000, leaving a net addition to rural plant of $3,870.89. The city distribution extension will require \3ry little, if any, removal of old property from plant, and will therefore be taken as a net addition, which will make a total net addition of $5,866.54. Adding this to the present plant account of $45,900 gives a total of $51,766.54. The Commission has recognized that working capital must be con - sidered as one of the factors in arriving at a value for rate-making pur - poses. Realizing that this amount will vary from time to time, but that it should maintain a fair working average, the Commission has said in previous orders that approximately $2.50 per station is sufficient and, for the purposes of this case, will apply the $2.50 per station to the 195 city and 335 rural subscribers, making a total working capital of $1,275.00- This, added to the figure of $51,766.54, brings us to the total of $53,041.54. </seg>
            <seg id="p093">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION This is not a depreciated figure, but represents as nearly as possible the actual dollars that have been invested in this property. The history of the reserve shows that the amount set has not provided an accumu - lation in any substantial amount in excess of actual requirements, and the company will be required to annually set aside the same amount for maintenance and depreciation as set forth in the Commission's pre - vious orders. We come now to the expense of operation. Applicant produced and substantiated exhibits showing total maintenance to be approximately $4,200, and traffic expense In the amount of $2,290, but the Commis - sion believes and so finds that the commercial expense in the amount of $3,443.35 is too high. For the purposes of this case, commercial ex - pense will be reduced to $2,510, making a total telephone operating ex - pense of $9,000. Most of the people at the hearing were rural subscribers protesting against any increase in rural rates. One city patron complained that he wanted an individual residence phone and the manager testified it could not be furnished because they did not have the facilities at present to offer it, stating further that there were other like requests and that the contemplated changes in cable construction would provide the re - quired additional lines for any expected additional or anticipated city service- • The testimony shows power line inductive interference on practically all rural lines, requiring full metallic service and constant maintenance in a high degree. The studies of the rural service show a large percentage, of the plant investment with almost two miles of wire to each rural subscriber. The proposed rate schedule as above set forth presents an unusual spread between the farm' and city subscribers, in that the rate asked for 10-party, or rural subscriber, exceeds that of the rate asked for one-party residence subscriber. The Commission cannot at this time sanction the make-up of the proposed schedule and substitutes the fol - lowing: . Net Business, one-party $3.00 Residence, one-party 2.00 Residence, two-party : 1.75 Rural, party 1.85 The revenue produced by these rates will be slightly less than that asked for, but for the purposes of. this case at this time the Commission will enter an order to that effect. These rates will not produce an unreasonable return on the present fair value of the property. The net revenue will not produce to exceed six per cent on such value. </seg>

CHAIRMAN RANDALL PRESIDING BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING Petitioner herein is a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska. It Is engaged In the </seg>
            <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION business of owning, operating and acquiring telephone properties in Nebraska. It proposes to buy the fixed property and current assets of the Monroe Independent Telephone Company, free from all liens and encumbrances, subject to its floating obligation. Applicant has an authorized capital' stock of $2,400,000, divided into 7,500 shares of preferred stock and 16,500 shares of common stock, each share of which has a par value of $100, of which 4,000 shares of pre - ferred stock and 9,300 shares of common stock are outstanding. Peti - tioner has applied to this Commission for a permit to issue and sell 3,780 shares of its common stock in payment for the physical property and 334 shares, or $33,400 to be sold for cash at par, to provide funds to pay the floating obligations. The Monroe Independent Telephone Company owns and operates ex - changes at Albion, Loretto, Platte Center, Monroe, Lindsay, Genoa, New - man Grove and adjacent territory. Petitioner has not Included the Platte Center portion of the property under this application for cap - italization. Applicant offered in evidence an inventory and appraisal of the Mon - roe Independent Telephone Company's property! excluding the Platte Center exchange, as of November 1, 1929, which shows a reproduction value new in the amount of $481,042 and the same less deterioration in the sum of $401,434. These figures include materials and supplies, cash work - ing capital and going concern, in the sum of $60,821. Of the estimated cost new $420,212 represents the company's ap - praised value of the physical property, and $340,604 the same less de - terioration. These figures include $6,250 for right of way, which the Commission has held In other applications of this company was im - properly included. The company has a right by law to build its lines on the public highway, regardless of the consent of the property own - ers. Actual damages paid at time of construction would be a proper charge to the cost of right of way, but no evidence was offered to sustain this amount, except the general theory that such expenses might occur. Also the item of $61,600 for exchange aerial wire was challenged as too high and exceeding the costs experienced by similar companies in Ne - braska. The Commission will use 70% of this amount. When these corrections have been made, the cost new of the fixed property amounts to $389,948. Applicant's property was found to be in approximately an 83% con - dition, as determined by an inspection and referred to as deterioration in the appraisal. This does not include all factors of depreciation, such as inadequacy, obsolesence, and -accrued depreciation, which is not dis - closed by inspection- The Commission's assistant engineer inspected all of the property Involved in the application and found it to be in a </seg>
            <seg id="p096">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT 70% condition, including all elements of depreciation. When this per - centage is applied to the new figure, we have the present value of $272,964. Applicant listed Its net additions made since November 1, 1929, in a separate statement in the amount of $18,723 and construction work in progress in the sum of $6,294, or a total of $297,981, being the de - preciated value of all of the fixed assets. Going concern value in the amount of $42,021 will not be added to the above figures, as the con - stitution of this state prohibits the capitalization of intangible values, but the Commission will add $12,000 for working capital, which Should be a fair average amount of stores and supplies, cash and accounts receivable, necessary and required to operate the exchanges. This re - sults in a figure of $310,000 which is the appraised value of the property, less depreciation, and including working capital, but not intangibles. The book value of these properties is somewhat less than the above figures and would not include appreciation which has .taken place in property which has been in service for some time. Moreover, the in - vestment account is open to the criticism that to some extent capital investments, occurring by replacements, may have been charged to the depreciation reserve as permitted in the Commission's rules of ac - counting, which have since been changed. Applicant's balance sheet of the Monroe Company's properties in - cludes the physical property on the appraisal basis, plus additions and betterments to September 30, 1930. Actual current assets were used in the amount of $28,793. Included in this figure is $22,023 for materials and supplies, which appears to exceed the normal requirements for operation, and no doubt includes materials and supplies for exchanges which are under reconstruction. The liabilities disclose notes payable in the amount of $33,450. This amount will be paid from the proceeds of the sale of stock The operating statement of the properties included in the applica - tion, from January 1 to September 30, 1930, extended to one year shows that there will be a net balance for depreciation and surplus of $18,-953. Included in expenses is $12,504.75 for maintenance. To what extent de - preciation expenses have been included in this amount the- record does not show. However, the balance for depreciation will be sufficient to provide for at least 5% computed on the cost new of the depreciable property. The consolidated balance sheet of the Nebraska Continental Tele - phone Company shows that no bonds are outstanding and that a large part of the fixed capital liabilities consist of common and preferred stock, and the preferred outstanding is less than one-half of the common. Of the total sura of liabilities of approximately $2,000,000, $250,000 is found in the reserve for accrued depreciation. </seg>
            <seg id="p097">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The Commission believes and so finds that the issuance of conn:, m stock in the amount of $310,000 par value, is reasonably require.l for the purposes of the corporation.

' CHAIRMAN RANDALL PRESIDING BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING Petitioner herein is a new corporation, organized and existing un - der and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska. It has an Authorized capital stock of $75,000 divided into 750 shares of the par value of $100 each. The company is engaged in the business of owning and operating a telephone exchange in Platte Center, and adjacent territory. Applicant acquired certain telephone property near Platte Center from the Monroe Independent Telephone Company. Also, addi - tional property adjacent to Platte Center owned by R. V. Still, and telephone property owned jointly by the Monroe Independent Telephone Company and Mr. Still in the Village of Platte Center. These proper - ties constitute a telephone exchange and serve the village of Platte Center and surrounding territory. The company has applied to this Commission for a permit to issue $50,500 par value of Its common stock, in payment for the property purchased, as noted above. All of the stock will be held by the Continental Telephone Company, and none will be for sale to the public! </seg>
            <seg id="p098">TWENTY'-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Applicant offered an inventory and appraisal of the consolidated ex - change as of November 1, 1929, showing an estimated reproduction cost new in the amount of $65,284.03 and the same less depreciation in the sum of $52,981. The above figures include right of way in the amount of $1,230 and going concern value in the sum of $5,832.62. These will be excluded for reasons stated in previous orders of the Commission.

The Commission's assistant engineer testified that, the average condition of the physical property was 70%; therefore, the appriasal value, less depreciation, Is $37,702.70. Working capital will . be added to the depreciated value in the amount of $1,000, making a total of all property ready for operation in the sum of $38,702. • Between November 1, 1929, and September 30, 1930, plant was dis - placed in the amount of $619 thus reducing the present value of the property as of the time of the application, September 30, 1930, to $38,083. Applicant's balahce sheet shows current liabilities, both work - ing and accrued, in the sum of $1,116 which will be deducted as these liabilities have been assumed, thus leaving net worth in the sum of $37,000. Petitioner's operating statement from September 1 to December 31, 1930, and extended on the same basis for one year shows there will be a net available for depreciation in the amount of $1,227.42. The sum of $600 appearing in applicant's exhibits as a charge to expenses will not to be continued after the consolidation of the properties. This figure is found after $1,145 is included in expenses for maintenance and repairs. The Commission believes and so finds that the issuance of 370 shares of the common stock of the applicant is reasonably required to pay for the property purchased. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Platte Center Telephone Company of Platte Center, be and the same is hereby permitted to issue 370 shares of its common capital stock, in payment for the properties purchased as described in the application. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall charge expenses annually with not less than 5% computed on the estimated cost new of its physical property and credit its depreciation reserve accordingly, to be used to pay the cost of plant retired from service. </seg>

I APPLICATION NO. 8722 In the matter of the application of Omaha and Southern Railway Com - pany for a change in route and substitution of busses for street cars. CHAIRMAN RANDALL PRESIDING BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND ORDER Petitioner herein is a public service corporation organized and ex - isting under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, with its principal place of business in Omaha. The stock of the company is owned by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company. It owns and operates an electric interurban railway that extends from 24th &amp; N streets. Omaha, In a southeasterly direction through the town </seg>
            <seg id="p100">TWENTY'-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT of Bellevue to Fort Crook, a distance of about eight miles. Terminal facilities are rented from the parent company. Applicant operates two cars and has provided 18-hour service daily for a number of years. Petitioner n'ow proposes to discontinue the operation of its street cars, salvage the property and provide service with busses, on a public highway located near and parallel to some extent with the interurban line. The application to abandon the railway service will be considered independently of the proposition to substitute busses in the same - ter - ritory. This is necessary for the reason that the Commission has juris - diction over the rates and service of street railways and interurban service and fares, but under its jurisdiction as prescribed by the stat - ute it has no authority to order busses to be operated between points in Nebraska. Petitioner has filed a separate application to operate busses between Omaha, Belluvue and Fort Crook, which will be con - sidered on its merits, within the terms and conditions of its jurisdiction. The question to be determined in this order is whether or not ap - plicant's earnings have paid a fair return on the fair value of the property, also whether applicant could continue service under any scale of rates that the traffic would bear. The bare bones cost of the property in 1906 before any general ex - penses have been added, was $153,000. Additions and betterments to date, in the sum of $49,760 have been added to this figure at actual cost, hence approximately $203,000 represents the dollars invested. Under present prices and after deducting depreciation the appraisal value of the property should not be less than $225,000. In 1930, this Commis - sion found that the original cost of the proprety was $210,460. Addi - tions and betterments since that date should be added to this figure for purposes of comparison. The Commission will use $225,000 as the fair value of the property used and useful in testing the earnings, even though the actual cost in periods of low price levels approximates this figure. Petitioner began operation in October, 1906, and the record of op - erating revenues and expenses, including taxes, to the end of the year 1930, show an operating deficit of $30,485.98. The most profitable years were 1921 and 1922, which show net earnings available for return on the investment of $5,212.33 and $5,948.83 respectively. However, these were years of exceptional activities at Fort Crook, and are more than off set by operating deficits in the years 1913, 1914, 1915 and 1916 of $9,591.17, $2,747.86, $7,286.86 and $7,381.75 respectively. The years 1928 and 1929 which more nearly reflect present conditions show profits in the sum of $1,655.90 and $2,935.52 and the year 1930, a loss of $972.20. The company's most prosperous years show a profit of only 2%, while losses range as high as 4%. </seg>
            <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Gross revenues have declined from $40,255.81 in the year 1925 to $35,234.90 in the year 1929, with a minimum of $34,545.85 in the year 1928 and a sharp decline to $30,220.65 in the year 1930. When the growth, development and use of automobiles is considered there is little prospect that revenues for the year 1931 will reach the level of 1929, in fact the number of fares has decreased 20 percent in the first twenty - five days of January, 1931, as compared with the year 1930. If fares in the year 1931 should decrease 10% on account of increased rates, the number of revenue passengers for the year 1931, would be 329,298 as compared with 470,425 in the year 1930, which would require a sub - stantial increase in fares. Applicant shows that a 14-cent zone fare would be necessary to pay a return of 7% on a $225,000 value of the railway property. It would also mean that the round trip fare consisting of three zones each way, to Fort Crook would be 84 cents, and the same to Bellevue would be 56 cents. The Commission finds that these figures would be higher than the traffic would bear, as compared with the cost of automotor transportation. Protestants contend that regardless of whether the petitioner can earn operating expenses and a fair return on the value of its property, it should be operated even at a loss, because it is owned by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company. This means that the car - riders of Omaha would be required to pay the fares of passengers to Bellevue and Fort Crook. This would be unfair and illegal. Applicant has a depreciation reserve of $78,000 which has been ac - cumulated through years of operation. This has been charged to ex - penses annually in the amount of $3,900. The reserve has been invested in plant while the total net salvage value of the property.including the reserve would only be between $20,000 and $25,000. It follows that there will be a loss to the applicant approximating $200,000 when the property is dismantled; and removed from service. This win be necessary in order to avoid the future cost of maintenance and taxation. The Commission believes and so finds that the Omaha and Southern Railway Company has been, and is now, operating at a loss to the own - ers of the property under the present schedule of rates and this exam - ination of its affairs discloses operating conditions which have resulted in substantial losses and these will be continued if further operation is required. The Commission also finds that a schedule of fares neces - sary to pay a fair return on the fair value of property devoted to public use would be higher than the traffic would bear and only serve to bring about greater losses than those which have already been sustained. These conditions constitute an emergency which justifies the immediate suspension of service. </seg>

Two supplemental orders entered. • APPLICATION NO. 8736 In the. matter of the application of the Lincoln Traction Company for authority to increase fares in the city of Lincoln. CHAIRMAN RANDALL PRESIDING BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING This matter arises on the application of the Lincoln Traction Com - pany of Lincoln for a permit to charge and collect the following street railway and bus fares in the city of Lincoln. The matter involved certain adjustments of fares and was heard January 28, 1931, in con - nection with the company's application to modify its service and extend its lines: Zone 1 — without transfer privilege .". 5c cash Zone 2 — with transfer privilege 10c cash Zone. 3 — with transfer privilege 10c cash Tickets for school children 6 to 17 years of age, inclusive, (6-2/3c rate) 15 f 0r j 100 School children to secure certificate of enrollment from the principal of their school and to be required to present certificate when purchasing tickets and at any and all times when requested by car or bus operator. . An additional charge to be made for crossing the zone line or point separating zones 2 and 3, of 2 cents each. In connection with the above adjustment of fares, the company alleges that existing rates for service are not compensatory as applied to the present volume of traffic. Applicant further alleges that from its- net revenues it Is unable to pay operating expenses, taxes, and pro - vide for the necessary credit to its depreciation and^alntenance fund in accordance with prior orders of this Commission; also pay its fixed annual charges on outstanding bonds. Petitioner further represents </seg>
            <seg id="p104">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT that it has complied with the requirements of this Commission, made in an order approximately five years ago, whereby it was required to reinvest all net earnings of the property in an effort to conserve and continue transportation facilities and service in the city of Lincoln. The company also shows that it has expended $225,011 for new trans - portation equipment and other necessary capital expenditures required to continue and extend the service in Lincoln. The record discloses that for a number of years there has been a more or less constant and- continued shrinkage in the number of pas - sengers carried and at the same time the use of private automobiles has increased in greater proportion than the loss In traffic. In previous orders of the Commission, directed to the applicant, it has fixed 8 per cent, computed on the cost of its depreciable property, annually, for depreciation and maintenance. Applicant has been unable to comply with this requirement of the Commission, because of inade - quate revenues. In fact, in recent years, it has not been possible to set up more than 6 per cent as required in the order of the Commission in order to Insure the replacement of the xiompany's property. In fact, in the year 1930, the company experienced a deficit of $28,986.54 after paying five per cent interest on its outstanding bonds in the amount of $800,000. The company has no- surplus or reserves which may be used to pay annual operating deficits. It is a matter of common knowledge that regulatory bodies and courts have found It necessary to Increase fares In order to provide the means necessary to preserve this kind of transportation. The use of the private automobile has made the street car unpopular. Neverthe - less the Commission believes- that this means of transportation, in con - nection with the use of busses should be preserved, as long as possible, for the time has not yet come when some form of mass transportation is not needed in cities the size of Lincoln. For many years, this Commission has been in close touch with- the financial affairs of the applicant company. An exhaustive rate-investiga - tion was conducted in 1920, followed by hearings in later years, with reference to changes In service and financing in connection with this company's affairs. About five years ago, the Commission revised the applicant's financial structure in connection with the sale of a part of the company's property by eliminating its preferred stock: also making a substantial reduction in its common stock and allocating bonds to the traction property in proportion to the amount of bonds outstanding as compared with the properties retained for transportation purposes. At that time, it apeared that the company might be able to carry on . in the light of the substantial reduction in fixed charges. This has not proved true on account of falling revenues which are now below any amount which was anticipated. </seg>
            <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The record shows that the company's value of the property de - voted to the public use was taken from the figure found by the Com - mission in 1920, with additions and deductions to date, made in accord - ance with the accounting system prescribed by the Commission. This results in the figure of approximately $1,750,000. No doubt, an amount might be deducted from this figure as a measure of depreciation which has occurred in the property that has remained In the service. How - ever, any reasonable assumption as to the present operating condition would indicate the present value of the company's property to be at least $1,200,000. The company's application is predicated on its right to earn operating expenses, maintenance, depreciation, taxes and bond interest. In short, it means the payment of all operating expenses and interest on its bonds without profit to its stockholders. In view of the fact that the company Is not earning bond interest in addition to fixed charges and operating expenses the situation constitutes an emergency and may result in foreclosure unless the bond interest is paid. The record shows that the proposed schedule of rates should in - crease the revenues in the amount of approximately $46,000. However, a part of this will be needed to provide for maintenance and deprecia - tion of the street railway properties, in accordance with previous orders of the Commission, and additional depreciation required for busses in service. The Commission believes, and so finds, that an emergency exists and that the rates of fare, as applied for, and adjustments thereof are rea - sonably required for the purposes of the corporation. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Lincoln Traction Company be, and the same is, hereby authorized and directed, effective immediately, to publish and collect in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, the following schedule of street rail - way and bus rates of fare, and to establish and provide the following zones, to-wlt: No. 1 Zone Fare — Without transfer privilege 5c cash No. 2 Zone Fare — With transfer privilege 10c cash No. 3 Zone Fare — With transfer privilege 10c cash Children between 5 and 12 years of age, inclusive 5c cash (without additional charge for zones) Tickets for school children between 12 and 17 years of age, inclusive (6 2 /3c rate without additional charge for zones, during school year) 15 for $1.00* And an additional charge is to be made for crossing the zone line, or points separating No. 2 and No. 3 zones, of 2c cash. </seg>

APPLICATION NO. 8787 In the matter of the application of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company for authority to discontinue passenger motor trains Nos. 355 and 356. RANDALL, Chairman: OPINION AND FINDING The application of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company to discontinue running motor passenger trains Nos. 355 and 356 between DuBois, Nebraska, and Beatrice, Nebraska, is made in the following language, to- wit: "Comes now ' the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway 'Company and respectfully represents : I. That since the year 1927 the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company has operated on Sundays only, between .Horton, Kansas, and Beatrice, Nebraska, a passenger motor train, leaving </seg>
            <seg id="p112">108 TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Horton, Kansas, at 9:40 a. m. and arriving at Beatrice, Nebraska, at 1:10 p. m. known as Number 355 and a passenger motor train leav - ing Beatrice, Nebraska, at 1:30 p. m. and arriving at Horton, Kan - sas, at 5:00 p. m., known as- Number 356; that the operation of said trains throughout the entire territory which they were sched - uled to travel, both in Kansas and in Nebraska, have been, and are unprofitable, and have been, and now are operated by the Chicago, Rock I&amp;lnd and Pacific Railway Company at a constant loss. That because of the great loss resulting from the operation of said motor trains, your applicant made application to the Public Service Commission of the state of Kansas for permission to dis - continue the operation of said trains Number 355 and 356 between the stations of Horton, Kansas, and Bern, Kansas, and after full hearing and consideration of said case and a re-hearing and a re - consideration of said case, said Public Service Commission of the state of Kansas on January 27th, 1931, ordered: "That the applica - tion of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company, for permission to discontinue the operation of motor car service known as trains Number 353, 354, 355 and 356, operated on Sundays only between Horton and Bern, Kansas, be and the same is hereby granted." That the operation of said trains Number 355 and 356 between Horton, -Kansas, and Bern, Kansas, will be immediately discontinued in accordance with said order and the operation of said trains on Sundays between DuBois, Nebraska, and Beatrice, Nebraska, will serve no useful purpose and would entail a great expense upon said Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Com - pany. That the operation of the passenger service on said line from Horton, Kansas, to Fairbury, Nebraska, and especially from Du- Bois, Nebraska, to Fairbury, Nebraska, has for many years been unprofitable and has cost the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company large sums of moneys more than the receipts from such operation; that for the period of April 31, 1930, to October 31, 1930, all passenger business of your applicant be - tween Horton, Kansas, and Fairbury, Nebraska, was rendered at a loss to your applicant, of $29,841.48, of which amount the loss to your applicant, in Nebraska amounts to $10,537.57. That the operation of said trains Number 355 and 356 in the state of Nebraska alone, without charging any cost for main - tenance of roadbed; taxation of roadbed; taxes upon equipment; expense of superintendence, or any overhead expense, but count - ing merely the actual cost of operating the motor, cars alone, re - sulted In a loss to your applicant between the period of April 1, 1930. and November 30. 1930. of $1,064.74, and for the period of October 31, 1929 to February 28, 1930, such operation lost your ap - plicant $416.26;' that the loss from the operation of said trains Number 355 and 356 without counting any overhead cost whatso - ever has been constant and that the periods above referred to are typical of the regular drain upon the resources of your applicant due to the operation of said motor cars.. That the continued operation of said motor cars between Du- Bois. Nebraska, and Beatrice, Nebraska, would not produce enough revenue to pay the wages of employes and the cost of motor fuels and lubricants required for. the operation of said cars, and would not in any way benefit the pi'blic or this applicant. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION WHEREFORE, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company prays permission to discontinue the operation of pas - senger motor cars Number 355 and 356 on Sundays between DuBois, Nebraska, and Beatrice, Nebraska." This application was filed with the Commission on February 5, 1931, and on February 10, 1931, hearing was held in the hearing room of the Commission and all towns affected having waived the ten days' notice of said hearing, were represented by attorneys. It might be well to go somewhat into the history of the service that has been furnished on this line of road for the past eight years. In 1923, and for several years previous, the C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry Co. were running a passenger train daily between Horton, Kansas, and Nelson, Nebraska, via Beatrice and Fair - bury. Also, a freight train was run between the same points daily ex - cept Sundays. In October, 1923, the C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. "Co. made applica - tion to discontinue running the passenger train on Sundays. Hearing was held and the application was denied. On April 23, 1925, the C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. made application to discontinue running passenger trains Nos. 305 and 306 between Horton, Kansas, and Nelson, Nebraska. It developed at the hearing that the opposition to the discontinuance of running these trains was largely on account of the delivery of mail, but the passenger business had fallen off to such an extent that the trains were being operated at a loss. An order was written permitting the company to discontinue running trains Nos. 305 and 306 on Sunday, and put the equipment on to a freight train and run it as a mixed train on Sundays. This arrangement would give mail service, and also £'ve the stock shippers a chance to get their stock on the Monday market. Complaint was filed by citizens of Deshler in regard to the discontinu - ance of trains Nos. 305 and 306; hearing was held at Fairbury on July 30, 1925. An order was issued permitting the company to discontinue running trains Nos. 305 and 306, and substituting therefor mixed trains Nos. 87 and 88 between Fairbury and Horton and mixed trains Nos. 89 and 90 between Fairbury and Nelson. In September. 1927, the C. R. 1. &amp;■ P. Ry. Company made application to discontinue operating mixed trains Nos. 87 and 88 on Sunday and substitute gasoline motor car service between Horton, Kansas, and Beatrice, Nebraska, and furnish Sunday mail service to Harbine and Ellis by gas hand car service. This appli - cation was granted on the 29th day of September, 1927, and since that date mixed train service has been furnished week days. Gasoline motor service has been furnished Sundays. Owing to the prevalent use of the automobile over part of the line, bus service is being furnished. The passenger business has fallen off to such an extent that about the only revenue the company Is receiving from the Sunday service is from the government for. transporting the mail. Testimony shows that the actual out of pocket loss to the company from April 1st to November 30. 1930, was $1,064.74. This did not in- </seg>
            <seg id="p114">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT elude any depreciation on equipment, and some other out of pocket costs which were entailed by the operation of these trains. We have gone into the historical facts in regard to train service on the lines between Horton, Kansas, and Fairbury, Nelson and Beatrice, Nebraska, to some extent in order to show that there has been a steady decline in business offered to the road and a corresponding falling off in revenue. About the only service of value that is being furnished to the public and the towns intermediate is the mail, and now that the Kansas Commission has allowed the company to discontinue trains Nos. 355 and 356, between Horton and Bern, Kansas, the mail connections from the south and east are broken so that better mail service can be rendered the several towns between DuBois and Beatrice by Star Route. The Commission is. in receipt of a letter from R. L. Henderson, superintendent of U. S. Railway Mail Service, informing them that the following star routes have been established .to take effect July 5, 1931. "The established schedule of the Table Rock-DuBois route is as follows: Leave Table Rock 7:30 A. M. Arrive DuBois 8:30 A. M. Leave DuBois 8:45 A. M. Arrive Table Rock 9:45 \. M. Schedule of the Table Rock to Beatrice route: Leave Table Rock 7:30 A. M. Arrive Beatrice 10:00 A. M. Leave Beatrice on arrival of Burlington Train No. 89 due at 12:i5 P. M. Arrive Table Rock 2:45 P. M. Under this arrangement the connection, from Burlington trains 43', 44, 14 and 15 will be had at Table Rock. The routes upon arrival at. Table Rock will have connections with Burlington trains Nos. 17, 41 and 42." Under the proposed arrangement the offices now supplied by Rock Island trains Nos. 355 and 356 on Sundays will have as good if not better service than at present afforded. Taking into consideration the fact that the mall service from the south and east has been disorganized by the elimination of trains Nos. 355 and 356 between Horton and Bern, Kansas, and that better mail service will be furnished the towns be - tween DuBois and Beatrice, Nebraska; that a saving of over $2,000 a year will result to the C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Company, and as the public is not patronizing the trains sufficiently for passenger service to yield a sufficient revenue to warrant the company to continue their operation, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp;. Pacific Railway Company to discontinue the operation of trains Nos. 355 and 356 between DuBois and Beatrice, Nebraska, should be granted. </seg>

CHAIRMAN RANDALL PRESIDING BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING Applicant herein is a new corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska. It has an authorized capital of S150.000, divided into 1,500 shares of the par value of $100 each. The company will be engaged in the business of conducting an air passenger and air mail service and such other services as are incidental to air transportation. Petitioner has applied to this Commission for a permit to issue and sell 1,500 shares of its common stock for cash, at par, the proceeds of which will be used to pay for transport airships and provide the neces - sary equipment for their operation and maintenance, also working cap - ital, promotion and development of the enterprise. The estimated in - vestment required is set out below: </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Three 8 Place transport planes $75,000 Spare motors and tools 20,000 Radio equipment 10,000 ' Night flying equipment 5,000 Working "capital 40,000 $150,000 Petitioner proposes to operate airships between Lincoln, Nebraska, and St. Paul, Minnesota, for the purpose, of carrying passengers and mail. The exact routes have not been fully determined, but the proposed service will make important connections with transcontinental mail and passenger service from Chicago to the northwest, also from Lincoln to Fort Worth and Dallas to the south and west. The development of the enterprise depends on securing contracts with the government to carry mail. Passenger service will be incidental to the, air mail transportation when operation begins, although experi - ence in eastern states indicates that air transportation for passengers will develop rapidly. Purchasers of stock will pay four per cent in cash of the par amount subscribed for. This sum, or $6,000, when computed on the total amount applied for will be used to pay promotion expenses, surveys of pro - posed lines of travel, traveling expenses and. contractual negotiations. If petitioner should be unsuccessful no further payments on the stock will be required. The estimated revenues and expenses including de - preciation per mile of transportation, shows that if the mail contracts are secured there is a reasonable prospect of a fair rate of return on the common stock. The use of transport airships for carrying mail and passengers in the last few years has developed rapidly and we believe will eventually become a' necessary adjunct to the transportation systems of this country. The development of a new enterprise should always be undertaken with consideration of the uncertainties involved. The Commission believes and so finds that the issuance and sale of the stock applied for is reasonably required as set forth in the terms and conditions described in the application. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that Union Airlines, a corporation, of Lincoln, Nebraska, be and the same is hereby permitted to issue and sell 1,500 shares of its com - mon stock for cash at par.

APPLICATION NO. 9012 In the matter of the application of the Union Pacific Stages, Inc , for authority to file and publish a tariff covering a coordinated rail and truck freight service between points on Union Pacific Railroad and St. Joseph and Grand Island Railway in Nebraska. DRAKE, Commissioner: OPINION AND FINDING Applicant alleges it is a corporation duly organized to do business in Nebraska as a common carrier, proposing to engage in a coordinated rail and truck freight service of pickup and delivery of freight at points of origin and destination, and a rail haul between certain stations on the lines of the Union Pacific Railroad Company and St. Joseph and Grand Island Railway Company in Nebraska. The service proposed is substantially the same as that which has for many years been furnished by express companies, now being rendered by Railway Express Agency, except the applicant proposes to employ freight train service for the rail haul instead of passenger train service in which express shipments are handled. That applicant tenders and files herewith a tariff showing its rules and regulations, classifications, rates and charges covering said coor - dinated rail and truck freight, service, in accordance with which an- </seg>

Applicant further proposes a new service in connection with said tariff, that of furnishing C. O. D. freight service, and alleges that upon approval of the tariffs will file supplemental applications making its service available between other points in the state of Nebraska on the lines of said railway companies as rapidly as arrangements therefor can be made. The rules and regulations provide for certain limits to sizes and weights of shipments, area of pick-up and delivery being limited to city limits, no classification, reasonable markings, rates per 100 pounds or fraction thereof, 48 hours free storage with customary Btorage rates thereafter, rates for C. O. D. shipments, and a minimum charge of 50 cents. The service offered is- substantially the same service now being of - fered by the Railway Express Agency, the rail haul being on freight trains instead of on passenger trains, but with greatly reduced rates. The rules and regulations are substantially the same. Applicant now proposes this service in and out of Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, Hastings, Columbus, Kearney, Beatrice, Fremont, Norfolk, North Platte, to and from 125 stations located on said rail lines and proposes to file amended tariffs for many other stations as soon as proper contracts can be made with drayage and truck lines. A check of the present rates from a designated origin to destination point clearly indicates the new rates, as follows: Omaha to Kearney, Distance 186 miles: 1st class freight— per 100 lbs: $ .91% Double 1st class 1-83 3rd class '. : • 64 Express — Mdse. or 1st c'ass •'• 2.10 </seg>

APPLICATION NO. 9144 In the matter of the application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company for authority to substitute a custodian for the agent at their station of Lewiston. RANDALL, Chairman: OPINION AND FINDING The application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Com - pany to substitute custodian service for agency service at Lewiston was filed with the Commission on August 29, 1931. Hearing was held on this application on October 15th, after due notice had been given, at which time the company was represented by Guy C. Chambers, attorney, and the protestants by Kenneth S. Wherry and Professor Frazler. The testimony and exhibits of the company show that for the year commencing August, 1930, and including July, 1931, the revenue for car - load freight, forwarded amounts to $2,755.43 Carload freight received 5,090.11 L. C. L. freight forwarded 20.98 L. C. L. freight received _ 920.59 Ticket sales ' ....: , 76.38 . Western Union messages „ 43.93 Express ,...-. : 169.96 Making a total of . $9,077.38 The wages paid the agent at the station are $1,555.84 per year, the expense of maintaining the station Is $160.86. The company proposes to establish a custodian to handle the business of the station at a salary of $300 per year, and if the maintenance expense were the same, which it will not be — but admitting it Is, the expense of the station would be $460.86 per year. This subtracted from the agent's salary now being paid would show a savings of $1,094.98 per year. The billing of all freight forwarded could be "Bandied by the agent at Virginia as could any other business that is now being handled by the agent through +he custodian communicating with the agent at Virginia over the company's system phone. Lewiston is a town with a population of about 160 inhabitants, lo - cated 9.6 miles west of Steinauer, five miles east of Virginia and 19.7 </seg>
            <seg id="p152">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT miles east of Beatrice. There is a bank, two general merchandise stores, a barber shop, drug store, one lumber yard, two garages, two filling sta - tions, one church and a twelve grade consolidated school, with 170 pupils. As Virginia is about centrally located between Beatrice and Steinauer the station of Steinauer could handle the business at Mayberry as they now do, the station at Virginia handle the business at Lewiston, and the station of Beatrice handle the business of Rockford, without serious inconvenience to the public. After considering all the testimony and facts in the case, the Com - mission is of the opinion and so finds that in the interest of economy the company should be permitted to substitute a custodian for the agent at Lewiston, as soon as they provide a private telephone system between Lewiston and Virginia, under the terms of the following order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company be permitted to substitute a custodian for the agent at Lewiston under the following rules: 1. The depot to be kept open and well-lighted during the hours when light is necessary and heated during the time of the year when heat is necessary, at least half an hour before the arrival and departure of scheduled trains at the station, and the custodian shall be on duty in the depot and accessible during hours that the station is to be kept open for business. 2. The custodian shall be on duty and accessible during the hours from 8:00 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. and other hours necessary for the meeting of trains, for the receiving of L. C. L. freight and express and shall be authorized to receipt for express and shall order all cars for shippers and shall telephone all bills of L. C. L. freight and carload freight and shall have authority to seal the cars, both live stock and dead freight. 3. The custodian shall be given authority by the railroad company to receive and deliver any and all express that may be sent to that station and receive pay therefor from the consignee and that in all respects he shall perform the duties of an express agent. 4. Parties desiring to send a telegram from Lewiston shall redace the same to writing on telegram blanks to be furnished by the custodian. The custodian shall telephone the message to the agent at Virginia, to be forwarded by the operator at Virginia to the party to whom addressed. If the telegram Is to be prepaid the custodian shall Inquire from the operator at Virginia the amount necessary to pay the charges and the custodian shall have authority to collect the same and forward It to the operator at Virginia. In case a telegram is sent to parties at Lewis </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ton, the operator at Virginia shall telephone the telegram to the cus - todian it Lewiston, he shall reduce it to writing and deliver it to the party to whom sent, if living in Lewiston. If the party to whom the telegram is sent does not live in Lewiston, but has a telephone, the custodian shall notify the person to whom the telegram is addressed, by telephone, that there is a telegram there for him, and Inquire If he de - sires the telegram to be telephoned. If he does, the custodian shall telephone it to him, if he does not desire to have it telephoned, the custodian shall enclose the telegram in an envelope and deposit it in the United States Post Office or retain the same until the party to whom it is sent calls for it. 5. The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company must provide a private telephone line from Lewiston to Virginia over which all company business shall be transacted so that it will be absolutely private and parties at Lewiston desiring to obtain information pertain - ing to shipments from the agent at Virginia shall be permitted to use the telephone without any expense whatever. The railroad company must provide telephone service that is connected with the telephone ex - change at Lewiston, that is used by the citizens of Lewiston and vicinity so that patrons of the road may communicate with the custodian in re - gard to shipments, or other business they have with the railroad company. 6. ■ The railroad company must also provide a blackboard which shall be placed in a conspicuous location in the depot on which the time of the arrival and departure of scheduled trains is to be plainly printed. The custodian must inquire from the operator at Virginia, as to the time of the arrival of trains. When they are late he will plainly print upon the blackboard the reported arrival of the train that he gets from the agent at Virginia, so that the public may know when to expect the train to arrive. 7. The custodian shall be authorized to receipt for all express and all less than carload freight delivered to him by consignors and his receipts shall be binding upon the company. 8. The custodian shall place all baggage delivered to him by pas - sengers in the baggage car and all baggage received at the station shall be delivered by him to the parties presenting checks and in case bag - gage is received, and the parties are not there to receive it, he shall place it in the baggage room until it is called for by the passenger, and the company shall be liable to the passenger for the lawful value of the baggage until it is delivered to the owner. Less than carload freight that is unloaded for consignees at Lewiston, unless delivered to the consignee on arrival, shall be placed in the freight house by the custodian and held until called for by the consignee and the company shall be responsible to the consignee, for the value of such freight until the same is delivered by the custodian to the consignee. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT 9. Passengers shall be required to pay their fare to the conductor on the train, without any extra charge for so doing. If the passenger has baggage to be checked they shall report this fact to the conductor and the conductor shall obtain "a check from the baggage" man in the baggage car, or at the first station the train stops, and shall check the baggage and deliver the duplicate check to the passenger paying the faro to the station designated. : 10. The shippers of grain shall instruct the custodian as to the billing of their cars, and the custodian shall telephone that billing to the agent at Virginia, and the agent shall make out the billing and return it by the conductor on the first train from Virginia, to be de - livered by the conductor to the custodian, and by him to be delivered to the consignor. 11. When live stock is shipped the custodian shall report all neces - sary information to the agent at Virginia, so that he may have the billing made out, and in case a caretaker accompanies the stock, the conductor of the train taking out the car shall require the caretaker, in charge to sign the contract in his presence, and that contract shall be good for the passage of the caretaker to. the destination of the stock shipment and return. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that whereas an emergency exists, this order may be put into full force and effect when the railroad company provides a private telephone system between Lewiston and Virginia for the use of the custodian and shippers.

APPLICATION NO. 9145 In the matter of the application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific- Railway Company for authority to substitute a custodian for the agent at its station of Virginia. RANDALL, Chairman: OPINION AND FINDING . The application of the. Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company to substitute a custodian for the agent at Virginia was filed with the Commission on August 29, 1931. The application recites that due to the steady decline in the volume of business transacted at Vir - ginia, there is not sufficient revenue produced, nor sufficient service to be performed to justify the continuance of the employment ot an agent. Applicant further states that telegraph and other business which can not be handled by the custodian can be handled through the agent </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION at Beatrice. That owing to the decrease in revenue the company is desirous of bringing about a substantial economy represented by the difference in salary between an agent and a custodian. Hearing was held on this application, after due notice was given, at Virginia, on October 15, 1931. The applicant company was represented by its attorney, Guy, C. Chambers. The protestants were represented by Mr. Dwight S. Dalbey and Honorable Kenneth S. Wherry. The company produced as its witness C. A. Russell, train master at Fair - bury, with several exhibits. Several other witnesses also appeared and testified for the protestants. The testimony shows that a large part of the business at the sta - tion of Virginia is carload shipments. That the revenue for L. C. L. shipments forwarded from August, 1930, to July, 1931, amounted to : _ ' $ 174.57 Carload shipments forwarded 5,438 84 L. C. L. shipments received 597.23 Carloads received '. 6,320.60 Ticket sales '. 21.29 Western Union telegrams 47.36 Express earnings 194.45 Making a total of $12,794.34 for the last six months of 1930 and the first six months of 1931. The testimony and exhibit also show that the monthly wages for the agent for that same period amounted to $1,527.28, and that the ex - pense of maintaining the station was $165.05, making a total expense of $1,692.33. If the company were permitted to install a custodian the expense of maintaining the station would be $465.05, which would make a net saving to the company of $1,227.28. Virginia is a town of about 150 inhabitants; the population is re - maining about stationary. It has one elevator, one garage, a bank, two mercantile houses, one blacksmith shop, a barber shop, implement store, hotel, two filling stations and two' bulk gas and oil plants, one church and a twelve grade consolidated school with from 140 to 150 students. The country adjacent to the town Is thickly settled, nearly all under cultivation or tame grass pastures. Considerable live stock Is raised by the farmers, but it is really more of a grain raising than stock raising center. It Is 105 milps from Omaha and 115 miles from St. Joseph. Testimony shows that a large part of the live stock hogs and cattle are being trucked to both Omaha and St. Joseph. No grain of any kind Is being trucked. It is all being shipped by rail. Testimony also shows that both general stores buy cream, which Is trucked out of the town, principally to Beatrice. Owing to the gravelled roads very little pas- </seg>
            <seg id="p156">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT senger business is being given to the company, so that the passenger business is ot very small volume. As has been said before the volume of business is carload shipments that could probably be billed by the agent at Beatrice or Steinauer, whichever station the company desig - nated them billed at, without any additional expense to the company, but as the towns of Rockf ord and Mayberry are now served by a cus - todian there would be no agent between Steinauer and Beatrice, a dis - tance of some thirty miles, if the change in the class of service at Lewiston is granted. The company now has on file an application to change the class of service at Lewiston, from an agency to a custodial station, the billing to be done by the agent at Steinauer. The fact that this hearing was held on the same day that the hearing was held at. Lewiston, asking for a custodian in lieu of an agent, brought forcibly to the Commission's attention the necessity of an agency station between Steinauer and Beatrice. While it is true that, if the application was granted, it would bring about a saving of approximately $100 a month to the company, yet the further fact remains, that with the volume of business that is being given to the company by the stations of Virginia, Lewiston and vicinity, the patrons are entitled to agency service in connection with tha sta - tions of Lewiston and Virginia. As Virginia has the largest volume of business and is centrally located between Beatrice and Steinauer, the billing for Lewiston can be performed by the agent at Virginia and hi ing about a substantial economy. Under these circumstances the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company to substitute a custodian at Virginia, Nebraska, should be denied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Rail - way Company for authority to discontinue agency service at Virginia and substitute therefor a custodian, is hereby denied.

APPLICATION NO. 9174 In the matter of the application of The Pullman Company for authority to amend its tariffs covering charges for Pullman service to include a charge for second passenger in berths. RANDALL, Chairman: OPINION AND FINDING This application was made by The Pullman Company for authority to make a charge of 20 per cent of the rate on lower berths fare for the second passenger in their sleeping cars in the following language. to-wit: "The Pullman Company herewith submits for filing and ap - proval of your Commission Supplements Nos. 10 to 16 inclusive to Pullman Tariff No.. 6 Surcharge Tariff Pullman No. 10 which petitioner desires to make effective October 15, 1931, on in - trastate business in your state. The proposed changes made by these revised pages are to pro - vide a charge for second passenger in berths and sections when such accommodations are occupied by more than one passenger. : An exception is made for children under twelve years of age for whom full railroad transportation is not required. The rate provided for second passenger is an amount equaling twenty, percent of the lower berth fare, that being the unit upon which charges for all accommodations" are based. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">156 TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT The present tariff permits occupancy of such accommodations by two persons without charge for the second passenger, the fare being the same for two passengers as for one. The proposed changes follow in principle the distinction in rate for one passenger and for more than one passenger which has been in effect since May 1, 1930, covering single occupancy sections. This application is based upon the following special circum - stances and conditions which are relied upon as justifying the proposed changes: The object sought in making .the change is to obtain additional revenue from a source where It can be obtained fairly and reason - ably, and where under existing tariffs no charge whatever is made for service furnished. . A study of the company's records of travel shows that more than 90 percent of berth accommodations are occupied by one passenger only, and less than 10 percent by two passengers. The charge therefore affects only a small portion of sleeping car travel. The small differential of twenty percent of lower berth fare is more than justified in value to passengers of the service fur - nished. The second passenger obtains sleeping accommodations: has all the facilities of the car at his disposal, a seat during the time when berths are. not in use for night occupancy and access to observation club and lounge cars on the train. He also pays rail fare the same as the first passenger. Sleeping car service in some respects is similar to that fur - nished by a hotel; and it Is a matter of common knowledge that the almost universal practice among hotels is to make an addi - tional charge when two persons occupy a room. A moderate charge in such cases, both as to hotel guests and sleeping car patrons, appears entirely reasonable and consistent. There is necessarily an element of expense in furnishing ser - vice to the second passenger, and it is appropriate that a sleeping car charge should be made by which he will bear a reasonable proportion of the total cost. The total expense of the service amounts to so large a pro - portion of gross earnings that additional revenue is imperatively needed. The company's operating ratio on all business in 1930 be - fore taxes was 90.46 per cent. For the first' six months of the current year the operating ratio before taxes was 93.75 per cent. The company has been diligent in its efforts to reduce its expenses, but the nature of its service in furnishing cars to the railroads sufficient to meet travel requirements and the inevitable decreased occupancy per car resulting from the decline in passenger traffic, has made it impossible to curtail expenses to meet declining revenue. Favorable results have been accomplished in the sale of single occupancy sections and by a greater degree of activity on the part of employes of the company in advancing the sale of accom - modations. In this way revenue requirements have been supple - mented, and it is hoped that the present plan as set forth in the tariff now being filed will accomplish still further results in ihis direction. The' proposed charge is ' therefore amply justified by the ex - pense incident to the added service, by the company's need for </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the revenue, and especially by the value of the service furnished to the second passenger for which heretofore no charge has been made. It is by no means a universal increase as it applies only to the small percentage of berth passengers heretofore paying nothing because included in the fare for accommodations furnished two passengers under applicable tariffs. In the best judgment of the officials of the company this situation should be corrected. In view of the constantly increasing tendency of the traveling public to occupy separate accommodations for each passenger it is believed that the small differential prescribed for those who desire to occupy berth accommodations with others will not work a hardship and will be recognized as an extremely moderate charge for the service furnished. The surcharge tariff, specifying charges based upon this com - pany's fares, is amended to accord with changes applicable to the charge for second passenger. Appropriate changes in tariff rules to accord with the changes in rates have been made. On September 1, 1931, petitioner filed with the Interstate Com - merce Commission supplements to its interstate tariffs providing for a similar second passenger charge on interstate business, ef - fective October 15, 1931. Petitioner prays that said tariff may be approved by your Com - mission to become effective on intrastate business in the State of Nebraska on and after October 15, 1931." Hearing was held on this application on the 29th day of September, 1931, in the office of the Nebraska State Railway Commission. The ap - plicant was represented by L. M. Greenlaw, general attorney; E. P. Burke, general passenger agent; L. M. Bradish, assistant comptroller, and H. L. Cook, resident representative. Mr. Nathan Grossman and Mr Ralph Plummer representing the Travelers Protective Association ap - peared for the protestants. As the application of the company is not only an increase in sleeping car rates, but increases passenger tares and there was no representative of the railroad companies present ask - ing for ah increase In railway fares, the Commission interrogated the witness for the Sleeping car company as to the necessity for the in - crease. In answer to the question by the Commissioner, asking if the railway companies had been consulted in regard to the application. Gen - eral Passenger Agent Burke, answered as follows: "May I suggest this action was taken without consulting the railroad company, and not necessarily with their approval or good wishes." There were no exhibits filed with the Commission showing the amount of revenue received by the company, or the out of pocket cost for furnishing the service, but witnesses testified that the revenue re - ceived by the company for intrastate revenues for all accommodations was $71,238.14 for the year ending June 30. 1931. and that about 10 percent of the traffic was for two occupying the same berth. This would involve for the second passenger an additional charge in the neighbor - hood of $7,000 per year, and that the additional revenue to the company, </seg>
            <seg id="p162">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT If the application of the company was allowed, would make an increase to the company of $1400, including surcharge, per year lor lower berth revenues. The testimony shows that ever since the sleeping car system was inaugurated there has been no extra charge for two in a berth. For some years last past and at the present time, passengers occupying seats or berths in sleeping cars have been required to pay an additional fare to the railroad company of one-third of the sleeping car charge as a surcharge, which is charged to. the passenger by the sleeping car com - pany, and by it turned over to the railroad company. This makes an additional cost for railroad fare to the passenger occupying either a seat or a berth in the sleeping car. It was shown that nearly all of the sleeping car charges in Nebraska, being for a long distance, amount to approximately $3.00 to be paid to the sleeping car company and $1.50 for the surcharge, making a total cost to the passengers of $4.50. If the prayer of the applicant should be granted and the company be per - mitted to charge an additional 20 percent of the lower berth rate, this would make an added charge of 90c of which the sleeping car com - pany would receive 60c and the railroad company an additional fare of 30c. This added to the 3.6 cents railroad fare being paid by the pas - senger to the railroad company would in the average haul, where pas - sengers are using sleeping car facilities, bring the railroad fare up to practically 4c per mile. There were no exhibits presented to the Commission, showing that the company was not at the present time receiving sufficient revenue to make a reasonable return on its investment after paying overhead ex - penses. The principal claim made by the applicants was that where two passengers were occupying the same berth, two people were receiv - ing the privileges of the use of toilet facilities and where observation cars were attached to the train, the use of a seat in the observation car. These allegations undoubtedly are true, but as this practice has. been in force ever since sleeping car companies commenced operation, and as the small additional cost to the company for the use of towels soap, etc., in the toilet compartment is so small, the Commission does not feel that item should be seriously considered. It is the practice of the Commission where applications for increase of rates are made to require the applicants to make a showing as to their income and expenses and the value of the property used and useful in rendering service and to make a showing as to whether or not the charges made by the company for the service, are remunerative to r.uch an extent that after overhead expenses are paid a sufficient amount of revenue has been received to pay a reasonable return on the invest - ment. There is nothing in the testimony to show what the value of the property used and useful in the conducting of the business is, nor was there any testimony to show what the out of pocket expense In </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION conducting the business is, nor what .the net return from the conduct ing of the business is, nor has any testimony shown that there was a ne - cesity for an increase in rates to make the company a reasonable return on the value of Its property. This being the fact, the railroad com - panies would be sharing in the increased charges if allowed. As the railroad companies would share in the larger charges, we are, in effect, asked to increase the regular passenger fares. It seems that we are not justified in attempting to. alter railroad fares as they were fixed at the present level, both interstate and intra - state, at 3.6c per mile by the Interstate Commerce Commission. In creased Rates, 1920, 58 I. C. C. 220; Nebraska Rates, Fares and Charges, I. C. C. Docket 11829, 60 I. C. C. Reports 305; Railway Commis - sion v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563. The action of the Interstate Commerce Commission seems to be a complete occupancy of the field, and it appears that this Commission has no jurisdiction on that account. Further, we are precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this subject by Section 74-804, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, pro - viding that the maximum fare which a railroad is permitted to charge is 2c per mile. It was held in State v. Clarke, 98 Nebraska 566. that the Railway Commission has no power to increase maximum passenger fares fixed by the legislature. Of -course, these objections to jurisdic - tion relate only to that part of the fares that would go to the railway companies. The railroad companies not being parties herein and the rule of procedure being that applications should be made by all parties at in - terest having not been complied with, the present application could not be ; ustained. The testimony shows that while this applicant has made application In 48 states for these intrastate increases and that only the states of California and Florida have acted favorably, and the state of Oklihninn has acted unfavorably, it would indicate that if these matters are taken up by the several states and either accepted or rejected. It would place the traveling public in a. position where they would not have any guar - antee-as to what sleeping car rates were to be from place to place, out - side of the borders of the state in which they were traveling. To in - crease sleeping car rates in Nebraska above rates for like service in other states would be unfair to the patrons of the sleeping car company in Nebraska, and in the judgment ot the Commission would be a gross discrimination by reason of the rates being fixed between state lines. After taking all of the testimony into consideration the Commission is of the opinion and so .finds, that the application ot the Pullman Com - pany for authority to amend its tariffs covering charges for Pullman service to include a charge for second passenger in berths, should be denied. </seg>

Granted November 16, 1931. APPLICATION NO. 9219 In the matter of the application of the Lincoln Traction Company, tor reduction of fares and readjustment of fares, in the city of Lincoln. RANDALL, Chairman: OPINION AND FINDING The hearing in this case was held before Commissioners Randall and Miller, Thursday, October 29, 1931, at 10:30 o'clock a. m., in the Com - mission's hearing room in the state capitol, Lincoln, after notice had been given to the city commissioners of Lincoln and the public, through the press. The applicant in this case is a common carrier, and owns and oper - ates a combined street railway and bus transportation system in the city ot Lincoln. Applicant applied for authority to reduce, revise and rearrange rates and rate schedules on their system in the city of Lincoln, in connection with its transportation property, and to abandon the so - called zone fare system and inaugurate a straight ten cent fare, except only for school children and children between the ages of five and twelve years, and children under five years of age when accompanied by par - ents or guardians to be carried free; tickets for school children between thirteen and seventeen years of age, inclusive, to be sold 6% cents each, or fifteen tickets for $1.00, with transfer privileges during the school year; school children to secure certificates of enrollment from the prin - cipal of their school and to be required to present the certificate when purchasing tickets, and at any and all times when requested by car or bus operators; children between the ages of five and twelve years," straight five cent fare; the fare for all other classes of passengers to be straight ten cent cash fare, with transfer privileges to all persons over thirteen years of age, excepting as heretofore set forth in connection with school children. Approximately nine months ago, applicant company, in an exhaustive hearing before the Commission, set forth in. detail its adverse financial condition. At that time applicant proposed a zone fare system, in an effort to stimulate traffic, and if possible, to continue to provide a trans - portation system for the citizens of Lincoln. Applicant stated to the Commission at that time that the -proposal • was experimental, and that periodical reports would be made to the Commission respecting the experiments, which has been done. It now appears, from the testimony </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION in this case, that the zone fare system has been a failure; that the riding public has not responded to it. The testimony of Mr. E. R. Heiny, vice president and general man - ager ot applicant company, shows that for the nine months period of 1931, during practically all of which time the zone fare system has been effective, the Lincoln Traction Company has carried 963,585 passengers less than for the corresponding period of time in the year 1930. Mr. Heiny's testimony further L shows that including school' children, and from May to September, 1931, under the zone system, the total number of passengers availing themselves ot the five-cent fare amounted to only 107,760; that the number of passengers riding on the ten-cent fare amount - ed to 871,345; and that the number of passengers riding on the twelve - cent fare aggregated 223,630. Placed upon a percentage basis, the five - cent fare passengers constituted 8.96% of the total passengers carried during said period; the ten-cent fare passengers constituted 72.43%; and the twelve-cent fare passengers constituted 18.61%. These figures show conclusively the obvious failure of the five-cent fare to stimulate, to any perceptible extent, travel and traffic in its five-cent fare zone. These figures also show that a major portion of the traveling public, In the city of Lincoln, quite clearly reside outside of the five-cent zone, the limits of which were fixed by prior order of the Commission, or put dif - ferently, approximately 92% of the traveling public, riding the trans - portation system of applicant company during said period, rode under the ten-cent and twelve-cent fares. These facts and figures are interesting in connection with the present application of the Lincoln Traction Company, in that if a ten-cent fare be authorized, the rate of fare of over 72% of the car riders of the city would apparently be undisturbed; the rate ot fare of approximately 19% of the car riders of the city would be reduced from twelve cents to ten cents, while the rate of fare of less than 9% would be increased. The figures used in connection with the five-cent fare include school children, and the five-cent fare will still obtain in their behalf. Mr. Heiny stated that he did not know exactly how many school children availed themselves of the five-cent fare in the five-cent zone, but according to. his best judgment, there was at least 20% of such traffic which would not be increased under the application. There have been several hearings before the Commission during the past two or three years, and exhaustive testimony has been presented, showing the desperate financial condition of the Lincoln Traction Com - pany. The Commission, on several occasions, has reviewed this condi - tion, and it is not necessary at this time to go into detail as to the facts of the financial condition of this company to any great extent. The testimony shows, however, that the operating expenses of the company </seg>
            <seg id="p170">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT have been reduced at this time to an absolute minimum; that every known operating economy is being practiced, in order to save dollars. Notwithstanding this fact, Mr. Heiny 's testimony shows that for the first nine months of 1931, the- earnings of the Lincoln Traction Company have fallen short, by . approximately $88,000, of actually meeting bond interest, operating expenses and taxes of the company. The testimony shows that applicant, in the past, has had difficulties in meeting its fixed charges and operating expenses, but succeeded in doing so until about a year or so ago, when the shrinkage and decline in revenue developed so rapidly that the company was not able to meet overhead expenses and bond interest. The testimony shows that for a period of many years there have been no dividends declared; that the credit of the company has been exhausted; that it has no surplus or undivided profits, and that they are unable to borrow in banking circles to carry on their business. Notwithstanding these facts the company, in the last six years, has invested in excess of $280,000 in additions and better - ments, for the purpose of providing transportation facilities, in the hope that under bus operations and rerouting, and other rearrangements of service, traffic could be stimulated to such an extent that the amount advanced to the company by the parent company could be repaid, but this hope has never been realized. Testimony also shows that in past years the company has purchased electric energy for the operation of Its street railway system, in com - pliance with prior orders of the Commission, and has actually saved, since that order was written, which was some five years ago, in excess of $156,000 in the cost of electric energy, in operating its street cars. The testimony also shows that the traction company has fulfilled its assurance to the Commission of five years ago, that it would reinvest in its properties all earnings, if any, over and above actual operating expenses, taxes, and other fixed charges, for a period of five years. Not only has the company carried out this agreement, but they have -borrowed heavy sums of money In order to keep their traction system functioning, and if possible, avoid -discontinuance. The applicant company has at all times met its tax obligations dur - ing the last eleven years, which have amounted to over $550,000. It la, at the present time, paying the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, an occupation tax of one per cent on its income, and Is complying with the ordinances of the city in conducting its business. There is an absolute necessity for a city with a population of over 80,000 people, to have adequate transportation facilities. The company furnishing this service should receive sufficient revenue with which to pay fixed charges, and receive a reasonable return on its investment The applicant company is not asking, in this case, for a return on its investment, bat is asking tor sufficient revenne to pay fixed charges and </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the interest on its bonded indebtedness. This issue is not one between the Commission and the applicant company. It is a subject of interest to the citizens of the city of Lincoln. The question at this time is one of preservation, in some form, of mass transportation, to serve the citizens of the city. The causes for the falling off of business to the applicant company are multitudinous. They Include the increased use of the automobile, unrestricted and unregulated taxicab competition; the practice, more or less, of the citizens of the city, of picking up their friends on the various street corners -and hauling them free of charge;, and the topography of the city. There are some other causes, but it is not necessary to enumer - ate them here. The applicant company frankly states, in its application, that it cannot predict the outcome of the proposed rate schedule. The answer to that question will be answered by the traveling public in the future. The Commission feels that it would not be doing its duty, not only to the applicant company, but to the citizens of the city, if they did not exert all their power to prevent the discontinuance of street car service in the city of Lincoln, and to bring about experiments that would stimulate traffic and increase the earnings of the company, and the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the applicant company should be permitted to discontinue zone fares, as the discontinuance of the same will not disturb the fares of at least 72%, and will decrease the fares of approximately 19% of the patrons of the company. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission, that the Lincoln Traction Company, be and the same is hereby authorized and empowered to abandon and discontinue the zone system of fares in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, and it is further ordered that the Lincoln Traction Company be authorized and empowered, pending further orders from this Commission, to install and charge, in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, the following schedule and rates of fare for trans - portation: 1. 10c cash fare, with transfer privileges, to all persons over thir - teen years of age, except as hereinafter provided. 2.

Co. for authority to consolidate service for the stations of Brayton and Cushing. DRAKE, Commissioner: OPINION AND FINDING This matter came on for hearing on November 19, 1931, upon the application of the carrier. The hearing was held at the St. Paul court house, as the place most convenient for all parties concerned. There were many interested patrons and shippers present from Brayton, Cush - ing and the surrounding territory. The application states as follows: "Amongst other ot the railroad company's lines of railway is one taking off of its main St. Louis to Billings line of railway at the station of Aurora, Nebraska, and continuing thence in a gen - eral northerly direction to Burwell, Nebraska, a distance of 104 miles. The station of Brayton is now operated by a non-telegrapher operator; the station ot Cushing by a telegrapher operator. The two stations are 14 miles apart, Cushing being the nearer to the station of Aurora. By employing a custodian at each -station and one agent to serve both stations, the public will be amply served and the Railroad Company will save about $700.00 per year. "Your petitioner incurs now for its out-of-pocket expense at the station of Cushing the following items, to-wit: Telephone expense $ 42.00 Lighting expense — : — — Telegraph expense Heating expense 20.80 Water expense _.

The train service at these stations consists of a passenger motor car operated daily each way; eastbound scheduled to arrive at Brayton at 10:19. A. M. and at Cushing at 10:49 A. M.; westbound at Cush - ing at 3:05 P. M. and at Brayton at 3:34 P. M. Also, a freight train is operated daily except Saturday eastbound out of Brayton at 12:10 P. M. and Cushing at 1:05 P. M. The reverse movement westbound daily except Sunday out of Cushing at 10:00 A. M. and Brayton 11:05 A. M. "If your petitioner is permitted to enter into the proposed ar - rangements, headquarters for the agent will be at Brayton, and he will go to Cushing each day except Sunday on passenger train No. 54, which passes Brayton at 10:19 A. M., arriving at Cushing at 10:49 A. M., and will serve the latter station until the arrival of train No. 53, scheduled to leave at 3:05 P. M. to arrive at Brayton at 3:34 P. M.

Trucks and motor busses are largely responsible for diminu - tion in freight received and forwarded, ticket sales, cans of cream and expressage. The railroad company receives but a fraction of the express earnings, its agent receiving 10% of the same in addi - tion to his remuneration paid by. the Railroad company." At the present time the carrier employs a full time agent at each station. The present salary is about $1,650 for the telegrapher agent at Cushing, and $1,304 for the non-telegrapher agent at Brayton, mak - ing a total of $2,954. Under the proposed plan, a telegrapher agent. stationed at Brayton, would each day spend part of his time at Cushing. This arrangement would require the services of a custodian at each place, the cost of which will be about $600 per year at each place. The total cost then, of the proposed plan, in wages, will be about $2,800, If the cost of custodians is $50.00 per month. On the face of it. It appears that there will not be any great saving. However, there is one argument in favor of this arrangement which so far has not been stressed, that is, that under the present arrangements two families are given employment, while under the proposed arrangement, three families can be given employment. The Commission is well aware of the tact that there are many men to whom work of this kind is very acceptable. At Cushing the custodian will have a place to live, with heat and light furnished. Work of this kind, under the present conditions, should be very acceptable to any community. Practically the only objection to this arrangement comes from Cush - ing, and the objectiftns are mainly to the fact that the taking away of a resident telegrapher agent is just another step toward the apparent gradual decline in growth of the smaller rural villages and communities. The answer to' such objections must be that the Commission can only consider the adequacy of the service in proportion to the amount of business furnisbed to the carrier by such community. Whenever the business received decreases to the point that it does not warrant the keeping of a full time agent, then it is the recognized duty of the Com - mission to allow the curtailment of the service. In the present cases, the receipts have been gradually decreasing, and from the records avail - able at this time, the average total business will probably be consider - ably less than $10,000 for each station for 1931. Taking into considera - tion the known costs of operation, such receipts will not allow for the ratio of present expenses shown at these stations. This is the first application of this kind by this carrier, and is In the nature of an experiment. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application is apparently reasonable, and will be granted for a trial period of six months. The Commission will keep in close touch with the situation during such period of time. </seg>

RESOLUTIONS R, 81 In the Matter of Class Rates Between all Stations in Nebraska. Hearing held February 16, .1931, continuing February 20, 1931, by all members of the Commission, Chairman Randall presid - ing. R. 96 In the Matter of the Establishment of Rates on Carload Ship - ments of Live Stock Provided in Resolution No. 74. RESOLUTION NO. 100 In the matter of the investigation of railroad rates on grain and grain products applicable to intrastate traffic in Nebraska. BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING Pursuant to notice previously given, this matter came on for hearing March 30, 1931, before Chairman Randall, Commissioners Drake and Miller, at the Cornhusker Hotel at Lincoln. On April 23, 1931, an addi - tional hearing was held before the entire Commission at the same place. This proceeding, involving all grain rates on movements having origin and destination within the state of Nebraska, was instituted by the Commission under circumstances as set forth below. . The Interstate Commerce Commission, in an order dated December 30, 1926, instituted an investigation into the rates on grain and grain products between points within the western district and between points within the western district and the state of Illinois and from the western district, when for export, into any ports of the United States, including points on the Rio Grande river and ex-lake rates on grain and grain products when for export. The Interstate Commerce Commission insti - tuted this proceeding tinder the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission Act as amended, as directed by the Hoch-Smith Resolution. The title of the case is Docket 17000, Rate Structure Investigation Part 7, Grain and Grain Products within Western District and for Export. The Nebraska Commission, under its Resolution No. 100, dated Janu - ary 19, 1927, entered an order making all Nebraska roads respondents to this proceeding and had served upon each of said respondents a copy of the resolution. All interested parties were also served with a copy of this resolution, which provided that the Interstate Commerce </seg>
            <seg id="p192">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Commission had requested the cooperation of the Nebraska State. Rail - way Commission in the general investigation and suggested joint hear - ings and joint conferences in so far as it might be necessary and proper: also that the proposed investigation by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission made it necessary for the Nebraska Commission to enter into an investigation as to the intrastate rates on grain and grain products to determine whether or not such rates were unjust, unreasonable, un - justly discriminatory, unduly prejudicial or otherwise unlawful and for the purpose of determining a schedule of lawful rates to apply on such traffic and for the further purpose of making such findings and orders as might be deemed necessary after a thorough investigation of all the matters referred to. After the Interstate Commerce Commission entered Its order in the above mentioned docket, the Nebraska Commission entered a supplement to its resolution asking for specific information as to certain features of the general case in their relation to Nebraska traffic. At the hearing March 30, 1931, counsel, on behalf of the respondents stated (R. 6): "While the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission is very objectionable to the railroads and it seems almost certain that the railroads will attempt to have that order enjoined In the courts, nevertheless, the only practical way of handling these large rate adjustments is to have the same basis of interstate and state rates, therefore, as soon as the railroads find out what the Interstate Commerce Commission rates will be, it is their position in Nebraska, as in other states affected by this situation, to propose for intrastate application rates and various transit privileges cor - responding to what the Interstate Commerce Commission had de - cided upon for the interstate traffic. As I say, those rates won't be proposed because the railroads want them or approve them but simply to keep the state and interstate rates harmonious." During the course of the hearing, it was agreed by the respondents that they would file, as soon as possible, their tentative proposals rela - tive to the interstate grain rate adjustment, subject to any changes that might take place by reason of a supplemental, order that might be issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission; At the hearing on the 23rd of April, the. respondents submitted ex - hibits showing the original and amended reports of the Interstate . Com - merce Commission. Copies of some of the proposed rates were also sub - mitted by the respondents. A brief statement by the respondents rela - tive to the transit rules and regulations was presented in which they expressed the desire to have the same transit rules effective on intra - state traffic as were to be applied on Interstate traffic. Carriers also advised that it was not their intention at this time, to change very materially, the present transit privileges now in effect but that at a later </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION date it was anticipated certain changes would be made eliminating some of the obsolete provisions. Respondents also indicated that it was not their intention to publish joint rates but should the occasion arise they would be willing to publish such joint rates as would be necessary to take care of individual situa - tions, it being the thought of respondents that this method would avoid the publication of a lot of paper rates involving useless expense and labor. After a considerable amount of testimony had been Introduced bearing on this subject, the respondents, not speaking definitely for the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, revised their first conclusions by making the following statement: "To meet this situation it is the idea of the carriers that we might publish a single sheet tariff for two line application naming the Western Trunk Line scale as published in the Interstate Com - merce Commission decision and have the scale apply for continu - ous mileage over the two lines. That wouldn't, of course, apply to Omaha, as the market, but would apply elsewhere." (R. 201 April). Respondents indicated that it was their desire to cancel out the higher Omaha rate application now in effect and to provide the group rates subject to the maximum rates as indicated in the Western Trunk Line scale for interior movements. Respondents also had the following to say relative to the transit rules and regulations. "There has been some discussion of transit rules and regula - tions, which the carriers must publish governing transit on the inter - state shipments and are being revised, the changes in the supple - mental decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission having af - fected transit to a great extent. It is the proposal of the Nebraska lines that the rules and regulations which are filed with the Inter - state Commerce Commission should also be the rules and regulations governing transit in Nebraska. As soon as the revised transit rules and regulations are in proof form, the final proof, the car - riers will, if this is agreeable to. the Commission, mail copies to the Commission and to the parties of record, and of course if there are no protests or objections, presumably it will be satisfactory to let them become effective on intrastate traffic. - If there are ouch protests and the Commission deems a hearing necessary, hearing could be held shortly and it is suggested that whatever rules the Commission finds would be just and reasonable and which the Carriers trust will be the same as interstate rules, could be allowed to take effect on short notice." (R. 201-202, April) Respondents stated that it was their intention to continue for the time being, the present milling in transit provisions. The following excerpts from the testimony will serve to indicate the attitude of the carriers relative to the rate adjustment, the manner of checking in rates and various other phases, including the manner of meeting cross-country competition, etc.: ........: </seg>
            <seg id="p194">190 TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT "BY MR. HOFFELDER: I might say the leading checking rates are based on rates checked on the commercial competitive situation. I will answer your question directly — BY MR. WHITTEN: That then would take into consideration your cross-country adjustment? BY MR. HOFFELDER: Yes, sir." (R. 11, March) BY MR. HOFFELDER: • • • Of course the mileage scale is not to be exceeded between key points, therefore the rates will be somewhat lower than the mileage scale • • • (R. 50, March) BY MR. SMITH: Q. Mr. Hoffelder, I don't quite understand how you propose to publish the key-point rates to Omaha from points, take for example, Sweetwater, the first station west of Ravenna. Ravenna, .that is a key point rate, 14c using W. T. L. rate, the first point west 16c. I don't quite understand how you propose a 16c rate for the first stations west of Ravenna. A. I don't recollect. I would say this. The rates between Ravenna and Alliance, there should be a grade, between the 14c key point rate for Ravenna and the 22c key point to Alliance, to Omaha. Q. How were you going to grade into the distance scale? BY MR. LITTLE. Mr. Hoffelder, as I understand your Illustra - tion, you take two factors between Ravenna and Alliance, 14c key point from Ravenna to Omaha, and 22c from Alliance to Omaha, which would make the sum of 36c to apply for a point midway between the two, averaging that, dividing by two and making 18c for the point between the two points. Now what would you do as to Sweetwater, which is the next station beyond, in that case? A. You have picked out territory in Nebraska which has quite a distance between key points. When I was testifying I had refer - ence to such territory as I "spoke about, between Fairmont on the one hand, and Lincoln, on the other hand. Q. What would your observation be as to a maximum, Ravenna to Alliance? A. We would make a grade and in some cases the rates would perhaps be on the mileage — in a case of that kind — in no case higher than the mileage. Q. When you say on the lines you refer to Western Trunk Line territory? A. Western Trunk Line short line distances. Q. And the application of the full scale? A. Yes, sir. BY MR. SMITH: How much of a step up are you going to make? A. About %c as I recall it," (R. 55-56, March) BY MR. LITTLE: Then you say that you would use the West - ern Trunk Line scale as a maximum? </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION A. (Mr. Hoffelder) No, not as a maximum. Used it as some - thing which we should not exceed. Run everything on the scale. That is what we consider a reasonable maximum scale — a decision which is handed to us in the nature of a reasonable maximum scale of rates. (R. 82, March) BY MR. LITTLE: That would not exceed the scale. Where would those rates be fixed with relation to the scale lower than the W. T. L. for the short line mileage. If you know? A. (Mr. Hoffelder) Speaking for the Burlington, all rates would be published on the basis of short mileage to Omaha. . Q. And applying to what measure of rates? A. The scale. Q. W. T. L.? A. Not to exceed. The carriers here, by reason of cross country competition 4th section, we might have lower than the scale. Q. Take your line running to Scottsbluff, would your rates on that line be established on the W. T. L. scale from the points in - volved, or a basis higher or lower? A. No higher than the scale. Might be lower by reason of the cross-country competition. (R. 83-84, March) BY MR. LITTLE: Isn't it a fact, Mr. Hoffelder. that the grain movement is about the most sensitive traffic you have? The difference in rates as between the lines in the same territory, difference in rates on one line as compared with another, will draw the traffic to the other line serving the same general ter - ritory? A. That is perhaps true. Perhaps the grain men could more conclusively testify as to that than a railroad man. (R. 76, March) BY MR. SMITH: Going back to the question of rates to and from interior points in Nebraska. It is my understanding that re - gardless of whether you use a distance scale on the group basis, that as proposed by the Union Pacific, really the basis would be the distance scale? A. (Mr. Hoffelder) Yes sir. Q. While in the case of rates from Omaha to Interior points in some cases, that would be on the distance scale and in other cases less than the distance scale where made on the key-point basis with relation to a step up? A. That is correct. Q. - I believe that is all." (R. 72-73, April) BY MR. DANA: I would first like to answer Mr. Smith about the progression to be made out in the country to Omaha. We tried to fix these rates on a gradation of about % cent. (R. 96, April) The shippers proposal was to the effect that there should be more key points designated; that all rates to the market should be on a some- </seg>
            <seg id="p196">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT what lower basis than the rates proposed for interior movements; that the absolute short line mileage should be the basis for figuring the rates; that cross country competition should be given careful considera - tion in the establishment of proper rates; that joint line rates should be established with transit privileges. "BY MR. LITTLE: I want to say on the record, that we feel that it is very necessary to have some sort of transit arrange - ments under the two line joint basis of rates, generally speaking, the rates fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission contem - plated some transit privileges in connection with the rate struc - ture and it is. the position of the people I represent that we would sooner pay some slight arbitrary over the Western Trunk Line scale for the two line haul and enjoy transit privileges under such an adjustment, than to establish that scale without transit privileges. Generally speaking, the demand for grain in one sec - tion is supplied from points where it is available through the es - tablished grain trade. As a practical matter grain trade has stor - age elevators between the origin and destination and should be able to function in finding supply and sending it to a consumer. We think that transit arrangements are vital in the case of the suggested rate adjustment." BY MR. FITZPATRICK: If joint line rates are published. I would think as far as mills are concerned, as far as we are con - cerned, that it would be essential that transit be allowed on them if they are established." (R. 228-229, April) Shippers also contended that the present milling in transit arrange - ments should be continued; that the higher Omaha application should also be continued. The testimony of the shippers Indicated that it was very essential to their business to have some additional key points es - tablished for movements from the western part of the state, such points as Beatrice, Crawford, Northport, Sidney and Kimball, Nebraska, being some of the points which it was desired to have established as key points. Shippers also discussed, at considerable length, the relationship of the Kansas rates to Kansas City as compared with the Nebraska rates to Omaha and particularly rates in the extreme western portion of these two states, one particular phase of the discussion related to the publication of rates from points on and south of the Union Pacific in Kansas to Omaha, which were made six cents over the Kansas City rates, and the publication of rates from points on and north of the Union Pacific in Nebraska where the Kansas City rate should be six cents over the Omaha rate. Numerous other phases were discussed both by the respondents and shippers, but at this time we will not attempt to go into these questions to any great extent. The record and exhibits submitted in this case makes it almost im - possible, in view of the time limit involved, for the Commission to make as careful survey and scrutiny of the record as it would like to make </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION in order to enable it to prescribe a reasonable and proper level of rates for movements to the markets as well as movements between interior points. The Commission would also like to make a careful study of the group rates proposed by the carriers. The question of group rates will have to be dealt with at a later date. The same thing is true rela - tive to a possible revision in the rates prescribed for movement to Omaha, Nebraska. The tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Com - mission governing interstate traffic were filed with the Nebraska Com - mission about the 15th day of July, 1931, and it has been necessary to take these tariffs which carried rates from Nebraska points to Omaha, Nebraska, and Nebraska City, Nebraska, and check them against the proposed rates submitted by the carriers at the April hearing. The time allotted for the checking of these rates is very limited and a care - ful check cannot be made and still provide rates on intrastate traffic to become effective August 1, 1931. Neither do we have the time to check the milling in transit privileges, the rules and regulations govern - ing- such transit provisions, or the grain commodity lists. These rules and regulations just mentioned, will, if necessary, have to be dealt with at a later date. Time does not permit of a careful discussion of all the phases of this case and on this record we will not attempt to give a detailed discussion of our reasons for prescribing the rates found reasonable except to say that we have taken Into consideration the testimony of the carriers relating to the rate of progression between sta - tions, the cross-country competition, the gradation of rates between key - points and have attempted to avoid an abnormal step-up In the rates between any two stations. In our opinion, we feel that the shippers have justified their contentions that additional key-points should be es - tablished. We have, therefore, designated Beatrice, Gordon, Crawford, Northport and Big Springs, Nebraska, as additional key-points. The rate from Big Springs, Nebraska, to Omaha, Nebraska, has been made 20.5 cents because of the relationship existing between Venango, Ne - braska, a key-point prescribed by the Interstate Commetce Commission, on the one hand, and the territory contiguous to Big Springs, on the other. The rate at Northport has been set at 22 cents in order to relate it to the key-point rate of 22 cents prescribed for Alliance, Nebraska, the distance from this point being less than the distance from Alliance. We have set the Gordon rate at 22 cents, having established this point with the thought in mind that a movement of over 400 cars of wheat annually is entitled to a rate to the market somewhat iowc" than the Interior distance scale. Crawford will take a rate of 24 cents. This rate was set somewhat higher than 90% of the interior distance scale in order to enable the carriers to grade from this point to the state boundary lines. Beatrice has been designated a key point with a rate of 11.5 cents </seg>
            <seg id="p198">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT by reason of the fact that there are large milling interest located at that point, handling thousands of cars of grain every year. We have not set up Kimball or Sidney as key points. Neither have we prescribed any specific rates to Omaha from points in Nebraska on the Union Pacific west of Weir, Colorado. This Is an interstate movement and one over which this Commission has no jurisdiction. In our opinion, however, the rates to Omaha from these points should not exceed 22 cents although we would have no objections to the grading up of the rate beginning at the first station west of Kimball to meet the 28-cent rate at Cheyenne, Wyoming. The reason we- suggest the grade beginning beyond Kimball is because of the fact that Kimball ships over 700 cars of wheat a year and should, in our opinion, take the 22 - cent rate. We base our conclusions upon the following language of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Its supplemental decision dated April 13, 1931, page 525: ~ "Rates to Omaha 6 cents higher than to Kansas City will be required from on and south of the Union Pacific in Kansas, to correspond with the rates to Kansas City 6 cents higher than to Omaha from the North Platte region on and north of the Union Pacific in Nebraska * * *.", which we construe to mean that inasmuch as a rate of 28 cents has been established from Cheyenne to Kansas City, the Omaha rate from sta - tions in Nebraska on this line should not exceed 22 cents, or six cents under the Kansas City rate. The carriers propose oh interstate traffic from such point as Sidney, a 28-cent rate to Kansas City and a 21-cent rate to Omaha, making a spread of but four cents. From the stations north of Sidney on the Burlington up to Bonner, inclusive, the carriers are proposing 30 cents to Kansas City and 24 cents to Omaha. Here again the rate should not exceed 22 cents to Omaha and the Kansas City rate should not exceed 28 cents. Another thing we desire to point out is the proposed spread of four cents between the Kansas City and Omaha rate at Sidney, and a spread of but two cents at Kimball. Incidentally the 26-cent rate proposed at Kimball is one-half cent higher than the interior distance scale would make on the Kimball-Omaha distance. By referring to the situation in western Kansas, we find that a 22 - cent group rate has been established from the western part of Kansas extending from the Nebraska border to the Oklahoma border, whereas, in western Nebraska the only key point rate established was 22 cents at Alliance, which, incidentally, is closer to Omaha than the stations in western Kansas to Kansas City. We can see no logical reason why this same sort of an adjustment should' not apply in Nebraska from points south and north of Alliance such as Northport and Sidney to the south and Crawford to the ' north. However, we will, as heretofore stated, prescribe a 24-cent rate from Crawford to enable a gradation to be made </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION in the rates to the state boundary lines north and west of Crawtoru. We will also permit the proposed rates to go Into effect from stations on and south of Guthrie on the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. in order to enable the C. B. &amp; Q. to meet the Union Pacific interstate rates at Sidney. It Is hoped that the carriers will voluntarily make the suggested adjustments in this territory. CONCLUSIONS The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that all of the present rates on grain and. grain products should be cancelled; that the present milling in transit privileges and rules governing them, should be can - celled; that all joint line rates on grain and grain products should be cancelled; that the rates, rules and regulations, hereinafter prescribed, should be published in lieu thereof. The Commission is also of the opinion, and so finds, that the proposed interstate milling in transit privileges shall become effective on intra - state traffic, subject to complaint and revision; that the policing rules governing. such traffic, as published in Agent Boyd's Tariff 221, should be allowed to go into effect, subject to revision; that the tariff covering the list of commodities published by Agent Boyd in his tariff 220, should be allowed to go into effect, subject to revision; that the individual line' issues of the proposed transit privileges and the rules contained therein should be allowed to go Into effect, subject to revision; that the application of higher Omaha rate carried in the present tariffs should be cancelled; that the group rates, as published by the individual lines, for interstate application should be allowed to go into effect, subject to revision; that the carriers should publish a tariff providing for the application of joint line rates, based on the distance scale hereinafter prescribed in Appendix "B", such rates to be subject to the usual mill - ing in transit provisions; that the distance rates prescribed, Appendix "B", should act' as a maximum on all shipments moving within the state, whether single or joint line; (joint line rates not to be applicable over more than two lines) ; that specific rates as set up in Appendix "A" shall be published from Nebraska stations to Omaha; that the Omaha rates over the C.

RESOLUTION NO 110— SUPPLEMENT NO. 1 In the matter of prescribing conditions, rules and regulations relative to furnishing of liability insurance, surety bonds or negotiable and salable securities for "Taxicabs and Public cars"! BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING On the 9th day of July, 1929, the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion, pursuant to and in. conformity with Sections 60-201 to 60-204 in - clusive, of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, made and entered Resolution No. 110 setting forth rules, regulations and conditions rela - tive to furnishing liability insurance, surety bonds or securities for "taxi - cabs""and "public cars". (22 N. S. R. C. 456-459.) Shortly thereafter suit was instituted in the district court of Douglas County, Nebraska, to en - join said Commission from enforcing the provisions of said statute and said resolution. After trial in the district court (23 N. S. R. C. Report 306) and the appeal therefrom and a hearing in the supreme court of Nebraska, said court on June 6, 1931, rendered a decision on said case (237 N. W. Rep. Neb. 146; 24 N. S. R. C. Report page. 206) which held that the said resolu - tion and law were constitutional and enforceable against taxicabs and common carrier public cars but unconstitutional and unenforceable against cars commonly known as "rent-a-car" or "drive-it-yourself" cars. Cir - cumstances have arisen which have convinced this Commission that </seg>

BY THE COMMISSION: OPINION AND FINDING Pursuant to notice previously given, this matter came on for hear - ing on the 14th day of July, 1930, at the offices of the Commission at Lincoln. </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION This resolution entered upon its own motion by the Commission, consists of an order, directed to all carriers operating In Nebraska, to appear and show cause why the double deck rates on hogs now in effect should not be protected when a shipper orders double deck cars and as a matter of convenience to themselves the carriers furnish, in lieu Of each double deck car ordered, two single deck cars. This resolu - tion is predicated upon certain informal complaints and upon one formal complaint (No. 660) filed with the Commission relating to thi3 sub - ject. These complaints were handled with the carriers In the usual manner but they have declined to adjust the matter informally. Mr. George Hoffelder, on behalf of all roads operating in Nebraska, and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company in particular, submitted the following .testimony — that the rates in effect today to the markets, both as to state and interstate rates, are on the same scale and are the result of orders entered simultaneously by this Commission (Resolution No. 74) and the Interstate Commerce Commission (Docket 13273); that these rates together with the rules governing are now before the Interstate Commerce Commission in a proceeding under the Hoch-Smith resolution, known as I. C. C. Docket 17000, Part 9 ; that as a result of this case, the carriers expect to have a somewhat dif - ferent level of rates prescribed governed by uniform rules and practices; and in view ot this fact, nothing at this time should be done with the problem now before us; that this decision was expected to be out sometime in the fall of 1930: witness also testified as to the number of stations equipped with double deck loading chutes, the number of single and double deck cars owned, the number of requests for double deck cars received during a twelve months period; that where a reasonable .demand for double deck loading facilities exists, the carriers have at - tempted to ■ install such facilities. Mr. Hoffelder dealt with other pertinent facts relating to rates, minimum weights, car mile earnings, number of cars shipped, importance of Nebraska as a hog shipping state, absorption of switching charges, bedding charges, safety of hogs loaded in double deck cars, supply of double deck cars at various di - vision points, length of notice required for the furnishing of double deck cars and other facts surrounding the transportation of hogs in single and double deck cars. The witness in response to a question relating to the protection of the double deck rates if shippers were willing to furnish their own double deck loading facilities, indicated that they would be willing to protect those rates, and in response to a question relating to equipment stated — "We are in shape to equip a greater number of single deck cars with double deck equipment than we now have • • •.

Co. submitted evidence dealing with the situation </seg>
            <seg id="p210">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT on those lines and concurred in the testimony of Witness Hoffelder. Mr. Flansburg referred to several cases before the Interstate Commerce Commission involving the question wherein the Interstate Commerce Commission have prescribed two for one rules. This witness also showed the movement of hogs in single and double deck cars and in - dicated that it was their purpose- to furnish double deck cars every time they were ordered? that their supply of single deck cars was about the same as their supply of convertible cars (which cars can he converted into double decks without much trouble) ; that such a rule is now in effect on. the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Ry; that a reasonable time should be given the carriers for the furnishing of double deck cars and other information, similar to that of Witness Hoffelder, deal - ing with transportation of hogs in double deck cars. Mr. C. B. Steward, representing the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federa - tion, brought out the fact that the raising of stock hogs in a large sec - tion of Nebraska has developed quite materially in the last few years, and that this will also tend to increase the use of the double deck car. CONCLUSIONS From the evidence submitted, we are of the opinion and so find that at the present time there are double deck rates on hogs in effect; that when a shipper orders a double deck car for the movement of hogs those rates should be protected; that when carriers are unable to supply double deck cars for the loading of hogs and for their own convenience furnish in lieu thereof single deck cars, the double deck rates should apply, subject to the proper minimum, now carried in the tariffs, pro - vided, however that the carriers shall have at least three (3) days' notice in which to furnish such car or' cars; that the evidence presented in this case is insufficient to enable us to enter an order relative to the furnishing of double deck loading facilities at stations not now so equipped. We are also of the opinion and so find' that where shipments of hogs have moved in single deck cars, double deck cars having been ordered, carriers should protect the double deck rates and arrange to make proper refunds on such shipments. An appropriate order will he entered.

General of Nebraska, Defendants. Filed June 5, 1931 1. The state has the right to require persons engaged in the business of carrying passengers for hire in motor vehicles upon and over public streets and public highways to file "securities or insurance for the payment of judgments for death or injury to person or property caused in the operation, or by defective construction, of such motor vehicles. 2. House Roll 306 (Laws 1929, Ch. 147), together with Resolution 110 of the State Railway Commission supplemental thereto, construed to be a proper exercise of the power above set forth, and that they do not in their terms contravene section 3, art. 1, of the Constitution of Nebraska, or section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 3. The invalidity of said law, in so far as applicable to the class of cars commonly known as "drlve-it-yourself" cars, in no manner affects its validity as applied to the operation of motor vehicles engaged as "common carriers" for hire. 4. Resolution 110 adopted by the State 'Railway Commission as supplemental to House Roll 306 is not in excess of the powers vested in that, governmental agency. Heard before Goss, C.

            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION (For Resolution No. .110 see 22 Nebraska State Railway Commission Report, pages 456-469. For order of the district court of Douglas County, see 23 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Report, pages 306-307. For supplemental order No. 1 to Resolution No. 110, see pages 197-202, this report.) EBERLY, J. House Roll 306 (Laws 1929, ch. 147), entitled "An act relating to taxicabs and public cars and providing for the filing of insurance policies, surety bonds or securities with the State Railway Commission for the protection of the public; and to provide penalties for the violation thereof," was enacted by the Legislature of 1929 and duly approved by the executive on April 6 of that year. Section 1 thereof defines the terms "taxicab" and "public car." Sections 2 and 3, as a. prerequisite to the operation of a taxicab and of a public car as thus defined, require the deposit with the Nebraska State Railway Commission of "either a liability insurance policy or a surety bond with an approved surety company as surety or negotiable and salable securities" at the option of the applicant, "but which shall be approved by the Commission, in such sum and with such other terms and provisions and on such conditions as the Commission may deem necessary adequately to protect the Interest of the public having due regard for the number of persons and amount of property affected." Section 4 provides penalties for violations of its terms and also of the orders of the Nebraska State Railway Commission made pursuant there - to. This act now appears as sections 60-201. 60-202. 60-203, 60-204, Comp. St. 1929. This action to enjoin the enforcement of House Roll 306 and Reso - lution 110 adopted by the State Railway Commission supplemental there - to was thereafter commenced In the district court for Douglas county based on the alleged unconstitutionality and invalidity of such statute and order. That court on the trial found in favor of all persons engage'd In operating, renting or hiring of motor -vehicles commonly known as "drive-it-yourself" cars, and made permanent the temporary injunction theretofore granted restraining the enforcement of the statute as to such cars only, but otherwise dismissed the proceedings and dissolved the temporary injunction which had been theretofore granted restrain - ing the enforcement of the statute against taxicabs and such other "public cars" as are defined by the statute which were engaged In the business of common carriers for hire. From this final order the plaintiff and the intervener appeal. No appeal Is prosecuted by the defendants below. The appellants here contend that the statute in suit and Resolution 110 pertaining to automobiles used as common carriers are invalid as being in contravention of section 3. art. 1 of the Constitution of the </seg>
            <seg id="p214">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT state of Nebraska, and of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; that the district court erred in determining that the portion of House Roll 306 commonly known as "drive-it-yourself" cars was not an inducement to the passage of iht act; and that Resolution 110 was not within the lawful powers of ine Nebraska State Railway Commission to issue. It will be noted that ihe effect of the decree of the district court was to sustain the validitj of the act so far as it related to the business of "common carriers" as that term is defined both at common law and by our statute, section 75-401, Comp. St. 1929. It may be said generally that statutory provisions requiring those engaged in or causing the operation of motor vehicles, or certain classes of them, to furnish securities for the benefit of any person who may. be injured through negligent or faulty operation have been enacted in many states; and the decisions are uniform in upholding the power to prescribe such regulations. Commonwealth v. Slocum, 230 Mass. 180; People v. Kastings, 307 111. 92; In re Cardinal, .170 Cal. 519; Jitney Bus Ass'n. v. Wilkes-Barre, 256 Pa. St. 462; West v. Asbury Park, 89 N. J.

Unquestionably the state has the right to require persons engaged in the business . of carrying passengers for hire in motor vehicles upon public streets and public highways to file securities or insurance for the payment of judgments for death or injury to person or property caused in the operation, or by defective construction of such motor vehicles. Packard v. Banton, 264 U. S. 140; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Holyoke Street R. Co., 273 U. S. 45; Sprout v. City of South Bend, 277 U. S. 163; Lutz v. City of New Orleans, 235 Fed. 978, 237 Fed. 1018. The enforcement of House Roll 306 and Resolution 110 of the State Railway Commission, as contemplated by the decree appealed from, clearly assumes compliance with their provisions as a prerequisite to engaging in the business of "common carriers of passengers," and such being the case, under the authorities referred to, it does in no manner contravene the provisions of section 3, art. 1 of. the Nebraska Constitution or section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Consti - tution of the United States. As to the asserted fact that the requirements thus prescribed are so burdensome as to amount to a confiscation and therefore result in depriving appellant of ' his property without due process of law. the answer may be made by the following excerpt from the opinion of Suther - land, J., delivered in Packard v. Banton, 264 U. S. 140: "The fact that. </seg>
            <seg id="p215">Nebraska state railway commission because of circumstances peculiar to him, appellant may be unable to comply with the requirement as to security without assuming a burden greater than that generally borne, or excessive in itself, does not mili - tate against the constitutionality of the statute. Moreover, a distinc - tion must be observed between the regulation of an activity which may - be engaged in as a matter of right, and one carried on by government sufferance or permission. In the latter case the power to exclude al - together generally includes the lesser power to condition, and may justify a degree of regulation not admissible in the former. See Davis v. Massachusetts, 167 U. S. 43." Nor do we find that in the adoption of Resolution 110 the Nebraska State Railway Commission exceeded the powers possessed by it. The constitutional provision controlling, adopted in 1906 as a separate and independent amendment to the Constitution, created a State Railway Commission, and further provides: "The powers and duties of such Commisison shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." Const, art. 4, sec. 20. This court is committed to the view that, "In adopting the con - stitutional provision creating the State Railway Commission, it was made an independent part of the Constitution, and not as an amend - ment to the executive, legislative or judicial articles thereof." In re Lincoln Traction Co., 103 Neb. 229. The general view of the con - stitutional provision in question is well stated by Sedgewick, J„ in the same case in the following language: "Unless there has been specific legislation that might limit or affect this power given to the Commission, it would seem that the people have given this Commission all the control over common car - riers that they themselves could exercise. While this power must be exercised in harmony with the provisions of the federal Constitution, and the general provisions of our own Constitution that affect all branches of the government, it is plainly not limited by the special provisions of the Constitution which distinguish between the legislative and judicial departments of the government. The functions of this Coni - mission are largely administrative, but, as is stated in Prentis v. At - lantic Coast Line Co., supra (211 U. S. 210) the Commission necessarily has independent legislative, judicial, and executive or administrative powers." Therefore, in the light of the constitutional provisions quoted and referred to, as well as the express terms of House Roll 306, we are of the opinion that Resolution 110 was within the power of the Commis - sion to lawfully adopt and enforce. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT Nor do we entertain the view that the portions of the act in suit applicable and relating to non-common carrier vehicles or "drivo-lt - yourself" cars was an inducement to its passage and because tht-ieof the entire act must fall. "The general rule upon the subject is that where there is a con - flict between an act of the legislature and the constitution of me state, the statute must' yield to the extent of the repugnancy, but no further. (Citing cases.) If, after striking out the unconstitutional part of a statute, the residue is intelligible, complete, and capable of execu - tion, it will be upheld and enforced, except, of course in cases where it is apparent that the rejected part was an inducement to the adop - tion of the remainder. In other words the legislative will is, within constitutional limits, the law of the land, and when expressed in ac - cordance with established procedure, must be ascertained by courts and made effective." Scott v. Flowers, 61 Neb. 620, 623. Eliminating all portions of the act solely relating to "drive-lt-your - self" cars, the remainder still is Intelligible, complete and capable of execution. It therefore must be upheld and enforced. As we see no reason which would justify our accepting the view that the portion solely applicable to "drive-it-yourself" cars was an Inducement to the adoption of the residue, the remainder fully and completely covers the subject of "common carriers" as applied to the use of motor vehicles. It therefore must be .held to be a valid enactment and in full force. State v. Stuht, 52 Neb. 209; Logan County v. Carnahan, 66 Neb. 693. It therefore follows that the decree entered by the district court for Douglas county is in all respects correct, and it is AFFIRMED. Day. J., dissents. (121 Neb.

For mandate, see 22 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Report, page 477.) FINDINGS OF FACT 1. That there is diversity of citizenship and that the amount in - volved exceeds $3,000.00. 2. That the plaintiff is a part of a. railroad system known as Mis - souri Pacific Lines, operating under one management in many of the western, southwestern and southern states, and that It has and for many years last past has had In Omaha, Nebraska, an extensive ter - minal and that included in plaintiff's terminal facilities at Omaha are 15 team tracks, variously located in the eastern, northeastern, northern, northwestern, western and southwestern portions of said city. 3. That these team tracks are the private property of the plal itiff and are used and maintained for the purpose of affording a place where car -load shipments, both interstate and intrastate, can be loaded and unloaded. 4. That most, of said team tracks are located on what is commonly known in Omaha as the Belt Line, but that two of them are located on what plaintiff calls its low line, being plaintiff's branch line which" leaves Its Kansas City-Omaha main line at Auburn, Nebraska, passes through Talmage, Weeping Water, Louisville, Springfield and other Ne - braska points, joining plaintiff's main line in Omaha at what is known as West Side Junction near 48th and Leavenworth Streets in said City. 5. That said Belt Line was originally incorporated in 1883, aa a separate property, but in 1910 acquired by plaintiff's predecessor, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and thereafter double tracked and that the same is now and for many years has been an Integral part of plaintiff's line and system of railroad. . 6. That all of plaintiff's main line freight trains enter the City of Omaha and proceed to plaintiff's yards and freight house over the tracks formerly known as the Belt Line and leave the city by the same route; that all of plaintiff's branch line freight trains traverse, reach and- leave the yards and freight depot via West Side Junc - tion and that part of the so-called Belt Line north thereof, and that for many years plaintiff's branch line passenger trains took the same route, but that in recent years it has become the practice to load and unload said passenger trains at the said West Side Junction; and that ever since the acquisition of said Belt Line property by plaintiff's predecessor in 1910 no distinction has been made between the same and any other part of plaintiff's or its predecessor's property. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT 7. That prior to April 1, 1923, shippers on other railroads had been able to have intrastate carload shipments delivered on plaintiff's team tracks at Omaha, plaintiff company making a charge for the switching service incident to moving the car from the transfer track of the road having the line haul, to the particular team track where delivery was desired. Other railroads entering Omaha did not afford similar service to shippers whose industries were located on plaintiff's lines outside of Omaha. 8. On or about May 2, 1923, plaintiff company attempted to bring itself in line with the' practice of the other roads entering Omaha, and filed an application with the Nebraska State Railway Commission asking permission to have incorporated in its Nebraska ' Tariffs the following: "Team tracks of the Missouri 'Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska are for its sole use and switching service from or to such tracks will not be performed for connecting railroads." (Plaintiff's team track service on interstate shipments had always been and still is in line with the above rule and in that respect was the same as other railroads.) 9. Plaintiff's application was granted and the new Tariff went into effect thirty days after May 2, 1923, and continued in effect until August 19, 1924. In the. meantime, shortly prior to September 27, 1923, one Trenmor Cone filed a complaint with the Nebraska State Railway Commission and on September 27, 1923, pursuant thereto, the Railway Commission issued an order to the plaintiff, directing plaintiff to appear on October 23, 1923, and show cause why the order permitting the tariffs to be amended in accordance with the above quoted rule should not be cancelled. (16 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Rep. 417). To this order to show cause plaintiff filed an answer, In which it alleged that to compel plain - tiff to give team track service to shippers in cases where the plaintiff did not have the line haul, and to compel plaintiff to switch cars for a switching charge from connecting lines to Its team tracks, would take plaintiff's property in violation of Articles V and XIV of the Amend - ments to the Constitution of the United States, but plaintiff did not specifically allege in its answer in said proceeding that the reason way such action would take plaintiff's property .without due process ot law and would deny plaintiff the equal protection of the laws was because such action would be In violation of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution and the Transportation Act of 1920; and plaintiff did not specifically allege In said answer that Congress by the Transportation Act of 1920 had entered the field of team track regulation to the exclusion of the several states, and that under said Transportation Act one carrier could be compelled to turn over its team tracks to the use of another carrier only when the Interstate Commerce Commission found that such </seg>
            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION action would be in the public interest and practicable without sub - stantially impairing the ability of the carrier owning the terminal facil - ities to handle its own business. 10. Thereafter the complainant, Trenmor Cone, filed a reply to the answer of this plaintiff and upon a hearing the Nebraska State Railway Commission made an order, effective April 1, 1924, cancelling the above quoted tariff provision, which order, upon a re-hearing, was adhered to August 19, 1924. (17 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Rep. 532-543.) 11. Thereafter this plaintiff appealed from the decision of the Rail - way Commission to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, which court affirmed the decision of the - Railway Commission, Missouri P. R. Corporation v. Nebraska State Railway Commission, 115 Nebr. 856; 20 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Rep. 534-537. 12. Plaintiff herein then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and that court, after argument by counsel, dismissed the writ of error for want of jurisdiction, the opinion stating that "The Writ of Error is dismissed for want of a properly presented substantial federal question." 13. That 'the general custom and practice in this section of the country is for railroad companies to decline to permit connecting lines to use their team tracks for deliveries on which the connecting com - pany has the line haul, and that this applies both to interstate and intrastate shipments, 14. That except in the case of the plaintiff, Missouri Pacific Rail - road Corporation in Nebraska, there is no tariff provision in force on . intrastate shipments, imposing upon any of the railroads entering Omaha the obligation of permitting delivery upon its team tracks of a shipment arriving over the line of some other road. 15. That on the contrary, except In Infrequent and isolated in - stances where the circumstances are unusual, the other roads entering Omaha" decline to accept from foreign lines cars for team track de - livery and their tariffs so provide. ' 16. That the articles of incorporation or articles of association filed by the incorporators of the Omaha Belt Railway Company with the county clerk and secretary of state in 1883, did not require or state that that company would furnish team track delivery or loading service for all or any other roads entering Omaha. 17. That there was nothing in either of these documents which imposed upon subsequent owners of the property the duty and obligation of switching cars from connecting carriers to team tracks on said property. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPOR1 18. That what was formerly the Omaha Belt Railway, is now and ever since 1910 has been a part and parcel of the main trunk line of the Missouri Pacific 1 Railroad Corporation In Nebraska (formerly Mis - souri Pacific Railway Company). 19. That most of the commerce moving in and out of the Omaha terminal over what was formerly the single track Omaha Belt Railway and is now the double" track main line of the plaintiff, and most of the shipments set out on the team tracks there involved, are interstate in character, not to exceed 10% of said commerce being intrastate in char - acter. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. That the decision by the Supreme Court of Nebraska, in the case of Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation, appellant, vs. Nebraska State Railway Commission, appellee, 115 Nebr. 856, is res judicata- upon the several matters and issues presented in this case. 2. That no substantial change of circumstances has occurred since the decision by the Supreme Court of Nebraska in Missouri Pacific Rail - road Corporation vs. Nebraska State Railway Commission, 115 Nebr. 856, which entitles the plaintiff to the relief asked in this case. It is therefore ordered and decreed that plaintiff's bill be dismissed at its costs. An exception is allowed as to each finding and conclusion herein.

No. 27888 ' Filed November 5. 1931 A through or joint freight rate over two lines of railway, jointly established and put Into effect, pursuant to an order of the State Rail - way Commission, cannot be modified or abrogated by the establishment of a terminal switching charge, .which is subject to absorption by the initial carrier, where such switching charge is established on an ex parte application by one of the carriers without notice to the other. (Appealed from an order of the Commission in Formal Complaint No. 665, see 23 Nebraska State Railway Commission Report, pages 153-157.) Heard before Goss, C. J., Rose, Dean, Good, Eberly, Day and Paine, J J. GOOD, J. This appeal is from an order entered by the State Railway Commis - sion, directing defendant to refund to plaintiff certain alleged over - charges for freight on 22 car lots of gravel, shipped by plaintiff from its gravel pit In Saunders county to DeBolt Place in Douglas county, oyer defendant's line of railway to Omaha and thence over the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway to DeBolt Place. Defendant appeals. The rate exacted by defendant was 5% cents per cwt. Defendant contends that this rate was lawfully established by the Railway Com - mission as a joint haul rate for gravel over the two lines of railway, and was in force and effect at the time the shipment in question moved. Plaintiff contends that the lawful ■ freight rate on gravel from its pit to Omaha was three cents per cwt., that the connecting carrier was entitled to a switching charge of $12 per car from Omaha to DeBolt Place, which charge defendant was required to absorb, and that this rate, and not the joint haul rate, was the one applicable to the shipments in question. From the record it appears that at the time of, and many years prior to, the movement of the cars in question, DeBolt Place was desig - nated on the distance charts of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company as one of Its stations, about seven miles distant from the Omaha station, and that at the time of the shipments here involved DeBolt Place was not within, but was a considerable distance beyond, the limits of the switch yards of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company at Omaha. It appears that the cars in question were trans- </seg>
            <seg id="p222">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT ported from Omaha to DeBolt Place by the latter railway company in its - regular trains, and over its main-line track. The 5%-cent rate on gravel between plaintiff's pit and DeBolt Place by way of Omaha was the regular established rate, at least until the latter road, upon its applica - tion, procured from the Railway Commission an. order providing for a $12 switching charge from its station in Omaha to DeBolt Place. This latter order, providing for a switching charge, Was made without notice to the defendant. It also appears that the rate on gravel from plaintiffs gravel pit to Omaha by way of defendant's railway was three cents per cwt., and that there was a provision also for absorption of switch - ing charges when the car was destined to an industry on the switches of a connecting carrier at Omaha. That order provided for the absorp - tion of the switching charge, .provided that it left the initial carrier $18.50 per car for its freight charge. The plaintiff's contention is that this 3-cent rate was the one in force and that the defendant company was required to absorb the switch - ing charge made by the connecting carrier. Defendant apparently con - cedes that, if the order providing for the $12 switching charge is valid and binding upon it, then the 3-cent rate should prevail and the order entered by the Railway Commission in this case is proper and valid. The real question for determination, therefore, is: May a through or joint rate over two lines of railway, jointly established and put into effect, pursuant to an order of the Railway Commission, be modified or abrogated by the establishment of a terminal switching charge which is subject to absorption by the initial carrier, and where such switching charge is established' on an ex parte application of one of the carriers without notice to the other? Section 75-408, Comp. St. 1929, authorizes the State Railway Com - mission to establish through joint rates for the shipment of freight and cars over two or more connecting lines of railway in this state, and further provides that in the making thereof and in changing or revising the same they shall be governed, as nearly as may be, by the provisions of article IV of said chapter 75, with reference to original schedules of rates and tariffs for railway companies and common carriers. By refer - ence to section 75-402,' Comp. St. 1929, we find that the Commission is authorized to alter, change, amend or abolish any classification or rate, when deemed necessary, and that such amended, altered or new classifi - cations or rates shall be put into effect in the same manner as th~e originals, and in so doing the Commission is required to fix a time and place for a hearing and to give the railway company or common earner, to be affected thereby, ten days' notice thereof. Any railway company or common carrier shall be entitled to be heard at such time and place; to the end that justice shall be done. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Section 75-712, Comp. St. 1929, makes it unlawful for any railway company or common carrier to change any rate, schedule, or classifica - tion until application has been made to the Railway Commission and permission had for that purpose. For a violation,- the carrier is sub - jected to a penalty not exceeding $10,000. Section 75-501 provides for a revision or modification of the rates charged, but only upon a hearing before the Commission, with due notice to the common carriers affected. Section 75-505 provides that if the railway company or common carrier, or other person affected by the order made, shall be dissatisfied with the decision made by the Commission an appeal may be had to this court to review its action. If the order of the Railway Commission, fixing the $12 switching charge via Chicago &amp; North Western railway from Omaha to DeBolt Place is valid, and if. such switching charge must be absorbed by de - fendant on gravel shipments from plaintiff's pit to DeBolt Place via Omaha, then it is clear that such an order abrogates and cancels the former joint rate of 5% cents and establishes a new joint rate of three cents per cwt. In McCaffrey Bros. Co. v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., 114 Neb. 382, 207 N. W. 503, it was held: "A freight rate once lawfully established continues to be the legal rate until legally canceled. Subsequent tariffs naming new rates, without canceling previous rates, cannot carry the new rate into lawful effect." To the same effect are Knight v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., 114 Neb. 387, 207 N. W. 505, -and Knight v.. Chicago B. &amp; Q. R. Co., 114 Neb. 388, 207 N. W. 506. In Southern Roads Co. v. Galveston, H. &amp;■ S. A. R. Co., 140 I. C. C. 413, It was. In effect, held that, so far as the shipping public is con - cerned, the effect of requiring the absorption of a switching charge is to establish a joint rate. In Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. R. Co. v. State of Minnesota, 134 U S. 418, 33 L. Ed. 970. in the body of the opinion It was said (p. 457) : "No hearing is provided for, no summons or notice to the company before the commission has found what it is to find and declared what it is to declare, no opportunity provided for the company to introduce witnesses before the commission, in fact, nothing which has the semblance of due process of law." In Central of Georgia R. Co. v. Georgia R. Commission, 215 Fed. 421, it was held: "Notice and hearing are necessary to the validity of an action by the Georgia Railroad Commission, changing a freight classification of a railroad company' doing business within the state, so as to reduce its freight rates, under authority conferred by the Georgia Railroad Commission Law." With . respect to the manner of making and changing rates, the law of Georgia seems to be quite similar to that of Nebraska. In Silica Sand Producers' Traffic Ass'n. v.. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., 73 I. C. C. 588, it was held, in effect, that a joint rate </seg>
            <seg id="p224">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT . may not be established, modified or canceled unless all the carrier parties to the joint rate are parties to the proceeding. As heretofore noted, in the instant case the $12 switching charge from Omaha to DeBolt Place purported to be effective without notice to the defendant. Under the authorities cited, it is apparent that the order of the Commission, establishing the $12 switching charge, is not binding upon the defendant. It may be observed that, if the Commission could establish a switching charge to a regular station, it might also extend it, not only to the first station, but to the second or third or still farther station, and would thereby abrogate and cancel existing joint rates. But such joint rates may not be canceled or modified except upon a hearing, with notice to all carriers affected thereby. It follows that the order entered by the Commission in this case,' directing a refund, is erroneous and is hereby reversed, and plaintiffs complaint dismissed.. . . REVERSED AND DISMISSED. (121 Neb. Rep. 855) OPINIONS BY ATTORNEY GENERAL C. A. SORENSEN AND HIS STAFF In addition to participating in the Interstate Commerce Commission cases shown in Part I, the Attorney General's office furnished the Com - mission with the following opinions on general questions of law: Sometime since I wrote you a memorandum opinion on the ques - tions submitted by you to Chairman Randall of the State Railway Com - mission. I suggested that if you had authorities on the subject, you submit them. I also wrote you on December 10th, concerning the mat - ter. As I have not heard from you I am giving you the opinion of this department, as follows: Your Inquiries, as understood by this department, are as follows: (1) Has the Nebraska State Railway Commisison jurisdiction to order a railroad company to make a refund of the cost of an industry track on the ground that the contract for the construc - tion of said track is inequitable, and, because, while the track was originally constructed for the use of the industry, it is now used more by the company for the storage of cars than by the industry? (2) May the industry maintain an action for the recovery of the expenditure? The first question must be answered in the negative. Such a claim, if entertained by the Commission, would call into action equity power which the Commission does not possess. Section 510, chapter 75, Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION piled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, relates only to reparation on ac - count of excessive freight charges. It does not cover a claim of this nature. The second question must also be answered in the negative. Un - der the terms of the agreement entered into between the industry and the railroad company, dated July 19, 1919, the railroad company has the right (paragraph VI of the contract) to use the track for railroad purposes. It does not appear from the statement that the railroad is making a use of the track inconsistent with the use of the track by the industry. Under the Interstate Commerce Act, section 1, paragrapE 22, authority over industrial tracks, side track, etc., is in the state. Under the Equal Facilities Act, chapter 74, sections 501 et seq.. Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, provision is made for apportioning the cost of construction ot side tracks and their maintenance. It pro - vides that when a person, desiring a side .track, shall feel dissatisfied with the amount that the railroad company requires to be paid for the construction of such track he may file a petition in the district court to have the reasonableness of the charges judicially determined. Under this' statute, the parties may make a binding agreement in relation to the. cost of the construction and maintenance. Relief from such a con - tract can only be obtained In a judicial proceeding and on some equitable ground. Further, the agreement Is more than eleven years old, and any -claim for refund thereunder, unless on the ground of improper use of the track, is long since barred by the statute of limitations. To the following question, propounded by the Commission, to-wit: "May the Commission allow interest on an award for repara - tion when the complainant does not specifically pray for Interest in his complaint?" this department gives the following answer: Under Code ot Civil Procedure, chapter 20, section 804, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, It is provided that a petition in the dis - trict court must, if the recovery of money be demanded, state the amount thereof, and if any interest thereon be claimed, the time from which interest is to be computed. In the case of Higgins v. Case Threshing Machine Co., 95 Neb. 3, it was held that under the code provision cited above, "where the plaintiff in an action. does not pray for interest, none can be recovered". Under Rule XVI of this Commission, it is provided that the Commis - sion will be governed by the practice which obtains in the district courts </seg>
            <seg id="p226">TWENTT-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT of Nebraska, so far as the same is applicable under the rules. The rule appears to apply, and it is the opinion of this department that interest should not be allowed. The rule appears, however, to be unnecessarily stringent and it is suggested that it be modified. Reparation claims are usually presented by shippers and not by attorneys, the claims being so small as frequently not to justify the employment of attorneys. It is not perceived tnat injustice could result to anyone If the rule were changed so as to permit the allowance of Interest although not prayed for In the complaint. This department has given consideration to the question submitted by the rate department of the State Railway Commission, based upon communication from D. H. Merritt &amp; Sons of Lincoln, who ask that an interchange track be constructed between the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad and the Missouri Pacific Railroad at Oreapolis, Nebraska, in order to permit the handling of sand and gravel from pits owned by Merritt &amp; Sons to destinations on the Missouri Pacific. The question submitted by the rate department is whether or not the Nebraska State Railway Commission has authority to require the establishment of track connections between the line of interstate carriers. The Nebraska statute, Chapter 74, Section 564, requires all railroad companies to provide track connections. Paragraph 3 of Article III of the Interstate Commerce Act, U. S. C. Title 49, provides as follows: "All carriers, engaged in the transportation of passengers or property, subject to the provisions of this chapter, shall, according to their respective powers, afford all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the Interchange of traffic between their respective lines, and for the receiving, forwarding, and delivering of pas - sengers or property to and from their several lines and those con - necting therewith, and shall not discriminate in their rates, fares, and charges between such connecting lines, or unduly prejudice any such connecting line, in the distribution of traffic that is not spe - cifically routed by the shipper." There is inconsistency between the state statute and Federal statute. Lake Erie, A. &amp; W. R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (Ohio) 141 N. E. 847, holds as follows: (syllabus) "Where a railroad engaged in interstate and intrastate com - merce invokes the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission for an order requiring another railroad likewise engaged in interstate and intrastate commerce to join in making a physical connection between the two lines, pursuant to paragraph 3, sec - tion 3, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Trans - portation Act of February, 1929, (U. S. Comp. St. Supp. 1923, para. 8565, sec. 3), and before final determination thereof such applicant road, without dismissing such proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission, makes application to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for exactly the same connection, and secures </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the same in so far as intrastate commerce is concerned, and there - after the Interstate Commerce Commission, whose jurisdiction was first invoked,- having fully heard the original application, denies the same upon grounds affecting both interstate and intrastate commerce, held, under such circumstances the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission is exclusive and the Public Util - ities Commission of Ohio was without jurisdiction to grant such order." ' In People ex rel. New York Central Railroad Co. v. Public Service Commission, 233 N. Y. 113, 135 N. E. 195, it is held: (syllabus) "1. State authorities cannot compel interstate carriers to make physical connections between their tracks for interchange of traffic, notwithstanding the Federal Transportation Act pro - vides that the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall not extend to the construction of spur. Industrial, team, switching, or side tracks located wholly within a state. "2. A statute requiring a common carrier to afford reason - able facilities for interchange of traffic between Its lines and those of other carriers, but providing that the statute shall not be con - strued to require a common carrier to permit or allow any other carrier to use its tracks or terminal facilities, does not empower the Public Service Commission to require, the road to make track connections and lay switches and sidings for interchange of freight care. "3. A statute requiring every common carrier to receive from every other common carrier freight cars at a connecting point and haul them through to destination, but providing that they shall not be required to permit or allow any other common carrier to use their tracks or terminal facilities, does not empower the Pub - lic Service Commission to compel carriers to make road connec - tions at places not connecting points." See also People ex rel.. New York Central v. Public Service Commis - sion, (N. Y.) 134 N. E. 590; same case, 259 U. S. 621, 66 L. Ed. 795. Under the authorities cited above, it Is the opinion of this depart - ment that the State Railway Commission has not jurisdiction to require track connection between interstate carriers, that Congress has legis - lated upon the subject, and that, the Interstate Commerce Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to require the construction of such connections. It must not be assumed from what is said that the State Railwaj Commission has no jurisdiction of the operation of such facilities, when constructed, so far as they relate to intrastate commerce. . The Commission has. submitted to this department an inquiry of Mr. A. W. Felger of Norfolk, concerning liability under bus insurance policies. </seg>
            <seg id="p228">TWENTY' -FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT The circumstances leading to the inquiry by Mr. Felger may be ' stated as follows:' A passenger upon a bus, covered by an insurance policy approved by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, had with him baggage which was lost in transit. After several days It was re - covered. It does not appear that It was damaged. The passenger makes claim for two days' time lost while waiting for the recovery of the baggage which contained certain samples which he used in selling goods. The question presented is whether or not the liability of the bus operator is covered by the insurance policy. The policy (Maryland Casualty Company Policy No. P-4226) is taken as typical of such policies. The provisions of the policy relating to this subject, are as follows: "I. The Company shall only be liable under that Clause or those Clauses of the following Insuring Clauses, as regards each automobile listed and described, for which a specific premium charge is set forth in Statement III (a) hereof, and subject thereto the insurance granted is as follows: * * * "CLAUSE B. Against loss from liability imposed by law upon the assured for damage to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, resulting from accident occurring within the Policy term. By reason of the ownership, maintenance or use of any automobile described in Statement III (a) ; "Excluding, however, (a) property owned, rented or leased by the Assured; (b) property In the custody of the Assured, other than property of a passenger for which the Assured is legally , responsible; (c) property carried in or upon any automobile in - sured hereunder, .other than property of a passenger if the in - sured automobile is described as a public passenger automobile. "The Company's limit of liability, regardless of the number of Assureds named In Statement I, for damage to or destruction of property of one person or more than one person in any one accident, including resultant loss ot use, shall be. the amount ex - pressed in State III (h) ; and said limit shall apply to each automo - bile insured hereunder." There is a specific premium charge on account of Clause B, under the heading "Property Damage", set forth under Statement III (a). The Nebraska endorsement for insurance policies covering busses, as required by the Railway Commission, which endorsement is attached to and made a part of the policy, contains the following: "4. It is understood and agreed that the 'Property Damage' Agreement of the printed policy is amended to read that the com - pany will pay on account of accidents coming within the policy provisions and within the limit specified In the policy, the loss from the liability imposed by law upon the assured for damage to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof except - ing property of the assured and /or property in the custody of the </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION assured and /or property which is rented or leased, and /or prop - erty carried in or upon any automobiles of the assured, other than property of a passenger." It is the opinion of' this department that the policy covers only destruction of property or damage thereto, including the loss of the use thereof resulting from an accident that causes either destruction or damage; that it does not apply to loss resulting from the loss ot the baggage when there is neither destruction nor physical damage. This construction of- the policy results from the use of the woids "destruction and damage" In Clause B, above quoted, of Paragraph I; from the use of the same words in Paragraph 4 of the Nebraska en - dorsement, also quoted above; from the use of the term "Property Dam - age" in Statement III, and from the general statements throughout the policy, indicating that it refers to an accident wherefrom physical injury results. Whether or not the damage must be Incidental to an accident to the bus itself, in order to permit recovery under the policy, has not been considered, and no opinion is expressed thereon. Y'our inquiry as to the validity of Ordinance No. 13950 of the city of Omaha, under the terms of which the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company is required to equip and operate an additional motor bus line upon certain designated streets, as part of its street railway system, has been given consideration. Under the constitution. Article IV, Sec. 20, the State Railway Com - mission is given plenary jurisdiction over all common carriers, except as it may be restricted by specific legislation. That section of the con - stitution reads, in part, as follows: . . "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common car - riers as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." The general power ot the State Railway Commission over common carriers is amplified in the statutory provisions. Sec. 75-201, Comp. Stat. Nebr., 1929, is as follows: "The Commission shall have the power to regulate the rates ' and services of, and to exercise a general control over all i all - roads, express companies, car companies, sleeping car companies, freight and freight line companies, and all other common carriers engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers within the state." Common carriers are defined by Sec. 75-401, Comp. Stat, of Nebr., 1929, as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p230">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT u ■' •' * "The term 'railway company' as used herein shall be taken to include all corporations, companies, individuals and associa - tions of individuals, their lessees or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever that may now or hereafter own, operate, manage or control any railroad or part of a railroad in this state, and all corporations, companies and associations of individuals, their les - sees or receivers, as shall do the business of common carriers or any railroad in this state. The term 'common carriers' as used herein shall be taken to include all corporations, companies, in - dividuals and association of individuals, their lessees- or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever, that may now or hereafter own, operate, manage or control any railroad, interurban or street rail - way line, operated either by steam or electricity or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express company, car com - pany, sleeping car company, freight and freight line company, tele - graph and telephone companies and any other carrier engaged in the transmission of messages, or transportation of passengers or freight for hire." • The term "street railway" is defined and motor busses to be used as auxiliary or supplementary means of transportation to any street car system, are covered by Sec. 74-1101, Comp. Stat, of Nebr., 1929. The section just above quoted was enacted in 1925 and appears in Laws of 1925, p. 150. The date is important as it was long subsequent to the adoption of the constitutional amendment relating to municipal charters. Const. Art. XI, Sections 2-5 inclusive, relating to municipal charters will be referred to later. It has been repeatedly held by the Supreme Court of this state that street railways are under the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commis - sion and that it is a duty of the Commission to regulate such services. In Herpolsheimer v. Lincoln Traction Co., 96 Neb. 154, it is said:. "There is no doubt that the building and operation of a street railway line through the city affects the values of property in the vicinity, and the financial interests of the citizens, as well as their convenience and other interests. Substantial changes in the service may affect those values and interests either favorably or unfavorably. It is alleged that the principal stockholders and of - ficers of the defendant railway company are largely interested in property and different lines of business In the city, and that the proposed changes of the routing of the street cars, and other pro - posed changes in the service, are for the - benefit and in the In - terests of those officers and directors, and not in the interest nor for the benefit of the public at large, and that such changes would be highly injurious to the property and business of these plain - tiffs, as well as to the value of the property and the interests of the interveners who reside upon, or in the vicinity of, the Twelfth street line. When such changes are made they should be made in the interest of the public generally, and the rights of the street railway company, the economy and efficiency of the service, and the interests of the citizens whose property rights and convenience are especially affected, should all be considered. Contracts between individuals and public service companies which. are for their bene- </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION fit alone should also be considered, so far as those contracts do not interfere with the superior rights of the general public. There is no doubt that such matters are within the purview of the con - stitutional provision and the statute above quoted, which provide that the state railway commission shall have power to regulate the service and control common carriers of passengers. It ap - pears that changes of this kind have been made by the street rail - way company, and that such changes have been by the&gt; company reported to the State Railway Commission from time to time, but it does not appear that these changes were authorized by the State Railway Commission, nor that any application has been made to that Commission for authority to make such changes. The power to regulate rates of common carriers would be Incomplete and comparatively useless without the. corresponding power to regulate the service, and control the common carrier in performing such service, and these powers are expressly given to the State Rail - way Commission by the terms of the constitution, and the statute enacted thereunder. It seems clear that these provisions prevent the defendant from making such changes in the service without first obtaining the authority of the State Railway Commission so to do." In, In re Lincoln Traction Co., 103 Nebr. 229, report said: "Unless there has been specific legislation that might limit or affect this power given to the Commission, it would seem that the people have given this Commission all the control over com - mon carriers that they themselves could exercise." See also Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs St. Ry. Co. v. Nebraska State Rail - way Commission, 103 Nebr. 695. Unless there Is something In the constitutional provision relating to municipal charters, Art. XI, Sections 2-5 inclusive, that modified Sec. 20 of Art. IV of the constitution above quoted, it is obvious that the State Railway Commission has full jurisdiction to the exclusion of all municipal authority. Attention is- called to the language of Section 2, just referred to. It is in part as follows: "Any city having a popula - tion of more than five thousand (5,000) inhabitants may frame a charter for its own government, consistent with and subject to the constitution and laws of this state. * * *." Section 5 it will be noted was adopted in 1920. "The charter of any city having a population ot more than one hundred thousand inhabitants may be adopted as the home rule charter of such city by a majority vote of the qualified electors of such city voting upon the question, and when so adopted may thereafter be changed or amended as provided in Section 4 of this article, subject to the constitution and laws of the state." In this connection Sec. 74-1104, Comp. Stat, of Nebr., 1929, which relates to the granting of street rail - way franchises, should be considered. It is in-part as follows: "The terms and provisions of any such consent shall not be in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of the laws of the state, either as respects the rights to be acquired by such con - sent, or as respects any measure of jurisdiction and control over </seg>
            <seg id="p232">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT rates, fares and service, as may be vested in the State Railway Commission or other appropriate regulatory body." The section just quoted was enacted in 1925, Laws of Nebraska, 1925, Page 152. The Supreme Court of this state has frequently expressed itself as to the relation between the municipal charter provisions of the con - stitution and the statutes relating to purely municipal affairs on the one hand, and the general provisions of the constitution and general statutes on the other. In Schroeder v. Zehrung, 108 Nebr. 573, report said: "The city of Lincoln has adopted a home rule charter pur - suant to the provisions of article XI of the state Constitution. Section 2 of that article provides, among other things: 'Any city having a population of more than- five thousand (5,000) inhabitants may frame a charter for its own government, consistent with and subject to the constitution and laws of this state,.* * * and if a majority of such qualified voters, voting thereon, shall ratify the same, it shall at the end of sixty days thereafter become the charter of said city, and supersede any existing charter and all amendments thereof.' Plaintiff insists that under this constitu - tional provision the city is still governed by the provisions of the legislative charters under which it was previously governed. We are not inclined to this view. If a city, after having adopted a home rule charter, was still to be subject to all the provisions ot the former legislative charters, there could be no object or purpose in adopting a home rule charter. While a home rule charter adopt - ed pursuant to the constitutional provision may not contravene any provisions of the constitution or of any general statute enacted by the legislature, it is, in all other respects, binding and control - ling. A city may enact and put into Its charter any provision for its government that it deems proper, so long as they do not run contrary to the Constitution or to any general statute." In Consumers Coal Co. v. City of Lincoln, 109 Nebr. 51, the language of Schroeder v. Zehrung, supra, is approved (55). The Court said: "We have recently held In Schroeder v. Zehrung, 108 Neb. 573, that 'a city may enact and put into such charter any. provisions for its government that it deems proper, so long as they do not run contrary to the constitution or any general statute.' " See also Std. Oil Co. v. City of Lincoln, 114 Nebr. 243. Both Schroe - der y. Zehrung, supra, ahd Consumers Coal Co. v. City of Lincoln, supra, are quoted approvingly and the holdings are expressly confirmed. See also, Salsbury v. City of Lincoln, 117 Nebr. 465. Sandell v. City of Omaha, 115 Nebr. 861. As the constitutional provision granting power to the State Railway Commission was not modified by the municipal charter provisions of the constitution, but was distinctly recognized by the latter; and as gen - eral statutes, as above cited, have been- enacted subsequently to the </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION adoption of the municipal charter provisions. It Is plain that there was no intent either on the part of the makers of the constitution, or on the part of the legislators in any way to limit or lessen the power of the State Railway Commission over street railway companies. The State Railway Commission has at all times treated its juris - diction as unaffected by the charter provisions of the city of Omaha. In its order of June 16, 1930, fixing rates, it said: "The added revenue which such increased fares may produce will hardly exceed applicant's annual interest charges, and, in all probability, will afford very little. If any, return to the stocknold - ers of applicant, notwithstanding the annual saving in operating expenses hereafter in the amount of $125,000.00 annually by reason of purchasing its power under contract. The rates approved in the order are ba'sed upon the absolute necessities of the present situa - tion. The Commission will follow the case closely to the end that best possible service to the patrons may be given in return for the fare authorized. We, therefore, deem it advisable that in the future no service changes be made involving substantial in - creases in operating costs or capital investments, without such changes having been first approved by this Commission." 23 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Report 256 (261).. It is therefore the opinion of this department that the ordinance. City of Omaha, No. 13950, is ineffectual and that the power of the Com - mission must first be invoked before there can be any increase in the service offered. Your inquiry of July 29 as to how many certified copies of an order of the State Railway Commission should be sent, free of charge, to an interested party in any hearing before the Commission has been given attention. It is the opinion of this department that an interested party may demand only one certified copy. Section 75-402, Compiled Statutes' of Nebraska, 1929, uses the plural, but" evidently with the intention that only one copy should be mailed to each interested carrier. Sections 75-504 and 75-507 indicate that only one copy should be mailed. It is within the discretion of the Commission, however, to provide, by rule, for the sending of additional free copies. (Upon motion, the Secretary was Instructed to furnish one certified copy of each order to each interested carrier or party in interest -in each case wherein an order is issued by this Commission.) Your question concerning the Farmer's Union Cooperative Associa - tion of Kimball, Nebraska, has been given attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p234">TWENTY-FOUR1H ANNUAL REPORT The association has not secured a grain warehouse license. In the letter ot the association, dated August 15, 1931, the following appears: "In reply to your letter of August 10, 1931, we wish to advise you that we are not storing grain at our elevator, for members or non-members. A few of our customers have taken the ten days in which to establish a price. We have made the proposition to some that they can take the ten days, and if not satisfied with the price we are paying then they can settle on a future date, by deciding on the future basis provided: That they leave the cash credit at the end of ten day period for margin on their wheat. To date no one has been able to do this for they need their money. We are not encoui ag - ing them to do this." The statute (Section I, House Roll No. 282, approved April 18, 1931) Sec. 88-219, Sup. to Comp. Stat. 1929, is in part as follows: "Any grain elevator or grain warehouse in which grain is held in storage for a period longer than ten days is hereby declared a public warehouse within the meaning of this act, and any grain which has been received at any grain elevator or grain warehouse for which actual sale price has not been fixed within ten days after the receipt of the same is hereby held in storage." It will be observed that the actual sale price must be fixed within the ten-day period. Under the plan of the cooperative association the price is not to be fixed until some future date. The fact that the cash credit at the end of the ten-day period must be left as a margin on the grain demonstrates the fact that the sale price has not been fixed. It is the opinion of this department that in pursuing the method outlined by the company, It Is within the warehouse law and must take out a license. The inquiry of the State Railway Commission, submitted yesterday, concerning the objection to jurisdiction in the case of Frank R. Wakefield v. Dundy County Mutual. Telephone Company, Formal Complaint No. 696, has been considered. It is alleged in the complaint that the telephone system of the defendant at Benkelman was In such condition in March, 1926, that in order to secure proper service the complainant was obliged to install desk set, at his place of business, at his own expense. The company removed its wall phone when he put in the desk set. He has also pro - vided the necessary batteries at his own expense.

            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION rental value of the desk set for a period of about five and one-half years Is $16.10. The prayer of the complaint Is as follows: "Wherefore plaintiff prays that the defendants - may be re - quired to answer the charges herein and after due hearing and investigation an order be made commanding the defendant to re - imburse plaintiff for the present value of said desk telephone and further reimburse plaintiff for past due rentals on said telephone in the sum of $16.10, and for such order and further relief as may be necessary and proper in the premises." It is not alleged that there is any contract by the terms of which the company agrees to take over the desk set. It is the opinion of this department that the State Railway Com - mission is without jurisdiction to hear and determine the complaint The prayer consists of two parts: ' One, to require the defendant to take over the desk set and reimburse the complainant for his outlay which is in the nature of an action for specific performance. It is a purely judicial proceeding and it would be necessary for the complain - ant to resort to the courts for relief. The second part of the prayer seems to be based on the idea that the defendant has collected excessive rates, in view of the furnishing of the transmitter and receiver by the complainant, and that therefore the State Railway Commission can award reparation. Section 75-510, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, providing for reparation Is as follows : "That if, after hearing on a complaint under sections 6126, 6127, 6128. 6129 or sections 6137, 6138, 6139, 6140, revised statutes of Nebraska for 1913, (75-501 to 75-504, 75-506 to 75-509), the Ne - braska State Railway Commission shall determine that any party complainant has on and after the taking effect of this Act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint paid unjust or unreasonable rates or charges to any defendant railroad or express company in this state or intrastate traffic or has on and after the taking effect of this act and within two years next- preceding the. filing of the said complaint suffered damages by reason of the maintaining, publishing, demanding, charging, or receiving or retaining by such carrier of any rate or rates, charges rules, regulations, services or practices on intrastate traffic which are found by the Commission to be unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential or otherwise unlawful, the Com - mission shall make an order directing the railroad or express com - pany to pay to the complainant the sum to which he is entitled on or before a day named. (1921 p. 280; C. S. 1922, 5500)". While there are provisions in some of the sections (75-501, etc.) enumerated in Section 75-510, relating to common carriers generally, It is to be observed that Section 75-510 specifically names railroads find express companies. Section 75-511 provides in part as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p236">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT "If a railroad or express company does not comply with an order of the Commission for the payment of money within the time limit in such order, the complainant, or any person for whose benefit such order was made, may file in the district court for the district in which he resides or in any. district through which the railroad or express company runs, or in any state court having jurisdiction of the parties, a petition setting forth briefly the cause or causes for which he claims* damages, and the order of the Commission in the premises." As reparation is only provided for by the. statute, as against rail - roads and express companies, the power of the Railway Commission cannot be enlarged by inference to include telephone companies. As the Commission is without jurisdiction to determine the matter, the objection should be sustained. Your letter of inquiry of September 15, addressed to the State Rail - way Commission, has been handed to this department for attention. The letter Is, In part, as follows: "If I purchase grain from local parties and rent space in a local elevator to store the same, does the elevator renting me the storage bin come under the warehouse act? You will under - stand in the proposed contract it. would be provided that my grain would be stored therein, and not removed therefrom only when called for by me and it would be the identical grain as stored, and the same would be insured in my name and retained in the bin, until I fed it or sold it on the market, either to the elevator com - pany or to others. "Also In case I purchased a bin of grain in the elevator and from the elevator company, and retained It under like conditions, is the elevator subject to the warehouse act? "In either case the charge would be for storage by the month, or week, plus a charge - for elevating It for me as I desired it removed from the bin, all under a contract. But I would hold no warehouse receipt which would be negotiable thereon, and the elevator company would simply- be a bailee for hire. "In no event would the elevator company be permitted to dis - pose of my grain and deliver me other, grain in lieu thereof." The statements that "in either case the charge would be for stbr-. age by the month or week", and "the elevator company would simply be a bailee for hire" evidence the contract as one of storage and that the elevator is a public grain warehouse. A bin in an elevator may be rented from its" owner and may be used by the tenant for the storage of his own grain only without bringing such elevator under . the public warehouse law. In such case the con - tract is one of leasing and not of bailment. The element of bailment only exists, under such conditions, during the transfer of the grain to </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION and from the bin but in our view that, although one of the services specified in the Public Grain Warehouse Law, Section 8, Chapter 160, Session Laws of Nebraska, 1931, page 426, (1931 Supl. to Comp. Stat, for 1929, Sec. 88-219 et seq.) does not make the elevator a public ware - house. As a matter of caution it is suggested that the renting of the bin be evidenced by a written lease so that there may be no mistake as to the relation between the owner of the grain and the owner of the elevator. We trust that this answers both of the questions submitted by you. The Nebraska State Railway Commission has requested an opinion upon the following: On May 28, 1931, the Commission entered an emergency order fixing certain rates on sand, gravel and crushed stone, making such rates ef - fective on the same day. Supplemental orders were made later but they are not material to the present inquiry. Application was filed December 14, 1931, for an emergency order changing the effective .date of the original order from May 28, 1931, to March 10, 1931. On the same day the Commission entered its order making such change. The question is: Alight the Commission change the effective date of its order from May 28, 1931, to March 10, 1D31, thus giving it a retrospective effect? It is the opinion of this department that the Commission was witl-out power to make such retrospective order, and that the order of De - cember 14, 1931, was without effect. The considerations leading to this conclusion are these: It is a rule in Nebraska that a retroactive effect will not be given to a statute unless it is clear, from the language used that the legislature intended to give it that effect. Macintosh v. Johnson, 51 Nebraska 53; Sharpe v. Grand Lodge, A. O. U. W., 108 Nebraska 193; Adair v. Miller, 109 Nebraska 296; State v. Federated Merchants Mutual Insurance Com - pany, 117 Nebraska 98. The legislature has the right under Section 20 of Article 4 of the Constitution to prescribe the time when an order of the Commission fixing a rate may become effective. The presumption that statutes act prospectively rather than retrospectively undoubtedly attaches to an order of the Commission issued under the authority of the statutes. Rate making is deemed legislative in its nature, and as such necessarily </seg>
            <seg id="p238">TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT acts on future rather than on past transactions. In the absence of anything in the statutes indicating the contrary, it must be held that all orders of the State Railway Commission operate prospectively and not retrospectively. This does not, of course, prevent orders granting repar - ation, which Is quasi-judicial In character. In view of the general principles governing this subject, an exam - ination of the statutory provisions renders It clear that the Commis - sion's orders must act only in the future. Section 75-402 providing for changes of rates after January 1, 1902, is, in part, as follows: "The Railway Commission shall fix as soon as practicable thereafter a schedule and classification of rates and charges, ex - cept joint rates hereinafter provided for, for the transportation of freights, passengers and cars over the various lines of railroad in this state and to that end the commission shall give the railroad company or common carriers to be affected thereby ten days' notice of the time and place when and where the rates will be fixed, and any such railroad company or common carriers shall be entitled to be heard at such time and place to the end that justice may be done; and shall have process to enforce the attendance of wit - nesses to be served as in civil cases. The schedule of rates and charges so fixed and prescribed ' shall go into effect not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days, within the discretion of the commission, after the same have been completed and copies there - of mailed to the railway companies and common carriers affected thereby, and any or all rates therein contained shall be and remain in force and effect from and after time unless modified, annulled or otherwise revised either In whole or In part by the railway com - mission, upon a hearing with respect thereto before the commis - sion, or until such rate or rates are finally adjudged to be un - reasonable and unjust In a court of competent jurisdiction." Section 75-409 relating to joint rates is, in part, as follows: . "The rates fixed by the Commission shall go into effect thirty days after mailing a copy of the schedule of joint rates to the rail - way companies and common carriers affected thereby * * *." Section 75-508 relating to service orders is, in part, as follows: "The order or orders provided for in the two next preceding sections, (75-506, 75-507), shall be in force and effect from and after the date fixed by the commission and shall so remain until an - nulled, modified or revised by the commission, or until finally ad - judged to be unreasonable and unjust In a court of Competent Jurisdiction: • • *." Section 75-602 relating to emergency rates is, in part, as follows: "Nothing in the foregoing section shall be construed to pre - vent the Commission from having the power, when deemed by it necessary, to prevent interstate rate wars and injury to the busi - ness of the citizens of the state, railway companies or common carriers, or in case of any other emergency to be judged by the </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Commission, and it shall be the duty of the Commission, to tem - porarily alter, amend or suspend any existing freight rates, tariffs, schedules, Orders and circulars of any railway company or common carrier, or part thereof, in this state, and to fix freight rates where none exist, which emergency rate. or rates shall apply to any one or more or all railway companies or common carriers In this state, and shall take effect at such time and remain in force such length of time as may be prescribed by the Commission: * * *". It will be noted that the emergency order provided for in the pre - ceding section Is preventive in character. Such an order must, in the nature of things, relate to the future and not to the past. </seg>
