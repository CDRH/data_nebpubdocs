            <seg id="p005">The More Important Poultry Diseases L. VAN ES AND H. M. MARTIN INTRODUCTION I The frequency of live stock diseases is to a large extent &gt;endent upon the density of the animal population. The lltry diseases of Nebraska furnish an excellent illustration this. During the years immediately following the period the pioneers, when farm flocks were yet small and far be - een, the diseases of domestic fowls did not constitute a &gt;blem worthy of great consideration. This has all been inged during the last ten years. Owing to the increased its of food products and improved marketing facilities, the iltry industry has assumed proportions undreamt of a arter of a century ago. Poultry raising gained recognition a valuable part of the business of farming, and farm flocks jatly increased, not only in numbers but also in size. As ; poultry population became more and more dense, disease problems commenced to present themselves at an increasing rate until at the present time they must be reckoned with con - stantly and seriously. Some idea as to the extent of some of our more prevalent poultry diseases may be formed when the laboratory records of the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of the Experiment Station are examined. More than one-third of the laboratory specimens received there for the diagnosis of disease pertain to poultry diseases. Of the specimens exam - ined, the disease fowl cholera was found in 27 per cent of the total and those came from about 40 Nebraska counties. Tuber - culosis, found in 13 per cent of the specimens, came from 36 counties, and 54 counties sent in fowls infested with one or more species of parasites, the invaded birds forming some 15 per cent of the specimens examined. Roup cases came from 21 counties; but as this disease is so well known that most people recognize it without special assistance, the number of cases received at the laboratory cannot be regarded as an index to the prevalence of the disease. Roup is probably com - mon in all the counties. Cases of fowl typhoid came from 11, of fowl pox from 8, of blackhead from 4, of coccidiosis from 4, and of white bacillary diarrhea from 20 counties. The few data submitted indicate that some of the more damaging fowl diseases are quite prevalent in the state, while many others likewise possessed of a considerable power of mischief are sufficiently common to demand attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 6 The certainty that poultry diseases have become a problem of considerable magnitude and the belief that our farmers and poultry raisers would welcome information on the subject were regarded as warrant sufficient for the issuance of this publication. CURE OR PREVENTION Disease problems have to be solved, if such is at all possi - ble, in two ways. These are, cure and prevention. The for - mer pertains to the animals already sick and the latter to the ones capable of becoming so. In poultry diseases the management by curative treatment is particularly inept, because in the hrst place all methods of treatment usually result in failure and in the second place be - cause, even if successful, the cost, as compared with the value of the birds saved, would be entirely too high for practical purposes. Successful treatment of sick animals means indi - vidual care, often several times a day, and this takes time, without mentioning the fact that it may also require a consid - erable degree of skill. In the face of rather poor prospects of results, the treat - ment is commonly too costly because of the time required for each bird, and in all probability there is money to be saved by destroying sick birds rather than by treating them. Mass treatment of a whole flock by adding medicine to the drinking water is no better than good wishes and often far more dan - gerous to the fowls. The poultry disease problem thus is clearly one to be solved by preventive measures, which not only promise the best results, but also are the least expensive. Before discussing the special diseases which affect poultry, a brief review of the principles upon which disease prevention is based may not be amiss. POULTRY HYGIENE The prevention of poultry diseases depends on the follow - ing factors: (1) The selection of sound breeding stock , (2) correct and adequate feeding methods, (3) sanitation, (4) the eradication and control of the transmissible diseases. Breeding stock. — In the foundation and the further propagation of the flock it is quite essential that the breed - ing stock be healthy, vigorous, and robust. Such animals may not be exempt from infection, but a vigorous constitu - tion is a valuable advantage nevertheless. The less vigorous members of the flock should alwavs be the ones culled out </seg>
            <seg id="p007">The More Important Poultry Diseases 7 for table use and they should never be used for breeding. The same principle is applicable to the older birds, and the flock from which birds over two years old are eliminated is always the stronger both from the standpoint of produc - tivity and from that of sanitary fitness. Birds, both male and female, should be carefully selected for the purpose of flock propagation and they should be ma - ture, vigorous, active, and well developed. There should be no defects in body conformation and their health should be in no way impaired. When a new flock is to be started or an old one to be in - creased or improved by new blood, preference should be given to hatching eggs or to very young chicks from other flocks of which the general state of health is well known to the pur - chaser, especially with reference to bacillary white diarrhea, which is transmitted by means of infected eggs. Proper feeding. — Feed for poultry must contain not only a required amount of nutrient substances, but also the ill defined food factors sometimes spoken of as vitamins. This is particularly important in the feeding of brooder chicks and such as are being kept in rather close confinement. There are many indications that a considerable portion of the losses among chicks is to be attributed to a lack of the food factors mentioned, especially those contained in green leaves. As the subject of feeding lies somewhat outside the scope of this pub - lication, the reader is referred to the information contained in Nebraska Extension Circular No- 1401, issued by the De - partment of Poultry Husbandry of this Experiment Station. Sanitation. — Sanitation consists in the establishment and maintenance of surroundings fit and safe for animals to live in. In connection with sanitation the term "surround - ings" must be made to include everything with which an animal comes in contact, so that under this heading con - sideration must be given to feed, water, and air as well as to the housing, yards, and soil. The hygienic aspect of the soil is of particular interest because on it are deposited the body wastes, which may con - tain the bacteria of disease or the eggs of internal parasites. Large numbers of fowls inhabiting small areas of soil may so contaminate the latter that certain diseases become mote or less permanently established. This actually happens on sev - eral farmyards and often renders the eradication of disease extremely difficult. When soil is left unpopulated for a time, it rids itself of the harmful materials mentioned; but when </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 there is a continued concentration of a large number of animals on a comparatively small area of soil, the latter gradu - ally assumes the quality of sewage or body wastes. No species of animal can persist in a more or less intimate contact with its own body wastes without incurring extraordinary hazards of becoming involved in outbreaks of disease. Even in the maintenance and exploitation of the farmyard flock, those facts must be reckoned with. While at the pres - ent time rotation of poultry yards is not as urgently needed in Nebraska as that of hog yards, sooner or later the disease and parasite problem will compel this. Even now a rotation of the yards has its place. The poultry house should communi - cate with two yards properly fenced, one used by the poultry and the other under cultivation. The areas should be large enough and be provided with shade. The poultry should be enclosed there during spring and summer, while during fall and winter they may be given the freedom of the farmstead and in the spring be transferred to the second yard for the following season. Poultry yards, as well as the building sites for poultry houses, should be selected with a view to dryness and shelter. A sandy, gravelly soil is always to be preferred for the pur - pose mentioned, while the topography should be such as to provide a free, natural drainage. Whenever this is not ob - tainable, some artificial means of drainage should be estab - lished. In poultry yards surface water should not be per - mitted to accumulate in low places, wagon ruts, and the like. Open drains likewise are objectionable. The desirable amount of shelter may be obtained from sur - rounding trees or by having houses and yards located on the leeward side of a hill or of some of the larger farm buildings. A southern exposure is usually preferable, and the shelter and shade present should never be such that direct sunlight is excluded altogether. In the construction of poultry houses financial considera - tion will often determine the type of building to be erected, but on the whole the following qualities and types should be aimed at. Floors and foundation should be impervious to moisture and *be vermin and rat proof. Concrete is perhaps the best material for this purpose, altho its heat conducting quality somewhat detracts from its value because this is apt to render the floor a bit cold during winter weather. By placing the concrete on a layer of hollow tile the disadvantage can be con- </seg>
            <seg id="p009">The More Important Poultry Diseases 9 siderably reduced. Dirt floors are always objectionable be - cause they cannot be cleaned or adequately disinfected, while plank floors are sooner or later bound to furnish shelter for rats and other vermin. The walls of the poultry houses should be so constructed as to promote dryness and warmth within and yet in such a manner that such animals as rats, mice, lice, or mites will not readily find lodging places. A wall constructed of studding, sheeted with matched lumber on both sides, each side resting on a layer of tar paper, is probably the most suitable. The space between studdings can then be filled with porous cinders and the latter may be mixed with pieces of glass in order to render the space less suitable as a place of abode for predatory animals. In order to prevent mites and insects from concealing themselves between the seams, it is advisable to paint the joints with a thick coal tar before the boards are nailed on. Whenever the cost of the building is not to be seriously considered, it may be provided with a tight ceiling. This establishes a dead air space below the roof which promotes warmth in winter and coolness in summer. In structures in which low cost is necessary, a loose ceiling covered with straw will give the same results, but the practice does not "promote cleanliness and supplies a good hiding place for vermin and insects. Good lighting is an important sanitary requirement of a poultry house and hence the latter must be adequately pro - vided with windows. An excess of windows must, how - ever, be avoided as this would render the space within too cold in winter. One square foot of window area for every twelve square feet of floor space should be sufficient for Nebraska conditions. While the ventilation requirements of fowls are by no means well known, there is evidence enough available which points toward the wisdom of not neglecting this detail in the construction of poultry houses. In the smaller buildings, door and window ventilation will usually be sufficient and all the more so if instead of the common glass windows the sash is provided with muslin instead of glass. A still better arrange - ment can be secured by constructing frames over which the muslin is stretched and of such dimensions that they can be inserted under the raised windows. In the larger establishments special ventilation provision must be supplied. Ordinarily this consists of special air inlets </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 and outlets. The former are so arranged that a suitable open - ing is made in the outer sheeting of the wall between two stud - dings and close to the foundation plate. A similar opening is made in the inner sheeting, but quite close to the ceiling. The space within thus serves the purpose of an intake flue. In the ventilation of large spaces, direct draft is prevented by pro - viding several such intakes in the place of one large one. The plan by which the air is forced to pass upward between the studdings is likewise designed to do away with direct draft. If the current, however, proves to be too strong for comfort, the disadvantage may be further overcome by placing a horizontal muslin screen immediately below the inner inlet. The outlet flue is usually centrally placed within the space to be ventilated and this should be so planned that the out - going air enters it near the floor. The flue is made to project above the roof so that the outside opening is well exposed to the wind. According to estimates by King, the outlets as well as the intakes should present a cross section area of four square inches for every fowl, or two hundred square inches for every fifty birds. The inlets, however, should be equipped with sliding valves so as to permit regulation of the air volume ad - mitted under varying weather conditions. In order to permit a ready control of external parasites and an efficient disinfection, all interior fixtures should be removable and constructed in such a manner that they can be easily taken apart. The roosts should be placed in the warmest part of the house. The perches should be on the same level, if at all possible, and each fowl should have no less than from six to eight inches of perch room. An ordinary two by four, placed on edge and properly rounded and smoothed, is very suitable as a perch. The latter should never be of such a diameter that the birds are forced to clutch it in order to maintain their position. This disturbs their rest and is not infrequently a cause of defects of the feet. In the management of poultry houses a high degree of cleanliness should be the first care. In the case of the larger flocks a daily cleaning is advisable, but when the flock is small a thoro cleaning once or twice a week will probably be sufficient. In addition to the feed offered to the poultry having the required nutrient value, it must also be fit from a sanitary point of view. Spoiled, musty, or moldy grain as well as </seg>
            <seg id="p011">The More Important Poultry Diseases 11 partly decayed or tainted meat scraps and bone must be avoided. Overfeeding must be guarded against. The feed should be provided in hoppers and not be thrown on the always more or less contaminated ground. Of great sanitary importance is the question of pure drink - ing water. Many poultry diseases are more or less water born because of contamination by the fowls' droppings. All sources of water supply which are open to such contamination should be removed or discarded. Water fountains, placed some distance above the ground and of which the contents can be protected against pollution, are to be preferred to the open water trough or basin. The water must be frequently changed and the containers scalded by means of boiling water. The addition of chemicals and medicines to food and water is always unnecessary and quite often harmful. Special attention must be given to some of the factors which tend to keep the birds free from external parasites. Among tuese the so-called dust wallow is exceedingly useful. Not only does it enable the fowls to shake off at least a part of the parasites, but it also is of assistance in the removal of dead scales, scurf, and loose feathers. It promotes individual cleanliness. The dust of the bath must be very dry, fine, and light. Fine sand to which a certain amount of cheap snuff has been added is most excellent for the purpose. The best place for the dust wallow is in the free, open air, but when weather conditions compel the keeping of the birds indoors a box or screened off portion of the poultry house may answer the purpose. The control of transmissible diseases. — The transmis- sible diseases, also often referred to as infectious or conta - gious diseases, are the ones which are, above all, of economic importance. Those diseases menace entire flocks. The so - called sporadic diseases, which affect or kill a bird now and then, are of no special interest to the average flock owner and their consideration can serve no practical purpose. For this reason, this publication deals only with those diseases which are a menace to the entire flock or a large portion of it. Before we make inquiry into the various diseases which belong to this group, some of the general principles upon which disease prevention rests may be mentioned. In the first place, the poultry owner should always look upon a sick fowl with considerable suspicion. When one or more members of the flock are moping and drooping around, </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 it is always well to consider the presence of specific infection as a possibility. Such sick fowls should be immediately segre - gated from the flock, if not destroyed and burned outright. If birds die in numbers from unknown causes, the carcasses may be sent to the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of this Experiment Station, whenever the nature of the disease cannot be ascertained by the local veterinary prac - titioner or whenever such a person is not available to give prompt advice. Dead birds should never be carelessly disposed of. They should always be burned, and the same measure should be applied to the offal of poultry killed for table use. Newly purchased fowls, as well as those returning from shows and fairs, must always be kept in isolation until obser - vations continued for two or three weeks show them to be disease free. A well organized poultry establishment should always be prepared to move the healthy part of a flock to non-infected premises in the event of disease outbreak. In fact a special space may be reserved for this purpose. When virulent disease breaks out in a flock, the still healthy birds should be removed to such clean ground and there divided into as many small, separate groups as possible. All sick birds should be killed at once, without the spilling of any blood, and their carcasses destroyed by burning. All eating and drinking utensils and the poultry houses are to be disinfected in a most thoro manner. Infected yards and quarters should be left unpopulated by poultry until they have been exposed for at least two or three months to the purifying influences of warm weather. During this period all pools and puddles should be drained and filled in; and if the yards during this time can be plowed up and placed under cultivation, this will yield a material advantage. Before restocking with a full, new flock, a dozen or so of young healthy fowls may be placed on the premises and the restocking postponed until those test birds have remained in good health for the period of one month. In certain outbreaks of very virulent disease or in the case of extremely rapid spread of the same, it becomes sometimes advisable to kill the entire flock in order to save the meat of the fowls still healthy for immediate consumption or by canning it for future use. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">The More Important Poultry Diseases 13 M1CROB1C DISEASES FOWL CHOLERA This disease is no doubt responsible for the greater part of the death losses among mature poultry occurring on Nebraska farms. It is widespread within the State and it is definitely known that during the last five years the disease has occurred in not less than forty of the counties. The disease appears t» be particularly prevalent in those regions where farming is most intensively practiced and where the farm flocks are the largest and their proximity the closest. Cause. — Fowl cholera is caused by a microorganism known as the fowl cholera bacillus. This is quite small, non - motile, ovoid in shape, and with a tendency to become colored, only at the extremities, by the ordinary stains used in the 'aboratory. It can be readily grown on artificial culture media, altho its growth is but rarely very profuse. The organism is more or less widely distributed in nature and forms part of the microorganisms belonging to the so - called hemorrhagic septicemia group. The fowl cholera ba - cillus is, as a rule, extremely virulent to the small laboratory animals, rabbits especially being markedly susceptible. Outside the animal body the bacillus may survive for pe - riods of considerable length. In the droppings they will remain alive and virulent for at least one month, while in soil or de - composing carcasses they have been found to remain alive for three months. Those periods, however, are subject to consid - erable variation on account of such influences as tempera - ture, moisture, and the complex process by which soil and other substances are purified. All species of domestic birds are susceptible to the dis - ease. The common fowl and turkey are common victims, while geese and ducks are subject to extremely disastrous out - breaks of the disease. Many wild birds are liable to the in - fection and it is quite probable that they are factors in carry - ing the infection from place to place. It is commonly accepted that fowl cholera infection enters the body with contaminated food and water. The feeding of the offal of infected fowls killed for the table may likewise be a means of carrying the infection. No doubt the germs may also be introduced into the body thru small abrasions of the skin, while infected dust deposited on the mucous mem - branes of the upper air passages may have a similar result. As soon as the organism has found entrance into the body </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 of the susceptible fowl it is rapidly disseminated thru the body; there it swarms into the blood circulation or may be - come localized in certain tissues. The infection is given off by the diseased birds especially by means of the body wastes. These contaminate the soil as well as the food and water of the poultry yard and constitute perhaps the most important factor in the dissemination of the disease. After the death of the infected birds, their car - casses, thoroly laden with infection, may remain a source of infection for many months, a fact which is made especially potent of danger thru the tendency of healthy birds to eat this type of material. In the case of waterfowl, the contaminated water of the ponds and ditches in which the birds swim is probably the most prolific source of infection. It is not always possible to determine how the disease is introduced into a flock. It commonly follows the introduction of new purchases or the purchase of birds used for the table. All such birds may be of normal appearance and yet be in - fected, as there is evidence which shows that a certain number of fowls of infected flocks while escaping disease or death may become more or less persistent carriers of the infection. Another vehicle of infection may be found in eggs pro - cured from infected flocks. The bacillus of fowl cholera has been repeatedly found in eggs of infected chickens and such must certainly be regarded as potential sources of danger, even if there is little evidence which points in that direction. In fact, the danger from infected eggs is somewhat denied by the fact that fowl cholera is relatively rare in chicks and young poultry. This department has received fowl cholera fowls from many hundreds of outbreaks and yet in no case was the disease found in chicks under two months old. Symptoms. — In the infection of flocks by natural ex - posure, from four to nine days, as a rule, elapse between the introduction of the infected material and the first appearance of symptoms, if symptoms there are at all. The manifestations of the disease present evidence of great virulence and we know of no other disease which in such a short space of time can cause such havoc in a poultry flock. It is especially during the beginning of the outbreak that the infection may be explosively deadly. Birds are seen in appar - ently normal state of health and next are found dead within the space of an hour or two. The indication of trouble in a flock frequently consists in </seg>
            <seg id="p015">The More Important Poultry Diseases 15 the finding of one or several fowls dead on the nests or under the perches. In such outbreaks sick poultry is but rarely seen on account of the overpowering rapidity with which the disease kills. When the outbreaks progress, the virulence may become less marked and sick birds may be found and examined. Then we find the sick fowls to be dull, stupid, with ruffled feathers, and their heads tucked under their wings. There is commonly a high degree of drowsiness, which quite often assumes the character of profound sleep or coma. Affected animals still able to move will frequently show lameness, on account of inflammatory joint lesions, accompanied or not by enlarge - ment of the parts. The wings droop or are carried in an unnatural position, owing to the same cause. The comb and wattles commonly have a dull, purple color, altho this is not by any means a very constant symptom. Nostrils and mouth may be filled with a whitish or pinkish froth. Diarrhea is a frequent symptom, sometimes very con - spicuous and then again altogether absent. In the beginning of outbreaks diarrhea may not be observed because the fowls succumb so rapidly that there is no time for its development. The bowel discharges appear as profuse watery evacua - tions, of a yellowish gray, yellowish, greenish, or pinkish color. The color is never such as to indicate the nature of the disease. The recognition of poultry diseases by the color of the dung is not possible. The bowel discharges soil the feath - ers and not uncommonly the latter are glued together into a fetid mass about the vent. The sick birds not uncommonly show hard, difficult breath - ing, accompanied by a rattling sound, indicating the presence of fluid mucus in the air passages. When the virulence of the outbreak diminishes, the fowls die less suddenly ; they lie around sick for three or four days before dying or become involved in the chronic form of the disease, when they remain in a stupor for several days, with - out eating or drinking. Such cases waste away in flesh, often to a remarkable degree. Recovery from fowl cholera is very rare and it is quite probable that many of the birds which do recover develop into more or less persistent infection carriers. Diagnosis. — It is not always easy to recognize the dis - ease without having recourse to a bacteriologic examination. None of the symptoms presented by sick birds are sufficiently characteristic for a certain recognition of the disease. The </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 sudden onset of the outbreak with its many sudden deaths will, as a rule, be sufficient to direct one's suspicion at least to the disease under consideration. In outbreaks in which this feature is either absent or not conspicuous, a bacteriologic laboratory will have to be appealed to for the diagnosis of the disease. Lesions. — The after death appearances of poultry dead with fowl cholera are neither constant nor characteristic, while in the majority of cases of sudden death they may be altogether in default. A number of the birds which succumb to a one or two days' illness may present, upon examination, certain changes which point toward the existence of the disease. Hemorrhages in lungs and intestines may be observed, while the latter may present an intense red color in certain sections or thruout. Hemorrhagic specks and spots may mark the external sur - faces of the internal organs as well as the membranes which line the body cavities. The latter frequently contain a more or less marked quantity of liquid in which fibrinous flakes are found to be floating. The same type of content may also fill the sac in which the heart is contained. The surface of the heart itself may be covered with small, deeply red blotches, and this phenomenon is most frequently observed in the case of geese which have died of the disease. In a few cases, the lungs show evidence of pneumonia and present a markedly dark red appearance. In the liver we frequently meet with small, white, ill defined areas which give the organ somewhat of a mottled appearance. The spleen is not usually changed, altho occasionally it is enlarged and congested. In the more chronic forms of the disease there may be found in various parts of the body small areas of a cheesy, dry, yellowish gray substance which contains the germs in large numbers. In the same type of cases, swollen joints filled with a similar substance are commonly encountered. Course. — As we meet with fowl cholera in outbreaks, it is common for it to begin with great virulence, suddenly caus - ing many deaths. After a few days the death rate is less marked and the disease may disappear in varying periods, commonly leaving less than half the flock intact. In some cases the disease disappears as suddenly as it came or takes on the form of sporadic cases which occur one by one at sev - eral days' interval. In other instances, again, the disease begins slowly but steadily causes a greater number of deaths </seg>
            <seg id="p017">The More Important Poultry Diseases 17 until the flock is entirely wiped out or nearly so. It is impos - sible to foretell with any degree of certainty what the out - come of a given outbreak will be. The fate of the birds affected can be more easily foretold. They nearly all die and if a sick bird recovers occasionally it commonly remains in a decrepit state or becomes a chronic virus carrier. On that account, sick birds should be elimin - ated from a flock by killing without delay. Treatment. — Treatment of cholera infected fowls is en - tirely useless and there is not the slightest reason to believe that the use of medicines of any kind can either save infected birds or be depended on to influence the course of an outbreak in a flock. The giving of medicines to fowls with a view of curing cholera is about as futile a thing to do as making a child swallow drugs in the hope that they will cure the measles. Prevention. — The only efforts which can be made against fowl cholera with any hope of success are of a pre - ventive nature. In noninfected flocks, poultry yard cleanli - ness is of primary importance as a means which tends to pre - vent outbreaks. Birds should not be confined and fed in soiled yards where it is impossible for them to secure their feed without this being contaminated with the droppings. The use of self-feeders in which feed contamination is impossible is recommended. Likewise the drinking water should be pro - vided in containers so constructed and placed that pollution is rendered impossible. Any other source of drinking water should be closed to the fowls; pools and puddles or filled wagon tracks should be drained or be filled up. In those sections of the State where fowl cholera outbreaks are common, the keeping of pigeons must be regarded as a menace. These birds are very susceptible to the disease, fly far and wide, and are excellent vehicles to carry the disease into previously noninfected yards. The same thing is true of the common sparrow. Of further importance in the protection of healthy flocks is the management of the newly purchased stock or such stock as is being returned from fairs and shows. It is always ad - visable to keep such fowls in quarantine for three or four weeks before admitting them to the general flock. As far as the introduction of cholera into a flock is concerned, perhaps the least possible chance is being taken when the purchase consists of recently hatched chicks. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">Offal of poultry from outside sources killed for the table should never be disposed of in any other way than by burning. I As the fowl cholera germ has been repeatedly found in ?s, prudence dictates not to use hatching eggs originating infected flocks, even if the extent of this source of danger is known at the present time. tin infected flocks our first attention should be given to immediate destruction of the dead fowls. Birds showing lence of sickness should be killed, without spilling any of blood, and all carcasses burned. The healthy fowls of the flock, so far as they can be deter - mined, should be immediately taken away from the yard or premises in which the outbreak is under way and be taken to some place where the infected flock has not been previously. If possible the flock on the new ground should be divided into as many small groups as practicable. The yard in which the disease gained a foothold should be carefully freed from any insanitary features, and a most thoro search must be made for dead or sick birds in out-of-the - way places so that they may not serve as reservoirs for future infection. Poultry houses, eating and drinking utensils, and whatever else may have been in contact with the affected flock should be thoroly disinfected. The yard in which the disease occurred should be left un - populated by poultry stock until at least it has had the benefit of the purifying action of from two to three months of warm weather. When repopulation of the yard is to be undertaken, a small number of trial birds may be turned into it and their fate observed for some time before risking a greater number of poultry. In outbreaks of great virulence the advisability of slaugh - tering for table use or canning the entire flock must be given consideration. This may be the only way of saving anything at all out of the general wreck. Unfortunately, it is not pos - sible to know the proper time when such an extreme measure should be taken. At the present time there is no reason to believe that any good results can be expected from the use of vaccines. Re - search pertaining to this subject, engaged in by this Station, has thus far yielded results which strongly indicate that such vaccination methods as are used in hog cholera, blackleg, and some other diseases, will perhaps never become available for fowl cholera. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">The More Important Poultry Diseases 19 On the other hand, the same experiments permit the hope that by the use of serum it may become possible to stop the progress of the disease, at least for a few days, during which the sanitary measures recommended may be put into execution. To what extent this hope can be brought to a practical realization cannot be stated at this time. FOWL TYPHOID Fowl typhoid is of less common occurrence in Nebraska than the disease described in the preceding chapter. During the period of investigation, about twenty-five outbreaks were met with and those occurred in eleven different counties of the State. Cause. — Fowl typhoid is a specific communicable dis - ease of common fowls caused by the fowl typhoid bacillus (Bacillus gallinarum) . This organism is a member of the colon-typhoid group of bacteria. The infection is taken into the body thru the digestive tract. Once introduced, the ba - cilli enter the blood current, giving the disease the character of a septicemia. As a rule, the bacilli are present in the spleen in large numbers, but are apt to be found in other organs. The intestinal canal of sick birds is constantly infected and the droppings of such animals constitute the usual vehicle by which the disease is disseminated in a flock. While the fowl typhoid bacillus is capable of producing disease and death in most of the animals used in bacteriologic experiments, natural outbreaks are confined to the common fowls only. Symptoms. — Fowl typhoid manifests itself not unlike fowl cholera, with this difference, that the latter disease is more sudden and more rapidly fatal in its assault on a flock. Both diseases have in common those symptoms which are more or less characteristic of all the acute septicemic in - fections. While fowl typhoid must be classed as an acute disease, its progress in an infected chicken is never precipitate. The time elapsing between the introduction of the infection and the first signs of the disease ranges between three days and approxi - mately two weeks. Chickens inoculated artificially commonly die about the sixth day after the infection. In natural outbreaks the affected fowls show dullness and drowsiness. The feathers are ruffled and the wings droop. The latter is evidence of great muscular weakness, which also frequently causes the birds to be unable to stand or to keep their heads in a normal position. Commonly the color of comb </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 20 and wattles becomes pale, but occasionally those structures become purple on account of the backing up of venous blood due to deficiency of the functioning of the heart. Diarrhea is a very common feature of the disease and is often the most conspicuous symptom. The escape of a great amount of fluid from the bowels is responsible for the fact that the affected birds so commonly show great thirst. While food is nearly always refused, the fowls are always willing to drink. The blood is often of a pale color, owing to a manifest re - duction in the red blood cells. In the more advanced cases the blood is decidedly watery. A microscopic examination of the blood shows that in a majority of fowl typhoid cases the white blood corpuscles are markedly increased in number. Diagnosis. — The recognition of the disease by taking an account of symptoms is practically impossible. The diagnosis is commonly only possible by the application of bacteriologic tests. Fowl typhoid can usually be excluded in outbreaks in which all types of poultry are involved. As a rule, the dis - ease is milder than cholera, and the sudden, unexpected deaths seen in the latter are usually not encountered. Lesions. — On the whole the after death appearances of the fowls affected with typhoid are no more characteristic than the symptoms before death. Some changes, however, should be recognized as pointing toward the presence of fowl typhoid. One of these is the watery condition of the blood, already mentioned when the symptoms were described. Another fea - ture commonly observed in fowl typhoid carcasses is the en - largement and dark red color of the spleen. In a large num - ber of the cases examined at this Station the liver also was enlarged and quite often had a dark bronze color. The organ is often quite friable and more or less degenerated. The ap - pearance of most of the important organs is somewhat deter - mined by the duration of the disease In the cases which succumbed quite rapidly, either there are but few changes or they consist of congestion, while in those which lingered there is greater tendency toward degenerations and the resulting lighter tints. In the cases thus, which resisted death unduly long, we find pale, soft kidneys and hearts, while even in the liver the dark bronze may have made way for a very light brown or mottled yellow. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">The More Important Poultry Diseases 21 In the intestinal canal a catarrhal condition prevails, some - times uniformly thruout its entire extent, sometimes confined to certain sections only. Here and there the mucous mem - brane may be congested or even inflamed. Course. — Affected birds rarely recover and there is no method of treatment by which this unfavorable outlook can be improved. No time and money thus should be wasted in try - ing to save the fowls already sick. As the disease appears in a given flock, there is a prospect that it will not progress as rapidly as cholera and that the losses will be less than could be expected in the latter disease. Yet occasional outbreaks have been observed in which the disease slowly but surely exterminated the entire flock. In young chicks the disease may be quite disastrous. Preventive measures are promising, but under our average farmyard conditions they can not always be undertaken in as thoro a manner as the needs of the case require. Control by sanita - tion is, however, the only means of dealing with the problem. Prevention. — The management of outbreaks of fowl typhoid must be conducted entirely along sanitary lines. All visibly affected fowls should be killed at once and this should be done in such a manner that the blood is kept within the carcasses. The latter must be carefully gathered up and de - stroyed by burning. the fowls which are still in a good state of health should be removed to ground which was not contaminated with the droppings of the affected birds. If it is possible to divide the flock there into small groups this can be counted on to increase its safety with reference to the spread of infection. Some pains should be taken to gather up the droppings of the fowls, and this material should also be burned if this is at all possible. If not, they should be deposited on some field not frequented by poultry stock. The yard previously occupied by the infected flock is to be plowed up and should be left unpopulated by fowls for sev - eral months. Poultry houses, eating and drinking utensils, and tools or appliances used in the removal of the infected droppings should be thoroly disinfected. Water should only be supplied in containers so constructed that contamination by intestinal discharge or polluted soil can be excluded as completely as possible. There should be no other means for the birds to obtain water than the ones m.^n- </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 tio^.ed. Thus pools, wagon ruts filled with surface water, open drains, and open vessels should be eliminated from the poultry yards, as they are important factors in the dissemina - tion of the disease. The drinking utensils in use should be scalded with boiling water once a day and fresh water of un - contaminated sources provided at frequent intervals. The same general care should be exercised in the supplying of feed. Feeding from the ground should be avoided. Self - feeders have a definite place in the prevention of this disease. In the selection of the feed it is preferable to reduce the grain ration and to replace it to a considerable extent by sour but - termilk, sour skim milk, or sour milk, all of which should be of unquestioned purity. The feeding utensils used for these types of feed should be cleansed and scalded daily. When the disease pertains to brooder chicks the same gen - eral plan of sanitation should be followed. The healthy chicks should be at once removed to clean brooders and the sickly ones destroyed. All the utensils coming in contact with the affected animals must be most thoroly disinfected. Particular care should be taken in the handling of the droppings because this material constitutes the more active factor in the promo - tion of the disease. No fowls from the infected flocks should be sold except for immediate killing and the same precaution should be taken in regard to eggs. BACILLARY WHITE DIARRHEA This disease is not very prevalent in this State, yet it is observed frequently enough to deserve consideration by our poultry growers and especially so because the outbreaks which have come to the attention of this Station occurred in not less than twenty of the counties. This indicates that while actual outbreaks are not numerous they are well distributed and that, unless adequate precautions are taken, there is danger that this disease may become a serious menace to the industry. In its most conspicuous form bacillary white diarrhea is a disease of young chicks, due to a specific cause. The same cause, however, is also responsible for disease in adult chick - ens, and in these animals it is also responsible for death losses, altho those are not numerous. In chicks, the disease is pri - marily one of the intestinal canal, while in the adult it par - ticularly affects the ovary. From the structures mentioned the causative microbes invade the other organs of the body thru the general blood circulation and this gives rise to an </seg>
            <seg id="p023">The More Important Poultry Diseases 23 intoxication almost constantly fatal in the chicks and occa - sionally so in the mature fowls. Cause. — The microbe responsible for this disease is known as Bacillus pullorum. It can usually be isolated from the chicks dead with the disease, as well as from diseased adult birds. There is a direct connection between the occurrence of the disease in chicks and in mature fowls. There exists a definite cycle of infection by which the latter is kept alive and disseminated. This infection cycle should be thoroly under - stood, because the prevention of the disease would be ex - tremely difficult without this information. When an outbreak of bacillary white diarrhea among chicks is observed it will be noted that a small number of the affected birds manage to survive. An apparent recovery takes place; but instead of such birds completely overcoming the infection, they continue to harbor the latter and remain carriers of the virus during the remainder of their lives. In such cases the infection is usually localized in the ovary. Here it may actually produce disease and destroy the function of the organ. Ordinarily the disease of the ovary is not sufficiently extensive to completely prevent the production of eggs. Some eggs are thus produced by chronically infected birds, and among the eggs so produced many will be found which contain the specific microbe. With that exception the eggs are normal and fully capable of being fertilized. When they are used for hatching purposes, how - ever, the newly formed chicks become invaded by the infec - tion, with the result that they either die in the shell or become sick with bacillary white diarrhea at the time of hatching. In this manner the cycle is completed and the start is made for a new one. Young chicks, however, do not become infected from the infected egg exclusively. The chicks hatched from noninfected eggs are apt to contract the disease from those which were hatched from the infected ones by the eating of foodstuffs soiled by the droppings of the latter. Symptoms. — Bacillary white diarrhea in chicks is, in the greater number of cases, confined to those less than two days old. The symptoms are not always of such a nature that the disease can be readily recognized. Even when present the diarrhea is not a special characteristic of this disease, since causes other than this infection may sometimes be responsible for it. On the other hand, the true white diarrhea infection may be killing the chicks without any abnormal bowel dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 charge having been observed at all. In such cases the infec - tion is so virulent and kills so quickly that a bowel disturbance has no time to develop to a point at which it gives rise to diar - rhea. In most outbreaks, however, the latter is a more or less prominent feature. It is characterized by a whitish, creamy, gluey discharge in which from time to time brownish streaks may be observed. The discharges, as a rule, are not copious. A sticky nature causes them to adhere to the down about the vent, which may thus become effectually closed up. Evacuation of the bowel content is not uncommonly accompanied by pain, expressed by a peculiar cry. Along with those more acute symptoms the chicks are ob - served to be weak and dull. The appetite fails, the wings droop, and the chicks prefer to remain quietly under the hover. The down is usually somewhat staring, the eyes are kept closed, and little or no interest is shown in what is happening in the immediate surroundings. Loss of flesh can frequently be observed and in the cases which persist for a few days the chicks often assume a rather peculiar form. The abdomen becomes enlarged and protrudes behind and this causes the chicks to appear as if their backs were shortened. Most chicks affected die within a few days after being hatched, altho a number may survive for two weeks or more. A small number recover, to become adult virus carriers. In the older chickens the disease cannot be recognized as such during their lives except by serum tests made in a labora - tory. In a number of chickens examined at this Station there was an ill defined unthriftiness or illness which preceded death. It is only by autopsy and serum tests that the disease can be recognized in the adult fowls. Diagnosis. — The occurrence of fatal disease among chicks a few days old manifested by the symptoms mentioned above should always arouse the suspicion of bacillary white diarrhea. The only definite manner of recognizing the infec - tion is by bacteriologic examination of the chicks dead with the disease. In the case of adult fowls the presence of the infection may be ascertained by the agglutination test made with a small quantity of the blood serum obtained from the suspected birds. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">The More Important Poultry Diseases 25 Lesion*. — When chicks dead with bacillary white diar - rhea are examined, the internal organs are commonly found to be quite pale in color and the general loss of flesh is marked. The crop, gizzard, and intestines are empty or partially filled with a sticky, stringy fluid. In the intestines a small amount of grayish material is sometimes present, while in the ceca a more or less firm cheesy substance may be present. The liver is of a pale or dull ochre color and often has its surface marked by reddish streaks or patches. The substance of the organ is soft and friable, and in the more marked cases the gall bladder may be found to be distended. The presence of an unabsorbed yolk within the abdominal cavity is quite constant and many authors who have occupied themselves with a study of the disease regard this feature as being quite characteristic of the disease. The yolks found in the abdominal cavities of diseased chicks range in size from that of a pea to that of a normal egg yolk and vary in color from yellow to a brownish green or almost black. In consist - ency the unabsorbed yolk may be gelatinous, watery, or cheesy. The persistence of the specific microbe of bacillary white diarrhea in adult fowls is not uncommonly denoted by ovarian disease. In such cases the ovary contains both normal and abnormal follicles (the sacklike structures in which the eggs are formed ) , altho the microbe may be present in both. The nor - mal follicles are like those of a healthy bird and as a rule they show considerable variation in size. In the diseased follicles the variations in size are less marked and in a badly infected ovary many are found of the same volume. While the normal follicles are usually globular in shape, the diseased ones have a tendency to become irregular in outline and angular in form. The surface becomes flattened where the abnormal follicles lie in contact with one another. They show a mottled color - ing and the content has lost its transparency. The color is dull and ranges from a light yellow to a dark greenish brown. The content is more or less firm and may be solid thruout or may consist of a cheesy material suspended in a clear yellow - ish fluid. In not a few cases, probably as a result of the rup - ture of a diseased follicle, a general infection of the body cavity may come about and the birds are apt to die of peri - tonitis. Course. — Baciliary white diarrhea in chicks is an ex - tremely fatal disease. The mortality ranges between 40 and </seg>
            <seg id="p026">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 26 90 per cent and there is no reliable evidence that this high death rate can be reduced by any method of medicinal treat - ment. In the adult chicken affected with the disease the death rate is not great and in the case of those birds the prin - cipal damage is caused by the fact that by laying infected eggs they may become instrumental in perpetuating the disease. Prevention. — In dealing with this disease, preventive measures are the only means at the disposal of the poultry grower. Where the natural history of the disease is understood, it is evident that the major factor in its successful prevention consists in the use of noninfected eggs. This is especially the case when the incubator is being used for hatching, because there the eggs of a considerable number of chickens are used and the chances of disease introduction thus are greater than when a fowl hatches her own eggs. It is therefore extremely important that only eggs be se - lected which originated from flocks or poultry yards having a well-known freedom from infection. Eggs from producers who during a past season experienced trouble with bacillary white diarrhea should not be used for hatching. The same rule should be followed in the case of eggs orig - inating from flocks in which from time to time fowls with diseased ovaries are observed. In this connection it is always a good practice to closely examine the ovary of any bird which is killed for table use. When diseased ovaries are found in this manner, it is advisable to go to other sources for hatching eggs. It is further possible to eliminate the infection-carrying chickens by means of blood tests, but it is doubtful if the cost of the method, when it has to be universally applied, would not render it more or less impracticable. In the case of fowls of great breeding value, however, it deserves consid - eration. When an infected flock has no superior value it would be more practicable to kill the birds for immediate table use or canning, and to make a new start with stock hatched from eggs of unquestioned freedom from infection. On farms where the disease has gained a firm foothold, it seems wise to suspend hatching for a time, altho a thoro clean - ing and disinfection may render such a measure unnecessary. The disinfection of incubators and brooders before the beginning of hatching operations is always a very useful measure and should be made a matter of routine practice. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">The More Important Poultry Diseases 27 Scrupulous cleanliness of all utensils used in the handling of chicks must be practiced. Brooders must be cleaned daily and in the face of infection this should be supplemented by thoro disinfection. The floor of the brooder should be sprinkled with a fine sawdust or alfalfa meal in order to facilitate the complete removal of the droppings. In the operation of the incubator it is of further ad - vantage to provide wire trays on baskets which hold from 12 to 15 eggs each. Such trays are to be equipped with a cover and should be of such a size as to fit conveniently into the incubator tray. About the eighteenth day of hatching the eggs should be placed in these trays. After the hatching the chicks should be kept in the trays for 48 hours, after which they can be placed in the common brooder, as by that time the most critical period will have passed as far as infection danger is concerned. If at all possible the eggs from each hen should be placed in the same tray. In case the eggs of a certain fowl should be infected, the diseased chicks will thus be isolated from the beginning and will not be so apt to endanger the remainder of the hatch. This segregation of the chicks in small groups may even be extended to the brooder, where it is further advisable to so guard the food and water supply that contamination by the droppings is rendered impossible. The judicious feeding of sour milk has been shown to exercise a favorable influence upon the mortality rate in this disease altho there is no reason to regard it as a specific remedy. TUBERCULOSIS Like in some other of our farm animals, tuberculosis is altogether too common a disease among our feathered live stock and there are indications that it is increasing. Among the poultry specimens examined for disease at this Station 13 per cent were found to be affected with tuberculosis and the fowls involved were sent in from 36 different Nebraska counties. The disease was only observed in common fowls and in turkeys, the former supplying the bulk of the material. It must not be thought, however, that these are the only birds susceptible to the infection. Tuberculosis has been found in geese, ducks, swans, pigeons, ostriches, pheasants, parrots, and canary birds. Wild birds in captivity rapidly succumb </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 to it but to what extent it may be prevalent among the free wild birds is not known. One of the writers once observed it in the sparrow and was able to prove that those birds could be readily infected with material taken from tuberculous chickens. It is not improbable that sparrows and other flying birds may aid in the distribution of the disease among poultry flocks on the farms. Cause. — The cause of tuberculosis in all animals is the Bacillus tuberculosis. This organism constitutes a specific entity, but it includes certain strains which are more par - ticularly associated with the animal species affected with the disease. The variety of tuberculosis bacillus particularly re - sponsible for the infection in birds is known as the avian strain. It presents certain characteristic features by which it can often be identified. Those features are particularly shown by the manner in which it grows on artificial culture media and by the tendencies to produce disease in some experimental animals and not in others. The avian tuberculosis bacillus is very virulent to most of the birds and especially so to the domesticated species. It is quite resistant to external influences, and an infected poul - try yard may remain so for a long time after it has been vacated by the tuberculous fowls. It is not readily destroyed by the common disinfectants, but is easily killed by heat. Low temperatures do not affect it in the least. Direct sunlight kills the organism quite rapidly but is only active on the surface of the substance in which it may be contained. As in most transmissible diseases, the spread of tuber - culosis takes its start, directly or indirectly, from an animal previously diseased. The Bacillus tuberculosis cannot under natural conditions grow and propagate itself outside of the animal body. Poultry tuberculosis is not an exception to this rule, and when it is met with in a flock its presence is due to an introduction of the infection from without. This intro - duction frequently follows that of newly purchased fowls into a healthy flock. This, however, is not the only means by which a flock may become infected. Trimmings and offal from poultry purchased for table use and carelessly disposed of also constitute a certain means of transmitting poultry tuber - culosis. To what extent wild birds may serve as vehicles in the transmission of the disease is not known at this time, but its possibility cannot be excluded. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">The More Important Poultry Diseases 29 In the transmission of tuberculosis from fowl to fowl in an infected flock, the droppings of the infected birds must be regarded as practically the only means. The bacilli are often contained in this material in prodigious numbers, altho in not a few cases it may be difficult to find the organism in the bowel discharges. In addition to this mode of exit of the infection, the pos - sibility of escape of bacilli from open lesions of joints and bones must be given recognition. With regard to the entrance of the bacilli into healthy fowls, all evidence strongly points to the fact that poultry tuberculosis is usually introduced thru the digestive organs. In the ordinary course of events the droppings of the tuber - culous birds contaminate food and water in which the bacilli are conveyed to the healthy poultry stock. Transmission by means of infected eggs must be given consideration, but it can certainly not be regarded as of com - mon occurrence. The infection picked up in food or water finds its way into the intestines. There the organisms either become local - ized in the intestinal wall or, finding their way into the blood stream, are deposited in the liver or scattered thruout the body. Symptoms. — It is only after the disease has progressed to the more ad - vanced stages that symptoms begin to present themselves which may lead to the suspicion that a bird is affected with t u b e r c u - losis. Before that time either there are no symptoms at all or they are so vague or in - definite that they have no value in the recognition of the disease. During the latter stages, the Fig. 1. — Tuberculosis of chicken liver. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 disease is commonly indicated by a great loss of flesh, accom- Kied by dullness, roughness of the feathers, and a certain ree of pallor of the comb and wattles. When one lifts a bird so affected, its marked lightness is at once noticed. Upon closer examination, especially of the region of the breast, it seems that the flesh has entirely disappeared and the out - line of the breastbone can be distinctly felt or seen under the skin. In a few cases it is possible to feel the tuberculous masses of the internal organs thru the thin abdominal walls. As a rule, such animals die in an extremely emaciated condition, altho occasionally a bird is observed in a fair state of health or body in spite of extensive tuberculous disease. In a few cases, more external parts are affected, and then such structures as bones, joints, or skin show features char - acteristic of the disease. When the bones and joints are involved in the disease, the affected bird is lame or drags one or both wings, while the diseased parts show distinct enlarge - ments, accompanied by ulceration or not. Diagnosis. — If for the recognition of the disease one had to depend on the symptoms presented by the the living fowls. the majority of the cases would not be diag - nosed until the very last stages were reached. And even then it would be diffi - cult to conclude with any degree of accuracy whether the symptoms pres - ent were those of tuberculosis Fig. 2. — Tuberculosis of chicken liver. or not. Wasting disease may be caused by factors other than tuberculosis, and the swellings of the joints and bones may also be due to a variety of causes. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">The More Important Poultry Diseases 31 When lesions are near the body surface, they may be sub - jected to a bacteriologic examination, and the same may be done with the droppings; but on the whole such methods are rather unsatisfactory. As a rule the question of diagnosis pertains more par - ticularly to the flock as a whole, and hence the most practical method of gaining knowledge about the absence or presence of tuberculosis is to kill one or more suspected birds for the purpose of post-mortem examination. Circumstances, however, often arise which ren - der it desirable to recognize the infection in the living animals. When such is the case, the tuber - culin test, which became available about ten years ago, may render valuable assistance. Tuberculin test.— For the purpose of testing chickens for tuberculosis a tuberculin prepared from the avian tuberculosis bacillus is used and the method employed consists of the injection of a small droplet of this substance into and not under the skin of one of the wattles. This is done by means of a small syringe carry - ing a No. 26 or No. 27 gauge needle. It is very essential that the injections be made in a correct manner, and, while this is not particularly difficult, a certain degree of skill must be acquired before reliable results can be expected. While the wattle of the fowl to be tested is held between the thumb and index finger of the operator, the needle is carefully inserted into the skin in a slanting direction. Care must be taken not to push the needle thru the skin, because tuberculin injected under the skin will not produce a reaction. Neither must the needle be inserted too superficially, as in such a case the injected tuberculin will break thru and escape on the surface. With the needle placed correctly within the sub - stance of the skin, the plunger of the syringe is slowly pushed in, causing a small quantity of the tuberculin to diffuse around the needle point. The most successful injections are those which require a considerable degree of pressure upon the Fig. 3.— plunger and during which the tuberculin diffuses iherculi syringe. but slowly into the skin tissues. In such injections </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 an increasing white or yellowish area gradually replaces the normal red color of the wattle. No attempt need be made to regulate the amount of tuber - culin to be used for each injection. When the injection is made correctly, this amount regulates itself by the degree of resistance offered by the tissues. About so much can be injected and no more, while the amount used has but little influence on the degree of the reaction if any is to follow. The smallest dose of the tuberculin correctly placed is amply suf - ficient for the object aimed at. One cubic centimeter of avian tuberculin should be amply sufficient for the testing of twenty fowls. When a reaction takes place, it consists of a more or less distinct swelling of the injected wattle. Such swelling may show a con - siderable variation in size in the birds which react to the test. In some it is scarcely perceptible, while in others the wattle may be more than double the size of its uninjected mate. The swellings are not inflam - matory and the red color of the normal wattle is com - monly changed to a lighter hue. Tn the central portion of the enlargement, the parts are usually of a pale, yellowish color, while im - mediately around this area a dirty, red tint, occasion - ally with a greenish cast, may be observed. As a rule the reaction can be observed 24 hours after the injection, but in the majority of cases it does not attain its maxi- Fig. 4. — Tuberculin reaction in left wattle. mum until about 48 hours after the injection. From then on the swelling gradually disappears and on the fifth day after the injection it has usually completely disappeared. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">The More Important Poultry Diseases 33 The test is not an absolute one, largely because of the fact that some birds, when they are very extensively diseased, will have lost their capacity for reaction. Such birds, however, can nearly always be recognized by their emaciation and such other symptoms as accompany the disease. In the interpretation of the results, all manifest swellings after injection must be regarded as evidence of infection; and when we also place in the diseased groups all the fowls showing what may be called a doubtful reaction, the danger of missing many cases of tuberculosis can be reduced to a minimum. Lesions. — As the name tuberculosis indicates, the chief characteristic of the disease is the formation of small nodules or tubercles. This is seen in all the typical forms of the disease in all animals, and that in birds offers no exception to this rule. The nodules mentioned occur as whitish, grayish, or pearly spherical bodies either imbedded in the tissues of the organs affected or protruding from their free surfaces. Commonly of millet seed size, they always have a tendency to form conglomerations, which may grow to be of consider - able size. When the tubercles are found in the skin or mucous membranes, they show a tendency to break down and to form ulcers. The older tubercles are composed of a cheesy substance and in this material the bacillus can be frequently found. The distribution of the lesions of avian tuberculosis is quite characteristic of the disease. In fowls the liver is the organ most commonly affected, closely followed by the spleen. The intestines are commonly involved in the disease, while bones and joints are also favorite seats of the infection. Lesions are further observed in the ovary, testicles, lungs, and kidneys and more rarely in almost anyjother part of the body. The appearance of the liver lesions is determined to a large extent by the duration of the disease. In the more recent cases the nodules are small and when only a moderate number of bacilli have invaded the organ their appearance may not be very conspicuous. In the case of an overpower - ing invasion the number of tubercles may be enormous. In the older lesions the tubercles are larger, frequently en - capsulated, and quite sharply differentiated from the sur - rounding liver tissue. In the more advanced cases the liver may be greatly enlarged, either in its entirety or in only one of the lobes. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 Under the influence of degenerative changes the organ as - sumes a lighter color and its tissues become quite friable, so that fatal hemorrhages may take place. The spleen, under the influence of tuberculous disease, often becomes greatly enlarged and distorted. The nodules found in the spleen are similar to those in the liver, altho quite commonly somewhat smaller. In very old cases this organ may be transformed into a cheesy mass in which in - dividual tubercles can no longer be distinguished. In the intestine the lesions vary somewhat according to their situation. They may consist of very small nodules in the mucous -membrane or of small ulcers with slightly raised edges. More commonly the nodules are prominent on the outer surface of the intestine. In such cases the lesions give rise to scars in the wall of the tube and contain a tine, gritty substance. Such nodules, either single or combined in masses, range in size from that of a pinhead to that of a pigeon egg. They are either imbedded in the substance of the intestinal wall or attached to the outer surface by means of a slender stem or neck. The smaller nodules often present a pearly appearance, while the larger ones are more opaque, white or yellowish in color, and of a more solid consistency. The lesions in the other organs mentioned, on the whole, conform to those seen in the liver, spleen, and intestines. Course. — As is commonly the case in tuberculosis in other animals, the disease in birds also is chronically pro - gressive. It slowly and surely leads to emaciation and death. This chronic nature of the disease is responsible for the fact that commonly the older birds of an infected flock furnish the greater number of the cases. Nothing can be expected from curative treatment. Prevention. — Like in many other transmissible diseases, sanitation is an important factor in the prevention of poultry tuberculosis. Cleanliness of the pens, houses, and eating and drinking appliances as well as sanitary construction of poultry houses is of the utmost importance. Overcrowding should be especially avoided because should an infected fowl be present in the flock its more intimate contact with the healthy members of the flock can only promote a more rapid spread of the disease. The introduction of tuberculous birds from without should be particularly guarded against because such fowls are the common vehicles by which the disease is transported from </seg>
            <seg id="p035">The More Important Poultry Diseases 35 place to place. Either the freedom from disease of the newly acquired birds should be absolutely known or it should be proved by the tuberculin test. Care should further be exercised in the disposal of the offal of poultry purchased for the table. This is perhaps not a common means of disease introduction into farm flocks, but in cities and villages the small back yard flock frequently becomes infected from such a source. Hence all offal should be burned instead of being thrown out or disposed of as garbage. The transmission of tuberculosis thru wild birds or by means of infected eggs is somewhat problematic, yet this should not be left without consideration. The prevalence of tuberculosis among cattle and swine may not be a great source of danger to poultry and may not be an important factor in the spread of the disease. Prudence, however, requires that no chances be taken with food products originating from the animals mentioned- The boiling of meat scraps and the like, used as poultry feed, will thus be desirable in order to eliminate all infection danger associated with such material. By the practice of a certain degree of vigilance it will not be difficult to protect a healthy flock against tuber - culosis. Much more difficult is the task of coping with the disease, once it is present in the flock. The management of such a flock may be undertaken along three distinct lines. The problem may be solved in a radical manner by the killing of the entire flock, followed by a thoro cleaning and disinfection of yards, houses, and the eating and drinking utensils. After keeping the premises unoccupied by poultry for a considerable period, restocking can be undertaken, selecting for this purpose recently hatched chicks as they are most apt to be free from tuberculous in - fection. In the case of small flocks and of those where no great breeding value is to be considered, this radical procedure is often the best one to follow as a matter of economy. The fowls so sacrificed are not a total loss, because the ones which upon dressing are shown to be sound or only slightly diseased can be used for food. In summer the carcasses can be pre - served by canning, while in winter it is often possible to keep them in a frozen condition until needed for the table When it is preferable to deal with an outbreak of poultry tuberculosis in a more conservative manner, the diseased and healthy fowls may be separated by means of the tuber- </seg>
            <seg id="p036">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 36 culin test. All birds showing either a positive or a doubtful reaction should be destroyed, the healthy birds taken to non - contaminated quarters, and the infected premises subjected to a thoro cleaning and disinfection. If the older birds be likewise eliminated, the prospect of good results will be in - creased. In the hands of persons skilled in applying the tuberculin test, the method mentioned can be made a very useful factor in the eradication of the disease. The third plan is perhaps somewhat of the nature of a makeshift, as under its operation it is only possible to keep the number of tuberculous fowls down to a certain minimum. The plan consists of the systematic elimination of the older birds. With the removal of all fowls of the age of two years or more, the greater number of diseased birds will be gotten rid of. While this method cannot be recommended, its appli - cation will certainly retard the spread of the disease, while in addition it is a sound policy from a poultry husbandry point of view. ROUP While the diseases thus far described are more thoroly known so far as their causes are concerned, our knowledge regarding the ones included in the term roup is quite in - complete and hence the attempt to define roup can be regarded as only more or less tentative. Commonly there is included under the name roup, condi - tions to which many authors now apply the name canker. We are certain that a clean-cut distinction cannot always be made; but inasmuch as the name "canker" or "diphtheritic roup" is frequently applied to disease manifestations due to the same cause as fowl pox, the name "roup" in this discussion is reserved for a catarrhal condition of the mucous mem - branes of the nasal passages and the cavities connected with them. In a number of cases, even the deeper air passages may be involved. On the whole the disease to which we thus give the name "roup" is of a more benign character than the other ones referred to and quite often presents the character of a common cold. It must be understood that in the light of our present knowledge it is not possible to classify the diseases of the upper air passages of fowls in a definite manner. Cause. — The causative factor of this more benign dis - ease which we tentatively call "roup" is not known. It is quite possible that under certain conditions to which the fowls </seg>
            <seg id="p037">The More Important Poultry Diseases 37 are exposed a number of bacteria normally present on the mucous membranes are induced to assume disease producing functions in the same manner that the common colds of folks come about. It is further possible that the preponderance of a certain bacterial species may cause the disease to present itself with special features. There is sufficient evidence that whatever the cause or causes of roup may be, their action is stimulated or made possible by such insanitary conditions as overcrowding and poor ventilation, while exposure to cold draughts, low temper - atures, and damp weather is correctly regarded as promoting the occurrence of the disease. Under the conditions mentioned, several cases of roup may occur in a flock at a given time; but, on the whole, regular outbreaks such as are seen in canker are not common. Symptoms. — The most conspicuous sign of the disease is the appearance of a sticky, tough discharge from one or both nostrils. This discharge has a tendency to dry around the nostrils as a yellow incrustation. It arises from a super - ficially inflamed mucous membrane ; and as this inflammatory reaction extends into the adjacent sinuses from which the mucus cannot readily drain away, there accumulates in those cavities a rather dry, cheesy mass which causes marble-sized enlargements to protrude below the eyes. The deeper air passages may become involved in this catarrhal condition and as a result a rattling sound produced by the air moving within will be observed. The disease causes discomfort to the birds, which show this by being less active, by having their feathers ruffled, by loss of appetite, and by a more or less complete suspension of egg production. In a not inconsiderable number the eyes may become involved, while birds affected with roup are more or less prone to complicating diseases, among which pneumonia is the most fatal one. Diagnosis. — While the symptoms already described are usually attributed to roup, it is commonly very difficult to rule out the existence of the more damaging and malignant canker. No hard and fast rules can be as yet established which would enable one to differentiate correctly between the two diseases. It is characteristic of roup to be confined to the nose and eyes, while commonly there is no evidence of such destructive changes in the affected parts as are marked </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 by the formation of false membranes. The simultaneous presence of pocklike formations on the external skin should be regarded as sufficient to rule out simple roup. Lesions. — The fundamental result of whatever infection produces roup is a reddened and injected mucous membrane of the section of the respiratory tract involved. When there is free drainage, as a rule nothing more is noted than an increase in the amount of mucus secreted. In those parts where the drainage is defective, like in the sinuses under the eyes, accumulations of a cheesy material may be found. This material is probably nothing else than pus, which in birds often assumes this form. Course. — Roup has a tendency to persist in the affected birds for some time. When it remains confined to the nasal mucous membrane, the mortality among the more vigorous members of the flock is not a great one, but when it occurs in younger birds, during periods of cold, damp weather especially, the losses occasioned by the disease may be quite heavy. It is questionable whether losses can be materially reduced by any form of treatment, altho there is no doubt that adequate treatment may save an occasional fowl. Treatment. — If treatment is at all undertaken it should consist in a cleansing of the nostrils and the application of a mild antiseptic to the mucous membrane of the nose. A warm solution composed of one part of creolin and two hun - dred parts of water may be injected into the nostrils, while the mouth is being kept open to permit the escape of the fluid. This may be alternated by instilling into the nasal passages by means of an eye dropper a mixture composed of 5 grains of carbolic acid, 10 grains of menthol, and one ounce of liquid petrolatum. Treatment must be repeated two or three times a day and must be continued as long as nasal discharge is conspicuous. Accumulations of cheesy matter in the sinuses under the eye are best removed by incisions thru the overlying skin followed by pressing the mass thru the wound made. After this the cavity can be washed out with the creolin solution mentioned above. Prevention. — General sanitary conditions in the poultry house and protection of the birds against the inclemencies of the weather are important factors. As a roup case occurs in the flock, the affected bird should at once be removed, either </seg>
            <seg id="p039">The More Important Poultry Diseases 39 to be kept in complete segregation, or to be used for the table, or to be destroyed or burned, as the judgment of the owner may dictate. Against this disease no vaccines or sera have as yet been prepared which could gain the endorsement of disinter - ested and competent judges. FOWL POX AND CANKER There are reasons to believe that fowl pox and canker are more common in Nebraska than the records of this Station indicate. Both forms of disease are fairly well known to poultry growers, while canker is frequently looked upon as roup, another disease about which the Station is not com - monly consulted. There have occurred in the State a number of outbreaks which resulted in considerable damage, and in some communities the disease is, no doubt, a more or less serious problem. In the discussion of roup it has already been emphasized that it is not always possible to draw a distinct line of demarcation between certain cases of that disease and others of canker. As there now is a certain degree of agreement among investigators regarding the cause of fowl pox and canker, it has become possible to remove those diseases from the category of poultry diseases about which we are still in the dark. In Nebraska the writers have had opportunity to observe this infection only in fowls and turkeys, altho it is well known that pigeons, parrots, guinea fowls, pea fowls, pheasants, and even waterfowls must be looked upon as susceptible. In many instances has the disease proved to be a source of con - siderable losses. Fowl pox and canker have been proved to be the result of one and the same infection. Both forms are due to the same cause, altho in some outbreaks this cause produces only the pox phenomena, in others only canker, while in not an in - considerable group pox and canker are present in the same outbreak and commonly in the same bird. Cause. — Both forms of the disease result from infection by a virus called filterable or ultramicroscopic. Those names indicate that the germs are so small that they will pass thru niters so dense that they will hold back all other bacteria and that even with the aid of the most powerful microscope they remain invisible. The virus can only be demonstrated to be present by in- </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 oculation experiments in susceptible birds. In the diseased fowls the virus is present in the lesions peculiar to the disease, in the blood, and in many of the internal organs. Healthy fowls usually contract the disease by contact with infected ones. Contaminated water and feed no doubt play a part in the transmission. The virus gains entrance thru abrasions of the skin and mucous membranes, while the latter can also in an uninjured state admit the infection. Biting flies and other insects have been ac - cused of transmitting the disease. Animals which recover from the disease usually acquire a certain degree of im - munity for a varying length of time. Symptom*. — W hen the infection manifests itself on the skin the name fowl pox is ap - plied to it. The regions involved in particular are the skin of the head, the comb, and the wattles. In the more severe forms of the dis - ease the skin covering other parts of the body may likewise show the characteristic lesions. Usually from six to fourteen days after the introduction of the virus, there appear, on the surfaces affected, small blisterlike eleva - tions, smooth, and of a white or light gray color. These small areas Fig. 5. — A light case of fowl pox. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">The More Important Poultry Diseases 41 gradually become transformed into wartlike structures with a dry and wrinkled surface and ranging in color from a yellow to a dark brown or even black. Individual warts may grow to be of a pea size but it is not uncommon that several of them become confluent and thus give rise to tumor masses of con - siderable volume. The warty tumors can be readily removed, presenting a raw, roughened, moist surface underneath. In some cases, only a few of such pocks appear, while in others they are so numerous as to bring about a considerable malformation of the parts involved. This pox formation may be extended to the eyelids, the eyes, the corners of the mouth, and even to the adjacent mucous membranes. As long as the lesions of moderate degree remain confined to the external skin, the affected birds show little or no illness; but with the extension of the disease and the involve - ment of the various mucous membranes, the infected animals become dull, inactive, and show a tendency to severe loss of flesh. The name canker is principally applied to that form of the disease in which the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, eyes, or throat participate. In the beginning of the disease the affected mucous membranes show light-colored specks and patches, irregular in form and slightly raised above the surface. Those patches grow and become con - fluent. The superficial layers of the membrane die and the surface is covered with a false membrane composed of an adherent, yellow, cheesy mass, a condition which has given the disease also the name of fowl diphtheria. A similar process may involve the eyes, the nose, and the nasal sinuses as well as the deeper air passages, and then it may be difficult to distinguish it from roup, especially during the earlier stages of the disease. Affected birds may not show constitutional symptoms in the milder forms of canker infection; but when the lesions interfere with breathing and feeding, the general health of the affected animal begins to decline. Diagnosis. — The pock formation of comb and wattles and the occurrence of the adherent, white, cheesy deposits and false membranes in the mouth, eyes, nose, and throat are ordinarily sufficient to establish the identity of the diseases. Lesions. — In fowls dead with the disease there may be found, aside from the lesions visible during life, similar changes in the nasal cavities, the larynx, the windpipe, and the bronchial tubes. Even the intestinal mucous membrane </seg>
            <seg id="p042">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 42 may be found to be in - volved in inflammatory :hanges, with erosions af the surface. The spleen is sometimes en - larged, and the liver may show localized areas of degeneration marked as small, yellow specks on the cut sur - face. The lungs may present a dropsical con - dition, while inflamma - tory changes are often encountered in the body cavity and in some of the joints. It is, how - ever, quite probable that not all those changes can be attrib - uted to the ultramicro - scopic virus and that many of them are due to the secondary infec - tions common in ani- Fie. 6. — Fowl pox and canker. mals in which the power of resistance has been reduced by some primary disease factor. Course. — Both forms of the disease have a tendency to run a chronic course, and the longer the disease persists the less are the chances of ultimate recovery. Taken on the whole the prospects for recovery are not good, the mortality rate fluctuating between 40 per cent and 80 per cent of the fowls affected. The death rate of the canker form of the disease is par - ticularly high, while in the case of pox confined only to the skin the disease has a more benign character. It is ques - tionable whether treatment has much of an influence on the death rate, but no doubt in some few cases it may be helpful in saving at least some of the birds. There is nothing that can be done to destroy the virus in the animal's blood or tissues, and all that can be done is to deal with the more local damages. This is the principal reason why treatment is, as a rule, not very successful. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">The More Important Poultry Diseases 43 Treatment. — In the case of fowl pox in which treat - ment appears to be desirable, the wartlike formations and pocks can be softened by means of some glycerin or vaselin and after this be removed. The eroded surfaces exposed by this procedure may now be gently cauterized by means of a small stick of nitrate of silver. After this the daily applica - tion of some mild antiseptic solution will probably be all that is required. The canker cases do not readily respond to treat - ment. When this is under - taken, nevertheless, the affected parts should be carefully cleaned by means of a one-half per cent solu - tion of the liquor cresolis compound in warm water. The deposits formed on the mucous membranes may be carefully removed by means of the loop end of a hairpin, but this should be done quite gently and without injury to the tis - sues underneath. The ex - posed, raw surfaces or the areas from which the false membranes could not be readilv removed can then i ca 1 1 1 iv 1 rmw \ cu van biicii _ _ - - - . . . be gently swabbed over FlG - '— A bad ca8e of fowl pox ' with a five per cent solution of nitrate of silver applied by means of a bit of absorbent cotton twisted on a small stick. This pertains especially to the mucous membrane of the mouth and throat. When applications have to be made to the eye or the nose, it will be better to use a five per cent solution of argyrol in water, as this is less irritating than the silver solution. Antiseptic washes and the argyrol treatment of the parts should be repeated daily and the nitrate of silver applications only when a new accumulation of cheesy material renders interference advisable. Affected poultry which is to be treated should be kept isolated from the flock. The results of treatment are usually not very good and in most cases of canker at least there is </seg>
            <seg id="p044">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 44 feey to be saved by destroying the birds as soon as they me manifestly diseased. t Prevention. — More dependence can be placed on pre - tive measures than on treatment. These are practically same as those recommended in outbreaks of the other ismissible diseases discussed in this publication. Care in ing new stock and the quarantining of the same for a weeks after arrival and the segregation or even immedi - destruction of affected fowls are measures which tend to vent further spread of the disease. These measures must be supplemented by the maintenance of sanitary surroundings, including cleanliness, food and water of unquestioned purity, disinfection, etc. During the last fifteen years attempts have been made t artificially render fowls immune to the infection, and a mber of reports indicate that at least in some of the out - breaks these efforts have resulted in checking further spread of the disease. The writers are, however, not prepared to say that favorable results are a constant feature after vaccina - tion. The vaccine used for this purpose is prepared from the pocks and wartlike structures which can be removed from the combs and wattles of infected birds. These are removed by scraping the affected parts with a dull knife blade. Care must be taken that the scraping be done so superficially that no blood be drawn. The scraped off material is permitted to become quite dry by exposure to the air and without the use of heat. It can then be placed in a clean box, tightly closed, and forwarded to a laboratory for the preparation of the vaccine. Nebraska poultry raisers who wish to experiment with the method may send such material to the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of this Experiment Station, which will then undertake to prepare the vaccine. This vaccine is suspended in water, and of this suspension one cubic centimeter is injected under the skin of the breast of the animal to be treated. Such a vaccine must be used immediately, as its keeping qualities are not very good, and in addition it is very apt to lose its immunizing qualities while in storage. In badly infected flocks it is well to repeat the injections a week or so after the first one, with a freshly prepared vaccine. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">The More Important Poultry Diseases 45 Vaccination should only be resorted to in infected flocks. In some of the outbreaks for which this Station prepared vaccine, good results were apparently obtained, some ob - servers even going so far as to attribute curative properties to the vaccine. Probably those conclusions were a bit too optimistic and should not be wholly relied on, especially since it was not possible to leave a number of fowls untreated for checking purposes. It seems, however, that the method deserves to be tried out further. COCCIDIOSIS This disease was only rarely encountered in the material coming to this Station for the purpose of examination. It Is not impossible that in the beginning of our investigations some cases may have escaped observation. The disease is perhaps not common enough in Nebraska to deserve a great deal of attention at this time, but with the rapidly increasing extent of its poultry industry it must not be overlooked as a very potential source of damage. The presence of the disease in the State should be a further incentive to the practice of sanitation in the raising of poultry. While many species of birds are susceptible to the disease, it is especially disastrous to young fowls and brooder chicks, altho animals of all ages are susceptible. Causes. — The disease is caused by a microscopic para - site (Eimeria avium) belonging to the class of protozoa. This parasite primarily inhabits the intestines, passing certain phases of its life history in the cells by which the intestinal tube is lined. It leaves the body of its host with the droppings, by which food, water, and the soil of poultry yards become contaminated. By the ingestion of those substances the healthy birds become infected. For this reason the disease is commonly associated with poultry yards in which a great number of fowls are being kept and in which the range is limited. Symptoms. — The manifestations of the disease are not specially characteristic. In common with other microbic diseases, coccidiosis is shown by depression, ruffled feathers or down, weakness, dullness, disinclination to move, and loss of appetite. In young chicks these symptoms may develop rapidly and soon lead to death. Diarrhea is a common feature, and the soft or semiliquid bowel discharges are often found to be streaked with blood. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 In adult poultry the disease runs a less rapid course. Such animals present signs of ill health of an indefinite nature. The birds are inactive, stupid, lose flesh, and show a pallor of comb and wattles. In some cases there is inability to stand and diarrhea is not uncommonly seen. Diagnosis. — Coccidiosis is easily confused with some of the other poultry diseases in which the bowels are impli - cated. The microscopic examination of the bowel discharges or still better of the contents of the blind intestines is about the only way by which a diagnosis can be established with any degree of accuracy. Lesions. — In the recognition of this disease the after death examination of the affected birds is very valuable. In such animals the disease damage is principally found in the two blind guts or ceca. These sections of the intestinal canal are found to be inflamed and their walls thickened. The in - testine involved appears larger, shows a red color, and its inner lining may be wholly or partially destroyed. It is filled either with a bloody mass, which may be soft or more or less solid, or with a cheesy material streaked with blood. The latter is more common in older fowls. Occasionally the disease involves the liver and even the lungs, in which organ it manifests itself by light colored spots or by the formation of cheesy deposits. Course. — In brooder chicks the disease is rapidly fatal, practically all the birds affected succumbing to the infection. In mature fowls the mortality is not so high and the disease extends over a longer period. As a rule the more narrowly confined the flock the greater the mortality. Many of the older birds apparently recover, but they continue to harbor the parasites and become reservoirs by which the disease can be indefinitely maintained in a poultry yard. Treatment. — Coccidiosis furnishes another instance showing that medicinal treatment of poultry diseases is of little or no value. Certain remedies are nevertheless recom - mended and among these only one requires to be mentioned. It consists of the addition of finely powdered crude catechu to the drinking water. About 20 grains of the drug are added to a gallon of water and this is kept constantly available in yards where the disease is prevalent. It appears that oc - casionally some Epsom salts are to be given after the catechu. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">The More Important Poultry Diseases 47 The salts at the rate of from 15 to 20 grains for each bird are best given mixed in a mash. The treatment is probably of a very doubtful value. Prevention. — Of special value in the prevention of coc - cidiosis in fowls is the avoiding of overcrowding the birds in closely confined yards and the providing of clean food and water in such a way that contamination by the droppings is rendered impossible. All that has been said in connection with the prevention of cholera and typhoid is applicable to that of coccidiosis. The rotation of poultry yards is a further means to prevent this disease from doing damage. In flocks already infected, the healthy birds should be immediately removed to clean ground or safe premises. The diseased birds must be either destroyed or kept in isolation for treatment, if such appears to be worth while. All birds should receive less grain in their ration, and buttermilk or other forms of sour milk should be offered as a substitute. The infected yards should be plowed up and put under cultivation for a season. Brooder houses, poultry houses, and appliances for feed - ing and watering should be cleansed by means of boiling water in which some lye has been dissolved. The use of disinfect - ants is frequently recommended, but it is not known to what extent the parasite of coccidiosis can be destroyed in this manner. Hence preference should be given to hot water and lye as a cleansing agent. As a fourth factor in the prevention of this disease must be mentioned the advisability of keeping young chicks away from yards occupied by the older birds. The chicks should have access to clean premises especially reserved for them in advance. BLACKHEAD The name "blackhead" is applied to a disease of the in - testines and liver which is particularly disastrous to turkeys. The designation is suggested by the fact that the color of the head of the birds affected becomes dark for a short time prior to death. This is, however, not characteristic of this disease and constitutes a phenomenon seen in a considerable assort - ment of disorders. In spite of this the name has been solidly established and will probably be continued. Among the poultry disease specimens examined at this Station, blackhead was not often met with; but this is not </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 Eirising when the scarcity of turkey material is considered, e being no more than one turkey in every hundred speci - s examined. It seems probable that this very disease is the principal factor responsible for this scarcity, as it very effectively places a limit on the turkey industry. There was a time when a flock of turkeys could be seen in almost any farmyard in eastern Nebraska. After a while people complained that they no longer had "luck" raising turkeys and the industry languished to become almost extinct. So far as our information goes, this "bad luck" in raising turkeys is but another name for blackhead. The disease has crowded what turkey industry there is left to the more recently settled and developed portions of the State. It is not impossible that there also it will, in time, become a serious menace. Cause. — Blackhead is caused by a microscopic parasite belonging to the protozoa. Its scientific name is Ameba melea - gridis. The life history of this organism is unknown and this lack of knowledge will probably have to be overcome before material advance can be made toward the prevention of the disease. The parasites, however, are known to be present in the blind intestines and livers of diseased birds and from these are eliminated from their bodies by means of the droppings. There is also good evidence that the parasites maintain themselves for long periods in the soil, from which they are usually taken up by healthy birds. It is not im - possible that certain intestinal worms play some part in the propagation of the blackhead ameba. Turkeys are especially liable to be damaged by the parasites, but the latter are also apt to occur in chickens which in exceptional cases also may succumb to the invasion. It seems to be a well established fact that the poults less than four months old show the greatest susceptibility, and that older birds, actually diseased or not as the case may be, serve as reservoirs from which the younger birds directly or in - directly obtain the infection. At this Station the disease was also encountered in pea fowls. Symptoms. — In the more susceptible younger poults the disease may manifest itself during the first month after hatching. When experimentally produced, blackhead symptoms appear usually within a month after the feeding </seg>
            <seg id="p049">The More Important Poultry Diseases 49 of the material containing the ameba. The disease shows it - self in the younger birds by drowsiness, progressive weak - ness, ruffled feathers, drooping wings, and a more or less constant diarrhea. The dark discoloration of the head, al - ready mentioned, may be observed, but this feature cannot be counted on to be always present or to be unmistakable evi - dence of the disease. In the older turkeys the symptoms are less severe, the course of the disease is slower, and the tendency to severe emaciation more pronounced. Such birds may wholly or partially recover. They remain permanent infection carriers and are subject to relapses even at remote periods. Diagnosis. — While the symptoms described above per - taining to turkeys are always sufficient warrant to suspect blackhead, they cannot be depended upon for a definite diagnosis. This, however, is made possible by examination of the organs after death. The lesions characteristic of the disease are described below. In addition to those, the finding of the parasites by microscopic examination makes an accurate recognition of the disease possible. When blackhead thus is suspected it is advisable to kill one or more affected poults for a post-mortem examination or the birds involved may be sent to a laboratory prepared to make the investigation required. Lesions. — Not in all cases of blackhead can definite lesions be demonstrated. The writers have encountered cases in which lesions were either absent or so slight as to be doubtful. In the great majority of the cases, however, the damage done by the disease results in such a characteristic appearance that but little room for doubt is left. The lesions are practically confined to the blind intestines or ceca. They are apparently the primary seat of the in - fection. Either one or both guts may be involved in the disease. This involvement is of an inflammatory nature, under the effect of which the intestinal wall becomes greatly thickened. This thickening may be confined to certain areas only, or the entire tube may be uniformly affected. Partially by the changes caused by the inflammatory process and par - tially because of secondary influences, the mucous lining of the intestines becomes necrotic. The necrotic mass, together with the food material which happens to be present in the gut, </seg>
            <seg id="p050">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 50 gives rise to a dry, cheesy, friable material which distends the in - testinal tube. Often a cross section of the dis - tended cecum shows a concentric arrangement of the material. In the liver there occur areas of tissue death which give the organ a very character - istic appearance. The necrotic or degenerated areas are well visible on the surface of the organ. They range in size from one-tenth to three - fourths of an inch in di - ameter, are more or less circular in shape, and have a light yellowish color. They do not pro - ject beyond the liver surface, but may extend deeply into the sub - stance of the organ. Fig. 8. — Blackhead of turkey liver. More often they are quite distinct especially in the older birds, they altho occasionally, and may become confluent. In not a few of the older cases peritonitis accompanies the changes mentioned. Course. — In young poults the disease is apt to be rapidly fatal. Some of the birds may survive, but as a rule the death rate is very near the hundred per cent mark. In the more mature birds the mortality is less severe and even if there is serious damage in the ceca and liver the animals may survive in a fair state of health. Such birds, in fact all older birds in an infected flock, remain infection carriers and are a menace to the younger generation of birds coming on later. There are few diseases more difficult to control when once the infection has become established on a farm. Treatment. — Many methods of treatment have been rec - ommended, but the most painful search for evidence of success fails to disclose anything which is in the least encour- </seg>
            <seg id="p051">The More Important Poultry Diseases 51 aging. In fact, the results reported and the consideration of the nature of the disease warrant the conclusion that the course of the disease, once established in a turkey, cannot be changed by any means of treatment now known. Prevention. — Owing to the incompleteness of our knowl - edge regarding the biology and the life history of tHe black - head ameba, it has thus far not been possible to define, with any degree of confidence, preventive measures rationally adapted to the problem. In regions in which the disease had obtained a more or less firm foothold it has commonly re - sulted in the suspension of turkey raising altogether, altho it does not appear that, in dealing with the problem, even our limited knowledge of the disease was put to any practical use. This limited knowledge points to certain factors which may be tentatively given consideration as of hygienic im - portance. From the evidence contained in the literature of the subject it appears that healthy turkeys can be raised, even from infected flocks, by the use of the incubator and brooder, that young poults are extremely susceptible to blackhead, that older turkeys must always be looked upon as infection carriers, and that the common fowl may be a source of blackhead infection and should always be so regarded. Theoretically, thus it should be possible to reduce the blackhead risk to a minimum by (1) the use of carefully cleansed turkey eggs for hatching in the incubator and by keeping the poults for the necessary period in clean brooders; (2) avoiding contact between the poults and older turkeys, common fowls, and any other kind of poultry stock; and (3) keeping the poults in more or less spacious confinement on ground which for a period of not less than one or two years has not been used by poultry and especially not by turkeys and chickens. If such a plan of prevention be followed, it must neces - sarily be supplemented by sanitary practices pertaining to the food and water supply, the drainage of lots, and the disinfection of houses, and by the elimination of flying birds as far as possible. FAVUS This disease has not frequently been brought to the at - tention of the writers; but as no doubt it occurs from time to time in this State, it may be briefly mentioned, even if it appears to be without considerable economic importance. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 52 Favus is a skin disease of common fowls manifested by the formation of white areas on comb and wattles, which occa - sionally are extended to the feathered parts of the body. t Cause. — The disease is due to the presence of a fungus chorion gallium). This parasite is transmitted from fowl fowl by direct or indirect contact. t Symptoms and lesion*. — In the beginning of the disease ill, white, moldy specks appear on the comb and wattles, ch gradually enlarge and become confluent until the structures involved are covered with a white layer. In Krse of time this layer thickens and may finally constitute lick crust. The infection may then extend to the feathered parts of the body, when the skin becomes thickened and becomes covered by scabs. The feathers have a tendency to fall out, and in the case of the smaller ones the shaft is com - monly marked by a moldy, white deposit at a level with the skin. In the more severely affected cases a moldy odor can be recognized about the affected animals. Commonly favus re - mains confined to the comb. Diagnosis. — The moldy deposit scarcely leaves any doubt regarding the nature of the disease, but in cases of doubt a microscopic examination of scrapings made from the areas involved will usually promptly reveal the character of the infection. Course. — As a rule the disease is benign in character and especially so when only comb and wattles are affected. In those cases recovery commonly takes place without at - tempts at treatment. When the skin of the body becomes invaded the prospect of the affected fowls is not so favorable, as it is common for them to become emaciated and to die from extreme exhaustion. Treatment and prevention. — Affected animals should be promptly isolated and be treated by the application of a mixture composed of one part of the tincture of iodine and six parts of glycerin. This mixture should be applied two or three times a week. It will probably not be effective when the feathered skin is involved, and hence it seems advisable to destroy such animals without delay so that they may not serve as infection sources. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">The More Important Poultry Diseases 53 PARASITIC DISEASES AND PARASITES Many different species of parasites of domestic poultry have been described, some of which are commonly found in Nebraska, and it is very probable that there occur in prac - tically every poultry yard in the State one or more of these species. Accurate records as to the number of birds found to be infested with parasites have not been kept at this Sta - tion, but the writers have found parasites or evidence of parasites in the majority of fowls examined. In some in - stances as many as live distinct species of parasites were observed in a single bird. As in the case of other animals, the parasites of poultry may be divided in two general groups: (1) the ectoparasites and (2) the endoparasites. Ectoparasites principally live or subsist on the surface of the body, and the group comprises lice, flies, gnats, mosquitoes, bedbugs, fleas, mites, and ticks. LICE Birds under the usual conditions imposed by domestication are especially prone to lousiness; there are in fact few fowls which are entirely free from lice. The trouble caused by lice largely consists of irritation, due to the moving about and the gnawing habits of the parasites. This irritation causes the bird to become restless, which affects their feeding habits and disturbs the digestive functions, and this in turn leads to weakness and an increased susceptibility to disease. In young birds growth may be retarded, and in the case of extraordinary invasion lousiness may actually cause the ani - mals to succumb. The presence of many lice also reduces the productiveness of adult fowls and may cause a flock of chickens to become unprofitable. More than forty different species of lice have been de - scribed in domestic birds, but of those a comparatively small number have been observed in Nebraska. Some of the lice are restricted to one host while others may live on several host species. Those which commonly infest a single host species may possibly pass to some other host for a short period, but there they will not persist nor propagate themselves. Moreover, certain species attack only restricted areas of the body surface of the host and are rarely found in other positions. Some lice are sluggish, almost sta- ECTOPARASITES </seg>
            <seg id="p054">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 54 tionary and confined to a given area, while others are active and move about over the entire body surface. tin Nebraska there are three species of lice which com - lly infest the domestic fowl. They are, Lipeurus hetero - phus, Menopum biseriatum, and Menopum pallidum. The Menopum biseriatum is the largest of the three species and aside from being found on fowls may be found also on turkeys and pigeons. It is very common in Nebraska. The Menopum pallidum closely resembles the preceding species. It is somewhat smaller and less com - mon on the poultry of the State. The Lipeurus heterographus is commonly found about the head and the barbs of the wings and tail feathers. This species is very com - mon on chickens and in this State has also been observed on ducks. Of the other species of poultry lice which were observed in the State, mention may be made of Lipeurus baculus on pigeons, Goniodes falci - cornis on turkeys and peafowls, Fig. 9. — Large chicke louse. (After Osborne.) Menopum phaesostomum on peafowls, and Ornithobius cygni on swans. All true bird lice have biting mouth parts. They subsist on fragments of feathers, scales of the skin, and other debris. Life history. — In general, lice spend their entire life on one host. The eggs, as they are extruded by the female, are attached to the down feathers by means of a sticky secretion. In this position they are commonly known as "nits." Hatching occurs in from four to ten days. The young, after several moltings, reach the adult stage in from seventeen to twenty days. Control and treatment. — In the control of poultry lice fi dust bath described in another chapter is an important tor, while the most efficient and satisfactory means to rid iris of their lice is the use of sodium fluoride. This drug available in a powdered form and may be purchased at any drug store. It may be applied in three ways: (1) by the pinch method, (2) by dusting, and (3) by dipping. The first method consists in placing on the skin of each </seg>
            <seg id="p055">The More Important Poultry Diseases 55 fowl one pinch of sodium fluoride on the head, one on the neck, two on the back, one under each wing, one on the breast, one below the vent, one on each shank, and one at the base of the tail. The bird, when treated, should be held over a flat pan or newspaper in order to collect and save the excess of the drug which was placed on the bird. The dusting method consists in mixing one part of the powdered drug with four parts of flour, talc, or road dust and applying it by means of a shaker to the bird, ruffling its feathers as the mixture is being applied. This method is not as economical or as efficient as the pinch method, and the excess of the powder in the air may be irritating to both the birds and the operators. Dipping in sodium fluoride solution is probably the most economical and efficient method of the three, as it requires less material and less time while it causes no discomfort to the operators. Furthermore, the lice die very promptly after being touched by the solution. A first requisite is a warm, sunny day, so as to insure a rapid drying of the birds. The solution should be prepared in a wooden con - tainer, and metal vessels should be avoided. It may be mixed in a wooden washtub by adding three-fourths of an ounce of commercial powdered sodium fluoride to each gallon of tepid water. In dipping birds, the wings should be held over the back with the left hand. The birds are then placed feet first in the dip and submerged until only the head remains out of the solution. The feathers are thoroly ruffled with the right hand in order to cause the solution to penetrate to the skin. The head is ducked once or twice during the oper - ation. The birds should be drained for a few seconds before being released. After the fowls have been treated for lice, they should not be permitted to roost or occupy infested quarters before the latter are thoroly deloused. All litter should be dis - posed of by burning or by hauling it to fields to which poultry have no access. After the quarters have been well cleaned they should be sprayed or otherwise treated with kerosene emulsion. This preparation can be cheaply prepared and is one of the most efficient delousers known. It is made by dis - solving about one-quarter pound of common laundry soap in one gallon of soft water (rain water) by boiling. When the soap has all dissolved and while the solution is still hot, two gallons of kerosene are poured into it and the mixture </seg>
            <seg id="p056">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 56 vigorously stirred. Of the resulting creamy emulsion, one part is added to eight or ten parts of warm, soft water and this mixture is then used in a sprayer or applied by means of a brush. The mixture may also be used as a dip for poultry and other animals when lice are to be destroyed. FLIES, GNATS. MOSQUITOES. BEDBUGS. AND FLEAS Flies. — The common house and stable flies are of eco - nomic importance to poultry growers inasmuch as they act as intermediate hosts for certain species of tapeworms which infest the common fowl. It is therefore advisable that precaution be taken in order to prevent the maintenance of breeding places for flies in the vicinity of poultry yards. All stable manure and garbage must be promptly removed, because this type of material is a requirement for the completion of the life cycle of the common house fly. Piles of damp, fermenting weeds or lawn cuttings are very favorable breeding places for the common stable fly and should not be allowed to remain. GNATS. — The Simulium meridionale, or turkey gnat, has been found in Nebraska. This species attacks chickens and turkeys, biting the combs and wattles, and is reported to be a cause of disease. Mosquitoes. — These insects are not of great importance to poultry raisers, as they are only occasionally found to attack poultry. They may become a factor, however, when poultry is being kept on or near swampy land or near stagnant bodies of water, and this is only one more reason why such localities should be avoided. Bedbugs. — Bedbugs occasionally attack fowls at night for the purpose of sucking the blood. The ones occurring in Nebraska are Cimex lectularis, or common bedbug, and Conorhinus sanguisuga, or the cone nosed sucking bug or big bedbug. During the daytime they hide in cracks and sheltered places about the poultry house. These pests may be controlled by following the methods recommended for the eradication of mites. Fleas. — The Pulex gcdlinte, or chicken flea, attacks a large number of species of birds, including fowls and pigeons. They feed on the blood. This flea is abundant in dirty poultry lots and especially in nests and houses in which straw is being used. The adult flea is of a dark color and is as capable of jumping as the ones commonly observed in other animals. Fleas are what are known as obligate occasional parasites, that is, parasites which only </seg>
            <seg id="p057">The More Important Poultry Diseases 57 go to their hosts to feed. They are not generally observed on the birds, because they usually attack them by night. Then, however, they cause a considerable amount of annoy - ance and no doubt some damage by constant irritation and loss of blood. The life history of the chicken flea. — The female flea deposits its eggs among the filth and litter in the nests and in the crevices in walls and floors. After a week or ten days the eggs hatch and small, white larvae make their appearance. The larval stage lasts from ten days to three weeks, depending on the temperature. Then the larvae spin a cocoon, in which they pupate. The pupae develop into adult fleas in from ten to twenty-one days. Occasionally birds are visited by the flea of the cat and the dog. Treatment and control. — Fleas are uncommon under sanitary housing conditions. When they occur the poultry houses should be cleaned and sprayed in the manner recom - mended for mites. The use of excelsior or shavings in the place of straw has been recommended, as fleas do not breed as readily in this type of material. THE MITES (Acarina) In Nebraska there occur at least four species of mites which are known to infest poultry, and it is very probable that other species occur which have not yet been observed. RED MITE The common red mite, or Dermanyasus gaUinae, is the most injurious of the poultry mites. They are present in many poultry houses in which cleanliness is at all neglected. When present in large numbers they are apt to prove to be a serious pest. Individual mites are scarcely visible to the naked eye; but on account of their collecting in masses, they are easily detected, especially when they are gorged with blood, as this gives them a red color. When not filled with blood they have a gray color. These mites visit the fowls only for the purpose of feeding, and spend the rest of their time on or under the roosts, in cracks, and crevices, under the droppings or other filth, and in the nesting material, especially if this consists of dirty straw. At night they make their way to the fowls on the perches, annoying their hosts and filling themselves with blood. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 58 Occasionally hens on the nests will be attacked by these mites during the daytime. After gorg- ing themselves with blood they leave the bird. Mites which fail to fill -. "-, . r j? 4S /y&gt; J' themselves with blood jif - j r luring the night in which I wfP they gain access to the I .. - A . fowl will remain on its . — , '' . \-x^ body during the follow - ing day and may there- fore be found on the I H bird during the daytime. Life history. — The fe- males deposit large num- bers of eggs in their day- time retreats. Under Fig. 10. — Red Mite. (After Hutyra and ordinary conditions they Marek.) hatch in about five days. The larvae do not wait for maturity to attack their hosts, altho they may remain for months without having an opportunity to suck blood. After several fillings with blood and after several molts the parasites reach maturity. The entire life cycle is usually completed in a week. Damage by mites. — Infested fowls not only suffer from the extreme irritation and annoyance of the attack, but in addition are damaged by the extraction of a considerable amount of blood. Prolonged infestation will bring about a progressive emaciation and weakness which may result in death. Young chicks especially may become infested in a fatal manner. Excessive infestation by red mites has been held responsible for the increase in the cost of maintenance and for the decrease in egg production. Irritation caused by the mite may cause setting hens to leave the nests. The mites will also attack other animals, including man, causing severe irritation, but they do not remain on a strange host for any considerable length of time. Fowls should not be permitted to roost in buildings with other animals, as such buildings may become infested with the mites, which may then become a source of annoyance to other live stock. Methods of control. — The first essentials are cleanliness and plenty of sunlight, as both of those factors are especially antagonistic to this parasite. • xk/s </seg>
            <seg id="p059">The More Important Poultry Diseases 59 The first step in eradication and control of this pest is the thoro cleaning of the poultry house. All litter, such as loose boards, boxes, droppings, and nesting material, is to be re - moved and destroyed by burning. If the house is of the older type, such built-in accessories as nests and perches should also be removed and burned. This will reduce to a minimum the number of cracks and hiding places. After all this ma - terial has been removed, the house should be thoroly sprayed with kerosene emulsion and particular care should be taken to get the fluid into the cracks and crevices. Since this treat - ment may not destroy the mite eggs and since perhaps some of the mites may escape contact with the fluid, it is necessary to repeat this treatment in about one week, while occasionally a third application may be required. THE HARVEST MITE OR CHIGGER This small, brick red mite (Trombidium holosericum) is only parasitic in its larval stage. It is scarcely visible to the naked eye and quite abundant in Nebraska. The larvae are hatched upon currant and berry bushes and other vegetation, such as fall weeds, grasses, grain, etc. The chigger attacks a wide variety of hosts, including poultry. " ? * Si^ s^ It even may cause a certain mor- tality among chicks hatched late and which may frequent its breed - ing places. The young larvae attach themselves in groups to the skin covered by the wing and about the breast and neck. They give rise to irritation which some- times results in suppuration. It is said that the irritation occasion- ally leads to symptoms resembling PlG u._ C higger. (After epilepsy, which within a few days Megnin.) may be followed by death. Control and treatment. — In so far as possible, poultry should be kept from ranging in infested areas. Dusting with flowers of sulphur may prove to be useful as a means of keep - ing the mites away, while sulphur ointment, kerosene emul - sion, or a mixture of kerosene and lard (1-10) can be used in *he treatment of the birds already infested. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">60 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 THE MITE CAUSING SCALY LEG This mite (Cnemidocoptes mutans) is microscopic in size and is a very common parasite of fowls. It affects the non - feathered portion of the legs and gives rise to an abnormal condition of the skin which is most commonly known as "scaly leg" or foot mange. Scaly leg is found in the common fowl, guinea fowl, tur - key, and pigeon, and in pheasants, partridges, etc., when they are kept in a semidomesticated manner. The presence of the mites under the horny coverings of the leg brings about a diseased condition, which can be readily recognized by the enlarged roughened appearance of the shanks and feet. The mite lives under the epidermic scales which cover the front surface of the legs and the upper surface of the toes. The presence of the parasites causes an irritation which becomes, in time, responsible for the elevation of the epidermic plates and for the formation of a white powdery material which is kept stuck together by the serum which exudes from the deeper layers of the skin. The rough crusts which generally form have externally a grayish color, while on their inner surface the color is white. They are irregular in shape. The Fig. 12.— Scaly-leg mite. (After Hutyra crus t s are verv adherent and if thev are and Marek.) removed the irritated, bleeding skin is exposed to view. A microscopic examination of the crusts re - veals the presence of the mites. The course of the disease is slow, persisting for months or for even more than a year. In other cases the legs become markedly deformed and are often enlarged to three times their normal size. In the most advanced cases the birds may become lame and joint disease may arise or some of the toes may become gangrenous and drop off. In such cases there is loss of appetite, emaciation, and stupor, which may be fol - lowed by death. Control and treatment. — As the mites snread from bird to bird, it seems advisable that the infested birds be isolated from the common flock and that in cases of extreme infesta - tion the fowls be killed and destroyed by burning. Birds slightly or moderately affected may be treated with a fair </seg>
            <seg id="p061">The More Important Poultry Diseases 61 prospect of eliminating the disease. As the parasites may attach themselves to the roosts and other forms of equipment of the poultry house, it is obvious that the latter should be treated in the same manner as recommended against the red Fig. 13. — Scaly leg. mites. After the house has been thoroly cleaned it should be sprayed with kerosene emulsion, which for this purpose should be diluted with five parts of water instead of with eight or ten parts as recommended for application to the skin. In the treatment of the affected fowls the scales and crusts of the legs must be removed as far as this is possible. This should be done without causing irritation or bleeding, and hence it is advisable to soften the parts for a day or two </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 before attempting the removal of the crusts. This may be accomplished by covering the affected parts with com - mon soft or green soap. After this has been left on for the required length of time, the scabs may be removed by washing the legs with warm water and by the use of the fingers or a brush. In all manipulations the underlying skin must be gently dealt with. After the scabs are removed, the parts can be washed with a weak solution of any antiseptic and be permitted to dry thoroly. The next step in the treatment is designed to destroy such mites as were not removed with the scabs and crusts. For this purpose many agents can be used, but perhaps the cheap - est and yet the most efficient among them is kerosene. This may be mixed with lard in the proportion of one part of kero - sene to five parts of lard and can be applied to the legs and feet every other day until all evidence of the disease has disappeared. THE I.KI'l.miNG MITE The depluming mite {Cnemidocoptes gallinae) is an ex - ternal parasite which produces a condition known as "body mange" or "depluming mange." This disease usually appears during spring and summer and is characterized by the dropping off of patches of feathers from different parts of the body. This commonly begins on the rump near the insertion of the tail feathers and from these it spreads to the back, neck, head, thighs, and breast. The large wing and tail feathers are not usually lost. The disease is accompanied by the production of an abundance of epidermal scales, irritation, and itching, which may cause the affected fowl to pluck its feathers. A certain proportion of the cases of so-called feather pulling may be attributed to this source, altho other causes may likewise become responsible for the habit mentioned. The skin, denuded of feathers, is but little thickened and remains normally smooth and elastic. Infestation with this mite may check the egg laying function and the affected birds may in time become emaciated and die as a result. Control and treatment. — The introduction of this para - site into a flock can be prevented by taking care not to intro - duce infested birds. The cleaning and antiparasitic treat - ment of the poultry house should be resorted to whenever the disease makes its appearance in the flock, using the same methods as were recommended for the control of the red mites. </seg>
            <seg id="p063">The More Important Poultry Diseases 63 The feet of cockerels should be repeatedly treated because the mites may be transmitter! during treading. The infested birds may be treated either by the use of kerosene ointment (1-10) or by that of kerosene emulsion. THE AIR-SAC MITE This mite (Cytodites nudus) was not encountered in poul - try material received at this Station, but with the large poultry population of the State it is very apt to occur in some localities. As the name of the parasite indicates, it is an inhabitant of the air sacs of the domestic birds, especially the common fowl, the pigeons, and the pheasants. The mite probably en - ters the air sacs by passing into the nostrils and from there in thru the respiratory passages. They have been observed in all the structures mentioned as well as in the hollow of the bones, which in birds communicate with the respiratory tract. Aberrant mites have been also encountered in the internal organs. This parasite is capable of living for only a short time outside the body of its host. When the mites are present in small numbers only, they do not cause any serious inconven - ience to the affected fowl, and even birds in apparently perfect health have been found to be heavily infested. It is probable that the parasite is not of great economic importance. Yet when the infestation is heavy, the large number of the para - sites is apt to give rise to inflammatory conditions of the air passages and to mechanical obstruction of the same. Treatment and control. — No adequate treatment of the affected birds has as yet been found, and all that can be de - vised in regard to prevention consists in the practice of clean - liness and the maintenance of sanitary surroundings. THE FI.E8H MITE When dressing poultry for table use, one's attention is often attracted by small, white lumps of tissue occurring im - mediately under the skin. Those lumps are caused by a small mite (Laminoaioptea cyaticola). This parasite is probably the smallest of the mites found in domestic fowls. It occurs in the loose subcutaneous connective tissue, especially in the regions of the neck, breast, sides, and thighs. It is very com - mon in Nebraska, and the writers have found evidence of its presence in the majority of the adult fowls examined at this Station. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 The life history of this mite is unknown. Apparently it finds its way into the tissues mentioned, in which it causes a reaction responsible for the formation of yellowish, oval nod - ules about the size of a pinhead. They are soft, granular, or calcareous and occasionally contain the parasite or parts thereof. The health of the host does not appear to be impaired by the presence of the mite and as far as is known at this time it is without economic importance. The reason why it is at all mentioned in this publica - tion is that the small lumps found under the skin are occasionally the subject of inquiry. ENDOPARASITES Endoparasites are parasites which in - habit the internal organs of their host, such as the digestive and respiratory tracts, the blood, and other tissues. The more common internal gross para - sites of poultry may be conveniently di - vided into flukeworms, tapeworms, and roundworms. \ I I THE FLUKEWORMS The flukeworms, or trematodes, are flat, unsegmented worms. The body is usually leaflike and is provided anteriorly with suckers, by means of which it attaches it - self. In domestic birds not less than FIG. 14.— Flesh mite. (After Megnin.) eighteen species have been described. Flukeworms have not been observed in the birds examined at this Station, altho it is more than probable that some of the species belonging to this group exist in Nebraska. THE TAPEWORMS Tapeworms, or cestodes, are ribbon-shaped, segmented worms. Many species have been found in domesticated birds and some of these are commonly found in Nebraska. Among the poultry specimens examined at this Station by the writers, five different species have been found, and of these some ap - pear to be quite common. The tapeworms found are Hymen - olepis carioca, Choanotenia infundibuliformis, Davainea echi - nobothrida, Davainea tetragona, and Davainea cesticiUus. Hymenolepis carioca. — This worm may attain the length </seg>
            <seg id="p065">The More Important Poultry Diseases 65 of from one to three inches. It is threadlike, may occur in great numbers, and according to certain observations it ap - pears to be more numerous during late summer and early autumn. This parasite is very delicate and fragile and can be easily recognized by that fact alone. It occurs in the small intestine of the common fowl and the turkey. Like the other tapeworms, this species requires for the completion of its life cycle an intermediate host, and it is the common stable fly which serves in that capacity. The tape - worm eggs are passed with the droppings of the infested birds and are eaten by the stable fly. In the body of the fly the egg hatches, liberating the small larvae, which become en - cysted and in that form develop to a certain stage. When the flies are devoured by the poultry and digested, the young para - site is set free, attaches itself to the mucous surface of the small intestine, and develops to the adult stage. Choanotenia infundibuliformis. — This tapeworm is somewhat larger than the preceding one and is found in the small intestines of chickens, turkeys, ducks, and pigeons. Davainea tetragona and Davainea cesticillus are the most common of the Nebraska tapeworms of poultry. The former may attain a maximum length of ten inches and is generally found in the posterior part of the small intestine. The latter is smaller and its greatest length is usually about five inches. It is most commonly observed in the anterior part of the small intestines of fowls. The life history of the preceding three species is similar to that of Hymenolepis, with this difference, that the common house fly serves them as intermediate host. Davainea ECHINOBOTHRIDA. — This species resembles Da - vainea tetragona and cannot be readily distinguished from it. This parasite is responsible for the formation of large nodules or ulcers in the intestinal wall and by those changes the iden - tity of the worm can be established. This disease is often described as "nodular teniasis." It is not common in Ne - braska. The life history of this tapeworm is not known. Symptoms. — The symptoms produced by tapeworms are subject to many variations and those are principally deter - mined by the extent of the infestation. In no case, however, are they at all well defined. They may vary in different indi - viduals with apparently the same degree of infestation. Age appears to exercise an influence, young birds being more com - monly infested than adults and more apt to suffer bad conse - quences as a result. </seg>
            <seg id="p066">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 66 The symptoms generally described are an abnormal desire for food and water. This feature was, however, never ob - served by the writers. Heavily infested fowls may become emaciated and anemic, as manifested by pallor of the comb and wattles. The feath - ers may become erect, ruffled, and dull in color. The wings droop and the birds may isolate themselves away from the flock. A certain degree of restlessness is sometimes seen. On the whole one should not depend on these symptoms as a means of recognizing the presence of tapeworms, as they are apt to be associated with a number of poultry diseases. The only way to definitely determine tapeworm infesta - tion is by the finding of eggs or segments in the droppings or by killing a suspected fowl and making a post-mortem exam - ination, paying particular attention to the contents of the small intestines. Control and treatment. — The first essential in the con - trol of tapeworms is a rigid adherence to the principles of sanitation. The poultry yards and the surroundings should be kept free of breeding places for flies by the prompt removal of the droppings. The storing of stable manure in the vicinity of poultry yards is objectionable, and all forms of decaying vegetable matter should not be permitted to collect, as all this type of material is sought by the flies as breeding places. Fly - traps may be employed. The practice of moving birds to new ground deserves consideration in the control of tapeworms. The treatment of birds for tapeworms is somewhat unsat - isfactory as there are very few drugs, if any, which are of value in the removal of these parasites. More or less encouraging results followed an experiment with concentrated lye. A small tablespoonful of this sub - stance was added to a gallon of a mixture of wheat and oats. This was cooked slowly for about two hours and allowed to cool. The birds were fasted for fifteen hours and were then given as much of the mixture as they would eat, with plenty of water. This treatment may be repeated twenty-four hours later. THE ROUNDWORMS The roundworms, or nematodes, are cylindrical, unseg - mented worms and are found to be the most common of poul - try parasites. They are represented by several species, altho only four of these were observed by the writers in Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p067">The More Important Poultry Diseases 67 poultry. These are Ascaridia perspicillum, Heterakis papii - loea, Heterakis dispar, and Cheilospirura hamulosa, the first two species being very common. Ascaridia perspicillum. — This parasite is commonly known as the large roundworm and occurs in the small intes - tine of the common fowl, the guinea fowl, and the turkey. It is yellowish white in color and measures from 1.2 to 4.8 inches in length. Life history. — The eggs are deposited in the intestine of the host by the worm and expelled with the droppings. They undergo a certain stage of development outside the body and then gain access to a new host by the contamination of food and drinking water. Ordinarily the eggs do not hatch until they are taken into the alimentary canal of the fowl. The worms develop to sexual maturity in from three to four weeks. Symptoms. — Young birds which are heavily infested may become stunted in their growths and show signs of gen - eral unthriftiness. Older fowls are less susceptible and are but rarely seriously infested. In case of heavy infestation, birds may appear unthrifty and emaciated while the produc - tion of eggs may be below normal. The most practical method of determining the presence of this parasite is by the killing of one or more suspected birds and the subsequent examination of the contents of the small intestines. Treatment. — Various treatments have been recom - mended for the removal of this worm, of which the so-called tobacco treatment probably gives the most promise of success. It is generally administered in the form of commercial tobacco dust (containing from 1 1-2 to 2 per cent of nicotine) in dry mash, using one part of the tobacco dust to fifty parts of the mash, feeding the mixture for a period of not less than a month. The tobacco dust must be mixed at intervals of not more than a week on account of the instability of the nicotine in the presence of air. The tobacco dust may be found at feed stores and similar sources of supply and it should be retailed in containers show - ing the amount of available nicotine on the label. It should not be purchased in quantities greater than those required for immediate needs. Heterakis papillosa. — This parasite is much smaller than the preceding one. It measures from 1-2 to 3-4 of an inch </seg>
            <seg id="p068">68 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 in length and is found to inhabit the ceca or blind guts of fowls, altho it is also encountered in the large intestine. When E»ent in large numbers this parasite may cause an inflam - tory condition in the ceca and interfere with normal »wth, while very heavy infestations may even result in the ith of the chicks involved. Infestation takes place by the ingestion of ripe eggs with the food and drinking water. The treatment suggested against the preceding parasite may also be found to be useful against the one under consid - eration. The method of control of these two parasites consists in rearing birds on new ground or ground which has not been occupied by fowls for a year or two. The droppings should be disposed of by burning or by removal to a place where poultry has no access. Heterakis dispar. — This species is very closely related to the preceding species and inhabits the ceca of geese and ducks. It was observed by the writers in the ceca of a goose. Cheilospirura hamulosa. — This parasite measures trom one-half to one inch in length and is found in small, fleshy excrescences of the gizzard of fowls. The writers have found this parasite in the gizzards of chickens coming from three different parts of the State widely separated from each other. Syngamus trachealis. — While the writers have not ob - served this parasite in Nebraska poultry, it may be useful nevertheless to mention it briefly. It is the cause of a disease of birds commonly referred to as "gapes." It inhabits the air passages of the fowl, turkey, and peafowl, and of a number of semidomesticated and wild birds. The characteristic symptoms of the disease mentioned are frequent gaping, a peculiar wheezing cough, and the expulsion of a frothy discharge from the beak. The birds appear to be dull, lose appetite, breathe with difficulty, and become emaci - ated. Only the younger birds experience difficulty thru the presence of this parasite, and losses among them may become quite considerable. Life history. — The life history of this parasite is gen - erally regarded as being direct, that is, by the ingestion of food and water contaminated with the larvae of the gapeworm, altho some investigators have also been able to transmit this parasite by feeding chicks with earthworms obtained from infected 3oil. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">The More Important Poultry Diseases 69 Control and treatment. — The methods of control are in the main those of sanitation. The isolation of all infested birds away from the noninfested ones and the burning of those dead with gapes are measures of importance. The poultry house and all eating and drinking utensils should be cleaned by means of scalding water. The healthy birds should be removed to new ground and there be provided with food and water known not to be contaminated with the larvae. Young chicks should especially be kept away from infected soil and from older birds suspected of being infested. The methods of treatment are not very satisfactory in their results, principally because it is difficult to reach the parasite with medicines or mechanical contrivances and at the same time not injure the bird to be treated. However, an attempt to dislodge the gapeworm may be made by inserting a feather, deprived of its barbules to within a short distance from its tip, into the windpipe and then twist - ing it around. This manipulation tends to dislodge the worms, which may be expelled by coughing. A coiled horsehair may also be used for the purpose. Such operations are, however, not always safe or successful. WORMS AND DISEASE While it must be conceded that parasites, and especially the internal ones, are always more or less harmful, it must be remembered that only in cases of very heavy invasions can they be held responsible for considerable loss by death. Attempts should be made to so manage the flock that parasites do not become too numerous. Ordinary sanitation will ac - complish this. It should also be remembered that the finding of a few worms in a dead bird does not mean that they had any re - lation to the cause of death. Large numbers of fowls have parasites, but they are only rarely responsible for great losses by death. These losses can usually be attributed to some of the infections already mentioned. DEFICIENCY DISEASES During every hatching season, numerous specimens of brooder chicks are being received by this Station for the pur - pose of examination, which are accompanied by complaint that the little chicks after a normal hatching have commenced </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 195 to die in great numbers after reaching the age of from one to four weeks. The account of a great number of deaths in a brooder within a short space of time naturally leads to the suspicion that either an infection or some poisonous substance may be the cause. In some cases infectious disease can indeed be demonstrated, while in others the use of so-called poultry remedies or chemicals alleged to be useful in the prevention of disease may be suspected as a source of mischief. Yet in a very great proportion of the cases examined no evidence of infection was discovered by the bacteriological examination, while any influence by the use of chemicals could also be excluded. The examination of such chicks after death does not reveal anything which may serve to explain the source of the difficulty, and even the symptoms are often vague and in - definite. The chicks frequently die rather suddenly without manifest illness, or the death is preceded by weakness, emaci - ation, dullness, and a staring coat of down. Often weakness of the legs is conspicuous and presents in many cases the features of a true paralysis. This sometimes is quite com - plete, but it also is apt to involve only certain muscle groups, notably those by which the joints are flexed. In such a case the action of the extensors becomes excessive and as inquirers commonly express it the "toes turn up." In some instances the paralyses of certain muscle groups give rise to distortions of the limbs similar to those seen in human infantile paralysis cases. In another group of the cases examined, the picture of the disease is somewhat different and is marked by the absence of any locomotor disturbances. There is weakness and emaci - ation but no paralysis, and the only thing of abnormal appear - ance is the eye. The eyeball becomes cloudy in its transparent portions and sometimes ulcerates. More often there is merely an accumulation of cheesy material around the eyes, which makes it difficult to distinguish the disease clearly from roup, and this difficulty is frequently increased by the fact that the nose is likewise involved in a number of cases. A few efforts made by the writers to transmit the disease to healthy chicks of the same age as the affected ones always resulted in failure, however. The writers have not been able to come to definite con - clusions in regard to the nature of those apparently non - transmissible and nontoxic chick diseases, but they have met </seg>
            <seg id="p071">The More Impoetant Poultry Diseases 71 with certain indications which are rather suggestive of a nutritional fault as the primary source of the trouble. In the first place, the diseased chicks received from farms presented in many instances phenomena singularly similar to those of chicks deliberately fed on deficient rations, which the writers were permitted to examine thru the courtesy of the Station Departments of Poultry Husbandry and Agricul - tural Chemistry and which formed part of the material studied in the course of certain investigations pertaining to nutrition. In the second place, the writers were quite frequently able to observe the complete recovery of diseased chicks coming from the field when they were provided with the feed factor left out in the feeding experiments just referred to. This factor was green foliage. It was often seen that a hand - ful of young grass mixed with white clover, placed in a cage of decrepit chicks once a day, caused the majority of the birds to recover health and growth. Based on these observations, there seems to be warrant for recommending strict attention to certain feeding practices for young chicks, which in an empirical manner were shown to be adequate, and for believing that, from the very first, brooder chicks require access to green, young foliage.
