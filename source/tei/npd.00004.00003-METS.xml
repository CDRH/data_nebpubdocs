            <seg id="p011">Introduction. The work of the Bureau of Latior for the past hiennium has consisted chiefly of the gathering and compiling of crop, mort - gage, manufacturing, social, and wage statistics, ins(&gt;ection of factories, buildings, etc. tin coni])arison with the amount allowed by other stall ■ tistical inquiry the appropriation allowed the Nebraska Bureau is very small and insufficient, nevertheless we consider the work done has been of great value and the department has lieen brought in closer touch than ever before with the wage-workers, farmers, and general public. The maps issued by the Bureau showing the surplus products marketed by the people of the state, have met with great favor and have probably done as much as any other agency in inducing settlers and capital to come to our state. The exj&gt;erience of the past four years in conducting the work of the Bureau and in studying the needs of labor, have suggested the following recommendations: In gathering the data for the maps issued by the Bureau it has )&gt;een found that the railroads and express companies have no uni - form system of keeping account of their shipments. It would l&gt;e well if these companies should be required to make annual re - ports to the Bureau uj&gt;on blanks prepared by the Deputy Com - missioner. The law under which the agricultural and industrial statistics are gathered should be re-enacted : First, because there is some question as to its constitutionality, and the law should be so amended as to provide compensation to both the assessors and county clerks. As it is, they fail to comply with the law, because of the refusal of many of the county boards to pay them for the work. A penalty clause should be attached to the law to apply </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 to all |&gt;ersons ntamng to give the information asked for by the assessors. This should also apply to officials failing to iierform their duly. The Bureau has prepared most excellent blanks for tin- iisr nf the assessors in gathering farm statistics, and has made I endeavor to secure complete re])orts. hut with very ini|&gt;er - fect success. There is no other reliable medium through which such data can Ik? gathered. In Kausiis. under the same system l&gt;ut with a satisfactory law. the most gratifying results have been The legislature of 1^.17 passed a law creating a Free Employ - ment department in connection with the Bureau. Although many |*'rsons have obtained work through the office it has not the success it would have otherwise l&gt;een had the same plan l&gt;een followed as in other states having the registry system. The pro|&gt;er plan would be to institute branch offices in several of the • r cities of the state, these branches to make daily raj &gt;oii&gt; to the Bureau of the applications for work and for help. The Bureau would then act as a clearing-house, drawing on those localities where there was a surplus of labor and transferring it to such localities as demanded it; thus the idle man might secure employment and those needing his services would also be benefited. At the last session of the legislature a law was passed providing for the equipment of certain buildings in the state with tire - •es. At the same time two other bills were passed regulating child lal&gt;or and the hours of labor for females in certain indust- Provisiou should have l&gt;een made for a factory i—pnrtnr who could give his entire time to the enforcement of these laws. Iiebraska has been singularly fortunate in l&gt;eing comparatively from labor disputes of any magnitude during the past four I, still the future can not l&gt;e foreseen, therefore a law should issed providing for local and state hoards of arbitration and liation. so that every effort may l&gt;e made to settle peacefully idustrial conflicts that may occur. Ender the head of social statistics, a law should l&gt;e passed re - ig county commissioners, chiefs of ]x&gt;lice, city clerks, etc., ke annual reports to this office of all arrests and convictions. ts should also l&gt;e made to this office of all births, deaths. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 marriages, and divorces, by the proper officers. All charitable iations should also be required to rei&gt;ort amounts exj&gt;ended for charity and number of recipients. The necessary blanks to be furnished by this department. The law relating to the gathering of mortgage statistics should l&gt;e so amended as to require registers.of deeds to keep a record of mortgages satisfied by the real payment of the debt from those that are satisfied through foreclosure or voluntary surrender. II would urge that you again recommend the abolition of con t labor in the state penitentiary, and the manufacture by the ■ icts of those things used bj the state and municipal institu s. This plan has met with much success in the state of New k in the state penitentiaries. There the convicts are employe* naking things needed by the state and county institutions ilejKirtmeuts. etc. II would recommend that the Bureau l&gt;e placed ujxm a non-pai a basis. In Kansas, representatives of industrial organization he state meet annually at the eapitol and formulate their de ids for legislation. They elect their secretary and assistan etary, and these officers perform, with such other help as ma_\ &gt;rovided for, the work of the Labor Bureau. Thus the work themselves control the work of the Bureau as was originally templated. The State Society of Labor and Industry of Kan is chartered by the state and receives a regular appropriation same as did the Bureau of Labor. </seg>

In panning this investigation -- s convicts in the Nebraska state penitentiary were interviewed and the p records relating to these prisoners examined. An effort was made to get at the history of the convict's family, the habits of the |»rents, etc. Very poor results followed this latter Km ai investigation ; enough, however, was gleaned to satisfy the Com - niisisioner that but very few of the convicts in our j&gt;enitenti:iry are lx&gt;rn criminals. Bimkenness, bad company, and the desire to get money. 0 lie the prevailing causes. This desire, of course, may be f necessity or fostered by thievish inclination. Ientinn is called to the large numl&gt;er of criminals batWHB s of twenty and thirty; these represent 54 ]&gt;er cent of the number. From thirty to forty years of age there is a off of 38 i&gt;er cent, showing how susceptible are our young to bad influence*. I the total number of convicts, 14:2 or 62 j&gt;er cent are men, while eighty-two or M per cent are married. It seem from these figures that married life, the home, and mily, are important factors in preventing crime. Of the -two convicts married, fifty-five have children to the 1111111 - 147.

When asked in (1 to the condition of their trade at the present time, thirty - reported condition as good, seven reported condition as me - . twelve as fair, and fire as bud. There has l&gt;eeu some change in wages during the past live years. Thirty-one unions report an increase of wages, with an average of 18 j&gt;er cent.

Two of the kes were on account of a cut in wages, six were on account af rand for higher wages, and two were sym)&gt;athetic. In nine arbitration was appealed to. ■ Among the suggestions as to what legislation would l&gt;e well the laboring }&gt;eople and various trades, are the following : Abolish convict Iftbor and stop the shipping of their product from one state to another. Prohibit child lalxn- and force children to attend school. legislate against trusts and keep them from immobilizing trade. Establish a state board of arbitration to act in case of strikes. Pass laws which will enable the laboring man to L'et a part of what he produces. Comj&gt;el contractors to be U aiuiiH'd and licensed. Have state board of plumbing, and make all plumbers pass an examination: also establish a definite &gt;\ - of plumbing. Require all county, state, and city papen to bear the union label. Pass a law limiting the number of loaded car* to a train, and coni]&gt;el railroads to employ more brakemen on their trains. </seg>

            <seg id="p180">Crop Retorts kor 1898, 1899 and 1900. The data herein given is compiled from reports of county clerks, based on statistics gathered by assessors under the provis - ions of a law passed by the Legislature of 18!»t&gt;-!i7. This law does not provide compensation for assessors and clerks doing this work although it is undoubtedly within the province of the county hoards to compensate them (as the Legislature evidently intended that they should). Still many boards have refused to do so. For this reason some of the assessors have failed to collect the required data and consequently the matter here given does not do credit to the state, and in the consideration of these figures due allowance should be made. For the purpose of arriving at a fair approximation of the crops of the state, the figures of the year 1898 have been taken as the basis for an estimate of the crop of 189!) in counties not reporting to this department. To these figures have been added or deducted the average increase or decrease over the year pre - vious as shown by counties reporting. Should the present law Ite satisfactorily amended, statistics can be gathered that will be invaluable to the farmers of the state. Efhe prices of the farmer's products are determined by the of supply and demand, and it is evidently to the interest of ulators and exporters to boom the visible supply that they the more readilv depress prices. Kusands uj&gt;on thousands of dollars have been lost to the La farmer because of the inflated figures that have been d to represent Nebraska's crops. It has l&gt;een very pojv ular to make the figures as large as possible. This has been called "Standing up for Nebraska," and the people of the state have certainly paid high for this kind of standing up. Some criticism has been indulged in concerning the number of head of cattle, sheep, etc., reported by the assessors. It must be borne in mind </seg>

            <seg id="p466">434 It is quite probable that a large number of escapes have been erected under the law of which this department has not been noti - fied. Some escapes have also been erected on new buildings which were not ordered by this department. Factory Inspection. Nearly one hundred workshops employing women and chil - dren have been inspected by the Commissioner, exclusive of hotels and restaurants. Many of these places have been visited a num - ber of times. Several suits have been brought, part of which have resulted in conviction, and part in suits being withdrawn upon assurance being given that parties would uphold the law. The department has been able to secure a general compliance with the law without resorting to harsh measures. Not one-tenth the children are employed in factories and department stores that were employed two years ago. Hundreds of females are now working ten hours per day that used to work fourteen. Nevertheless we need a better child-labor law; one that will absolutely prohibit the employment of children in industrial establishments under the age of 14, and even at that age a physi - cian's certificate should be required and their hours of labor should be limited. It does not reflect credit upon our so-called humanitarianism that barbaric Russia has better child-lat&gt;or laws than we have in Nebraska. The female labor law should be amended so that it would apply in a more practical way to hotels and restaurants. It is impossible to properly enforce these laws without an Inspector, whose duty it will be to give his entire time to this work. </seg>

            <seg id="p469">Free Employment Department. The law creating this department was passed by the legislature in 1897, and pursuant to its provisions the office was opened May I, 1897. An effort was made by us to have the law amended by the last legislature but we were not successful. The added experi - ence of the past two years has only confirmed our ideas as to the necessity for a change in the law so as to provide for the esta! lishment of branch offices in the larger cities. These branch of - fices should make daily reports to the Bureau of the number of applications for positions and for help. The Bureau could act as a kind of a clearing-house, in as far as possible transferring surplus labor from any locality where it is not needed to any sec- tion where there is a demand for it. The utility of this department as at present existing is con- fined to Lincoln, and to the furnishing of such railroad labor as may be demanded at this point. The Lincoln office should be located in the business portion of the city so as to be easy of access.. An office should by aN means be located in Omaha. At present the laboring people of that city- are compelled to support a dozen or so private agencies. These seem to do a flourishing business. It is well known that some of these places are the veriest frauds, and many a poor man or woman are victimized out of their last cent by some of these agencies. Quite a number of the states now have Free Employment offices. Among which are New York, Maryland, California, Mis - souri, Ohio, and Illinois. In each of these states they are a great success.

            <seg id="p471">PART XIII. BRITISH TRADK UNION CONGRESS. </seg>
            <seg id="p472"/>
            <seg id="p473">British Trade Union Congress. British Trade Union Congress has passed into history, irty years ago it represented a very limited constituency and a still more limited influence. Today it represents some two mil - lion workers and essays to give voice to the aspirations, appeals, and protests, of the toilers of the entire United Kingdom. Its today is indeed far-reaching. Many of its demands have g since passed into law and became the custom of the land. eight-hour day, the Wednesday half-holiday for clerks stores, and the general half -holiday on Saturday, are now quite generally observed, especially the latter, and the benefits accruing in the municipalization of many public utilities are no longer questioned. In Huddersfield, where the Congress was held, we find that not only does the city own its own water, gas and electricity, public parks, baths, street railways, etc., but like many other cities in England it is entering into competition with the land - lord, and up to the present time has built some one hundred and eighty (180) workingmen's houses. All these things have been largely brought about through the Congress, for in this body today sits twelve members of Parlia - ment, probably some sixty or eighty members of City Councils, and almost as many Justices of the Peace, or Magistrates. The deliberations of this body are marked by a dignity de - corum and intelligence that cannot be surpassed by any delibera - tive body that I have ever seen. The system of public schools inaugurated some thirty years ago has wrought a most wonderful change in the people of Great Britain. And this is true, espe - cially of the men and women engaged in those trades that long ago gained the shorter work-day. To this has been supple - mented the experience and knowledge gained in the meeting- </seg>
            <seg id="p474">442 room, in the bargaining with the employer, in the advantage of travel, and interchange of views. The leaders of most of the organizations in the Congress attend the Annual International Conferences of their particular trade which are held at some point on the Continent, previously selected; not only are they conversant with the conditions of their craft in their own coun - try, but in other countries as well; and so there has grown tip a body of strong, intelligent, broad-minded, democratic men, devoid of that provincial jingo bias that in the past has given rise to those national prejudices that have proved such a barrier to that fra - ternity of feeling so essential to peace and good will among men and among nations. The programme of the Congress consisted of resolutions sub - mitted by the various organizations comprising the Congress, and also of recommendations prepared by the Parliamentary Committee who sit in conference for six days in advance of the opening of the convention. The Parliamentary Committee con - sists of twelve men selected by vote of the Congress. This com - mittee looks after all the legislation pertaining to labor, prepares bills, and carries out as far as possible all the recommendations and resolutions of the jrarent body. The meeting held at Huddersfield this year, and of which I had the honor of attending as one of the two Fraternal delegates •representing the American Federation of Labor, was especially interesting, and consisted of resolutions pertaining to Old Age Pensions, Fair Wages in Government Employment. Workmen's Compensation Act (for injuries), Compulsory Arbitration, Mines and River Regulation, Co-operation and Trades Union - ism. Postoffice Reform, Civil Rights in Postoffice. Inspection of Steam Engines and Boilers. Workmen's Cheap Trains. Amend - ment to Factory Acts. Housing of the Working Classes and Tax - ing of Land Values. Eight-Hour Day, Child Labor and Labor Among the various agencies working as auxiliaries to the Congress are the Women's Trade Union League, among whose prominent workers stands Lady Dilke, wife of Sir Charles Dilke, Bart. This lady spends her large wealth and gives her time and </seg>
            <seg id="p475">443 talent in behalf of the women toilers of Great Britain. She is surrounded with quite a band of wealthy and refined women who spend a large part of their time among the factory people and in their homes, many of which are hovels. What to do with the workers in the phosphorous industries, afflicted with that terrible disease "phossy jaw," is a serious question. To have their teeth drop out and their jaws rot is a part of the penalty paid by many g girls who, to live, must work in these industries. Thous - ands of other girls there are who sacrifice their lives or constitu - tions through lead ix&gt;isoning for the privilege of existing. El these things are taken up by the League, which has done to ameliorate the condition of the women; but alas how it is. even in countries claiming Christian civilization, to laws that will protect the lives and perhaps save the souls n. women, and children. The battle between humanity and ercialism sometimes seems a very unequal contest. Another Auxiliary is the Labor Representation Committee, whose sole business is to look after labor representation in Par - liament, in the City Councils, upon the Boards of Education and Magisterial benches. That they have met with gratifying sue is attested by the number of labor representatives now occu - pying positions in all these bodies. Bother Association that is doing much effectual work in g cheaper transportation for the workers is the Work- Cheap Train Association. Ee various Co-operative Associations also furnish much help e of labor trouble, for they both donate large sun and assist strikers through credit at the store. One very interesting feature in connection with this conven - tion was the splendid support given it by the various classes of people. Lord and Lady, Bishop and layman, public official and employer, all seemed to vie with each other in giving substantial recognition to the claims of Labor. Not only did the Mayor de - liver an address of welcome to the delegates in which he accorded high praise to the justice of the toiler's demands, but he opened his house and grounds to them and gave a most elaborate enter- </seg>

The guests were royally entertained throughout week by Huddersfield and its public men. On the Sunday preceding the opening of the Congress, special sermons on lalx&gt;r matters were preached in all the churches. And in passing. I desire to refer to the substantial recognition given myself and colleague as the representatives of the American workingmen. At nearly all of the entertainments given we were accorded positions of honor, and the stars and stripes were given especial prominence. The warm feeling exhibited towards us as Ameri - cans was everywhere apparent, and whatever may be the basis ich sentiment on the part of My Lord or My Lady there is no question that among the organizations of labor it is a sincere fraternal feeling, recognizing as they do that the workers of all nations have a common purpose and in a large measure common disabilities, no matter what the kind of government under which B resolution was passed expressing good will and fraternal [ towards the workers of France, and deploring the spirit by certain newspapers, and also by Mr. Chamberlain, to bad feeling between the two peoples. This resolution is ows: "The Congress deeply regrets thai portions of Um British and French press frequently use irritating and dangerous language towards the govern - ments and the peoples of these countries, and learns with satisfaction that arrangements are being made for the presentation of a fraternal address from British to French workmen at a great demonstration in Paris, and autli. the president of the Congress to sign the address on behalf of the Congress, and appoints two members of the Congress to accompany the deputation to i he demonstration in Paris." Nothing more need be said to show the broad humanitarianisni underlying the British labor movement. And the action of the British Trade Union Congress and of the American Federation of Labor in exchanging fraternal delegates will mark an epoch in the industrial world and. should universal peace be ever con- </seg>

To the twenty-eight co-operators of Toad Lane who, in 1837, resolved to start a small shop and divide profits among their cus - t&lt; mere, can he given the credit of laying the corner-stone of the it fabric of today. They were all followers of Robert Owen. The community idea had failed by which a new moral develop - ment was to follow the transition of industrv from hand to steam. from home to factory production. The pioneers of the Rochdale system were still hopeful of arranging the powers of production, distribution, and education, when this step was taken, and it must be presumed that they had learned enough of human nature by experience to realize that it was necessary, at least in the initial stages of the movment. to appeal to the self-interest of the workers, and by so doing they were enabled to secure material success*, and yet this success has at times threatened the very existence of the true spirit of co - operation. I -operative production soon followed co-operative distribu- The first start following the abandonment of the coro - t idea seems to have been made by the consumers employing wn members, but they were not willing to divide the profits duction with those in their own employ when they them- *h must bo remembered that at this period very high prices were charged f..r wretchwl provisions by small shop-keepers. :» </seg>

So narrow seems to have been the aims of many of these co-oper - ative consumers that had it not been for such leaders as Holyoke, Mitchell, Lloyd Jones, and Xeale. and the propagandist work of the Christian socialists, followed by the work of the labor associa - tion, it is a question whether or not the co-operative consumers would not have been as hard task-masters as the workers had been The field of co-operative production was in its early stage&gt; marked by many failures. The workers lacked the necessary schooling and business training. They did not possess that self - reliance, that experience, that responsibility brings. The move - ment had been led by philanthropists; the workers did not have to furnish finvls themselves; men were selected for positions they were not fitted to fill. They did not seem to realize that a man might be a very valuable factor as a socialistic agitator and yet be a man of very poor practical business judgment. Kiere was a disposition to leave out capital in the distribution fits, and it was not until a system was inaugurated whereby ofits were about equally divided between labor, capital, and option, that the movement promised material success. In the meantime a new generation was entering the field, bet - ter educated, many of whom had been trained in the trade unions and in the store. Instead of co-operative production being started by good-meaning philanthropists, it had come to be initiated by the workers themselves. They had to rely on their own funds, supplemented by funds borrowed in the usual way. Being thrown upon their own resources they had come to select only men of business tact and judgment for places of responsibility. One great drawback to co-operative production was the fact that they could only obtain legal recognition by registering as friendly societies by virtue of the Act of 1S34. amended in 1846. It was largely through the assistance of John Stuart Mill that a law was passed in 1862. and still further revised in [893, by which they were allowed to hold property and were given the same rights as limited liability corporations. </seg>
            <seg id="p483">451 REPOKT OF THE BlKK.Al Of I.ABOK. Among the more modern and most successful of co-operative institutions may be mentioned the Hebden Bridge Fustian So - ciety founded in 1870, Walsall Padlock Makers, 1873, Sheffield Shear Makers, Kettering Clothing Society, 1893 (gives 40 per cent net profits to workers) , Bermondsey Leather Workers. Lon - don Productive Society (cocoa), most of whose workers are o &gt;m - posed of boys and girls. There are, besides these, such industries as hosiery, boots and shoes, tin-plate, woolen goods, cotton cloth, tweeds, engineering, printing, watches, cutlery, creameries, build - ing pottery, etc. These industries show the large number of con - cerns working upon the co-operative principle and demonstrate how practical is its general application. There are in all, over workshops and factories now in the country. Mr. Henry Vivian gives the following figures showing the progress of co-operative production : MM 18M Number of Socirtiis. 15 155 110 Capital £103,436 £ 639,884 i. »15,302 l.OOi for the vear 160,751 1,292,550 1,859376 3,000,000 160,751 Profits !t.o:tl Lusses 114 2,!*H UN These figures are small compared to the figures that give the results of co-operative consumption. They show, however, that co-operative production has passed the experimental stage and is now a healthy, robust movement. Closely allied to this phase of co-operative effort are certain industries like Thompson's (the weaver of Huddersfield). who not only shares profits with his employees and customers, but al - lows his employees to share in the management of the industry. Mr. Thompson, like many others who have tested this system, seems well satisfied with bis bargain. It may l&gt;e remarked that one result is that Thompson's cl' &gt;tli is standard in excellence and has a fame that is world wide.

This is the legitimate outcome of changing the non-interested hireling into the interested partner. There will l&gt;e less waste, greater effi - ciency/a larger output at a smaller cost; the attitude of the worker toward his daily task will undergo a gradual but complete trans - formation with results not less beneficial to his own character than to the industry that employs him."' Such were the words used by Earl Grey in a recent address on co-operation. The Earl also tells us that the employees of this company have invested 1.000 of their savings in the stock of the company, this stock l&gt;eing considered the l&gt;est security of all the gas stock upon the market and yielding the largest returns as an investment. Surely we need nothing more conclusive to prove the benefi - and profitable returns that follow co-operation of emp', and employee, as well as co-operation between the workers them - selves. It certainly pays to make the employee feel that he is a man rather than a hireling. This can I)e done by not only giving him a share in the profits, but also giving him a voice in the management as well. Let him bear a part of the resj&gt;on - sibilities and enjoy a share of the profits. This will be far more profitable than the employment of a bully . Let employer and employed fully recognize each Other's interests and the mutual distrust that now exists and that leads in many cases to strikes will have largelv disap - peared. Much of the present hostility is due to ignorance, or to the abuse of power on the part of the boss, coupled with harsh treatment, excessive work, and long hours. A prominent economic writer has remarked that much of the hostility will be lessened when employers cease to make a dark secret of their business and allow the workers to share their secret and help against common I is noticeable that quite a number of co-operative societies g the workers have lieen started because the workers have thrown upon their own resources by a strike or a lockout; he employers who force a lockout in the future must even - defeat themselves, for the workers themselves will organize </seg>

If, for instance, the manufacturers of padlocks should refuse the reasonable demands of their employees the co-operative padlock works could supply the demand. Much of the co-operative manufacturing is now carried on by the wholesale societies, (consumers,) among which may be men - tioned the English and Scottish wholesale societies, the former with a capital in 1899 of six million dollars, sales amounting to nearly seventy-two millions, and net profits in round numbers of one million, six hundred and fifty thousand dollars:* and the latter with a showing for 1899 of capital six and a half millions, and net sales of nearly twenty-six millions. Added to these may be mentioned the co-operative efforts now going on in the mining of slate and coal and in the work of agriculture and horticulture. It has been extremely hard to make a beginning among the agri - cultural laborers because of a lack of the necessary intelligence without which co-operative production is not possible. Pthe earlier stages of co-operative effort much difficulty was :nced by the workers in getting capital to carry on their live enterprise. This difficulty has been overcome, for when :s are now organized upon a sound basis they can readily e loans through what is known as the productive federa- This society acts as a go-between in the securing of capital. From the rounding out of the Rochdale system in 1844, we have today some 1 ,800 co-operative stores located in nearly every town in Great Britain. A federation of stores was formed in 1864. this movement being still further developed by the forma - tion of the co-operative unions in 1875. This union stands as the official representative body of the co-operative movement and has grown out of a series of co-operative Congresses started in 1869. Much of its success is due to the efforts of Mr. Van Set - tart Neale, who was for years its able secretary. All societies, whether productive or distributive, are eligible, providing they profess the principles of profit-sharing. The societies composing it are grouped into districts or sections and are governed by a This powerful federation has 4,500 employees engaged in the work of pro - duction and distribution, employs its own ships, and has depots in half of Europe. </seg>

The onions hold annual congresses, select a Parliamentary committee to look after legislation, and also provides for conferences, lectures, education, and the preparation and distribution of co-operative literature. One of the greatest agencies of recent years in this work has been the Labor association founded in 1884. This body forms a connecting link between the co-operators and the trade unions; it appeals to the moral side, for, as suggested, the movement has often fallen short of the ideals of its founders. The need of such an association was felt to act as a central body to make rules and do propagandist work so that in material success the true moral purposes should not be forgotten and the movement degen - erate into a system of small masters. Hence the necessity of hold- Bthe movement to its true moorings, with a constant reminder co-operation has something more in it than a mere altcra - of the mechanism of production and distribution as is usual II reform movements. The press has been no mean factor in spreading the gospel of co-operation : the first Journals all seem to have enunciated the principles laid down by Robert Owen. Among the earlier Jour - nals the most popular seems to have been the "Crisis and New Moral World," and the "Reasoner," 1846 to 1872. In September, 1859, the Manchester and Satford society took the initiative in calling the attention of the other societies to the necessity and advantage of starting" an official journal with the result that in i860 a penny paper, styled the "Co-operator," was started. The publication was later succeeded by the present able publication, the "Co-operative News." ■or has the social side of the movement been forgotten, for year is held a Co-operation festival, where 10,000 voices in chorus, and athletic rivalry is indulged in and encouraged. "For the small annual subscription of two cents per member these festivals are provided with free entry to the great annual flower show at the Crystal palace; free assistance in organizing local flower shows, of which there are no less than sixty; free </seg>

What its future may be no man can tell. There is one thing sure, and that is that it has long since passed the kindergarten stage and is now resting upon a firm foundation. Great possibilities lie before it; that it is destined to supersede the present wage system seems probable. By its aid the hireling becomes his own capitalist and employer, and if co-operation is true to its ideals it will mean much in the future emancipation of labor. *\Vhat co-operation wi do for th' 1 [x-oplr. — Enrl Hrey. </seg>

            <seg id="p547">511 REPORT OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR. E National Association of Officials of Bureaus of Lalwr :s in the United States commenced its fifteenth annual in the Senate Chamber of the State Capitol at Augusta, lursday, July 13. 1899. being called to order at 9:45 A. President Carroll D. Wright, who said: Etlemen of the Convention: Our happy meeting at Old Orchard sday, our pleasant day at Portland yesterday, this delightful Augusta, and tfie weather which seems to have been arranged ly for us, all give token of a happy, profitable session of our body. In opening this convention I want to say a word or two of en - couragement to you. At the close of our Detroit meeting some of you will remember that I called attention to the excellent character of the various reports of current work from the States represented. It seemed to me at that time, and as I have read over the reports in print this impression has been confirmed, that never in the history of the Asso - ciation did the current work show such a complete grasp and intelligent comprehension of statistical science as was then displayed. It showed that the commissioners of labor of the different States were thoroughly alive not only to the importance of their work, but to the importance of scientific methods in conducting it. I can now supplement that en - couraging word with another, which is drawn from the reports them - selves, as they have appeared from time to time since that convention was held in Detroit. EThe grade of the work is increasing. The standard is being raised er and higher, and notwithstanding the fact that governors of differ- States find it necessary to make frequent changes in some directions, new man as he comes in has the experience of his predecessors. He is able to take a lesson from the failures and successes as well, and understand more clearly and more thoroughly the real importance of the work committed to him. This is encouraging indeed. Now these conventions which we hold are not so important in the form of sessions as they are in the interchange of views among the com - missioners in a private way. We can talk with each other frankly and confidentially of the obstacles which each of us meet in our respective work. We can state things which we cannot state here formally and have go into print. We can speak of the political difficulties in our work, of the political opposition, sometimes, to it, when it would not be in good taste to discuss such matters in open and formal convention. Thus while we spend some time in what a critic might perhaps with some justice call a junket nevertheless that time after all is the most profitable which we spend. I think each and every one of you will coin - cide with me in that view, and that we must not think, if we spend a day in a trip down the harbor or anywhere which apparently is for pleas - ure, that we are losing that time. We come into open meeting and dis - cuss the more formal methods of statistics. But in those private inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p548">512 views, in the corners and on the street, we come nearer to each other's work than we can possibly in open session. There is a matter to which I wish to call your attention and which it seems to me is of vital importance. The commissioner from Mich - gan (Mr. Cox) yesterday suggested that it might be well to take some steps toward a consolidation of this Association with the Association of the American Factory Inspectors, and he pointed out some of the benefits which would result from such a consolidation. And before the close of this convention we may be able to see some way by which the initiative can be taken by this body, being the older of the two, and the first motion in that direction coming with propriety from our own Association. I leave that with you, gentlemen. In the work which we have before us here, under these delightful auspices, I think I may claim from each and every one of you that hearty and cordial co-operation with the chair which you have always given it. But before proceeding to our regular work I know you will be glad to listen to his Excellency, the Governor of Maine, who has a word of cheer and welcome for us. I take pleasure now in presenting his Execl - lf-ncy. Governor Powers, of the State cf Maine. (Applause.) Governor Powers then addressed the convention as foil Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention: The State of Maine is indeed fortunate in having your convention assemble here, and we l&gt;id you one and all a cordial welcome. From personal conversation with a number present I am led to believe that as to many of you this is your first trip to Maine, this far northeastern State of the great re - public which we all knew, until recently, was that portion of our country that first saw the rising sun. I have no doubt that you will find here many things that may be new to you. There are many things in every State which the people of that State understand and appreciate, but that may not be fully known throughout the other States of the Union. Hence the interchange of views at a convention by representatives of different States must neces - sarily be beneficial. As I understand it. one of the prime objects of the various bureaus of labor statistics is to assist, if possible, the man who labors. That is certainly an object to be encouraged. We often hf-ar much said about capital and labor, and antagonism between them. I suppose they mean between labor and money, for to my mind labor itself is capital, and it is the capital which lies at the very foundation of all our progress. I have often thought and said that labor had some disadvantages as compared with money, sometimes termed capital, in this, that in an Inauspicious season money, or capital, as it is called, may withdraw and go into retirement; but the man who depends upon bis labor for his livelihood must utilize it every day, or It Is forever Now in the last fifty years in the State of Maine great changes have </seg>
            <seg id="p549">REPORT OF THE BUREAU OF LAHOK. 513 of your States. Fifty years ago all along the coast of Maine were ship - yards. Today the ship-yards may be there, but work in them is silent with very few exceptions. Today our coast is dotted all along with cottages and summer hotels. Fifty years ago the summer visitor waa hardly known. Today we have more than a hundred thousand, and that number is constantly and rapidly increasing. Fifty yeais ago the bails of the vessels built along the coast of Maine whitened every sea and entered every port. Today we have but few compared with what we had then. Yet there are other industries, other vocations which are occupying the attention of our people. We have not increased in numbers. We cannot boast of so much wealth as some of our sister States. Yet we do claim in all that constitutes true manhood we are the peers of any other State in the Union. We have some things that nature has given us. We certainly have a healthful and invigorating climate. We have an unrivalled sea coast, indented with a sufficient number of safe and secure harbors to float all the navigation and com - merce of the world. We have grand and magnificent forests, and I wish you had time to visit them. And while in some portions of our State the soil is not so fertile as the prairies of the far West, there are other portions of our commonwealth which have a very fertile and pro - ductive soil. And wherever it has been settled — for more than one-half of our area is forest today — you will find its hills and valleys dotted ovit with the comfortable, happy and contented homes of an industrious and frugal, and, I think\ progressive people. Is it then surprising that the State should feel proud of what it has done in the past? We are proud not so much of our products as we are of the men that we have sent from this State to almost every other State iu the Union; proud of the men who have in every walk of life taken high rank, and who have filled not only in this State, but many of your States, conspicuous places of trust and confidence, and who are to some extent filling them today. I wish you had time to go throughout the borders of our State, to visit the northern and eastern portions, to visit the great lakes, the Rangelys, Moosehead lake and the forests. You would then have a more correct idea of why it is that we claim to pro - duce strong, able and vigorous men. But I do not intend to trespass upon your time. I know that you have business to do. I think we can congratulate ourselves, one and all. no matter from what State we come, that we are today enjoying an era of unexampled prosperity. Labor is almost everywhere, throughout our Vnion, remuneratively employed, and when labor is thus employed then we are enjoying progress. I think today in all that pertains to material progress that we are making as rapid strides as we have ever made. I think there was one decade in which the census showed that for every day that the sun rose in the east and passed through the firmament and dimmed its rays in the waters of the great ocean in the west more than two and a half million dollars were added to our wealth. I am confident today we are making even more rapid progress than that, for prosperity and content as a rule is everywhere throughout our borders. Some -4 </seg>
            <seg id="p550">514 KK.I'ORT OF THH BUREAU OF I.AIloK. States may be enjoying more of it than others; but we are so connected together that it is almost absolutely impossible for any single State to enjoy prosperity or suffer adversity without all of the others to some extent sharing in it. 5?ntlemen, again expressing my thanks to you for coming to our and bidding you once more a hearty welcome here, permit me to by expressing the hope and wish that you will be so entertained among us that you will come again and that this will not be the sit you will honor us with. (Applause.) The President: His Honor, the Mayor of this good city, is with us this morning, and I take pleasure in presenting t i Mayor l^ane. of the City of Augusta. Hon. Samuel \Y. Lane. Mayor of the City of Augusta, ad - rd the convention as follows: Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention: It gives me pleas - ure to welcome you to the city of Augusta. If I understand correctly. from the duties that devolve upon the commission in our State, your duties relate especially to compiling statistics, or to giving information to the public upon the commercial, industrial, educational, and social conditions of labor. The commercial conditions of the country, we are taught, embrace all civil contracts. Upon the invitation of our excellent enmmissioner last evening you witnessed the highest class of civil con - tract that can be entered into. That part of your entertainment I trust you enjoyed. The industrial part you are to perform today, so far as labor goes. It is the vacation season and we do not expect you to in - dulge very severely in manual labor, although I trust your mental work, your interchange of intellectual entertainment here will be found per - fect, the air invigorating and conducive to the best results. The educa - tional part embraces the highest class of science, and when you come to the development of electrical science of the present age, we gave you an illustration last evening of what Maine can do in that line. But all nature smiles this morning a special welcome to you. And when that our friend. Dr. Hill, of the Governor's council, is to entertain your president and our labor commissioner has the rest of your members in charge, I think nothing need be said in regard to your social entertainment while here. I thank you. gentlemen, for the privilege of welcoming you. of look - ing into your faces and taking you by the hand. I have had the oppor - tunity during my life to be for a brief time in almost every State in the Union, and consequently have a vague idea of the beauties which sur - round your respective homes; and while but a short time ago you in your home regarded that as the best spot on earth. I think you will agree with me that the sun rarely rises upon a more pleasing, inviting spot than the city of Augusta, to which I again bid you a hearty welcome. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p551">515 - Besident Wright then responded to the address of welcome lows : Your Excellency and Your Honor: I believe I echo the sentiment of every member of this convention when I thank you most heartily for jour kind welcome. We have come to Maine knowing something of the grand old State, as we have to call it. And yet we recognize that it is in fact, as a State, one of the youngest in the Union. It was born no farther back than 1820. It came out from Massachusetts, and wag able then, as it ever has been since, to stand alone, conducting its own af - fairs in an honorable and a dignified way. So while Maine may talk of the mother country, you must look and see what she means by it, because literally she means Massachusetts, and if he refers to old Eng - land, she talks about the grandmother country, as she is a granddaughter cf England, under these circumstances, and a daughter of Massachusetts, never so Puritanical as Massachusetts, but as progressive as England always is. We recognize with the Governor that the sun, so far as the United States is concerned, does not rise here in the State of Maine; but most of us would like to know, gentlemen, just exactly where the setting place of the sun is going to be fixed, so far as the United States is concerned. (Laughter and applause.) It may be that in a few years we can say with England when she says the sun always shines on the British Em - pire, that the sun never sets on all portions of the United States. Cer - tainly whatever the outcome of the present movements may be, the east will find itself every morning with a fresher sun and expect to see as clearly as ever the true course for the United States to pursue. We rec - ognize this when we think that this State is the State of good men and women. It is often said that Maine has but two raw materials from which its industries grow, ice and granite. They are hard to deal with, but they mean wealth, and we can add to these raw materials that Maine produces not only ice and granite, but good men and good women, a product of which she can be proud. We remember her Governor, the Fe» - sendens, the Washburns, the Dingleys, and we remember that other governor who showed how rapidly the State could go for one man. I don't remember when it was. But my good friend over here (Mr. Matthews) has been able to enlighten me of the administration of Governor Kent. and you know how Maine went at that time. Those were the old days of Democrat and Whig, if I remember correctly, and then originated the saying, "As goes Maine so goes the Union," because Maine held her election in September previous to November when the presidential election was held. That saying found its way all over the United States; but it has not always proven true, because once, if I remember correctly, vrhile Maine has had her own wars, and* notably the bloody (?) Aroostock war, she has had her civil war right in this room and with her integrity and her knowledge of men and her courage the civil war lasted but a little while. So that it is not always safe to say that as Maine goes so </seg>

Nevertheless, for a long term of years that saying did hold true, and it may hold true again. We honor Maine. Maine honors us today, gentlemen, in her wel - come to us, and may we gain inspiration from her character and from the warm welcome she has extended to us. And to his honor we can say that we thank him for his welcome. He says that nature smiles tins morning. I trust that nature is the only member of this convention that has "smiled." (Laughter.) I feel a little shaky about it, however, but I hope it is so. The manner in which Augusta cared for us last night evidenced her desire that no member of this convention should be struck by lightning, and was impressive. I don't believe that any of you were ever in a place before where they took in their street cart as soon as it began to rain. Now that was the expression of a desire on the part of the city of Augusta, to prevent our meeting'a negative cur - rent of electricity while traveling on their excellent street railway. And at our hotel we noticed the same care during the exemplification of the great powers of the universe. But it is a beautiful city, in a different guise, and a gentler creature, this morning, from which we can take our cue for the harmonious work of our convention. (Applause.)

I take some in - terest in the remarks of the chair with regard to the consolid. of our association with that of the Factory Inspectors of the I'nited States. The President of the International Association of Factory Inspectors is a resident of our State. He is a gentleman, perhaps, well known to many members of this association, espec - ially to those connected with factory inspectorship work. I refer to Hon. James Campl&gt;ell. He has talked with me of the import - ance of co-operation, seeming more than anxious that in our work the two associations shall be in close touch, and to that end I move that a committee of three be designated by this convention, of whom the President shall be one, and he the chairman, the remain - ing two to be named by the chair, whose duty it shall lie to attend the meeting of the International Association of Factory Inspec - tors, to l&gt;e held at Quebec, August 29th, and discuss ways and means of bringing about a union of the two associations. Eie President : You have heard the motion of Mr. Clark, he convention appoint a committee of three of which the shall 1« the chairman, to attend the Convention of Factory :tors at Quebec this fall, with a view to taking steps toward n of these two associations. Mr. Cox. of Michigan : Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention, the wisdom of combining these two national associa - tions was suggested by me to our worthy President in a conver - sation yesterday, and I believe that such a union of these great forces in the United States would be productive of most excellent results. I have been favored with the secretaryship of the Intema - 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p554">518 RETORT OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR. tional Association of Factory Inspectors for two years past, and I have means of knowing that it is a most successful and hard - working organization. Its members come from nearly every State in the Union that have factory inspection laws, and in fact the chief inspector of each State is generally accompanied by from tw&lt;&gt; to sixteen of his best inspectors, all particijxiting in the exer - cises of the convention and contributing to its success. In Michi - gan the commissioner of lalxir. by virtue of his appointment, be - comes the chief of the factory inspection forces, and for this rea - son we are entitled to a memliership in both organizations. Hav - ing met with both the associations in their past two annual con - ventions it occurred to me that it would prove a great benefit to the members of both if they could in some manner meet together in an interchange of views anil a general discussion of methods of inspection and general labor tr pics. It might have been a little premature for me to have made this suggestion, but I did it be - lieving that it was worthy of so.ne consideration. Mr. Rixey. of Missouri: Mr. President. I think this is a much more serious question than now appears. I believe this ganization had its birth in 1883, and, if I rememl&gt;er correctly, its first president was Henry A. Newman, of Missouri, and also the second president, and I hope I do not quote history incorrectly when I say he had more to do with the organization of this . ciation than anyone else. I feel that this motion would give this committee the power to merge the two associations in each other, and I think it a very serious question for this convention to con - sider. This is my first meeting with this organization and I am not as familiar with the importance of these meetings as other gentlemen present: but from what I have read of your proceed - ings in the past and what has been said by the president of this association — the high position which it occupies in regard to the interests which we have met to consider. I for one do not consider it wise for this association to consolidate with the factory inspec - tors association. While it is true that in Missouri it is the duty of the labor commissioner to inspect or cause to be inspected every place required to be inspected under the law of that State, and 1 some other States, vet we meet here as labor commissioners </seg>

I would be willing that there should 1* ittee appointed to consider an interchange of ideas, and determine in favor of fraternal delegates to that conven - encourage like visitations from them to us: but I cannot the consolidation of these two organizations. The President: The chair understood the motion to be for a committee of conference. Ir. Clark : My motion was for a committee for consultation i view to consolidation, to report at the next annual meet - the association. This is simply preliminary and not conclu- Mr. Rixey : That explanation in a measure alters my views in regard to the matter. But I am still convinced that it would not l&gt;e wise fur this committee to go from us with the idea that we are -e &lt;&gt;ur identity as an association and become a factory inspec - organization. 1 believe such a committee would like to have the opinions of the meml ers here in regard to this matter, not in the sense of an instruction, but simply to give them an idea as to what may l&gt;e the judgment of the gentlemen who have so long met together, and will continue to meet, as rq&gt;resentatives of the various lalxir bureaus in the United States. Mr. Powers, of Minnesota: Mr. President. I am a meir! this association by virtue of having been a former comm s~io :er. 1 speak as a former head of one of the bureaus which — ai.l I call it to the attention of Mr. Cox — is entitled to be. and has bee l. rev - resented, one year excepted. for eight years in both the factory inspectors' convention and in this of the bureaus of statistics. Tie work of the two conventions is very radically different. Our pro - blems are different. The work of this convention bears largely upon statistics: that of the other is largely executive — concerned in the enforcement of law and the problems that grow out of the execution of the various statutes for the protection of the wor {&gt;eople. and for the enforcement of those relating to the empl y - ment of children, etc. We need to cultivate fraternal relat- I should like to see an effort made, if possible, to bring the^i associations with their meetings together, so that they might be held in the same town, and at the same time There are thing's </seg>

But from my experience of eight le two conventions I should feel that it would be unwise association to lose its identity or to unite with the other. One strong objection is the difference in representation in the two conventions. In one there are sometimes as many as twenty delegates from a single State, and that single State itself could, under the usages of the Factory Inspectors' Convention, abso - lutely dominate this body by its method of voting, and any effort on our part to dictate to them how they should be represented in the union would lead to serious difficulties. A system of repre - sentation suited to their convention and work is not suited to ours. I would favor the motion in any form that would authorize the exchange of delegates between the two conventions, or that would seek to bring the two conventions together in the same town, at the same time, where all the manbers of each convention may see rthing of the working of the other organization, so that they may act intelligently upon any proposed plan of union or co-oper - ation. With a modification of the motion of Mr. Clark, which will assist in bringing about either of these desirable objects. I should heartily support the same. Mr. Conner, of Indiana : Mr. President, the last speaker ( Mr. Powers) has very nearly stated what was in my own mind on this subject. There are but two or three, perhaps not over three. States that have the inspectors working in connection with the statistical work ; but at the same time there is much sympathy between the work of the two departments, at least, in my own State. We have found it necessary to use in the statistical reports much of the in - formation that was obtained by the factory inspectors. It is use - ful in connection with the matters contemplated by the law ace ing to the bureau of statistics in Indiana, and in that view of the matter it seems to me it would be wise to modify this motion so that this committee might be one to confer with a like committee iie part of the other organization with a view to bringing about me-?&lt;.i-:gs of the two associations at the same time and place where, ii ; t is desired, as it will be on the part of some, commis - sioners representing both departments and who are interested in the work of both departments, may be present and perhaps in a </seg>

And if the motion can be modified in that way I am in favor of the raising of a o 'liimittee to confer with a like committee of the other organi - zati&lt; &gt;n for the purpose of bringing about a common place and time for the meeting of the two bodies. Mr. Wadlin. of Massachusetts: That was the suggestion I \\Ti&gt; about to make. I am in entire sympathy with it. and I agree very heartily with what the gentleman from Minnesota ( Mr. Powers) has said, and also with what has been said by the c&gt;m - missioner from Missouri (Mr. Rixey). It seems to me that the point of view of the commissioners who comprise this convention from year to year is somewhat different from that of the inspe of factories, without in any degree detracting from the imp&lt;&gt;rt - ance of the work of the inspectors, which I cannot too highly com - mend. Our province, however, is the collection of data. It is in no way complicated with executive functions — with the enforce - ment of law, and I think it is well that this is so. But there are subjects of interest to both bodies, and as the commissioner from Indiana (Mr. Conner) has suggested, it may be possible to »r - range a plan for a mutual meeting. Therefore, if the motion of the commissioner from Pennsylvania can be thus amended. J heartily vote for it. On motion of Mr. Clark the matter was then laid upon the Mr. Montague, of Virginia: Mr. President and Gentlemen: We have all enjoyed the lieauties of this city of Augusta, and the question naturally arises.

The huge corporations, capitalized at tens and scores of m ll- : ions of dollars each, and organized to crush competition, to limit production and to control prices, and the great combinations more properly called trusts which are formed for the same purpose and are but the offspring of corporations, are an evil in our social and industrial life, and the monopolies which they seek to establish are no less a curse than were monopolies in the days of Coke, unless, indeed, we accept the arguments of the socialist — hold as our in - dustrial ideal State ownership and control of all means of produc - tion.

This too frequent confession of helplessness on the part of the student justifies to a greater or less extent the characterization of political economy as the gospel of despair, and furnishes the keenest of weapons to those who attack our present industrial system. A careful study of the theory and conditions of corporal ganizations. however, cannot fail to be fruitful in ponthre results. </seg>
            <seg id="p560">524 REl'ORT OF THE Bl KKAl OF LABOR. for this all-important factor in our social and economic life is of oar own voluntary and immediate creation, the product of the law. If abuses exist and intelligence be not lacking, these abuses can be remedied by the same means that gave opportunity for their existence; and not only this, but the usefulness of the organi - zations themselves may be greatly increased when we come to un - derstand and appreciate their legitimate purpose and functions. EMthough the life of our common law has been, as Judge lies says, experience, the organism through which this life iiests itself is precedent. As is the case with the human body, i parts of the legal organism that once served a useful purpose ist after their usefulness has disappeared and become a source isease and danger by impeding functional activities essend? 1 fe and growth under new and more complex conditions of tence. The development of the law of corporations in England and this country affords a striking illustration of this fact. The fiction of the personality of these organizations served its purpose in an age when searching legal analysis was unknown: in those earlier days, it was easier, perhaps letter, for the sake of simplicity and clearness of thought, to attribute to a single ticti - l person the special rights and obligations of several indi - viduals associated for certain purposes, than to consider such special rights and obligations as pertaining to the individuals themselves. So long u this question remained a merely academic one. a theme f&lt; &gt;r legal scholastics, we can look with gxxxl-natured toler - ance on such solemn nonsense as the following, even though it appears under the guise of a judicial opinion — •"None but God can create souls. The king creates corporations, Hence, corporations have no souls;' a syllogism whose conclusion has been of the greatest use to many reformers in making up for a deficiency of ideas. But when we find modern legal conceptions and rules, and modern legislation oonccrnin£ r economic policies of tHe 2re3.test moment influenced </seg>
            <seg id="p561">525 and shaped by deductions from this ancient fiction, and also see reasoned out of practical existence from the same premise, the fact that the historic, legal, and moral justification for the exist - ence of the corporation lies in the advantage to the public to be gained thereby, we may well 1&gt;e excused for an intellectual revolt on a small scale, and believe that in some respects, our present corporation laws are the evolution, not &lt;&gt;t fundamental truths, but of fundamental errors. It is quite unnecessary f-&gt;r me in this presence to discuss the part taken by corporations *n our present economic system; we all know that without them this system could not exist. Until we go back to the days of the hand-loom, of the sailing-vessel, an travel by stage-coach, or come to governmental socialism, pure and simple, corporations will remain indispensable. The building and maintenance of railroads, the establishing and operating of vast manufacturing plants, and the thousands of enterprises of a like magnitude that have made the last fifty years the most won - derful period in t/ie history of the human race, demand, from the very character of the undertakings themselves, such a continuity in the consistent prosecution of plans and purposes, as cannot be measured by the life of a single individual. The immense amount of capital, also, required in such enterprises demand co-operative investments*, on the part of a large number of persons ; of these the great majority must, obviously, be denied the right of any direct interference or control, must entrust the management of the un - dertaking to others; hence from the very nature of the case, to effect the aggregation of this capital, there must be, to a greater or less extent, i'mited liability on the part of the investors. These two facts, continuity in the prosecution of the undertaking or en - terprise, and limited liability on the part of the investors are the essential characteristics of the corporation as we know it to-day. I he theory that corporate organizations had their origin in an- Rome has of late been questioned by some investigators who iclined to look for their sources in the history of the early :s. A comparative study of institutions leads me, however, ieve that in the solidarity and continuity of the family, not among the Greeks and Romans but among many, if not all, </seg>
            <seg id="p562">( 526 REPORT OF THE Al'REAU OF LABOR. of the earlier races ethnically related to them, we find the source and prototype of corporations of every kind, aggregate and sole governmental, ecclesiastical, and lay. But whether of Roman origin or not. it was in Rome as the power of the central authority grew greater, and as the family lost more and more its autonomic character, that the conception of the unity and continuity of a group of persons extended from the association united by bond of kinship, to other organizations, naturally, at first, to those exer - cising some of the functions of the earlier family, such as colleges of priests, and afterwards, as opportunities^for great enterprises of a private nature resulted from the increasing wealth and com - merce of the city, to organizations whose main purpose was pri - vate advantage. Fortunately, it is not necessary in this connection fur me t&lt;&lt; discuss, or to attempt to discuss with any fulness of detail, the de - velopment of the Roman corporation. What I wish to lay before yi ft] is the fact, that in this city whose laws and whose legal con - ceptions concerning corporate organizations have had so much in - fluence in shaping our own views and our own policy, the earlier a of corporations precluded the idea of private gain or in - dividual advantage. In early England, aside from the towns which we have g'» ■&lt;! - believe to l&gt;e developments of the family organizations, the nearest approach to the modern corporation is the church; but the ecclesiastical organization, even, did not consciously base its unity or continuity upon the succession of individuals; God or the different saints, to whom the church establishments and lands were dedicated, were individually held to l&gt;e their actual owners, and the ecclesiastic were regarded as administering the property in the character of agents or stewards. But the ecclesiastical law. derived as it was from the Roman law. on the revival of the study le latter easily appropriated its maxims and doctrines; as a nquence, the proprietor-saint was gradually supplanted by a vague ixTsonification of the church; the lay courts had only to this fiction to clear the way in the English law for the being so forcibly descril&gt;ed in later times as having "no body to be kicked ind no soul to be damne 1 " </seg>

I ' • t\ 1 ' ' r I il Fj 1 ■ L, I v t"- -\ v * ' r I . \ ■ ■ ' ' l\ - Side by side with the ecclesiastical organizations in England there had existed the local political and administrative organiza - tons, counties, boroughs, towns, and manors, which Pollock and Maitland in their "History of the English Law" designate want of a better term, as "land communities." Under the influ - ence of these, to rq&gt;resent which no fictitious person had been imagined, and of the ecclesiastical organizations, we find a new kind of corporations coming into existence, partaking of the char - acter and tendency of each of the earlier forms. The most im - portant examples of this new type are the trade and merchant guilds and the universities, the latter showing the natural pre - dominance of the ecclesiastical influence in the very name, the word uunrrsitas l&gt;eing but the Roman law term for corporation. In discussing these new organizations, the learned wrters alx we referred to say : "The English temporal corporations when they first appear as ideal ]&gt;ersi&gt;ns. appear not in the character of mere private persons, but in the character, we may almost say it. vernmental officers and magistrates who hold property in the right of their offices. Their lands, their goods, are few. v they own is jurisdiction, governmental ]&gt;&gt;wers, and fiscal imnnrii- This is a characteristic feature of our temporal coqxirations in the first stage- of their existence: the artificial person comes into being in order thai he may govern and do justice to the profit and ease of the members of the corporation, no doubt, for no one g erns or does justice without gaining thereby, but it is as much within the sphere of the public as within the sphere of the private law that the nascent corporation becomes active." As in ancient Rome, so in England, with the development of commerce and wealth, the private character of these organiza: was more and more emphasized, but the complete extinction of all idea as to their public character is practically a thing of our own day. Blackstone. writing as late as 1765 of the organizatii corporations could declare: "It has been found necessary, wktm it is for the (kivtmtage of the public to have any particular rights kept on foot and continued, to construct artificial persons, who may maintain a perpetual succession and enjoys a kind ol legal </seg>
            <seg id="p564">528 Within the past fifty years, as a result of the tremendous economic forces that have been called into existence, and of legis - lative action facilitating the establishment of corporations, these nizations have assumed a character in our industrial life that is almost revolutionary. Seventy-five years ago. the numljcr of corporations in this country, aside from banks, was so small, that as an economic factor, they might l&gt;e safely disregarded. the condition today. I can do no better than to quote from an ad - dress delivered by Justice Field at the centennial celebration of the organization of the Federal Judiciary : '"Nearly all the enterprise requiring for their successful pro - secution large investments of capital are conducted by corpora - tions. They, in fact, embrace every branch of industry, and the wealth that they hold in the United States equals in value four - fifths of the entire capital of the country. They carry on business with the citizens of every State, as well as with foreign nations, and the litigation arising out of their transactions is enormous, giving rise to every possible queston to which the jurisdicton of the Federal courts extend." Legal rules and oonceptotu wherein transitions and modifica - tions may gradually take place are easily and readily adapted by the courts to changing social and economic conditions. But when the rule or conception is of such a nature that modification or transition means a denial of the rule or conception itself, such a rule or conception, if it have the sanction of age, is exceedingly tenacious of existence. Courts must adhere to precedent, if legal development is to l&gt;e orderly and consistent, and legislation must be in accord with the spirit of the legal development of a country as it finds expression in the decisions of its courts, if the law is to remain an organic whole. Birough this wise and necessary conservatism, however, an ous legal conception or rule, harmless, perhaps, under the ions in which it was first formulated or came into existence, e perpetuated under new conditions that will render it not n evil in itself, but a source of other evils that will survive ath of the parent error. The earlv ecclesiastics of England introduced bodilv into their </seg>
            <seg id="p565">529 canon law the Roman fiction of corporate personality. The lay courts grafted upon the English law this branch, alien not only in its origin, but alien in its character, and alien in its develop - ment. Much of the law of ancient Rome has been made a part of the English law and completely assimilated. Rut this conception of the artificial personality of an organization, as such was not and is not capable of assimilation or of beneficent tendencies in a em of jurisprudence whose very essence lies in the fact that it contemplates the individual as the legal and political unit. A corporation is a collection of individuals to whom, as indi - viduals, special powers and privileges are granted under certain conditions by ihe State, the most important and characteristic of these powers and privileges being limited liability, and capacity to individually transmit the special rights so granted under the same condtions that they received them; or, as Judge Finch, of Xew York, so well said in giving the opinion of the court in the case of the People z's. North River Sugar Refining Company, (21 X. Y. 582) "The State gave the franchise, the charter, not to the impalpable, intangible, and almost nebulous fiction of our the nights, but to the corporators, the individuals, the active and living men, to be used by them, to redound to their benefit, to strengthen their hands and add energy to their capital." Wherein do we find the justification for such a grant, in other wi &gt;rds, for the existence of the corporation ? Certainly not in the advantage accruing to its members from the fact that they are endowed with special legal powers and privileges by the State, for it is a fundamental principle &gt;f our jurisprudence that all citizens are equal before the law. A departure from this fundamental principle is warranted only when an advantage to the people as a whole, to the public, is to be secured thereby; hence, in the secur - ing of such a public advantage must lie the justification for the ex - istence of each and every corporation. E'he origin and history of corporations support this view, and only within a half century that we have come to look upon as being essentially, if not wholly, of a private nature. Chief-Justice Marshall in 1819 speaking for the Supreme Court of the United States in the famous case of Dartmouth Col- ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p566">530 lege vs. Woodward ( 4 \\ lieat 518) said : '"Tlie &lt; &gt;l&gt;jects for which rporation is created are universally such as tlie government wishes to promote. They ,ire deemed beneficial to the country; and this l&gt;enelit constitutes the consideration and. in most cases. the sole consideration of the grant." It is clear from tlie context of this opinion that the term "benefit" as used here by Judge Mar - shall, does not signify the t&gt;enefit that accrues to the public from the establishment of any legitimate and honorable enterprise. !&gt;ut only such l&gt;enetit as cannoi ordinarily l&gt;e secured through the un - dertakings of ,- 'ii individual or of individuals exercising- only such legal powers, 2nd enjoying only such legal privileges as pertain to citizens generally. This is clearly shown by the subsequent de - clarations: "Charitable or public-spirited individuals, desirous of making |&gt;ermaneiit appropriations for charitable or other useful purposes, find it impossibk to effect their design securely and cer - tainly without an organizing act. The benefit to the public is con - sidered as an ample com]&gt;ensation tor the faculty it confers."' Again, as late as 1850 we find the Supreme Court of North Carolina combating the tendency then at the inception of its rai&gt;&lt;l development, in these words: "The purjxise in making al! 1* .rations is the accomplishment of some public good. Hence tlie division into poJ lie and pnvate has a tendency to confuse and lead to error in investigation; for unless the public are to lie benefitted, it is no more lawful to confer exclusive rights and privileges upon an artificial body than uj/on a private citizen." (Mills fs. Will - iams. II Iredell.) Unfortunately, however, in Dartmouth College I's. V ward, which was to have so great an influence in shaping the cor - poration laws of this country, the court held to the ancient fiction of legal personality, declaring: "A coqxiration is an artificial be - ing, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplaton of the law. Being the mere creature of the law. it possesses only those ]&gt;roj&gt;erties which the charter of its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as incidental to its existence." Here the court denies, by necessary implication, tf"" Try prin - ciple on which is based the doctrine that benefit to trie public is the 1 deration which gives the charter of incorporation the nature </seg>
            <seg id="p567">531 of a contract on this "creature of thelaw" must be the result of, if not a party to. this charter. Conceding that the corporation is an entity, a legal person, the assumption that special powers and privileges are conferred upon it as such by the State is manifestly illogical, for it is the very grant of these powers and privileges that creates this entity, this ]&gt;ersi&gt;ii. prior to the grant, the corpora - tion does not exist; the grant, then, must foe made to the indi - viduals taking part in the act of incorporation. It we accept the fic - ti' m of legal personality, we can only reach the final conclusion i &gt;f the court that the charter of incorporation is a contract on the as - sumption that a grant, under certain conditions, of special powers and privileges to certain individuals is made in consideration of a benefit to the public to be derived from and ••esting as a responsi - bility upon a distant individual created by the same grant, hence coming into existence subsequently to it: a proposition condemned by the elementary principles of logic as well as of law. Again unfortunately, of these two inconsistent views of the court, that which looked to the attainment of a public advantage in the organizing of a corporation was ultimately to go to the wall, while that which the corporation regarded legal personality, was to endure and shape not only future judicial opinions and future legislation, but, through its apparent simplicity, to mould even popular ideas and popular conceptions. Had the court in this. I had almost said fateful, opinion, looked beyond the fictitious person to the real persons whose rights and privileges arising through the incorporation were to be affected, its reasoning would have been, as its conclusion is, in - controvertible, the fundamental doctrine that the justification of the corporation lies in the fact that an advantage to the public is to be secured thereby might have remained a guiding and formative principle, and many of the evils now existing might well have been avoided. It is a legal maxim, that where the reason ceases, the law ceases ; but at present, either the doctrine that charters of incorpo - ration are contracts must form a notable exception to this rule, or the public advantage as a consideration supporting such con - tracts must be a fictitious creation of the law. even more vague </seg>
            <seg id="p568">532 and unsubstantial than the intangible and invisible personality ex - isting so long m the imagination of learned jurists. Mr. H. O. Havemeyer, speaking before the United States In - dustrial Commission a short time ago. expressed the logical conse - quence of present conditions, if not the generally accepted idea of to-day, when he said: "I maintain that it is immaterial to the public in what form business is done, whether by an individual, firm, corporation, or even a trust. They are merely forms of con - ducting a business; in other words, machinery for the operation of business. Compare this with the following, taken from the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States given in 1865 (3 Wall. m the Binghampton Bridge case: "The purposes to be at - tained (by incorporation) are generally beyond the ability of in - dividual enterprise, and can only l&gt;e accomplished through the aid of associated wealth. This will not be risked unless privileges are given and securities furnished in an act of incorporation. The wants of the public are often so imperative that a duty is imp 'vernment to provide for them; and as experience has proved that a State should not directly attempt to do this, it is necessary to confer on others the faculty of doing what the sovereign power is unwilling to undertake. The legislature, therefore, says to pub - lic-spirited citizens: 'If you embark with your time, money, and skill, in an enterprise which will accommodate the public necessi - ties, we will grant to you for a limited period, or in perpetuity, privileges that will justify the expenditure of your money, and the employment of your time and skill.' Such a grant is a con - tract, with mutual considerations, and justice and good policy alike require that the protection of the law should be assured to The continuous increase in strength and prominence of the personality idea at the expense of the principle that the justifica - tion of the corporation lies in the advantage to the public to be gained thereby, has been the result of patent causes : Enterprises win ise main object, at least from the standpoint of an increasingly large and increasingly influential body of our citizens, have devel- I in numlxr and magnitude during the past fifty years in an </seg>
            <seg id="p569">533 almost incredible manner: legislation, shaped in part by question - able means, and in part by desire to encourage great enterpr has too often thrown conservatism to the winds, and. finally, the character itself of mir j&gt;eop]e has had a tendency in the same direc - tion, for we are inclined to look upon loose corporation law democratic in their nature, inasmuch as they offer equal privileges to all persons for all purposes: we are apt to lose sight of the fact that the very essence of these laws is discrimination, the granting to some individuals of special rights and privileges which the sound policy of the law denies to our citizens generally. In the State of Maine, to-day, we may find corporations or - ganized to run clothing stores, to sell groceries, to sell drugs, and, in short, for various enterprises that could just as efficiently be undertaken without any grant of s]&gt;ecial legal powers and privi - -; the sole purpose in the great majority of these c limit personal liability, to avoid that responsibility which the citi - zens of the State generally must bear.

From the national stand - point, we have a vast tangle of heterogeneous statutes which the legislatures of the different states are constantly making- more inconsistent and confusing. In general interstate enmity has thus far been sufficient to pre - vent any State from excluding corporations organized in another from transacting business within its limits, but symptoms of ii'i - ; re to Ik.' seen. It is certainly becoming a question how long this respect for a sister commonwealth that has no respect for its own sovereign power will endure, how long, indeed, it should en - dure. Discriminating legislation would undoubtedly lead to re - taliation, and perhaps, finally to reform, but this road would be a hard and thorny one. ■oogh the question as to the nature of corporations is. in a as]&gt;ect. a purely legal one. it is in another and vastly more ant aspect, a matter of grave economic interest to us all. Many of the evils resulting from these organizations had their in in an erroneous legal conception, but so completely have de - ductions from this conception, the immediate causes of these evils, become established as a part of our legal system, to a certain ex - tent by frequent judicial recognition, and still more by poi legislation, that they are practically beyond the controlling intlu - f the courts. Reform, then, must come through legislation, and that this lation may 1&gt;e effective as well as conservative, it must be based on clear conceptions as to the nature of its subject-matter, on an appreciation of the fact that a corporation is but an associa - tion of individuals to whom, as individuals, the State makes a gTant of special legal powers and privileges, of the fact, also, that this grant can be justified in our system of jurisprudence only on the ground that a definite advantage to the public is secured thereby. </seg>

( Ajv The President: The subject is open for delwte. Ir. McMacktn of New York: I would like to ask the Profes - [Uestion. Does he consider that we have l&gt;een accomm ir legislation to the exigencies of social cases and that we lost of the conditions that exist to the acts of the legal pro- l'rof.

But on the other hand conies this question : What of the individual? What of the people for whose uplifting and enlight - enment and well-being even the very existence of property itself is • justified'' I will answer that by referring- to some historical precedents. Look kick in England when they had the system of small holdings turned over into the system of large holding the ground that agriculture would lie bettered thereby, that larger ild l&gt;e gained. Well and good; the same thing would hold true in Ireland when the tenants were evicted for the purpos creating sheep walks. The raising of w&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;1 and the sale of mutton were more profitable; but what of the people? I say the same thing in regard to these combinations of today. They may [&gt; My effect a saving and cheapen production by eleminating com - petition; but I l&gt;elieve the total effect is to destroy initiativi the part of our people generally; that, really, the logical results of the tending in this direction is State control and ownership of all means of production. Mr. McMackin : I think the Professor has answered correct - ly, and I think a great many agree with his deductions, that the men who are principally responsible for the creation of our large trusts are perhaps the most dangerous enemies to American insti - tutions to-day. They are positively blind to the consequeno their own action. But that does not alter the case. We are deal - ing with a practical problem, and the great question that presents itself to the American ]&gt;eople to-day is : What are we goir ■out it? We have surrounded those trusts and corporations with laws skillfully drawn. They are surrounded with ever) tection. and sometimes, according to newspaper report, doubly protected by a judiciary often selected by the very corporati ns themselves, so that the American people to-day are confronted with a condition of affairs that is very dangerous. Xow the ques - tion arises: What can you do about it? The same law that would apply to the nullification of the charter of a corporation, to a re - striction of their powers, would equally cover the organization of workingmen and limit their activities in many respects. So that the (liiestion naturallv arises : What can the State now do to - </seg>

Can we make them responsible — make them liable be - yond their capital invested? Can we limit their amount of b to the amount of capital actually paid in? Perhaps the greatest evil of our corporations to-day is that the trade of the country is compelled to pay interest on millions of capital that has no exig - ence. If that could be made a crime, then I think we would be making a long step in the direction of rectifying the evils of trusts; but proceeding as we are to-day, with the press of the coun - try almost unanimous in sustaining even the most outragi combinations, there can l&gt;e no other end than either revolution &lt; &gt;r state socialism. It is the logical sequence of the whole business. I certainly would 1&gt;e glad to get some light as to the remedy to rectify the evil, which I lay principally at the door of the legal fraternitv of the United States. Mr. Cox. of Michigan: Mr. President, discussion has been invited. I have been very much interested in the paper just read. 1 notice that our learned representative of the law suggests lgisla - tion as a proper remedy for some of the evils complained of. and we are quite agreed with him if some of the constitutioi States and possibly of the United States, were properly re and amended. To make myself clear I will state that, for eral years past many friends of Governor Pingree, of Michigan, have fought and won victories through legislative enactments, only to find our new laws declared unconstitutional by the Su - preme Court. Now 1 do not wish to be understood as especially questioning or criticising the Supreme Court of Michigan or any other State, but have simply stated the facts. In my opinion the place to correct many of these evils is at the fountain head. I believe that the first steps to be taken are in the direction of amending various constitutions so that thereafter the work of honest politicians and legislators may stand as constitutional law — not to be tinkered with by the whims of courts and the efforts of unscrupulous lawyers, retained by corporate interests. I am always glad to be classed among reformers, but do not want to be placed with the family of cranks. Practical and sub - stantial reforms and laws are needed, and with all the discu- </seg>
            <seg id="p574">538 we have had upon the subject of trusts and monopolies and their regulations it yet remains for some wise head to suggest means f&lt; &gt;r O mtroHing and limiting these gigantic institutions. There are radicals who want them exterminated, yet I do not believe that much can 1&gt;e done by legislation, in the manner that will stand the scrutiny of the court, until constitutions are amended. I fear that the final results of all efforts of legislation, s&lt;&gt; long as our courts must hoid the constitutional prerogatives, as they do — the rights of persona and capital to invest where they may and the rigtits of labor to singly or collectively work or refuse to work. This is indeed a complex question and every test to l&gt;e made in the future, as m the past, will 1&gt;e weighed by privileges of Ameri - can citizenship and rights under the constitution. Mr. Conner, of Indiana: Mr. President. I am pleased with the paper that has just l&gt;een read, but 1 do not now feel like dis - ng the questions growing out &lt;&gt;f it. except to make tv. three allusions to the matter. It is a paper and a subject that we may well Study, and I want that privilege. But. Mr. President. in considering '.he legal questions as they have developed in k lation. we must remember one thing, and that is that the stream never rises higher than the fountain. If we have come upon evils incorporations, lx &gt;th public and private, they are first I 1 back to the source of jxiwer. The ]&gt;eople are the sour all authority and power and they may well modestly assume their part of the responsibility so far as the legal features are concerned. hould not rail at others, at least we should be in in our allusion to the legal phases growing out of public and nri - vate corporations and the trend of trusts. Furthermore, I think 1 am right in saying that courts have reconstructed and n their opinions, as legislatures have, because of new conditions and factors developed by growth, so that an entirely new phase is put ii|x m the law. I think this paper points to the solution of very main things n the public mind, and while I do not feel capable of consid - the question now and discussing it. I am very glad that it ;en presented to our association and hope that it may gi into </seg>
            <seg id="p575">539 a motion to that effect I believe? The President : Not at all necessary. Mr. Power: : I do not rise to discuss the paper which is full Hggestion; but I do wish to ask one question as to a matter which I think was not made clear to my mind. The professor, as I understand it. finds that all the evils in corporate management are from a shifting of the decisions and the basis of law relating rporations, from the principle of a benefit t&lt;&gt; the public to the matter of making the corporation a soulless entity. And he tells us that all these evils can be corrected, substantially, by bring - ing the law and the decisions relating to corporations hack to the principle of the g&lt;K&gt;d of the public, if I have understood correctly. X' &gt;w the whole question seems to me to be thus : With the courts rting from the principle laid down by Marshall, how are we going to get the Supreme Court to change its line of decisi I low are we going to have our corporate law enacted by the I 1 lature. based upon the Marshall decision? Prof. Rogers: I would in part answer the question in this way : If 1 am right so far as the question of fictitious personality destroying the fundamental principle of advantage to the public, then the first thing is to restore that fundamental principle and insist the corporation itself is to be justified only on the ground of advantage to the public. Now how are we to shape our legisla - tii m ? ( ientlemtn. I am very modest. I brought this paj&gt;er bef &gt;re you to-day tor discussion, and if I have planted the smallest toward correcting these evils. I have done a grand, good thing in that res|&gt;ect. Xow. if I am right, and you gentlemen hold that I am right, and you stand for what you believe, there will be a tremendous public ]*&gt;wer toward shaping legislation in that &lt;i Ethe Supreme Court upholding that a charter of incorpo - a contract, 1 l&gt;elieve that at the present time jurists rei the position is not very logical, and this from the very we have drifted away from this idea of public advantage. on will find many constitutional lawyers, and very close strongly questioning the idea that a charter of incorpo- </seg>
            <seg id="p576">540 ration is a contract. I do not. I believe it is a contract. If we have an intelligent public, fully appreciating the situation. I be - lieve that not only legislation, but the decisions of the court, which will generally follow public conditions, will right the mat - ter. The decisions of the court are not like the laws of the Medes and Persians — unchangeable — and I believe that with proper leg - islation, corporation law turned in the proper direction and lim - ited there, we shall find judicial errors correcting themselves. You are investigating questions of lalxir. You are accumulating sta - tistics. '\ ou do not expect ;ill the evils you find can be reanedie&gt;l at once; but you are studying the conditions and in hope by and by that the remedies for those evils will gradually be embodied in positive legislation. I'm you cannot do it all at once. The trouble with most of our anti-trust legislation lies in the fact that it is an attempt to destroy evils while leaving the causes of these evils in - tact. T&lt; &lt; effect great reforms we must leave a basis in sound prin - ciples; we cannot build our legislative house and put it in the air with no foundation, like the coffin of Mohammed. It must have a foundation or it will come down. Mr. Ross, of Illinois: It occurs to me that in the discussion of a question of this kind we should not take up too much time in an effort to make technical definitions of terms. The paper read by the Professor deals with a live issue and it should be for the people, and particularly the men who are interested in economic questions, to determine if they can, what. the effect or results of the system have l&gt;een; not as to the particular nature of a defini - tion, but as to the actual. ]&gt;ositive results flowing from the differ - ent industrial conditions. The learned Professor has referred tothe Standard Oil Trust. I presume that corporation is a monopoly. I think it is the father of monopolies so far as the United States is concerned. He has stated that the price of the very necessary pn xluct of that corpora - tion has lieen materially reduced to the people since the organiza - tion of the trust, and has intimated that a similar result may be anticipated from the organization of other trusts. I take the p &gt;si - tion that if that is true, and I l&gt;elieve it is — the effect of these vast </seg>
            <seg id="p577">541 or what you please, is in the line of greater economy. If the men who are employed in productive industry are to have their w increased, as they recently have — it those conditions and results are to flow from this new system, then we ought to exercise some discretion and avoid catering to a false sentiment hy indulging in unmeasured denunciation. 1 have faith. Mr. President, in the ability, integrity and char - acter of the American people, and see no danger ahead. I can look forward into the future with great confidence, believing that the improvements that have come during the last fifty years will be quadrupled in the next twenty-five. I sometimes lose patience with our faddists. The world has had them in every generation, and no doubt will continue to have them as long as life lasts. Dr. Matthus. you know, was going to revolutionize the world. He became imbued with the idea, handed down by the fathers of poli - tical economy, that there was such a thing as a wage fund; that a certain amount of money or capital was set aside by the capitalists out of which all wages were paid, and while employers might pay less, they could not pay more than the fund contained. The Pr - fessor came to the rescue with the proposition that if you o&gt;uld only reduce the number of laboring men there would be more money to go around, and wages would l&gt;e increased ! The idea was contagious. It set sections of the world on fire; but it was false. Subsequent history demonstrates that it was absolutely untrue. There never was a time in the history of the world when there were so many laboring men as there are to-day, and there never was a time when their conditions were so good; never a time when a day's labor would purchase more of the necessaries and luxuries of life than to-day. Conditions in the United States at the present moment are more hopeful, more encouraging than they ever were before. We are adjusting ourselves to the new progressive conditions, and these organizations that are being formed in the United States are, in my judgment, the forerun - ners of a still greater advancement of the human race.

Mr. McMackin: 1 cannot quite agree with my good friend from Illinois that things are just as prosperous and people are just as happy and that everybody is just as well off as my friend they are in his State. 1 only wish that it were so, but alas it is not! We gather statistics in New York, and that is what I thought thev did in Illinois. We can tell exactly how prosperous we are in our State, and 1 claim that our prosperity is second to none. We found in the three months ending in March over twen - ty-two thousand members of labor organizations were idle a whole quarter, out of 170,000, which means, what? That, if the same ratio held good for all wage-earners there were 220.000 idle in our State, the majority of whom must have l&gt;een in enforced idleness. I am from a State that has perhaps the best factory laws on any statute lx&gt;ok. and ]&gt;erhaps the l&gt;est time labor law, and I have to be a witness to the fact that the enforcement of th&lt; &gt;&gt;e actually means the starvation of the families upon whom they are enforced. I have seen cases where compulsory attend - ance of children at school meant the breaking up of their families. Is that the kind of prosperity that ought to exist in this country ? Is that the kind of prosperity that my friend glories in? If it is, then he has but a very small conception of what are the rights ot an American citizen. And if my friend from Michigan talks about depending on the law in connection with it, surely the very evils of which we complain are the results of law. If not law, what is it? Then my friend from Illinois talks of our wonderful progress. Undoubtedly we have progressed, progressed as no other people have in invention and in everything else. But what has invention done to uplift the man on the lower rung of the ladder? What has science done to tetter the condition of life? Have our wise men. our statesmen done anything to help dis - tribute equally the benefits of these great inventions and all the wealth that comes from our productive capacity? Nothing. I may tell our Christian friends that we have been preaching Chris - tianity, ( I claim to l&gt;e a Christian, a poor one, undoubtedly; but I try to be as jfood as I can;) and yet with nearly two thousand </seg>
            <seg id="p579">543 of man," scarcely a single government has in any large degree brought its system or its laws into accord with the rules of Christ for man. Still my friend tells me we are all happy ! I wish it were so. We are nut. We are building up monster fortunes and creating immense population of impoverished people, and that is the great curse of our condition to-day. N&lt; &gt;w I say these things without any reflection upon our good friend from Illinois or my distinguished friend from Michigan, but rather that the truth may go on those minutes as t&gt; the actual condition of the ]&gt;eople in the United States.

This is a most valuable work I believe, for there is no collection of municipal statistics to which anyone can turn desiring to ascertain the conditions of any city. The first year's report of course will be tentative: but the action of Congress contemplates that annually the department of labor shall rep&lt; &gt;rt the statistics, properly classified, of all cities in the United States of 30.000 population.

Wad- Massachusetts. — Mr. Wadlin : Mr. President, the current work qf the Massachusetts Bureau includes, first, a report on Sunday 1alx&gt;r. which will cover thoroughly the present conditions labor j&gt;er formed on the Sabbath, the number of persons em - ployed, reasons for their employment, whether or not such em - ployment can lie further restricted, etc. This investigation was undertaken by authority of the legislature, upon a petition pre - ed by persons interested in the movement to secure to work - ingmen one day's rest in seven. The problems more or less con - nected with Sunday labor, under the changed and still rapidly changing conditions of modern life, are from time to time brought to the attention of legislative Ixxlies under propositions for new legislation. In Massachusetts it was felt that antecedent to any such legislation the exact facts relating to the subject, in its broad - est aspect, should be known. The purpose of this report is the tation of these facts. ghe bureau is also completing for immediate publication the section of the presentation relating to graded weekly wages issachusetts, other States, and foreign countries, which was 1 in the annual report for 1895. This final section will cover •ations the initial letters of whose names are subsequent to alphabetical arrangement. The regular work of the bureau, including what is termed in our reports labor and industrial chronology — a concise record of </seg>
            <seg id="p582">546 leading events during the vear in the industrial affairs oi the State, and also the work relating to the annual statistics of manu - factures, is. of course, continued. With this you are familiar, as it has formed a regular ]&gt;art of our operations from year to vear. We shall this year adapt a new arrangement in re|*&gt;rting the de - tails included under the head of Ia1*&gt;r chronology, classifying and analyzing the results so as to improve the form of prcsentat-on. In the rejxirt on the annual statistics of manufactures the textile industry will receive s]&gt;ecial treatment, historical and statistical, so bring together, in monograph form, information relati this important industry from the earliest years down to the pres - ent. The same plan will 1&gt;e followed in subsequent years, taking up the leading industries of the State, seriatim. The work of the decennial census of Massachusetts is prac - tically completed. This, as you know, is conducted by the bureau. I he printing of the final volumes will proceed as fast as possible. These will contain important details relating to the occupations of the people, and especially as to the question of employment and unemployment, bringing out under the last named head much new matter, not only as to the amount of enforced idleness in the dif - ferent industries, but with reference to irregularity and diversity vupation. due to the lack of continuity in employment thr the year. 1 addition to the work 1 have summarized, the bureau pub - a quarterly bulletin, containing periodical reviews of em - ?nt and earnings and other articles upon special subjects g to labor and industrial conditions. The bureau is also preparing a s]&gt;ecial report upon that form of profit sharing l&gt;etweeu employers and employees which results in annuity funds, sick and disability l&gt;enefit funds, etc.: that is to funds which are partly in the nature of insurance and partly profit sharing, supixirted in whole or in part by the mutual contri - butions of employers and their employees. The material for this re|»irt is largely from original data collected abroad, where the establishment of such funds is well knmvn. Secretary: Pennsylvania, the Hon. James A. Clark, commis- </seg>

Let me give you some idea of our great iron and steel indus - try. In [898 we produced of pig iron alone some rive aiv! half million gross tons, or over 47 per cent, of the entire produc - tion of the United States. We produced 5. 275.1^X4 gross tons of bessemer, open hearth and crucible steel, or over 59 per cent, of the entire production of the United States.

This statement excludes steel billets and puddle bar, as we do not count them as a finished product Not only does Pennsylvania lead all other States in the Union in the production of iron and steel, but she is a distinguished leader in the production of tin plate. We pnxluced last year 344. - 064,000 pounds of black plate for tinning as against 104,757,360 pounds in 1895, showing an increase of 228 per cent, over 1 We turned out a tinned product of 262,934,000 pounds last year as against 104,375.636 pounds in 1895. or an increase of 152 per cent. We made 44 per cent, of all the black plate for tinning of the entire production of the United States, and turned out 36 per cent, of the tinned production of the United States. We had 18 black plate works in o|&gt;eration and 7 dipping plants. For 1899 our relative production will be materially increased as the enor - m&lt; &gt;us plant at New Castle, with which many of you are, perhaps. familiar, with a capacity of 250 tons daily, was but started at the beginning otf this year. I have given you. gentlemen, somewhat of the details of our iron and steel business and of our tin plate production because if the attention that has been drawn to the iron industry during the past few months by reason of the rapid- advance in values and the almost phenomenal demand for consumption.

I now introduce Mr. P crs. who will briefly give us the plans for the twelfth census. Mr. Powers: Mr. President and Fellow Commissioner - is a pleasure for me to meet with you this day. It brings back to my mind the many years that I was so pleasantly associated with you as commissioner of labor from Minnesota. I am glad to be with you to renew the old ties of friendship and to make the ac - quaintance of the more recent appointees in your ranks. 1 am doubly glad to have the privilege of presaiting to you a brief statement relating to the forthcoming twelfth census of the United States. The census, as vou all know is the most ltnnort- </seg>

The census is. in some particulars, related to lost of the statistical work undertaken by all of the gentlemen lere present. We must have the census statistics of occupations, ml of employment, properly to interpret the statistics of w hich are so frequently tabulated by our bureaus of labor. The ensus data relating to home ownership bring forward new ngs for many of the other facts so painstakingly gathered and •resented by these bureaus. Did time permit I might call atten - on to a multitude of other ways in which as statisticians and as tudents of economic and of social conditions, you are all inter - sted in the plans and work of the federal census. Then there is another side to this question. All those charged "ith the responsibility of bringing this great national enterprise &gt; a successful issue are desirous of securing from this organiza - "ii. the m&lt; &gt;st prominent group of men in the nation who are en - d-in statistical work, their intelligent interest and hearty co - icration. The value of the census depends very largely upon le accuracy of the data as it leaves the hands of the enumerator. "hat accuracy cannot he secured without a popular interest in the ibject and that interest must vary with the attitude toward the ensus which is displayed by cultivated men engaged in economic nd statistical studies such as yours. Were the people, as a whole, loroughly aroused to the value and improtance of our decennial stical stock-taking, called the census, a great part of the diffi - culties in the way of making a success of that work must be re - loved. It is by reason of this fact that Governor Merriam. the irector of the census, accepted the very kind invitation of your resident and ruthorized my presence here with you this day. He esires to have presented to this body of statisticians a brief state - ment of what i.i being done to give this country a reliable and ac - curate census at the opening of the twentieth century. And may I add that so far as that work is worthy of your consideration. I bespeak for it your support in the years that are now before us. </seg>
            <seg id="p587">551 Iii making the brief statement concerning the census which you have so kindly invited me to present. I shall not attempt a ral exhibit of all the detailed facts relating thereto. 1 shall more briefly speak of the things wherein this twelfth census dif - fers from, and wherein it is hoped and l&gt;elieve&lt;l that it will b&lt; jktJi &gt;r to. those that have preceded it. And first I will call your attention to this fact: The twelfth -•i&gt; does not. at the outset, take up more than a |x&gt;rtion of the work undertaken by the census of 1880 and 1890. They im gated a wide variety of subjects. They l&gt;egan collecting their data relating to all of those subjects at the same time. More or less cnfusion followed these efforts by one agency to collect, tabulate, and present data relating to so many subjects at the same time. There was much conflict in the several branches of work and more or less of overlapping and some duplications. Great delay , in the final tabulation and presentation of the data gathered, and some that was gathered and partially tabulated, at great expense, has never l&gt;een published and never will be. The people l&gt;ecame impatient at this delay in securing information for which they were taxed and demanded a change. They desired a census w re&gt;ults should he published within a reasonable time after th&lt; Iction of the data. It was for the puqxse of meeting this popu - lar demand that Congress, in making provision for this census, wisely and proj&gt;erlv separated its work into two I which arc designated as the census and the census extras. The us pro]n-r is to consider only four subjects — those relating to ilation. mortality, manufactures, and agriculture. The law directs that the results secured relating to these branches shall be pleted before any of the census extras are begun. It also di - ■ that these subjects shall be completed within two years from the first of next June. Ji me here saying- that it is the purpi &gt;se of G&lt; &gt;vernor Merriam 1 those associated with him. that the wish of (.'ongre^- in ■;t mentioned resi&gt;ect shall l&gt;e completely realized. All the lieing 1 made at the present time have this end in view, the ttioi] of the final report of the census relating to agriculture, ition. manufactures, and mortality. l&gt;efore June 1. 1902. </seg>

The organization is l^ing" perfected with the idea constantly in view that any object which stands in the way of the realization of this early completion of the census must give way. If any man at the head of a section, or anywhere down the line, from any n or cause, delays that completion, he will have to get out and give way to those who can and will l&gt;e ahle to reach the on time. The foregoing is one very im]x&gt;rtant fact about the census, which I ho]&gt;e you will keep in mind for the next three years. A nd and even more important one is this: In realizing this early completion of the census proper, there is to l&gt;e no sacrifice crease in the reliability attained by any preceding census. On the contrary all engaged in the present work believe that the •nt organization of the office will permit the early completion he census, and at the same time give to the people of the United States a better and more reliable presentation of facts than was ever completed in this country. In saying this I do not wish to be understood as casting any reflection upon anyone connected with any preceding cei Many able men have la!&gt;ored wisely and well in our national cen - hi&lt; work. We are standing upon their shoulders. We should profit by their work. We cannot l&gt;e said to do as well as they unless we ii])lish more and l&gt;etter results. When we promise the coun - try a better census than the last we simply promise therefor what the country has a right to ex]&gt;ect from us as the result of experi - ence in the past. There are many things in the law relating to the twelfth census that will greatly assist in securing those de-ir - abte objects. 1 will speak of a few of them. I win mention first a feature of the present law. which I am to say the country owes in ]&gt;art at least to the President of this Convention, the Hon. Carroll I). Wright. One fault of all the preceding organizations for the pur]&gt;ose of taking the census was the lack of any corps of statisticians or res|x&gt;nsib!e advisi the man at the head, the Stu&gt;erinteiHlent or Director. Chiefly upon the advice of Commissioner Wright Congress saw fit to create a body of five chief statisticians and an assistant dirt who l&gt;ear the same relatiotf in their work to the director that the </seg>

In their several activities they must co-ordinate their labors one with another. This feature of the present census is a marked improvement over the condition of affairs that existed ten and twenty years ago. It will secure co-ordination between the work of the several branches of the census, and thus a greater unity than was realized l&gt;efore. Much of the preliminary work now being done is for the purpose of securing this end. Let me call your attention to one or two phases of this. Those of you who ever examined the subject of farm tenure and com - pared the data in the volume on agriculture with the statistics of farms and homes in the volume on Farms. Homes, and Mort - gages, have found much variation in the published figures. The questions used in iS&lt;&gt;o for the two investigations were framed along different lines, and led to results that were in some respects contradictory, ami in all resj)ects more or less confusing. It is true that no census will secure from the inquiries on the popula - tion schedule tabulated results that will be identical with th&lt; se obtained from the answers to the inquiries on the agricultural schedule relating to farm tenure. The inquiries on the |x&gt;pula - tion schedule tabulated in the volume on Homes, Farms, and Mortgages must, of necessity, make the family the basis of inves - tigation. ( )n the agricultural schedule the farm is the basis of all inquiries. This difference in the l&gt;asis of their investigation will necessitate some variation in the results obtained by the two lines udy ; but by a careful effort to bring the preliminary question - and instructions into harmony it is believed that the twelfth cen - will present rejxirts relating to farm tenancy and to farm*, homes, and mortgages which will more fully harmonize with one another and leave fewer variations to be explained than was the ■f the eleventh census. Iverywhere that the work of one section or division of the s touches that of another, as in the case last mentioned, there •e an effort through the co-operation of the chief statistician he assistant director to secure co-ordination and prevent du - ions. Permit me to give a further illustration of this phase </seg>
            <seg id="p590">554 ur work. Butter and cheese are made on the farm, and thus unong the products to be reported in the volume on agricul - ture. They are also made in factories and are among 1 the subjects treated in the vo'ume on manufactures. The chiefs of these two us must arrange their work so as to secure Iwtween them an exhibit of all the butter and cheese produced in the country, and at the same time have no duplication of product or of capital in - 1. There is a need of a like co-operation in dealing with the r, wine, and cider, made in factories or on the farm — of ginned in large corporate establishments and cotton ginned on the plantation. The separation of work by the several divi - - above outlined, preventing duplication of effort, will k certain degree the expense of the census. It will also ex]&gt;edite the work and assist in bringing it to an early completion. Another new feature of the twelfth census is the building which will shelter its force of employees. The employees in tne ■ith census were housed in a uumlwr of different buildi arranged in small rooms like those of the average large office mg. The next census will see its employees all under one and upon only two Boors, It is estimated that the incn ency of labor that will be brought about by this change will be more than sufficient to pay the total excuses of the rent the building. Again 1 will call your attention to the fact that this i will perfect it- organization several months earlier than has ever realized before. Its preliminary work is something like months further along at the present time than it was ten j It is intended to push that preliminary work with all p ble vigor and by making more thorough ami perfect prepar: prevent many if the delays and imperfections of all preceding cen- In this way. as well as by the others already mentioned, it ped to secure greater expedition in the final tabulation ami publication of the census work.

In the tenth and eleventh ce these enumerators did not know of their ap]xiintment but a few days, and in many cases but a few hours, liefore they began their work. The great majority of those in the agricultural sed never met a superior officer to talk over their duties. They had to de]&gt;end. for their guidance, upon a book of instructions put into their hands a few hours or days before they began their work. Many of the supervisors were but a little better instructed in their duties. They were appointed only thirty to ninety days before the active work of the census began. Is it any wonder that so much of the data gathered by the enumerators had to be sent back for correction: And it is not to l&gt;e doubted that many a gross error thus crept into the work as finally tabulated and published. I mention this fact not to cast any odium upon any person in any position in the eleventh census. I believe that with rare excep - tions all of them did the best they could under the circumstances in which they were placed. Nothing different could have been done with the late organization of the work of the Supervisor and of the central office. I can now make clear. I trust, the importance and significance of the early organization of the census, to which I have air alluded. The supervisors, for nearly all parts of the nation, have already l&gt;eiie selected. They will have nearly a year in which to (earn and become familiar with the duties, where their pre&lt;U ten years ago had two &lt;&gt;r three, or at the most, six months. The work of arranging the enumeration districts and of ap honing the enumerators has already l&gt;egun. and will be complete*' six months earlier than ever before. After that work is c pleted it is now contemplated to begin the work of carefully train - ing the supervisors and enumerators in their duties in a way that was never attempted before. The printed and written instructions furnished ten years ago will l&gt;e in the hands of the superv and enumerators as many months as it averaged days at that time. Further, so far as it is found practical, every supervisor in the country will t&gt;e brought in personal touch with those in the </seg>
            <seg id="p592">556 census office in Washington and given practical training in the work of census taking. He will 1&gt;e shown in detail the work of the enumerator, as well as that of his own. In the same wa&gt; far as practical, the enumerator will l&gt;e brought in personal con - tact with the supervisor over him, and thus, as well as by the printed page, shown how to discharge the duties which be sumes in connection with the census. This training of the super - rs and enumerators by all the practical methods that can be arranged for in the six months extra, which have been secure! by the earlier organization, will. I feel very sure, result in obtain - better class of work on the |&gt;art of the enumerators, the very all our census information. It cannot fail to give lx.*tu-r census than was ever realized l&gt;efore. In this I know you will agree with me after your own practical experience in collect - •atistics. Not only is this training and preliminary work required to e a good ctnsu&gt;. but good men are also needed for enumen- The best of training by the census officials at Washington cannot make census brick without the straw of gcx&gt;d men as etuun - \Ye need these men as enumerators. We need, therefor. the influence of every man in the country who a|&gt;preciates the value of good statistics to bring a pressure to l&gt;ear upon all con - cerned in our several communities in order that only good men be appointed as enumerators. Here. then, is a place where you gentle - men, as statisticians, as men interested in honest, faithful, and I work, can assist the census officials. You can make influence felt in your several localities, with your local superv and congressmen, in demanding that only good men be appointed numerators. 1 have already mentioned the fact that the law calls for, and the officials in charge intend that the census shall l&gt;e completed within two years. To accomplish this end competent clerks must l&gt;e provided in Washington. The clerks thus far appointed, as the result of the examination already held, are of a very high order. I believe that they are the equals, if not the superiors, of the em plovees in any other branch of the public service at our National Capital, or in our State government. We need but to have the </seg>
            <seg id="p593">557 ■gTade of appointees in the future to make of this twelfth I a model civil service for the nation. I will touch upon one point further, and then I will dose. I have l&gt;een asked by many this question: Is the census a ]&gt;erma - nent institution? Is it to l&gt;e made a permanent department of the National Government? I will answer: Under the law. n&lt;&gt;. The country asks for a permanent census, hut I helieve that the coun - try asks still more for a good census, a census that will meet cer - tain ends. Congress has not made the census a |&gt;ermanent institu - tion, and it will not until it knows whether the men in charge of it can give the country that kind of a census which the country de - mands. If the census officers are ahle to hring ahout in two years from next June, the time called for by law. the completion of these four fundamental departments of work, and do it in an effi - cient manner, this department will, in my opinion. l&gt;e made perma - nent. If they are not I don't believe it will 1&gt;e permanent. There will l)e a new deal made in ten years. I believe those connected with the work appreciate this fact. I believe that Governor Mer - riam is the man to bring all the forces into line that shall give the country the best census that it has ever had. a census such as the country asks for that will meet the requirements of the stu - dents of practical statistics, such as are here gathered, and that thus will l&gt;e laid the foundation for that which you have asked in the past, that which we all desire, a permanent census deiwrtment. 6 thank you for your attention, and l&gt;es|)eak from all • co-operation in the work of the twelfth census, in making :t vhich we all desire, that which will l&gt;e an exact exhibit of the rces of the United States, of the national population and of s facts which we seek to obtain by this decennial stock-taking r people.

Wedded to caste, true to the traditions of an idolatrous priesthood, the East Indiaman decline advice to be frugal in vears of plenty. Famine is his direst foe. yet he refuses to be provident in methods and measure to alleviate the miseries or the de - population that follow its stalking ghost so often abroad in a land so abundant in sunshine that if wanton drought did not at times assail it. it would lie ever the richest of man's belongings. "Enlightened government and modern civilization : these are the specifics for famine. Where they exist scarcity will never result in dqx&gt;pulation. Where they do not. the utmost endeavors of government may mitigate, but they cannot avert." (Hunter's Annals of Rural Bengal, p. 55.) Great epidemics originate be - yood the lx&gt;rders of Christendom; within its limits famine is rare and pestilence infrequent. Caste is the formidable hindrance to the complete reclamation of a Hindu civilization to the white man's standard. Willing to accept a western sovereignty, unwill - ing to yield to its proffered education, the enfeebled Hindu mind ding's vigorously to an hereditary philosophy that blights person - ality, impedes progress, destroys usefulness. The Hindu has no fear of disturbance in his religion. Save that he has l&gt;een halted in his cruel sacrifices, his faith is guaranteed him. The Empress of all the Indies has assured him by official proclamation that the State shall in no vvav interfere with his creed. This tenacity of religious purpose in these \vorshi]&gt;ers of strange gods is not limited to the boundaries of the East Indian peninsula. A pagan civilization grown up about an idolatrous devotion is resentful of interference. The savage seems more willing to surrender his fetish than does the pagan his philosophy. Stunted moralities, the survival of fetish beliefs and pagan prac - tices are barriers that will clog the humanities in an early redemp - tion of the Philippines. In scientific research and intelligent travel no American has better acquaintance with that archipelago than Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of the Michigan University. In his recently published work he says. "The total population of the archipelago is not definitelv known as census returns are neces- </seg>

It is divided between more than eighty distinct tribes, which, for purpowa of discussion, may be conveniently grouped as Negritos. Mohammedan Malays, pagan Malays, and civilized Malays." And this is his judgment of one of these numerous tribal subdivisions: "I have elsewhere given in some detail my estimate of the Mohammedan Malays or Moors. I consider 't certain that the nation which would have any hope of getting on peaceably with them must let their religion strictly alone; certain, too. that for many years to come they must be held in check with a strong hand." Mr. John Foreman, of the Royal Geographical Society, in his instructive work on the Philippines, a London publication of 1890. thus measures the domesticated natives of Luzon, the Filipinos: "Amongst themselves they are tyrannical. They have no real sentiment, honor or magnanimity, and apart from their hospital - ity, in which they far excel the European, in all their actions, thev appear to lie only guided by fear or interest, or both." * * * "No one who has lived in the colony for years would sketch the real moral portrait of virtues and vices." * * * "Nor do the natives, rich or poor, of any class in life, and with very few ex - ceptions in the whole population, appear to regard lying as a sin. but rather as a legitimate, though cunning convenience, which should be resorted to whenever it will serve a purpose. It is my frank opinion that they do not in their consciences hold lying to be a fault in any degree." Professor Worcester confirms this estimate in language equal - nvincing. "The civilized natives." he says, "seldom volun - tarily confess faults, and often lie most unconsciously to con - ceal some trivial shortcoming. In fact, they frequently lie with - out any excuse whatever, unless it be the aesthetic satisfaction de - rived from the exercise of their remarkable talent in this direction. When one of them is detected in a falsehood, he is simply cha - grined that his performance was not more creditably carried out.

There is probably no territory of equal extent where savagery, barbarism, and civilization are severally in such significant evi - dence. As John Fiske designates it, "Barbarism is the ernorm &gt;us interval which begins with the invention of pottery and ends with the invention of the alphabet." Civilization consequently be - ginning with the invention of the alphabet, according to the French philosophers, exists in various degrees and is susceptible of continual progress. The savage "is an uncivilized human be - ing, one in the lowest and most primitive state of society." Luzon savagery is not of the worst, its barbarity not the most often - nor is its civilization of the purest. The combination would em - barass the idealist, the situation stagger the reformer. To treat the question superficially, there could lie but the one conclusion — to sacrifice philosophy, forego morals, and let the Filipino take care of his own deliverance. There is. however, one of Gold win Smith's three subdivisions so available in these islands for the ap - plication of economic principles that. w,ith its better development, the higher development of the other two might follow as a fitting sequence. There is no soil of more productive affluence within the zone of the tropics than that of this archipelago. The people have shown a capability of applying the industrial arts to the fabrica - tion of much of this affluent product. With intelligent guidance this fabrication might lie utilized to high commercial advantage There are physical hindrances. Never to worry and not to work are coincidents of tropical temperament.

Under his Spanish dominancy the domesticated native has been seriously restrained. Besides a burdensome taxation, under the vicious system permitted by the authorities a landlord owned everything but the native himself. Himself he could remove, but not so his belongings. The lietterments and accumulations fol - lowed the land, and the tenant's interest in them ceased when he changed his locality.

Through all the centuries of this improvident beginning, the masses of the natives have so far assisted solely by the contribu - tion of personal services. As a fact, the native knows no more of economics as an art than did England after the plague in London.

While the commodity is an essential to the commercial credit, the personal service is but the incident of the one and the adjunct of the other. The intimacy of the two for - mer is closer than that of the latter with either of the other two. It is of remote origin, and land, of all the material commodities, is first recorded as a subject for exchange. Two thousand years before the Christian era dawned, Abraham, as an eminent eco - nomic writer cites it from the Scriptures, lxmght the field and cave of Machpelah for four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. Biblical authority is silent as to the nature of the title Abra - ham acquired, whether the grant was in fee or an easement of sepulchre only. The possession assured to him wtih such public formality "in the audience of the sons of Heth" would indicate that his title was indefeasible. He dedicated his purchase, how - ever, to puri»&gt;ses of burial only — a gruesome beginning in far - off Hebron of the world's real estate movement. Sentiment has no place in the hard science of buying and selling. It takes two to make a bargain. The meting of the two minds consummates the contract, each to do what he has agree! to do without diminution, without evasion. Common honesty is alone the ethical basis of the transaction. There is some senti - ment, though, that follows the soil. It is one of God's free gifts to man — not to foster indolence or propitiate sloth, for with the gift has gone forth the edict, "By the sweat of thy brow shalt thou earn thy bread." Public policy is no stranger to the purpos* that seeks, through a unity of title in labor and in land, a surer national stability. The new and the old world have both been lib - eral in their invitation to individual occupancy — the one to encour - age emigration, the other to restrain it. The homestead law our own country opened our vast western domain to the thrifty and adventurous pioneer; while now Holland seeks to check the appreciable depletion of her population by the reclamation of that portion of the soil covered by the Zuyder Zee most profitable for </seg>

In a letter that found its way to the public print, he say-: 1 take no stock in the cry that white men cannot work in the ropics. They can. when working for themselves." Two recent writers, in contributions to current magazines lit - erature, with a philosophy thnt deserves a better preservation, seek through the subjects upon which they respectively* treat to impress upon their readers the conclusion that the "altogether good" is unattainable !*&gt;th by men and by nations. Of mankind, says one: "The human heart is a strange c m - potind of good and evil — the proportions are unknown even to ourselves; but one thing we may know with certainty — no human being is altogether good or altogether bad." tAnd of nations, says the other: "It happens that 'in the cor - pted currents of this world" it is impossible for men or for na - ms in all their conduct to be governed by strict abstract right." The estimates of the native character have heretofore been valueless. As has been said, the attempt at estimation is a fruit - less undertaking. The application of this philosophy to the i tive conclusion drawn on the native's better side would pro! grade him in that class of human l&gt;eings not altogether bad. His glaring fault is that he will lie. He is vacillating, uncertain, unre - liable, lie cannot be depended upon to follow a fixed vocation. While fitting himself for an intellectual pursuit, he is as likely to abandon his purpose for menial service as he is t.&gt; continue his training. "Situations create duties."

            <seg id="p605">569 either to himself or society a duty to maintain it. If he shall sow and reap and exchange and barter, with the personal independence incident to proprietorship, there is at once a creation of duties to himself and his fellow-man clearly manifest in the very situation itself. There are "cheery notes." though, in all this "chorus of disparagement." The Filipino is apt with the loom and the spin - dle: there is a sunny side for his nature; he delights in music. Filth and intemperance are the besetting evils of the undeveloped races. The hurtful ills of intemperance have been a pernicious bar - rier to civilizing influences. The depravity that follows it is stiil in many localities a potent hindrance to a better advancement. The Flipino is free, entirely free, from both these evils. He is sober and cleanly. Free from the irritation and despondency of intox - ication, he is patient and forbearing. In his clernliness of person, he is a model: in the neatness of his household, a pattern. Civil - ization belongs by origin anil nature to the s' ?ner climes. It is there found in its letter maturity. In the tr ,pics. with the native races at least, it is "an exotic." It must be nurtured tenderly, de - veloped prudently. The Dutchman has been thrifty as an emigrant, successful as a ;izer. His aim was economics.

In the lengthy journey from Pekin to St. Petersburg he thus cleverly describes the change as he crosses the Mongolian-Siberian frontier: "Although their land was richer, the people seemed less well-to-do. Their tents were smaller and rer. They semed to 1&gt;e more eager for money, more on the outlook for "tips." less ceremoniously polite. In a word, we had d from a nomadic and pastoral people, content with thei' Bodes and indifferent to money, and were among a ]&gt;eople so much in touch with civilization that they knew they were poor." They were disturbed by the debasement of penury, but not yet awakened to the refinement that rejects the proffer of the unwill - ing gratuity. Their perceptions were quickened by a new presence that supplied the satisfaction of desires with which, in their more primitive state, they were wholly unacquainted. Their rude speech and coarse life had not prepared them for the self-dependence of personal energy. They had not yet learned that mendicancy is re - pulsive to manliness, that poverty has its dignity as well as riches. An equally crude acceptance of Christianity ]&gt;ervades the heathen l&gt;&gt;rder line. A first acquaintance with the forms of worship is not always accompanied with a proper spirituality, and when it is :it to exhibit proficiency the missionaries tell us that it is times with difficulty that they suppress the convert's demand for tobacco before, as the convert styles it. he will furnish his hallelujah.

There were no middle classes; it was riches for the few. po&gt;. for the many. The poor were held to service, dominated by the authority, awed by the possessions of the rich.

The poor man could have no hope or ex - pectancy of like enjoyments with the rich; the estates were too vast, the leap was too great, there were no steps of gradual ap - proach. What was to be the medium, the intervention of which, would permit their acquisition in lesser proportions, where the possessor of the medium did not control it in sufficient volume to secure the whole ? Abraham applied the first practical test when he converted a surplus from his vast Egyptian proprietorship into money and then invested that money in a real estate operation in distant Hebron. ' It was "one of the initial steps in the progress of civilization" when "money current with the merchant" was devised as the ex - pedient to relieve the difficulties and remove the hindrances inci - dent to the direct exchange of services or materials, each for each, or the one for the other.

So modern legislatures, in addition t&lt;&gt; their own committees, have established by law various commissions for Eery purpose of collecting information mi which the leigsla - themselves shall base their action. The railroad commis - the boards of State charities, the insurance commissions — thing of that kind l&gt;elongs to this theory of modern legisla- They are ]&gt;ermanent bodies or commissions to which are litted the identical affairs descriljed in the laws creating . and they are em]x&gt;\vered to collect the information to guide the work under them in such a way that legislatures may receive the greatest benefit from their labors. This is the modern the&lt;&gt;r v of legislation. Our own offices, gentlemen, are in accordance with this theory. The bureaus of statistics of lalxir. the census — all such organizations are created for the very purpose of collecting information for the guidance and the information of the legisla - ture&gt; themselves. If it were not so, there would probably be no legitimate reason for the existence of these offices, unless the gov - ernment consider them, as I always have, a part of the educationa sen ice of the States. The United States government expends on the average aixnit $8,000,000 a year and employs nearly 4.000 ]&gt;eo]&gt;le in purely scientific or educational work, which has no l&gt;earing and no influence upon executive administration. It is authorized by the Constitution in that clause which empowers to provide for the general welfare of the people. Hence the creation by Congress — and this provision is duplicated in most of the State Constitutions — of these offices, commissions, whatever you please. Legislatures cannot properly perform the duties pertaining to their office without the information which all these commissions bring to their service. B? United States Industrial Commission finds its re: stence in this modern theory of legislation. Congress can - tlertake through its single committee of labor and educa - the Senate and of labor in the House to weigh careful 1 ;.' </seg>

No legislature, no people, no com - munity, is expected to solve all of the difficulties which arise out of the industrial situation or of social conditions. But it is the duty of every legislature and the duty of every people and of every community to try. But before any effective trial can he made there must l&gt;e information which can he relied upon. K Industrial Commission has ben organized for the very i, and for the sole purpose, of suggesting or recommend- Congress and to the various States such legislation as it nd necessary or feasible for the benefit of the people at 1 their general industrial and trade relations. The very :tion of the law. which was approved in June. 1 898, as described by the Commission itself, states the purpose as follows: tuqxise of this Commision. as must l&gt;e inferred from the ig of the law creating it. is to "ascertain the nature of the ig legislation of the several States of the United States g upon industrial conditions, the material operation of that tion in its relation to the workingman and the manufacturer le business man. and to the consumer: the character and of similar legislation in foreign countries, and how far it is applicable or desirable in the United States: and what legisla - tion, if any. along new lines is practical or desirable for the im - provement of industrial conditions, with a view of determining how far it is possible to frame uniform industrial laws, the adop - tion of which can lie recommended to Congress and to the legis - latures of the several States." That is as far as the Industrial O omission can go. It is not the purjxise of this Commission to undertake the collection of data or information from original s nirces. It in - tends to utilize all the facts which have l&gt;een collected by such offices as we represent, and such information as it -.an gain from foreign countries bearing opon the very propositions which they have to consider.

In Great Britain there was the great Industrial Com - mission presided over by the Duke of Devonshire. The results of their work consist of nearly fifty-six volumes, as I recollect it. Their recommendations, however, have never amounted to much. ;&gt;t in two directions — -first, in the establishing of a depart - ment of lalxir. organized along the lines of those familiar to the people of the United States, and the modification and extensi&lt; &gt;n of the features or provisions of employers' liability acts of Great Britain. This great commission, after sitting several years and examining carefully *he laws and the working of them in differ - ent countries, were unable to offer any specific solution of the great difficulties which surround those engaged in production in that great country. Belgium has had its commission of lalxir. created by royal order, in 1886. the Superior Council of Labor. France has an office of the same character. And the duties of these three offices, in England, France, and Belgium, are prac - tically identical with those of the United States Commission. The ideal on which this Commission was organized was that it might result in the formulation of what its father called an "industrial code" — ft code of laws relating to !alx&gt;r and capital which should lie applicable in all parts of the United States alike. here is a contract which no Congress can carry out and no mission can meet. We see in the different States uneven con - f law. For many years you know that commissions appointed by different States have l&gt;een trying to unify the divorce law of the country. There is great disparity in the laws relating llection of debts. As pointed out by Professor Ro rday. there is a still greater disparity, and almost a crim - inal mie. relative to the incorporation of Ixxlies for the purpose inducting business enterprises. And so along various lines there is found this great disparity resulting from natural causes, and not until the industrial conditions of the United States are fairly equal to the economic needs of the people, practically uni - can there be anv ereneral legislative code relating to indus- </seg>
            <seg id="p613">577 trial matters. But the Industrial Commission will make the at - tempt along certain lines. It will be obliged to abandon the ideal on which the Commission was organized, hut in abandoning that ideal it can take up a few practical issues and recommend some legislation both to Congress and to the several States. The chief weakness of the Commission consists in its organ - ization. Curiously enough, it is organized in this way: It con - sists of nineteen members, five of whom are appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives from members of the House; five from the Senate by the President of the Senate from the members of the Senate, making ten legislative members; and nine, a minority, are selected by the President hirfcself, confirmed by the Senate, these nine representing different industries and different features of labor, coming some of them from the class of manufactures and some from labor organizations. Now this weakness consists in this : That a commission organized for the f press purpose of making recommendations to Congress cannot opt a single conclusion except by the vote of some of the mem - rs of Congress itself. Hence these nine independent members are entirely, in their conclusions and their suggestions and rec - ommendations, at the mercy of members of the very body to whom they are to make their recommendations. This, to my mind, is a very great source of weakness in the organization of the Industrial Commission, and in the end will probably defeat any explicit or valuable recommendation; because when you take nineteen men. representing various parties and various interests, and expect them to agree upon a bill to be recommended for any specific purpose of industrial affairs, the expectation itself will fail. If you should find even that the nine presidential members were ."greed upon certain measures to be recommended, they would run up against the obstacle of the legislative members, who could, if they pleased, defeat any recommendation. The Commission itself in its personnel is fairly constructive. In all probability the members could have been better selected. That is true of every organization. But it must be remembered that, so far as the President is concerned, he was limited in the law to certain elements of the population from which to draw ■ </seg>

Nevertheless, those objections, he has been fairly successful in putting into Commission a body of men whom I believe to be, on the e. men of integrity, of foresight, and of willingness, each live some of his own predilections for the sake of harmoni - vork of the whole Commission. The Commission is organized into several sub-commissions — on agriculture, one on manufactures and general business. one on mining industry, and one on transportation. Each of th- se sub-commissions are industriously at work in collecting in - latton, or rather opinions, and in collating the great 1&gt; id) of •nets which are at their hands for the purpose of making rec - • m.nendatioiis to the general Commission. Now what can this Commission do, problematically? This is the great question. Is there any good to come out of its work' What features can it take up practically ? It will have a mass of information which will make a library of itself. Each class must be edited tor its res]&gt;ective sub-commission, and then it must be laid before the general Commission, and each sub-commission convince the whole body of the correctness of its own conclusi'&gt;n&lt; pretty difficult task, gentlemen. It is now at work trying t&lt;~&gt; formulate some general measure relating &lt;o convict labor and the regulation of it in the different States, to overcome the difficulties presented by the Constitution itself, matters with which you are very familiar. And it may 1&gt;e able on this point to find some practical measure which will relieve the public mind of whatever prejudice may exist — and it is in places very great — against the employment of convicts in industrial affairs, without destroying the morals of the prisoners, which depends very largely upon the.r employment in some useful work. Here is a prolific field for the .mission, in which it is probably more likely to meet with CM than in any other, with ]&gt;erhaps one exception, and that relates to the sweating system. The sweating system is not uni - versal in this country, but it is found in some cities in a very ag - gravated degree, and the Commission is collecting the informa - tion relating to the experience of the different States, taking up </seg>
            <seg id="p615">579 REPORT OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR. the excellent work of the States of New York, Massachusetts, and other States in trying to prevent the evils of the sweating system, and it may be able to formulate some practical bill which will be adopted. It can also take up the matter of the employ - ment bureau, which is of very great importance in arresting some of the evils which we have seen growing up. Its most stupen - dous work, perhaps, relates to trusts, and the Commission has embarked upon a voyage of discovery in this respect; but whether it will discover anything or not remains to be seen. It has set sail, however, and it has selected as its mediating agent Professor J. W. Jenks. of Cornell University, a gentleman thoroughly ac - quainted with the whole question of trusts. It did start out with a project which probably would have resulted in the disruption of the Commission itself. The Commission has seen a great light in this direction, and is now confining its work to the collection of facts, and the collection of facts should be preliminary to any important reform work, no matter what direction that work may take. The Commission now understands this feature. But here is the point to which I referred yesterday : What can these bureaus do, without perhaps any intention of doing it, to a this Commission, or if not the Commission itself, to assist some - body in solving some of the difficulties — not all of them — which surround the trust question ? You can do this : One of the most important elements of fact upon which the Commission or any - body else, must work in formulating legislation relative to the trust question lies in the conditions of each industry prior to the organization of the trust and subsequent thereto; whether the trusts have had any effect upon the stability of labor or the rates of wages or the prices of commodities. Nobody cares much about the trusts. The people care nothing about them, unless the trusts in their methods of operation injuriously affect them. Now. are prices reduced or raised? Are wages increased or lowered? Is there a greater employment of labor or a less? These are sim - ple facts which can be determined only by investigation of the conditions surrounding each industry comprehended by that trust prior to the organization thereof and the condition since it ganization. Are there more people employed in the iron and steel </seg>
            <seg id="p616">580 REPORT OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR. business now, as compared with the number before the trust? Are the wages paid greater or less? Are the prices of commodi - ties affected ? These are the vital matters which affect the people at large. 1 hey are not interested particularly in the regulation of trusts: that is a governmental affair. But when the organization industries under a trust form affects the individual con - sumer, then it becomes something of interest to him. The Industrial Commission must depend for these facts upon the reports which you have made in the past and those which will be made in the future relative to the conditions of the very industries themselves that are concerned in a trust organization. They may find some methtxl, under the provisions of the Consti - tution relating to commerce among the States, whereby they can bring these trusts into the same position that the Interstate Com - merce Commission has brought the railroads with respect to the uniformity of rates. The reports will place the responsibility ■where, so that the people at large may know the facts which surround these organizations. This is the governmental side of it. as compared to that of the consumer. So that the Commission, if it is wise, may be able to formulate some line of legislation which will assist, first in understanding what the trust is really doing, and. secondly, if it knows how, to regulate it. There are various other features which the Commission will take up, of course: but. to my mind, the two most valuable result? which can possibly grow out of the work of the Commissior re - late first to the psychological value of the statistical matter. We. gentlemen, deal with the facts. We are not much in the habit nsidering the forces which make the facts. We are not much concerned with the mental attitude which lies underneath the facts wh):h we collect. It is a difficult thing to apply a statistical method to motives. We can apply the statistical method to the results of motive, to the acts of men. to business transactions, p.nd all that class of information : but when we undertake to apply it psychologically to the motive side which leads to statistical de - velopment, we find the method either fails or is so difficult t - apply that we are obliged to let it alone. The Industrial Commis- </seg>
            <seg id="p617">581 does not undertake, as I have intimated, to cover work we are covering. It is in no sense antagonistic to our work. It is sup - plemental to it. Its duty is to look beneath the great body of facts which come to it and ascertain, if possible, the social, the economical, the industrial conditions that lead to the facts which were reported to it. We do it occasionally. We do it when called upon. We would be glad to do it more. But we are not organized for the purpose of philosophical discussion. The Com - mission is organized as much for that as anything else. So there must be a value in the work of this Commission Bu' second, the greatest work after all, or the greatest value coming frrm it, must be considered as negative. When people who have .'-•ilutions to recommend, legislation to urge which they think will straighten out all the incongruities of society and bring hap - jvi.oss to mankind, they may find, after two or three years of studious investigation by this Commission, and with an oppor - tunity to each man of presenting his solution or his panacea for the ills which beset us, that they cannot be carried into execution. The clearing of the air by the statistics of the Commission if honestly collected and impartially given to the public, will be its greatest, but its negative value, or the negative value of its work. I believe the members thoroughly understand this, and that each and every man is honestly endeavoring to find some way by which the Commission can be of the greatest possible value to the com - munity at large. It will fail here and there. It will fail gener - ally, gentlemen. But if it succeed in any one thing, if it succeed in allaying the suspicious attitude which exists between the wage receivers on the one hand and the wage payers on the other, the value of its work cannot be estimated in dollars and cents. We all know that the chief cause of the difficulties which come be - tween the employer and the employee is that of suspicion. Each suspects the other of some motive reaching to some action which will be detrimental to its own interest. The work of the Com - mission can do much to remove this suspicious attitude, or rather to modify it, if not more than that. And if it can convince both employer and employee that each has a perfect right to know the conditions of the industry in which they are interested, that the </seg>
            <seg id="p618">582 Ewho receives two dollars a day has just as good a right to : two dollars and a half a day as the man who is getting fifty sand dollars income has a right to want seventy-five thousand — if you can once get that principle instilled into the minds of employers and employees, you will reduce the number of strikes and increase the prosperity of all concerned. That is the fair, honest, business attitude which many manufacturers and many woriringmen are taking at the present time, and if the considera - tions of the Commissii &gt;n can bring this feature to the attention of the people, not through legislation perhaps, but through informa - tion, it will have accomplished a great work and be worth far more than it has cost. We know how strikes originate. Some of you have read "David Harum.'" Old David said, you know, that the golden rule of the horse trader is to do unto the other fellow as you think he ■ &gt;ing to do unto you. and do it first. Many strikes are the result of the practical application of that rule. Lockouts are often ordered to get ahead of the striker. Strikes are often ordered to get ahead of the lockout. Each tries to see what the other fellow is going to do, and do it first. That is the suspicious attitude to which I have referred, and the considerations and the recommendations and the work of the Commission can do much toward enlightening the public relative to solutions and the practical application of those principles which avoid legislation in the solving of industrial and social problems. I believe in the Commission, although I am satisfied, as I have said, that it will fail in many directions. If it succeeds in one or more, we can be grateful for its existence. Mr. Cox, of Michigan: Mr. President, the industrial com - mission can discuss and handle what this body representing vari - ous State bureaus cannot consistently do. A member hf re does not feel at liberty to criticise the officers and laws of the other States. We have manufacturing institutions in our State that are now seriously affected and injured by the lack of more perfect labor and factory inspection laws in some other States. Such matters could and should be taken up and investigated by the industrial </seg>
            <seg id="p619">583 commission, where there is perfect liberty to make criticisms and suggest remedies. Aa an illustration we have factories that are attempting to maintain union and living waees in their institutions, who must meet the competition of manufacturers in the South that employ principally women and child lalx&gt;r. We have been thorough in enforcing the child labor laws of Michigan, and to-day there are bat very few working who are under the age limit of our laws regulating the employment of women and children. In our offi - cial correspondence we have recently received a circular letter sent out by one State bureau asking manufacturers to come into their State and invest as they had no factory inspection or child labor laws. Without going further into details or illustrations. it is plain to be seen what must virtually be the finish of honest and well meaning manufacturers of any one State, if those of an - other are permitted to run their institutions with women and children regardless of hours, age or other regulations that we are compelled to enforce, while they have none to observe. My opin - ion is that there are plenty of just such industrial matters that should be taken up and investigated by this commission. The President : It is already taking up the matter. |[r. Clark : With the consent of the Association I desire to from the table the motion made yesterday relating to the ig of a committee to communicate with the Factory Inspect - \ssociation.

Mr. Clark : I now desire to withdraw the motion and pre - sent the following: That a committee, to be constituted of the president of this Association, who shall be chairman, and two members of the Association, to be selected by the chair, be ap - pointed to convey to the Association of Factory Inspectors, at their session to be held in Quebec, August 29th, the fraternal greetings of this Association, and discuss with that Association such proposition as may seem feasible as helping to secure a closer relationship betwen the two Associations, and make report to this Association for its consideration at its next annual meeting. </seg>

I have been greatly interested in the changes which some of you have noted in the work in your respective bu - reaus, increasing thereby their efficiency; and a most gratifying feature, which you note is as to the appropriations put at your disposal. These matters mean an interest of the people of your States in the work of your bureaus, and it is excedingly gratify - ing to know that when the Governor of a State has recommended the abolition of a bureau it has been rehabilitated with more money and greater power. Let this lie the watchword for the whole country, and then these bureaus will present a greater strength ?nd better front and their work be more efficient. I do not wish to omit an expression of my appreciation of the services of the force of attaches at this capitol. They have been attentive to our wants.

With the advent of machinery and the discovery of easier methods "f production, came a change, not only in the character of the industry itself, but in the personnel of its craftsmen. The growing wants of the world demanded a more rapid development of our mineral resources, competition increased, and with it disappeared the old line tradesmen. They were gradually hut effectively driven out and their places filled by a class of men mostly from Southern Europe, whose social necessities were nut as numerous and whose wage demand much less exacting. It can be said to the everlasting credit of the English-speaking workman that he instinctively resists any readjustment involving an impairment of his earning capacity or reducing the measure of his comforts.

To resist this force and perfect the other policy, liberal inducements were offered to a certain class of European workmen, whose meagre necessities made it compara - tively easy to comply with their moderate wage demands. </seg>

It was assumed that the substitution of the new for the old workman would not only reduce the former wage standard, but destroy the possibility of future resistance by rendering more difficult the success of organized effort. Thus the process of dis - placement continued until fully 50 per cent, of the workers in and around the mines are men who are almost strangers to the English tongue, many of whom have but recently, and in most instances imperfectly, learned the new and less difficult art of producing coal. Those responsible for this change in the person - nel of the mining fraternity have had occasion in late years to learn the important, though painful lesson, that while wholesale" importations of cheaper labor served the temporary purpose of breaking the high American wage line, their potentialities in the way of subsequent assimilation had not been thoroughly consid - ered, and the later consciousness of the purpose for which they had been used created in time a somewhat vindictive reaction, which, encouraged by the remaining influence of those they super - seded, is now expressing itself in persistent organized demands for better conditions of employment. I scent experience demonstrates that this force is capable of mobilized and that it can be relied upon to co-operate with iler miners in support of the last argument, namely, the right ike. This early and rather unexpected condition, viewed the wage-earner's standpoint, renders the future of the craft hopeful than it could otherwise be considered, and demands responsive action on the part of the employers. It is only within the past two years that the non-English speaking miners could be induced to join hands with the few who. during all the changing conditions, have endeavored to maintain at least the form of an organization. Those who in the past had been responsible for reductions in wages. l&gt;ecame most vociferous in their demands for increased compensation. Reached through the medium of an interpreter, their organization was rapidly con - summated, and to their interest and activity in the notable sus - pension of 1897. which embraced four of the great coal produc - ing States of the nation, and included over 200.000 men. is due in part, the advance in wages and the adoption of the shorter </seg>

As a direct result of that effort, wages in the mining centres of the country have been advanced over 30 per cent. A uniform work - day of eight hours established: the institution of interstate con - ventions ; the recognition of the union, and many other important concessions obtained. Surrounded by the most adverse circum - stances, no trade has so rapidly improved its general condition in such a short period of time. It should provoke no disappointment to know that these changes have occurred in violation of every rule promulgated by the old professors of political economy. We have learned wit'i what veneration the fathers laid down the old doctrine of the "iron law of wages." and have heard the younger advocates of our own generation eloquently proclaiming that wages, like all other forms of value, were governed by the law of supply and demand : that wages must decline in proportion as the supply ex - ceeds demand. It is a pleasant discovery to destroy a theory with the force of a fact, particularly when the fact means more comfort for the toilers of the world. If there was any warrant for the theories with which the names of many learned men are associated, the tendencies in this industry should have manifested themselves in the opposite direction. It is safe to say that we have two coal miners for every one that is needed to do the work. We found f r&lt; &gt;m returns made to our bureau last year that the capacity of the 811 coal plants in Illinois, with present equipment running full time, could produce forty-two million tons of coal, which is twen - ty-two millions tons more than we have heretofore been able t" find a market for during any one year. There are no exceptional conditions in Illinois, and it i - to presume that a similar ratio of product to market consumption would obtain throughout the other coal fields of the country. When we consider that nearly 400.000 men are employed in and around the mines of this country, the great majority of whom have participated in the advantages resulting from a substantial increase in wages and improved terms of employment, we can </seg>
            <seg id="p628">592 appreciate the scope of the movement and the influences that are making for better times. These changes, however, have not been secured without some regrettable results. The tragedies that occurred at Virden and Pana in our State are among the painful reminders of the great battle that was waged and won in the interest of the delvers in the mines. Stubborn resistance offered by a few coal companies who refused to comply with the scale or recognize the authority of the interstate convention fixing the same, served to call atten - tion to the defects in our former arbitration law. The previous act was so entirely voluntary in its provisions as to be absolutelv ineffective in cases where the difficulty had reached the strike stage. At the late session of the General Assembly it was amend - ed so as to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, etc.. and where both parties to a contest petition the board for a settlement, a refusal on the part of either, subjects them to punishment otherwise than by imprisonment. As a re - sult of our late experiences with local labor difficulties, there is a growing conviction that legislation, so far as it can reach the question, should be very exacting, many even going so far as to favor an act compelling arbitration and compliance with its d; cisions. I have always opposed this method of adjusting wage disputes, principally from the consideration that there should be no legal abridgment of the laborers' privilege to work or remain idle, as he may elect. Yet we cannot close our eyes to the rights and interests of the community. Where a local dispute, as in the case at Pana, extending over a period of fourteen months, and where its effect has operated to injure every business inter - est; where families and churches have been divided, and life, in a certain measure rendered unsafe, the situation, in the interest of the general public, demands the application of more drastic measures. The Pana coal companies refused until recently to consider any proposal to arbitrate, and endeavored to sustain their posi - tion with the obsolete argument that the books of their companies were private property which the State had no right to examine, forgetting, seeminglv. that in declining to make an exhibit they </seg>

Certain legislation, of course, is a necessity, but we cannot sup)x&gt;se. without impeaching our better judgment, that the cause of the people, and particularly that numerous class de - pending on work and wages, can be materially promoted through the agency of legal enactment. The spirit of modern discontent cannot be removed by legislation, and it is perhaps best that it cannot. This statement is made without apology to the followers of certain theorists who tempt us with visions of the millenium. and promise the utter extinction of all poverty and oppression by the simple miracle of a legislative act. It is more reasonable include that every vicious system contains and conceals within itself the seeds of its own destruction, and that under our torn of government, no private right is secure which operates to the detriment of public welfare. It is this active tendency everywhere manifest in moder affairs, that assures the future stability of our institutions. Con siderable interest was developed during the protracted lockout a Yirden. and an unfriendly press has persisted in misrepresentin e attitude of Governor Tanner in relation thereto. It wa rged that he had violated the law in refusing the compan right to employ men to work in their mines. This righ which is not disputed, never entered the problem at any time, was more a question of supremacy between a coal corporation an&lt; the government of the State of Illinois. Virden Coal Company petitioned the State Board o litration three different times to decide the contest at tha point, and as many times refused to accept or respect the decision On the last occasion they served notice on the Governor of a intention to import negroes from the South.

Part I is devoted to a study of the results of private an. 1 municipal ownership in the operation of gas works, electric light and power plants and water works, in the principal cities and towns of the State. The investigation on which the report is based embraces not only the details of construction and of phys - ical conditions which characterize the plants in the different gp tips, but also the financial status r.f each and the result ition as indicated by books of accounts and other n evidence of actual business ex|H?rience.

            <seg id="p631">595 E withstanding we had no law at the date of this investiga - n]&gt;elling the owners or operators of such plants to furnish an with information, we hail but few refusals, and the attained will l&gt;e disclosed upon an examination of the ■d report ■irt II relates to the experience of other States ami counties iblishing and maintaining free employment agencies for the and protection of the unemployed in large cities. Our bureau entered upon the private and municipal investiga - tion without preconceived opinions, with no theory of ownership, either to confirm or controvert. The inquiry possibly assumed a wider form than that so far undertaken by any individual State. The returns from the different plants are at least approximately correct, and the facts presented without prejudice. Commenting on some features of the report we had occasion to make the fol - lowing observations : It has been recognized that the difficulties of such an investi - gation are many and great; that it is probably impossible to over - come them altogether; that the details of construction and man - agement are complicated and diverse: and that the economic results of operation are often contingent upon terms not common to any considerable number of establishments. Yet these consid - erations have not deterred the federal office nor this bureau from making the investigation. In the absence of any official data on this subject, it is believed that the facts gathered by a carefully conducted inquiry will possess a material value even though they fail to answer conclusively many of the questions which naturally arise in relation to municipal monopolies. Upon this thi that even negative results are better than none, has the investiga - tion proceeded. By preliminary investigation it was discovered that there are in Illinois fifty-seven gas plants, all under private ownership: 236 electric light and power plants, t&lt;&gt;j of which are under private and thirty-nine under municipal ownership, and 1 65 water wrks plants, thirty-five of which are under private and 130 under mu - nicipal ownership: in brief, that 458 plants of all kinds are estab - lished in 243 cities and towns of the State: that the electric light </seg>
            <seg id="p632">596 I are tar more numerous than either of the others; that water are next in number, and that there are only one-fourth as pas works as electric light plants. It is further observed he gas works are all private enterprises, that one-sixth of ectric light plants, and three- fourths of the water work? are municipal. I The cities and towns in which these establishments are f distributed throughout the State with a uniformity very near - sponding with the distribution of the larger towns. By oping these according to the population given to each by t 1 c ■ral census of iN&lt;jo, it ap|&gt;ears that 130 towns in which public k- of one kind or another are maintained, have less than 2.000 ibitants: that 205 have less than 5.000: sixteen have ; ■1 to 10.000: fifteen, from 10.000 to 20.000. and seven hav 20.000 inhabitants. With a field of this nature presented for inquiry, the agents ct the bureau were sent to every quarter of the State to make per - and specific investigation of the physical condition and the Ics of every plant It was very soon developed that the exer - -■ mie discrimination as to the plants which should he luled was necessary to the liest results, and a number "f minor establishments, such, for instance, as the lighting plants rated a- collateral to manufacturing and mining enterpr and other plants whose books were impossible of analysis, an'! e which had less than a full year's ex]&gt;erience. were omitted from consideration.

The returns were obtained from 102 cities and towns, well distributed throughout the State. Denned as to population, twenty-eight of them have less than 2.000 inhabitants: forty-nine have less than 3.000 inhabitants, and sixty-nine, less than 5,000 inhabitants. Of the remainder, twelve have from 5,000 to 10,000: fourteen, from 10.000 to 20,000. and seven, over 20.000 inhabitants. There are twenty-one cities in this State which had a population in 1890 of over to.ooo: this report contains stat' from all of them, and from many of them statistics relatr the three kinds of plants. In all there are 194 plants embraced in the tables, of which ninety-six are municipal and ninety-eight private concerns This e&lt;|iial division does not, however, obtain in the several cl;; - owing to the fact that there are no municipal gas works in the State, and the further fact that by far the greater number of water works are owned by municipalities, while the larger num - ber of electric light plants are owned by private corporations. \s a consequence the relative numbers of the tw'o latter classes are in reversed proportions, giving us sixty-nine municipal water plants as against thirteen private plants, and twenty-seven munic - ipal electric light plants as against sixty private plants. There has been no selection of establishments with a view to •ing returns of any given character. On the other hand, the purpose and instruction has l&gt;een to procure the experience of al! available establishments, whether public or private, or larg small, or well or ill-managed, or prosperous or unsuccessful. The result is that the various groups tabulated are in effect represc rive of the several kinds of public works as they now exist in the State. Some show gains, some losses, and others an even lal - ance sheet as a result of the last year's operation; the widest dif - ferences are shown in magnitude and cost of plant, in operating conditions and expenses and in prices to consumers. Indeed, the ramifications of diversity are so complex as to eml&gt;arrass com - parison at every jxiint. and no conclusions can l&gt;e safely drawn </seg>

At the suggestion of the bureau, the Governor, in his message to the General Assem - bly, called attention to the need of such legislation and urged its enactment, and to his friendly, active interest is due the credit of their passage. The revised mining law. covering about thirty printed pages, was prepared by the bureau, and passed b &gt;tl" branches of the General Assembly without a single negative vote. In its preparation we had occasion to review the mining laws of the different States of this country and Eun&gt;]»e.

Our factory inspection law is inadequate and unsatisfactory. It requires the authorities of all cities and towns of over 5.000 inhabitants t' &gt; appoint a factory inspector and to pay for his serv - said inspector to work under the supervision of the Lal&gt;or missioner and to make two inspections each year of all fac - tories and workshops employing ten or more persons. But DO penalty is provided for failure to ap|)oint. or to inspect and report, after appointment. However, through diligent effort we have ed the observance of the law by nearly all cities t &gt; which it applies, with passably good results and bj this means have pre - ted many casualties and corrected existing abuses.

Secretary: Indiana Bureau, the Hon. John B. Conner. Chief. Indiana. — Mr. Conner: Mr. President, the bulletins pub - lished by the Indiana Bureau of Statistics during 1897 and 1898 and the biennial re]x&gt;rt of the latter year giving the wide range of public taxation and ex]&gt;enditures by townships and counties per capita so intensified agitation for reform in local government lead the legislature of 1S99 to enact most radical cha and unique systems of local administration, unique because the forms are unlike those of any other State. Prior to this new der of things the trustee of each township was the sole arbiter in the matters of tax levies, estimates and ex|&gt;enditures. and prac - tically the auditor of his own accounts. Statistics by townships showing a very wide range per capita of taxation and ex&lt;)endi - ture culminated in such demands upon the legislature as- 1 1 cause the enactment of a law providing for a township advisory bt whose duty it is to fix rates of local taxation, and ]wss upon all estimates and expenditures authorized by townships and to audit all accounts of township trustees. The reform by special enact - ment extends now also to county administration, the new law pro - viding for county councils and limiting the power of county c &gt;m - missioners. which body formerly had supreme authority in tax levies, countv expenditures, and the auditing of their own ac- </seg>
            <seg id="p638">602 counts. The county council is now supreme in county adminis - tration, as the advisory boards are in township management, as already stated. 1 refer to these thing's in illustration of the influ - ence of statistical work on home government, focalizing as it does public thought on local administration, showing the inequalities of had systems, and resulting in important reforms. 1 he bureau will this year and next collect such economic facts under the operation of these new laws as will doubtless show in comparison the wisdom of the new legislation, as it is already ap]&gt;arent that more equitable tax levies and local expenditures are to result \n better county and township administration. EDther work in hand is that of comparing expenditures, in - edness. rates of interest, etc.. in cities and corporated t le State, and showing their public improvements on account hese expenditures, the purpose of such facts being to enable s and towns to compare conditions one with another of about population and similar public improvements. Bhe legislature of this year greatly strengthened the bureau efforts to obtain statistical facts respecting social, civil and nal matters, and under the new law much attention will be to secure statistics of crime against the person, against property and against society. Under suitable penalty, officers and Eis having knowledge and possession of facts relating to all of crime are required to answer questions and make report r ins furnished by the bureau. Life insurance in the State is another new feature of work. coming within the purview of the new statute on civil statistics, and. the purpose is to obtain facts about its volume, amount in . value of life insurance paid up, surrender value of all forms of such insurance, the amount of interest or other forms of income and annuities annually accruing to policy holders in the State.

These facts, of course, are chiefly those of record in the courts to which I have alluded. We have the reo from all those sources, and of course the bureau gains hut little information outside of that in res]&gt;ect to crime.

Now public officers and other persons hav - ing knowledge of these things are required to make these reports:. K-retarv : Xew York Bureau, the Hon. John McMackin. ler. \i:w York. — Mr. McMackin: Mr. President, in the work e Xew York Bureau of Lalx&gt;r Statistics this year investiga - are l&gt;eing pursued in three directions. The first is a Initiation of work l&gt;egun two years ago in the sha]&gt;e of quarterly ts from 1a1.or organizations as to their memliership and the int of employment and earnings of their members. As 1899 makes the third vear that such re]x&gt;rts have lieen collected, with each quarter of the present year comparison may now be made with the corresponding quarter for tw 1 years back. The latest returns collected, those i~&lt;&gt;r the quarter ending March 31. li sented 1.156 organizations with a total membership of 173. - whicli is in the neighborhood of 10 ]&gt;er cent, of the total numl&gt;er of working ]H?o]&gt;le in the State. These reports from ' nizations are secured partly by mail, perhaps one-fifth of all l)eing so obtained. The great majority of them, however, are ob - tained by agents of he bureau in personal calls upon union offi - cials. This first line of investigation thus gives us materials di- </seg>
            <seg id="p641">605 The second field of inquiry above mentioned consists of re - ports from employers. Here again the bureau is continuing a line of investigation previously begun. In 1896 reports were tained from employers in all lines of trade, covering the five years ending on June I, 1891 to [895, inclusive. This year similar re - ports are being collected for the year? 1896 to 1 899, As the same -twins concerning rates of wages, hours of work per week and aggregate wages paid to employees have l&gt;een asked in the present schedules as in 1 896, and as a very large proportion of the firms reporting in 1896 are on the 1899 list, we shall have material - comparison on those points for a period of nine years.

As to the extent of the present investigation, sched - ules have l&gt;een sent to over 13.000 firms covering all branch industry, bokeshops, clothing, quarries, contractors, railr I steam and street) as well as manufacturers. In 1N96 a little over 4.000 firms were covered, from a little over 90 per cent of whom returns were obtained. In connection with the returns from both employers and working ]&gt;eople a new subject in the work of the Xew York Bu - reau has been taken up; 1. c. industrial accidents, and this is the third line of inquiry above referred to. To all labor organiza - tions and manufacturers schedules have been sent whereon to re - cord all accidents l&gt;efalling any of their members or empl yets during the three months. April. May and June of this y These schedules call for the nature and cause of accidents, the extent of disabilities and loss of working time resulting gether with the number of dependents and source of support of e injured. These ]x&gt;ints. supplemented by certain other ques - - as to the numbers engaged in each trade, and the numhi days of operation during the period in question, should give us materials for some valuable results on the questions of trade risk. In this same connection questions are asked as to the extent lu which unions and employers insure their members. </seg>
            <seg id="p642">606 to the subject matters of the bureau's work this year. It remains to notice an important new departure in the presentation of the results of our work to the public. I refer t) a quarterly bulletin for which an appropriation was secured : ist legislature, at the suggestion of Governor Roosevelt, and the tir&gt;t number of which was issued a few weeks since. As I be - lieve this bulletin has come t'&gt; the notice of all of you, a brief mention of its purpose and scope will suffice here. The quarterly publication of this bulletin makes possible two very desirable things : First, and chiefly, perhaps, the general results of what - ever investigations the bureau may undertake can be give:i promptly to the public, without waiting for the annual re|K&gt;rt at the end of the year — which, however, still remains for the de - tailed and complete presentations in more permanent form. Thus, in &lt;&gt;ur first bulletin we could give the summaries of the returns from lal&gt;or organizations for the first quarter of this year just as soon as they were received and compiled. In that number, we published the labor laws enacted by the last legislature within a very few weeks of the close of the session. In the second place, the bulletin is a most convenient vehicle for the presentation in enient form of a number of matters of interest to the indus - trial world, which are scarcely appropriate for an annual statisti - cal rqwrt. Thus, in our first bulletin we presented summaries jf court decisions opon lalxir questions, many of which are of inter - est and importance to working people and others. Other similar subjects are collective agreements between employers and em - ees, a concise review of the grain shovelers strike at Buffalo. : labor notes and so on. Finally, such a publication, as pointed out, I notice, by the president of this association at the last annual convention, serves to present our work in more popu - lar form. The expert may lie perfectly willing to select the ma - terials he wants from out the mass of a detailed annual report, but to the laymen, who are much in the majority, concise lesults, plainly stated, and contemporary affairs are of more interest. *nd far more attractive. And everything which increases the circula • &gt;f the results of oar work, is certainly useful. Now. the ts I have suc"£rested concerninc the bulletin are sreneral in </seg>

But I want to add the very encouraging reception given to our first issue and the favorable criticism which it has met. make it plain that those points are not merely tin hut real matters of fact. Bin conclusion of my repirt as to the current work of the New rk Bureau, I should not omit to mention the Free Employment reau in New York City which continues its work as usual. Elr.

The manufacturers' s are not returnable until the 15th of July. Secretary : Michigan Bureau, the Hon. Joseph L. Cox. Com ■ner. Michigan. — Mr. Cox: Mr. President. I will l&gt;e brief m re - porting the work of our bureau for the past year. We belie, that we have just cause to feel proud of what has been acconf plished by the bureau, both in securing statistical information an in the enforcement of the State factory inspection laws. Throng « the liberalitv of the last session of the legislature the departme • receives an annual appropriation of $15,000 per year for fact" inspection and $8,000 ]&gt;er year for the gathering of lalx&gt;r m tics and expenses of the bureau. In addition to this the S pays the chief and his deputy's salary from the general fund - 10 in the first instance and $1,500 in the second. The gener fund also provides for the printing of 5.000 annual reports at- ' all ether excuses of printing and stationery, which in total gives us about $35,000 per year to prosecute the work 01' bureau. A new mine ius])ection law was created with an animal appropriation of $1,500 per year, which was also placed un&lt;ter the supervision of the commissioner of labor, for enforcement. </seg>
            <seg id="p644">608 KKI-OKT OF THE BlKKAl &lt; &gt;K I.AI1OK. During the last session of the legislature some seven different bills, affecting the interest of labor and the gathering of statistics were enacted into laws. This year we are making an extraordinary effort to determine the average wages of all classes of employees of the State and to determine the condition of mercantile, mining and manufactur - ing interests as compared with past years. From a recent resume of the reports gathered by special canvassers and correspondence, a very prosperous condition will be shown including a decisive in - crease in the wages of many. The industrial condition and outlook for Michigan is the best that it has l&gt;een for many years, while the number of factories enrolled have increased to the extent of several hundred. New ci&gt;al. iron and copper mines have 1&gt;een opened up and put into Operation, while eight new beet sugar factories have been erected within the jxist year. A large numl&gt;er of most excellent beds of marl and clav lxinks have been discovered and tested, and several plants for the manufacture of cement are now l&gt;eing erected and will soon l&gt;e in operation. The department has 1)een most kindly treated and encouraged by the manufacturers, press and trades unions of the State, while y. the mechanics and laixirers even-where have given us a helping hand in the gathering of statistics this year.

E&gt; has proved to be of great value, as it points out the kind erty that escapes taxation most easily. The story is full ling details. In addition to the taxation story on probated estates, a com - parison is shown between the assessable value and assessed valua - tion of the manufacturing and industrial concerns of the State. Of the whole number of concerns considered, it is found that they pay taxes on but 11.07 P^ cent - °f their assessable value. We propose to keep hammering away at this subject until some of the iniquities of our tax system shall be wiped off the statute book and out of existence. Wage-earners : The usual investigation is made into the con - ditions surrounding the wage-earners of our State, paying special attention to the earnings, cost of living and savings, making com - parison of these items as between owners of homes and rent - payers of those who work at like occupations and under like con - ditions. Some interesting facts are developed. For instance, it is found that the cost of living of the home owners is 73.1 per cent, of their earnings, while the cost of living of the rent-payers is 87.9 per cent, of their earnings. The home owners save 29.9 per cent, of their earnings, while the rent-payers save but 23.3 per cent, of their earnings and 66.1 per cent, of the home own - ers report a saving, while but 31.2 per cent, of the rent-payers re - port savings. The rent payers expend an average of 15 per cent, of their earnings for rent. m </seg>

Studies are of the profit and loss in their operation, their taxes, wages and many other details. Statistics of State Institutions: An interesting chapter tells 1 4 the number, value and cost of maintenance of our State insti - tutions in a manner that shows to every tax-payer at a glance the story of the State's money and what Incomes of it. Among other things it is shown that we have seventeen State institutions wlv «c total value is $9,580,057.00 inclusive of the State capitol building which has cost up to date $2.605,400.00.. These institutions require an annual appropriation of $1,063. - 657 for maintenance. The total assessable property in the State ; 25.889, 747 — for taxation purposes — and this on agreed basis nt about 33.1 per cent, or an actual basis of from 10 to 15 per cent, of the real value of the property. The levy made by the legislature for 1900 is 5.25 mills. Eight of our State institution? are under control of one body — State Hoard of Charities — wh" handle 29.4 per cent, of our State taxes. These and other facts of interest to every tax-payer in the State are brought out and disaussed. Factory inspection : The efforts of our department this year in the line of factory inspection have been largely turned toward having incorporated into our new law provisions requiring an'! •ming the same. The old law governing this department sim - ply made it the duty of the commissioner to "visit and inspect factories, workshops, mines, etc.." without prescribing any of hi&gt; duties or defining and feature of his work. He had no power to compel compliance with his recommendations, in fact had no au - thority to make recommendations, so the energies of the depart - ment were turned toward securing a letter factory inspection law. and in this we were successful. We now have an up-to-date fac - tory inspection law, with the labor commissioner authorized to act as factory inspector and better work can be promised in the </seg>
            <seg id="p647">611 Sociology : Under this head we have grouped a number of articles from able writers discussing the subjects, "How can the labor bureaus best aid in determining the true relation between labor and capital, and what investigations would best aid in secur - ing this result?" and "The relation of the labor bureaus to the labor movement." The articles, we believe, are well worth consid - eration by all economic students. ET legislation and decisions : Presented under this caption all the laws affecting the interests of labor passed at the of the legislature of 1898-99, as well as many decisions s throughout the country in which labor laws have been State Society of Labor and Indjustry : Without doubt th_ - greatest work of our bureau was the effort which secured the re - peal of the old law. under which the bureau was operated and in its stead secured the enactment of an up-to-date law carrying with it a provision increasing the annual appropriation for this bureau one hundred and twenty-three per cent, also, absolutely divorcing the department from politics and this in the face of a Govern' c'i message recommending the abolishment of the bureau seconded by a score of politicians who thought we were doing too much good in the world. Its best feature, perhaps, is the creation of the State Society of Labor and Industry, a body which is composed of delegates elected by the various labor organizations of ths State, who meet annually, and among other things, elect a com - missioner and assistant commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industry. These officers are sworn in by the Secretary of State and perform the usual duties in the collection of statistics and factory inspection, as well as being authorized to enforce all labor laws of the State. The new law authorizes the printing of not less than three thousand nor more than ten thousand annual re - ports. Six thousand will be printed this year for free distribu - tion. The reports shall contain not more than six hundred pages. The appropriation for the biennial period of 1900 and 1901 is $6,520 per annum, itemized as follow; ; </seg>

That constitutes the manner in which the society is formed. Having been once elected, the delegates are members of the so - ciety for one year and attend annual or special meetings that may be held. Annual meetings are held, and at such meetings it would be proper, and in accordance with the purposes of the law, for </seg>

Ew in addition to the formation of the society, as has been among 1 other features is the requirement of investigation of , of labor difficulties. It is also made the duty of the com - missioner of the bureau to cause to be enforced all laws regulating the employment of children, minors and women, and all laws for the protection of life and health on railroads and in other places, and all laws enacted for the protection of the working da ni &gt;w in force or that may be enacted. You have all had, perhaps, some difficulty with this feature of police power coming in conflict with the collection of statistics. While there may be some apprehension on that score, so far we have had no conflict in our State. I have endeavored to keep the two propositions separate as far as possible. Our societies which form this State society give it their hearty co-operation and en - dorsement. We have some 200 organizations in the State and they have turned out liberally and taken an active part in the work. We have every reason to believe that there will be no fur - ther difficulty, or at least, no more difficulty in operating the bureau under this law than there would be under the old one. But I believe we have this advantage — that there will be a wanner feeling and a closer co-operation between the laboring people for whom labor bureaus are created, and this bureau for the rea&gt;&gt; m that they will have a voice in the selection of the commissioner, that his work is perhaps closer to them, and with careful purpo&gt;e on his part it seems to me that any conflict of other interests can be avoided. Our work so far has been very satisfactory and as yet I am not persuaded but it will be as good as any other law in carrying out this work. Secretary: North Carolina Bureau, the Hon. W. E.

Last month we commenced the work of getting up a re - port for this year, a change in the administration having resulted in new officials in the bureau. I might report, however, the change in the law in reference to the bureau, enacted by our last legisla - ture, providing that hereafter the labor commissioner shall be elected by vote of the people, going on the State ticket, for a term of four years. Another change made was the placing of all the State printing and approval of all the bills of the State print - ers in the hands of the bureau, and chaning the name to the "Bu - reau of Labor and Printing" in the place of Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our work is not as extensive, of course, as that of the bureaus of other States, our interests being largely agricultural; but we are beginning to manufacture to some extent. We have now in North Carolina something like 200 cotton factories and » large number of tobacco factories. However, having been out of the work for two years, I am not in position now to give any facts in reference to the statistics of labor in the State and will therefore ask to make a written report.

Maine. — Mr. Matthews: Mr. President and Gentlemen: My report on the current work of our bureau will necessarily be brief, from the fact that our report is issued at the close of each calenda; year, and has not yet been entirely formulated. At the present time we are making investigations of the manufactures on the same lines as last year. Investigations are also in progress, through special agents, of the lumber industry, and of the pulp and paper industries of the State. The forestry of Maine is one of its most valuable inheritances. We have, in round numbers. 13.500.000 acres of timber land. The primeval woods of Main-, accordingly, will cover an extent seven times larger than that of the famous Black Forests of Germany, at its largest expanse in modern times.

The various branches of industry growing out of the lumber business of the State, fur - nish employment to at least 30.000 men. With the limited means at my disposal, the investigation of this immense interest can be only tentative, but. it is hoped that many valuable facts may be &lt; 'btained. The growth and development of the pulp and paper business during the past few years, has been phenomenal. A great number of new plants have been erected, and the expenditures made involve many millions of dollars. In 1895 about $13,000. - 000 were invested in palp and paper manufacturing in Maine, and employment given directly to upward of 5.000 men in these twin industries. Indirectly, a much larger number is kept busy, when one considers the cutting of the trees in the forest, the driving of the logs down the rivers to the pulp mills, and the various pto - es undergone. The l&gt;est wood for pulp is spruce, and, while northern Maine abounds with this article, the question naturally arises, will the supply long hold out to meet the rapidly growing demands made upon it? Mills are constantly being erected, and it is expected that our investigations will show an immense in - crease in the pulp and paper business since our last investigation in 1895. These investigations constitute the more important cur - rent work of our bureau. I am happy to be able to state that the relations between capital and labor are generally amicable, and that labor troubles have thus far, during the present year, been limited to two or three places in the State, and have been of short duration. Labor is generally employed at fair wages, and the outlook for general business is very favorable. Maine's immense resources are coming to be known and appreciated, and it is not a too optimistic view which we take, when we predict a bright fu - ture for our glorious State. Allow me here, gentlemen, to ex - press my appreciation of the honor done us by your brief visit to Maine, and my regret that you are not able to spend more time within our borders, as I am convinced, from the favorable opin - ions you have already expressed, that a fuller observation of our resources of sea and shore, of mountains, woods, lakes, and rivers, would impress you with the fact that Maine is a good State to live in as well as to be born in. </seg>

How - have prepared an outline of current work of the Minnesota "For the current year the Minnesota Bureau of Labor is chiefly engaged in the work of factory inspection. The Bureau is also giving considerable attention to the labor field, believing it to l&gt;e the primary end of the bureau's creation. Besides the work of inspecting labor employment establishments the bureau is seek - ing to obtain information on subjects having a direct bearing on the social, educational and financial interests of our working \ie&lt; &gt;ple. For instance, the amount of wages paid per month, per week and ]»er day to each class of workers, and also average earn - ings for those paid by the piece and the numljer in each class. This work, if kept up. will furnish a valuable comparison of the rate of earnings from year to year. Another subject is technical education. How many employees possess this valuable qualifica - tion in the various trades and occupations. ■low many employees own their homes, and how many of homes are encumbered are subjects under investigation. "As directed by the first legislature, the bureau is making an effort to determine the amount of Sunday labor performed by es - tablishments employing labor throughout the State. The results of investigations along this line show that out of 2.295 establish - ments thus far inspected 180. or about 8 per cent, perform a portion of their work on Sunday. The chief industries in which Sunday work is found areas follows: Machine shops, bakeries, breweries, express and storage companies, printing establish - ments, gas works, light, heat and power plants and switch yards. The amount of work done in machine shops on Sunday is rela - tively small, consisting only of urgent repairs. In bakeries the amount of work varies from three to five hours, and in connection with these establishments we must consider the fact that baker* </seg>
            <seg id="p653">617 w&lt; irk Sunday night instead of Saturday night, when bakeries, as a rule, are closed. "Express and storage companies generally run one or two wagons the entire day. The other industries mentioned perform a small portion of their work on Sunday, the time varying from three to six hours, with the exception of the light, heat and power plants, the employees of these industries working for the most part the entire day. Sunday work in switch yards is compara - tively small, consisting of that performed by one or two em - ployees to attend to switch lamps. "From this it will be seen that the percentage of labor per - formed on Sunday is relatively small, the highest percentage be - ing found in the light, heat and power plants, where Sunday work is 14 per cent, of the entire work performed during the week. In bakeries, machine shops, express companies, etc., Sunday work amounts to from 3 to 6 per cent, of the week's work. "Other ground being covered is the number of minors at work between the ages of 14 and 16 years, the number under 14 years, the occupation of each and their hours of labor. The bureau has already taken up an investigation of the mines and mining inter - 1 &gt;f the State. This work is practically completed. The report of this industry will show many new facts and figures, and the whole subject will be treated in detail. The production of iron ore in Minnesota is a matter of great importance to the people of the State at large, but particularly to our working people, as the development of the mines open to them new avenues of employ - ment. The production of stone and its importance as one of the State's industries will likewise be taken up. The lumber busine?-. which is one of the principal industries of the State, will also be covered, beginning with the timber standing in the forests to the lumber piled in the yards ready for shipment. Eis is the first regular attempt made in the State to obtain tion upon these two important industries. A considerable the work in both investigations has already been done.

While the figures tabulated in some instances show an ab - solute loss to the producer, it is in no sense a reflection upon the industry of the farmer or an argument against Virginia. It does show, however, that the figures given in some cases are largely guess work, and in several instances to be perfectly absurd. I am confident, however, that when the farmers realize the importance nf the statistics, and being called upon for information they wll' in future give more attention to this matter and furnish the de - partment with better and more accurate returns. The next important industry is that of manufactures, of which as complete a report is given as it was possible to obtain by the correspondence method. Blanks were sent to 1.182 open of manufacturing plants; 690 were returned. Of these 394 we^e tabulated, and the remaining 296 were found to be insufficient foi use. either in consequence of the meagre data contained therei.r. or the fact that certain of the establishments were not in active operation during the period covered by the interrogatories. Eie investigation embraces a comparative statement of the [896 and 1897 regarding the value of manufactured goods, tal value of stock of material used, total value of supplies total number of days in operation, total amount paid in . the capital involved, and the average daily wages and of labor per day in forty of the principal manufacturing ries of the State. The department has endeavored to ascertain through blanks, the true condition of the wage-earners connected with the princi - pal railways, street car lines, and mines of the State. A chap - ter has been devoted to organized labor in the State relative to the form, scope and purpose of each particular trade having a distinct organization, hours of labor which prevail in different trades, considered together with a statement concerning the rate of wages paid, and the benefits derived from membership in trade unions and kindred organizations. The last and one of the principal features of the report is a digest of the labor laws of the State. Virginia's Bureau has be^n appropriately called the "Baby Bureau." It is not only infantile from the fact that it is the latest creation in the chain of bureaus </seg>

Eisconsin. — Mr. Erickson: Mr. President, the last report : Bureau of Wisconsin was due last fall and as far as the u is concerned was completed in time. Its publication, hi m - was delayed until last winter owing to the rush of work in •inter's department. I lie report is divided into three parts. Part I includes an in - ■ation of the cost of growing corn and grain generally in &gt;nsin and the relation of this cost to the prices of the pro- Part II relates to factory inspection and shows the work and investigfiations carried on through the factory inspec- Part III relates to our manufacturing interests and includes is from industrial establishments for the years 1896-97. Of late years much has been said about the condition upon the American farm. While what has been said has not been entirely one-sided, the purpose of the greater part of it seems to have been to point out, that the economic condition of the farmer is far from what it ought to be, in fact, worse than that of any other class. In most cases this conclusion seems to have been drawn from the low or falling prices of grain alone. Prices of late years hav . usually l&gt;een compared with prices a few years back and the dif - ference, or fall, used as a proof, not only to show the existence of an agricultural depression, but also, as a measure, of the extent of this depression. It need hardly be said that the course of prices alone of a o &gt;nv modity is not always a safe indication of the conditions of the in - dustry by which this commodity is produced. In the first place the cost of production to the producer may have changed. There is, perhaps, no industry which has derived greater benefits from science and invention than agriculture. Chemistry has given us a better understanding of the soil and together with improved </seg>

That the reduced cost to the producers from these sources should affect prices is only nat - ural. It is also responsible for the greater part of the fall in the normal price during the past decade. Sen again agriculture is one of those industries in which a t of goods are produced. The farmers are as quick to see asp new opportunities as any other class. Except in places ive grain raising has given away to dairying, cattle raising, , fruit, or truck farming. This is the case in Wsconsin and ange has proved beneficial from every point of view. In most of the discussions of the agricultural problem the reduced cost and the substitution of products seems to have bee'i regarded as of minor importance. And it is partly because of this and partly because little along this line has. as yet. been published, that this inquiry into the expenses of growing certain crops was Among the crops included are wheat, oats, rye, barley and corn. Without going into details as to the results obtained, a few facts, relating to the expense of growing wheat and corn in Wis - consin, will \te given. The returns from 410 of the most success - ful and prosperous farmers in the State showed, that the annual investment, that is. the expense of labor, seed, taxes, depreciation of land, machinery and horses used, feed and incidental outlays amounted to $6.12 per acre for one crop of wheat and $7.91 per acre for one crop of corn. To the average yield the past six years this is equivalent to about 35 cents per bushel for wheat and l£ cents per bushel for corn. If to this is added interest at 6 per cent, on the value per acre of the machinery and horses used, the annual investment and the value of the land, which foot up to $3.33 per acre for wheat and $3.45 for corn, the expenses for wheat would \k increased from $6.12 to $9.45 per acre, or from 35 to 54 cents per bushel, and for corn from $7.91 to $11.36 per acre, or from 16 to 27 cents per bushel. Eiring the six-year period the average price per bushel for crops in the local market or elevators was 61 cents per for these crops in the local market or elevators was 61 </seg>

Pushel for wheat, and 34 cents per bushel for corn. is increased, in each case, by the value of the by - : the amount placed upon them by the farmers them - value per bushel is raised to 68 cents for wheat and r corn. The cost and value, respectively, was thus 54 and 68 cents per bushel in the case of wheat, and 27 and 40 cents per bushel in the case of corn. This is equivalent to a surplus of profit of 14 cents per bushel in the former and 13 cents per bushel in the latter case. As said above, these are results of 410 selected re - turns. But as the yield in these cases was considerably larger than the average yield for the State it also follows that the sur - pluses here shown are higher than the average profit of these products. This is also shown by the final results as obtained from over 1.500 returns. These returns were picked out from the total num - ber received, which numbered 4.000. because they were found t&lt;. fairly represent all classes of farmers in the grain growing por - tions of the State, and show a smaller yield per acre, and hence, a higher cost and lower surplus per bushel, than that given above. The average profit or surplus as compared fn &gt;m the results of al! returns tabulated ranged from 5 to 12 per cent on the capital in - vested or used, varying with the crop. to the proportion of the various elements of expense, to the total expense, the following results were arrived at : The expense of labor was 22.28 per cent, of the total expense for wheat, and 44.45 per cent, of the total expense for corn; of seed. 7 per cent, for wheat, and only a fraction of one per cent, for corn; of depreciation of land, machinery, horses and incidental outlays, 27.63 per cent, for wheat and 22.95 I* 1 " cent - f° r corn; of interest on the value of machinery and horses used, and on the amount of the annual investment, 7.36 per cent for wheat and 7.05 per cent, for corn ; of interest on the value of land, or rent. 27.84 per cent, for wheat and 23.34 per cent, for corn. The pro - portions given here for wheat apply also, with but small varia - tions, to oats, rye, and barley raised on the same land and under the same conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p661">REPORT OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR. 625 This investigation was made on a basis sufficiently broad to cover the ground fully. The inquiries were carefully prepared and the returns edited in each case. The results at every stage were submitted to leading farmers and experts and their sugges - tions adopted, whenever possible. Every precaution was taken to avoid errors throughout the whole work; and we therefore feel, that the results are reliable and may be used with safety. As to the condition on the farm the conclusion is, that, during the pas', six years, or the period covered, the farmers have, on the average, done as well financially, in proportion to their investment as those ped in most other industries. A threat deal of interesting data was also collected by our fac - tory inspectors during the past two years. This data relates mostly to the condition of factories and workshops with reference to the factory laws. Owing largely to the fact that this bureau has not been equipped with enough inspectors, we have found it extremely difficult to keep children under the legal age out of the factories. Instead of decreasing, child labor seemed to becom-. very common. In order to get at the real condition in this re - spect, and thus to show the need of additional legislation, we de - termined early last year, to take as complete a census as possible of all children, 16 years of age and under, who were employed at factory work, in most of our manufacturing centers. This work was also planned and carried out on a broad scale. Each child found at work in the places visited, was examined by the inspec - as to age. wages paid, kind of work done, time employed \if present and previous employer, place of birth, school attendance, occupation of father, and home conditions in general. In the case of children who appeared younger than the age given, or too weak for their duties, the investigation was carried to their homes and to the schools they had attended, whenever necessary. This work was continued throughout last year and up to the first of April this year. During this time over 5.600 children were ex - amined and about 580 of these dismissed from work, mostly be - cause of being under the legal age. The conditions thus revealed were laid before the legislature last winter, and more than any - thing else caused the enactment of laws increasing the number of &lt;i </seg>

These are some of the more important results which were ob - tained from about one-half of the cases investigated. It is likelv. </seg>
            <seg id="p663">627 h&lt; &gt;\\ ever, that, when complete, the returns will show s changes in the above facts. ( )ur manufacturing statistics can. perhaps. l&gt;e l&gt;est explained by stating that they were intended to cover, for Wisconsin, the same ground as that, which the report of manufactures, by the Bureau of Massachusetts, covers for that State. Wisconsin is already among the larger manufacturing States and is rapdly growing in this respect. It was therefore thought that stati - of this kind, if continued from year to year, would lie of as much, if not greater, value to the State than any other work we could have carried out. For our last report we thus succeeded in obtaining data for 1896 and 1897 from about 1.500 identical establishments. This, however, involved more work than was expected and, in addition to our other duties, taxes our resources quite heavily. As to the condition of our manufacturing interests the results, among other things, show, that there was an increase in 1897 over the previous year in the amount of capital used of 7.87 per cent. : in the value of products 9.53 per cent.: in the average number of persons em - ployed 9.34 per cent. : and in the average wages paid 7.31 per cent. The returns were complete, carefully edited and prepared for the report. They also cover about 67 per cent, of the workers employed in our manufacturing industries and about 74 per cent, of the total annual output. We have, therefore, the best of rea - sons for believing that the results represent, as near as can be de - termined by this method, the actual condition for the State. As this is our first effort in this line we do not feel able from it to estimate, either what our growth has been since the census of 1890. or to fortell the approximate results of the next census. Judging from business conditions generally the increase in 1897 over 1896 is the largest increase in any one year since 1891-02 but will fall somewhat short of the increase which is likely to ap - pear in the returns of 1898 over those of 1897. In collecting the material for this part we found it more diffi - cult to obtain the information wanted from establishments man - aged by trusts or other combinations than from those under pri - vate management. Individuals or private firms, while they may </seg>
            <seg id="p664">628 dislike the trouble of filling out the schedules, and to disclose cer - tain facts concerning their business, usually appreciate our work and readily, or with a little pressure, supply all the facts wanted however, with those which are controlled by the trust. In our State, at least, the policy of the trust is to refuse any information whatever relating to capitalization and to their vol - ume of business, and to give the fewest facts |v&gt;ssible regarding other parts of the business. When we apply to the local man 1 agers we are usually told he has no authority to make such a re - port, and sometimes also that even if he had the authority he could not do so. l&gt;ecause the Ixioks are kept at the general offices which, as a rule, are located elsewhere. \Yhen we apply to the general offices there is either a flat refusal or a significant silence. If this policy is to be continued it is easy to see that other meas - ures than mere polite requests or ]&gt;ersuasion will soon have to be resorted to in order to obtain data; especially if the present ten - dencies towards combinations have come to stay. I fully l)elieve that this is a problem which requires serious consideration and which must be solved before long if work of this kind is to be of the greatest value. (; intimated already, our manufacturing statistics will be ued.. The data for last year is already in and under prep - n. Our inspectors are also gathering further data relating : condition of laixir in factories, etc. If time permits it. work is also likely to l&gt;e taken up later.

The following are the subjects comprised in the report: Part I — The Statistics of Manufactures. This subject con - tains returns from upwards of five hundred establishments, but as about one hundred and fifty of these were from firms that had not previously reported, the presentation is limited to showing: the conditions prevailing in them for the year 1897. No com - parisons with the reports of the previous years are made and none will be attempted until the work reaches such a stage of develop - ment as will include substantially even- establishment in the State engaged in productive industry: when that point is reached, and I take pleasure in saying that with the assistance of a- compulsive law on the subject which was enacted at the last session of our legislature, I believe it soon will be. this system of manufacturing statistics will become as beneficial to New Jersey as that on which it is modeled, is to the great manufacturing State of Massachu- Current graded wages with the number of hours employed per day in upwards of forty occupations is given. The cost of living in the various sections of the State is given in tables of prices for upwards of fifty articles of provisions; t county of the State is represented in these tables by returns several of the leading towns in each. Under railroad trans - ion in Xew Jersey is given a classified list of employees of earn railroads, who are employed in the State, their average or monthly wages and annual earnings and the number of :mployed during the year. I he city, town, and county indebtedness of the State at three Is ten years apart, counting backward from 1898, is given notes and summaries showing the changes that have taken at each period. A brief study of trades unionism in which a comparison is made of the daily wages, hours of laBor, number of days em - ployed during the year, and yearly earnings, between an equal </seg>
            <seg id="p666">630 number of union and non-union men engaged in the hatters, ci - garmakers. and glass trades, completes part I. Part II — Part II is taken up entirely with summary tables of the report of the National Bureau on the occupations and earnings of men. women, and children employed in identical establishments at two periods ten years apart: of course, only the data drawn from Xew Jersev establishments is used. I 'art III — Part III contains the lalx^r legislation of the year, lecisions of the highest courts of the States on matters relat - o the employment of lalxir or affecting the interests of wage - rrs in the State: an original article on the "Law of Master Servant" as laid down in Xew Jersey: a reprint of the latest :men's compensation acts of England and France, which com - s the rejxirt of the bureau of statistics. The report of the building and loan associations, which has been for nine years past issued as part of the bureau report, has been this year published as a separate volume under its own title. The work of the bureau for 1899 will be the presentation of the statistics of manufacturers: an extended study of the benefit trades unions: a history of the strikes and lockouts that have oc - curred in the State from 1896 to as late a date in the current year as it may be found practicable to carry it: a comparison of the prices charged tor household supplies in company stores with the prices charged lor the same articles in private merchant stores in the same localities : the cost of living in the various sections of the State for 1898. and comparisons with the prices of 1899. The statistics of steam railroad employment will be gone into with more particularity than in the presentation of the last year; there will also be a presentation showing the conditions attending street railroad employment with particular reference to the classi - fication of employees, the number of hours worked per day and the daily wages of each class. Eie labor legislation enacted at the 1899 session of the legis - and the adjudication of the courts of cases arising undet m of "Master and Servant" will as usual, be one of the feat - &gt;f the report. </seg>

I take much pleasure in saying that interest in the bureau and its work has increased very much during- the past year; the im - portance and value to a great manufacturing State of relible sta - tistics shewing from year to year the condition of its industries is very generally recognized: a very gratifying evidence of thi&gt; interest in. and sympathy with the work is the passage of an act by the legislature providing a penalty for neglect or refusal to answer such questii ms as may l&gt;e asked in the blanks of the bureau and also in increasing the annual appropriation $1,000. This legislation has caused a very great expansion of the work of the bureau: the statistics of manufactures will this year be based on reports from not less than fifteen hundred establishments while last year there were but five hundred and soon. I confidently hope, the report of every manufacturing establishment in the State, large enough to make them worthy of notice, will be found among these statistics. The salaries of the chief and secretary are fixed by law at respectively $2,500 and $1,500 per year. I he appropriation, which is independent of these salaries is at $5,000 j&gt;er year with an allowance of $250 for blanks and stationery. The printing of the annual re]x&gt;rt is also pro - for outside of the appropriation. Salaries of clerks em- J in the office, and of agents employed on the outside, post - nd expressage. and all other expenses incidental to carrying ; work of the bureau are paid out of the appropriation.
