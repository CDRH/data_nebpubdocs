            <seg id="p015">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE - By VICE-PRESIDENT REED: The next order of business win De to receive the remarks of our President upon this annual occasion. PRESIDENT'S ADDRKSS Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: I am reminded that I have just about completed two years of service as your President and must surrender the duties and responsi - bilities of that position to my successor in a very short time. I have the pleasure of knowing that it was during the two years I have served as President that the Fair attained its greatest attend - ance. The splendid record of 1929 was exceeded in 1930, despite a hot, dry summer and a period of depression. I think the increased attendance in 1930 is a remarkable tribute to the quality and popular - ity of the Fair with the people. Such a record could not have been made without the confidence of a great share of the people of the state. The members of the Board are rejoicing with the members of the ■1-H Clubs over the prospect of a new Club building to be erected this year. The plans have been drawn, the site selected, jftnd work will begin in plenty of time to have a completed building before the 1931 Fair starts. The new building will give a tremendous impetus to Club work and we may expect a large attendance of youth and a more generous interest in their work from this time forward. The prospect of a new building for the Club members draws attention to some other building needs. We need a new horse barn. We "cannot expect to interest exhibitors in our horse show with the quarters we now provide. The Coliseum should be completed. There are many profitable uses to which the structure could be put. But tho most important permanent improvement, in my judgment, is a water storage tank to supply a sufficient amount of water for the needs of the patrons of the Fair and provide an adequate fire protec - tion. I think we owe it as a duty to our guests to see that the last named improvement is made as early as possible. With the additional expense of upkeep and the duty of providing more and larger premiums, the Board cannot be expected to provide the new buildings and permanent improvements out of the earnings of the Fair. These are properly matters to be taken care of by legis - lative appropriations. Our own Legislature has been mindful of our needs but not so generous as the Legislatures of other states. We have a right to ask and expect these appropriations in the name of the great state we serve and the great cause of agriculture our State Fair so pre-eminently represents. In closing my work as a member of the Board and its President, I wish again to- express my sense of appreciation of the honor which you conferred on me two years ago. It has been my earnest endeavor to serve the State Board of Agriculture and through it the great agri- </seg>

Respectfully submitted, A. W. LAMB, President. By PRESIDENT LAMB (resuming the Chair): We will now hear the Annual Report of our Secretary: SECRETARY'S REPORT FOR 1930 Our 1930 State Fair kept up its annual attendance record, the total number passing through the gates in the eight days was 439,382 or 1,722 more than ever before. We attribute this increase to the Sunday attendance; on account of Rev. Billy Sunday, we had 7,794 more people on the grounds than in 1929 on that day. Our daily average, compared with 1929 was as follows:. 1929 1930 Loss Gain Friday 21,287 18,467 2,820 Saturday 41,954 40.319 1,635 _____ Sunday 29,622 37,416 7,794 Monday 114,473 105,689 8,784 Tuesday 57,856 62,669 4,813 Wednesday , 63,829 68,349 4^520 •Thursday 74,362 72,720 1,642 Friday ; 34,277 33,753 524 ■ • TOTAL 437,660 439,382 15,405 17,127 TOTAL GAIN — 1,722 Every county in the state with one exception was represented. Total number of Nebraska cars was 45,638 and total foreign cars 3,770. Grand total of all cars 49,408. In laying our plans for our 1931 Fair it is well for us to review the past before we visualize the future. We must meet conditions as they really are and form our budget so as not to cripple any de - partment to the extent that it will fail to function, but economy and service should be paramount in every activity of the Fair. Some times it is economy to spend money. Take advertising for instance. Ad - vertising is looked upon today as a convenience; it is estimated that woman makes or decides upon ninety-five per cent of the purchases made at retail stores, or those purchases that have to dp with the home, while still sitting at home in an easy chair in her own living room. Balloon tires, vacuum sweepers, radios, power washing ma - chines, iceless refrigerators, electric irons, permanent waves, etc were classed as luxuries at one time, but today they are necessities. They have been placed in the necessary scheme of things because the public . has been told about them in that light. No one ever heard of the rainy season In California until he goes there, but you do hear that California is the land of sunshine; they believe In advertising. Some- </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT dF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE one has likened the business man who does not advertise to the fellow who winks at his girl in the dark; he knows what he is doing but no one else does. Well directed advertising means a great deal to any growing institution. I am an optimist as far as the Nebraska State Fair is concerned. We have been getting the attendance and we are going to continue to get them regardless of conditions of weather and there will be no criticism from our patrons in paying fifty cents admission, but we should get about thirty cents from each man, woman and child that enters our main gate in grandstand and concession receipts. Our report will show that we had a larger attendance, but our grandstand receipts were $5,895.00 less than 1929 and our concession receipts were $1,302.00 less. While our main gate will show that our attend - ance was greater, our receipts were less. This doesn't sound reason - able, but it can be accounted for in this way: In 1929 we had 12,500 boys and girls in the state in the 4-H Club work; they are all pro - vided with a free pass into the Fair. In 1930 we had 14,500, or 2,000 more free passes for each day. This explanation will overcome what seems to be a discrepancy. While our report will show greater attend - ance, it will also show that they did not patronize the grandstand and concessions as in 1929, many bringing in their meals and drinking water instead of buying their lunches, lemonade and pop, making these trips as economical as possible. This no doubt will continue to be until we get over the depression that we are going through at the present time and agriculture gets back on a paying basis. Un - fortunately the Fair program must be framed early in the year before It is possible to know anything about crop conditions. This was true of the season of 1930. I am indebted to Mr. A. E. Anderson of the State and Federal Division of Agricultural Statistics for the following report giving the weather conditions by months: "Weather has a greater influence on crop production than any other single factor. There were more or less extended periods of dry weather and wet weather during 1930. There was also a period of abnormally high temperatures during July and August. One strik - ing feature of the year was the almost general tendency for all crops to improve toward harvest time. The conservation of moisture by proper tillage saved the Nebraska corn crop from ruin by the July drouth and the unusually high temperatures during July and August. For the country as a whole, the year 1930 will be numbered among those of severe drouths. Nebraska, while more fortunate than most of the states, suffered considerably from drouth also. The 111 effects of drouth were not as apparent because. Nebraska farmers had learned how to maintain maximum production under more or less semi-arid conditions and were able to conserve moisture which carried crops, over periods of drouth. As a result, all Nebraska crops are above the average. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Rainfall was quite heavy during the autumn of 1929. This was good insurance for wheat against winter-kill and the beneficial effects of the reserve subsoil moisture supply were carried into 1930 to tide crops over during periods of deficient moisture. General information on rainfall from month to month and the effect on crops follows. January Weather The weather was unusually cold. Fortunately for winter wheat there was ample moisture to prevent injury until snows came during the second and third weeks of the month. Temperatures were con - siderably below zero during much of the month. Snowfall was above normal. February Weather There was a most marked contrast between January and February weather. Temperatures averaged considerably above normal Pre - cipitation was about half of the normal amount. Winter wheat made some growth under the favorable weather and reserve moisture supply carried from previous months. Conditions were favorable for early farm operations. March Weather Rainfall was far below normal. This together with a few days of high winds and a period of low temperatures at the close of the month did some injury to winter wheat and the condition did not appear quite as favorable as previously. An unusual amount of spring farm work was done during the first three weeks of March since tem - peratures were high. However, seeding of oats was delayed due to the cold period at the close of the month, although some had been done previously. The early advance of fruit buds was checked. April Weather The shortage of rainfall during February and March continued until April 12. A week of rainy weather which was followed by precipitation at the close of the month brought the average for the ?? n *t f f fu b ° Ve n ° rmal - HIgh Wind8 for three d^ B Preceding April 12 did further injury to winter wheat and other small grain crops Marked improvement of all small grain crops was noted after the rain The surface soil was too dry for small grain crops to sprout evenly prior to the rain. By the close of the month, the season was further advanced than usual. May Weather Rainfall during May was far above normal. There was a de - ficiency of sunshine and the temperatures were below the average. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD. OF AGRICULTURE Rainy, cool weather retarded corn planting and made considerable replanting necessary. The moist conditions favored the development of the Hessian fly which was prevalent in the eastern third of the state. The close of May found corn planting greatly retarded, but with a great reserve soil moisture supply. June Weather In general, June weather was highly favorable to crops: Rain - fall was slightly below normal but no crops suffered from the lack of moisture. Temperatures were slightly below the average, which was highly favorable for all small grain crops. Most of the crops made marked growth and a decided improvement was shown. Corn did not make the usual progress as It was late and the cool, wet weather which favored small grain crops was unfavorable for corn. There had been considerable replanting, stands were below the average, and the general prospects not up to normal. Hay and pasture crops had done fine. July Weather July weather was about the most unfavorable for crops ever recorded, but it was very favorable for harvesting and threshing small grain crops. Temperatures were abnormally high throughout the month except for occasional days of slight relief. Rainfall was far below normal, about the fourth lowest on record. Rainfall was nearly normal in western Nebraska. The high temperatures and low rain - fall did not injure the corn as badly as expected due to the large reserve soil moisture supply. However, the heat blasted some of the tassels and upper leaves In eastern Nebraska. Pastures deteriorated In the eastern half of the state but were good in western' Nebraska. The third crop of alfalfa was injured and also the late potatoes in eastern Nebraska. August Weather The long severe drouth was broken about August 5, and the precipitation for the month averaged considerably above normal and except for a few areas was ample throughout the state. Tempera - tures averaged above normal but did no injury since the rains 'began. Pastures were soon revived and alfalfa made a splendid growth, the condition at the close of the month being about the best ever observed for that date. Corn was late due not only to late planting but retarded growth during July, while favorable weather during August kept it growing throughout the month, and the condition had improved greatly before September 1. Soil conditions were favorable for plowing for wheat after the rains,. ... .. ....'. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE September Weather September rainfall was 75% of normal and temperatures averaged above the average, two factors which hastened the maturity of the late corn crop. Rainfall was heavier In western Nebraska but corn was further advanced there. The light frost about September 25 in western Nebraska did no damage. Pastures greened up In fine shape and conditions were favorable for harvesting the last crop of alfalfa A fourth alfalfa crop was grown on 20% of the acreage this year and was one of the best on record. There was considerable sunshine and windy weather and this, together with the reduced rainfall and high temperatures, was most ideal for corn and most of the other crops. October Weather Rainfall was about two-thirds of the average and temperatures were below average, being higher In the early part of the month This was favorable for maturing corn before the first frost which came October 16. Rainfall was very heavyln western Nebraska and the low temperatures at the close of the month did some Injury to potatoes. The weather was favorable for farm work and for husking corn after the killing frost. November Weather The rainfall was above the average for the month, but the soli had become quite dry for wheat during the early part of the month until relieved by rains during the third week of the month This re - lieved the wheat in eastern Nebraska and temperatures were high enough for it to continue growth, and go into the winter under Ideal conditions. There was considerable snowfall In western Nebraska Most of the corn husking was finished before the close of the month. December Weather December weather was quite favorable for completing the corn husking and other farm -work. There was some Interruption from rainy weather. The soil is generally well supplied with moisture except in a few localities and wheat is going into the winter under satisfactory soil moisture conditions. General Weather and Crop Summary The outstanding features for the year were a large reserve sub - soil moisture supply to begin with, which was further Improved by very heavy rainfall during April and May. Low temperatures with Plenty of moisture resulted in splendid crops of small grain crops. The season was not favorable for corn but the crop withstood the </seg>

The total amount appropriated by the state to the State Board of Agriculture for the purpose of promoting agriculture is $30,300.00 which the following organizations, that are fixed by law, share: Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. Nebraska Home Economics Association. Nebraska State Horticultural Society. Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders' Association. Nebraska Potato Improvement Association. Nebraska State Poultry Association. We find through these very excellent heads that they are getting wonderful results and their reports and findings are made available to all persons through the publication of reports that are compiled and mailed to practically every agricultural college in the world, and financed by this Board. In addition the Board handles the funds of the Organized Agri - culture meeting held in Lincoln each year in January. The amount appropriated by the state for this activity is $3,000 for the biennium. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is almost impossible for all the people to attend the sessions of Organized Agriculture at Lincoln, on account of the distance, so we take Organized Agriculture to them and this activity is called Western Organized Agriculture. This year the session was held at Chadron. Hereafter we expect to hold the sessions at four different locations, two days at each place. The speakers will move from one section to another much like chautauqua talent. Thus instructors of ability will be available by reason of the number of dates that can be served in .a few days' time. We are sure we can reach many more people by this method than by holding the meeting at one location. The Department of Publicity is another activity of this Board. A; fund of $10,000 a year for advertising Nebraska was voted to the Board by the Legislature of 1929. The board created a Department of Publicity that supplies newspapers and magazines with accurate material about Nebraska, writes and publishes booklets and other printed matter about the state, and strives to teach the people of the state the extent and importance of the resources and development of Nebraska and its worth as a state of agriculture and industrial oppor - tunity. The Department supplies about 230 newspapers of the state with a weekly news service about Nebraska; issues a weekly radio news service about Nebraska that is used by seven Nebraska stations; the Director has written a number of magazine articles and appeared as speaker on a number of Nebraska programs.' Printed. matter pre - pared and issued by the Department includes 90,000 copies of a book of facts, entitled "Nebraska Nuggets;" 10,000 copies of a folder en - titled. "Know Nebraska;" 5,000 copies of a dairy booklet entitled "Cow All the Way Through;" 20,000 copies of a Nebraska map show - ing places of scenic and historic interest; and 5,000 copies of the Nebraska state flower for distribution in the schools. One feature of this Department was a large topographical map, picturing Nebraska's industries, soil and scenery, that was exhibited at the 1930 State Fair. The Department had two young men lecture for the entire week of the Fair on the resources of Nebraska to the immense crowd that visited this outstanding exhibit of the Fair. This exhibit was erected by Mr. J. A. Poteet of Dallas, Texas, an exper - ienced exhibit designer, winning first prize a few years ago in Chicago, against all countries, on one of his exhibits. The exhibit at the Ne - braska State Fair was erected at a cost of $5,000.00. Many cities through their Chamber of Commerce, the Omaha Stock Yards Com - pany, the Nebraska Farmer. State Park Board, and many individuals contributed to the expense of building. But as stated before, the State Fair isof course, the great accom - plishment of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. The patrons of the ..Fair are expecting something new each year and are entitled to it. If not, we will soon get in the rut and the whole trend of conversation will be, "The same old Fair, nothing new." When that </seg>
            <seg id="p023">REPORT- OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD^OF AGRICULTURE time comes you can figure that your Fair is slipping and it is all un - called for. New decorations, and different methods of exhibiting will change the entire aspect. I have often said that there is no set rule nor program for con - ducting Fairs. Each organization- must be able to visualize the future by the past and meet conditions as they appear. There are, however, fundamentals on which all Fairs should be built. Every Fair, State or County, should be built on a structure of confidence, integrity, education and progress and carry out the real meaning of the word Fair. Confidence is our greatest asset. No institution nor individual can long exist without the confidence of the people they are doing business with. It will . always be paramount in an era of intense competition. Hundreds of books have been written on salesmanship; thousands of business executives try continually to teach it to their men, but after all there remains one single factor which has been and always will be the great fundamental principle of selling and in the reach of all — that is confidence. Greater confidence in you, in what you say, in what you do, in the way you run your business will make regular and permanent customers. If you have the entire con - fidence they will overlook your many mistakes, but if you lack their confidence you will be criticised for many things you know nothing about. To gain this confidence of course your integrity must be above reproach. And Fairs are not much different than individuals. Many times we see business men practicing deception and dishonest methods of building up their business, tripping themselves by trying to deceive others. We see men worth millions of dollars filled with terror, trem - bling lest investigation may uncover things which will damn them the rest of their lives in the public eye. The trouble with too many men today is that they do not stand for anything outside their vocation. There is some flaw in them which takes the edge off their virtue. They may be fairly honest but you can not bank on them. The same will apply to Fairs, the Fair Association that thinks of their receipts only, can not permanently stand. Not only must we consider what is taken in at the gates, but what is taken out as well. It must mean something to the thousands that can not attend the Fair as well as those that can. Education is another corner to the Fair structure and one of the fundamentals of every Fair and a very important. one. Education can be developed to be the outstanding activity of any Fair. Thousands come to the Fair because they look upon it as an investment. It makes no difference what their vocation In life may be, they will get new ideas ' and they may be able to take short cuts in connection with their own business and take advantage of the other fellow's ex - perience. They realize that they get a fair return for the invest - ment of the trip. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Fair is a test of methods, as these can be known only by results. Merchants in our larger cities realize the importance of their display windows, many claiming these display windows must at least pay the rent of the building, so consequently their window decorator holds one of the important positions. We nnd exhibitors that make our Pairs and pay a substantial rental for space to exhibit in then fail completely, for their methods of displaying their exhibit would fail to attract attention. So if Fairs are to continue to be great educational institutions, they must teach the lessons of persistent effort along with new ideas and new methods they must keep in advance of the times and go hand in hand with the state they repre - sent. You cannot speak of one without advertising the other. Another important lesson that a Fair can teach is the value of persistent effort in striving toward a goal, and the boy or girl or an exhibitor at any age, who fails to win a prize and yet who has learned this lesson will be the winner in later contests. Failure after failure has been instrumental in the making of many an outstanding character The fellow who keeps everlastingly at It is the winner in the final analysis. It is not always the winner by any means that gets the most out of the competition at the Fair. The loser, if he is a student will receive benefit in short-cuts or new methods, new ideas new conceptions which are worth more to him than the premiums. ' It is the doing of a thing which counts and the prize won is only evidence that you have made a success. Progress, another corner of this structure, is the watchword of every growing institution and is the evidence of success or failure of all Fairs. We can not stand still. If so, we will soon go backward The slogan of every Fair should be and is, bigger and better not only in quantity but quality as well. I will now present the Nebraska State Fair as it appeared to be in all of its many activities. Horse and Pony Show It was the verdict of the superintendent of the horse show that the exhibit this year was unusually strong. There was keen com - petition in the draft horse classes and some line animals were shown. The ponies, housed in their own building, drew a large number of visitors and afforded one of the places of interest at the Fair ground for children and grown-ups. Horse Pulling Contest That horse pulling contests are interesting to farmers and those who work and drive horses was evidenced by the crowds who gathered to witness the horse pulling contests. The measuring device that is- </seg>
            <seg id="p025">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE used enables the owner of a team to accurately determine its pulling power, and some astonishing results have been noted. It is not always the big team that pulls the greatest load, but the well-balanced team coordinating its pulling power perfectly. Stock Yards Teams Attendants at the Fair never tire of seeing the splendid examples of horse flesh that are shown by the Chicago and Omaha Stock Yards companies. These great teams appeared in exhibition each afternoon in front of the grandstand and had a very Important part in the grand parade. Beef Cattle Beef cattle were short in number but the quality was better. The late arrival of a number of shipments delayed the opening of the complete exhibit, but visitors who came after Sunday saw the show ■ in its completeness. It is the general verdict of those who watch the cattle exhibit each year at the State Fair that there is a good increase in the quality of cattle in Nebraska. The managers ot the Fair have reason to feel that.it is through the Fair and the opportunity it gives for showing the good cattle of Nebraska that this splendid progress has been realized. Dairy Cattle That the dairy industry in Nebraska is rapidly expanding was forcibly shown by the dairy cattle division this year. There was a total of 327 individuals shown from the four principal dairy breeds. While some of the firsts went to outside individuals, local Holstein breeders received a large part of the winnings. An added attraction tliis year was the exhibit of county herds. Lancaster, Gage and Doug - las herds finished in the order named. The Jersey heifer calf class was the largest and best group of live stock ever shown in the Coliseum. The most attractive exhibit of the entire dairy show was the ten beautiful Ayrshire cows shown by the Ayrshire Breeders Association of Brandon, Vermont. This exhibit was placed in the form of a model barn. Cedar trees shipped fresh from Vermont made a hand - some setting for the barnyard scene. Nebraska has a right to be proud of her dairy show this year and an increase next year is sincerely hoped for. Swine The swine show was one of the very best in the history of the Fair as to quality. The numbers were a little short of the preceding </seg>
            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF 1 AGRICULTURE year but this deficiency was made up in quality. An additional feature of the show was the exhibit put on by the University of Nebraska which displayed several pens of pigs on various rations. This exhibit attracted a large attendance and showed the utility of wheat as a hog ration. Noticeable improvement was shown in Chester Whites an*' Hamp - shires. Apparently these breeds are gaining ground in Neoraska, while the Polands and Durocs still remain popular with breeder*. Superintendent J. S. Golder expressed himself as being very much pleased with the swine exhibition this year. Sheep and Goats The display of sheep did not come up to the expectations of the management but the interest in the exhibit of sheep seems to be growing. The sheep industry is rather new in Nebraska and is now coming to the stage where the rivalry of breeds will result in keen contests at stock shows. As last year, there was a good showing of milk goats and a stand in the pavilion dispensed goat milk, which seemed to be very popular with many people. The milk goats seem to be a growing species in Nebraska. Poultry Considering the fact that the Pair came on the heels of a hot, dry summer which was not conducive to finishing of exhibition poultry, the show was a good one. There were 1,250 birds on exhibit. The White Leghorns were first' in point of number, Buff Orping - tons were second and the Barred Rocks were third. So well cared for were the birds that there was only one. sick bird in the entire show. Some birds, according to the judges, were good enough to be seen in royal company at the Chicago show. Pigeon Show For the first time a pigeon show was held at the Fair with an exhibit of 300 birds. The display was good and indicated the in - creasing numbers of a branch of poultry that is growing into a com - mercial Industry - 9&gt; Rabbits and Fur Bearing Animals Rabbit raising in Nebraska for fur and food has developed very rapidly. Last year's display of rabbits at the Fair astonished visitors by its size. Three hundred rabbits, representing five different breeds, were on exhibit. The show this year was about on a par with last year. The rabbit growers will be soon demanding a better place of ! </seg>
            <seg id="p027">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE exhibition than the one they have been using, which was a makesnui arrangement at the north side of the Agricultural Hall. If the present interest continues, rabbits will be an important industry in this state from this time forward. Agriculture Agricultural Hall was rearranged for the 1930 show and the re - arrangement was approved by exhibitors and visitors. With its color - ful decorations the interior presented a delightful appearance. Twenty-one counties had displays which were unusually good, notwithstanding the fact that hot, dry summer weather had visited the state. In the east end of the hall was a most interesting exhibit by i the Game, Forestation and Parks Commission, showing a section of northwest Nebraska in miniature. This exhibit as well as the relief map of Nebraska located in the west end of the building, was most . popular with visitors at the Fair. The displays in Agriculture Hall showed all types of Nebraska , agricultural products in a most effective way. Horticulture The horticultural display in Agricultural Hall showed exhibits from a number of Nebraska commercial orchards. A large image representing Dr. Apple was a striking feature of the display. Con - sidering the drouth conditions this exhibit was of very fine quality. Fruit from all parts of the state were shown, the first prize for a collective display going to a Custer county farmer. The show In - cluded all varieties of apples that are common to Nebraska as well as grapes, plum's and peaches. 4-H Clubs The knowledge that a fine new building for the 4-H Clubs was in prospect for next year heightened interest in all the club activities. The 4-H building was full to the roof with all the sides bulging, and contained the finest display of the products of 4-H Club members the people of Nebraska ever saw. Interest, of course, centered in the baby beeves and the greatest sale that was ever held came on Tuesday. A total of 175 baby beeves - were offered in the annual sale. The grand champion brought $44 a hundred, the reserve champion brought $25 a hundred and the remain - ing animals averaged about $12 a hundred. The display of pigs and dairy calves was unusually good. There was keen competition in the demonstration work shown on the second floor of the building. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the evening the 4-H Club members were guests of the Fair management at the grandstand. They formed a parade which aston - ished the folks in the grandstand by its length and number. Never before, outside a national gathering, had so many 4-H Club boys and girls been seen in a body. Their enthusiasm and good spirits con - tinues to be an inspiring aid to the Nebraska State Fair. 4-H Club Style Show The 4-H Club style show before the grandstand in the evening drew a large crowd and won the complete approval of the audience. Some very beautiful costumes, handmade by the owners, were worn in the show and proved the ability of 4-H Club Work to interest young women in practical things: 4-H Health Contest Fifteen boys and fifteen girls from the 4-H Clubs entered the health contest. The same staff of doctors examined both the boys and girls. Each entry was over 15 years old and the county champion of his or her county. There was a large amount of interest In this feature of 4-H Club work. The winners received an ovation when they appeared before the grandstand on 4-H Club night. Education The Increasing demands for space for the Educational Depart - ment each year is evidence of the increased interest in educational displays. The 1930 display consumed all of the space on the south balcony In Agricultural Hall. The superintendent who has been in charge of the Educational Exhibits for a number of years, pronounced the 1930 exhibit to be the best ever. All kinds of written school work was displayed as well as some fine specimens of art work, manual training and domestic science. ■ ■ Spelling Contest The spelling contest will have to be continued because so many people are so deeply interested in it. Already the hall in which the contest is held is too small and a better and larger place will have to be found if the people who wish to hear the contest are accom - modated. High School Band Contest A large share of the band music heard at the 1930 Fair was produced by instruments played by members of Nebraska high school hands. Competition in the various classes of the high school band contest was very keen. Each band had its supporters who came to </seg>
            <seg id="p029">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE hear and applaud. The band contest has justified' its institution oy the interest it has added to the Fair. Baby Contest The interest in the baby contest seems unabated. The number of babies brought for inspection to the capable judges exceeded that of last year. This is a feature of the Fair that is exceedingly popular and brings hundreds of people who might not" otherwise be interested in coming. Nebraska State Fair on Wheels The great parade this year was the best ever seen at the Fair. It was four miles long and required an hour and twenty minutes to pass the grandstand. Practically every Gepartment was represented in some fashion in the parade. Veterans of three wars were in line. Fifteen bands made music. The Modern Woodmen of America had fix bands, seven floats and 600 people in line. The 4-H Club boys and girls made a most Impressive showing. Nebraska livestock never exhibited to better advantage as in this parade. The parade grows in size and importance every year because it is the high point of the Fair and enables visitors to get a good resume of the Fair in a very short space of time from a comfortable seat in the grandstand. So systematized has been the details of the parade that under- intelligent direction all departments move promptly and show to best advantage. Automobile Show Automobile Hall is always a place of interest for people who want to see the new models in automobiles. . Lincoln dealers generously display their machines and as usual the exhibit was one of the drawing cards of the Fair. Machinery There was every piece of machinery that could be used on the farm and in the farm home on exhibit. This display attracted people of all ages and nationalities, including four men from Russia who were here to select some types of machinery for their country- The various grinders and corn shuckers attracted the most attention. Two and four row corn pickers of all kinds were on exhibit. There were several new types of tractors on exhibit including many of the cater - pillar type. The machinery men handled their part in a way that was appreciated by those who worked with them, for they had every - thing ready and in place when the gates were open. The general comment was that the machinery exhibit was unusually good and very complete. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Bees and Honey This exhibit was the most elaborate honey exhibit ever showed at the Nebraska State Fair. The exhibit was moved from Agricultural Hall to the Lincoln building this year. It occupied 1,500 square feet. The exhibit departed from the traditional wall show to table exhibits which were more accessible to the people. The display was sufficiently large and good to impress visitors at the Fair with the importance of bees and honey in this state of abundant wild flowers garden flowers, alfalfa and clover. Dairy Products The display of dairy products was exceptionally good. The butter cow which has been seen for a number of years was succeeded this year by a butter buffald. A sign nearby explained, however, that the buffalo had not by any means displaced the dairy cow. State Institutions The exhibits of state institutions were moved this year from the balcony of Agricultural Hall to the grandstand. This proved a good arrangement, giving the institution larger and better quarters and allowing added exhibit space for the Domestic Products and Needle Work departments. Every institution under the direction of the Board of Control was represented with a good exhibit which afforded an opportunity for Fair visitors to learn what sort of work is being carried on In the various state institutions. Domestic Products [ - "The 1930 exhibit in this department in every way surpassed those of any of the past three years that I have worked in this De - partment," reported Mrs. C. H. Malsbury, superintendent. The total number of exhibitors was 167 with about 3,500 entries. This was an increase of. 28 exhibitors over 1929 and showed an increased Interest in this Department. Considerable added space was allowed this department, through a rearrangement of Agricultural Hall. This allowed a much better display and permitted the attendants to have a better contact with visitors. Many visitors reported it was the finest display of domestic products they had ever seen. Needle Work The Needle Work exhibit on the north balcony of Agricultural Hall had considerable more space this year and put on a much more effective showing. The display of handmade quilts incited a deal of admiration and was perhaps the outstanding feature of the exhibit. ■ ■■■ .- ' • i .■•■"' i ! </seg>
            <seg id="p031">. REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fine Arts The Fine Arts Department represented a higher standard of work throughout than ever before exhibited. Some able critics who visited the department commented upon this advance. . The oil landscape group was a large one and received much comment. A good many of the subjects were of Nebraska scenery. Nebraska's own beauty spots on canvas is a thing much encouraged by the department. An oil landscape picturing a covered wagon making Its way through Ne - braska was considered an outstanding piece of work. A picture of Nebraska wild flowers with goldenrod predominating was much ap - preciated. From every standpoint, size of the display included, the depart - ment represented a large and satisfactory exhibit of the best work of Nebraska artists. One hundred ninety-two exhibitors sent exhibits and 2,086 articles were judged. Ushers A group of Hl-Y • boys chosen from all over the state acted as ushers In the grandstand. This was a repetition of the plan of the year before and again proved a very fine arrangement. During their stay In Lincoln, the boys were under constant supervision and enjoyed visits, to state institutions and other Interesting experiences. The boys had a very happy eight days and the Fair had the benefit of the enthusiastic and courteous services. Gates About forty-five men were on duty at the gates. In the company were senators, members of the House of Representatives, attorneys, auctioneers, school superintendents and prominent business men and fnrmers who took this . method to make their contribution to the Fair. They rendeFed eight days of splendid service. The outstanding feature was the quiet courtesy and the ease with which they admitted and discharged nearly a half million people without an accident of any kind and scarcely a ripple of discontent or displeasure. Super - intendent Shubert instructed his men at the outset that their slogan would be, "Courtesy and Service." Each man caught the Idea and carried It to the finish. Public Safety The work of the Public Safety Department cannot be too highly commended. The courtesy of these men In directing traffic and giving general information aided the management very greatly in staging </seg>
            <seg id="p032">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE me great 1930 Fair. There was no disorder on the grounds and very few reports of lost or stolen articles. Press Bureau As has been the custom for several years, .a Press Bureau was maintained which supplied news of the Fair to newspapers of the state. The commodious quarters of the Bureau also afforded a gather - ing place for newspaper people. The press bureau has proved itself to be an important part of successful Fair work. Camp Ground The 5,000 campers on the Fair grounds seemed to be there for a good time. They enjoyed one of the finest weeks in the form of weather the State Fair has ever known. The ticket system was perfect. There was no stealing or pilfering reported. A large number of campers had been there before and knew exactly what they wanted and how to get it. There were several large groups that came together. In one instance eight cars came in together and six more came later, making fourteen cars from one county. With these all located on adjoining lots a home family party resulted. The camp ground at the Fair is very modern and everything necessary to comfort of the campers is of easy access. More and more people who drive into the Fair learn that camping on the grounds is the most efficient and economical way to see the Fair. Horseshoe Tournament Unusual interest was exhibited this year in the horseshoe tourna - ment. A number of new contenders for the honor of being Nebraska champion pitcher got their introduction to the State Fair crowd. But it was Guy Uhlig of Cozad who won the championship for the fourth time. Visitors at the Fair displayed their Interest in horseshoe pitch - ing by keeping the bleacher seats well filled. An improvement this year was a device for keeping the spectators informed of the progress of the matches. The interest showed that barnyard golf is still a popular pastime from the Missouri river to the Wyoming line. Cat and Bird Show The cat show and the bird show which were in adjoining quarters commanded a good deal of attention from people who are interested in cats and feathered friends. The Fair would be quite incomplete with - out these exhibits which have their enthusiastic followers. ■ i </seg>
            <seg id="p033">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fish Exhibit The fish exhibit supplied each year by the Game, Forestation and Park Commission, never fails to draw a steady stream of visitors. The establishment on the Fair grounds of the transfer station of the Com - mission has increased interest in the important work of the Commis - sion. The 1930 Fish Exhibit was up to the usual standard. The Midway Beckmann and Gerity were engaged for the Midway Attraction and no doubt had the most beautiful setting of any carnival that ever exhibited on the grounds. Many favorable comments come to our office in the way we conducted our midway. All games were eliminated several years ago, nor was there any attempt by the show management to over-ride any rules laid down by the Fair Board. Circus We engaged the John Robinson's Circus as a grandstand attrac - tion and it seemed to draw good crowds for the entire week. Auto Racing Three days were devoted to auto racing. The large crowds in the grandstand on these three days indicated that this form of sport is still popular with people. No track records were broken but some good contests were staged. . . Speed Followers of the track in Nebraska do not recall a Better racing program at the Nebraska State Fair than that of 1930. The track record was broken in the 2:10 pace, the three heats being timed at 2: 07%, 2:0.714 and 2:05%. . In the three year and under pace one heat was paced at 2:10% and in the 2:12 pace one heat was paced in 2:08%. This is a sample of the speed and competition in the harness events. In the running races some exciting events took place. Our superintendent of speed said: "Take it all in all, I think the racing at the Fair was the best, not only from a time standpoint but from the close contests, of any year in the history of the Fair. There were more horses on the grounds than I have even known before In the speed department. There were 125 harness horses and 71 run - ners." Fireworks The spectacular production in fireworks called "The Fall of Bab - ylon," made a splendid close for the evening's program and was en - joyed by all. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In Conclusion Now, in conclusion, I just want to say I would be ungrateful indeed if I did not mention the fine cooperation I have received on every hand. It is a great satisfaction to be connected with an organiza - tion where service is put above self. and where all are interested in the growth and prosperity of the institution to such an extent that they live in every day of the year. I want to thank everybody, especially the Superintendents, for so efficiently shouldering the responsibilities themselves, and not bothering any of the members of our Board with every little detail that arises. It is the cooperation we received from everyone connected with the Fair that made the 1930 Nebraska State Fair the success that It was. </seg>

Respectfully submitted, !• E. R. PURCELL, Chairman, J. F. SHUBERT, L. C. CHAPIN. I want to add to this report, that the books of the Nebraska State Fair are especially complete. I perhaps have been more familiar with them than some other members of the Committee, and for sometime I have been especially familiar with the accounting of this office. I feel absolutely safe in- saying from what knowledge I have so gained of that class of work that there is no office in the Capitol — and under its dome — where the. accounts are better kept, where matters are recorded more readily or a more efficient showing is made.

' By PRESIDENT LAMB: The next business in order will be the Report of the Revision Committee; By CHAIRMAN A. H.

To the . Honorable Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: Gentlemen: We, the Committee on the Revision of the 1931 Premium List, beg leave to submit the following report and recommend the follow - ing changes in the premium list: Change all dates to comply with the year of 1931. </seg>
            <seg id="p044">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Class "A" — Horses Page 33. Change amount offered by the Percheron Society of America from $100.00 to $75.00, a decrease of $25.00. You •will notice these Societies all through before gave us $100.00; now they are giving us a reduction of $25.00. Class "B" — Beef Cattle Page 48. Lot 4. Galloways. It is recommended that this breed be eliminated. Page 55. Fat Cattle. It is recommended that this classification be eliminated. Class "C" — Swine : Page 74. Lot 3. Spotted Poland China. The amount offered by the National Spotted Poland China Breeders Association has been reduced from $350.00 to $200.00. Total reduction $150.00. We had nothing to do with that. That is just what this Association has done. They said that is all they would do, so we must accept it that way. Class "DV — Goats Page 87. I/ot 10. Dairy Goats. No change is . recommended here, though there was some talk about it. Class "E" — Poultry •' Page 90. There are several little changes made; a change made here and one there, but they do not add materially. Insert after the fifth paragraph "Judging will begin Saturday morning at nine o'clock" and another paragraph to read: "Public, must keep hands out of coops." Page 01. Third paragraph changed to read as follows: 'Pens must consist of one male and four females, all of which must be fowls or chicks." This change omits the first sentence of the paragraph. Still on Page 01. Omit the sixth paragraph which reads, "Birds under weight will not be disqualified." We cut them out altogether. They used to bring in such chickens, now we don't want them. Page 92. Approximately the center of the page, first line of the paragraph changed to read: "Best displays, all varieties competing. In each of the American, . . . ." Fourth line of the same paragraph changed to read: "awarded by points: First, to count 6 points: . . . ." instead of-5 points as last year. Then on Page 93, Iiot 1 — American. The class for Jersey Giants. Two separate classes made for this breed — one for White Jersey GiantB and another for Black Jersey Giants. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Same page. Omit the . classes for Barred Plymouth Rocks or premium numbers 951 to 964 inclusive. The reason for that was it gave cockerel bred and pullet bred Plymouth Rocks a discrepancy in favor of former. The poultrymen told me that they themselves could hardly tell the difference, so what did they want them in the cata - logue for. Same page. Under the heading, "Plymouth Rocks" omit the class for "Columbia" and insert a class for "Exhibition Barred." Page 94. A new lot to be added. Lot 4A — Hatchery Class. For Young Pens only. All young pens must have been hatched and ex - hibited by the hatchery. Premiums offered on the following breeds: Barred Plymouth Rock, White Plymouth Rock, Rose Comb Rhode Island Red, Single Comb Rhode Island Red, White Wyandottes, Buff Leghorns, White Leghorn, White Minorca, Buff Orpington, White Orpington. Prizes for each breed to be as follows: First, $4.00; second, $3.00; third, $2.00; fourth, $1.00; fifth. Ribbon. Page 95. Lot 4A — Orientals changed to Lot 6 — Orientals. There is just that one change made there. Same page. It is recommended that Lot 5 — Polish. Lot 6 — Hamburgs, Lot 7 — French, and Lot 8 — Continentals,, be omitted. These recommended changes for the Poultry Department will mean a saving of $40.00. The old classification called for $749.00 and the new offers $709.00. Now we come to Class "F" — Farm Products Page 106. Lot a— Threshed Grass Seeds. We recommend the omission of 1651, 1652, 1658 and 1659. If there is any ques - tion, Mr. VonSeggern will explain why. We had a conference here with Mr. Stewart about this yesterday as to that and other matters. Page 109. We likewise acted on Lot 4 — Items 1726 to 1731 inclusive. Page 111— Lot 7. Vegetables. Revise the old classification of nine varieties. No. 1786 — Garlic — to be placed under Lot 8, No. 1834. Premiums slightly reduced, instead of paying $2.00 first, we re - duce the premiums to: First, $1.50;- second, $1.00, and third, 75c; on Potatoes. Continuing on Lot 7 — Vegetables. Revise the old classification of nine varieties, as I started to say. It is recommended that only the varieties being grown on a commercial scale in Nebraska be in - cluded in a new classification, namely: Early Ohio, Irish Cobbler, Rural New Yorker and Triumph. The other varieties should be dropped because they are not grown to any </seg>
            <seg id="p046">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE appreciable extent at any place in the state and they are not varieties which should be encouraged. The ottering of seven or eight prizes on Irish Cobblers and Early Ohios is more desirable than the offering of a fewer number of prizes on varieties which are not recommended for producing in Nebraska. The next changes go to another class: Class "It" — Boys' and Girls' Club Work A number of changes have been made here. Page 192. I might add if there are any questions here, Mr. Frisbie is present, and as he made these recommendations, I know he will be glad to answer any questions that might be asked, and he will explain why such changes have been made. Paragraph Three, Page 192, as worded reads: "Any exhibitor who is found to have tampered with, doctored or entered an exhibit that is not his or her work will forfeit any premium ribbon and cash prize won. In case of such livestock put through the sale ring and slaughtered on Nebraska markets, the tran - saction shall be declared a no sale. This is what I understand that to mean: We have been getting too big baby beeves. They haven't been "babies." They should be put in the steer class, and in the proper weight classification. By CHAIRMAN MILLER: I move the adoption of the report. Motion seconded. By PRESIDENT LAMB: It has been moved and seconded that the Report of the Revision Committee be adopted. All in favor of the motion, say AYE. Contrary, NO. By MEMBER PERRY REED: I would like to move that the Board of Managers be empowered to make chairges that may seem necessary and feasible in the Premium List from now on.

We have a. little time left, perhaps twenty or thirty minutes. • We will receive the final report of the Credentials • Committee and a reso - lution that Mr. Graff has ready, the first thing in the morning. Motion to adjourn until 9:00 o'clock Wednesday morning, made and seconded, and carried. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">REPORT OF NEBRASKA«-£TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE ANNUAL BANQUET of the NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and the NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY FAIR MANAGERS Hotel Cornhusker, January 20, 1031 HON. CLARK OBERLIES, introduced as General Toastmaster, with more than usual wit, and his ever-present humor, introduced the next speaker as being responsible for the fun-pace of the evening. Clark then introduced HON. E. .P. BROWN, to act as the Final Toastmaster of the evening and direct the remaining tortures. He introduced Hon. Adrian Newens, who carried on the spirit of pleasantry at the expense of several others present. Mrs. Newton W. Gaines led the community singing and several numbers were thus rendered. Secretary Jackson introduced the man who runs the fair, Morris Rickenbach. Regrets were expressed for the inability of Hon. Frank Tomson to be present and continue his unfinished discussion of last year. The Toastmaster then introduced Hon. Ned Abbott, of Nebraska City. He discoursed in a semi-serious strain for a few minutes, and closed with a comment upon the attempted sarcasm of H. L. Mencken, of Maryland, in recently calling Nebraska a "cow state" and closed with the remark, he believed he preferred the white product of the cow in Nebraska to the white mule of some of the Atlantic coast states. Mr. Alec Sloan of Chicago was then introduced. By MR. SLOAN: One of the particular things I have been taught to obey are these signs on the road. I was told by Mr. Jackson I wouldn't have an opportunity to talk because there were not any detour signs on this program, so I will try to keep on a straight road, now that I have this opportunity. When I come to Nebraska there is every inducement to feel right at home. I have attended three state fair banquets and three state fair association meetings In the last eight or ten days, and if you knew how favorably you compare with any of the others, you would readily recognize the absence of discord and the different spirit that prevails here from some of the places I have attended. The Toastmaster then introduced some of those present, asking them to stand up and .be viewed by those present, with a regret there was no time to hear from all of them. He then introduced F. C. Radke, Secretary to the Governor. Allen G. Burke, former Speaker of the House, was likewise introduced. Adrian M. Newens was then called upon and entertained with his usual wit and philosophy. Walter Whitten of the Lincoln Chamber </seg>
            <seg id="p048">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or commerce was next introduced, and the Toastmaster then Intro - duced the man who had been selected to succeed to the post of Dean of the College of Agriculture, when Chancellor Burnett was called upon to take his present post. Dean .W. W. Burr. DEAN BURR spoke briefly, commenting: Mr. Toastmaster, and Friends: I am very happy to be here this evening. Of all the Colleges, I believe our relationship to not only the State Fair, but the County Fairs are perhaps the most closely established. We believe they are doing, and have done, a very fine wtfrk. I certainly feel that, as I look back through the years, as I have known the Nebraska State Fair, that the men who have built that fair have made it not only materially successful, but in every way educational. They have done so much to make it a clean and outstanding fair — the most clean and outstanding of the United States, and I think we all know they have the appreciation of the people of this State. But I think we might Increase that by urging everyone who speaks of it to say "our state fair." We are helpless in the eyes of the people of the State in our work, unless they speak of it and feel toward it, as "our college." I know that is the way the people who have served on the State Board of Agriculture also feel. Again, I want to say I am happy to have been here. The Toastmaster then called attention to the fact that the whistles, horns and other novelties and some decorations had been the con - tribution of S'aunders Gordon, and introduced Mr. Gordon to those present. A series of musical numbers were then presented by a group from the Joe Marion Orchestra, known as the Co-eds. Mr. Marion was introduced and made a few observations concerning his seven years of delightful experiences in working in Nebraska. Mr. R. W. McGinnis of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad, which had so generously furnished the music of its band, was introduced. Mr. Mike Barnes of Chicago was presented, and then the Toastmaster turned loose the main speaker of the evening, MR. NEWTON W. GAINES. Mr. Gaines raced along at his usual high speed, from one fine thought to another finer one, and in concluding said in part: "George Jackson is now head of the greatest fair on earth; he is where he is and what he is today because way back in. the begin - ning of the boys' and girls; club work he foresaw what it could be - come and had the foresight to build It up. He could realize what it would do as a character-building job'. As a leader of boys' and girls' club work in the State Fair we built this work up to its present scope. We have got to know our young people. They are certainly a different class than we used to have. They get five times as far in about one-fifth of the time, and make good five times as often. We have to organize five times more carefully. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">report op Nebraska State board op agriculture I want to give you one concrete example and then I am going to close. This is one example of the kind of character-building this work accomplishes. It is an example, not only of the education gained, but what this work will do in a home. How it will bring about an appreciation of dad and mother, it builds up judgment, interest and respect. This is an actual case in the southern part of the state. One man talked so much about his fine hogs that he aroused my interest and I was glad to respond to an invitation to go out to the place and see his stuff. One of the boys insisted on displaying his great Hampshires. He said he had been in a Pig Club for three years and this year he was going to knock them cold — he had the finest litter of Hampshires. Just look at his pigs. Then his brother came up and said he belonged to the same Pig Club, but he wouldn't raise Hampshires and if you wanted to see some real pigs you should take a look at his Poland Chinas. He was quite anxious we should be shown his pigs. We must also see the father's stuff which was the Duroc Red, and of which we just knew both boys were in their hearts justly proud. You could just savvy each one was sticking up for his own brand, but were secretly proud of what the other was doing. You could just see Dad was swelling with pride over what those boys were doing and those boys were likewise proud of what their Dad had accomplished, no matter what they would say of their own efforts. You simply cannot estimate the amount accom - plished by the co-operation of those three, and those boys had come . to appreciate Dad. They didn't talk about what the old fool had been doing. You could just tell how Dad felt about it on the other hand. The boys fe.lt that thrill of ownership that is at the beginning of building character, thrift and success and it was interwoven into the life of that family. We then found out the girl in that family belonged to a poultry club and she had one incubator that had yielded the first hatching of chickens. The point I am getting at is this: something had gotten into that home -that had furnished a common topic of conversation. Dad, mother, boys and the girl had found something common in life . on that farm. Dad and Mother as they sat three times a day with those youngsters Instead of talking about frivilouB matters could talk about things of common interest and weave themselves into the life of each of the others. They are storing memories that those children can bring forth twenty-five years from now about Dad and Mother and cherish. The boys can say to Dad: "Don't you remember how we used to get after each other about our hog raising." They can talk about it then when these boys and the girl have made successful men and women, when such boys and girls have become the men and women who will run our State of Nebraska. Some of them may go </seg>

To express in mere words how I feel about this work, I can only say that my vocabulary is too weak, and we can only say to those directing it, "Good Luck and God Bless you." Good Night. The assembly then concluded its program and dispersed, with the memories of an occasion that had proven to be all George Jackson had said it would be. ' ■ I • FORENOON SESSION, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 21, 1931 Ballroom — Cornhusker Hotel By PRESIDENT LAMB: The meeting will please come to order. We must hurry along with our work or we will be here until after the noon hour. The Secretary will call the roll of Members and Delegates. (Secretary calls the roll and shows a quorum present.) By PRESIDENT LAMB: Has the Credentials Committee any further report to make; if so, we would like to hear from them at this time. By CHAIRMAN CHAS. GRAFF: Mr. President of this conven - tion, the Credentials Committee has nothing to report in addition to what it reported yesterday, with one exception. There is a report In here from a fair called Agricultural Society and Corn Show of Frontier County, located at Eustis, Nebraska. I understand a similar report was made a year ago. There was nothing done then about It. I believe, gentlemen, that this convention should take some action :-on that report. I understand this Board has not the right — no authority legally, to admit any dual agricultural society of any county in the State of Nebraska, where there is one already existing that has been recognized by this Board. But I think our organization should go on record as to what disposition has been made or should be made of this Frontier County Agricultural Society and Corn Show. There is also a protest from Stockville, stating that the society there is a member of the State Board of Agriculture and they protest against the Eustis Society being admitted to this Board. The Stock - ville people also tell us that the matter is now in court, so I think it is up to us to make some disposition of that report from the Eustis fair. I do not like to make that motion but we should take action. By PRESIDENT LAMB: We should have a motion before the House in order to act upon it. </seg>
            <seg id="p051">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By CHAIRMAN GRAFF: Then I would move that the applica - tion of the.Eustls Society and their report filed here be rejected, and that they be so notified. Motion duly seconded. By PRESIDENT LAMB: You have heard the motion, gentlemen. Are there any remarks? All in favor of the motion say "Aye"; those oposed "No." The motion is carried. By PRESIDENT LAMB: We will now receive the report of the Resolutions Committee: By CHAIRMAN GRAFF: We present the following resolution: All rise to their feet while this is read. Appreciation of Charles Grau Mr.- Charles Grau, whose passing on December 13, 1930, brought a sense o" sorrow to every member of the Board of Agriculture that knew either him or his work intimately, will be remembered long for the contribution he made to Nebraska agriculture. His experience as a successful farmer enabled him to be an example and counsellor to others. His interest in agriculture was reflected in the long and excellent work he did as Superintendent of Agriculture at the Nebraska State Fair for five years, until 111 health compelled him to relinquish the exacting duties. He was elected a member of the Board of Agri - culture in 1025 and served continuously thereafter until his death. His ability as a farmer, his standing as a citizen and his devotion to his friends were important parts of his daily living. He lived a simple, useful, constructive lite, and when his time came to go, he left a modest but deep inscription of usefulness in the annals of his state and community. Respectfully submitted, GATES' LILLEY, R. WIDLE, . CHARLES GRAFF, Committee. By CHAIRMAN GRAFF: I might add that at the meeting of the County Fair Association this same resolution was adopted after the Resolutions Committee there had it introduced In its report. The Resolutions Committee of this meeting also had a resolution presented to it along the same lines from the Douglas County Fair Board, of which 'Charlie Grau was a member. He had been identified with the Douglas County Agricultural Society for many years to iny personal- knowledge. I will read to you this resolution and then I will request that this resolution also be embraced in our annual reso - lutions, and Included In our annual report. </seg>

By CHAIRMAN GRAFF: I do not know, Mr. Chairman, as I have anything more to offer on behalf of the Credentials Committee. There are no doubt parties here who have neglected to get their credentials properly before this body, and I hope there won't be any misunderstandings arise later on with those who have not complied with the rules. The Credentials Committee is powerless, as it Is only an agent of this Board.

            <seg id="p053">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By SECRETARY JACKSON: Senator Wherry wishes attention called again to the Meeting of the Short Racing Circuit at 2:00 o'clock P. M. at the Lancaster Room. By PRESIDENT LAMB: At this time we will now proceed with the voting on our candidates for membership on the Board for this coming year. I will appoint as Tellers, Mr. Portwood and Mr. Lilley. Balloting proceeded and ballots collected by the Tellers, who proceeded to a count of the votes. By PRESIDENT LAMB: While we are waiting for the ballots to be canvassed, we have with us the man who is head of the Publicity Department and we would be pleased to receive a report of those activities. By MR. J. G. ALDEN: The Publicity Department is a part of the State Pair activities. The Legislature two years ago made an appropriation which was given to the State Board of Agriculture to be used as. it saw fit in publicity for the State. The State Board set up the Department of Publicity of which I am Director. In the few months in which we have been operating we have accomplished a considerable amount of good in Nebraska, In dis - seminating various channels of information, in the different sorts and manners of publicity which the Department has put forth. You may not know, but we have beeYi running in weekly news - papers as well as in the daily newspapers a very interesting account of Nebraska activities. These have been furnished by the Department of Publicity under the State Fair Board. They are put out without any idea of showing they came from the State Fair Board or the Department of Publicity. We really represent that this matter came from the Editor himself, because if the material was presented as coming from the Department the impression would be gained that It was propaganda and its interest might be destroyed to many. Now two hundred and thirty newspapers in Nebraska are co - operating with the State Fair Board and Department of Publicity in giving out this important information about Nebraska activities. The vast amount of material showing the development of the resources and the industries of the State of Nebraska is partially distributed In other ways each week. Seven radio stations in Nebraska are broadcasting weekly stories about Nebraska that are furnished by this Publicity Department and the responses that come back to the Department about these broadcasts are very gratifying indeed. The letters that come to the stations are forwarded to our De - partment and show a most interesting attention to this phase of the work. In order to work up a public spirit abroad that will awaken to the merits of our state and measure up to the state pride we should have within our borders, it will be necessary for us to have a better understanding of Nebraska ourselves. That is exactly what the Public- </seg>
            <seg id="p054">RErORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ny Department is trying to do — to give the people of Nebraska a better understanding of our own resources; so they may- have a keener understanding or how this state has come up in seventy-five yearB to take its place in the roster of states that it has attained, for us to get some better conception of how important this state really is in its relationship to the other states and to appreciate the development it has already made. Those are some of the things that the State Department of Publicity is attempting to do. I think you men of the State Pair Association represent interests that are much interested in knowing we have made such a fine start and we are hoping that this coming legislature, now just beginning its sessions, will not only continue the Department, but that it will increase it so we may do some of the things we have in mind and will allow us to take ad - vantage of this splendid start we have, so we may expand this task of knowing Nebraska .as a State. I thank you. By MEMBER E. R. PURCELL: May I say just a word on this? By PRESIDENT LAMB: I thought we might be getting some - thing interesting started pretty soon. By MR. PURCELL: I did not know. Mr. Alden was coming be - fore the meeting here. There are some things -he left unsaid that I thought I would like to fill in with. I don't know whether the mem - bers of the State Board of Agriculture fully realize how fortunate this Department of Publicity is in the man who is handling that work of publicity. Mr. Alden has had a great deal of experience in the years past in this sort or work and he has furnished to the State of Nebraska, through the newspapers, a great deal of material which they have been glad to run without money or price involved. It has been a very high class or material. I didn't come here or get up to throw bou - quets at Joe Alden, particularly, but I do want to leave this thought with this meeting. Mr. Chairman, that the State Publicity Department has become recognized as a function of. the State Fair Board, and -we hav&lt;&gt; an opportunity during the next few years, if this work is con - tinued, to do a wonderful work for Nebraska. I want to leave this thought with the members here that perhaps there might be some disposition on the part of the Legislature, though I haven't been in close touch with them, to recognize this work so, that instead of con - fining it to its present scope, the Legislature should increase this appropriation sufficiently to do greater things than it can attempt under its present organization. I believe this is what we should at - tempt right now, that the Publicity Department has been started and it-should be aided to attempt, bigger things. I believe our member - ship should, bear .in mind that this State Department of Publicity is credJ.Ubly functioning .under the State Board of Agriculture. ■ -By HENRY SUNDERMAN (Madison): In connection with this, I just wanted to bring out one phase cf this work. Last year we got a pamphlet sent out through the office, the title of which was, "What </seg>
            <seg id="p055">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Do You Know About Nebraska?" This portrayed much that w»o ul interest to children; the pamphlet was prepared in plain language so as to be of interest to children. It pointed out many interesting facts, and all down the line. It was so interesting that I showed it to our Professor of Schools and he sent in for a few of those copies. I suggested that to him and he said he would. I sent in myself for some copies and I distributed them. I know that little pamphlet was really a jewel for those who received it. It outlines in such short plain words what we have in Nebraska, and I would like to have the Secretary of our Board see that we continue to receive things along the same line. I know this is doing some good. and will accomplish an untold amount of good as scattered through our schools. By MEMBER FRANK SHUBERT (Shubert): I would like to say just a word or so;, that is this: if we hope to get a larger appro - priation from the Legislature for this State Agency, it would be within the power of this body to get busy and demand this work be enlarged. If the State Board of Agriculture feels this should be done we would be quite justified in getting busy with the Legislature to see that there is no question about this appropriation, the same as other in - dustries have done, so far as the Nation is concerned. We should get appropriations for agriculture. I am very. much in favor of this body working with the legislature of this state for securing a reasonable appropriation for this purpose to continue the work of the Publicity Department, which has been so ably conducted by Mr. Alden. By DIRECTOR J. G. ALDEN: I would like to answer a question raised by Mr. Sunderman. That is about the little pamphlet — Nebraska Nuggets. It is in its second edition now and has reached 90,000 copies. Copies of this little book have been sent to every teacher and every school in Nebraska, in what we considered a sufficient number, for every teacher to present the facts to the students. Since that time teachers have been sending in for enough for certain classes and a sufficient number for the use of such classes have been mailed to them. At the last Fair we gave out thirty or forty thousand copies to visitors at the Fair. If any of you have not received this book, or know where it could be sent to good advantage, send us word to the Publicity Department of State Fair Board offices. By C. B. STEWARD. (Lincoln) : I think the work of the Publicity Department is very fine so far as it goes forward to the people of the State of Nebraska. But I wish Mr. Alden would tell us what plans have been made toward advertising Nebraska to the rest of the World? By DIRECTOR J. G. ALDEN: I will be glad to speak on that for a moment. Under an appropriation of Ten Thousand Dollars a year, it isn't possible to do very many things, even with the splendid co-operation we have been extended outside of the Department, that extend our operations outside of the State. We have worked as hard </seg>
            <seg id="p056">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE! *a we could in our own state, but we haven't been able to expand this work to a broader field. However, bear this in mind that every little pamphlet sent out through Nebraska is apt to be sent on — that every little story appearing in a Nebraska newspaper is read abroad to some extent. I think Mr. Purcfill and others here will bear me out in this statement, that at least ten or fifteen per cent of the circula - tion of every newspaper, especially every weekly newspaper goes abroad — out of the state, so that every news item we have or do circulate about Nebraska does have some foreign circulation. The matter Mr. Steward spoke about, as to reaching the outside World in telling about Nebraska, is something that must come later, a little bit later when we have the money to reach out into magazines and avail ourselves of other mediums. By CHARLES GRAFF: When the Chair first requested anyone who wished to make any remarks on this matter to speak, I wondered what anyone would have to say. For twenty years, gentlemen, I have been connected with this body. When I first came on this Board, I wondered what it was all about. I wondered what the duties were for this Board, and all those things. I knew nothing about it, and now I wonder to this present day how many people know at this time what the duties are of the State Board of Agriculture. Do they even know this is a legal body created by the statutes in this state? It is created by one of, if not the only, laws In the statute books of this state which has never been amended and has stood there almost from the beginning of the state. A lot of people do not seem to know much about what this par - ticular Board has to do; or what we are here to do. Having been a member of it for twenty years, I feel that I know something about it. I have had some opportunity to tell the people up in my part of the country something about It, especially among the educational people. A couple times recently I have been called upon to appear before schools to give them about a thirty-minute talk in the schools, prin - cipally to High Schools, and other young people about what the State Board of Agriculture is doing and how it functions. But many people in Nebraska have a sort of an idea that there is politics connected with it. Now. the remarks that have just been made on this floor about how this body should interest itself in a way in that appropriation, as a body, and to register its desire that a larger appropriation be made for this purpose than was made two years ago, is something I rather disagree with. I may be for the purpose of that larger ap - propriation, but I am not in favor, men, of the method proposed. I am not in favor of the state being tight and penurious, and I know we have a story that is worth while, but I don't want to make that kind of a sacrifice of our policy. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE I don't know. I have been requested to become a lobbyUi be - fore this Legislature now in session. I know lots of men in this session of the- Legislature. It might be all right to be a lobbyist and see them, but I have never been before a legislature as a lobbyist. If I do any lobbying before this legislature this winter I don't intend to be arrested; I hope to keep away from that, and I have never been arrested — so much for that. Neither do I want the word to go out over the State that I am a lobbyist before a Legislature in this state, and whatever I have to put up before that body I am willing to do it face to face or write it out, and face the world with it. You know how the people construe a lobbyist in appearing before the Legislature and the word "lobbyist" puts a bad taste in the mouth of the uninformed citizen. They think of him as a pest; as a man not to be trusted; as a man who has got some personal axe to grind, or as having something to put across, for proposed legislation, or otherwise. Now, I think it is up to us, man for man, to do our fullest duty as a citizen; every man connected with the State Board of Agriculture should take more or less interest in these affairs. He should make it a point to confer with and advise with its representative and his senator from his own district. He should be informed about matters of this character and when he comes down here as an accredited dele - gate, he should be prepared to give such matters the attention they deserve. You should be able when you come to these matters to be able to do something about them — and to know what has been done down here. You should also be able to go home and intelligently inform your own people of what this body has done, and what it is trying to do for them. You then have an opportunity to put it before the men whom you represent, more clearly than perhaps has been done in the past. I have always been able, and mighty glad, to have men in whom I had confidence, representative men in any community or any other part of the State of Nebraska, come to me and say, "Charlie, I want to talk to you" and have' me explain for them what they had in mind. We. send men down to the National Congress to legislate. Yet, not one in five thousand of us ever write down to our congressmen and let him know what we want him to represent or what we want him to do. We leave him there surrounded by high-powered fellows attempting to prevail on him to do this or that or the other thing, which is not representative of the wishes or needs of the people back home. I have had some experience with these lobbyists in Washing - ton. I have had close contacts with Judge Evans, who has passed on, but was District Judge and- then Congressman from our territory. Right in his office, when he was in Congress, he explained to me how many telegrams he got, and communications of all kinds to advise him on thfe or that and not a single one of them from his own con- </seg>
            <seg id="p058">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE stituents at home. It was so very clear that most of these telegrams were manufactured somewhere else to influence sentiment. Con - gressman Evans emphasized how anxious one was to get letters from his own people, but he didn't then have a one. We make a lot of noise in Nebraska, we are dissatisfied with this or that or the other thing, but how much do you men do about it? You men should realize that the man who represents you in the Legislature or in the National Congress find nothing they will pay more attention to, so no matter how poorly it is written out, no matter how poor the phrase - ology that may be used, how poorly spelled it may be, a representative appreciates the message from his constituent, and he is going to pay more attention to it. Just a few of those kind of letters really count with men in Congress or in the Legislature more than any other effort that can be made. That is what I want you to do. That is the kind of action I am asking for, without involving our organization into any new sort of a policy. Let's not forget. By MR. C. B. STEWARD: It isn't often that I have to disagree with Charlie Graff, but here is one time when I am going to claim the right to disagree with him, for I do riot view his definition or viewpoint of a lobbyist in labeling them as an undesirable element. In our legislative circles the term lobbyist is coming to have an entire - ly different meaning from what it used to have. That is one reason for requiring a lobbyist to register; so the public may know what he represents or what he is seeking to do. It has been my duty to appear before Legislatures and Legislative Committees on certain bills and I have registered as representing certain organizations. Likewise, Mr. Graff has been at Washington in the interest of certain interests in which he believes should receive support. Isn't a Congressman in the same position as a Member of the State Legislature; isn't the proposition the same thing in dealing with one as the other? Private Interests of every sort and description are alert in securing support or opposition to legislation that interests them. A lobbyist is any man who appears before a legislative committee to lay the facts be - fore them. Here are my good friends, John McLellan and Senator Purcell who have served in the Legislature and they understand the distinction. No particular member or delegate here today is able to give the time necessary to take up this issue and present all the facts to the legislature. We must rely on a presentation of the proper information by men who know and we cannot afford to refuse that opportunity and privilege and I say to you when the chance arises to present the facts we know that will assist in getting proper legisla - tion, and we can present them to Congress or to the State Legisla - ture, it is our duty to do it. and it is time to do it. What our legisla - tors want to do is to find out the true facts about the situation that is what they want to do today; he doesn't come down with the idea of putting something across; if you really want to "serve Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p059">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE we must present these matters, and I take a different view ul •» lobbyist these days from wfiat Charlie Graff has been presenting. By CHAS. GRAFF: I didn't mean to single Charlie out as any example of what I said of a lobbyist. I said the uninformed people out over the country do look upon a lobbyist as a darned pest, an undesirable citizen — I mentioned that as the viewpoint of the unin - formed people and not of Charlie Steward. By SECRETARY JACKSON: It is just too bad to get these two lobbyists in a debate before a Board of this kind. By CHAS. GRAFF: I don't think I have anything more on my chest, but I would be pleased to hear from H. J. McLaughlin, who has come back to the good old farm. By PRESIDENT LAMB: Yes, we would like to hear from Mr. McLaughlin. By MEMBER H. J. McLAUGHLIN: Mr. Chairman, I didn't want to say anything, but this presents an opportunity, however, that I think should not be passed by. I have been a member for a good many years. But for the co-operation that was offered to me, I would never have undertaken the work that I have been doing for the last six years. As a matter of fact, I would never have taken on this work if it had not been due to the urging of the members of the State Board of Agriculture, who wishes me to do that. I don't know how many of you men grasp the importance of the work of the State Department of Agriculture and how it is second to none of all work done in our state government. It is not generally recognized. I want to explain one or two phases that I hope will be continued. \ hope you men will see the importance of insisting that it does. I am now going to refer to the bovine tuberculosis work. I sincerely trust this work will be continued and carried on as it has been. I want to tell j'ou a few things about how we did that work. I made an agreement when I first entered the office with the Federal Department to gather and provide the agricultural statistics of the state. That agreement has been functioning, especially with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Mr. Jackson will bear me out in the statement that this department has kept it functioning. I be - lieve it is of the greatest importance. I think the Legislature this year should see to it that work is carried on, so that the good work we have done since I came into that office six years ago is not lost. At. that time, when I came in, there were seyen counties in the state under surveys for " eradication of tuberculosis.. No others had been accredited. " At the present time there are flf ty-four counties . under observation — and forty-six of these counties have been accredited. Now, here is the situation we are facing, men. That Is a stoppage of tlie work we have been doing. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The market for our feeding cattle is the four states of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. They furnish the greatest market for our cattle. There was a conference held in Michigan on the ninth of September, and there a resolution was passed to the effect that as each of the states cleaned up they would place an embargo against all cattle coming in unless they came in from clean dairies. Michigan is placing such a restriction as this; Ohio will soon place such a restriction and Indiana will soon do so. If -we are cleaned up next year, we would remain in a position to use these markets. Illinois and Iowa are not quite so close to being cleaned up. If this work ■should be junked in the state of Nebraska, it will cost the people of Nebraska a Million Dollars loss in their market for our feeding cattle. It is that important. Another thing that I would like to present to you here, and I have been talking to Mr. Jackson some about this. The Department of Agriculture and the State Board of Agriculture should be one. Now I think so much of both of these organizations or state agencies, that I don't mean for a minute to say that the State Board of Agri - culture should be abolished, nor perhaps should the Department of Agriculture. But I think they should be combined and the State De - partment thus taken out of politics. This might mean a reorganiza - tion and provide for all of this work being done under one head. I have felt this for several years. I know it has been done in other states and I feel it should be done in this state. Whether it can be done in this present session, I don't know. I doubt it. I don't know what these lobbyists are doing. But I do know that this work is important. I have seen so much of this work and come to realize its importance in the last six years. Now, I didn't mean to talk this long when called upon. Knowing as I do now the importance of this work, I would like to see these two organizations brought together. It has been the custom of Governors in the past to overlook this matter. After this the money should be appropriated to the State Board of Agriculture and there should be only one Board, that is the State Board of Agriculture; in other words, there should be a combination of the two activities, with the various activities of agriculture properly represented. Here is 'Mr. Banning who is in - terested in the horticultural industry. I don't know whether we have any nurserymen in the audience, but there is that industry, but they are concerned in carrying on all of these lines of work. If all of the work was placed under one body, organized as is the State Board of Agriculture now, it would be conducted even more efficiently. Before I close I do want to call the attention of this Board to the co-operation I have had in the last six years, and thank all of you for that co-operation. It has been a great privilege to do this work, and though part of the work has been rather strenuous, and it was almost too big a job for one man to do. A man needs lots of assist- </seg>
            <seg id="p061">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRtCULtOStE ance in that work, but It has been a great pleasure to me. U lu » work was combined with the State Board of Agriculture, we would have a complete organization. There should be no Question about your getting an appropriation big enough to carry on the Publicity Bureau. That character of work is a part of your task'. The work so far has accomplished much of benefit for the state. The statistical work should also be a part of the work of this Board. I don't know whether this statistical work will continue. That is perhaps up to the Governor coming in. I trust it will be carried on. Our final report will show we have collected $407,000.00 in fees and spent $235,000.00 in carrying on our work and the rest of that suni went into the General Fund and has been used to carry on the general activities of the State. By PRESIDENT LAMB: We want to thank Mr. McLaughlin for this valuable talk he has given to us. I understand we have about ten minutes yet before we can expect the report of the tellers upon their count of the ballots. By MR. S. B. MOREHEAD (Albion) : In regard to this little pamphlet. Somebody was kind enough to send one of those to my home. I read it, and after I read it, my wife read it and then I took the trouble to write in to secure some to send to some of my friends and had them sent to some addresses I furnished.' They went to my friends in outside states where I considered it one of the best little pamphlets I had ever run across and thought it was one of the best advertisements we could give our state. Judge Lightner of our Dis - trict Court came from Columbus to hold court in our county and when he went through one of these little pamphlets, he said, "I am going to see Nebraska." I only noticed one thing it is short on, I would like to have printed on the cover the next time you print an edition; That is, "God made the heaven and the earth; then He made and separated the land from the sea; He finished His work and looked it over and said that is good; then He made Nebraska — adorned it with beautiful fields, equipped it with comforts for the happiness of man — time rolled on until Nebraska has progressed, men have grasped the situation where today we boast of the fact of being the greatest state in the Union. By PRESIDENT LAMB: I am proud of the fact that Mr. More - head succeeded me as Secretary of the Boone County Fair. He Is one of the old time residents of our part of the state of Nebraska. By MR. E. R. PURCELL: It looks to me like we have over - looked a good Assistant Director for the publicity department. By HENRY STJNDERMAN: I would just like to ask the Publicity man if I understood him right — did he say that they had issued a second edition similar to that pamphlet and sent it out to the teachers? </seg>
            <seg id="p062">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By MR. ALDEN: We did. this last summer. I think one was sent to the Secretary of all Fairs. By MR. SUNDERMAN: I wish you would do that, if it has not already been done. By SECRETARY JACKSON: There is another thing we are try - ing to do in that office, as we have come back on publicity again. We are trying to compile a course of study on Nebraska for study clubs. We have study clubs all over the state to go over together the history of Nebraska and to impress on them the importance of our state. We will be glad to furnish these not only to teachers and secretaries, but to any leaders of such clubs so they can study this course. We are showing how our government raises the taxes, what they are spent for — and step by step we are coming up to our present structure of government; we are telling them all about Capitol and State Govern - ment; how the state's money is raised; how it is spent; we are out - lining the State Departments and showing what their respective duties are; we will show the resources of the state; we will outline and analyze the county governments; then take the schools and show what the school money goes for, and in fact every effort of the state will be shown. If we get a sufficient demand for this material, we will be glad to bring this material up to date and include it in this work and furnish it to these study clubs, for our schools or any other activities or organizations that want to know these facts. I feel that if we can get this started there will be a full appreciation of this work. . . You folks know we have many beauty spots in our state and that if you drive over this state and see a few of them you. begin to realize what we have in our state; and if we get these clubs inter - ested, and get our schools interested we can get more co-operation in these tasks. If you are interested in this project drop Mr. Alden a card. We cannot go ahead with it unless we know we have the co-operation and interest of enough people to assure its success. 1 know Mr. Alden will agree with me that he will be pleased to have your interest manifested, and show our plans are worth while. By PRESIDENT LAMB: We will now receive the results of the ballot. By SECRETARY JACKSON: The vote cast upon the first ballot shows, as follows: First District C. H.

            <seg id="p064">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Nebraska State Fair for a very very long term of years. I think he went on this Board in 1917 and I recall that when Mr. Reed was chosen on this Board he was not present, and he did not know of his election until perhaps he may have seen It in the newspapers at home. But I want to say, gentlemen, we made no mistake when we elected Perry Reed as a member of this Board. Mr. Reed has been a very useful citizen of Nebraska; his work In the State Senate has been another wonderful contribution to our state; his work on the State Board of Agriculture has been very outstanding. It was my privilege when I occupied the place Mr. Lamb occupies at this time to appoint Senator Reed as a member of the Board of Managers and I found it was a splendid appointment and he made a most excellent worker there and he became more intensely interested in the activities and the business of this State Fair, and I am sure that if he is elected he will make a most splendid executive, so I really take pleasure in nominating Senator Reed for President of this Board. Nomination seconded from the floor. By A. H. MILLER: I move that the rules be suspended and the Secretary cast the unanimous ballot of this assembly for Perry Reed for President. Motion seconded. Question put by the Chairman. Vote taken and motion carried unanimously. By SECRETARY GEORGE JACKSON: It affords me much pleas - ure to cast the unanimous ballot of this convention for Perry Reed for President. By PRESIDENT LAMB: Mr. Reed, we would like to have a few words from you. By PRESIDENT-ELECT REED: Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen of this convention and friends: I want to thank you for the honor you have conferred on me. I expect to do my best and give all I have in me, as I have tried to do in the past. I appreciate the honor and I want to say to Mr. Lamb I only hope I may conduct this office as splendidly and efficiently as he has in the past, and that when the time comes for me to pass my duties on to my successor I may leave everything in. as good shape as he is doing. I thank you very much. By PRESIDENT LAMB: The next order of business is the nom - ination and election of a First Vice-President. By MR. W. B. BANNING: I want to present for election to the office of First Vice-President a man who has taken a deep interest in the agricultural work; who has been a very fine worker on this State Board of Agriculture; who has served on the executive board and for the past two years has been a very satisfactory Second Vice- President, so I want to present for nomination for the office of First Vice-President, Mr. Irl D.

By CHARLES GRAFF: We come now to the task of making a selection of a man, as an addition to "this Board of Managers; and I wish to propose a man who has had a chance to demonstrate his worth and ability, and his value to this organization. The service he has already given entitles him to be elected to this position, and as we come to a candidate for Second Vice-President, I deem it a privilege to propose for this position a man who merits the promo - tion, from the chance I have had to observe his work; a man who is full of vigor and vim; a man who certainly does things — even if he has not done all he should, for he hasn't even got'a wife yet; this man being Bert Miller and he hails from Washington County; so it is with great pleasure I nominate Mr. A.

I thank you again for what you did. By PRESIDENT LAMB: The next order of business is nomina - tions for Secretary. By MR. H. J. McLAUGHLI.V: I would like to set forth a lew reasons before I place before you Mr. Jackson's name. Now I've gone and tola you who I am going to nominate. There are a few reasons, however, for doing this. When I came down here six years ago I moved into an apartment on Sixteenth Street. A few weeks later Mr. Jackson came around and moved into the apartment directly under me. I stood that for three months and then I moved over to another place and for three months I had that alone — then he had to move in there. I was there a few months and had moved over on 1/ Street, and he moved in under me there. For five years we lived together. Now I have just left here and moved back to the farm. Now I have determined to keep Mr. Jackson here so he will not move and follow me to the farm. Then there are some more serious reasons. In the United States there is no superior secretary to Mr. Jackson — no man his equal in that 'work, as a State Fair Manager and no man the. superior of Mr. Jackson in this work. It gives me really a great deal of pleasure to seriously present in nomination Mr. George Jack - son for Secretary. Nomination seconded by a County Fair Delegate. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Motion made, that the rules be suspended and the President tuai the unanimous vote of the meeting for Mr. Jackson. Seconded. Ques - tion put to a vote and carried. ■ By PRESIDENT LAMB: It affords me very much pleasure to cast the entire vote of this convention for Mr. Jackson for Secretary. Now we want to hear from him. By SECRETARY JACKSON: I appreciate very much this having ■you continue your confidence in me and in my work, and after all is said and done that is what counts. Six years ago when I was elected to take up this work and handle this responsible position I counted it an honor, of course. But after all It isn't so much the honor, but to merit your con - fidence and be continued in the work by reason of your continued confidence. The re-election is what counts. When I leave this ofllce, men, I want to have just the same confidence as when I find myself re-elected now. If that may happen I will feel I have done my part well. I have been working on this job hard and steadily, but I have not been working alone and I couldn't do'it alone. I have been in - terested in the work and we find that we are getting results. But I want to tell you personally I would rather have this particular job than to-be Governor of Nebraska or any other state, because no man can be Governor and serve the state and build up agriculture as well as he can in this activity here. That is one thing I want to do when I do leave — when that time comes I want to leave this office with my record clean. Just so long as I serve here I want to have a clean record. As long as I serve here I will never have anything besmirch it. I want my moral record to be clean; I want you men to retain the same confidence in me that you seem to have now. That is what I am aiming to do, and when - ever the time comes that I can't be of service in this line and along that line of thought then I want to quit. I realize that this job is too big for one man if he hopes to be of much service. This is one of the biggest organizations in this state; it rests a big responsibility on us to achieve its success and prevent its failure. I want to thank you again for your continued confidence as manifested for me today.

WAYLAND W. MAGEE, Bennington, Nebraska. Members of the Association and Friends of Agriculture: In times of depression when farm prices are falling, it strikes me as doubly important that farmers pause in their day's work and take their bearings in order that they can determine the trend of the times and possibly better their financial position by making a study of the situation j as it is. -^*&lt;lBSl|^^ This message will be made short for I M am well aware of the great cost at which ( %- : i these meetings are held. If you doubt for 5aM&lt;ap£ jUg one moment that time is not valuable at these • EP ■ ;^i gatherings figure out for yourselves what it wjP"* - has cost you individually to leave your farm .TOt^ ■ and come here; then multiply that figure by MP _jifr"V the number of men who are here, and you »vHB^^^fcfc will be surprised at the cost of these meet- Hfe *™ ings. They are, however, an investment that Jb^^^^^^T^K^I: I believe is warranted. I know you men are 1^^*^ busy men and 1 want to congratulate you wayland w. magee on your forethought in planning to attend. I want to congratulate the Crop Growers on having put on such good programs in the past that there are so many of you willing to come out this early in the morning. The program we are about to have has been thought out by your officers in advance, and as in the years gone past we have split our time with the Department of Rural Economics. They are going to give you some recent developments in their field and the picture as they see it. The tax situation is on their side. We will then swlns over into the Crop Growers program proper and tell you what there Is new and of interest in our own line. Some of Our Activities My duty now is to report to you what have been the activities of your organization through the year just past. This record will be printed and mailed to our membership out over this State, and to our friends in other states. </seg>
            <seg id="p096">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE To begin with I want to state that Nebraska, from an agricul - tural standpoint, has had a very fair year when you compare our crop production with that of other large agricultural states. We have passed Illinois in corn production, and stand second to Iowa Over the country as a whole our corn crop is about 25% short of the five year average, and nationally is the smallest crop we have had since 1901 Our small grain crops have been nothing out of the ordinary, but their prices have shown a marked decline as compared to the last few years. The Outlook Meetings which were held throughout the State have brought about some adjustment In crop acreage and live - stock inventories, which I take it is a definitely encouraging sign Beyond question it behooves us as crop growers to give more thought •n, °?k P ! anting and Panning program. Other causes have entered into the farm program but it is the speeding up of the farm and the attending over-production which is at the bottom of most of our troubles. This story has been well shot at us out of that double^ barreled shot gun, the Federal Farm Board— I say "double-barreled" because there are two programs of activity. They have a long and short program of farm activity. With their long time program of setting up farmer owned and farmer controlled machinery for mer - chandising our product they have shown some speed. Organized now and operat ng in every state where grain is grown the first of the nations .sales agencies handled before it was four months old about fifty mill on bushels of grain. Of this fifty million bushels of grain l» ~L ? "? Ir annual re P° rt that m°re than forty million bushels was wheat, about one-fifth of which-was sold for export into eight oreign countries.

We participated actively in the utility grain shows at Lincoln. You will find .on tables in the other room 180 samples of corn as' it has come from the fields of the participants in Ten-Acre Corn Yield Contests. These samples were gathered at the time the yield was being determined, Bhipped into the College to be dried and their shelling percent taken. They have now been judged from the stand - point of market corn. If you will study them you will learn what class of corn is in demand at the terminal markets and what corn samples command a premium. The trophy in this class is the donation of "The Nebraska Farmer," grateful acknowledgement for which is made at this time. Should you be interested in bettering your yields of small grain with no appreciable advance in costs, look over the Utility Small Grain Show. For the sake of old times and so that we can learn by our folly, we have continued the 10-Ear Corn Show largely for conversational purposes and because we hate to part with an old friend. </seg>

Yet we do not want to have this new found and very elastic aid to our transportation problem destroyed by an exces - size taxing of large trucks as has been done in some states. It has been said that taxes are like the poor — personally I think we have lots of poor taxes, and trust our membership who have a turn of mind for rural economics will devote some time to a study of our tax problem, for surely the farmer is carrying more than his fair share of the load. It is proper and- fitting that we should note at this time the pass - ing of one of our outstanding members who has for many years been exceptionally active and helpful in the councils of this Society — Mr. Charles Grau of Bennington, Nebraska, died December 15, 1930. In his loss we mourn not only a co-worker but a true friend. Weeds and Weed Laws As In the past your officers and members have interested them - selves in the problems of noxious weeds, and through the activity and co-operation of the Society have been able to aid the Seed Analyst. Miss Norris, in the distribution of dodder circulars throughout the State. We have also, in order to aid the Seed Department, diagnosed the weed situation in Nebraska, made a farmer's study of the presence of noxious weeds as to localities and prevalence, a summary of which has brought forcibly to the attention of your board of presidents the necessity for drastic action in the eradication of bind weed or the small flowered morning glory. In the dissemination of Information your Secretary, Mr. P. H. Stewart, has been very effective in prepar - ing for the American Bankers Association, information which has been published in their bulletins issued by the Agricultural Commission of that association, where the better seed program has been forcibly brought home to many influential men in their several communities. Your Committee on Reorganization has prepared and will present to the proper business meeting a new constitution and by-laws, under the terms of which it is hoped the activities of this Society may be continued and conserved through the years to come. Through our policy In self-imposed tax on seed sales, and the generosity of the State Board of Agriculture, we have been able to finance ourselves with no serious financial difficulties; In fact, as I have stated before at these meetings, we finish the year with money In both pockets. We know that there Is plenty of sub-soil moisture in Nebraska, and while agriculture Is passing through a hard period, we have faith to carry on. </seg>

"Some Items such as local fees and fines, inheritance tax, and others of minor Import - ance are not included because figures were not available. It is readily apparent that by far the greater part of the tax funds are secured from the general property tax. The table Is not entirely accurate as there are several minor sources of revenue that are omitted. Revenue secur.ed by cities and towns from fees of various kinds and from fines is not included. Revenue secured by the state from such sources as inspection fees of various kinds are also omitted. There may also be other minor sources of revenue omitted, but they are not of any great consequence. In 1929, the general property tax provided slightly less than the 75.4 per cent of all revenue of the state and its subdivisions, as given in the table, if allowance is made for the minor sources I have not included in the table. Second in Importance is the gasoline tax, which provided about 9.9 per cent of the revenue in 1929. It Is expended for a specific purpose — building and maintenance of highways. The gasoline consumed by motor vehicles is a reasonably equitable meas - ure of their use of highways, so that in principle there is little objec - tion to it as a source of revenue. Then there' are the taxes on the two classes of intangibles, A and B, which together provided about one and one-half million of tax money in 1929, or about 2.2 per cent of the total revenue. In essence, these taxes are a modification of the general property tax. Because of the ease of hiding Intangible property from the assessor, special </seg>

The first five items are distinctly agricultural .and amount to about 64 per cent of the total. In addition, farmers were owners of a goodly proportion of the automobiles and trucks, and the household goods. In all it would seem that fully two-thirds of the general property tax is paid by farmers and other farm owners. The 1920 federal census reported that 45.1 of the population lived on farms. In a recent issue of the "Nebraska Farmer" Pro - fessor Fllley made the estimate that not more than forty or forty-one per cent of the people of Nebraska are now actually living on farms. Based on numbers alone, two-fifths of the state's population -were pay - ing two-thirds of the general property tax in 1929. It is a premise established by tax experts that income is a fair measure of ability to pay taxes. Do Nebraska farmers obtain two-thirds of the income secured by the state's population? One of the speakers who follow me will probably enlarge on this obvious defect of the general property </seg>
            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tax, as it relates to the ability of Nebraska farmers to pay taxes as compared with other classes of the state's population. Approximately ten per cent of the taxable assessed valuations include the property of such public utilities as railroads, telegraph and telephone companies. The rates such public utilities charge for their services are regulated by governmental agencies and taxes ar» taken into account as an expense so are included in the service charges That being so, taxes are largely passed on to users of the services. The gasoline tax and some of the other sources of revenue which supplement the general property tax to the extent of about 20 per cent of the total revenue are proportioned among the tax payers in a more equitable manner than the general property tax. Because of that fact and their relative unimportance as compared with the general property tax, I will not take the time to discuss them. Instead, I will turn the discussion to the speaker who followi. DEFECTS OP THE GENERAL PROPERTY TAX E. GLENN CALLEN, Nebraska Wesleyan University There is an old adage in public finance to the effect that an old tax is always a good tax while a new tax is always a bad tax The general property tax is one of our oldest taxes. But is it a good tax or a bad tax? According to the topic assigned me for discussion T am to show that the general property tax, if not a bad tax, at least has its defects. All books and studies in public finance deal to some extent with the general property tax. In the various studies on public finance one finds a common characteristic of the treatment of the general property tax, namely— the enumeration of its defects. Without doubt this list of defects is the most outstanding characteristic of current discussion on the general property tax. Perhaps the adage cited above as applied to the general property tax, has caused us to tolerate this tax because of its age even though it is no longer regarded as a good tax. The general property tax is an old tax and has been used by many different countries at many different stages of civilization. However, with the exception of the extensive use made of this tax in the state and local governments in the United States, it has largely been super - seded by other types of taxes. But in the United States both the states and the subdivisions of the states still rely upon the general property tax as a major source of revenue. This situation is true in our own state where a substantial proportion of the revenue of the state and an even larger part of local revenues are derived from this </seg>
            <seg id="p109"/>
            <seg id="p110">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION tax. Of course we have seen a tendency in state taxation to use special taxes for special purposes, as in the case of the gasoline tax and the use of certain specific sources of income for education. Yet it is to be noted that at the present time the special taxes for these purposes seem inadequate and that certain proposals are being con - sidered for taking money raised by the general property tax and using it on the highways and for the equalization of educational opportunity. Defects of Property Tax Thus the general property tax is the heart of the tax system of Nebraska and many other states for both state and local purposes. Since this tax is such an important part of our entire tax system, and since it is so universally condemned by students of public finance, It is proper to consider the defects commonly charged against this tax. In presenting the defects of this tax I make no claim of originality. I have merely compiled the material presented by the authorities on taxation. The situation with reference to the criticism of the general property tax is well stated in a recent report by the National Industrial conference board which points out, "The general property tax, the historical mainstay of state and local revenue in the United States, is put to a severe strain by modern conditions. Originating at a time when property had simple and readily discoverable forms and when rates of such taxation were relatively low, this tax is applied today in an industrial society in which property assume varied and often easily concealed forms, and the increasing demands for government expenditure' bring tax rates to uncomfortable heights.". In its broadest aspects, the general property tax is a failure from the three fundamental standpoints of history, theory and practice. As lias been Indicated the general property tax Is one of the oldest taxes. In a period when agricultural pursuits were the only occupations and all property was similar the general property tax seems to have been adequate. But with the coming of a more complex system of production and a great variety of types of property the general property tax proved so defective that it was abolished as a principle source of revenue in every country except the United States. Even new and improved methods of administration could not save the general prop - erty tax as the corner stone of the revenue system. As Selegman says, "America Is today the only great nation deaf to the warnings of history." In the second place the general property tax is defective in its underlying theory. Lutz points out that the two propositions upon which the general property tax Is founded are as follows: 1. "Every citizen sh'ould contribute to the support of the government In propor - tion to his ability; 2. Property In general as viewed as a homogeneous mass, is a universally adequate measure of ability to pay taxes." It is with respect to the second of these propositions that the chief ob- </seg>
            <seg id="p111"/>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lections are found. In a simpler organization of society there may have been some truth in the assumption that the ownership of prop - erty was a measure of ability to pay taxes, although there is some evidence to indicate that this phase of the theory was attacked at a very early date. Certainly this proposition is unsound in the present stage of economic development, with its many types of property. Equal ownership of property does not insure equal ability to pay taxes. As Selegman expresses it, "Two equal masses of property may be un - equally productive, and hence unequally affect the margin of income from which the public contributions are paid. The standard of ability has been shifted from the property to product; the test of ability is not the extent, but the productivity, of wealth. And since revenue is a better index than wealth, the vast class of earnings derived not from property but from exertion is completely and unjustifiably ex - empted by the taxation of property alone. The theory of the property tax again fails because the conditions of the theory have disappeared." Not only is the failure of the general property tax illustrated in • its historical and theoretical aspects but also by the defects in its practical applications. And as we regard ourselves as practical people we are primarily concerned in the concrete defects of the general property tax as it is applied to every-day situations. Of the many • practical defects of the general property tax some five are predomin - ant. These defects are: the lack of uniformity in the assessment of property, the possibilities of double taxation, the tendency for the gen - eral property tax to become regressive, the incentive to dishonesty, and finally the failure of the general property tax to reach all prop - erty. Before considering each of these defects in detail it might be well to note that in many instances the general property tax has been replaced by modified property taxes so that some of the worst phases of the abuses have been eliminated. But the general property tax is still applied to such a large extent that its defects continue to impos« an undue hardship upon the taxpayers. Property Assessments Not Uniform The first defect, that of lack of uniformity in the assessment on valuation. Is very frequently found. Two causes partially account for this practice. In the first place the local assessors do not have, and cannot have under the salaries paid them and the methods used in their selection, the necessary experience, training and equipment to enable them to assess all property in a fair and accurate manner. In the second place each assessor and each reviewing agency is a party to a system of competitive undervaluation as a means of reducing the proportion of the taxes paid by their community. The tendency 1b for the practice to increase, for the more the rate is increased the greater is the temptation to attempt to evade tax increases by greater underassessment. In an effort to remedy this abuse the states have created boards of equalization to adjust such differences in valua- </seg>
            <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION. tion. But it is doubtful if such boards correct this abuse as these boards are frequently of an ex-offlcio nature, the members giving most of their time and attention to other matters. Moreover, as these boards are generally made up of political officers there are limits beyond which it is not wise for them to go. The- possibility and likelihood of double taxation is another defect of the general property tax system. Such possibilities arise out of the fact that the general property tax attempts to tax all property in all its forms. ■ Thus the tax applies to physical property and to the intangible property in the form of stocks and bonds which have value only because they represent physical property and which has already been taxed. This particular defect is riot so serious in Nebraska be - cause of the use of various forms of modified property tax as applied to intangibles. A further defect of the general property tax is its tendency for it to become regressive. This means that on the units of property of largest value the actual rate paid in taxes is less than on the units of property of smaller value. Thus the larger units of property value do not pay their fair share of taxes. This tendency is due to the fact that the general property tax falls most heavily upon real estate. Professor Selegman summarizes this practice as follows: "The general property tax in its practical effect is often regressive, since the tax on personalty is levied virtually on those who already stand on the assessor's books as liable to the tax on realty. Those who own no real estate are in most cases not taxed at all; those who possess realty bear the taxes for both. The weight of taxation really rests on the farmer, because in the rural districts the assessors add the personalty, which is generally visible and tangible, to the realty, and impose the tax on both. We hear. a great deal about the decline of farming lands. But one of its chief causes has been singularly overlooked. It is the overburdening of the agriculturist by the gen - eral property tax. What is practically a real property tax in the remainder of the state becomes a general property tax in the rural regions. The farmer bears not only his share, but also that of the other classes of society." Professor Selegman then quotes the tax commissioners of several states to the effect that the property which pays the least taxes pays the largest dividends, and that the property of the smalt property owner is as a rule valued by a far higher stand - ard than is the property of his rich neighbor. Dishonesty a Factor A fourth defect of the general property tax is its incentive to dishonesty. This dishonesty may find expression in the use of tax exempt property at assessment times or the establishment of a tax colony to enable the taxpayer to take advantage of low tax rates. These forms of dishonesty are some of the methods of taking ad- </seg>
            <seg id="p114">BEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE vantage of the law and of violating Its spirit If not its' letter. The more direct form of dishonesty practiced in connection with the gen - eral property tax is in connection with self-assessment and the dis - closure of property. Some states have attempted to discourage dis - honesty in this connection by providing for the assessment of property at less than full value. Such laws, however, are of doubtful value as the taxpayer soon learns that the decreased value is offset by an increase in the tax rate. As you will recall Nebraska abandoned the plan of one-fifth valuation in 1921. The extent to which dishonesty has developed in the assessment of the general property tax is indicated by statements of state tax commissioners who say that people deter - mine the amount they will pay in taxes much as they determine their contribution to church, or 9unday school, that is not by what they Bhould pay but what they wish to pay. In this respect the general property tax has been characterized as a tax on honesty and ignorance, that is on honesty for telling the truth and on ignorance for noi knowing any better than to tell the truth. Of course one cannot justify dishonesty on the grounds that every - one resorts to this practice. However, the truth of what Lutz says must be considered. He says: "We recognize that the highest dictates of morality offer no justification for violating the law and the com - mitting of perjury, but we insist also that there is no defense for a tax system which inflicts penalties so severe as to subject taxpayers to an irresistible temptation to evade." Not only has the general property tax affected the moral attitude of the people toward tax laws but toward other laws. Moreover, the fact that people are not making correct tax returns under the general property tax leads them to think that they are saving money because they evade the- law. They do not realize that others are doing the same thing so that the net result is merely the payment of higher rates on a lower valuation. This .feeling on the part of the people generally is very deep seated and according to Hunter is one of the reasons that it is so difficult to reform or abolish the general property tax. People think they are getting something for nothing under this practice when such is not the case. Property Escapes Taxation A final defect charged against the general property tax is its lack of universality or its failure to reach all property. As indicated above the taxpayer frequently fails to list all of his property. He pays taxes only on the property which the assessor is able to discover. If an equal percent of the property of all escaped taxation the situation would not be so serious. But only certain types of property escape assessment, such as personal property and especially intangibles. As Selegman points out, "The taxation of personal property is in Inverse ratio to its quantity; the more it increases, the less it pays. The </seg>
            <seg id="p115">NEBRASKA CHOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION reason is plain. So far as it is intangible, personal property escapes the scrutiny of the most vigilant assessor; so far as it is tangible, it is purposely exempted in its chief form, as stock in trade, in our com - mercial centers. In the mad race for wealth it is considered danger - ous for the local assessors in large cities to -list the merchant's capital, with the possible result of driving it away to localities more favored by their financial officers." Thus the man with the property which is visable pays the taxes without regard to the total amount of his property or his ability to pay. I have attempted to analyze and summarize some of the outstand - ing abuses of the general property tax in its present day administra - tion. No doubt many other defects could be charged against the system. The system calls for far-reaching reforms. I understand that the next speaker will consider some essentials of reforms. I assure you he has a most difficult task, for as Selegman says, "The general. property tax as actually administered today is be - yond all preadventure the worst tax known in the civilized world." To this Plehn adds, "This is strong language — even stronger has been used." REQUISITES OF A GOOD SYSTEM OK TAXATION H. CLYDE FI1.LEY Nebraska Agricultural College A good tax system must be good from the standpoint of adminis - tration and also from the standpoint of the distribution of the tax burden. It would be possible to plan a system that would be easy to administer but which would t&gt;e very unfair to a portion of the tax - payers. It would also be possible to make a tax system so complex in an endeavor to distribute the tax burden equably that it would be unsatisfactory from the standpoint of the men charged with the ad - ministration of the law. Administration In order to be administratively successful a tax system should possess the following qualities or characteristics: 1. It must be productive. No tax system can be con - sidered satisfactory unless it provides enough revenue for the needs of the state. 2. The system should be flexible enough to permit the fiscal authorities to adjust the revenues to changing needs. 3. The taxes that make up the system should be de - pendable. It should be possible to forecast the revenues that will be obtained in any year with some degree of certainty. </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 4. Every tax ought to be economical. The costs of as - sessment and collection ought to consume only a small part of the revenue that a tax yields. A tax ought not to be im - posed in such a manner that the taxpayers are greatly in - convenienced or put to considerable expense to comply with the rules and regulations governing its payment. Distribution of the Tax Burden A major part of the students of taxation agree that taxes should be paid in accordance with ability to pay, but upon the criteria that shall be selected to determine ability there is a wide difference of opinion. Adam Smith, whose canons of taxation have been quoted for more than 150 years, states that "The subjects of every state ought to contribute toward the support of the government, as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in pro - portion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the pro - tection of the state." Smith believed that ability to pay was directly proportional to income. If "A" had twice as much income as "B", he was able to pay twice as much tax. Some men, particularly wealthy men, continue to hold to this ideal of proportional taxation. In opposition to the idea that taxes should be directly propor - tional to income it is urged that a certain amount of income is essential for the purchase of the bare necessities of life. The payment of even a small sum for taxes is therefore a burden to the person whose income is very small. Because of this, all laws which lay a tax upon income provide that a small amount shall be exempt. The amount is usually larger for a married man than for a. single man, and an additional exemption is usually provided for each dependent. Exempting a small amount from an income. tax, as for example, $600 for single men, $1,200 for married men, and $200 for each child under 18, results in exempting a large number of families from the payment of an income tax, because their total income is less than the amount of the exemptions. This decreases the cost of tax collecting, because the expense to a poor man of making out an income tax state - ment, and the expense to the government of caring for the payment would often be greater than the amount of the tax. From the point of view of administration as well as from the point of view of dis - tributing the tax burden properly, the very small Income should not be taxed. Progressive versus . Proportional Taxes Income tax laws which have been passed in recent years not only provide exemptions, but are progressive — that is, the rate of the tax increases as the amount of the taxable income grows larger. The Federal Income Tax is a progressive tax which provides very liberal exemptions. The rates have been as follows since 1928: </seg>
            <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION EXEMPTIONS: 1. Married person, head of a family, or husband [ or wife _ , . _....$3,500 2. Single person 1,500 3. For each minor child or other dependent.... _ _ 400 4. Dividends from corporations subject to the in - come tax NORMAL, RATES: 1. First $4,000 of net income above exemptions... ...1 % % 2. .Next $4,000 of net income above exemptions 3% 3. Remainder of net income above exemptions 5 r /r SURTAX: Income over $10,000 to $14,000 _ _1% Income over $14,000 to $16,000 _... 2% The Increase is regular up to $24,000 where the surtax is 6 per cent on the amount of the income between $22,000 and $24,000. For incomes above the latter figure the rate rises by varying intervals to 20 per cent on all incomes in excess of $100,000. One of the arguments advanced in favor of progressive taxation is that ability to pay increases progressively rather than proportion - ately. If "A" has a taxable income of $4,000 and "B" has a taxable income of $2,000, "A" would be better able to pay a tax of $400 or 10 per cent than ."B" would be to pay a tax of $100 or 5 per cent. After paying the larger tax "A" woulcLbe able to provide more present comforts for his family and lay aside a greater amount to care for their future needs. Opponents of the progressive principle urge that it is impossible to ascertain at what rate the tax should be increased in order that the sacrifice made by the .wealthy man shall be just equal to the sacrifice made by the poor man. In fact after listening to some of the arguments presented by wealthy tax dodgers against the levying of any income tax one is almost constrained to believe that these persons would suffer greater pain if they were compelled to pay one per cent of their incomes as taxes than landowners suffer who are accustomed to paying 25 or 30 per cent of their incomes. A second argument urged in favor of a limited amount of pro - gression is the fact that most import duties and internal revenue taxes bear more heavily on small incomes than on large incomes, because the person with only a small income must spend a much larger pro - portion of his income for taxed commodities than a person with a large income. A third argument in favor of the income tax being progressive instead of proportional is that large fortunes are frequently acquired at the expense of the public, and a progressive tax permits the recap - ture of a portion of the wealth that has been unjustly obtained. Op - ponents of the progressive principle urge that it is impossible to de- </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lermine which large Incomes were secured unfairly, and that It Is Impossible to tax any large incomes without taxing all. A state is not justified in attacking all wealth until it has abundant evidence that most of the wealth was acquired by unsocial methods. Not only the Federal government but various state governments have applied the progressive principle to income taxes, and there is no reason to believe that the idea will become less popular. It will probably retain its position for the following reasons: 1. The theory of equality of sacrifice, which has already been discussed. 2. It is more productive than any proportional tax that is politically feasible. 3. Import and excise taxes bear most heavily on small Incomes. 4. Taxing large incomes heavily and small incomes light - ly aids In the more equal distribution of the national wealth. i/uxury Taxes It is quite generally conceded that the necessities of life should not be taxed. A direct tax on bread or salt or windows would not be a popular tax because we consider these things as essential. A general sales tax, either retail or wholesale, is not usually considered a just tax because it taxes the poor much more heavily than the wealthy. The poor man must spend all his income; the wealthy man can live luxuriously upon only a part of his annual returns. It is ad - mitted, however, that in actual practice we do levy an Indirect tax upon many of the necessaries of life, and tax some of them very heavily. In this list are included sugar, cotton, and woolen goods, leather, shoes, steel, glass, and china. We may, however, tax luxuries, because the person who can pur - chase luxuries is certainly able to contribute to the support of the government. It Is also a well known fact that people often pay for luxuries more freely and more willingly than they pay for necessities. Among the luxuries which are taxed by the Federal government are tobacco, furs, silks, and diamonds. Taxes In Proportion to Benefits Received When a government wishes to secure money to be expended for some purpose which will be of specific benefit to some particular group of people, it often attempts to levy a tax the Incidence of which will bear some relationship to the benefits received. All local im - provement taxes are of this type, as is also the gasoline tax. Hunting and fishing license fees and many other government receipts which bear a more or less, exact relationship to the benefit </seg>
            <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION derived are of this general type. These fees which are primarily paid for performing some service should not be considered as taxes even though they often do result in relieving the tax burden to a limited extent. Taxes That Should Form a Part of a Good Tax System It is not only important to know the administrative essentials of a good tax system and the best distribution of the burden of taxation, but it is likewise important to know the kinds of taxes which will best fit the essential requirements. In other words, it would be almost useless to discuss the requisites of a good tax system unless It were possible to suggest taxes to fit the condition specified. An Income Tax Mention has already been made of income taxes in discussing progressive and proportional taxation. A progressive Income tax meets the various conditions specified better than any other one tax, but not better than a combination of several taxes. An income tax is productive. England, France, Germany, and various other European countries have for many years secured a con - siderable portion . of their revenues from a progressive income tax. This fine field of wheat may or may nut make a profit. • More of our taxes should be levied on an Income basts. The United States has had an income tax since 1910. The proceeds were not large until after our entry into the World War. From 1918 until the present time, more than one-half of the ordinary receipts of the Federal government have been secured from a tax on Incomes. Many states are now securing a considerable part of their revenue from a tax on Incomes. These states include Wisconsin, New York, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Missouri. </seg>
            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 11 has been demonstrated that an income tax can be made to yield. It cannot be made to yield as large a portion of the revenue needed by the states as. it yields of the national revenue, because not all states have an income tax. A very high income tax in any state would result in the transfer of the legal residence of very wealthy citizens to states that had no income tax or only a very low tax. If Nebraska, for example, should enact a law placing a very high tax upon incomes, and if Iowa should not, it is very likely that the popula - tion and wealth of Council Bluffs would be Increased at the expense of Omaha. What we really need is a change in the national law, so that the Federal government would tax much smaller incomes than are now taxed, and tax all Incomes at a somewhat higher rate, and providing further that the Federal government would not collect any of the tax on small incomes nor a specified portion of the tax on large incomes in states where the state collected an income tax of not less than the amount. specified. Such a law would be followed rather quickly by the enactment of somewhat uniform income tax laws in all the states. An income tax, when the rate is fixed by the legislature is not flexible, but when a part of the revenue is produced in other ways it can form an important part of a flexible system. For example, in Nebraska the tax on tangible property could be' used merely to cover appropriations not cared for by the income tax and other sources of income. The income tax is fairly dependable even though somewhat variable. Even in such an unfavorable year as 1930, the states with an income tax will receive very material receipts from persons whose incomes are large enough to be taxable. The taxes from those who are admittedly able to pay reduces the amounts to be secured from property, a part of which returns either no net income or a very low income. The cost of collecting the Income tax has been relatively low. The advantages of a progressive income tax over a proportional income tax have already been mentioned. In discussing an income tax, the progressive form is usually understood unless the propor - tional tax is specifically mentioned. Income tax laws usually distinguish between earned and unearned income. Earned incomes are the result of labor or of active business management. Unearned incomes are derived from the ownership of property. Earned incomes are ordinarily taxed at a lower rate than unearned incomes. Under the Federal law, if the Income is earned, the taxpayer is allowed to deduct 25 per cent of the amount of the tax due on any amount of income up to $30,000. The first $5,000 of income is assumed to be earned in all cases. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION A Tav on Cigarettes The Federal government secures considerable revenues from a tax on tobacco In its various forms. Kansas and several other states have experimented very successfully with a tax on cigarettes. Cigar - ettes are a luxury and the people who use them can well afford to pay an increased portion of the cost of government. Cosmetics The factory value o[ the perfumery, cosmetics, and toilet prepara - tions manufactured in the United States is in excess of $130,000,000 per year. The price paid by consumers is much greater than the fac - tory value and undoubtedly exceeds $200,000,000 per year. Cosmetics and perfume are luxuries and should bear a luxury tax. It is impos - sible to state the value of such products consumed in Nebraska, but from surface Indications it is apparently large. A tax of 10 per cent on the retail sales value of this class of products would undoubtedly yield considerable- revenue. A stamp tax would be a simple means of collecting the revenue. Admissions and Dues A tax levied on admissions to entertainments and on dues paid to clubs and other organizations is another phase of the luxury tax. Such a tax is sometimes called a nuisance tax. It is a nuisance to have to pay such a tax, but its payment brings home the cost of govern - ment to many persons whose direct contributions to the cost of gov - ernment" are small. It is well for everyone to realize that govern - mental activities cost money. The Gasoline Tax The gasoline tax is fundamentally fair, because it. places a part of the cost of the improved roads upon the people who use the roads. Because improved roads facilitate transportation, Nebraska auto owners can pay the tax and save money. Very unfortunately the law In its present form places a part of the cost of road improvement upon persons who use gasoline for other purposes than highway transportation. There is no perceptible con - nection between the operation of a farm tractor or a stationary gaso - line engine and the use of the highways. The administration of the gasoline tax law would unquestionably be more difficult if the gasoline used for purposes other than highway transportation were exempted from the tax, yet because of the present inequality an exemption should be made if it is legally possible. A Gross Earnings Tax Upon Railroads The railroads serve the people of the state as a whole and not merely the people who live .close to the railway lines. The railway </seg>
            <seg id="p122">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE freight and passenger terminals are necessary to the operation of the roads, because through them flows the traffic generated on the branch lines and the lines that reach to other terminals. Without connecting lines, the terminal property would be valueless for transportation purposes. Under our present system of taxation, the school district or other local subdivision through which a part of the railway passes is able to obtain a part of. its revenue from the tax levied on "the railway property, although It may contribute no more to the upbuilding of the railway than an adjoining district that receives no part of the railway tax money. The terminal property is taxed where it is located, although the terminal is necessitated by the traffic that is generated in other places. A tax levied by the state on the gross income of the railroads and used in part for paying the cost of state government and in part dis - tributed to the schools of the state at the same time and in the same way that other state school funds are now apportioned would give a much more equable distribution of the tax burden. A tax on the gross income of railways is a tax that is easily and cheaply administered. In Nebraska in recent years there has been almost continual disagree - ment over the values at which the railway lines should be assessed. The state has expended considerable money in fighting these railway tax cases in the courts. A gross income tax would end such litigation because the value of the railroads would no longer enter into con - sideration. Such a law Is now in force in Minnesota. The Tax on Tangible Property Even if we had a progressive tax on personal incomes, a tax on the gross income of railways and tax on various luxuries, it would yet be necessary to secure a considerable part of our public revenues from the antiquated and discredited tax on tangible property. Pro - fessor Callen has pointed out the many defects of this tax. If it must be used we should have equality of assessment which is something that we do not have at the present time. In other words, we should improve the old tax system as well as providing for new taxes. State Control of Taxation We have abundant evidence that the system of precinct assessors and of county assessors who work independently do not give us uni - form assessment. This is not a criticism of the men who do the assess - ing but of the plan under which they work. One of the defects of the property tax is the impossibility of securing absolute equality of assessment. If the assessing power were centralized, it would be pos^ sible to secure a much more nearly uniform assessment of property than we have at the present time. </seg>
            <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Some states have a state tax commission or tax board which is in charge of all matters of assessment and tax collecting. Upon the whole such boards are an improvement over our present system. They provide a better administration of tax matters and a more equable distribution of the tax burden. The administration of such taxes as a state tax on personal in - comes, a tax on the gross incomes of railroads, and luxury taxes, must bo centralized. It is therefore very evident that one of the requisites of a good system of taxation is the creation of a state tax board or state tax commission. Conclusion Taxation is a matter of interest to everyone, it is- of interest to the persons who now bear the main share of the tax burden, and also to the persons who would be called upon to pay Increased taxes under a more equable tax system than we have at present. It is likewise of interest to everyone who has children of school age, and to everyone who is interested in law enforcement. Our present tax system is not satisfactory. It does not distribute the tax burden equably, and the administrative machinery Is not adequate. The ideal tax system has not yet been evolved. Some states have made much greater progress than has Nebraska, and we should profit by their example. In this, paper I have attempted to present some of the things that students of taxation believe are requisite to a good system of taxation. It is not maintained that the discussion is either complete or final. It does indicate the line of progress, and the most of us who are tax payers realize that there is room for progress and that now is a proper time for action. MR. H. R. SMITH, Lincoln Live Stock Commissioner of the National Live .Stock Exchange. I believe it is generally agreed throughout the country as a whole that land taxes are now becoming too much of a burden. In recent times, manufacturing has developed to large proportions. We have now a great volume of stocks, bonds and other securities. Land today represents a very much smaller part of the total wealth of the nation than formerly. Certainly these securities should be taxed because they are productive of revenue. It seems to me that all taxation should be based on productivity. The national income taxes have been very fair and state income taxes are equally just. If we do reduce the taxes on land, I would like to see the home exempt up to a certain valuation because it is not for profit. I refer to the home occupied by the owner and his family — not a rented house. </seg>

            <seg id="p126">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION CAN YOU PREDICT THE "WEATHER? W. B. BANCROFT, College of Agriculture, Lincoln. "Can you predict the weather"? Certainly you may. The pertin - ent question is, "Will your prediction come true"? The U. S. weather bureau's forecasts are possible because the telegraph is swifter than the wind. Twice daily, at 7:00 o'clpck each morning and each evening, trained weather bureau observers at more than 200 stations read the thermometers and record the highest and lowest temperatures for the preceding twelve hours and the temperature at the time of observa - tion, the barometer recording the pressure of the air, the wind direc - tion and intensity, whether or not there was rain or snow during the preceding day, and the degree of cloudiness. These observations are reported immediately by wire to 65 forecasting stations. There are four reporting stations in Nebraska, Lincoln, Omaha, Valentine and North Platte. At the first two stations named weather maps are drawn and forecasts made. The weather map is the interesting thing and reveals the condi - tions from which the prediction is made. The forecaster has an out - line map of the United States spread on the table before him and as the telegrams from observers are read to him he jots the items down upon the map. This done he has before him the weather conditions of the country as they were less than an hour before and it is for him to say what the conditions probably will be during the next 36 hours. How does the weather change? Is there any observable move - ment of weather conditions across the country? In answering this question we shall find the. weather is largely a product of the wind. While we have all felt the chill sometimes present in the "north end" of a south wind and we enjoyed the balmy air of last Sunday although the wind was in the northwest, yet as a rule northerly winds are cool and southerly winds are warm. The forecaster wants to know how the wind is going to blow tomorrow. Highs and Lows Caused chiefly by the rotation of the earth and the great heat of the sun in the tropics we find in the temperate zones great rivers of air' flowing from the west to the east at a rate of about 35 miles an hour. Were it not for "complications" we would have in Nebraska a stiff west wind blowing all the time. This movement of the air is sometimes observable in the motion of the highest clouds. At the surface of the earth we find this stream of eastward movement filled by great whirlpools of air drifting along in the stream. These whirl - pools vary greatly in extent but are usually hundreds of miles in diameter, of oval or Irregular shape. In the center of the whirlpool </seg>

Rain from this cause most often occurs in the southwest quarter of a low or storm center. You see, rain making is quite simple. All you need is enough • ingredients mixed right. Lows pass over Nebraska at the rate of about one every four days. Most of them go over us without rain because there is not moisture enough drawn in with the air at the base of the low. There are parts of our country where nearly every low yields a shower. Warm, dry air will eagerly pick up water from a land surface, as witness, the clothes line any wash day, and the rolling of corn leaves in a dry spell, but to get moisture enough for much rain air must be brought into contact with ocean surfaces. The eastward moving river of air comes off from the Pacific Ocean plentifully sup - plied with water but by the time it has climbed over three chains of mountains it has dropped its load, and become as dry as a comic strip. Fortunately for Nebraska the Ozark Mountains are well worn down and there is no fence between us and the Gulf of Mexico and the moisture laden air from the southern shore is caught and swung north - ward by succeeding lows and high like the lady in the Virginia reel until a coolness arises that yields for us the blessed rain. The Weather Tomorrow Why do weather predictions fail? The general principles of weather predictions are very simple. The specific application, not so rq,uch so. For fifty years the weather bureau has been measuring and platting the track of every low and high that has crossed the country. We know that the most used track for the center of a low is to come in from the ocean in the region of Puget Sound, move southeastward to a point in Missouri then turn slightly to the north of east and pass, over Lake Erie and down the St. Lawrence Valley. We can tell with an 85% accuracy how a low is going to behave and what the weather in consequence will be, but there are 15% .of them that act in the strangest sort of way like the unruly sheep in the flock. The weather forecaster sometimes is confronted by a map that yields an apparently certain prediction. Another time his choice may lie nearly fifty-flfty between two possible resolutions of present weather conditions. The forecaster, however, is required to make his prediction definite and cannot express his degree of certainty. Here is where a slight knowl - edge of the meaning of a weather map is a real satisfaction. You read the prediction as printed then turning to the weather map, make your own prediction and estimate the possible changes and the degree of certainty lying back of the official forecast. Forecasting the weather for a longer period in advance than it takes for a low to drift from the Pacific coast to Nebraska has not been as yet developed to any degree of scientific accuracy. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION E. It. CHASE: You said in mentioning the direction of the wimi that it moved as the hands of a clock. Now,, it makes a difference how the clock is placed. What do you mean? MR. BANCROFT: The air down in the tropics, rising at the equator, circling over and descending near the Tropic of Cancer moves as the hands. of a clock hanging on the west wall as you look at It from the east. But. here, speaking of the clockwise, spiral motion of surface winds on Nebraska prairies, we think of the clock as resting on its back upon the table. The clockwise motion of wind spirally outward from a "high" is from north to east. The counter-clockwise movement of the wind spirally inward toward a "low" is from the north toward the west. MR. REAM: Where does the wind come from as it pours out from the center of a "high"? Where does it go to as it blows into a low? MR. BANCROFT: In the center of a "low" the air is moving upward with rapidity and volume enough to take care of all that blows in. In the center of a "high" the air is coming down from the upper regions. This upward and downward motion of the air is not notice - able to our senses and we say there is a calm in these centers. MR. GRUVER: You spoke of predictions for Nebraska weather being made in Chicago. You also spoke of Mr. Blair making predic - tions at the Lincoln office. Why two stations? MR. BANCROFT: The Chicago station makes predictions for Nebraska as a whole and for surrounding states. Mr. Blair makes the prediction headed, "For Lincoln and Vicinity". Weather condi - tions may be quite different in Omaha, Fremont or Falls City, from Lincoln. SMALL NEBRASKA FAKMEHS USE COMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS . J. C. RUSSEL Department of Agronomy, University of Nebraska. (Abstract of a talk illustrated with lantern slides.) In statistical tables, Nebraska has always been listed along with the Dakotas, and most of the western states as consuming only a few hundred tons of commercial fertilizer, usually about 500 tons per annum. Kansas to the south, and Iowa to the east each are listed as consuming about ten times as much, and Missouri about 100 times as much. Actually, there have been years not very long ago when </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the total annual consumption In Nebraska of strictly chemical fertiliz - ers did not exceed 10 tons. In very recent years, the consumption of fertilizers In Nebraska has shown a decided Increase. The estimate for 1930 is 1,000 tons. This increase consists in part of various brands of lawn fertilizer that are becoming increasingly popular in cities and towns, and in part of sodium nitrate and ammonium sulphate for orchards, but mainly of phosphates that are being used on sugar beets. ih. s^elW 1 vsuSfi^^Aaw '\ss &gt; &amp; l &amp;&amp;p** from oain _ 489 bus;u . ls per ac e The first Impetus to the using of fertilizer came In 1925 when the U.

Department of Agriculture, Office of Soil Fertility, working with the American Beet Sugar Company at Grand Island got large Increases from phosphate on unirrigated beets in the Grand Island territory. A second impetus came in 1927-28 when the Great Western Sugar Company found that even larger increases could be obtained on Irrigated sugar beets in the North Platte Valley. The third and most recent Impetus is the discovery, largely during the past season, that other crops than beets likewise respond amazingly to phosphate under certain soil conditions.

It was applied with combination fertilizer-grain drills. In eastern Nebraska entirely different results were obtained. This was partly on account of the extreme shortage of rainfall, last season, however, the striking responses from phosphate obtained in western Nebraska are not expected under, the entirely different soil conditions that are obtained in the central and eastern portions. C. B. Sands of Gerinp;, applird 125 lbs. per BCre of treble super phosphate to a 3-year-old iiclil of alfalfa early in the spring of 1030. leaving a portion of the field unfer - tilized. The picture shows 1/1000 acre bundles cut from the fertilized (large bundle) and unfertilized (small bundle) acrcas. These are from the second cuttings. The yields per acre of cured hay were a.-i follows: Untreated 1.17 tons Phospha'ted 1.70 tons Gain 0.53 ton or 46 r /fc The first and third cuttinics were also larger where phosphate was used, according to Mr. Sands. This field has been cropped for 25 years under irrigation and has- been in alfalfa about half of that time. Table 3 summarizes the results of nine experiments with treble superphosphate on corn. It is recommended that farmers, even under the prevailing de - pressed condition, educate themselves on the possibilities of commer - cial fertilizer. It is certainly not profitable on all farms but it iB just as certainly profitable on some farms. In this age of advertising and sales campaigns it is highly important for each individual farmer to know whether or not it is profitable on his farm. It is also Important to know which particular element or what combination of elements is necessary. </seg>

I think probably a straw pile or hay stack available to cattle on sweet clover pasture Is of some benefit. Cattle on sweet clover pasture seem to crave dry feed. Salt and plenty of water are also suggested. These patent medicines to prevent bloat seem to be worthless. If one is pasturing cattle on a succulent lush growth of sweet clover in moist weather, he may as well make up his mind that there is likely to be trouble from bloat. E. R. CHASE: I heard somebody say that you can make sweet clover hay with a binder, by tying it up in bundles, then shock It and stack it and have real good hay for livestock. I thought I would try it, but haven't yet. Have you heard of anyone having had experience in making hay that way? P. H. STEWART: Has anyone here had that experience? No one here seems to have done it that way. I have observed men in Otoe county doing it. The cost is rather high, for twine and labor. If the weather Is damp, the hay may mold under the bands. PETER HORNBY: What about pasturing or mowing sweet clover in the fall when it was sown with oats? Is it beneficial to pasture it or is it better to let the sweet clover grow? • . P. H. STEWART: Mr. Hornby brings up a good point there. It has been shown that sweet clover seeded with oats or barley in the spring, if cut in early September will not come on nearly so rapidly the following Bpring as it would if it were allowed to grow until late fall before being cut or pastured. It is in the fall of its first year that the. sweet clover to a great extent grows its root system. If we start in to mow if, or pasture it in late summer, the chances are that it is going to be set back in its next spring growth. So we must decide which is of most value to us — the late summer or early fall pasture or the early and more rapid growth the next year. It is a question of the value of early pasture or hay compared to a greater and faster early spring growth the next year. MR. ANDERSON: I had hoped somebody would have something to say about Hubam clover. P. H. STEWART: There are several men using it in Nebraska. Some fellows find it particularly valuable from this standpoint: — they can fall plow some of that land, if it Is in Hubam whereas if they fall plow the biennial sweet clover, they may find that it will come on the next spring as if it hadn't been plowed at all. Hubam does not do the soil as much good from the fertility standpoint, but you can get part of your work done in the fall. It does have a beneficial soil effect, but not as much as the biennial varieties. BERT MOTT: I know of a neighbor who Is intending this fall or winter to sow sweet clover in his fall wheat and then he intends next summer to plow the sweet clover, after harvest, and. seed to wheat. He has had a little experience with this and thinks his results are good. </seg>

            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION RKPORT OF THE 1030 NEBRASKA CORN YIELD CONTEST D. L. GROSS and P. H. STEWART* Although 1930 was a year of unusual drouth' over most of the corn belt, the Nebraska Corn Yield Contest came through with flying colors. More men turned in records this year than ever before. The growing Interest in the contest is shown by the record of completions from the year of its inception in 1924* up to the present time. In the first year but 36 completed. Since that time the records are as fol - lows: 1925, 87; 1926, 68; 1927, 116; 1928, 90; 1929, 135; 1930, 172. This Increasing popularity is, of course, not a true measure of the good that is engendered by the contest. The true value is seen in the inspiration that it has given hundreds of farmers, most of whom have not entered the contest at all. Evidence of this is revealed by the more general use of improved cultural practices, improved types and varieties of seed, and from the fact that the use of legumes for improving and maintaining soil fertility has increased at a tremendous rate. In 1920, the sweet clover acreage in Nebraska stood at 30,000. while in 1930 there were 1,125,000 acres. Nearly all of which will be used next year as corn land. ' • At the time the contest was started, most farmers and even men engaged in agricultural education were of the opinion that 50 to 60 bushels of corn was a big yield for Nebraska. Now their sights are set on a much higher mark, owing to the yield possibilities that have been revealed by the contest. During the last seven years, the follow - ing 12 men who have equaled or surpassed the 100-bushel mark, have not only benefited themselves, but their records have served as in - spiration to all other farmers. .

Contestants are scored on the mnu of 65 per cent for yield, 25 per cent for profit per acre, and 10 per cent for the quality of the product. Rent was charged on the share basis, this being arbitrarily set at 2/5 in the eastern and irrigated sections, and % in the central and western sections. Corn was valued at 50 cents for No. 1 corn with 14 per cent moisture. Man labor was valued at 35 cents per hour, and horse labor at 20 cents per hour, this to cover machinery depre - ciation. Husking was charged at 10 cents per bushel to cover labor, wagon, team, and board. Tractors were figured on a scale ranging as follows: 2 bottom plow tractors $1.00 per hour, 3 bottom plow - tractors $1.25 per hour and 4 bottom sizes $1.50 per hour. This also covers depreciation on the machinery which they pull. Except for a few fields which were obviously low in yield, 20 pound samples of ear corn were taken at husking time for shrinkage, shelling and moisture determinations. Yields were figured on shelled corn with 14 per cent moisture. Object of the Contest Although we are very much interested in high yields, one must not lose sight of the fact that the object of the contest is not primarily in high yields but rather in the methods which bring them about, and in the relation of the various factors in corn production to profits per acre. The contest offers an exceptional opportunity to study the methods which the most successful growers are using. The discus - sion which follows brings out the outstanding factors in profitable corn production as gained from the contest. Relation of Legumes to Yield The 1930 contest furnished added proof that in eastern Nebraska and on irrigated land, high yields cannot be obtained without high soil fertility and that legumes are essential. to the maintenance of a productive soil. A review of the rotation systems used by the win - ning contestants of eastern Nebraska for the years 1924 to 1930 emphasizes the importance of this point. Back in 1924, Emil Prusa, the winner of that year, grew his winning ten acres on newly broken alfalfa land. In 1925, Ed. Noyes likewise produced his hundred bushel yield on alfalfa land. In 1926, Howard Mortimore won. with a field newly broken from sod. In 1927, Emmit McArdle produced 93 bushels on newly broken alfalfa ground. Otto Schafer, the winner in 1928, also grew his corn on first year alfalfa land. Last year, Eugene Day produced 107 -bushels on land recently broken from blue grass sod, and in that same year Chris Hinz produced 106 bushels on those old steep hills in Washington county by plowing up a sweet clover pasture. The winner In 1930, Wm. G. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Rohde, grew his corn on 3-year-old alfalfa ground, obtaining a yield of 88 bushels per acre. We might thus go through the whole list of winners in eastern Nebraska and find the same story. High yields are always associated with soils high in fertility, and if the land was not recently broken from sod then we will find a grass or legume of some kind entering in to account for the high yields. This same relationship holds true for land under irrigation farther west, and for the lowlands of central and western Nebraska, except possibly those subject to overflow. On the uplands of central and western Nebraska, the cold facts as revealed by the contest tell a somewhat different story, as shown by the following summary: Record of the Highest Yielding Fields on the Uplands of Eastern, Central, and AVestern Nebraska — 1024 to 198O. Years since highest yielding upland field was broken from grass or legumes. Year [ Eastern Nebraska | Central Nebraska | Western Nebraska 1924 1 ' 40 • 2Q  - 1925 1 • I 40 14 1926 1 ; • 16 30 1927_ 1 40 15 • 1928__ 1 3 g 1929 4 40 U 1930 1 14 12 • The Problem of Soil Fertility in Central and Western Nebraska In but one year of the seven, that of 1928, do we find a man with the highest yield on the upland of the central region, growing his corn on recently broken land. In that year, Mr. Albert Glass of Clay county was high man with a yield of 65 bushels on a field broken from alfalfa three years previously. This is an interesting case for we find that Mr. Glass after breaking up this alfalfa, seeded the land to cane, sudan and kafir for two years before he attempted to grow a grain crop on it. In other words, he used the cane and kaflr to subdue the land and to tie up the excess nitrates, which otherwise would have so overstimulated a corn crop as to make it very sus - ceptible to injury from drouth. This is the great difficulty in those sections. Land recently broken from a legume is quite likely to pro - duce a low yield rather than a high one. The problem of replenishing soil fertility in these sections is Indeed a difficult one. Yet if yields are to be maintained the fertility, referring particularly to nitrogen, must be replenished. Prom the economic standpoint, the seedling of legumes </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION is.no doubt the best method of replenishment. How then to hanaie the land immediately after it has been seeded to a legume, is the problem. Mr. Glass has shown us one way. Are there not other and more economical ways? Better Cultural Practices It might be well to call attention at this point to a cultural prac - tice which is gaining ground rapidly In eastern Nebraska, and which if adopted in central Nebraska particularly should have quite a bear- I ing on the problem of handling newly broken legume land. Back in 192 5, Mr. Ed. Noyes of Valley gained notoriety not only for the fact that he produced 100 bushels of corn per acre, but also for the fact that he first plowed his alfalfa, and then listed the corn instead of the usual practice of surface planting. . One is not able to say whether or not it was on account of the publicity that Mr. Noyes' methods received, but the fact remains there has been a steady and quite unusual increase in this method of handl - ing legume land. Back in 1924, only one man was recorded as having listed his corn into plowed land. In 1929, exactly one-half of all those entered in the contest in the eastern region listed ' their corn and .exactly one-half of those plowed the land before listing. In other words, one-fourth of all the eastern contestants used this method of planting. In 1930, the evidence was even stronger that this is becom - ing an exceedingly popular practice. This year, 23 out of the 77 eastern section contestants, or' nearly %, used this practice. The reason, of course, for its popularity is the fact that listed corn is less likely to be injured by drouth than surface planted corn. It ordinarily makes a slower growth early in the season, makes a less extensive leaf growth, with fewer suckers, and is therefore in better condition to stand hot dry spells later on during the year. The fact that listed corn ordinarily stands much better than sur - face planted corn is another factor influencing farmers toward more listed corn. The increasing use of mechanical corn pickers, is forcing farmers to pay more attention to this factor. It is rather unusual to note that this practice of listing on plowed land is confined almost entirely to eastern Nebraska and to the irri - gated sections. One would seem justified in surmising that it would likewise be a good practice in central Nebraska, particularly on land that has been in alfalfa or sweet clover. Winners Use Ordinary Methods The winners in the contest over the past seven years have not as a whole used any unusual method. The great majority has used the customary practices common to each section. The winners have in - variably, however, paid greater attention than the average to timeli- </seg>
            <seg id="p146">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ness and thoroughness of all operations. The highest yields are never found in weedy fields, which means that cultivation must be timely and thorough. One poor cultivation can ruin the chances for a high yield. It must be remembered, of course, . at this point that high yields are influenced greatly by chance. The timeliness and amount of rainfall play a tremendous part. Seasonal conditions may favor early planting one year and late planting another. This was very forcibly brought to our attention this past year. Late planted corn in many instances made a remarkably good yield, while beside it early planted corn made little or nothing. This, of course, is exceptional and should not be taken as a guide. Seasonal planting on the average proves the best. Although these factors of chance do play a big part in determining the yield of corn, yet the fellow that does get the big yields the most consistently year after year is .the fellow that keeps his house in order so to speak and is thus able to take advantage of the breaks when they do come. The fellow with a weedy field, low in fertility, isn't going to get a good yield no matter what the weather is. Good Seed Important Variety yield tests conducted over the state for the last few years together with experience In the corn yield contest have given convinc - ing evidence that there is a tremendous difference in the yielding ability of different varieties. One is more convinced than ever that the selection of a smooth type of seed is necessary It one is to get the maximum yields. Even then it behooves every farmer to do a little experimenting of his own on his own farm, trying out different strains of corn to see if he cannot find one better than his own. One finds that smoothness is not the whole thing. Some smooth strains are better than others. Another important factor in the choice of seed is the standing ability of the particular strain, and in the tenacity with which the ear stays on the stalk. Varieties differ greatly in this respect. With the advent of the mechanical picker this factor must be given serious consideration. Iiabor Efficiency . . We come now to perhaps the most interesting part of the whole contest, the matter of labor efficiency. Many no doubt are not aware that our Nebraska corn yield contest has attracted nation-wide in - terest mainly through the labor records that it has shown. Nebraska farmers are gaining the reputation as being the most efficient in the world so far as labor Involved In corn production Is concerned. In the short space of seven years the labor utilized on an acre of corn has been very nearly cut in two. The tollowing is a summary of the hours of man labor expended on an acre of corn up to husking: </seg>

In western Nebraska, if a man could handle 100 acres in 1924, in 1930 he could handle 155 acres. Averages, of course, do not tell the whole story. A number of individual records are quite unusual. This past year Floyd Brown of Stamford turned in the unusual record of 1.2 hours per acre. Mr. Brown carried out the usual operations. He disked the ground, listed the corn, used a 4-row cultivator for the first operation, then harrowed, and finally cultivated once more with his 4-row cultivator. In explaining his methods Mr. Brown writes as follows: "We used a tractor and pulled a 10-foot 20-blade disk in high, setting the tractor at maximum speed. Pulled a 2-row lister, and for cultivation used a 4-row tractor weeder pulled in intermediate for both cultivations. We harrowed the corn after throwing out, using a 3-sectlon harrow, pull - ing it in high. This ground was clean, level, and worked easily. I feel that we can handle this field in the same time again If the soil is In the same condition." It must be remembered, of course, that as Mr. Brown points out, the condition of the soil, and the lay of the land, plays an important part. in making- this record. This record was on 55 acres of upland, however, and very similar to a good many other fields. The Use of Multiple Row Machinery Is Increasing As this illustration brings out the gradual decrease in labor re - quirement has been brought about by the increasing use of larger machinery. Records have been kept throughout the seven years of the contest as to the per cent of contestants using 2-row machinery. The'flgures thus secured explain why the man hours expended per acre have been decreasing each year. </seg>

When we get to analyzing the various factors which go to make up the items of cost, we are forced to con - clude that this is a very Intricate and involved question. Costs of growing corn are different on nearly every farm. Labor and rent costs are lower in central and western Nebraska than they are in eastern Nebraska. Some farmers use larger machinery than others, handle more acres per man, and are thus able to reduce costs. The yield per acre is undoubtedly the most influential factor effecting relative costs. In eastern Nebraska with a yield of 30 bushels per acre, corn costs about 55 cents per bushel to produce. With a yield of 60 bushels this cost may be cut down to as low as 36 cents, as illustrated in the following table: Relative Cost Per Bushel of Corn at Different Yields. Eastern Nebraska. Yield Per Acre ITEM 30 bu. | 45 bu. | 60 bu.

Cost per bushel „. _ 55# 42 tf 36tf </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Other factors involved in the cost of growing corn which are even more intangible than the above are such items as the previous crop the previous year's tillage, the cost of legume seed which was seeded on the land one or two years ago, and which effects the yield of corn Some farmers plow their land for oats, with tire idea that the land will list easier the following year when it is put to corn. Should this be charged against the corn crop? If land laid idle the previous year, should the corn crop be charged with two years' rent? These and other similar questions, bring out the fact that the matter of cost cannot always be easily arrived at. Relation of Yield to Profits The last and most important item that we might discuss has to do with the relation of yield per acre and profit. It is perfectly obvious of course, that the greater the yield per acre the greater are the profits likely to be. The importance of this aspect of corn growing is often overlooked or at least underestimated. One might, if he has not given the subject a great deal of thought, have the impression that were one to double his yield he would double his profits, other things being equal, of course. As a matter of fact, however the true story is quite a little different than that. This year with corn at 50 cents per bushel a man in eastern Nebraska just about breaks even with a yield of 35 bushels. By doubling that yield one cannot say how many times the profits are doubled because there aren't any there to double in the first place. On the basis of labor and other charges used in the contest a man in eastern Nebraska with a 40-bushel yield this year isn't making much over a dollar profit per acre figuring on average costs. A yield of only three or four bushels greater than this would double the profits. In other words, if a man is out to make money raising corn at 50 cents per bushel he is going to have to shove the yield up beyond the 35 and 40 bushel mark or he must reduce his costs in some way. It must be appreciated of course that the profits as discussed here are in addition to the hourly wage of 35 cents per hour which is entered as labor charge. - It is interesting to make a comparison between eastern, central, and western Nebraska on the relation of yield to profit at different prices per bushel. </seg>

One must not lose sight of the fact, however, that western Nebraska farmers do not necessarily make greater profits on corn than do eastern Nebraska men, because yields are ordinarily lower in west - ern Nebraska. With a 50-bushel yield in eastern Nebraska and a 24 - bushel-yield In western Nebraska, the cost per bushel is about the same or 40 cents. The profit per acre in the west, however, would be but $1.60, while in the east it would be $3.00 because of the greater number of bushels. A 50-bushel yield in eastern Nebraska and a 30 - bushel yield in western Nebraska are about equally profitable with corn at 50 cents per bushel. When the market price of corn is 60 cents, the western man must produce 34 bushels to reap the same profit per acre as the eastern man with a yield of 50 bushels. With average sectional costs and rental charges, the eastern man with a yield of 35 bushels produces corn at about 50 cents per bushel, while the western man, having a lower labor and rental expense, can pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p152">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE duce corn at the same cost with a yield of 17 bushels per acre ■ It must be remembered that ordinarily the western man receives less per bushel on the market than the eastern man, because of the greater distance of the farmer to market centers. With corn at 50 cents in the east and 40 cents in the west, the western man must produce 42 bushels per acre to obtain the same acre profit as the eastern man with a 50-bushel yield. Pour Factors Influence Proflt An analysis of the above table brings out that there are four ractors which have an influence on the proflt or loss in raising corn or any other crop for that matter. These factors are yield, labor and machine cost, rentals or land values, and price per bushel. In other words, when prices are low as they are this year we have to look to the other factors more closely if we are to receive any profits Since rentals or land values cannot be influenced to any extent we thus must in reality look principally to the other two factors, yield and labor and machine costs. Nebraska farmers are making real progress toward the goal of lower costs per acre and from the fact that they are rapidly increasing their legume acreage and are improving their cultural practices and the type of seed they plant, there is good evi - dence that they are making good progress toward the goal of higher </seg>

            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION PRESENTATION OP MEDALS A. H. MILLER, Blair. State Board of Agriculture. As I sat back there listening to the deliberations of your organi - zation I could hardly remain quiet. I just wanted to say "yes" or "no" as the motion was made. I always feel that I must have some interest or something to say when you are putting the motion, and I wondered how I could be a member of this organization so that I might take part. I live on a farm and about once a week there comes to our place some solicitor asking that either I become a member of some insurance company or farm organization, or what not, and if I am so inclined perhaps I become a member, but the Crop Growers' Association, neither the members nor the officers, have ever on any occasion solicited my membership. Neither did I know whether I was eligible and hence I must confess I am not a member. I don't know whether I was derelict in my duties but now I am going to become a member by presenting my dollar. You will bear witness to the fact that I have deposited the required fee. I was intensely interested in Professor Gross' speech and especial - ly in the figures which showed the difference in profits between the western, central, and eastern sections of the contest. I might add that I live in the eastern section. I own a spot which I thought pretty good until Mr. Gross referred to our country as a hilly country where they had' to put in the corn with a shot gun. But be that as it may, here the soil extends down to an unlimited depth. By plowing deep and properly fertilizing it, this soil will become as high yielding as any in the United States — 1 daresay in the world. But here was the striking thing in the report, that a small yield in the western part of the state would give a profit. The same yield in the eastern section would show a loss. But when the yield in - creases from 25 to 4 5 bushels, which is our good crop yield, in Wash - ington county we secure a profit. Of course, they have a profit in the western section where yield is greater but the proportion has decreased when compared with the eastern part. That was the interesting thing. In other words, they do not make as much in proportion to the yield as we do. That is a significant table and I congratulate Mr. Gross in bringing the figures so favorably before us. Efficiency as applied in this day and age is the key to all successful business. It holds true in the manufacturing industry, railroading, banking, or any other legitimate industry. Strong competition both in the production of an article and in its distribution has made this efficiency necessary. Any business that does not make efficiency its watchword soon ceases to be a going concern. </seg>

In other words, efficiency bears a direct relation to the Income that will accrue to the farmer. To be sure, rainfall has its effect upon crop yields but that can be partially adjusted by efficient and effectual tillage. There - fore, it is almost as necessary to study methods of tillage as it is to study fertility. The past season was unusual in some instances in the lack of moisture and in drying winds. But in spite of that these outstanding farms have produced wonderful results. Honor to Agricultural Workers We have been prone to consider master of industries heroes at whose' feet we should lay the laurel wreath of praise. Give honor and praise to whom it is due. But I consider one who has achieved remarkable success in farming worthy of more praise than one who has had equal success in the big business world. The farmer deals directly with nature while other business does not, necessarily. Tc produce food to feed the world is the farmer's aim and that after all is the most important thing in the' field of endeavor. We may live without other things to a certain extent but we cannot exist without something to eat. Therefore the farmer's aim should be the highest in the world. These men whom we are honoring have done much for agri - culture. They have demonstrated in a practical manner what can be accomplished by efficiency. The high yields of corn they have secured, is evidence of their value to the communities in which they live. It shows clearly what can be done in a particular locality. May the medals which they receive be an incentive for greater efforts In the future. Their work is not finished, it has just begun! </seg>

Improved Reids yellow dent seed corn was used on this field. It tested about 100 and has been grown on this farm the last ten years. I feel sure that the yield from this field would have been higher had it not been for the dry weather that we had last summer. Next year I hope to get a bushel or so of hybrid corn and compare it with the Improved Reids yellow dent. </seg>

I have spent most of my life on a farm, and have never found a Royal Road that leads to big yields. Each year is a problem in itself, no two being alike in general conditions. I prepared the seedbed in the spring to the best of my ability, under the prevailing conditions, and try to start listing by the 10th of May. This is early enough under most all conditions. In due time the ground is cultivated twice, in order to work the lister ridges down until the field is level. Any cultivation that is done after this is for the sole purpose of destroying weeds, and not for loosening the ground. I use a tractor and horses in all of my farming operations, with two and three-row machinery, thereby keeping the cost per acre as low as possible. The only thing for a farmer to do, is do the very best that can be done under the existing conditions, and trust to luck in regard to floods, drouths, hot winds, etc. </seg>

In growing this corn, the Important things were fertility, water, seed corn, and labor. This particular field of corn was broken up by my father about 24 years ago and farmed in oats and corn for three years, and then put into al - falfa for, I believe, 8 or 9' liiDKK^fllBHIHBI years, then broken up arid ■BnifcBftV^'iBK'l^iiiii ' 'WifflJBllfa planted to corn, oats, and I V -mB8SeS corn. Then I raised beets a '' '-^""i^B couple of years, making 17% jjST^jBflH^HI SMSf^T^HI ton per acre.

About the ['\JL'jKBl&amp;^9^^^P^^^^^^^^H only thing we needed to go '/*M^B ahead and make the crop was Bf^5 the weather and water. SK W^Sj^l^r'^ I plowed that field about *V^3 HP"^9|^^^H the first of May. Soon after- jt^M - "^^BH^.i . - 1 ward we had about 12 inches i'^SSS Vi'N of snow and 2 or 3 inches of Kb ■ - ■ i^P "-". „ i rain. This packed it -down t^'~- V - '\ very nearly as hard as the ' v - -^^B'V ground could get, so I had an- V^r iSi*. other job of working it up. . &gt; ~^rt^^nt&gt; fc . 'Si When I was down here last i^*-*JB Bfctfci*jl^ SSK^TwB year I heard about the rotary Ty : : hoe.

I had plenty of weight, and plenty of speed, and put it in wonderful condition again. So I planted the corn on the 23rd of May and just about two days after that we had a 3%-inch rain. I had the same thing to contend with again. Again I got in with the rotary hoe. The corn after I went over with the hoe came up in fine shape. </seg>
            <seg id="p162">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ' I planted the corn by the same method as last year, using the idea that I got from the sugar beet company — more beets planted a per acre, more tons per acre. I Used an International planter, nar- rowed runners up to 30 inches-, and drilled the corn. The way it figured out when this Lincoln man was out there and tested, 82 stalks for every 100 feet of row, so I did have a good stand. In the cultivation of this corn, for the first two times, I used the rotary hoe and I found out that it didn't tear the corn but like I thought it would when I got it. These fellows down here told me it wouldn't. I used a beet cultivator. I found with two horses that I could cultivate two rows at a time. When I had it laid by the ditches were there for irrigation, so that was all that was left to do. So after I had this corn up and laid by the next thing was the water. We had several nice rains. On my place I have an irriga - tion pump of the six-inch centrifugal submerged type. I was fixed for water. I also have access to an irrigation ditch out of the Platte river. The ditch cost 50 cents per acre per year for maintenance. It pays for itself. I can irrigate 20 rows at a time with this pump. QUESTION: How deep is the well? ANSWER: Forty-nine feet deep. The water comes up within 10 feet of the top of the ground. I pumped nine days and nine nights at one time and lowered the water level 20 feet from the top of the ground; that is, I pulled it down 10 feet when pumping at full capacity. I don't lay all of the credit for this high yield to the fertility of the soil, the water, or the labor. One of my neighbors said: "Well, George, you have a good rich field there. No wonder you have a good crop." Another said, "Pretty fair seed corn." No one said any - thing about the labor. I put a lot of emphasis on the type of corn planted. This seed corn is a white variety. A lot of people are prejudiced against white corn. Where we can raise so many more bushels per acre on irri - gated or dry land with white corn, as I believe we can, we should use it. Some neighbors bought seed corn from me and cleaned me out. Those neighbors say that this white corn is superior to. the yellow corn which they have planted for years. Mr. Albert Kostie of Big Springs said this white corn yielded 18' bushels per acre more than his yellow. Last year I told you I had rough type of seed. Around my neighborhood they plant a flinty type, so slick that it just runs out of the wagon. My corn tallies up with your smooth type of corn out there in the show, so I guess I did make a mistake when I said I had a rough type corn. We are kind of handicapped this season. I have now about forty acres in the field yet, under two feet of snow. So there is a big job ahead of me yet. </seg>

Winner Second Place in Irrigated Section and also in Dawson County. 92.7 Bushels Per Acre. Naturally I am quite proud of the results of the 1930 contest. I would like very much to be with you next Wednesday but it will be impossible. Now as to the story, there isn't much to tell as I farmed it in the usual way. The main essentials which we find necessary in raising good corn are; first, good ground; second, good seed; third, good cultiva - tion; and last but not least, water. Plenty of it and at the right time. This completes man's part of the game, the rest comes from a higher power. ' ! i. ' i The ground was second bottom or bench land, some fifteen feet above water, two years since it was in alfalfa. The stalks from last year's crop were burned, the land double disked and listed about May 15th to 18th. We cover the corn quite shallow, about an inch to an inch and a half, but make our ridges quite deep. The seed was Funk's Hybrid No. 365 and dropped about ten inches apart In rows forty inches apart. We cultivated twice with a "Go-Dig" and once with a cultivator or "Layby", each time doing the cultivating just as early as possible. The sooner each time the better, just as quick as the corn is large enough. The first time over is the most important, do a good job then if never afterward. . We irrigated the 7th of July and soaked it very thoroughly. This particular part of the field was watered again . in about three or four weeks. It may be of interest to know that the only time we used horses was to rake the stalks and make the ditches for irrigating. Much credit is due the seed. It was good big plump seed, evenly graded, good germination, and grew very fast right from the start. This corn is very easy to husk and stands up much better than our common corn. </seg>

This corn, was planted on alfalfa ground, the first year to be in corn. I was very careless in the selection of the seed corn which was not selected but was just common hand picked from my own stock. The corn was planted with a two-row lister which made it impossible to get closer together or I believe I could have increased my yield. The outstanding feature in this yield, I believe, was the fact that I was ready for irrigation when the water first showed up and stayed on day and night until the entire field was watered. Part was watered twice but. due to the shortage of water was unable to complete the second run. I am pleased to accept your congratulations.

VINCENT REHMEIEK, Weeping Water Winner In the Eastern Region of the Junior Corn Yield Contest with a Yield of 60.0 Bushels. This is my first year in a corn club. I have been in the pig club five years, three years in dairy calf club and one year in baby beef. The field I selected for my corn was broke from native sod in 1918 and has been in corn every year since. The field is bottom land -and protected by timber on the south and west. This no doubt was a very good factor this year as the trees protected the field from the hot winds. The stalks were cut and it was plowed very deep this spring. After the plowing the ground was harrowed and disked well to make a good solid seedbed. The corn was listed on May 20 with 40-inch rows and 16 inches between stalks. The first time over the two-row machine was used and afterwards it was cultivated twice. After the last cultivation I went through the field with the hoe and cut out all the weeds. My father has been growing Reid's yellow dent for five years and the smooth, medium sized type of ear has been selected for seed. Our seed corn is always picked early in the fall and stored in the barn. The seed I planted last summer was tested for germination last spring and tested 98 per cent. I did all the work myself, except half of the spring plowing that I could not do on account of school work. My father says this year's yield of 60 bushels Is below the average yield of the field for 13 years that the field has been in cultivation. The fact that I had a good piece of ground, well protected from the hot winds, prepared a good seedbed,. and used good seed, are the things that I consider the most valuable in winning me this medal. </seg>

Yield — 52 Bushels. My first intention of entering the 4-H club work was after our county agent gave us a very interesting talk on club work. That day our Milligan High School corn club was organized. In about a week I bought a bushel of. Reid's yellow dent seed corn from a farmer near Omaha". This seed tested 98 per cent in germination. The plot that father rented me was partly bottom land and part hilly. This field was in corn last year and the year before in sweet clover. The sweet clover was plowed under in late May. That year the corn yielded about 35 bushels. Oats was sown in with the sweet clover which was harvested the same summer while the sweet' clover remained another winter. . I prepared the seedbed by cutting down the stalks and then disk - ing them. The corn was listed in about the beginning of the third week in May. After a week's time very little of the corn came up on account of the hard crust. I took a cracker jack and cultivated the corn by pushing the soil away from the corn, in this way the hard crust was broken. In about ten days most of the corn was up. The corn averaged about 1 6 inches apart from hill to hill. The corn grew very fast after it was cultivated the second time. I cultivated it the third time with a cultivator deeper than before, shortly afterwards a heavy rain came, but most of the moisture stayed in the soil for the top of the soil was very soft. The corn was in the milky stage during the first part of September. I went out into the field October first to select my seed corn. About five bushels were selected. I did not pick the longest ears for seed but those of medium size arid of a cyllnderical shape, with uniform kernels, well filled at tips and butts. </seg>

Yield of 60 Bushels. As a winner of the gold medal for the best yield in the western region of the State of Nebraska In the 1930 contest, I can justly say I am real proud. Although as a 4-H cluber, I have learned not to reel above the other members. No matter how good we plant our corn or how gnod we take care of it, if the weather conditions are not favorable we don't have much luck producing a good yield. I chose calico corn for my ten acres. I picked the medium sized ears filled to the butt and tips, with straight rows, and even kernels. I also tested this corn, using the rag doll method. It tested 98 per cent My corn ground was in good condition for planting. It was double disked, then harrowed. I then listed it, planting one bushel to ten acres. All the listing was completed by the 10th of May. Then we had some hard beating rains, and snows, making it difficult for the corn to break through the ground. For this reason, I had to re - plant. This I did with the lister and I planted it in the same rows, planting it quite shallow. This was completed by the latter part of May. While the corn was growing, weather conditions were excellent, having plenty of rain and warm weather. The corn was unmolested until it was above the ground about two inches. I went over it with a go-dig, working the ridges down as much as possible. After the plants were about five inches tall, I cultivated it, throwing in all the soil I could without covering the corn. Waiting until the corn was about 12 inches tall, I again went over it similarly, throwing in more soil. The last time I cultivated a few ears had made their appearance. At all times, I kept the soil loose and free from weeds. In the middle of November, I had my corn harvested with a corn picker. It averaged sixty bushels to the acre. As to club work, I must say that I have greatly enjoyed my experiences, the knowledge gained and my associations with other 4-H club boys and girls. I have completed three years in the pig club project. Now I have a pure bred Chester White sow which has far - rowed a litter of eleven pigs. I am keeping the four gilts and the sow, breeding them to a purebred boar. My leader has presented me with the 4-H club" pin, having com - pleted four years of club work. I have enjoyed every minute of con - tact with this great organization and I recommend it to every boy and girl. </seg>

Winner of Irrigated Section of the Junior Corn Yield Contest. Yield— 90.9 Bushels. I think that the things which helped me to get a yield of 91). a bushels were: good soil fertility, good seed, an even stand, water at about the proper time, fall plowing, and good cultivation. It is hard to say which one factor is the most important, because all must be considered. My corn was grown on alfalfa ground that was broken up In September, 1929. Our fall plowing yielded ten bushels more than our spring plowing. This field had been in alfalfa for about ten years. We plowed it about five to six inches deep, using a gang plow, pulled by horses. In fact, all of our work was done by horses. This was all that we did until the latter part of April, when we gave it a light disking. . Our corn was listed in rows 40 inches apart and we aimed to plant one kernel, every 15 inches. Some of our farmers plant it thicker than this with very good results. However, this depends upon the soil fertility, and the amount of water available. The variety of corn we used was white dent that has been In the neighborhood for at least ten yeara. Some of our seed was selected early in the field and part was taken from the husking wagons. It was put on a drying rack and kept there until spring. Each ear was examined for germination. It was tipped and butted by hand, but was not graded. My field was cultivated four times, twice with a two-row go-dig [ and twice with a two-row high cultivator. The last time we used disks next to the corn to ridge it for irrigation. We only watered this corn once, due to the scarcity of water. This was in the latter part of July. If the subsoil had not been soaked ■good by the rains in the spring it would not have come through as well as it did because the corn suffered for about ten days before we got water. My total cost per acre was $18.34 or 23c per bushel for all corn raised. Figuring one-third rent my cost cost 34.4 cents per bushel. Good soil fertility, good. seed, and an even stand, water at about the proper time, fall plowing, good cultivation, and a fair amount of luck were what helped me to make the yield I made this year. </seg>

T. A. kiesselbach This can best be established by tests in his particular locality. In order to secure such information the Agricul - tural College has gone right out to a number of eastern Nebraska farms and co-operated with the farmers in comparing their varieties with the best hybrids available, as well as with other outstanding farmers' varieties. Such a co-operative program is participated in by the Experiment Station, the Agricultural Extension Service, represented by P. H. Stewart and D. L. Gross, the local Farm Bureau through its County Agent, and the farmer on whose land the tests are made. CO-OPERATIVE TESTS IN 1930 Varieties and Hybrids Tested In the spring of 1930 a collection of 34 varieties and hybrids was assembled for comparative testing on each of four Eastern Nebraska farms. This collection consisted of thirteen farmers' varieties, nine commercial hybrids, and twelve experimental hybrids. The varieties included some of the best standard sorts that have gained prominence in Nebraska or elsewhere in the corn belt. On three of the farms the owner's own seed was included. There have been to date only four commercial producers of hybrid seed corn who were offering hybrid seed for sale to Nebraska farmers. These sources were (1) Funk Bros. Seed Company of Bloomlngton, Illinois; (2) Hi-Bred Corn Company of Grimes, Iowa; (3) Henry Field </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE •=«" Company of Shenandoah, Iowa, and (4) Mangelsdorf Seed Com - pany of Atchison, Kansas. Commercial hybrids from these four sources were included in order to determine their productivity under our con - ditions, and to what extent Nebraska corn growers might be justified in planting them. The experimental hybrids were some that had given promise of good performance in earlier Experiment Station or co-operative tests, but whose seed supply was very limited and not available commer - cially, and therefore regarded as still in the experimental stage. If any of these should prove good enough they could be increased for farm use. The four hybrids marked "Holbert" have been developed by J. R. Holbert of the United States Department of Agriculture. Nine hybrids carrying Nebraska numbers were made by the Nebraska Ex - periment Station by combining inbreds developed either by this station or obtained from corn workers in other states. In addition to the above collections, two experimental hybrids from the Iowa Experiment Station, and two farmer's varieties were included in only one or two Of these co-operative tests as indicated in Table 1. Method of Testing The various lots of corn were planted and cared for In a manner that is rather customary in such comparisons. Three-row plats at least 25 hills long were planted in duplicate. In order to secure com - parable stands, the corn was hand planted at the rate of five kernels per hill and uniformly thinned in the seedling stage to three plants per hill. The middle row of each plat was harvested for the yield determination. The yields were calculated for shelled corn of a uni - from 14 per cent moisture content. Hogue Yellow Dent from the Nebraska Experiment Station was used as a check throughout all tests. In the accompanying Table No. 1, which contains the results, the yield of this variety is used as a basis (100 per cent) for compar - ing the other sorts. That is, the yields of all the different sorts are reported in bushels per acre, and also in percentage of the Hogue corn. Results An examination of the data in Table 1 discloses that certain hy - brids were outstandingly good on all four farms. The best of these averaged 26 per cent higher yield than Hogue Yellow Dent. The 12 high yielding lots were hybrids. The five best hybrids averaged 12.5 bushels or 20 per cent more than the best five varieties. It is especially in - teresting to note that as a summary for all four tests, the 21 hybrids averaged 65.1 bushels in comparison with 58.0 bushels for the 13 varieties. This is a superiority of seven bushels, or 12 per cent. The nine commercial hybrids averaged 1 per cent less than Hogue Yellow Dent, and ranged from a maximum superiority of 6 per cent </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION • to a minimum of 11 per cent less than the Hogue. These daia are not very encouraging to the commercial hybrids available last year and suggest the desirability of marked conservatism in the use of such hybrids at the present stage of their development. SUMMARY OF CO-OPERATIVE RESULTS DURING SEVERAL YEARS Tests rather similar to those described for 1930 have also been made during the three preceding years. The results are summarized .in Tables 2 and 3. In Table 2 is reported a 4-year summary for the 5 best hybrids of each test in comparison with the 5 best varieties. The differences in favor of the hybrid groups were 10%, 22%, 16% and 16% in 1927, 1928, 1929, and 1930 respectively. In Table 3 are given the corresponding annual average results for all hybrids compared with all varieties included in the tests. In 1927 the hybrids actually averaged one per cent less than the varieties; while in 1928, 1929 and 1930 the superiority of the hybrids was 11, 12 and 14 per cent respectively. These data Indicate progress by way of discontinuing a number of low-yielding hybrids. With the advent and growing use of mechanical harvesters, a special demand is being created for productive lodge-resistant corn with ear shanks sufficiently strong to prevent the ear from dropping off. Some of the better hybrids are somewhat superior in these re - spects. Selection for these characters is being especially stressed In the present breeding program. PRESENT STATUS OF COMMERCIAL HYBRIDS "Should Nebraska farmers buy hybrid seed corn?" This is per - haps one of those questions that could be beBt answered by both "Yes" and "No." Possibly we should proceed cautiously in arriving at the answer. Let us analyze the present status of hybrid corn available for farm use in Nebraska and reach a decision on its own merits. In the first place, if we recommend that hybrid corn should be planted, we do It knowing that the best grades of seed will cost at present from about $9 to $15 per bushel. What is the likelihood that the crop will be worth sufficiently more to justify this expenditure? At a cost of $9 per bushel, we have a minimum outlay of about $1.50 for seed to plant each acre. At 50c a bushel it would be neces - sary to grow 3 bushels more per acre to just pay for the seed. After allowing for the added cost of harvesting and marketing a larger crop, it would seem necessary to have an increaed yield of 4 bushels per acre to just pay for the seed. There is a little saving to the farmer who would otherwise pick his seed from his own crop in that he will be relieved of this expense </seg>

Sufficient allowance will be made for this saving if we conclude that the corn grower must have 3% bushels per acre higher yield when market corn brings 50c per bushel and hybrid seed costs $9 per bushel, in order to just break even with the added cost of the hybrid seed. This means that farmers who normally pro - duce an average of 35 bushels per acre would need to have a 10 per cent increase in yield from hybrid corn to .pay for the added cost of the seed at prevailing prices. Note the uniformity of this hybrid corn on the C. Y. Thompson farm. There are relatively few people in the corn belt producing what has come to be known as hybrid seed corn, which may prove adapted to Nebraska. There are no producers of such seed in Nebraska, altho various hybrids are offered for sale to our farmers from Illinois, Iowa and Kansas sources. Commercial seed from these respective . states has been tested during the last 4 years (Table 4) at the Nebraska experiment Station at Lincoln and in a number of out-lying tests which have been co-operative with farmers in the eastern part of the state. During the last 3 years, hybrid seed from Illinois has averaged 8 per cent more than the 5 best farmers' varieties included in the tests. Commercial hybrid seed from Iowa has averaged 1 per cent more grain per acre than the 5 best farmers' varieties during the same 3 : years. Similar seed from Kansas has been tested during the last 2 years with an average yield just equal to that of the 5 best farmers' varieties. A straight average of the commercial seed from these 3 states would indicate a possible increase of 3 per cent in yield for the com - mercial hybrids offered to Eastern Nebraska farmers.

            <seg id="p178">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE we certainly could not recommend a general growing of hybrid corn in preference to the beat open pollinated farmers' varieties. On the other hand, these hybrids are probably not at all equally productive In any given locality and certain ones may prove sufficiently superior and outstanding after several years of testing to fully justify their use. At the same time, it is quite likely that some may actually prove inferior. Hybrid corn is not all favorably productive. This Is likely to be the case especially just now in the beginnings of this kind of seed when its originators are themselves still experimenting and in some cases one may be unable to get the same kind of seed two years in succession for testing. We may take it for granted that the reliable producers of hybrid seed corn are making a sincere effort to develop superior yielding corn which may be depended upon year after year. The new principles of corn improvement which have been discovered and developed by corn workers in a number of the state and federal institutions of this country have been proved fully sound and promising. It appears to be but a matter of a few years until this type of corn breeding work has progressed sufficiently far that it will have entirely passed the experimental stage. Specialized seed corn growers will then be pro - ducing seed in many communities. There has tended to be quite a high degree of conservatism on the part of experiment stations in the distribution of seed stocks for farm use in the making of hybrid seed corn. There has seemed to be little need for hasty and premature ac - tion. The old adage will apply, "It is better to be safe than sorry." SEED FROM FIRST GENERATION HYBRID CROP One point in connection with the use of hybrid seed corn that is not very generally understood is that the farmer should never select seed from the first generation hybrid crop that he grows from it. The high yield is confined to the first crop after the cross is made. Seed picked from this crop will surely have a much lower yield capacity. The true hybrid corn now offered for sale is nearly all double crossed seed made up by crossing together either 3 or 4 suitable inbred lines. These inbred lines themselves yield only about half as much as ordin - ary corn. The second generation crop cannot be expected to yield more than 75 to 85 per cent as much as the first generation hybrid. It is therefore apparent that if hybrid seed is used at all a new supply should be purchased every year. This is very different than in the case of ordinary farmers' varieties with which it is possible to grow ones own seed supply after merely getting enough for a start. It is certainly far simpler to grow seed of the ordinary farmers' varieties and we believe that the corn growers of Nebraska will want to be fully convinced through experience before Investing much in hybrid seed corn. ■ But for those who are especially interested, we would recommend planting small amounts of hybrid seed from several sources in comparison with the best farmers' varieties obtainable. In some </seg>

Aside from making hish yields, good hybrids have ■tiff stalks with uniform high quality ears attached at a uniform height. Furthermore, it is just as important that hybrid corn be well adapted to the local conditions as has been the case with ordinary varieties. This can be established by test. As the years go by, a continued improvement in hybrid seed may be expected, from the standpoints of such characters as yield, quality of grain, and strength of stalk and ear attachment. All of these char - acters should be considered when purchasing hybrid seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p180">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE TRY HYBRIDS EXPERIMENTALLY To summarize, I will say "Yes" to those Interested corn growers who believe in doing some experimenting and want to help along in a constructive movement for the improvement of corn. Purchase a little hybrid seed and give it a fair trial in comparison with the best farm seed obtainable. To the great majority of farmers who are looking for a seed supply to plant the bulk of their acreage, I would say "No." Until you are convinced through local trials on a small scale during a period of several years, make no extensive purchases of hybrid seed. And In every case, be sure that the hybrid seed has been dveloped by approved methods. The Agricultural College will continue in its efforts to establish the possibilities of this kind of seed. Some of the experimental hybrids not yet available commercially give evidence of yielding at least 15 per cent more than the best open - pollinated varieties. - , REGIONAL ADJUSTMENTS IN AGRICULTURE TO CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS M. L. WILSON, Bozeman, Montana • Professor of Agricultural Economics, Montana State College There is an old saying that when we solve one problem in society, we get as a result two new ones. In agriculture for the past genera - tion we have been solving the problem of efficiency, control of nature's forces through scientific knowledge, increasing output per man, elim - ination of waste, etc. Also, the problems attendant to the develop - ment of new lands. Just now the more pressing problems in agricul - ture have to do with its adjustment in a changing economic world, such that the raw materials of food and clothing can be paid for by consumer at prices satisfactory to farmer. It Is important that this is attacked in a manner which is democratic and economically sound and In full conformity with the economic law to the effect that eco - nomic forces tend to have commodities produced in the regions which have the greatest comparative advantage, by the most efficient meth - ods and by the more capable farm managers. The problem of agri - cultural adjustments, therefore, 1b primarily one of regions and in planning for the reduction of undesirable acreages of surplus com - modities, we must be careful that we do not fall into a blind circle and shift from one bad situation to another. If, for example, the resources of the surplus wheat areas were shifted into hogs, wheat farmers might be to some extent better off, but hog farmers through - out the United States would probably be much worse off -because of this new shifted production.

Larger farm machinery. Important among which is the combine, is bringing about changes and adjustments in agriculture. . . MACHINE AGE AT HAND Agriculture today is greatly effected by the machine and scien - tific age in which we live. The steel plow came into use about 1837 and doubled the amount of land one man could plow, the mower in 1842 increased by five times the amount of hay one man could cut, likewise the reaper Increased the output of human labor eight times. Since the world war a large proportion of the wheat production of the United States, Canada, Argentine and Australia has been mechan - ized by means of the tractor, the combine and the truck. Various estimates indicate that this has increased the output per man from three to six times over what he produced with horse farming. This has caused a great shifting of acreage. It gives a new advantage to those wheat producers who can efficiently and economically use the mechanical equipment and similarly a disadvantage to those farmers and those regions which cannot. The change made possible in corn growing through the use of three and four row equipment and two row corn pickers is also very great. While these mechanical things are spectacular and striking, there has nevertheless been an important rise in the efficiency of animal production.

All of those things combined it is estimated has given agriculture since the war, an increased output per man or gain in efficiency of 29%%. During the same period mass production engineering and greater mechanization have Increased the estimated output per industrial worker 42%. These two things, efficiency and expansion in agriculture and efficiency and mass production in industry have given us the two great problems of our present civilization; the surplus in agriculture and unemployment In industry. AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED The impact of machinery on farming, changed and changing de - mands of consumer, International trade barriers, and other factors are forcing adjustments and change. These are going to take place whether we like it or not. If adjustments and change can be guided by carefully ascertained facts and by scientific data, then we can assume that the adjustments will take place with far less human pain and suffering, less economic waste and in a shorter space of time, as well as with greatest advantage to all, than if it moves along more or less blindly. Agricultural agencies are beginning to discuss planned programs of agricultural readjustment. We hope that these will be arrived at democratically by producing farmers in co-operation with their research and extension agencies. There are two steps In planned regional agricultural readjustment which are now being discussed: First: The working out carefully of the "types of farming areas" where farms and farming is in general similar. It is probable that there are more than five hundred of these regions in the United States. They are potentially in com - petition with each other, some are inherently stronger than others in the competition and unquestionably, if we are to be on a contracting basis, weaker areas will grad - ually disappear from the picture. Second: It is necessary to study scientifically the competition be - tween regions and the competitive strength of each, and also to work out plans for the readjustment of the reorgan - ization of farms so that they will take full advantage of changes in machinery and improved methods of produc - tion. At the present time, much emphasis is given by our extension agencies annually to the economic outlook for agriculture, but so far it is impossible to tie these general statements, relative to production and demand, down to specific programs in specific areas. The type of information outlined above would give our extension agencies and the farmers of each region definite knowledge as to where they stand in relation to other competitive producers of the same commodity. It would also show the possibility of shifts to other crops and livestock </seg>

MARSH, Archer Regent, University of Nebraska The topic assigned to me suggests at once a sociological problem of first magnitude. The uninterrupted drift of our rural population to urban centers, with its inevitable sequence of larger farms and tenantless houses has for every thoughtful mind a most foreboding aspect. The acknowledged advantages, financial and otherwise, that accrue to farmers with large holdings of land must not, in a study of the subject, be allowed to weigh against the larger Interests of com - munity welfare and the ultimate weal of vast multitudes of people. Eventually, it seems to me there must be a checking of the present tendency, or a complete reversal of it. Indeed, one cannot remain long in any city without meeting those who have once lived in the country and are longing to return to it again. A man who had failed of re-election to a very high office said to me, "My wife and I are fully reconciled to the result of the election. We will be happier and better off at home." What a splendid phil - osophy: "Better off at home!" Who Isn't better off at home? Regard - less of what life has brought in wealth, in honor, in social -prestige, in scholarly distinction, there is, after all, for each of us a tiny world radiating from our own hearthstone, and including in its environs a few souls more precious than life itself, which holds all that is vital to our happiness and peace of mind. "Home," in our language, is the name which we give to that sweet refuge. And of all homes, I can - not escape the conviction that farm homes are best. How many men, weary, sick and disappointed with ungainful strife, have turned at last to the land, to find in the constancy of dog or horse, solace and healing for a broken spirit and sweet forgetfulness of human infidel - ity.

"Snow-bound," one of the great and popular classics of our language, has Its setting in the simple life of a New England farm - stead a hundred years ago. The wellsprings of poetic imagination in all times have been largely discovered out In the open country. Since we are most directly interested in a discussion of this topic as it relates to our own state. It may be interesting and profitable to spend a few minutes In retrospective view of those successive steps by which we have arrived at our present state of affairs. Risking an affront to good taste, I shall be quite personal In this narrative, feel - ing that authenticity is better guaranteed when a speaker has per - sonal knowledge or first-hand information of the events described. It -is reasonably safe to say that the people who made up the lit - tle settlement at Bellevue — established early In the last century, were less interested in agriculture than they were In trade with the Indians and with travellers enroute for the west. My maternal grandfather came to Bellevue quite early in the fifties and a little later, in the fall of 1858 — removed to a site near the north bank of the Platte River In what is now Merrick County. His progeny to a very large extent still dwell In that vicinity. He was the first white settler with a family to establish a home in that part of the state. A very rude home it was, with sides of rough-hewn logs and a roof of spicy cedar boughs, which singularly enough proved an adequate shelter during the mild winter of '58-'59. Other homes similar to this were established at intervals of twelve or fifteen miles, mostly on the river front, and all along the great trail which led from Omaha to Denver, and thence on to Virginia City and the Pacific Ocean. These stopping, places for a never-ending stream of freighters and other weary travellers were called taverns. These tavern-keepers sought as far as possible to supply the creature needs of travellers. Especially were the freighters glad to secure some provender at these stopping places for their oxen and horses. Since freight rates on some articles to Virginia City ran as high as a dollar a pound, they could not afford to weight their wagons at the starting point with grain that could be purchased along the way. Grandfather raised all the corn he could and sold it readily at $2.00 per bushel. Also, In the late fall and winter he and my uncle would drive over Into Iowa and buy great loads of corn at 10 cents a bushel to be resold later to freighters at many times the cost. Soon young men, sons often of the tavern-keepers, began to establish themselves upon land adjacent to the trail, determining the limits of their claims by count - ing the telegraph poles in the Government line that ran parallel with the road. These boys were soon called to service in the Civil War, and some of them found upon their return that they had been crowded </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION out by the Government survey which had been made in the interim. Other lands were, of course, available and no hardship was imposed. The year 1862 gave us our Homestead law, but it was not until the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad that the real settlement of Nebraska began. It was during the years "71 and "72 that the great influx of people occurred. And here we should pause for a moment to pay tribute to those splendid men and women who first came to make their homes upon these limitless prairies. Clear of eye, strong of heart, and resolute of purpose they came — a great army, dotting in a day the mighty landscape with their nouses of sod and quickly transforming the unbroken sward of native grass into fields of beautiful golden grain. Thus amid hardships and privations almost unbelievable the foundations of our present rural civilization were laid. Schoolhouses, some of cheap wooden construction, but many of sod, sprang up. An occasional church came into view. People were happy because of a spirit . of real neighborllness, a spirit quite unknown, I fear, to some of us now. Probably very few of the early settlers had thought, at first, of acquiring land beyond the quarter section upon which they had settled, but when a few years later the Tree Culture Act was passed, many improved the opportunity of securing an additional quarter sec - tion, usually of less deirable land than the original homestead. It is about this time In our history that the larger farm idea began to obtrude. The Government had given the Union Pacific Rail - road a vast tract of land, consisting of each alternate section for 20 miles on either side of its track, and thrifty settlers in that part of the state began to add to their holdings from these lands. I remember when my father bought railroad land at $3.50 per acre. Grasshoppers and drouth discouraged some settlers and when they had perfected titles to their land they sometimes sold it to their more securely es - tablished neighbors, preferring the fleshpots of the east to the un - certain rewards which this new country seemed to hold out to them. Centralization of land ownership has continued until now one cannot go far in any direction without passing vacant farm houses, unpainted, the windows nailed up, and usually in a sad state of decay.

' Now, if you believe with me that it is better for most people who are on the farm to remain there, and also that the best interests of our state and the nation will be best served in that way, then by what method or methods shall we proceed to hold or possibly strengthen the present ratio of rural to urban population? I appeal to you as lovers of our great country to make this question a subject of sober and prayerful consideration. To the question of whether it is better to have a few magnificent country homes or a vastly greater number of modest ones, I think there is only one answer. So much of No- </seg>

A new peril, vastly greater than excessive ownership of land by individuals, seems now to be looming upon bur horizon: I refer to corporation farming, in vogue for some time in the west and gradually working its way in our direction. I dare not enter upon an extended discussion of this new development in our agricultural world. In the December number of "Capper's Farmer" is a full page editorial by the Senator himself, directed against this gigantic scheme to centralize production and control of the country's agricultural resources. I can only quote here a brief paragraph, but if you have not read the article, I am suggesting that you get the paper and read it in its entirety. "The Kansas Farming Corporation that controls 50,000 acres operates the equivalent of 156 farms of 320 acres each. There are 156 farms upon which farm families do not live." The Senator says there are five other such corporations in the State of Kansas. Continuing, the Senator says, "It means the end of the individual farmer. It means driving him from the farm lands of America; it means denial of opportunity to rural youths to rent land and get a start towards farm ownership. It means the elimina - tion of the farm-owning farmer from our population. That is not a pleasant picture." Before concluding, I must call your attention to another very wonderful editorial. I was delighted, upon opening the "Nebraska' Farmer" issue of December 27th, to find a reproduction of an address delivered by the great Irish Poet and Economist, George Russell, during his recent visit to this country. It was by rare chance that I tuned in on Mr. Russell when he was speaking. The wealth of his thought and the enchanting beauty of his diction held me until he finished. He said: "I have been frightened as a human being by the exodus of your rural population to the cities which have sprung up so magically in half a century. In the last ten years 4,000,000 people have left the land in the United States; 19,000,000 acres have gone out of cultivation; and 76,000 farms have ceased to exist as farms." He quotes one economist as saying that only 20% of our people are now on farms. Mr. Russell pleads for a new and finer rural civiliza - tion than the world has yet known. He pleads for such wider dis - semination of all cultural agencies among rural folk as shall make their lot enviable to their cousins who dwell in the cities. His vision is not for a great manor house with vast outlying stables and lands reaching afar, but of a landscape thickly dotted with modest homes — homes whose inmates are happy because they have found the sweeter and finer things of life. I am wondering and you are wondering, "Will his dream come true?" </seg>

What are H^ some of the general trends in agriculture Si that have added to this complex problem of successful farming? The size of farm appar- I^BIKlMB^BiMBl ently is on the increase. This in turn calls for larger machinery units and, therefore, we F. D. keim have the tractor,- combine, corn picker and two and even more row machinery. Along with the advent of larger units of machinery have come from both the large and small operators alike, the demand for more modern conveniences, such as electricity, the radio, plumbing, and heating devices and bigger and better auto - mobiles. Not only does Dad have his automobile but son and daughter must have a little Henry all decorated with plate glass wind shields, removable top and gold colored bumpers. It only takes an hour to drive to the big town 40 miles away. There are some bright lights and a Talkie picture in the big town. Of course we should go to church back home in the little berg, but the hum of the motor has its call and over-rides our conscience. Besides the Jones' kids go and our kids are just as good as the Jones'. And what Is more we would have gone too when we were kids if we had had the chance. Little thought was given to the cold fact and ques - tion,-can we afford it? Hogs and cattle were worth 14c per lb., wheat $1.10 per bu., and corn 75c per bu. Many failed to think about future prices. Many a boy has entered my office last fall and told me that "he would not have purchased that car if he had known wheat would not have gone up.

It is still due and I am frank to say I hardly Bee how he is going to pay it. Now, please do not misunderstand me. I do not begrudge anyone any modern convenience or any possible good time but the fact remains that we must live within our income. In fact, we must do better than that. The old successful farmer went through a period of mighty hard work and he sacrificed many good times and conveniences in order to build up capital with which to run his business. Today he is the man that can afford the tractor and the truck, electric lights, etc. I often tell my students and farmers as well that I wish I could tell them some "presto change" affair that would eradicate our bad perennial weeds. There is no such thing. It takes time and labor and study to kill weeds and it takes time and labor and head work to build up working capital for successful farm - ing operation. Parents might I throw this statement in before I leave this phase of my discussion? Little money and hard work never hurt any boy or girl but too much money and too much leisure ruins most of them. The son of a Master Farmer came into my office not so long ago. A fine big looking boy. Somehow he looked soft, no purpose in his eye or speech. A sort of a "mamma baby boy." Good stock in him, but this thing we call social inheritance had knocked the stuffin' out of him. He might have been a master farmer but he never will become one. TWO POSSIBLE WAYS Now I am not a prophet, neither am I a pessimist but I honestly feel that we have a few years ahead of us that are going to prove rather poor scratching. I can see only two general ways of escape. One is through Increasing yields per acre on good land and seeding the poorer land to grass and then feeding these high yields of grain to livestock and the other is through the lowering of. production costs. In other words, it is a system of diversified farming and the cutting down on over head. Statistics and many practical examples have shown us that the two above mentioned remedies usually help. I spend most of my time working with plants but let me say without question I am a crops and livestock farmer. I would like to enlarge upon this subject but lack of time forces me to take up some of the trends of straight crop production and soil maintenance. The acreage of feed grains such as corn and barley is without question on the increase. Trebl barley and the smooth Awn Comfort and Glabron have been consistently giving higher yields. Carefully -prepared seedbeds for these spring grains and early seeding has proven very important Indeed. Seeding all the spring grains last of March or first of April has given higher yields at both the North Platte and Lincoln experimental stations than any later dates of seeding. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION CORN VARIETIES The increase of adapted strains of corn over our western counties and in fact the state as a whole is very encouraging. Outstanding varieties fpr eastern Nebraska are Reid's yellow dent, Pflster's Krug, St. Charles White and other well adapted home grown varieties. Care - ful selection of seed corn which always insures a good safe seed sup - ply and which has its effect not only on adaptation but on type of plant as well still remains an Important practice. As corn pickers come into more general use selection will still become more and more important because size of shank, height of ear and upright stalks are important items in this system of harvesting.

Great care should be taken if hybrid seed corn is purchased to be sure that true hybrids of good proven inbred strains are to be had. A mixture of ordinary varieties is of practically no value. Hybrid corn in the south Platte country still remains quite a question in my mind. Unless yields of 40 to 50 bushels per acre on the average can be expected I am not enthusiastic about paying from $8 to $15 per bushel for seed corn. I think hybrid seed corn deserves careful watching. If the right kind of pure lines are crossed and we have a go.od year for corn 10 to 15 per cent increase might be expected and without doubt some of the most uniform corn that any one ever grew can be found in some of these hybrid fields. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE CULTURAL PRACTICE FOR CORN I cannot pass this corn subject by, without saying a word con - cerning cultural practices. Some of you ho doubt have read this statement in the Weed bulletin or have heard some of us make it be - fore. It is estimated that weeds rob our Nebraska farmers of $2 per acre for. every tillable acre. Since we liave something like 17,000,000 tillable acres, Nebraska weeds rob us each year of $34,000,000. We. can talk all we want to about seed, hybrid corn, etc., the fact still remains that a good fertile soi.1, timely preparation and cultivation are some of the greatest factors in corn production. A field foul with weeds is sure to grow less corn than it would If the field was free of these plant food and moisture robbers. Corn is a summer annual and many weeds can be killed before the corn Is planted. Thorough disk - ing in the spring and careful listing are important. I know many farmers who are first plowing and then listing. Especially is this true where corn follows sweet clover. ALFALFA I think we could grow more alfalfa. Never plant seed the origin of which you are not sure of. Nebraska has a Northwest Alfalfa Seed Growers association, located at Crawford, Nebraska, that has some 9 or 10 carloads of hardy grown seed. You have heard that you cannot seed alfalfa back on old alfalfa land for many years and expect the usual high yields. This is true on most of our Nebraska upland soils. It is not true on sub-irrigated land or land that can be irrigated. Others say why plant alfalfa, it dries. out the soil to great depths. Suppose it does, no other field crop roots go so deep and, therefore, cannot use this water. Better plant alfalfa and use the subsoil mois - ture. Maybe it will help to pay. off the mortgage. Professor T. A. Klesselbach's "Alfalfa Investigations" Research' Bulletin No. 36 con - tains these interesting figures comparing alfalfa, corn, oats, and winter wheat yields in pounds. Alfalfa yielded 11,227 pounds per acre, corn 4,690, oats 2,180, and wheat 3,360. When we consider that good alfalfa hay is almost equal pound for pound of wheat bran, these yields become even more significant. Is it any wonder that the man who grows alfalfa usually makes some money? CERTIFIED SEED The crop growers' association whose address is the Agricultural College, Lincoln, publishes a little bulletin both spring and fall called the certified seed list. This little bulletin should be in every farmer's hands. It tells who is growing certified Nebraska 60 wheat, Burt 293 and Kherson or Nebraska 21 oats. Comfort barley, alfalfa seed, etc. Another new wheat that is showing up well for high yield and stiff straw is Nebraska 50. It Is not in the seed list this year but will probably be. in 1931. ; It seeme4o me these high yielding grains are just another link in the chain of profitable farming. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION TREATING SEED FOR SMUT Right here I might add a word concerning treatment of the small grains for smut. Each per cent of smut decreases yields about 1 per cent. Smutty grain is always cut on the market from 3 to 16 cents per bushel. Stinking smut can be controlled the easiest in wheat with copper carbonate and the loose smut of oats and barley with formalin. TJie successful farmer does not take this loss. RYE IN WHEAT The same can be said of rye in wheat. Each per cent of rye cuts the price a cent per bushel. After 10 per cent, rye wheat is sold as cereal grain. PASTURES If the trend is for more livestock on the general farm, pastures must not be forgotten. Old run down pastures are anything but an asset to the farm. Many pastures are little better than waste places. In the eastern third of the state old run down pastures. can be plowed up and temporary pastures of sweet clover, sudan grass and rye can be worked into the rotation. This of course would not be practical where the pasture comprises creek bottom land or is located on stony land. In the western two-thirds of the state it is many times difficult to seed legumes and permanent grasses. Drome grass is one of our best bets. Here it seems to me pastures should be rejuvenated rather than plowed up. Excellent results can be obtained by removing part of the stock and by turning out later in the spring. It is seldom good policy to pasture native grasses earlier than May 10th. A good barnyard corral to hold stock off the pastures until time to turn out is worth its price many times over. Most farmers should have patches of Sudan grass to relieve the permanent pastures at times during the summer. Mowing weeds, adding light top dressing of manure will sometimes work wonders with an old pasture that we think is almost gone. Sweet clover will bloat cattle at times. Some farmers are seeding rye in sweet clover pastures and then in the early summer after the sweet clover and rye are pastured down, Sudan grass is drilled into the mixture. They claim by having the grass present danger _ from sweet clover bloat is reduced to a minimum and that higher yields are obtained. SOIL FERTILITY When weather conditions are favorable will my land produce a maximum- crop, is a question that every farmer should ask himself. Too many times yields are maintained because of good machinery, more efficient tillage practices, and better adapted crops and not be - cause the soil fertility has been maintained. It is considered necessary to have a yield of 30 to 35 bushels of corn per acre in eastern Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p194">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE braska to pay for production costs when corn Is selling for 50 cents per bushel. This means that a farm which averages around a 30 bushel yield per acre is not making the grower any money. Thirty - one bushels per acre .means a profit of one bushel. Sixty bushels per acre means a profit of 20 bushels. Certain eastern Nebraska counties have adopted for their slogan "A legume with every acre of small grain." This slogan is not practical in central and western Nebraska because of lack of rainfall. Fortunately our western soils are not so badly in need of legumes. They are not eroded, leached and depleted of organic matter as badly as those of the east. From the stand - point of yields in Nebraska, organic matter in the soil is the most important factor. It affects both the chemical and physical condition of the soil. Many men tell us that on the same piece of land that they have known for 40 or 50 years, that it works so much harder now than it used to. This is because the organic content has been depleted and the soil runs together and bakes and cracks badly. Organic matter increases the efficiency of the rainfall, because a soil rich in organic matter will more readily absorb the water that falls. P. H. Stewart and D. L. Gross in connection with the 1928 corn yield con - test determined the amount of organic matter in 21 fields in eastern Nebraska; 15 of these fields gave good yields — an average of 83 bushels of corn per acre, and the amount of organic matter averaged 4.1 per cent. Six fields on the same type of soil — -several of them being along side of the better fields averaged but 3.4 per cent of organic matter and gave a yield of 25 bushels per acre. Using these as average figures, 22 per cent increase in organic matter showed an increase yield in corn of 58 bushels per acre, or 200 per cent. The maintenance of organic matter in the soil comes through growing leguminous crops, keeping the land down to grass, and intelligent use of barnyard manure. As a soil builder no crop equals sweet clover. The trend for more sweet clover is certainly favorable. In 1920 there were 30,000 acres. Today we have over 1,000,000 acres. Chris Hinz living near Blair grew in 1929, 106 bushels of corn per acre. The rotation that Mr. Hinz followed was corn, oats and sweet clover, and sweet clover pasture. In other words, corn 1 year out of 3; oats 1, and sweet clover 1. Many farmers are planting sweet clover with oats and barley and plowing up the sweet clover in the spring and later listing in corn. This certainly works best in Northeast Nebraska and even * here I think it is good practice to break up the sweet clover when it is not more than 4 or 6 inches high chiefly because of the soil moisture problem. Just what effect the trend for large farms, and larger machinery has on soil maintenance is still a question in my mind. I believe that this type of farming is much better adapted to straight grain farming than to the diversified type. It is my opinion that the straight grain farmer is sure to be the one that will suffer greatest during these times of depression. Rotations with legumes become </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION more difficult as farms and fields grow larger. The adding of manure Is almost out of the question certainly to very much of the land. CUTTING DOWN ON OVERHEAD This brings me to the last phase of the subject that I wish to discuss briefly. That is this question of overhead. Another of the trends brought out in the Nebraska Corn Yield Contest is the increas - ing efficiency of the farmer. In 1924, in eastern Nebraska, the average was 8.9 man hours per acre up to husking time to produce an acre of corn. In 1929, with a larger number of farmers competing, this average was reduced to 6.2 man hours per acre. This shows an in - creased efficiency of man power of 30 per cent in 6 years. A good part of this has been due to the increased use of larger machinery. The use of the two-row cultivators increased from 25 to 75 per cent for the contestants in this same period. It is a common thing today to see one man with a tractor and a 3 or 4-row cultivator tending two or three hundred acres of corn. I think the trend is still upward and here is where I cannot help but voice a word of caution. While we are interested in greater efficiency of unit production we do not need a greater total production. Birth control; in each of my father's and mother's families there were 12 children, in my father's family there were six, I have two, I wonder what my two kids will do; foreign supplies of grain and livestock; light silks and rayon that has taken the place of cotton and wool; consumption of gas by tractors and trucks rather than corn, oats and hay feed to horses certainly Insures us that we do not need greater total production. You have heard the old story expressing the fact that it used to take 10 sheep and 10 acres of cotton to clothe a woman for one year. Now a silk worm can do the job most any Sunday afternoon. We are living in an individualistic age. Our farming operations are becoming more and more specialized. Certain types of farming call for power machinery. Certain farmers are able to handle ma - chines much more efficiently than others. After all nothing is more important than an individual farm record. A record that actually shows loss or gain on each farming operation. Hang on to those that make you money and pass out of your business those operations that lose you money. A definite farm record is a very valuable asset. It not only gives us a chance to study our business but it gives us a chance to analyze our likes and dislikes. Three years ago my brother purchased four young mules for $250. He also had a Fordson tractor in fine repair. Today his four mules sold for $450, and the tractor isn't worth $20 on the market. Do not misunderstand me. I have no complaint with the farmer who runs a tractor and who can afford it. Most good mills will allow 30 to 35 pounds of flour or ground whole wheat for 60 pounds of wheat. Bread, butter, milk, cream, potatoes, whole wheat porridge, eggs, pork, beef, chicken, garden vegetables and fruits all produced at home </seg>
            <seg id="p196">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are sure to cut down on overhead. After all what more do we really need? I suppose it is presumptlous on my part to offer suggestions of this kind. I find myself intensely interested in the young ambitious boy or girl who has decided to be farmers and plan on starting up in this complex and expensive age. Every dollar of cash outlay that can reasonably be saved should be saved. If I were a young farmer, I would like to have a tractor, a truck, and the newest of everything. The chances are if I used old Dobbin who will eat cheap grain and hay in the summer and winter on corn stalks and . oats straw and fix up some of Dad's old tools and build up a capital stock, that ten or twenty years hence I will be Independent and happy and can then buy some newer things without having the banker in my wool every min - ute. The surprising thing about it would be that I would be happier building up this capital than if I were barely living within my income. Today we have 41 county agents, 12 home demonstration agents, around 65 Smith-Hughes agricultural teachers. 1,400 club leaders. The trend is for more of these worthy people. They are encouraging home talent plays, attempting to make boys and girls love the business they know the most about. They have a wonderful opportunity to be a real asset to the small town and the rural home. Life is what we make it, in the city or country, it makes little difference. The farm we are all interested in is one well improved, with reasonable con - veniences, soil that will grow a maximum yield of crops, the best quality of the best disease-free grains and barns and pastures filled with well bred livestock. A business like this is not found over night, it takes years and some sacrifice to develop and build it. Most of you old timers have done it and most of you young fellows will meet emergencies and troublesome times with grit and sacrifice if necessary and do it again as your fathers and mothers have done before you. THE PLACE OF LIVESTOCK ON THE FARM OF TOMORROW H. J. GRAMLICH College of Agriculture The subject assigned me is one which tempts a man to be a' prophet. A prophet is usually wrong in his forecasts and, accord - ingly, his lot is not to be desired. Some folks have been so cruel as to say that prophets are liars. A liar has been defined as a man who has no division in his brain between truth and fiction. Whether or not this is true, it must be admitted that he who attempts to talk about the future is essentially a guesser. The livestock business has ever been an important part of the world's agricultural. activities. It probably will continue in this capac - ity. It is fascinating because there is a certain uncertainty about it. Back in Biblical times Noah established a reputation. He is con- </seg>

At times during recent months some livestock men would have welcomed a flood of such proportions as to entirely remove their charges from them. The plight of the sheep men last spring whose lots were filled with fat lambs possessing a market value of 9c per pound and an initial cost of 13c is representative of one of our most distressing examples. During mid-summer both thin and fat cattle sold at exceedingly low prices and unquestionably there were many fortunes dissipated in the span of a few weeks' time. During such intervals we sometimes feel that the livestock business is like the penitentiary and the banking business in that all look better from the outside than from within. 70% OP INCOME THRU LIVESTOCK In spite of the mediocre aspect of the present and immediate past, there can be no denying that livestock must continue to constitute an Important part of the farm operations. While not absolutely necessary In the production of large crops, they are essential in the consumption ■Han MbI^^ ! Livestock will be as Important tomorrow as they are today. of them. State Statistician A. E. Anderson has recently released some statistics which show that the farmers of Nebrask are receiving 70% of their cash Income thru the sales of livestock and livestock products. A great deal of the other 30% comes from the sale of grains and roughages which are to be fed to livestock ultimately. A few years ago it seemed that we might reach a time when there would be a shortage of food for humans and It would be necessary to curtail the </seg>
            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE i&gt;Licuing of farm animals in order that more of the cereals be used in the preparation of human foods and only the coarser by-products be available for livestock feeding. There was quite a group of persons who felt that this might be true in the near future. As the matter stands today, we find a rather drastic trend the other way. We have a tremendous over-production of grains. If the corn, wheat, oats, and barley produced in the world In 1930 were to be used exclusively for human consumption, there would be an ample supply to carry thru a five-year period, even tho the tillers of the soil were' not to seed an acre during that time. Animals produce concentrated products. The average fattening domestic animal utilizes from five to ten pounds of grain and hay in producing one pound of increased body weight. This is an uneco - nomical procedure but, seemingly, one which is essential in order to keep the proper balance between supply and demand of food products. The human race needs meat in the diet — not too much, to be sure, but a well-balanced ration produces people of the stamp and stamina to carry on this world's activities upon a high plane. Races which have tried to subsist entirely upon vegetarian diets have been dwarfed both physically and mentally to a point where they play but a minor part in supplying the creative genius of the universe. Instead of finding fault with farm animals, we should be thankful that they are avail - able to help carry out our agricultural scheme. MUST MEET MARKET DEMANDS There is a possibility that in the future animals will not be finished as highly as in the past. In fact, there is a rather marked trend in demands toward meat produced by such animals. A customer went to the meat shop in a town of 5,000 recently and asked for a good T-bone steak. The butcher was unable to show him one but did ex - pose the loin of a medium animal and offer to cut one from it. The customer interrogated, "Is that the best meat you can buy?" The retailer replied, "No, but it is the best I can sell." Unquestionably this is typical of a condition existent in many towns throughout the United States. If this becomes a general condition, it is possible that beef making will be hinged pretty closely around the' liberal use of farm roughages and the limited use of grain. Should this be the case, there is no question but what the corn plant will be one of the first to be drawn into the picture. Year after year we have permitted thousands of tons of good forage to be wasted thru exposure to the elements. The corn plant can be preserved either thru the silo or in the form of fodder and made to furnish a tremendous amount of feed for livestock. Nebraska people have been prone to scoff at silos even tho their merits have been extolled throughout the past quarter of a century. The advent of the simple, inexpensive, yet highly efficient trench silo is going to do more toward popularizing silage than any one other agency. There is seldom a year but what. at least one field </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION of corn on the average farm is disappointing. This has very ume value unless cut and preserved. By turning gopher for a few days one can very easily build a trench silo of sufficient capacity to house feed for the livestock of the farm. In many Instances having such feed will enable one to purchase additional animals. Not infrequently cattle can be carried thru the winter on such ration and Bold the fol - lowing spring as feeders or as stockers to those who have grass to run stock upon. I nrmly believe that the future holds much in store for the man who can adapt his farming operations to include this as one of the features. Our agronomy friends have always advocated crop rotations. The liberal use of rotations involves the production of considerable rough - age of both a leguminous and non-leguminous nature. To get value from this, livestock must be available. Domestic animals offer a medium of exchange to the farmers of today and tomorrow. They serve practically the same functions as that served by the beads of the red man. The .bulky, non-merchantable roughages, as well as a large percentage of the grains produced by and the property of the farmer, must be processed thru the farm animal which, in turn, is sold for cash and eventually pays the gas bills and buys new radios. It would be folly for me to go into detail on this subject. If I were to do so, it would be largely based upon occurrences of the past. A wag has ventured the statement that what you learn one year makes a fool out of you the next. I guess we must admit that there is con - siderable truth to this. . With the advent during recent years of a tremendous volume of free advice for the tiller of the soil, we have heard that it is necessary for the farmer to be both intelligent and smart. He must be intelligent enough to absorb the advice offered by his city cousins and smart enough to use only that which will do him the least harm. I do feel safe in making the prediction that livestock will play fully as important a part on the farm of tomorrow as on the farm of yesterday. The' man who succeeds in producing his animals most economically and in fattening them with the least expense is the one who will be able to survive the lean years which are bound to develop on the horizon at more or less frequent intervals. </seg>

The certification committee of the Nebraska College of Agriculture has specified the following rules and standards to govern the production and certification of small grain and flax for 1931. 1. Varieties Eligible for Cert mention. The varieties of small grain eligible for state certification shall be Kanred, Cheyenne, and Nebraska 60 winter wheat; Ceres and Marquis spring wheat; Nebraska 21, Burt 293 and Kanota oats; Glabron, Comfort, Trebi and Velvet barley; and Rosen rye. Flax varieties eligible for certification shall be Bison, Buda, and N. D. 114. 2. Sources of Seed. Fields to be eligible for certification must have been sown to seed which came directly from the Nebraska College of Agriculture or sub - stations thereof, or from similar institutions in other states; or from seed which was certified by a recognized Crop Improvement Associa - tion the previous year. Because of the danger of mixing thru volunteer grains, certified fields of fall grains cannot be grown on land which during the previous season was in other varieties or in uncertified seed of the same kind of crops. Rosen rye fields must be at least one-fourth mile from other rye fields or fields of wheat Infested with rye due to the danger of cross pollination. 8. Disqualifications. Fields for the production of certified seed must be cut and handled as separate and distinct fields apart from any other small grain crops or varieties. Fields of grain which are questionable as to volunteer crops, mixing in cutting, or identity of variety or which are seriously Infected with seed borne diseases other than those mentioned In rule .6 shall not be certified. 4. Inspectors. Persons employed as field inspectors for small grain certification work must be approved by the certification committee of the Nebraska College of Agriculture. 5. Field Inspections. Field inspections of small grain' must be made just prior to har - vest. The inspector shall traverse the field sufficiently to determine accurately the condition of the field as to purity, diseases, and weeds. </seg>

All certified seed shipped in sacks shall be labelled with a Nebraska state certified small grain tag properly filled out. When delivered in bulk, a properly filled in tag shall be displayed on the grain bin and a properly filled out sales card shall be given the buyer. 11. Certificates of Certification. Upon receipt of the threshed grain sample and its inspection and analysis, a certificate for each crop variety that has met the standards for certification shall be sent the grower. This certificate shall state the crop variety, acreage, color, test weight, diseases, and purity of the crop as found in the field and threshed grain inspections. 12. Seed List. There shall be printed annually a fall and spring seed list giving the names of growers of certified crops or growers of seed in the pro - cess of certification. Information shall be given as to the amount of seed available, purity, diseases and quality in so far as the information is available. ADMINISTRATIVE RULES OP THE NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS ASSOCIATION Under the new certified seed law of the state of Nebraska, the Dean of the College of Agriculture, University of Nebraska, has ap - pointed the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association as the official agency for the certification of small grain and flax. The Nebraska Crop Growers 1 Association has set up the following regulations. 13. Memberships. Applicants for certification must be members of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. The memberhlp fee is 11.00 which en - titles one to a copy of the printed annual report of the association and other membership privileges. 14. Fees for Inspection. An inspection fee of $3.00 per individual will be charged regard - less of the number of fields and varieties provided they are all on one farm. Checks for this amount must accompany the applications. In case of hail storms, drought, or other unfavorable crop conditions, or in case the field cannot qualify, the application may be withdrawn and the fee returned providing the Inspector has not left the secretary's office for that county. In addition to this certification fee, a sales tax of 2 per cent of the total value of the certified seed sold for seeding purposes shall be levied by the association. The grower must accom- </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION pany such a fee with a list of the parties to whom he sold seed. The funds raised by the sales tax shall be used for the purpose of adver - tising the seed, carrying on certification work and for the general pro - motion of the certified seed work. 15. Applications. All applications should be in by June 1 and the association re - erves the right to refuse those reaching the office after June 15. All applications must be of official application blanks which will be sup - plied by the association. See your county agricultural agent for blanks and plans for certification or write direct to the Nebraska Crop Grow - ers' Association, Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska. I ■ " 16. Field Inspected List. A preliminary seed list known as'the "Field Inspected Seed List," listing those who passed the field inspection, will be printed immed - iately after the inspections are completed. This is to supply the early call for seed before the threshed samples are available for final cer - tification. 17. Threshed Samples. Representative threshed samples of a gallon of seed should be sent to the Secretary just as soon as possible after threshing. This is im - portant and necessary. The certified seed list will be published as soon as the threshed samples are in. 18. Board of Review. A Board of Review, consisting of five members appointed by the President of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, shall pass on field and threshed grain Inspection reports. Under authority granted by the Nebraska certified seed law, the association may refuse certifi - cation privileges to those found guilty of dishonest fraudulent prac - tices in growing or selling certified small grain or in fraudulently submitting better samples as representative lots than are actually de - livered to customers buying such seed. 1O. Small Grain Show. All threshed samples supplied for Inspection will be automatically entered in the Utility Small Grain Show of the Association held in Lincoln during Organized Agriculture. </seg>

Magee In the auditorium of the Dairy Building. Dr. P. D. Kelm presented the following resolution regarding the death of Chas. Grau. "In the passing of Chas. Grau at his home in Bennington, Dec. T2, 1930, the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association and Nebraka Agri - culture lost a loyal friend and a most willing worker. Mr. Grau was a member of this association from Its beginning. He was a member of the State Board of Agriculture from 1925 until his death and for many years was a very active member of the Douglas county agricul - tural society. He was superintendent of the Class F (Soil products) at the State Fair from 1925 to 1929. He was an active member of the Farmers Union and member of the board of the Farmers Educa - tional Union and Farmers Union State Exchange. He was chairman of the Board of the Sioux City branch of the Farmers Union Live Stock Commission Company at the time of his death. Mr. Grau was greatly Interested In corn and he did much to arouse and to maintain an Interest in the improvement and production of this crop. Agri - culture has lost a distinguished leader in the death of Mr. Grau. The memory of him and the results of his useful life will live on. Whereas Nebraska has lost one of Its agricultural leaders In the passing of Chas. Grau, be it resolved that the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association go on record as expressing, to whom it may concern, our appreciation of the work of this good man. The Association regrets exceedingly the loss of Mr. Grau and wishes to express to Mrs. Chas. Grau and to his sons and daughters our heart felt sympathy. (Signed) F: D. KEIM, J. D. REAM, BERT MOTT, .

Magee reported that the question of revising the consti - tution of the Association had come up at a previous meeting and that a committee had been appointed to formulate a new constitution to be presented at the annual meeting. He explained that the association had been acting under a constitution 21 years old which no longer covered all of the activities of the organization. He also pointed out that an election of an entire new set of officers at any one annual election afforded an opportunity for a complete change in the organ- </seg>

He further pointed out that a notice of the adoption of a new constitution had been given to the membership so that the matter might be considered. He asked that the proposed constitution and by-laws be presented for consid - eration. Mr. Stewart reported for the committee and upon motion the new by-lays and constitution were adopted. This constitution and by-laws is printed at the close of the 1931 report. The president called for a report from the nominations committee consisting of D. L. Gross, Floyd Wetzel and Carl Schweser. Mr. Schweser reported for the committee, nominating as provided in the new constitution, Carl Day from district one, A. H. Blermann from district three, and Bert Mott from district five. The present secretary-treasurer P. H. Stewart was nominated. Upon motion by Mr. Gross, the by-laws were suspended and the officers elected by acclamation. The officers nom - inated were declared elected. Mr. Magee brought up the idea of electing outstanding men as honorary members and appointed a committee of Dr. F. D. Keim, Bert Mott and Bert Miller to consider the matter, and report just previous to adjournment at noon. Dr. F. D. Keim moved that the board of directors in making the budget consider allowing $150 for the College Crops Judging Team which represents the institution at Kansas City. The motion was sec - onded and carried. Mr. Keim reported for the honorary membership committee as follows: "It is the opinion of this committee that any prospective hon - orary member should be considered at least for one year' before any selection Is -made. Since this is impossible during this session the committee favors no action at this time." The treasurer's report of the funds In the association treasury and that provided by the appropriation thru the State Board of Agri - culture was given. These reports are printed in full in the 1931 annual report. Upon motion, these reports were adopted following the reports by the auditing committee consisting of T. H. Goodding, Chairman, and H. L. Wahlgren. Meeting adjourned. P. H. STEWART, Secretary. </seg>

Mr. Biermann gave a report on the 1930 Chicago exhibit, stating that comments on the Nebraska exhibit were very favorable because of Its simplicity and attractiveness. Moved by Dietz and seconded by Mott that we express our appre - ciation to the Greater Omaha Association for funds contributed towards the Crop Growers' exhibit at Chicago. Carried. Secretary Stewart then reported that funds amounting to $200 made available by the Association for the College and 4-H crops judg - ing teams had been paid. He also reported that due to the lack of interest among the county agents, the contest prizes based on the crops and soils programs in the various counties had not been awarded. It was moved by Wahlgren and seconded by "Biermann that this award be discontinued. Motion carried. A report on the finances for the current year was given which showed that $400 remained unexpended in the Association appropria - tion. It was moved by Mott and seconded by Ebers that the usual sup - port be given the College and 4-H crops. judging teams. Motion was carried. There was some discussion regarding the success of the January show with particular emphasis on the market corn class, consisting of field run samples of shelled corn taken from the fields of those entered in the 1930 Corn Yield Contest. Stewart reported that this show was very well received and many favorable comments were heard. It was moved by Biermann and seconded by Wahlgren that the market corn class be continued foY the 1932 show: Df. Kiessel - bach, who was one of the judges of the show, reported that purity was one of the main deciding factors in placing the samples, bringing out that mixed corn was at a decided disadvantage. The meeting was then adjourned for lunch. During the lunch hour, Mr. Jackson, Brokaw, and Burr were called upon . for remarks. Mr. Jackson complimented the Association very highly on the type of report which they put out each year and in the efficient manner in which the funds made available to the As - sociation had been expended. He also discussed briefly the proposed . Nebraska exhibit for the World's Fair at Chicago. In 1933. Mr. Brokaw expressed his appreciation of the co-operation which the Crop Growers' Association are giving towards agricultural extension work. He remarked that members of the Association could be of great help to the extension program and Indicated that they would be called upon more and more for help in this regard. Dean Burr reported on the progress of legislation pertaining to certified seed and brought out the Importance of the College of Agriculture maintaining an impartial stand toward all organizations. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It was suggested that Indian names or perhaps town or county names could be given to new varieties developed In Nebraska. Names which are particularly descriptive of the new varieties were especially recommended. It was suggested that prizes be given for new names submitted for Nebraska No. 50 wheat. The members ot the Associa - tion were urged to submit names. The matter of varieties to be certified during the coming year was taken up. It was decided to retain all varieties which were on the 1930 list and to add Nebraska No. 50 (Cheyenne) wheat, 480 bushels of which was distributed to 38 farmers and will be eligible for certification during 1931. It was moved by Ebers and seconded by Mott that the above suggestions be carried out. The motion was carried. The matter of the Board of Review or Certification Board was next taken up and President Magee appointed the following: P. H. Stewart. Dr. T. A. Kiesselbach, Herman Ebers, and H. L. Wahlgren. The matter of obtaining from the certified seed growers, the actual yields per acre and the amount of seed for sale was discussed. It was agreed that a blank should be sent to the certified seed growers after harvest and a report obtained from them as to the actual yield so that the correct amount of seed produced by the grower might be included in the certified seed list. The matter of prices for certified seed was discussed but it was brought out that these could not be arbitrarily set since the condi - tions varied so much for the different growers. It was agreed that all seed should be recleaned before sold and that certain amounts above market price would be a good way of stating the price of cer - tified seed. The new rule requiring that one variety of a particular crop be grown on a farm where certification is requested came up for considerable discussion. It was pointed out by Mr. Ebers that there was as much danger in mixing between farms as there was on any particular farm, and that from his standpoint since he was in the cer - tified seed growing business he thought that a certified seed grower should be allowed to grow more than one variety. The general senti - ment seemed to be that this rule might be left out of the requirements. No definite action was taken, however. In view of the fact that the Association Is constantly in need of good clear-cut pictures for the annual report, the question of securing a camera was brought up. The sentiment toward this was very fav - orable and it was moved by Dietz and seconded by Ebers that a Graflex camera be purchased, leaving the choice of this and also the price to be paid to the secretary-treasurer. The motion was carried-. President Magee brought out the question of succession in office in case there were vacancies, pointing out that it was possible he might be called to other work which would prevent him from serving as president. He also pointed out that the constitution and by-laws do </seg>

Only those who completed in the 1930 corn yield contest were eligible to enter. The entries consisted of a peck of shelled corn taken from the 20-pound field run samples, which were taken from the field at the time yields were determined. This show attracted unusual interest, and many favorable comments were made by those in attendance. The. samples were judged entirely from the market standpoint being placed by H. E. Nelson, Chief of Federal Grain Inspection for Ne - braska, T. A. Klesselbach of the Agricultural College, and Mr. Crit - tenden, of the Crittenden Grain Co., of Lincoln. Moisture, test weight, freedom from mixture and general quality were the deciding factors The samples were divided into four classes, being grouped according to region from which they came. Those from each region, as pro- </seg>

MEETING - Held in the Dairy Building Nebraska State Agricultural College Auditorium LINCOLN. NEBRASKA Wednesday, January 7, 1931 PRESIDENT M. N. LAWRITSON, Lincoln SECRETARY L. K. CROWE, Lincoln MR. M. N. LAWRITSON: Before we take up the program proper this afternoon, I am at this time going to appoint some committees. Any organization that does business necessarily must have committees functioning. I am going to appoint these committees now and want them to draw up resolutions and suggestions during the afternoon so that they may be presented before the business meeting later in the program. The committees are as follows: Nominating Committee Fred Egger, Chairman Ralph Fortna Sumner Barnell Resolution Committee H. A. Gordon, Chairman C. E. Olmsted E. C. Scheldenhelm The chairman of these committees will please be ready to report when we open the business session. Inasmuch as we are a little late in starting, we are going to do away with the first part of the program which calls for the President's address. We have speakers here this afternoon of national repute who can utilize this time to a much better advantage. However, it will be well for us to pause to hear the Secretary's report. The officer of this organization that really has the work to do Is' the Secretary, and I am going to ask him to give us briefly some of the activities of the association during the past year. </seg>
            <seg id="p252">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE So at this time I am going to ask Mr. L. K. Crowe to give his report. Mr. Crowe. ■ ■ MR. CROWE: Just one word before I gave my report. You will notice displayed around the room cards on which are the names or owners of 300 pound herds. If you see any errors in those cards, in address, breeds, or spelling of names, please call our attention to it. The medals will be engraved and the certificates made out according to the material contained on those cards. Three or four more names should be on the Custer County Association card and a few more names for the State Board of Control arrived too late to be recorded. Aside from that, I think they are complete. My report is as follows: I wish to outline for you the major projects of this association. I feel justified in doing this because I am convinced that all of you are not aware of its varied activities. A brief review of the activities of the association during the past year will be typical of the work for any one year. The association started the year with the annual judging contest, on Wednesday morning of Organized Agriculture week. There were 132 students, 22 breeders, 5 cow testers and 5 asso - ciation teams competing for high honors. The judges for this contest were representatives of the National Breed Associations. It has always been the aim of the association to have speakers of national importance at the Wednesday afternoon meeting and last year was no exception, with O. E. Reed, Chief of the Dairy Bureau. United States Department of Agriculture; Lewis W. Morley of the American Jersey Cattle Club; and S. SI. Salisbury, Professor of Animal Husbandry of the Ohio State University. A group of approximately 200 men and women interested in dairying were present to hear these speakers and went away with a clearer conception of the importance of the industry. Thursday evening of Organized Agriculture week was the first strictly Dairy Banquet that had been held for several years. The success of this banquet was complete if we judge by the actions of the 193 people who attended and by the comments that we have heard since then. The first part of the banquet program was devoted to some of the lighter things of life with Earl J. Cooper of the Holstein- Friesian Association very ably presiding as Toastmaster. The last part of the program was given over to the presentation of trophies and awards. One hundred and nine gold, silver, ana bronze medals were pre - sented to members of Dairy Herd Improvement Associations in recog - nition of the high production they had attained with their herds, or this number: A gold medal was presented to the owner of the highest produc - ing herd. </seg>
            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION A silver medal was. presented to the owner of the second highest producing herd. A silver plaque was presented to the owner of the herd with an average production of more than 400 pounds of buttert'at for live suc - cessive years. This was the first of these plaques to be presented by the association. Six silver medals were presented to owners of herds of ten or more cows with production in excess of 450 pounds of butter fat. One hundred thirty-two certificates of production were presented to owners of herds of. less than eight cows or who had previously received a medal, but whose production was again over 300 pounds. In addition to these individual awards a trophy cup was presented to the association with the highest average butterfat production for the year. The results of the judging contest held on Wednesday morning were announced and the following awards were made: A gold, two silver, and two bronze medals for the five high placings in student's section. A gold, two silver, and two bronze medals for the five high placings in breeder's section. A trophy cup for the high Dairy Herd Improvement Association team. A silver and a bronze medal for first and second place in the tester's section. We now proceed to April of 1930, the time of the annual high school judging contest held at the college and which is sponsored by this association in that a silver and two bronze medals are awarded to the three high individuals in the judging of dairy cattle, judging dairy products and Babcock testing as well as a trophy cup for the high school having the highest ranking dairy cattle judging team. A like number of medals are furnished for the contest held at North Platte. Let us turn to another side of the work of the association, that of preparation and display of exhibits. Each year exhibits are pre - pared by the association for display at county fairs. Such exhibits could be found at thirty county fairs this last year, due to the excellent work of your Assistant Secretary, Mr. C. W. Nibler. An exhibit cover - ing about 80 feet of -wall space was prepared and displayed at the State Fair and all of this exhibit was displayed at the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show. A new feature was started this year in that the associa - tion raised the funds and managed the erection of the butter statue at the State Fair at the request of Secretary George Jackson. Many </seg>
            <seg id="p254">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD. OF AGRICULTURE small exhibits were furnished throughout the year to local organiza - tions wishing to advertise dairying. Lincoln dairy plants, as well as those out in the state, have come to look upon the association as a source of this material. Two of your Board of Directors served as Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent of Dairy. Cattle at the Nebraska State Fair, and two served in like capacity at the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show. A com - mittee appointed by your president has worked with a committee from the Nebraska Dairy Development Society in requesting the State Board of Control to use butter in state institutions. This matter will come up at this meeting of the Legislature, and if you wish to Improve the market of dairy products, do not hesitate to advise the legislator from your district of your wishes. Your association furnished part of the expenses of the champion ,4-H Club dairy judging team that they might compete with other state champions at the National Dairy Show. An appropriation was also made from the association funds to help defray the expenses of the University of Nebraska dairy cattle judging team at the Dairy Cattle Congress and at the National Dairy Show, and the dairy products Judg - ing team at the National Dairy Industries Exposition. I do not know that I have covered all of the activities of the association, but I have covered enough to show you that you have an active organization. The plans for today's meeting and for our ban - quet Thursday evening are made and I do not believe they indicate that there is any declining in the quality of programs to be presented. The "association can probably carry on a program such as was carried on last year for as many years as our small appropriation from the State Board of Agriculture continues. However, let it be under - stood that there can be no expansion in this program unless you lend your help and support. An organization cannot stand still, it must progress or go backwards. Each year we have- carried a larger pro - gram than the preceding year. It is 'in your hands as to the direction in which your association will go. Your cooperation thru your mem - berships and support will assure the progress of the association. I do not believe we have a member of the association who has ever regretted having invested one dollar in it, and it is an investment. Then let me leave Just this word with you, attend the meeting today, hear these speakers of national reputation, and attend the banquet tomorrow evening. Then, before you go, hand a dollar to Professor Davis, Mr. Flack, Mr. Lawritson, Mr. Nibler, Mr. Scheldenhelm, or even to me, and your membership card will be Bent to you. MR. LAWRITSON: I believe after listening to our Secretary's report, you will agree that this association has been fairly active in the interest of better dairying thruoat the state. We want you folks </seg>
            <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION to feel that this is your organization. Those of us who functiuu as officers and work on committees are merely your servants in this organization. The way to build the organization up is to increase its membership. We need more members. By taking a membership in this association, you are entitled to all its benefits and to receive a copy of the report of the proceedings of this meeting containing the addresses and talks given before the association and that alone Is well worth the membership fee. As Mr. Crowe said, the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association has a reputation of always, having good programs. We always have men of authority in their field on our program each year, and this year Is no exception. I think our pro - gram committee has been very fortunate in securing men of the type that we have on the program this year. Along the line of Dairy Asso - ciation membership, Mr. Crowe has said that a number of people have been talking about joining the association, but it has not gotten as far as paying the membership fee and actually joining the association. We can illustrate this by a story: • A farmer sent his hired man out to do the chores. When he came in, the farmer asked him how he got along with the work. He did not reply, bo the farmer decided to ask him some specific ques - tions. So he asked: "Did you feed the horses?" The man answered, "Yes, I fed them hay." "Did you feed the cows?" "Yes, I fed them hay." "Did you feed the ducks?" "Yes, I fed them hay." "Did they eat the hay?" "No, but they were still talking about it when I left." This can apply to our case, In that you talk a lot about taking a membership in the association, but you do not carry it out to the extent of paying your membership dues. The first speaker on our program is Mr. Earl J. Cooper, Director of Extension Service of the Holsteln-Frlesian Association, who is going to address us on the subject of "Dairying In Latin America." Before Mr. Cooper begins his address, Mr. H. B. Muffly, attorney for the State Association for Cooperative Creameries, has an announcement to make. MR. MUFFLY: Mr. President, members of the association, and friends: I am merely. an attorney for the State Association for Cooperative Creameries. When it was mentioned that there was .a bill before the Legislature requiring the use of butter in state Institutions, 1 just wanted to say that that bill has already been drafted and a good Democrat and Republican have had their names on it and it is ready to be Introduced. It will be the first bill Introduced to the Legislature. It will require the State Board of Control to buy butter for the state Institutions and to prevent them from buying butter substitutes. It will be appreciated If everyone of you will get In touch with any of the members of the Legislature with whom you happen to be ac- </seg>
            <seg id="p256">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE quainted, or any legislator who represents your district and urge him to pass this bill. W.e are working on another bill that will be intro - duced shortly. It will provide a tax on butter substitutes. Thank you. MR. LAWRITSON: I am sure we appreciate this information, Mr. Muffly. A year ago the Board of Directors appointed a committee to work with a similar committee from the Nebraska Dairy Development Society and appear before the State Board of Control, to ask that no butter substitutes be used, and ask them to help in getting money ap - propriated for buying butter instead of butter substitutes. They agreed that they would be glad to work with the committee and try to get money appropriated for this purpose. We are very glad to learn that such a bill is being prepared. The first speaker on our program this afternoon is Mr. Earl J. Cooper, Director of the Extension Service of the Holstein-Kriesian Asso - ciation. To those of you who were at the banquet last year, Mr. Cooper needs no introduction, for he acted as toastmaster. He is to talk today about his trip to Latin America. This subject was covered in an article in the Holsteln-Friesian World but I am sure it would be more interesting to hear it from him directly. Mr. Cooper. MR. COOPER: My trip to Costa Rica was most interesting and I trust it will prove to be a profitable one through the many contacts made not only with the Government and agricultural leaders of that Republic, but also through many friendships effected with agricul - tural leaders of other Central American Republics. Costa Rica, which in the language of the Spanish means "Rich Coast", is about the size of West Virginia and is located just north of Panama and south of Nicaragua. It is bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and on the west by the Pacific. From an agricultural standpoint, it is perhaps the most advanced of all the Central American Republics. The climate varies according to location, the lowland climate being tropical and the upland climate being very similar to the summers of our Middle West. The people of Costa Rica are of a very progressive type and extremely anxious to improve their livestock and general agricultural conditions. For years they have endeavored to establish the first National Livestock Exposition and realized this ambition on the open - ing day, March 29th. A very complete set of buildings were arranged and comparable to the buildings at some of our larger county ex - positions. In order that the readers of this article may see the country some - what as I observed it, I will relate my entire trip in a narrative form, endeavoring to touch upon the important features of the Exposition and my observations of the country. </seg>
            <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION I left Chicago, Illinois, on March 20th and spent the 2V» u, t the University of Louisiana where I gained valuable information re - garding the shipping regulations and other important facts to be borne in mind in sending cattle from the United States to Central and South America. I must say at this point that the University of Louisiana has developed two splendid herds of cattle, one of the Holstein-Frieslan breed, the other of the Jersey breed. All around Baton Rouge I ob - served good herds of cattle of both of these breeds and was told that there are many good herds scattered out over Louisiana. I sailed on March 21st from New Orleans on the United Fruit Boat "Castilla", a combination freight and passenger boat. En route with me on the entire trip was one pen of bronze turkeys and one prize rooster, all headed for the Exposition in Costa Rica. All of us arrived safely at Port Limon on the morning of March 28th. Eh route from Cristobal,- the American city in the Panama Zone, I met delegates from Panama all headed toward San Jose. Before the boat docked on the morning of the 28th, I was met by a Government representative and presented with the courtesy of port. The delegation from Panama and myself were then taken to a special train which departed one hour later toward San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. During the intervening hour, we were escorted over Limon which is the east port of the Republic and from which the United Fruit Company operates. It is from this port that millions of dollars of bananas, coffee, cocoa beans and other tropical products are loaded for the United States and for Europe. Our train left Limon about 10:00 o'clock in the morning and for the next, two hours we traveled through what is known as the "banana belt". From both sides of the train, we saw the bananas growing in their natural state, which is upside down, and being carted in by a small type of mule from the banana plantations. Where the mule was not available, the negroes, who spoke a mixture of Engllish and Spanish, could be seen carrying in huge bunches on their heads. At the end of about two hours the climate changed somewhat to de - cidedly cooler. We were. then in the coffee plantations, coffee being a very important product of Costa Rica, and I was told that it was of the highest quality produced. As the small train climbed upward, we passed from the coffee belt into the cocoa bean section. We were told that we were now leaving the tropical part of Costa Rica and ascending more to the agricultural regions. This was evident by thp fact that we saw very few colored people and very few English bill - boards. Instead, advertisements began to appear in Spanish and the people were either white or showed evidence of being of Indian descent. The little engine was chugging along at a good rate, however, and seemed to climb with a remarkable rate of speed up the steep grades. The vegetation was no longer tropical but looked very much </seg>
            <seg id="p258">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE like what we might see in our own mountains. Tunnels, high bridges, gulches and high mountain peaks provided a scenic view the like or which I have never witnessed. The natives seemed to be farming their little places almost straight up and down and the oxen, carrying the blood of most of our dairy breeds* added to the many unique fea - tures of the trip. At 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon we stopped at Cartago and at about 4:00 arrived in San Jose, a typical Spanish city of about 60,000 population. During the last hour of the ride, we were in a very good agricultural country and the familiar sight of dairy cattle of the Guernsey, Jersey and Holstein breeds greeted my eyes. The Exposition at Cartago On the morning of March 29th 1 was met by Mr. B. R. Yglesias, Director of the College of Agriculture of Costa Rica. Prom San Jose, we drove to Cartago where the Exposition was about to open its doors with an inaugural address by the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Arturo Volio. Cartago is the ancient capital of Costa Rica and is located at the foot of the great volcano Irazu. The city has been destroyed by earthquake and volcano four times, the last destruction being in 1910. In spite of these handicaps, however, the inhabitants have repeatedly rebuilt the city, each time a little better than before. Like San Jose, the present capital, it is typically Spanish with beautiful cathedrals and parks. M ,..;; On entering the Exposition building, I was greatly surprised to see {he large number of apparently excellent animals of the Guernsey, Jersey, Ayrshire and Holstein breeds. Nearly all animals were pre - sented- in good show shape and properly labeled. While the names, of. course, were In Spanish, I Could readily recognize the breeding of several of our very good herds in the United States. The thing that struck me at once was the large size attained by these animals, very noticeable among the Jerseys. After the visit of the President of the Republic, the Exposition was formally launched by the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Volio, following which the judging of cattle com - menced. The first classes taken were the Ayrshires, all owned by the Director of the- College of Agriculture, Mr. Yglesias. These animals had been- imported • within the last few years from one of our large eastern herds and had given very satisfactory results in a new coun - try. The imported sires had been used on many of the native cattle and inasmuch as grades were included in the Exposition, a wonderful opportunity was given me to discuss the value of the purebred sire. This of necessity was rather slow work as I had to talk through the medium of an interpreter. However, the people stood by for three days of Judging and seemed to understand very well what I was trying </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION to tell them. Quite a number of questions were asked from day to day about the placings and they were all fair and Intelligent questions. I hope my answers were satisfactory. On the afternoon of March 29th I judged the Uolsteins, about 30 in number. As I have said before, there were some very good animals, both purebreds and grades, and it Is remarkable what pure - bred sires have done in just a few years in building up good herds. Like the Ayrshires, I found that the Holsteins had been imported from some of our American herds, the most of them perhaps from the Carnation Milk Farms. The grand champion bull of the Uolstein breed was of the "Matador" strain, a good type Individual, weighing about 3,000 pounds. His offspring were very creditable, both pure - breds and grades. I judged one of the best grade Holsteln cows I have ever seen and the grand champion purebred Holstein, a senior yearling, would have been a credit to any' of our state fair expositions. Holstein judging was finished up the morning of the second day and followed by Guernseys. I found the Guernsey breeding descended from two well known herds, one located in California and the other in New York State. Otto, the Herdsman, and "Jimmy" Dodge, both well known in the United States, seemed also to have very many friends among, the Guernsey breeders of Costa Rica. The Guernsey bulls were a very good lot and a real credit to the breed. The grand champion Guernsey bull would, in my opinion, also have looked mighty good at most of bur state fairs and would probably have been within the money at the National. The predominating blood of the dairy cattle in Costa Rica ap - peared to be the Jersey. I was told that they* had been imported sev - eral years before the other breeds. Most of them had attained con - siderable size over the Jerseys in the United States, being, I would say, on the average, 200 pounds heavier. The grand champion bull is the son of the World's champion Jersey cow and his sons and daugh - ters have been scattered quite widely over the Cartago country. I found several good Jersey females — the grand champion being, 1 thought, exceptionally high class. The judging occupied about three days time. I lectured on each class of animals and gave several demonstrations on fitting and show - ing. Hundreds of questions were asked about feeding and breeding. I have never seen a group of people more eager to learn about the dairy business.' The farmers proved to be very intelligent people. On the third day of judging they led their animals in and placed them nearly correct in every class. After my first talk oh handling of ani - mals In the show ring, It was a common sight to see from two to ten of the farmers leading their animals around the show building and endeavoring to train them to stand better In the ring. </seg>
            <seg id="p260">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a here were many thousands of people at the show during the three days. They came apparently with the main purpose of viewing the livestock and watching the judging. At the close of each after - noon's judging a typical Spanish bullfight was staged with the excep - tion that the bull always came out alive. Several meetings were held with livestock men and a great many conferences arranged with not only Government officials and breeders of Costa Rica but with agri - cultural representatives from Honduras, Panama 'and South American Republics. Many of these people appeared to be interested in pur - chasing cattle in the future and all were supplied with the names and addresses of the breed secretaries of our various organizations. As the agriculture develops in Costa Rica and as the feed is supplied, I thoroughly believe that there will be a great deal of dairy develop - ment. The Cooperation of the Newspapers of Costa Kica Such help as I may have been able to give to the people of Costa Rica was, without question, made of double value through the co - operation of all of the newspapers of the Republic, especially "The Tribune" and "The Costa Rica Daily", both published in San Jose. Many pages were devoted to my work during the week, including the judging of cattle and other livestock events in which I took part, In describing the classes at the Show, every word I gave in regard to the animals and my reasons for placing was printed and I was asked to give them a number of interviews about selection, feeding, breeding and general care of dairy animals. These newspapers had a wide distribution over the Republic and will undoubtedly have a great effect in improving the agricultural con - ditions of Costa Rica. Even as this is written, two weeks after re - turning home, I am receiving newspapers which are still giving space to the Show. This all points to the sincerity of our Costa Rican friends in their desire to become much better acquainted with better dairy methods. A special magazine was printed from Cartago giving an entire review of the Exposition. This magazine had wide circulation over the Latin American Republics. The Milk Supply of Costa Rica I hope I was successful in my attempts to impress upon the people the value of milk as a food. During the judging period I took a number of opportunities to describe the good effects of drinking milk. The retailers in the Latin American Republics realize that they should increase the consumption of dairy products. For many years milk has been used chiefly with coffee, but gradually the parents are rea - lizing that they should supply their offspring with more of the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION duct of the dairy cow. There is one strictly sanitary dairy in the capital,' San Jose, but for the most part milk is delivered in cans from door to door, the milk peddler being seated midway between four cans on his horse. A bell brings the housewife out to the milk peddler with a dish and she receives her milk just about as nature produced it. It brings a high price, 20 cents a quart being the common quo - tation. The men. who own the good herds of cattle, however, have no trouble in disposing of their milk at a premium when produced clean and properly bottled. Several of the breeders also produce cheese and butter on their farms which I was told was greatly sought by the better families, especially In the cities. I will say, however, that in general I found milk quite hard to obtain as a beverage. The Dairy farms The dairy farms are located for the most part on very good land at the foot of the mountains, several of them being located beneath the volcano near Cartago. Most of the equipment is home made but very substantial and I found the barns and dairy buildings immac - ulately clean. I visited one splendid Holstein farm owned by Mr. Rafael Vargas. There were about 50 head of milking cows on his farm and there was not a poor one on the whole farm. The type ran better than we would see In the average farm herd of the United States. About 20 of them were purebreds and the balance high grades. Streams of water flowed continuously through the gutters and the milk was cooled in the spring water from the mountains, thus elim - inating the necessity for Ice machines. This progressive farmer had erected a silo and had grown the right kinds of feed. He is known in Costa Rica as a very wealthy man, yet I was told that he once peddled milk on horseback through the streets of San Jose. A few of the farmers were young men who had attended colleges of agriculture in the United States and had hot only taken back our Ideas about dairying but also some of the good blood of several of our dairy herds. Precautions in Shipping to Latin American Countries I found that the Texas fever or cattle tick Is prevalent all over the Latin American countries. And since it is there it must be con - tended with for the present at least. Tflerefore, only young animals should be shipped to these countries, usually under one year of age and about eight months of age if possible. I was told that they seldom lost a young animal shipped from the United States, while about '75 per cent of the older animals fail' to survive. These young </seg>

As Costa Rica has a temperature very similar to our climate of May and June, there is no appreciable falling oft in milk flow of imported animals. This is not entirely true In some other countries. For example, in the United States Government herd near Cristobal, which Is typical of the Panama country, I was told by the men in charge of the herd that the production showed a decided decrease. They have found, therefore, that the purebred- bulls when mated with the native stock, produce offspring which are fair producers in the first generation and very good producers in the second and third generations. Our Government maintains a herd of about 400 head of Jerseys and Holsteins near Cristobal, the American city of the Panama Canal. I saw quite a number of cattle in this herd from the United States and they apparently wefe doing very well with the exception that they were not producing as high as they would b« expected to do at home. The grades which are the result of our purebred bulls, were very good specimens and probably offer the best solution to the improvement of dairy cattle in most of Central America. All of these people are very friendly to the United States' livestock interests and it behooves us to send them animals which will be a credit to both their industry and to ours. By selecting good animals, crating them properly for shipment and promptly furnishing the regis - tration papers, we will do a great deal to further our Interests in those countries. I was told that tuberculosis is not a great problem in Central America and that while there has been some abortion, it apparently is not as widespread as In many of our states. Dairying in Cuba I left San Jose on the morning of April 4th, arriving In Havana, Cuba, on the 9th. Inasmuch as it was necessary to wait two days for a boat to the United States, I visited several herds around Havana where I found cattle of the Holstein, Guernsey and Jersey breeds, all tracing to the blood of our American herds. The owners of these cattle were exceptionally courteous in showing me their herds and their general equipment and seem most anxious for all of the help and advice we can give them In breeding and feeding, especially the latter. They have not been successful in the vicinity of Havana in growing clovers and alfalfa but are experimenting with other legumes and believe they will solve the problem of roughage. Good milk retails for from 20 to 30 cents a quart in Havana and is being pro - duced under very clean conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION I greatly enjoyed my two days in Havana with Col. Euu».uu Puyol, retired General of the Cuban armies. Since the retirement ot Colonel Puyol, he has devoted his time to his farm and is developing two good herds — one of Jersays and one of Holsteins. There is con - siderable Interest in dairying in Cuba and they anticipate that they will soon be needing more cattle. The shipping problems are much simpler for Cuba as cattle can be loaded in the car and shipped right through to Havana, being transported from Key West to Havana in the freight car steamer. I called upon the Secretary of Agriculture of Cuba and other officials and found them very much interested in hearing about dairying in America. Conclusion Three days after the close of the Exposition in 'Cartago, Costa .Rica, the medals and diplomas were awarded before a large gathering in a Cartago theater. All dairy cattle breeders who had taken part in the Exposition were on hand to receive their awards. At this time the people of Costa Rica through thetr breeders and through the Government showed their appreciation of the help which we had given them by awarding me a very beautiful gold medal. I was asked to carry their best wishes to the United States as well as the gratitude of the dairymen for the assistance we had given them at the first National Exposition. I can only say that It was a real privilege and a great pleasure to work for a week with such a progressive, courteous and sincere people and I hope that my trip will prove of lasting and mutual ad - vantage to the dairymen of both Costa Rica and the United States. MR. LAWRITSON: I am sure we all enjoyed Mr. Cooper's very interesting address and we certainly appreciate your coming, Mr. Cooper, and giving us this valuable information. I just imagine from your description that It must be a very Interesting country to live in. I believe Dr. S. W. Alford has an announcement to make before we continue our program. Dr. Alford. DR. ALFORD: Mr. President, and friends: I just wanted to mention the matter of tickets for. the Fun Feed. Those who haven't received tickets and who wish to attend the Fun Feed stand a chance of getting one at the door at 5:00 this evening where we are estab - lishing an exchange office. The man in the ticket booth will refund money for any tickets that are not going to be used so that you might be able to purchase one of these tickets that are brought back. The entertainment after the banquet Is. free to all those who care to attend. The balcony will be open at 7:00 for those who wish to enjoy the entertainment. Thank y.ou. </seg>
            <seg id="p264">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. LAWRITSON: While we are on the subject of tickets, 1 want to remind you of the Dairymen's Association banquet at 6:15 Thursday evening at the Lincoln Hotel. We have sold a great many tickets and they are going pretty fast. Please try to get your tickets as soon as possible. The committee has promised us a better program than we had last year, and that assures us of a splendid time. I would like to pause a moment to honor one of the real pioneers In the dairy Industry. I notice that we have in the audience today Professor T. L. Haecker, a real pioneer who has contributed a great deal to the advancement of the dairy industry. He is the father of our own A. L. Haecker. I hope, Mr. Haecker, that you will be able to attend a great many more of these meetings. The next part of our program has to do with Dairy Herd Im - provement Association work. Mr. M. L. Flack has the supervision of this work in the state and I am going to ask him to take charge of this part of the program and introduce the men who are going to speak. . Mr. Flack. MR. FLACK: Folks: I think the President today has a good way of getting out of things. He always has a way of getting some - one else to work, and getting other people to work. But, I guess those are the qualifications for a good president. Without any further comment we will proceed with the rest o" this part of the program. We thought it would be nice to have several of the men who are members of the D. H. I. A. and have been for several years, to say a few words to you. We need encouragement to keep 'people in the association. We should make it a five year program rather than one year. We are only going to have time for three or four talks. These . men have been in the working field and are going to be able to point out the practical side of D. H. I. A. work. We have picked men from four different sections of the state. We have a man from up in the northeast section of the state, one from way put in the west, another from the southwest, and a man from this community. These men have been in the association for quite a while. I do not doubt that there are a great many more in the audience who have been in the association just as long, but we have picked these men at random and I am sure that most of you will be willing to let them give the talks. Mr. Ed Renard has been a member of the Washington County association since 1924. Mr. Renard has been secretary of the associa - tion and one of its best workers. He has always believed in the work and has shown great improvement in his own herd. He has a small herd of Holsteln cattle which he started and in 1926 he had 326 pounds of butter fat and he finished 1930 with 400 pounds. This shows that somebody has done some work to improve the herd this much. I am going to ask Mr. Renard to talk to you a- few minutes. Mr. Renard. </seg>
            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION MR. RENARD: Mr. President, and friends: I do not doubt mai there are testers who could duplicate the work I am doing at present. I have not done much of this kind of work, but I have tested cows quite a while. I started out with very moderate means. I didn't have a very good herd. I had always fed cattle but we saw that a little more money could be made by selling milk in Omaha, but as I did not know the value of cows at that time I am afraid I did not get the best of cows. .However, I did know the value of good herd sires. I was looking for production for I found that that was what I was getting my money from. I did not make rapid gains, but I saw a consistent gain every year on the herd averages. In culling, which is merely gambling, we took .a chance on what was right and what was wrong. Sometimes we were wrong. I "nave had four purebred sires. If a man starts with a good foundation it might not take him long to get into something really good. If he knows a good animal when he sees one he has a great opportunity through testing to find out whether his judgment was correct. We have our breed problems, our problems of market, and location, to compete with. In this par - ticular Instance as shown, herd Improvement can be done with mod - erate means. I have no fancy barns as I am on a tenant farm. I have gotten along as well as I could and tried to do as the Extension Service told me. I can tell a few little circumstances that might be all right here. At a sale in Omaha that I attended there were several cows that were termed "best cows". These naturally sold for more money. I bought two cows that moderate means could afford that were not included among these. I started feeding straight grain, then I found out that ground grain was better, so I bought a grinder and ground my feed. I balanced my rations as best I could. After test - ing, I found that these cows proved to be the best that I had in my herd, while these other "best cows" proved to be less valuable. How - ever, I did not get any heifer calves. Out of three only one proved to be a producer. I have a good demand for my stock. The fact is that I could sell more than I have to sell. I don't know that this is as interesting as it might be. I do not like to take any more time at this than I. have to after hearing the splendid speaker that has just given the address. The main benefit that I have derived from testing is the herd that I have built up. I am proud of my herd, and I am not ready to go out of the game, and we have as low prices in Omaha as you have here. I guess we will all stay in the business for a while before we can work out of this depression. I wouTd like to leave this time for some of the other men. I thank you. MR. FLACK: . Often when I get down to Filmore County I stay with Mr. Sumner Barnell. He always gets out at about 4:00 in the morning and makes me get up to eat flap jacks with him, and I can </seg>
            <seg id="p266">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE testily that they are really delicious. He started testing with a good herd with an average of 285 pounds of butterfat and now he has an average of 345 pounds. He has always had a good herd but has had a hard time getting pasture. Mr. Barnell. MR. BARNELL: They have called on me to give a little dis - cussion of what I have observed in testing work. I have fed what I have on the farm. Three years ago 1 was told that cows were milked through their necks. This sounded Queer to me but he said that you had to put it in through the neck before you could get it out through the udder. I have been in the association for five years; first in Clay- Adams, then the Filmore, and Blue Valley. I have had real good luck, but I have had to do some culling, and some difficult problems have come up. One cow that I had made 335 pounds of fat in her first year. Then I had a cow that couldn't furnish enough milk for her calf. Later she came up and on her two year old record she proved to fill out and made 317 pounds of butterfat and on her three year old record she averaged in ten months close to forty pounds a month. From this I have decided that the best thing we could do is not to accept the facts that we receive from our first year testing work but stay in the association long enough to find out exactly what the cows are going to do and what they are worth. I thank you. MR. FLACK: Mr. Barnell always says a few words and goes straight to the point. Some time ago Mr. Barnell was trying to get a pedigree from me. I happened along one day just In time to hear him calling down the silo to his son, and he said, "I wish that long - geared Flack would get me that pedigree." When he saw me he said he'd have said the same thing if he had known I was there. The next speaker is a man that I know a lot of you know. He is one of the best breeders of dairy cattle. This man has been in testing work since 1925, increasing his herd average from 285 pounds of butterfat to 345 pounds and he has a large herd at the present time, pretty close to fifty head. Mr. Fred Egger. MR. EGGER: I don't know as I am going to tell you a great deal that Is new to you but I will try to tell you how we developed our herd. We started with 25 cows with an average of 285 pounds per cow and we had them tested one year but in 1926 we dropped out. From then on the herd increased in production to 345 pounds of butterfat. We then doubled the number of cows, making 50. The - lirst Increase in the first two years was brought about mostly by the feeding of corn. We then found out that we couldn't distinguish our heifers from each other, so we put a tattoo mark on all our new heifers so they could be recognized. We have had a very good sire. It is the good sire that Increases the production of a herd. We used this sire for about five years and have 16 daughters sired by him in the herd. The 16 dams of these daughters had averaged 320 pounds </seg>
            <seg id="p267">.NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION of butterfat per cow, while the 16 daughters averaged 490 puuuua, an increase of about fifty per cent. This bull is still in use. It can readily be seen how much benefit we derived from testing. MR. FLACK: It takes a good bull to increase the production of the daughters over dams by 50 per cent. Now we have a man from Dawson County, whom I have heard before and can recommend. He is interested in testing and has a very good herd with an increase of 367 pounds to 396 pounds of butterfat. Mr. Terry Bell. MR. BELL: It is a pleasure to be presented on. this program. You are all probably saying that the pleasure is all mine. I find that cows respond to having the chill taken off the drinking water during the real cold weather. You will derive a benefit if you have the dams tested if you want to sell young stock. People now are looking for the records of the cows they buy.. Cream separators often prove a source of loss to the tester. 1 found that I was losing butterfat through a poor separator. After changing I found that I was losing .16 per cent of h,utterfat which amounted to $63.50 in a year's milk at that time. I have used just two purebred sires during my three years in the testing work. The first sire wasn't as good as he might have been because his daughters fell down quite a bit. He was a very typy animal, but I was very pleased when the state came along and took him because of tuber - culosis. My next sire had production back of him. The average pro - duction of his dam was 945 pounds. We have to remember reasons why an animal is good and we get something to remember from some testing records. The bull pen is another Important matter to consider. One does not realize until it is too late that this is a matter to tend to promptly. One morning my herd bull got me down and bruised me quite a bit. It didn't take me long to get a pen fixed up for him. Cow testing in dairying should be put on a business basis. The banker can't do business without keeping books. You can't get the most benefits from testing in one year. It is known that you can't develop type in hogs in one year. The same holds true with poultry, any kind of live stock, or corn. The value of our product is being recognized by people over the country and the more It is recognized, the more the demand for it is going to be. We learn in the association work also that a dairy cow is the most efficient producer of human food. The cow that only produces 8,000 pounds of milk in a year will produce more fat than the carcass of the 1,200 pound steer. The higher the production of the cow the more butterfat proportionately she produces. I found that balanced rations increased the butterfat production 30 per cent. I also found that most people think that all you have to do is to feed regularly. High producing cows need a grain ration when on </seg>
            <seg id="p268">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF. AGRICULTURE pasture, as well as in the winter time. A cow must be in good flesh at the time she freshens if she is to reach her maximum production. I notice that the milking machines interest a great number, of people and it pays to use one if it is used right. The main benefit of testing is in our ability through the records to build a high producing herd. Most of you are familiar with the figures put out on the production of cows; that is, the cow producing .100 pounds of butterfat makes $ 14.00 above cost of feed; the 200 pound butterfat cow makes a profit of $56.00 a year, the 300 pound cow J96.00 and the 400 pound cow $138.00. We can milk one 300 pound cow and receive the same as from seven 100 pound cows. In closing I just wanted to tell the little story of the rooster that wakened one morning bright and early and seeing a hole in the fence started out to explore. He wandered around the yard and finally came to the ostrich pen. He saw several walking about, but over in the corner he saw something else. Hurriedly he went back to the pen and called all the hens around him and told them to follow him. He took them over through tlie hole and through the yard to the ostrich pen and to the object that he had seen in the corner, which happened to be an ostrich egg. He said:. "I just wanted you to see what other people were doing." I thank you. MR. LAWRITSON: We all enjoyed these talks and I think that these men gave us some pretty good evidence that the D. H. I. A. has been beneficial. At this time I would just like to announce the annual meeting of the Dairy Development Society tomorrow morning at 10:00. You want to be here to hear Mr. Carl R. Gray, President of the Union Pacific railroad and also President of the Nebraska Dairy Development Society, Mr. George E, Farrell who is in charge of Extension work, Washington, D. C, Mr. W. H. Brdkaw, Director of our own Extension work in Nebraska, and the Honorable Duncan Marshall, former Minister of Agriculture in Canada. I know that it will be an interesting program and will be worth your while to attend this meeting. The next speaker on the program hardly needs an in - troduction. He is one of the outstanding men in the dairy Industry today and I don't know that the committee could have selected a man more interesting and better qualified to address us on "What's Around the Corner for the Dairyman". Mr. A. J. Glover, Editor of Hoard's Dairyman. MR. GLOVER: At the beginning of a new year, it does not seem out of place to give some consideration to the past and to anti - cipate the future. For several years earnest men, interested in the welfare of agriculture, have been devoting themselves to determining ways and means to extend this industry greater opportunity for de - velopment. </seg>
            <seg id="p269">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION We have all seen the necessity of increasing the opportunities ior securing a larger remuneration for those who live on the land. We recognize that the farmer has certain disadvantages, and to overcome them attempts have been made to secure legislation that, in the minds of some, would cure the ills of agriculture. Fora number of years there were strong advocates of the McNary- Haugen bill, which was introduced in Congress. This bill proposed to export surplus and levy a certain fee -upon the product to sustain the loss on the product exported. This bill failed to become a law. We still have those who believe in the debenture plan of im - proving the prices for agricultural products. This plan would pay a portion of the tariff on a product on all that was exported. Congress enacted in 1929, a law known as the Federal Marketing Act, which is now in operation under a Federal Farm Board. We have those who believe that the Federal Reserve Board can create higher price levels and that through other forms of legislation, agriculture and unemploy - ment can be helped. Every thinking person desires to create a better income for agri - culture and to do away With unemployment. It is safe to say there is practically unanimous agreement to accomplish this. To me, any attempt made to regulate, artificially, the price of any commodity is fraught with danger, and this is especially true if production cannot be controlled. It is only necessary to relate a few instances where attempt has been made to regulate prices by law through the force of government in order to show the disastrous results. Japan attempted to hold the price of raw silk at a definite level. The price of silk went to ?16 a pound in 1920 and it is $2 a pound in 1930. England, through the Stevenson Act, attempted to peg the price of rubber at a profitable level. When the Stevenson plan went into effect, rubber was selling at 22 and 23 cents a pound and when it was discontinued, on November 1, 1928, it was selling at 19 cents a pound, and now rubber can be purchased at 8 and 9 cents a pound. All the Stevenson Act did was to raise the price of rubber temporarily which stimulated the planting of rubber trees, the making larger use of old rubber and going further into the forest for new rubber. Brazil has, over a long period of years, attempted to stabilize the price of coffee only to meet defeat in 1930 and now coffee can be bought for 8 cents a pound. Without doubt, coffee is one of the chief factors that caused the recent revolution in Brazil. If we turn to sugar, we find Cuba selling raw sugar in 1920 for 20 cents a pound and in 1930 for one cent a pound. As has been stated, this is equivalent to a drop in wheat prices from $1.00 a bushel to 5 cents a bushel. Cuba tried to limit the amount of sugar produced. This raised the price and stimulated the production in many other countries. The result — overproduction and a ridiculously low price. </seg>
            <seg id="p270">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Before we shall get very excited over controlling production by law, or prices by law, we would like to note at least some degree of success by some other nation. The many failures which have followed in the wake of attempting to control prices by law leads me to- be very skeptical of arbitrary regulations to solve our agricultural prob - lems. Whether there is any plan in the scheme of things that will permit any such thing to be done to the advantage of an industry is still to be found. So far, artificial regulation has ended by inflict - ing heavy penalties upon the producer. If we cannot bring about prosperity in industry by law, many people feel that it is hopeless. I do not take this view of it at all. It occurs to us that there are many things that can be done to help our great industry. In the first place, we must recognize that every worth while in - dustry has its problems. Industry's problems began when the steam engine was invented. The farmer's problem began when the plow was brought into use. Since the advent of labor saving machinery, both in industry and agriculture, constant change has been brought about in both fields of endeavor. The invention of machinery has thrown people out of work; changes have had to be made to find jobs for them. The advent, however, of labor saving machinery has brought to us the luxuries and a standard of living that are not enjoyed by any other country In the world. The laboring man of today really has more opportunity for enjoyment, larger contact with the world, more satisfaction in living, than the kings of a quarter of a century ago. Some will say, however, "Do away, with labor saving machinery. Go back to the sickle or the cradle, and we will not be confronted with these many complex problems". There is no use thinking about this. The farmer who has his self-binder will not go back to the cradle; the horse and buggy will not take the place of the automobile: the poor road will not replace the concrete; the candle will not dis - place the electric light, or the jews'-harp the radio. It is human nature to go forward. It is human nature to take the easiest course and whenever a machine is invented to take drudgery out of work and to increase our efficiency, that machine Is here to stay. We might as well start with the premise that we are going forward with the Inven - tion of labor saving machinery that we may do the work with less labor and that power In the form of gas and electricity will become larger factors in- the operation of our farms and industries. One of the difllculties we have In solving our problems is to determine when an industry is fairly well off. Take, for example, the dairy Industry in the years 1926, 1927, 1928 and 1929, which brought the best returns to the dairy farmer of any time since dairying became an industry. Still we heard much complaint about the bad conditions of the dairy farmer. We received letters asking what could be done </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION to make this industry more remunerative. Now that fat is selling lor around 30 cents a pound, the industry is facing the problem of adjusting itself so that some profit can still be. made. We realize certain injustices are Inflicted upon the farmer. We have an antiquated system of taxation. The farmer's share of taxes is all out of proportion to his income. The taxes on land will be from 25 to 50 per cent of its rental value. It is unnecessary to say more to show that agriculture is paying too big a share of taxes. To revise our system of taxation is not an easy matter but it must be done and by men who will do the job fearlessly and unselfishly. Proper utilization of our land has never been made a close study and we have really no national plan. It seems to me one of the mpst important functions of the Farm Board would be to direct itself to this problem. We have land under . cultivation that should be in forests or utilized for grazing purposes. We see no opportunity to reduce the acreage of cultivated land except to let the marginal lands pass out of use. If a farmer pays his tax on land, he is not going to let a portion of his farm lie idle, even though It might be the wise thing to do if all would do it. Opportunity is offered to market our products more advantag - eously. It has been recognized for years that it is costing too much to get the products from the farm into thT? hands of the consumer. There is probably no definite solution of this question, but by directing ourselves to the study and application oT better methods of distribution we can narrow the spread between the price the producer gets and what the consumer pays. Power is one of the factors that must be utilized more advan - tageously on the farm. The advent of the gas engine and electricity has changed materially the operation of farming. The farmer who is attempting to handle his industry as was the common practice twenty - five years ■ago, can scarcely hope to make any money. In fact, unless hia farm is paid for, it is doubtful whether there is any possible way for him to earn and pay for a farm under the system of agriculture in vogue a quarter of a century ago. The proper use of power must be solved; it must be utilized economically and advantageously. Elec - tricity, to us, is the greatest servant that has come to the farmer in all time. Machinery has taken the drudgery out of farm work and to get the largest profit from it requires planning and a change in practices on the farm. No one has the vision to see just how these things will be ultimately applied. We must first comprehend these new forces that have come to agriculture and then try to. adjust them that they will serve us efficiently and well. If we would devote ourselves to the things that are within our own control, that we may use them better, we will accomplish more than by constantly harping' upon what the government should do to </seg>
            <seg id="p272">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE save uur Industry; what the Federal Reserve Board might do to Inflate prices; what nations might do by getting together and outlining a plan that would improve both industrial and agricultural conditions. We should never lose sight of the necessity of having laws that will give every industry an equal opportunity, but it seems to us a waste of time to attempt to secure laws to raise the prices of products when we have had so many failures by the nations that have attempted to . peg prices. It is better for us to be . devoted to better utilization of power and machinery and new inventions, to the fertilization of our fields that our crops will be greater per acre, to better feeding and handling of our cows, than to be so "much concerned with things over which we have little or no control. It Is desirable to try to stabilize business but business of the nation depends largely on how the millions of people handle their own personal affairs. If each farmer will determine a plan that is best for him to follow and direct himself to carrying it into effect, more will be accomplished for agri - culture than In any other way. Further, local communities should develop a program best fitted to their advancement. This requires organization. If we study the history of agriculture It will be found that the farmer is the biggest factor in its success and the next more important factor to its proper development is organization. When Wisconsin found that she had to reorganize her agriculture, the leaders came together and formed the Wisconsin Dairymen's Asso - ciation. This was done to coordinate the dairy forces of Wisconsin and because there was needed a united force to guide the development of the dairy industry of that state. It is not for me. to relate in detail what this organization has done; but its outstanding accomplishments, may be tabulated as follows: - 1872— Organized by W. D. Hoard and six others. Secured a reduction of 60 per cent on freight rates on cheese. 1873 — Secured use of refrigerator cars that opened the world's market to Wisconsin cheese. Started cheese boards to aid marketing. 1875 — First dairy fair in the United States held at Milwaukee under auspices of Wisconsin Dairymen's Association. 1876 — Exhibited butter and cheese at Centennial Exposition, se - curing favorable trade outlets. 1878 — Promoted exhibits New York International Dairy Fair. • 1879 — Started agitation against oleomargarine. . 1880 — Silo propaganda started with address by L.

In this review of the forces which have developed and directed the dairy industry of Wisconsin and placed the agriculture of this state upon a better basis, it Is clearly evident that capable leadership was required. It is also clear that planning and work improved farm prac - tices and that no governmental assistance was sought in this period of development. It reveals, it Beems to me, that it was through the peo - ple of the industry, supported by proper legislation to give full oppor - tunity for development, that an industry was developed upon the right basis. We are now confronted not only with dealing with the factors which have built our Industry, but new ones have entered. New con - ditions must be met. Before we can deal with them intelligently, we must understand them and get a vision of what must be done to use the new agencies in the proper way. It is perhaps well if I relate a new system of farming and milking developed by one of my friends, Mr. H. W. Jeffers, President of the Walker-Gordon Laboratories Company, a division of Borden Company. At its farm at Plainsboro, New Jersey, this company keeps 1,600 cows and produces certified milk. Mr. Jeffers has developed what he calls centralized leadership and decentralized operation of his farms and cows. At one time his company operated several thousand acres ot land, but it has been divided into small farms ranging in size from 12U to 160 acres. These farms are rented to farmers who operate them as their own and the crops raised are purchased by the men who feed and take care of the 1,600 cows. The cows are still owned by the company, but rented to those who feed and care for them. The milk Is sold in the udder to the Walker-Gordon Laboratories Company and they milk the cows. </seg>
            <seg id="p275"/>
            <seg id="p276">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION That milking may be economically done and under the bein. hu - tary conditions, a new method of milking was developed by Mr. JeSers. It is a revolving platform, a Roto-Lactor, holding 50 cows, and makes a complete revolution in 12% minutes. On this revolving platform the cows are milked. Each cow is provided with a milking machine and above her is an inverted glass jar for holding her milk. The cow enters the platform while moving and when in place a stanchion automatically closes about her neck. One of the attendants washes her flanks and udder with water; another dries her. with hot air gen - erated below the Roto-Lactor. The next attendant puts on a sterilized milking . machine. When the cow has had her ride on the merry-go - round, the job of milking is completed, the stanchion opens and she walks off the platform back to her barn. I might add that the humid - ity and temperature of the air in the room in which the revolving table Is built are artificially controlled. This method of milking and the conditions surrounding the cow, as Mr. H. W. Jeffers puts it, is the answer to a cow's prayer. Immediately there comes to your mind, is this practical? Will it become in general use on the farms of this country? These ques - tions I shall not attempt to answer. This Roto-Lactor is the only one of its kind in the world and maybe another one will never be built, but still it may have the influence of revolutionizing dairy prac - tices. On the farm on which this Roto-Lactor operates, there are 1600 cows that are milked three times a day. Two men are required to handle the milking machines and they work eight hours a day, but the milking operation is continuous. It requires three shifts of men to take care of the 4800 milk ings a day. This new way of milk - ing releases 75 men and the owner estimates it will save him $100,000 a year in labor expense. That is something to think about. We can speculate still further. In this farm there are several thousand acres of land. It was operated as one farm. This was cor - poration farming under a large scale. The cost of producing the feed | for the cows under this system became excessive. This caused Mr. Jeffers, the manager, to change his system of operating the land and to rent tracts ranging from 120 to 160 acres to each person to operate. Since these men became their own bosses, they are pro - ducing twice as much feed as when they were working for wages. This shows the difference between working for wages and working for self. The principal crops grown on these farms are corn and alfalfa. The corn is ensiled and the alfalfa is artificially dried. These methods of preserving the feed produces the highest quality product. The silo is a well known and established institution. The artificial hay drier is still new and in the experimental stage, but it has been in operation long enough to reveal that it produces the finest quality of feed for dairy cows. The question to be answered is, will it be practical on the </seg>

            <seg id="p278">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE oruinary farm? Will the Inventors so perfect It that one hay drier can be owned by a few farmers? It Is a great advantage to take the green feed as it is cut and haul it -directly to a hay drier. It saves labor, storage space, and provides the best quality of feed. The ques - tion to be answered is, can its operation be made practical for groups of farmers? These new inventions, improved machinery, and electric power challenge every thinking person and cause him to wonder what will be the farm practice of the future. Some think that the family size farm must give way to corporation farming. There are those who advocate chain farming, which I interpret as the federation of several family size farms under one leadership. We have some successful corporation farms but I do not believe that this style of farming will make rapid progress, notwithstanding under certain conditions for the raising of certain crops It has proven successful. To me, the family size farm will predominate, for men have a natural inheritance for owning land and are willing to operate it at a lower return for their labor than to engage in some other occupation. The family size farm is too important to our civilization to think of its being superseded by Industrialized farming. To maintain the family size farm means that its owner or operator must be interested In adopting new methods of farming, and when they are applied- intelligently, I see little oppor - tunity of corporation farming superseding the family size farm. It is evident we are confronted with a farm problem and we must ever be alert to Improve farm practices In order to keep abreast with the times. No matter what our agricultural practices of the future will be, certain things will always be fundamental to successful farm - ing. The land that is occupied and used for agricultural purposes must be productive. The fertilization ot our fields to make our acres produce more is sound. If we are to decrease production by operating fewer acres, the logical way to do this is to let our marginal farms lie Idle or devote them to growing timber. When a farmer bears the overhead expense of his farm, paying taxes and the upkeep of the buildings, operating costs, and the like, it Is not sound to request him to let some of his acres He idle or to urge him to permit his acres to decrease In fertility that they yield but small crops. The farms that are operated should be worked to full capacity for I see no other way of the farmer making a return on his investment. We must ever keep in mind the necessity of efficient cows. Our national herd numbers around 22,000,000 averaging 4600 pounds milk containing 180 pounds of fat. We can scarcely hope for the prices of dairy products to be sufficiently high to make any profit on cow's" of this capacity. Through hard work, close living, the farmer may make ends meet but there will be no profit at the end of the year with cows of this capacity. Unfortunately, many people Interpret efficient </seg>
            <seg id="p279">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION production as leading to overproduction. In reality the low prouu^ius cow is the surplus producer, the one that never pays a profit regard - less of what the prices of dairy products may be. If every dairy herd in this country would get rid of the cow that is paying no profit, there would be an actual shortage of dairy products. To locate these non-profitable cows, there is no better system than the herd improvement association. Too much emphasis cannot be put upon these organizations. They not only locate the poor cows but they reflect how well the farm is managed. Herd improvement associa - tions are just as much a measure of the man as they are of the herd. When rightly Interpreted, they lead to better farm management, and this is what we need more than anything else to solve our problems. We need, too, more proven dairy sires. One of the great drags of all breeds is .the poor blood they carry along. Many a registered bull is worse than worthless, for he not only holds out false hopes but may actually reduce the production of the herd. Science has shown the way for breeders of purebred cattle to develop a class of bulls which can be depended upon to produce progeny of high production and good type. The breeder's problem is to create that Kind of animal. There is no better or more sure way for the breeder to eliminate this low producing blood than to place every one of his cows under test. The herd improvement association offers him this opportunity and at low cpst. "But," say some, "The records obtained in this way are not ac - curate enough, and, lacking close supervision, there is chance for fraud to be practiced." Those who take this position have a wrong conception of herd Improvement association work. They are looking for high records when In reality the breeder should look for low producing cows and eliminate this blood from his herd. Even though the records were ten per cent inaccurate, which they are not, the herd improvement association would still be the most effective agent for securing proven sires, bulls that would be capable of transmitting high production and good type. It wouldn't be possible to eliminate the low producers over a period of say twenty or more years without ultimately establishing breeds of dairy cattle that would far excel those that we have today. Let me emphasize that herd improvement asso - ciations are to locate low producers' that they may be eliminated from the herd and not primarily to find the largest producers. The dairy farmer must ever be alert and produce a quality pro - duct. We have made great progress in the increased consumption of milk and its products, but still greater, progress can be made if we can place upon the market the kind of product that appeals to the palate of all people. One of the best ways to depress the prices of dairy products Is to put upon the market poor quality dairy products. The successful dairy farmer ever keeps in mind the growing of crops </seg>
            <seg id="p280">RErORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE noi milted for making a ration for his cows, taking into consideration the adaptation of his land for the growing of his crops. Alfalfa ami corn are two crops that will produce more per acre than any crops that have yet been discovered, and they supplement each other admir - ably. These crops may be determined as the foundation of good feeding and when the farmer raises them in adequate quantities, he has little difficulty in making a ration that is suitable for high pro - duction. To obtain the best results will require some ground feed, for there is no economy in under feeding a good dairy cow. It is her function to take the feeds of the farm and manufacture them into milk, and to run her at one-half or two-thirds her capacity, is like running a factory with half the number of men that could be em - ployed advantageously. Our task then is very similar to what it was when agricultufe became an industry; that is, more efficient production which means to the dairy farmer better cows and larger returns from his acres, the growing of suitable crops for the making of good rations for his live stock. Science has added to our' problems in that It has brought increased power to the farm which we must learn to utilize efficiently. Improved transportation and machinery demand different practices on the farm, different methods of manufacturing our dairy products, and improved methods of distribution. MR.

We are having trouble at county fairs, state fairs, and other gatherings with vendors who are selling "frozen custard" as ice cream. The state officials have tested this substitute and find that it contains 1% to 2% per cent butterfat, while the ice cream standard is 14 per cent. This is in - creasing and we are going to face the same problem that the butter people are facing at the present time. I don't believe a motion is necessary if the committee will adopt this amendment. MR. LAWRITSON: Does the committee wish to adopt this amend - ment? MR. OLMSTED: We do. MR.

LOOKING FORWARD Address Given at Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Banquet Thursday Evening, January 8, 19ol By HAROLD HEDGES Assistant Professor of Rural Economics University of Nebraska Those in charge of the program of the Dairymen's Association are evidently quite concerned about the future. If you have looked over the program you have probably noticed two topics which suggest rather similar discussions: one is "Around the Corner", presented by Mr Glover; the second "Looking Forward", which I am assigned to dis - cuss tonight. So far as the subjects may indicate I believe I have the easier assignment. Not being cross-eyed or otherwise endowed with unusual eyesight, I am of the opinion that it is less difficult to look forward than around the corner. I have one serious handicap, how - ever, Mr. Glover was first on the program and he is here presiding tonight to see that I stay away from his subject. Perhaps, though, I can add a thought or two to what he has said, or, if I do repeat, I may be able to express myself differently so you . will not be able to . recognize that it is repetition. There are two sets of problems- the dairyman must face if he is to make the most from his enterprise. Most of your program this week has been given over to discussion of breeding, feeding, testing, disease control and other phases of herd management. There we have one set of problems, which are essentially problems of more efficient production. They are the problems you are meeting every day right on your own farm. Greater efficiency brings lower costs, and lower costs contribute to increased returns. The added returns thus obtained by reducing production costs are mainly the result of individual effort. Improvement in returns is always a stimulus to Increased production, but this means if improve- </seg>
            <seg id="p284">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ment by Individual effort stimulates the market supply only gradually. Thus the possibility of depressed prices from a sudden excess of pro - duction is avoided. This gives added emphasis to the statement that a cent saved in cost is worth more than a cent added to selling price. The second set of problems the dairyman must meet are largely beyond his control as an individual producer and yet he cannot dis - regard them. He must look beyond his own barnyard if he is to make the most of his opportunities. Dairy production on other farms, in other communities, in other counties, in other states and even In other countries influences his returns. More than that, the desire and ability of people to buy dairy products affects his business. It is some of the aspects of supply and demand — the price problems — which affect your dairy income that I am going to discuss tonight. Did you ever stop to think that farm production is carried on ahead of demand? In other words, when the- farmer plants his crop he anticipates that somebody will buy the product when it is ready for market at some future time. When you start raising heifer calves, you figure that there will be somebody who will want the product from them when they are producing milk. The question is this: Do you take it for granted you will have a market or do you" try to make a reasonable estimate of what that market will be? Do you let past or current prices influence you in your plans for the future or do you give some consideration to what prospective prices may be? In farm production some estimate is made of the future. We can't get away from forecasting. If we guess, we stand a 50-50 chance of being right. If we let present profits or losses determine our plans for the future, we are likely to increase our chances of being wrong. If we try to give careful consideration to supply and demand factors and thus give weight to prospective prices, we can increase our chances of being right. One hundred per cent accuracy is far too much to expect because there are too many uncertainties in farm production. Weather hazards, disease, insect pests can alter the best of plans. Even so, there are enough known, factors to be considered that it is a paying proposition to be forward-minded. What are some of these factors of supply and demand that need be considered in making dairy plans for the coming year or five years or decade? It is well to keep in mind that plans for produc - tion of livestock or livestock products must usually be on a long time basis. In the case of cattle it takes more than a year or two to expand numbers very much. Then too, the capital investment is relatively high, making it costly to get in and out of the business. Therefore, the "in-and-outer" in the cattle production business — either dairy or beef — is more likely to be a high cost producer than in most other lines of agriculture. This serves to emphasize the need to look be - yond next week or next month in making. plans, lij the dairy, business. </seg>
            <seg id="p285"/>
            <seg id="p286">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Now what about the present and the prospective status »i me dairy business? Thinking in terms o£ the decline in butter prices since the fall of 1929, the present status is not so good. Considering it in relation to other farm products, dairying does not look so bad. Compare prices of dairy products and other farm products in Novem - ber; 1930, with what they were in November, 1929, in terms of index numbers. All farm prices dropped thirty-three points or about a fourth; grain prices dropped thirty-eight points or nearly a third; meat animal prices dropped twenty-six points or between a fifth and a sixth; poultry product prices fell off fifty-four points or more than a fourth; and dairy product prices declined eighteen points or about one-eighth. Prices for butterfat, which is the main concern in Nebraska, declined more than other dairy products, being about a fifth lower. Then also, butterfat prices have declined very materially since November when the calculations I just gave were made. Considering all dairy pro - ducts, however, the industry is in relatively better shape than most of the other lines of agricultural production. That is pretty hard for a dairyman to believer The price declines of the past fifteen months have made us realize that there is a demand side of the market that requires consideration. When business is going along smoothly we are inclined to take demand for granted and think of price more in terms of supply. Those who have done that have had a rude awakening in the past year. Here is something to think about. Right now or in the months ahead we may have to forget about 1927 or 1928 prices, just as in 1921 and 1922 we had to forget war-time prices. A period of declining price levels for nearly all commodities has prevailed since 1920. Oh yes, we have had short periods of recovery but throughout the period the trend has been generally downward. Neither is the present long time down trend of prices an unusual thing. Looking back into price history a hundred odd years we find that prices went through a similar down turn, at first rapid and then leveling out, beginning at the close of the Napoleonic wars about 1815 and continuing. approximately thirty years. Then the trend reversed and price levels reached another peak at the close of the Civil war. Again they turned downward, at first rapidly then more slowly, until a trough was made in the "nineties". Then followed the long climb up - wards, culminating in the peak in 1920. The rest is recent history. Along the long swings up and down we have the short-time per - iods of active and slack business. Since 1920, we have gone through four slack periods including the present one: the one in 1921 which hit agriculture so hard; the second, a minor one in 1924; a third In 1927; and now the fourth which began in the last half of 1929 and which finds nearly the whole world affected. Unless some unfore - seen catastrophe occurs there is good reason to believe that recovery </seg>

            <seg id="p288">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ..i uuoiness will be in evidence before IS 31 is far advanced, but it may be irregular and slow. Such a recovery should bring some price recovery but probably falling short of 1928 and early 1929 levels. Now to get back to that long-time trend of prices downward and its consequences. They are probably fully as significant as those of the depression. Much of the borrowing ok farm production must be on a long-term basis. When the long-tide trend of prices is down - ward, borrowing classes are affected adversely. It means that they must pay their indebtedness with more expensive dollars than those they borrowed. Expressed in another way 1 , it takes more bushels of wheat or pounds of butterfat to pay the loan at the due date than at the time the loan was secured. Let us get back and consider more' specifically the dairy situation. On the whole, the United States is on a domestic basis in production of dairy products. That is, we neither import or export any great volume of dairy products. Thus, we can think of demand largely in terms of United States population, though not overlooking the world aspects. The population of the United States is increasing at the rate of about and one one-half million a year or between one and one and one-half per cent. With per capita consumption unchanged, that would call for an increase in production of dairy products of about one or one and one-half per cent. The fact of the matter is the long-time tendency is toward an increase in per capita consumption although that tendency is probably temporarily obscured by the depression. On the present basis of production, the United States is so close to an export basis that it would requi.-e bul! little increase to lose the tariff protection enjoyed by American producers. With the margin given by tariff protection, prices can be lowered so that consumption can be encouraged and some adjustment, made before an import basis is reached. Now let us look at the situation from the standpoint of supply The number of milk cows in the United States showed little change from 1926 to 1929, but during 1929 increased close to three per cent. What has happened in 1930 is still unknown. The depression and drouth have obscured the situation. However, knowing that there has been a very evident tendency to hold back more than the usual number of heifer calves in recent years, and that stockyards receipts during 1930 do not indicate that more than the usual number of aged cows have been moved from farms, it seems there is still the tendency to expand dairying. Back in 1924-25, we were in a period quite similar to the present one. The number of cows had been Increased and production expanded until prices were on an unsatisfactory basis. | The adjustments at that time came rather quickly. Feed costs were relatively high, so less ■ I " ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p289">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Intensive feeding was practiced. There was a decided let-up in da..,,*"&amp; in the Cornbelt. Herds were culled closer than usual and poor pro - ducing cows sent to market. In the present situation there Is little evidence that similar adjust - ments are being made. During the summer and early fall, the drouth and high feed costs slowed up production but feed costs at present are relatively lower than prices of dairy products. There is very little to indicate that there is any material let-up in dairying in the Corn - belt or that herds are being culled more closely than usual. This is probably because farmers can find no enterprise that offers much more than dairying in the way of returns. - ■ Two Important things to consider from a long-time viewpoint is the volume of basis stock — in other words, cow numbers — and the trend in production per cow. Improvements in breeding, feeding prac - tices and the like have been increasing the production per cow and that may be expected to continue. Changes in cow numbers usually are made slowly. With no other important lines of farm business offering much more than dairying, much adjustment through shifts from the dairy business to some other line is improbable. The fact that changes In cow numbers are made slowly does not mean that quick changes cannot be made in dairy output, as by less intensive feeding, but such changes are limited. The depression coming when it did in 1929 and 1930 probably revealed the underlying tendency toward overproduction more quickly than it might otherwise have been in evidence. When the depression is past, recovery in demand will probably occur. It seems almost too much to expect that business revival will entirely correct the situation. In fact, the industry is likely to still find Itself over-expanded. Con - sidered from the standpoint of basis stock, there was a very close balance between output and domestic requirements in 1927' and 1928. With more cows now than then, the effect of foreign dairy products is a threat which needs consideration. In the past two years this has been particularly noticeable at the season when southern hemisphere butter supplies moved in largest volume. In both years, a weak market has developed in the late fall. To avoid imports, domestic price levels had to be held down. I have already mentioned the matter of alternative enterprises. The Cornbelt states, of which Nebraska is one, is sort of a balance wheel In- production of poultry and dairy products, because there is more choice of enterprises in this area than in such a dairy area as Wisconsin. The most important alternative enterprise to dairying in this area is beef production. When butterfat is relatively higher than . beef, more of the beef or dual purpose cows are milked. When butter Is relatively low, the calves are left to milk the cows. Over the next </seg>
            <seg id="p290">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ikw .yearn there is good reason to expect further increases in beef cattle numbers and In time, lower beef prices. Such a development would Increase the tendency to shift to dairying. I realize I have presented a rather hazy picture of that to which 1 consldeiTwe may look forward. I trust you will recognize that we are dealing with probabilities and conditions that are constantly in a state of change. There is one more thought I want to add. What may be best for the dairy industry to do may not be best for the In - dividual dairymen. I don't know the margin between your costs and selling prices on dairying or in alternative enterprises. In the final reckoning that must determine whether you increase or decrease your dairy business or shift to some other line. One thing is always safe — economy in production. The other thing to observe is caution regard - ing the future, whether it involves an Increase, a decrease, or a shift in enterprise. Consider the known facts; consider what has happened under similar conditions in the past. It will not insure a correct esti - mate of the future, but will reduce chances for error. i EXHIBITS By C. W. NIBLER, Assistant Secretary Through exhibit material prepared for county fairs and other agricultural meetings, the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association has endeavored to create more interest towards dairying throughout the state. This year there were prepared eight sets of exhibits which were sent to county fairs or other similar agricultural meetings. That the displaying of these exhibits at county fairs is worth while is plainly seen when. the development of this project is noticed. A few years ago only a limited number of exhibits were sent out, while in 1929 the number of county fairs at which this exhibit material was displayed was twenty-four. This year twenty-nine county fairs were reached, showing an increase of five county fairs over the previous year. The exhibits were first sent out in August and were used until the latter part of October. The distribution of these exhibits was state wide. They were sent as far west as Dawes County, as far south as Hitchcock, Thayer, and Jefferson Counties and as far north as Antelope County. i By means of these exhibits an endeavor has been made to illus - trate every phase of the dairy industry that should be of interest to the people. Some phases covered by these panels were marketing, feed - ing, care of the calf, care of the herd sire] housing plans, production of clean milk and cream and food value of dairy products. </seg>

            <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION NEBRASKA DAIRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY ANNUAL REPORT 1080 During 1930, the society continued its general dairy development program, emphasizing dairy calf club work, the use of more purebred sires, testing of cows for production, and the eradication and control of contagious abortion. During 1930, Manager O. H. Liebers and Assistant Manager M. N. Lawritson were called upon to address 317 meetings; 224 were de - voted to calf club work and 93 to the greater use of purebred sires and the encouragement of herd Improvement associations. There were 12,110 people in attendance at these meetings. Nine hundred eighty-flve farm visits were made. Four hundred flfty-two of these were for the instruction and demonstrations to dairy calf club members. Two hundred of them were in connection with purebred sires, 222 were general dairy problems, and 111 were in connection with cattle purchases. The society received 3,405 requests for service through the office. 1,429 of these were taken care of by correspondence, 998 by telephone, and 978 by personal conference. The society assisted 159 Nebraska breeders and calf club mem - bers in purchasing 246 foundation animals. Eighty-eight of these animals were purchased from 48 Nebraska breeders. The cattle pur - chased included 91 calf club calves, 50 purebred sires, and 105 cows and heifers. In addition to these direct purchases the society assisted a great many Nebraska breeders in selecting several hundred addi - tional animals; also was of indirect assistance in disposing of surplus. The society has during the past few years persistently encouraged farmers and breeders of dairy cattle to control the spread of con - tagious abortion. This disease is a menace to the dairy industry and results annually in a large loss to our dairymen, not only from the loss In production of milk and butterfat, but also in the value of the calves lost and the breeding troubles resulting. During the past several years, the society has confined its cattle purchases to calves and open heifers under breeding age, as they are rarely affected with contagious abortion, and all animals of susceptible </seg>

In addition to this we have given out the best information available, prepared . by Dr. Van Ea, of our Animal Pathology Department, and encouraged farm - ers at meetings and individually to take active steps in the control and eradication of this disease. SIRE PURCHASES I During 1930, the society rendered assistance in the selection and purchasing of 50 purebred sires for Nebraska breeders. In each case the utmost care was taken in securing bulls of good type, breeding and production records back of them. The standard of production requirement is 500 pounds of butter fat on a mature basis. The bulls purchased include 22 Holstein, 20 Guernsey, 4 Jersey, and 4 Brown Swiss. The dams of 40 of these bulls have already com - pleted a year's production record ranging from 451 pounds as a heifer to 1,069 pounds of fat, with an average of 655.3 pounds. Of the dams of the remaining 10, one has a very substantial seven-day record, and the other 9 are on official test, and making records as two and three year old heifers. The average cost of these 50 bulls is $255 per head, the price ranging from $100 to $800. All of the 22 Holstein bulls were purchased from Nebraska breed - ers; 10 of the 20 Guernsey bulls were purchased from Nebraska breed - ers, the other 10 coming from Wisconsin and New York state. One of the Brown Swiss bulls was purchased in Nebraska, while the other three came from Illinois and Ohio. Two of the Jersey bulls were pur - chased from Nebraska breeders and the other two came from Min - nesota and Tennessee. The society rendered effective assistance in the first annual Pure Bred Dairy Association sale conducted by the Guernsey Breeders' Association in connection with their annual picnic held last June at Fred Egger's farm, near Sprague, Nebraska . Seven splendid bulls, whose dams had produced 400 pounds of butterfat, or more, were quickly purchased at an average price of $140. The ages of these bulls ranged from five months to eleven months. The Guernsey Breed - ers' Association considered this sale a success, and is planning on making it an annual event. BOYS AND GIRLS DAIRY CALF CLUBS During 1930, 897 boys and girls were enrolled in 98 dairy calf clubs In Nebraska. This is a slight increase from the 1929 enroll - ment of 877. The society purchased 91 calves for club work. Fourteen of these calves were purchased from Nebraska breeders. In selecting club calves we require that they have good individuality, out of sires </seg>

Very few of the calves were out of dams with less than 350 pounds of butterfat. Most of them were from dams of between 400 and 500. pounds. Fifty-nine of these calves were purebred and 32 were grades. Qrowth of Dairy Calf Club Work in Nebraska NUMBER OP MEMBERS 1923 II^OHB 1928 I2ZBII HHH 1929 1930 U^2j| STATE FAIR EXHIBIT There were 188 calves exhibited at the last State Fair, 4 less than in 1929, but the general condition of the calves, training, and the showmanship of the owners were far superior to any previous year. The three' highest winners in each group of the purebred calves were permitted to show in the open state classification the following day. Twenty-four of these first, second, and third prize winners in the various groups entered the open competition against the best breeders in the state and professional show herds from other states that were here. All but three of these club salves placed in the money. Two of them won first, and- there were quite a few second, third and fourth places claimed by them. NEBRASKA AT THE NATIONAL DAIRY SHOW Through the splendid cooperation of representatives of the five dairy breeds and many others interested in Nebraska's dairy develop - ment work, Nebraska again was represented at the National Dairy Show at St. Louis, October 9th to 16th, with six Brown Swiss calves, six Ayrsblres, ten Guernseys, and six Holstelns — a total of 28 head. Nebraska again won ribbons in every class entered, with a total cash premium of $565.00. There was only one other state that exceeded Nebraska's winnings, and it was represented by the five breeds against our four. In the Brown Swiss breed the boys from Dodge County placed first with their state group. Allen Muliken was second and Richard Johnson third with their calves in under a year class; Earl Johnson fourth and Pete Ibson fifth with their yearlings. </seg>
            <seg id="p336">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ni the Ayrshire breed Beatrice Youngers of Cass County was fourth and Keith Besack of the same county was sixth with their heifers under a year. David Youngers was flfth and Dale Higgens of Gage County was sixth in the yearling class. The Ayrshire group placed third. The Guernsey groups won fourth and seventh. Esther Schoen - leber won seventh with her heifer under a year. Harold Luikart won first and reserve champion on his cow; Lawrence Liebers fifth on his cow and Harry Liebers fifth on his yearling. All these Guernsey winners were from Lancaster County. The Nebraska Holstein group won seventh, and Harold Turner of Webster County won fourth on his heifer under a year, and Ray Hoy, of Lancaster County, won eighth on his yearling. In the showman's contest Harry Liebers won second and Roy Hoy ninth with 288 entered. The dairy cattle judging team from Webster County placed fourth as a team; was first in judging Jefseys, sixth on Ayrshires, ninth on Guernseys, and tenth on Holsteins, with 25 teams competing. Edward Pavelka was the second high Individual judge in the contest, with 75 competing. He placed first in judging Jerseys and eighth in judging Holsteins. Orvllle Turner was fifth in judging Jerseys. In the dairy demonstration contest Nebraska was represented by Glen Henager and Warren Fager of Cass County. These boys placed fourth with 44 teams competing. The expenses of transportation and travel of the club members to the National Dairy Show at St. Louis were met by the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce and a group of Omaha and Lincoln business men, supplemented by the prize money awards won by the boys. DAIRY CATTLE EXHIBIT AT THE STATE PAIR The society has been active in encouraging a large and creditable dairy cattle exhibit at the Nebraska State Fair. It was very gratifying to see a total of 50 breeders exhibiting 323 cattle at the last State Fair. Forty-one were Nebraska breeders exhibiting 187 head; nine were out of the state herds' exhibiting 136 cattle. Not only did Ne - braska supply the largest number for the show, but they were also successful in winning. Harold Hoy, a Lancaster County club boy, won first place In the open show with his yearling Holstein club calf. Ronald Clark, of Lewlston, won first on his four year old Guernsey hull. Donald Egger, of Sprague, a club boy, won second with his three year old bull. Elmer Young and Lawrence Liebers, both club boys, won first, senior, and grand champion on their bull. </seg>

DAIRY HERD IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS During 1930, the society, in' cooperation with the Extension De - partment of the College of Agriculture increased the number of herd improvement associations to 31. There were 703 members testing 10,322 cows in the 31 associations. Of the 10,322 cows tested 1,036 were culled out .as unprofitable. The average production of all cows reported In dairy herd im - provement associations in Nebraska during the past year was 8,014 pounds of milk, and 307.7 pounds of butterfat. This is 74 per cent more than the average Nebraska cow produces. The benefit derived by farmers In Nebraska from dairy herd im - provement work Is obvious. It not only enables them to Intelligently cull their herds, and thereby lowering the cost of production, but it also increases the value of the cattle and their offspring remaining in the herd.

            <seg id="p339">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION "PROMOTION AND IMPROVEMENT IN DAIRY PRODUCTION" Address by HONORABLE DUNCAN MARSHALL, Former Minister of Agriculture, Toronto, Canada. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I was to have been here a little while ago, but I was at another meeting and we got to dis - cussing one or two problems and I am a trille late, so you may escape part of -what I might have said. I am sorry that I was not able to be In the meeting, and catch more or less the general drift of the discussion, but I judge from one or two things I heard after I came in that it has as its object the promotion of dairying and improvement of conditions on the farm. No doubt someone has been talking about getting high production from cows, proper feeding, and the value of weighing milk. 1 was on a farm in Alberta where the man came from Ireland and settled some 25 years ago, with no knowledge of farming what - ever. He had been in the civil service and occupied a position. He was restless because he couldn't be living on a piece of land. For the last ten years he showed me his returns. He kept an excellent set of books. He was a man of some training, fond of figuring anyhow. His average receipts showed he had made on the cows milked $4,533.00 for a period covering the last six years. He- had not added them up farther back. He was milking these cows with his own help, had used a milking machine nine years, only missed four milklngs with it. lie showed me his herd of cows. He aimed to milk about 40 'cows, so kept 45 or 4 7. He pointed with pride to the fact that there was only one cow not born on his own farm, and bred by himself. He never kept a heifer not out of a high producing dam. He weighed the milk, keeping track of the cows for a long period of time to show which gave the richest milk. In this way he could build up the herd. He owned 960 acres of land, a small motor car in the garage for his own use and he said, "I'll show you the car I bought for the boys." He showed me a Packard, paid $3,700 for it. "All they wanted was a good car," he said, "and I made up my mind I would buy them one. The day I bought it I paid cash for it, and no one can come and take it away. For the 23 years after I had proved up my home - stead I never owed anybody anything, always kept enough seed grain over, so if I was hailed out I wouldn't have to buy my seed grain." That is the best kind of way to get the best thing out of life. He took pleasure in buying the motor car for the boys, and pleasure out of the cows. </seg>
            <seg id="p340">REPORT' OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE *he greatest thing dairying does for agriculture is that it teaches boys and girls to like good cows, to learn what good cows are. and to admire them and to more or less make companions of them so to speak, and to take pride in what they may fio for them. They do not need to be purebred. More than one-third of this man's cows were just graded up cows; they were excellent individuals, and some were purebreds. I frequently run across men who are farming, taking dairy farm - ing seriously, grade cows up to the standard 01 purebred. I remem - ber in 1912, I went to Ontario with the view of buying a trainload of cows. I went to the Minister o.f that Province. I noticed that one of the best things one could do was to milk cows, have a steady income the year round, and it provides them Trith steady employment. But if he has some compensation from that employment he need not worry so much about it. We were buying cows from $60 to $75 apiece. I went to a farm, picking a good bunch of cows. There were 20 milking on pasture in June. Nothing but grass. The owner showed a statement from the cheese factory, saying he was shipping just a little over a thousand pounds of milk a day; that is, a little over 50 pounds a day these cows were averaging. I ask him if he would sell any. He didn't want to sell any. I asked him if he would take $75 apiece, which was a very good price. He asked me if I thought he was crazy. I did some fast arithmetic. I said, "I will not offer you $75. Let me pick the five top cows." There was not much dif - ference. "I will not give you $75, but $150 apiece." Nobody had been offered $150 for a cow up to that time. He didn't know what to do. He went in and asked the boss — went in and saw his wife. He came out and said, "You get the cows. If I don't sell them, some of them will die next week!" I gave him a check for $750. He kept the check for two years at very great risk to himself In order to show it to some of the neighbors to prove he had received this amount for his cows. I saw him some three or four years after. He told me that the sale of the five cows determined his boys to be dairy farmers — decided that today there was some recompense for the man who did the job well. He said that one purchase meant that his two boys were going to farm and establish themselves in the neighborhood as dairy farmers, and breed up good cows. What did the cows do for me? I took them home and took pretty good care of them — freshened in the spring — carefully weighed them. They were fed well, gave an average of a little over 14,350 pounds each. Sold the milk that year from these five cows for $1,750.- Had three good heifer calves out of the five cows. Figure paying $750 for the cows, with feed, all of which we raised on the farm, $1,750 worth of milk the first 15 months. We had them two or three years. We got three of the best heifer calves on our farm to add to the herd. So it was profitable to the buyer as well as the seller. </seg>

            <seg id="p342">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION It is things "like that that make farming worth while. Every effort this organization makes to raise the standard of dairy cows in Nebraska will not only improve dairying, but will improve agriculture in general. It will have an appeal to the intelligence of the boys and girls growing up on the farm. It will have the effect of retaining on the farms those who might otherwise be lost to it. Everything that stimulates any particular line of agriculture in that way can not help but be of very great value to the agriculture of the state. I offer congratulations to the association. All these movements are good things — the boys and girls clubs, and I heard a word about bringing the old man into it, but when the calf is sold don't let him get the money. But all of these movements that encourage boys and girls to know and understand the beauty and attractiveness and the profitableness of good livestock, and especially of dairying is at the foundation of American agriculture, can but be of great value to the state. </seg>

            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION HOME ECONOMICS SECTION OF ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE On Tuesday, January 6, the twenty-sixth annual meeting of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture was opened. The first meeting began at 9:30 with Dr. Rebekah Gibbons presiding. Mrs. N. W. Gaines led in community singing with Mrs. J. L. Thomas at the piano. The songs, "America." "There is no place like Nebraska," "Work for the night is coming" and "Carry me Back to Old Virginia" were sung heartily by an unusually large audience. Rev. W. B. Bancroft of Temple Baptist Church pronounced the invocation. The President's Greetings Mrs. E. P. Noyes, president of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture, said: "We have gathered here for the 26th annual meeting of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture. It gives me great pleasure to extend greetings to so large a number this morning. Surely it shows interest and appreciation of our programs when so many are present for the opening session. Perhaps some may be here for the first time and to those we want to give a hearty welcome. We feel certain that you will find this program not only interesting and enter - taining but instructional and inspirational as well. Just why are we here? What is the urge that brings us to these meetings year after year? Sometimes the weather is bitterly cold and when it is., it always makes It more difficult for us to leave home and also takes more courage to get ready to come to these meetings. Some of us have a long way to come but still we come. Perhaps one reason why we come may be for a little vacation from the routine of home work. Now there is nothing wrong for a woman to want such a vacation. The rest and the change is good for her and refreshes her. Making new friends cheers her besides the helpful hints and inspiration which she receives for her job of home making. We know these home - makers have an interest in their homes for just as soon as this program is over all of these farm homemakers are hurrying home. "Another reason why we come may be the opportunity it gives us to visit with friends. If a daughter is attending the University It also gives mother a chance to see a little of the school where they are sending their boy or girl. Another attraction may be the Fun Peed, another is the Master Farm Homemaker recognition which no doubt some have come especially to see and hear. Then we like to renew acquaintances we have made In previous years and form new friendships with people from different parts of our state and also with visitors from other states, some of whom come to bring us helpful </seg>
            <seg id="p352">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Information. But I like to feel that the real urge that brings you to these meetings year after year Is the practical work and inspir - ational value of our programs. The instructional work will not only rest and interest us while we are here but we can take it back to our homes and the inspiration and valuable information will help us with our problems. A poet long ago made this rule, 'Hear a little music, read a little poetry, view a fine picture every day that worry and care may not obliterate the sense of beauty that God. his given us.' That music may be the song or whistle of your boy or you may secure it by turning the dial of your radio. The poetry may be a bit of verse or a magnificent chapter from a book. The picture may be a pretty view from your kitchen window, a lovely sketch' or a favorite picture hanging on the walls of yo\ir home. We have left our worry and cares behind and have come to refresh ourselves with the good things of this program. Music' and poetry have been pro - vided and some pictures have been arranged on this platform for inspiration and also on our program we have one period for pictures, and even as we walk about this campus we may see, if we will, beauty in the trees and shrubs even though now they are shorn of their summer garb. I want to bring to you a new year's thought. This new year's thought was written by a Nebraska homemaker. She is the mother of a little boy. All of her poetry is about little simple things and when I asked her the privilege of reading her message, she very graciously assented. NEW YEAR'S THOUGHT The Second Mile Each life is full ot dull routine, We call it the first long mile. But the second mile that we choose to go Will make each life worth while. It's the little mound of whipping cream You pile on a plain dessert; It's the finely 'broidered monogram You add to your husband's shirt; It's the- ruffle on a house dress . That glveB it a perky air; It's the brilliant cover of cheery chintz You add to a shabby chair; It's the scarred old kitchen table Made brave with a coat of paint; It's the patience you bear with small mishaps When you utter no bitter complaint; It's the hour after the work is done That you spend with a little boy </seg>

NEW COTTONS FOB DRESSING UP THE HOME AND FAMIL* Miss Catherine Cleveland of the Cotton Textile Institute, New York City, had an Interesting display of new cottons for home decora - tion and for members of the family for various occasions. These she showed and explained the new features. She said, "People have for - gotten cottons but here are usable suggestions for each room of the house." She showed cotton lace curtains good for high rooms, his - torical print, "the founding of Amsterdam," dotted swiss, voile, mar - quisette with plain broadcloth as drapes for girls room and bed - spreads which had the effect of net over color but were simple, prac - tical and fast in color. : She showed children's clothes in calico of monotone prints trimmed in trimstltch; a school dress of cotton covert with plaid gingham blouse; Sunday dresses of dark blue cotton broadcloth with button trim. She said, "Buttons are used on everything." For spring a cotton tweed jumper dress with plaid blouse, a brown velveteen jacket and a cotton suede cloth beret. She showed dresses of oxford cloth and striped madras for spectator sport, a cotton mesh with a downy texture of Angora cotton. For lounging pajamas, cotton tweed in plaid, with a narrow wale velveteen pique jacket; for daytime wear cotton tweed with plain broadcloth; for beach pajamas gay prints and montone prints in vari - ous colors. She said, "Dresses simply rely for charm on Interesting line and detail. Designers have given us variety from which to choose," and illustrated these points in sport, afternoon and street and formal dresses. Several college girls also appeared in dresses from the different groups. She closed by saying, "Cottons come in such a variety." _ ; Bound Tables At 10:45 the group divided into smaller sections for the six round tables which- were held in various rooms of the home economics building. Subjects lor the round table were: 1. Building the Young Child's Personality — Dr. Ruth Staples. 2. Making the Most of Your Looks — -Miss Grace Morton. 3. Art in the Home — Miss Bess Steele. </seg>

The Outlook in Extension — Miss Mary-Ellen Brown. A brief report of each of the round table discussions follows: "BUILDING THE YOUNG CHILD'S PERSONALITY" "There are a great many people in the world and all entirely different. One person goes around with a chip on his shoulder, an - other loses his temper easily, another given to exaggeration and an - other interested only in self. Then we have 'people who are interested in others and people with great self-control. "Just recently people have begun to learn that the reason grown people are what they are is because they have formed habits when children that make them what they are today. Those who as adults lose their self control easily are the ones who got what they wanted when they were young. Personality traits are habits of thinking that we have acquired throughout our lives. Habits are not just brushing the teeth and drinking milk but include all kinds of behavior whether good or bad. Personality traits are a whole bunch of habits. "All children like to have attention. One little girl is always charming when taken into admiring circles of friends. She has ac - quired a way of just smiling and beaming to get attention when she wants It. Another child who likes attention has a different set or habits which he uses to get that attention. He is a naughty boy. He will knock away another child, or pull another child's hair just to get attention, even though that attention may be a rebuke when he gets it. He will push back a chair noisily, stamp on the floor just to get someone to look at him. "A lot of fundamental sets of habits are needed to make the needed social adjustment in life later on. There are three habits which seem to cause more trouble than any others. First is the habit of obedience toward authority. When we think of a well disciplined child, we know that that person will become a well disciplined adult — a person who has self control, high principles and standards and exer - cises them. This sort of person puts himself in the background. We should work with the child in keeping always ih mind the well disci - plined adult of the future, thus giving the child a good start. A tiny child does not know what is good for him. He has to do what his parents want him to do. He obeys only when told, but cannot be expected to know what to do when the one who guides him is absent. He soon learns not to touch the article that is denied him, just be - cause he is told not to, then when he is older he learns to obey. Finally the child will take over the responsibility of good behavior for himself, not because the parents want him to, but because he </seg>
            <seg id="p355">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION thinks it is the right thing to do. Certain things nursery scnooi children learn are customary and by the time the child is in high school he can conduct himself. Parents lose sight of the fact that they must build up good judgment in the child rather than make him mind. "There is such a thing as over-discipline. Parents cannot expect instant obedience under every circumstance. Oftentimes there is need for the parent to give a reason for the request which he makes of the child. If a parent Is overly strict, the child becomes rebellious and naughty. In other cases the over-disciplined child loses all his own initiative and has no self confidence in his own ability. "Another mistake people often make is in telling a child to do a thing, then forgetting all about it and not seeing that it is done. The child knows the mother will not make him do it, therefore, he grows up to have no respect for her authority. The mother should be perfectly firm and see that the thing is carried, to completion after she has asked the child to do it. Never give an order that you do not expect to have carried out. But be reasonable in giving orders and do not ask the child to do anything which he is unable to do. Oftentimes it is necessary to warn a child a few minutes before hand that it is bedtime and that he must begin to put away what he is doing. This prevents the child from feeling rebellious at being told to go to bed immediately. "In one home where there was a caller the mother gave the child scores of orders during the half hour the caller was there. The child knew he could. not do all of them so did not attempt to do any - thing. Use few important orders and concentrate on -them. "Be consistent in having the child do the same duties every day. Do not require him to put his toys away one day and not the next. Where there is more than one person who has the disciplining of the child, all should- agree on some fundamental rules for governing the child. Otherwise the child will soon learn that each one has a dif - ferent standard by which he is governed and will try to work one by asking the same request that he asked o£ the first person who refused it. Every year the child should be allowed to develop more of his own behavior standards. If you reason a thing through with a child he will not argue. "At one time a mother needed to make a trip to New York City and take her four children with her. Before going she explained to the children that it was a very large city to which they were going and that she would be very busy and asked them not to ask questions when she told them what to do, but do what she requested. She got the results she wished from the children simply because she had always asked the children to do only things tTlat. were reasonable and within their power of doing. </seg>
            <seg id="p356">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Honesty is a trait which must be developed in the child it we expect the adult to be a law abiding citizen: A child needs to under - stand that other people have rights and that he must not bother certain things which belong to other people. He has to learn to share his time and his toys with other children and grown people. Otherwise, he will snatch and grab things from others. In this way he might develop habits of stealing. A child in the nursery school had never played with others so had everything for his own. At first he took everything from others in the nursery school. When the other chil - dren saw him coming they would throw things away rather than let him have them to play with. Little by little this child found out it was more fun to share things with others and have friends than to be shunned by all the children, but it was a hard lesson that should have been learned at home. "Another little girl snatched toys from everyone, especially if no grown person was watching, but when someone was watching she was very obedient. She is gradually learning that if. she is disagree - able, folks will leave her alone. If a child can. share his own things with others and have children to play with, it is much better than any adult lecturing. "Truthfulness is largely a matter of imitation. Children pick it up from other members of the family. If a mother tells a child that she will not have a little boy around at all if he does not do thus and so, that child soon learns that she does not mean Just what she says and the threat soon has no effect on him. A parent should not make promises to a child that she knows can never be carried out, such as promising a piece of candy as a reward and not giving it when she knew at the time there was noj candy In the house to give. A child soon loses confidence in such promises and he will learn to be deceitful with others the same as his mother is with him. A lying child is the outcome of it. "Whea the child is very young he has a keen imagination which develops rapidly. He will tell wild tales and Imagine all Borts of things. This is not to be worried about, but must be guided very carefully by the parent in an effort to get tne child to see the differ - ence between imagination and real happenings." Mention to him that what he has told is just a story and not a real happening: Do not stimulate the child to say things that are not true to avoid a spanking. "Oftentimes when a child is overpraised because he is very bright it will result in him cheating in school in order to get a grade rather than failing. He simply cannot bear failure because he has always been put on a pedestal by the parent when speaking of him to friends. It is very important that a child not be put in a grade tliat is too difficult for him. If he constantly falls, he will develop a feeling of inferiority. On the other hand, the child needs some experience with failure that he may have a sympathy for others. </seg>

            <seg id="p358">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "All children need love and affection from their parents, but some get an overdose. Children in orphanages do not get along well be - cause no one Is really interested In them. Children brought up mainly by servants have this same difficulty. People should not be foolish about the way their affection is expressed. It causes a child to become extremely dependable and loving means much to him. He is not in - terested in good wholesome play with other children and he becomes very self centered. One example was a little girl who was brought to the nursery school by her mother. Everything possible was done to get the child gradually weaned from her mother and willing to stay at the school, but it simply could not be accomplished. The child had never before been away from her mother, she had never slept alone, but always with a grown person because she might get lonely if she awoke and found herself alone. She could not adjust herself to the group of children because she had never associated with children before. Her mother had kept her to herself just for a pet. This is a great injustice to the child. A child may be loved .very dearly and still be allowed independence. "In one home when a guest is present the child must be displayed by being asked to speak pieces, sing or play the piano. In other words, the parent lives the child's life for him rather than let him use his own initiative and do things because he wants to do them and not as they are dictated to him. . "All of those things cannot be accomplished when the child is well grown up, but must be started when the child is very young. The story is told of a negro mammy who was asked to care for a new baby. She inquired as to the age of the baby and when told that it was two days old she refused, saying that a child learns so many bad habits the first two days. Of course, this is extreme, but illus - trates the point very well." "MAKING THE MOST OF YOUB LOOKS" "In the heart of everyone of us is a deep longing for beauty. For most women, making the most of personal appearance and sur - roundings is their chief opportunity for expressing their love of beauty. "The old Puritanical attitude toward so-called worldly things led to suppression of expression of beauty in appearance and environment, but modern psychology recognizes natural human hunger and the importance of their free expression to bring greatest happiness and contentment in living. "The modern conception of beauty is in line with modern art expression. Mere surface prettiness is a shell for real beauty, which is beauty In character. .There is genuine beauty in a square body carried with distinction or a round body framed for motherhood, or a long nose which bespeaks an aristocratic character.

"With such an interpretation of beauty, we can all have a share. Our duty and privilege is to study to make the most of ourselves mentally and physically and find how we may make the most of our best qualities and minimize the weaker ones. "How frequently the mother in the home sacrifices her own per - sonal needs for her family — how frequently she appears to lose in - terest in making herself attractive. Has she ever thought what wonders it might work with her family to see mother beautiful in face and attractive in apparel? How much she might gain in admiration and respect from her husband and children! Requirements of Attractive Appearance 1. Personal Grooming. What an important part well cared for nails and clean, shiny, well groomed hair have on personal attractiveness. And well cared for skin. It may mean an investment, the advice of a beauty specialist on cold creams and rouge, but it will pay large dividends in satis - faction. 2. Good Posture. Importance of good corsets to hold the large figure in check and to help in good carriage, and well fitting shoes. 3. Costume suited to one's income and one's social demands and to occasion. 4. Good design. 5. Becoming in line and silhouette to the figures. 6. Becoming in color to the complexion and the personality. 7. Suited in material to the figure and the use." The remaining time was devoted to enlarging on the points out - lined, particularly to discussing the problem ot the stout figure. Fab - rics and colors were discussed and certain guiding principles laid down for necklines, collars, sleeves, line movement and textures best suited to them. "ART IN THE HOME" It is possible to bring old, out of date, and "tired" looking home furnishings up to date economically if one uses thought in working out a new decorative scheme, according to [Miss Bess Steele, head of the design division in home economics department, in conducting the round table. "Art in the Home" on the home economics program of Organized Agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p361">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "We should be continually wanting to add to, change and replen - ish our homes," said Miss Steele, She stressed color as an important factor in any scheme of redecoratlon, and said we have been too afraid of colc-r. For the larger areas, or backgrounds, such as the walls and floor coverings, quiet, neutral tones, such as the tans, were recom - mended. "Large areas of color should be similar," is another law to be followed here. Then one can begin to add more interest through using brighter colors and designs in the drapes and smaller accessories such as lamps. These colors should be on backgrounds carrying out the tones of the walls and floor coverings. Every home should have charm and personality. In achieving charm in home furnishings, good taste, care, thoUghtfulness, comfort, radiant cheerfulness, fitness to purpose and friendliness are to be con - sidered. Charm may be found in small homes as well as in pretentious ones, Miss Steele pointed out. To add new life and interest in home furnishings, making a begin - ning is important. After one once has a new rug, table, new curtains, one finds the rest of the room must live up to the good piece of furniture. Perhaps the sofa needs to be recovered, sometimes the room is too crowded and a simpler combination will be found more pleasing, or brighter, gayer colors may be needed. Slip covers on old pieces of furniture often successfully add new life to a room. Friendliness may be added by such pieces as a new lamp, end table or ornaments. Slip covers are quite easily made of inexpensive materials. If the walls of the home are figured the slip covers should be plain, and vice versa. Variety may be obtained through varying plain colors on different pieces of furniture. "Often in redecorating a room it is best to eliminate first, taking out pictures, lamps, and as much furniture as possible." These should be then replaced to make pleasing units, eliminating, redecorating and adding new pieces where needed. Questions Asked at "Art In the Home" Round Table Question 1. "May small boudoir chairs with slip covers be used for living rooms?" Answer. "Such chairs may be used if they fit the scale of the room." Question 2. "Are boudoir pillows all right to be used in bed- ' rooms?" Answer. "Boudoir pillows are useless, yet may be decorative and they are often overdone. Great care must be taken not to use them in the wrong way for decoration. Merchants have popularized them and their recommendations are often misleading. Boudoir pil - lows do not add to the completeness of the practicalness of the room, but If a woman enjoys them she should do the thing that will make her happy. She should constantly study such things so that she may </seg>
            <seg id="p362">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE raise her standards of appreciation. A decorative scheme may be and often is complete without boudoir pillows." Question 3. "What do you think of the use of winter bouquets and artificial flowers?" Answer. "Real flowers are transitory and artificial flowers should be used in the same way. Place them in a room for only a short time for your enjoyment. If they are left too long they become dust catchers. Put them away and take them out occa - sionally for enjoyment." (One woman commented that a few artificial flowers make a very good substitute' for the real thing and that sho preferred dried flowers and berries.) "NEW METHODS OF COOKING IN OLD UTENSILS" "Our aim in vegetable cookery is to conserve as much food value, color and flavor as possible. The conservation of color and flavor are important from the standpoint of appealing to the appetite because we are tempted to eat more of ' a vegetable if it looks attractive and tastes good. We have come to realize the close relationship of these three because we find that a loss of flavor and color is usually accom - panied by a loss of food value. "The three methods used in vegetable cookery are baking, steam - ing and boiling. In baking we have no loss of nutrients except vitamin C which is affected by heat. In steaming we have some loss and in boiling the greatest loss. Not all vegetables are adapted to baking or steaming and since boiling is such a common method of preparing vegetables we need to consider ways of decreasing the loss in boiling. We may boll vegetables in a small amount of water and we may use the water. However, there is danger of scorching if cooked in a small amount of water and it is not always practical to use the water. Vegetable water served with the vegetable is often not eaten but there are various other uses such as in soups, gravies and scalloped dishes. If a vegetable is cooked only until done we lose only a small amount of mineral, while if it is overdone the loss is' greater. Thus to have the minimum amount of loss in the cooking water, cook in the shortest possible time. When it is practical cook in a small amount of water and use the cooking water. "We need to take special care in preparing vegetables for children because if unattractive they will not eat the amount needed for good nutrition. "Vegetables may be divided into four groups according to their color — green, yellow, red, and white. There are a few general rules which we should keep in mind regarding these groups. Green — Long boiling and acids destroy the green color. Alkali, for example baking soda, retains the color. We should be careful to use only a very small amount of soda, about 1/16 tap. soda to 1 quart </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION of water is an average amount. Too much soda will make the vc e &lt;=- tables slimy. Yellow — This color is stable so we need not worry about its loss or destruction. . ■ Red — Alkali destroys the red color and acids retain and restore it. White — Some white vegetables contain a yellow pigment which is brought out in cooking. This is not objectionable. On the other hand a brownish gray color is developed by overcooking. It is the over-cooked cabbage that causes digestive disturbances, which people often blame boiled cabbage for. Onions are an example of a white vegetable which become mild in flavor as they cook but they must not be over-cooked." The cooking of various vegetables are demonstrated to illustrate points in the discussion. Brussel sprouts cooked 10 minutes retained much of the original green color. Those cooked one-half hour were a brownish color with a stronger odor. White cabbage — that cooked 10 minutes remained white; that cooked one hour was brown and had a stronger odor. Red cabbage — was cooked under three conditions: in water with nothing added, in water containing a little soda, and in water con - taining a little vinegar. In a short time both cabbage and cooking water in the first two samples turned blue. The one containing vinegar remained red. When a small amount of vinegar was added to the blue samples, the color changed to red. Spinach — that cooked in boiling. water had a brown green color, while that cooked in boiling water with a little soda added kept its bright green color. Carrots — baked in a casserole retained their color. ■ Utensils were shown and discussed. A Dutch oven can be used as a casserole or a waterless cooker. A pressure cooker can be used for so-called "waterless cooking" by putting the lid on loosely. A casserole in an oven can also be used for so-called "waterless cooking." Questions Asked In the Discussion 1. "Since soda helps retain color why not use it in canning spinach?" "It Is not advisable to use It because one would need to use so much to overcome the acid released by long cooking that it would effect the flavor." 2. "Does soda destroy vitamin C?" "Yes, but we do not depend on cooked vegetables for vitamin C." 3. "Should all vegetables be placed in boiling water?" "Yes, because in this way we lose less of the nutrients." </seg>
            <seg id="p364">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 4. "Should we cook vegetables uncovered?" "Where color Is concerned, they will have a better color If cooked uncovered." 5. "How do you cook cauliflower?" "Drop Into rapidly boiling water and cook until just tender. Do not overcook. 6. "When Is the best time to add salt?" "We will have a better flavor if the salt is added at or near the beginning of the cooking period. " 7. "Does the kind of vessel used effect the color of the vege - table?" "We do not know to what extent the vessel effects the color of vegetables. Both hard and soft water turns alumnium dark. After the finish is worn off of aluminum it turns dark more easily." 8. "Is there any difference in the time of boiling with the use of coal and gas?" "Ten minutes boiling should be the same with either fuel." 9. "Is' cabbage considered a mild vegetable?" "Yes, .when raw and when properly cooked. It becomes strong when it is overcooked." 10. "Is. there any objection to adding a little vinegar when can - ning beets?" "No, it helps to retain the red color. 11. "Should we add soda when cooking dry beans?" "So de - stroys a little vitamin B but most diets contain an abundance of this vitamin so it is not objectionable." 12. "Where can we buy a meat thermometer?" "Prom the Taylor Instrument Co., Rochester, N. Y." "THE OUTLOOK IN EXTENSION" Round Table Discussion lied by Mary-Ellen Brown The first question -discussed was "What Have You Especially En - joyed in Your Project Work the Past Year?" One woman said she had enjoyed getting acquainted with the club members and with mem - bers from other clubs. Another woman said she had enjoyed all of the project work that her club had done and that many evidences of the results from the project study could be found in the community. Among the work which was suggested as being helpful was the home beautiflcation work, the study on winter bouquets, sandwiches, school lunches, accounts for the home, new stitches, new ideas about clothing and the study of the Homemaker Herself. Mrs. Frink of Hastings told that Miss Clark visited a regular meeting of her club and of her interest in the methods used for the project work. Miss Clark is a member of the National Y. W. C. A. whose headquarters are in New York City. After this visit Miss Clark sent a letter to the rural women of England telling them about her visit to. a Nebraska Extension Project Club. </seg>
            <seg id="p365">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Questions were asked in regard to having a "follow-up' on a project the year after it had been studied in a county. The sugges - tion was made that the project leaders would enjoy getting together again after a year's time with the state specialist and the county home extension agent. At such a meeting reports could be given on what had been accomplished during the yast year, beside having a general good time visiting. May was suggested as a good month for such a reunion. The next topic discussed was the growth In the number of project clubs. The following table shows the growth: 1928-1929 556 clubs 8.487 members 1929-1930 674 clubs 10.210 members 1930-1931 790 clubs 12,793 members The above table shows that the growth for the past year was 116 clubs and 2,583 members. This means. that an efficient piece of work is being done, for with only five state specialists the work Is being carried to over 12,000 women a month. The new project, the Homemaker Herself, which was started in September, 1930, was discussed. This project is different from others for there is not so much to see as a result of the lessons, nevertheless It is a .project from which many women will receive lasting benefits. A study of the personality of the homemaker and of her family and community relationships will help women to realize the responsibilities of her Job. Miss Rizpah Douglas talked about plans for her new project which will be Making the Home Attractive, Series II. She asked for suggestions as to what the women would like to have changed or added to her outline. Several additional suggestions were made. Another question asked was whether those present felt it would be better to have the first leaders training meeting for the year begin at 10 o'clock or at 1:30. The opinion seemd to be all in favor of having it begin at 10:00. The Master Farm Homemaker movement is a good one and to have it means as much to Nebraska as possible. Care should be taken that women are nominated and that these are carefully selected. It seems to be easier each year to secure project leaders but still there are clubs which have difficulties. What may be done to improve such conditions? The suggestion was given that in some of the clubs they have one new leader each year, thus there is one old and one new leader serving. There is a need for having the president In har - mony with the project if the club Is to do its best work. The last topic which there was time to discuss was the possibility of some follow-up work on the Child Health Conference held at Wash - ington. Cass county suggested that they were thinking of having an Itinerant worker in nutrition for three months. </seg>
            <seg id="p366">REPORT OF NEBRASItA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE I ., nic topics discussed the second day were similar to those of the first day except there were more questions asked about having a &gt; county home extension agent in the county, as to what it would mean to the county and what it would cost. I "AROUND AND ABOUT THE KITCHEN" - By Miss Mary Mason "With good equipment plus efficient methods the housewife may realize the satisfaction of doing each process well and in the easiest and quickest way possible, thus leaving time for other things. • "The homemaker may find that time set free from housekeeping processes may be advantageously used in assisting in keeping records and in doing bookkeeping for the farm, or she may find that the income . ! j from more time spent in raising poultry or in production of dairy products justifies the purchase of labor saving devices or Installation of modern conveniences. "The housewife should be sure that her labor savers are not labor producers, that they meet the needs of the family, that they will be used enough to make their purchase worthwhile, and that they are constructed so as to be fool proof and so that they will give a reason - able amount of service. She must also consider cost. "Since the market is flooded with highly advertised labor saving devices, the average person must weigh values carefully and purchase essential items first and others as they can be afforded. Every indi - vidual must build up a safe amount of sales resistance. The average home cannot afford to operate an experiment station. "The results of a study by Mrs. Edna Snyder, research assistant In our home economics department, on 'The Selection and Management of Kerosene Cook Stoves' should interest homemakers in this section. The study has been published in Circular 41, College of Agriculture Experiment Station. A washing machine study is now being com - pleted In our research laboratory, the aims of which are to study the cleansing action and rapidity of dirt removal of different types of washing machines, the comparative wear upon fabrics, comparative retention of heat, convenience of operation, and to compare wear upon fabrics by home and commercial laundry methods. This study will be available in circular form within the near future. "The house itself may be a labor saver or a labor producer. Un - necessary traffic and confusion in the kitchen should be avoided. An outstanding situation which should be eliminated is the use of the kitchen sink as a place for the men to wash. A washroom or a wash bench, In case there Is no running water, should be placed in or near the back entrance. Limiting the doors to the kitchen will help to eliminate unnecessary traffic. It should be possible for anyone com- . </seg>
            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ing In from the back of the house to do directly to the dining room without entering the kitchen. "Traffic and confusiorf-may be further eliminated by making It possible to ice the refrigerator or fill the wood box from outside the kitchen. Less tracking across the floor eliminates much extra cleaning. "By minimizing the traffic the kitchen may be made smaller and the housewife will be required to take fewer steps In kitchen pro - cesses. 120 square feet is probably the minimum floor acea for the farm kitchen in which more than one person may have to work at the same time. • "Comfortable positions at work are important for the housewife, for certainly conservation of energy is not an indication of laziness. The kitchen stool, preferable with foot rests and a back rest, will do much in lessening fatigue In a hard day's work. Further, I suggest that the stool have a revolving or swivel seat and that it be mounted on easy rolling casters. "The right working heights are essential for comfortable work. Six or eight inches from the level of the work table to the level of the elbow is right for most people. If the rim of the kitchen sink ■ is on a level with the work table, the floor of the sink is too low for dish washing processes. The dish pan should be raised by a simply constructed rack in the floor of the sink. • "Safety precautions in the home are needed. Last year, according to the Metropolitan Life Insurance company, 24,000 persons lost their lives through accidents occurring in their homes. Falls cause more than a third of these accidents. Among causes of falls are poorly built step ladders, poorly lighted halls or stairways, stairs of steps too steep or stair-carpet insecurely fastened, slippery floors, skidding rugs, and chairs or children's toys obstructing passage ways. Equiping the Kitchen "In equiping the kitchen there must be a just opportionment of the household budget. For $25 a minimum set of kitchen utensils may be purchased for preparing meals for a family of five. For J50 a fairly complete set of utensils; although including nothing electrical and no great variety of pans or bowls, can be obtained. "An overstocked kitchen is a burden, and an understocked kitchen a very definite handicap in kitchen routine. One may be tempted into careless habits of procedure by having too many utensils in use for each individual process. This is one of the dangers of an overstocked kitchen. Besides the extra investment, the overstocked kitchen re - quires a great deal of time to keep in order and there is a waste of energy in moving quantities of equipment in order to find the one thing that is needed. </seg>
            <seg id="p368">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "Time, energy and patience are saved if broken and worn out utensils are discarded as soon as substitutions are made. "Quarreling at your equipment day after day shows poor judg - ment and unsound economy. The coffee pot that topples over every time the lid is open, the pan that will ribt stand up when empty are purchases made in haste without thought of satisfactory use. They should be replaced by carefully chosen equipment. "Forming a plan for household expenditure and apportioning a fixed sum each year for replacement and upkeep of equipment safe - guards against the temptation to buy unessential equipment because you want something new, or it looks interesting, is cheap, and a use might be found for it. Bargain equipment is sometimes expensive. What you get for what you spend is important. "Propaganda or high pressure salesmanship must not influence our purchases. The health of the family is not necessarily endangered if you are using some other pan than a waterless cooker in which to cook your vegetables and meats. The expense involved in purchas - ing a complete set of pans of heavy aluminum ware often lacks jus - tification. We have found that the evaporation, is not greater from the light weight pan than from the heavy weight pan,, providing the lid fits with equal closeness in each case. In choosing pans select those with tight fitted lids, on which the weight of the handle doesn't overbalance the pan when empty. Pans with broad bottoms and straight sides heat their contents more rapidly than those with a small base and flaring sides. Pans with buckled bottoms preventing direct contact with the heating surface are a waste or time and fuel. Three items which might be suggested for the housewife who wishes to build up an efficient set of kitchen equipment are substantial kitchen knives. with a good cutting edge*, stainless steel blade, firmly riveted handle — knives not usually found at the ten cent store; a good can opener; and a convenient Knife sharpener. - A household tool kit may be a very helpful addition to some kitchens. It may be fitted into a drawer or into a shallow cupboard built into the wall or taken from the end of the built-in kitchen cabinet with the door opening back against the wall. This kit might consist of a claw hammer, screw drivers, a small crescent wrench, a monkey wrench, pair of pliers, chisel, tinner's shears, putty knife, oil cans and an assortment of nails', screws, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p369">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION TUESDAY, JANUARY « — AFTERNOON The Tuesday afternoon program was opened with music by a string trio composed of Miss Ethel Owens, violin; Miss Marjorie Baty, cello, and Joe McLees, piano. Mrs. E. P. Noyes, president, presided during the afternoon. Mr. Frlsbie introduced the 4-H Club work. He said that boys and girls were available for 4-H work between the ages of 10 and 21, but that he was sorry that less than one-tenth of the number eligible really belonged. He is proud of the record of this work in the last several years. Of the 150,000 young people eligible 14,805 projects were started and 11,811 final reports completed with stories written, costs totalled and completed. He is proud of the boys and girls. He said that there are five outstanding boys and girls now in Agricultural college who were prominent 4-H club people out in the state before coming here. They are now outstanding in their univer - sity work as they were in their club work. • Charlotte Joyce of Weeping Water, Nebraska, Vas first introduced by Mr. Frisbie. Miss Joyce said: "When 4-H club work is j mentioned my mind immediately turns to my own experiences in the work. The knowledge gained in this project work has been of great value but along with the work comes the contact with other people which I appreciate. 4-H club work helped me to decide the field of work I liked best and it also inspired me to come to college to prepare- myself so I could enter this field. "4-H club folks are outstanding in many fields. Some club folks I have known are now applying what they received from their project work and college. They are: Dorothy Norrls, home agent in Dawson county; Leona Davis, specialist in state office; Marian Williams, state nutrition specialist In Colorado; Grace Henderson, who is getting her Master's degree at the University of Chicago; Robin Spence, county agent in Dakota county; Russel Batie, county agent in Dawes county; Itha Anderson Edson, home agent in Phelps county; Harry Knabe, outstanding farmer; Walter Briggs, Seward; Quinton Enochson, Col - fax; Mary Borreson Nelson, Saunders; Eleanor Borreson, teacher at Wahoo; and. Ruth Davis Hill, Mrs. True Homemaker. i "What others say of 4-H club work: "Mr. Kiem says, 'I think a great deal of it. One of the most valuable things at this time is the work of county agents, Smith Hughes leaders and. 4-H club leaders, and the 4-11 club leaders are the most valuable. 1 This is true because they get right down to the needs of the boys and girls. Of the 104 freshman boys in college this year * 51 are former club members. Every one of these boys said that </seg>
            <seg id="p370">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE -BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ciuu work was instrumental In bringing them to college. Our 4-H boys and girls know a lot about the things they will study and are interested from the very start.' "Miss Fedde says: '4-H club work is of Talue because it develops interest in home problems and a certain amount of efficiency in per - forming home duties. It gives a girl poise, confidence and ability to think while standing before people on her feet.' "Dean Burr — 'Winners in boys and girls club work are generally good students. Their influence is good and wholesome because of their experiences in project work. It is an incentive and gives them an inspiration to do good work. This is a wonderful thing — the fact that it leads them to do good work.' "A mother of a former 4-H club girl says, "My daughter is plan - ning to come to college this year. Do you think she will like it?' My answer Is that there is no doubt but that she will like it and I hope she will not hesitate about coming." Harlan Bollman gave the following report: "Friends of Organized Agriculture: Mr. Frlsbie asked me to briefly tell you about the American Country Life Convention, held at Madison, Wisconsin, last October, and to which I had the honor to attend as a delegate from the University of Nebraska 4-H club. "The American Country Life Association is the outgrowth or a Country Life Commission appointed by President Roosevelt in 1906, to make a study of rural conditions of the United States. This com - mission functioned until 1919 at which time the first National Rural Life Conference was held at Baltimore, Maryland. At this meeting the American Country Life Association was organized. Since that time annual conferences have been held throughout the country. This past October marked the 13th annual gathering of the Association. The theme was Rural Standards of Living and we adopted as our motto 'Live While We Work.' "The main conference was made up of 1,500 delegates from dif - ferent organizations interested in rural activities and colleges through - out the United States and live other countries. The Student Section of the conference, in which I was registered, was made up by 70 students from 17 colleges and universities of the country. Practi - cally all of these students were representatives from University 4-H clubs. "Primarily, this was not a 4-H club conference, but I was intensely interested to see what a great part 4-H club work played in an indirect way at this meeting. We students conducted our own group discus - sions separate from the main conference, under competent leaders. Of course our problems had more to do with farm youth than did the main conference. In the afternoons, however, we were free to </seg>
            <seg id="p371">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION go to the forums held by the adults, and In the evening we were privi - leged to hear prominent speakers at mass meetings. "Time will not permit me to go into detail about the conference. However, it was a great experience for me and I hope I have brought some ultimate 'good back to my club. We have taken steps thus far to become affiliated with the American Country Life Association. I am glad to say that I have been responsible for at least this much. "I would like to say this: You folks who attend Organized Agri - culture know the value of 4-H club work. Go back to your respective communities and keep up with the good work. Last year 800,000 boys and girU were enrolled in this work in the United States. This army of farm youth is led by 26,000 local leaders of which many of you are a part. I say, don't be ashamed to say you are a booster of our leaders for tomorrow. We 4-H clubbers who come to the college Of agriculture are not ashamed to say that we are still 5-Hers. This is why we have the University of Nebraska 4-H club. "I hope you gain much from these meetings this week and that you will go back to your homes determined to make a bigger and better 4-H club program for this coming year." Jesse Livingston, who was Nebraska's first 4-H boy delegate to the International Leaders Training School at Springfield, Massachu - setts, said: "The International Leaders Training School was held at Spring - field, Massachusetts, September 7 to 20. It was made possible by the efforts of Mr. Horace A. Moses. Mr. Moses was born and raised on .a farm. He is now a wealthy paper manufacturer. "For several years he has been giving trophies to outstanding 4-H leaders throughout the country. He has also been directly con - nected with Camp Vail. Camp Vail is the annual exhibition and en - campment of 4-H club members from the thirteen New England States. From observation made at Camp Vail, Mr. Moses first conceived the idea of starting a leaders training school. The first school was held in 1923, each of the New England States being invited to send one delegate. The next year each state of the original ones was invited to send one boy and one girl, and each year since then five additional states have been invited to send delegates. This year 38 states and G provinces of Canada were represented, making a total of 83 persons. In two more years, all the states of the union will have been invited and In the future they hope to have foreign countries represented. "The average age of the delegates was 21 years. They traveled a total of 174,000 miles, which is equal to six times around the globe. "The training school itself 1b a school for the making of better leaders. The first week consisted of class work and group meetings. In tpe morning of each day, we listened to three prominent persons. </seg>
            <seg id="p372">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Dr. Paul J. Kruse of Cornell University, talked to us on Influencing Human Behavior. He told us how to get results by doing certain - things. Then Walter Burr, of the University of Missouri, talked upon Developing Community Leadership. Miss Ella Gardner gave us some valuable hints on games which can be played at 4-H meetings and parties and how to conduct these. games. The afternoons consisted of group meetings in preparation for a field trip to Connecticut, which we took on Friday. "In the evenings we all attended camp fire. These were usually in charge of groups from different sections of the country. There the different delegates told us something of how club work is being carried on in their states. "When we took the field trip we visited the school . children and their parents and put Into practice some of the things which we had learned at the training school. "It is hard to tell all that I got from this trip. But several of the more important things are — to obtain the best results you must know what results you wish to obtain, and the nature of. the group with which you are working; also, that the purpose of leaders is not only to lead others but also to teach the people to lead themselves."

But when Bhe got to the camp and saw how interesting it was she saw fit to stay with us an hour. She was so delighted with the camp that she invited all the boys and. girls to her home in the White House. Here in the dining room 4-H Club boys and girls were served punch and wafers from the White House servants. This was the first and only organization ever given this privilege. . "The first time Mrs. Hoover ever allowed her voice to be recorded in any movitone was when she presented the most representative 4-H Club boys and girls with trophies. "President Hoover, after having posed for his picture with all the boys and girls at the camp, posed again by himself so that those who wished could take his picture on their own cameras. "The Secretary of Agriculture saw fit to pay a personal visit to the camp. "All three divisions of the government, executive, legislative and judicial, were represented by speakers before the morning meetings. "Chiles restaurant, where many executives eat, is secured each year for the club folks. "4-H Clubs are the first and only organization ever allowed to ramp on the White House lawn. The first year they were there, a custodian tried to get them off, not knowing they had been given permission to camp, which was then an unheard of privilege. "Sonie little honors that I happen to know about are to Ne - braska. We presented Mrs. Hoover with one of our 4-H caps which she was very pleased to receive. Nebraska's tent only was visited by Mrs. Hoover. Nebraska delegation was recognized by a sister of Governor Bryan's. "Because people at the head of our nation pause in their work to recognize 4-H Club work and its worth we are able to have a better understanding of its real importance and value." Helen Smrha gave the following report: "During the last few years, 4-H Club work has rapidly gained more and more recognition. It is now a nationally recognized organ - ization, and, as such, it must really be worth while. The National Club Camp at .Washington, Club Congress at Chicago, and many other national meetings of 4-H Club folks, are things that go to prove the 4-H work is receiving recognition. Trips to the Club Congress are given to deserving club members by various railroad companies, large retail stores, state associations, and various organizations. During the week the club folks are in Chicago, that city puts itself out to entertain them. The Chicago police will even hold up traffic on one </seg>

Banquets are given In honor of these young folks, and they are also entertained by sev - eral business concerns. All of these facts show more clearly that 4-H Club work is not a small organization, but a large one, doing good work all over the country, and this good work Is being ac - knowledged. "Some of you may ask, "Just what is this good work the clubs are doing?' One reason that the clubs are organized is for the purpose of giving the young folks an opportunity to learn about any certain project, such as cooking, sewing, poultry, baby beeves or gardening. The clubs also provide a fine place for the training of boys and girls to become good citizens. This is done by developing qualities such as leadership, dependability, and good sportsmanship. Club folks learn how to meet other people and how to be able to talk before them. Club meetings and other club activities give the boys and girls a fine place to have a lot of good, wholesome fun. "4-H Clubs promote the 4 H's — Head, Heart, Hands and Health. Don't you think it would be worth while to have a 4-H Club in your community if you do not have any there now? Once they are organ - ized you will wonder why you did not think of organizing some before.

A good picture can give to a room more character and atmosphere than anything else in the room. "Pictures represent our taste in art just as the books we choose to own represent! our taste in literature. "If the printing press has brought about the democracy of learn - ing, the camera is responsible for spreading pictorial art. The inven - tion of the camera has made possible the numerous reproductions that we have. "With so many pictures it is little wonder that we are not dis - criminating in our choice or that we have little appreciation for really good pictures. "The quantity and quality .of pleasure to be derived from pic - tures depends upon the point of view of the individual. "If a person has a fact loving mind he will see pictures properly labeled and dated. Slave Ship, Turner — Joseph Mallard 1775-1851 A. D., etc., because be loves statistics. </seg>

            <seg id="p376">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "Some people appreciate pictures from the point of view 01 me emotionally minded. Any picture Is made familiar by constant study. One might acquire the lingo of the studios, all the vocabulary of the art critics, all the phrases used by the historians of art without a shred of knowledge as to the artist's problem or his success in its solution. "If we would learn to really appreciate pictures with a well balanced mind, we should see the pictures as the painter himself sees them in his efforts to express the beautiful. "Learning to see and enjoy beauty in nature is a great help to an appreciation of pictures — beautiful color — grasses — distances — beautiful lines — trees. Even trees without the leaves in the winter are beautiful from an art standpoint if we can but see it. "The great painter rarely paints what he sees. He selects and chooses and arranges. Being more sensitive than we are he is thrilled by combinations of color, arrangments of dark and light, by related masses and contrasting textures which he paints into harmonies, non - material, spiritual — something beyond real facts. "Our enjoyment of pictures Is greater If we can study the artist's way of working; just as the poet is limited, because he can use words only — and the musician because he uses audible tones only, so is the painter limited to pigments applied to a flat surface nf limited areas. "He is limited also because -of the element of time. A poem or a symphony unfolds gradually. The mind Is led from one thought to another, one mood to another until the climax unforeseen at first reveals Itself with thrilling splendor. The picture can present but a single moment. Everybody should paint to understand, but unless one is a real artist, one shouldn't attempt to use the results as the decoration for walls. A chair may be ugly but If it Is comfortable, it. has a reason for being — this Is not true of a picture. A picture must be good art. "Another way to develop an appreciation of pictures Is with the camera. Thousands of men and women have come Into a genuine appreciation of pictures through their failures in photography. The glass eye sees too much or too little. The amateur essays to get a picture of the bride and gets only a white gown — a bit of beautiful landscape turns out to be a desolate road leading to nothing. The eye of the observer is treated like Old Mother Hubbard's long suf - fering dog. In a work of art the eye never experiences this tragedy. Every element helps to lead the eye to the worth while object. "To appreciate pictures: "1. Open mindednesB, a responsive spirit, a sensitiveness to the beautiful things of two worlds — the world of nature and the world of spirit. </seg>

"3. Collect pictures, study them; as a knowledge of art is based on visual discrimination. Learn all you can about the artist, etc. "4. Try to get an aesthetic thrill through the adjustment of areas, hues, values and colors, as the subject has nothing to do with a real work of art. The aim of art is not to imitate nature, not . illustrate literature, not to instruct — nor is it prettiness or beauty in the popular sense. "No one can choose your pictures for you, because one's apprecia - tion is a personal thing based on one's feelings, experiences, sincerity, love of nature, horses, humans, etc. If you do not like any assembled here, you are not hopeless. These were selected merely as suggestions and to talk about. One of the delights In picture study comes through discovering the artist's method of impressing the significance of the picture upon us. Pictures should not only be properly chose, but properly framed and hung.'" THIS LEGISLATURE AND WOMEN'S INTERESTS Mrs. Leroy Davis "Over 1,0.00 bills will be introduced in this legislature before the last day of legislature," said Mrs. Davis. She spoke of the difficulties in presenting the subject and that remarks must lie in the realm of prophecy, and what constitutes "women's interests?" She said the things in which they are most interested are: 1. Taxation. 2. Bonds vs. gas tax &gt; for road building. 3. Modifying or abolishment of code bureaus, change in judi - ciary system, amendment ol primary law. 4. Welfare legislation which is divided as follows: a. County welfare unit. b. Adequate appropriation for children's bureau. c. State care of delinquent, dependent atld defectives. "These last are commonly supposed to be of prime interest to women in government, while the prime interest of men lies in the field of economics and political organizations, therefore it must follow since we are reasonably bright, that we can't expect the men to fight our battles for us so we have supported and elected good women, leaders of women, to sit on the political committees, to sit in the legis - lature and occupy administrative offices carrying into government that </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION special gift which we are supposed to have of seeing the humanitarian side of every question and saying to the men with whom they serve, 'I represent a group of voters who want the welfare interests in gov - ernment adequately financed and intelligently administered' and since fear is the only thing that makes a politician function, fear of the supporters of that woman will cause her to be listened to and our measures gain a degree of success. Of course you are already saying 'Oh, don't be silly' because when we look about us for these women representatives we find them noticeably absent from the scene. "The very small number of women in public office are almost without exception made up of two classes, either the widows or daugh - ters of defunct officeholders, of 'yes-women' who gained their office by working for men and men's interests and usually women and the measures urged by women's organizations are anathema to them. "Now it must follow that we are really not sincere in our interest In welfare measures or else we are too stupid to get what we want and that last I will never subscribe to. Being then rather disillusioned I have chosen to bring before you a review of all of the measures regardless of what field they lie in, that I think will occupy much of the time and attention of the 1931 legislature." Some of the bills to come before the present legislature which were mentioned by Mrs. Leroy Davis are as follows: The Reapportionment Act — This proposes to eliminate 27 men from Congress. Nebraska will lose one man and the other states according to the number of men they have In Congress. The Lame Duck Amendment — This proposes that the men elected to Congress in November will take office before December of the next year, eliminating the payment of salaries to men for a year previous to their actual term of office. The State Income Tax. Road Building — Adding one cent to the tax for gasoline rather than bond the people for the building of paved roads in Nebraska. Increase of Filing Fee for Public Office — Proposal to increase the fee for filing for public office to ?100 per person. Amendment on Primaries — That primaries should be held in the towns and villages the same as in the cities. Removing Party Circle — That there should be a circle to be marked" after each name rather than voting the straight ticket.

            <seg id="p385">. NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7 — AFTERNOON Miss Margaret Fedde, chairman of the home economics depart - ment presided at the afternoon meeting. Mrs. Gaines led in a brisk community sing. Miss Fedde then introduced Hon. Duncan Marshall of Toronto, Canada, who said: "It took the government many years to learn that the farmer had wives and daughters until now there are as many meetings for women as for men. In the old days the wife stayed at home and did all her own work and much of the work of the men while the men went to town or other places of enjoyment. The auto and radio have contributed greatly to home comfort on the farm. Now a woman can go to town in the car with her husband and return to her home duties without being all worn out and wasting a lot of time on the road. During all the pioneer days no one member of the family suf - fered such hardships as did the wives and mothers for the sake of their families. Is it any wonder that those mothers would say that they hoped their boys would get an education and not have to slave on the farm all their lives as she did. These hardships in the past have prejudiced women against the farm and have injured farming. But during the last ten years people have been awakening to a realiza - tion of the possibilities and pleasures and privileges of living on the farm and that it is so much greater than in the towns and cities. Some people wish to move to town and have things, but if they could realize it, it Is much better to have conveniences and live on the farm and be independent. "One great ambition of the human race is to build a home some place. If you do not have a home, you have a hard time going through this world. It costs as much to build a home in the city as it does on the farm and when the home owner in the city is out of work as are many laborers and skilled men at this time, the home will produce interest and taxes just the same and there is no money to pay them with when the earnings are wiped out. A man on the farm finds in these times that he can produce enough to keep his family in reasonably good circumstances and they also have the pleas - ure of living on the farm. "I have always been opposed to farmers retiring to towns. I could understand why the man who has lived in the crowded city all his life would retire to the country to live out his last days, but not the other way. Our education has something wrong with it that causes this condition. How much teaching do we have in our schools of the delights of nature. If you have an opportunity to take a trip across the country, you will find the rural beauty of the country is wonderful. In England or Scotland, a farmer will stop on the hillside and ask you to look at that view when he is showing you his farm. </seg>
            <seg id="p386">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This gives pleasure and joy to his family every day of the world and they make the most of it. We do not get the joy which we should out of the beautiful scenery in the country about us and our children grow up with the idea of getting into town as quick as they can. Get them to appreciate and understand that after all the farmer and his family have privileges that belong to no one else and enjoy health and strength that only the country can give to one. Get the children to understand that the farmer belongs to a class that is superior. "In a certain portion in the south part of Ireland there is a group of people on fine land but they are not making a success of agriculture and are complaining because they Seel they do not possess the freedom they should have and have no spirit of work. On the other hand, there is a .place in Scotland where poor gravel hills had been converted into great fields. These men believed in their job. They had land hunger and wanted to live and produce on their land livestock that would be superior and they did it. The viewpoint is everything. "Living in the country gives people a splendid privilege in raising their families. The influence of the mother Is the greatest in the lives of any family. If the mother has an ambition that the children shall do so and so, they generally do that thing. She wants them to have healthy bodies and there is no better place than the farm to acquire this. "When a boy is trying to secure work in the city, there is no better recommendation can be given for him than that he was brought up on the farm. It is not possible to keep all of our boys and girls on the farm, but we want to keep the cleverest ones there. Great cities would have died from rottenness long, since, but for the good red blood pumped into these cities from the agricultural districts. "A woman should have a big share in the business on the farm and should . know what business is being done and what money is being made. If the man would give the money he spends on his clothes to the woman, she would buy two suits for the price he . gives for one. The woman has a love for her home and a desire to stay there and accumulate enough so they will own that farm and stay' during their lifetime. I am glad we are living in an age when women and men are on the same equality. A woman hates debts. I would like to put it into the hearts of men to fear debt as women do. Farmers have been able to borrow money too easily. They have spread themselves over so much territory they can't gather themselves up again. Let the women hold the purse and the men will be much better for it. There is only joy for the farmer who is out of debt and in - dependent. If farmers kept this in mind and would take their wives advice and not go In debt on their land, it would avoid depression. The farm home is the growing institution of the nation. </seg>
            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "There is a Scottish cattleman In Scotland who breeds superior Aberdeen stock. He is very proud of his stock and glad to show them to anyone who is interested. During the week, if you were visiting him, his whole thought and interest would be taken up with his stock and his pride in them, but if you stayed over Sunday you could not see the cattle or discuss them, but you would need to go to church and hear long sermons. Thus he has a well balanced life. An honest man is the noblest work of God." After a restful song led by Mrs. Gaines, Mrs. Mary Swartz Rose, Nutritionist from Columbia University, talked on OM&gt; AND NEW EMPHASIS IN NUTRITION "I am very happy to have the privilege of talking to this group about foods, as food means more to the one who grows it than to anyone else.

"We want to give the second generation a better standard of living than the first. Any diet that won't give you ten generations is not good diet. These new things that we are hearing of just now have come out of a generation of 25 years. Our number of vitamins is not yet complete, but we must use the knowledge which we already have of them to the very best advantage. There is not one of us as well as we could be if we had a better diet — no matter how good our diet is now. We know so much more today about how to use our food to get the best results and we need to put it into practice. We can understand now why a person had abscessed teeth when he would never eat milk, butter, eggs and -vegetables. Professor Sherman says we could increase the life span at least six years by dietary methods alone. This is worth while not only to live longer, but because people feel so much better while they live and are so much happier. "An eleven year old boy who was brought to a clinic in New York City was in an emaciated condition and was listless, indifferent and forlorn looking. After four weeks on the proper diet he was brought back. He was not much fatter, but there was such a differ - ence in the expression on his face. He was not the same boy. In time he will gain in weight, also. "In schools where the children receive proper nourishment there are fewer absences because of illness, fewer colds and less restlessness in the schoolroom. A rural school in Massachusetts which holds the best record in the state was found to have regular extra feedings supervised by nutritionists throughout the winter. Good food not only increases the appetite, but it produces smoother skin and softer hair. Physicians are not quick .to notice differences between people who are fairly well. They are used to taking care only of sick people. A man who had been watching 500 people who were not sick was surprised to note the striking contrast between the persons who had a quart of milk, eggs, lettuce and cooked fresh vegetables every day and those who lacked these things in their diet. The individuals who had the correct diet were more alert and the difference in the texture of the hair and skin was marked. It is easy to keep alive, but a different matter to be at our best. "There was a man who decided he wished to raise peaches, so bought a tree and planted it. It grew and blossomed and finally produced small peaches which he was very much pleased with because they were the first peaches he had ever raised. One day a specialist in raising peaches visited this man and the man proudly showed him his peaches. The peach grower was thoroughly disgusted with the small gnarled fruit which the man showed him and he showed his dis - pleasure. He was used to producing only the best and was satisfied </seg>

"We have the knowledge at every hand, but it will do no good unless it is applied. In a Filipino school the children were asked to write essays about beri-beri, a disease which is common in that country due to the use of polished rice instead of the unpolished. Two of the girls who wrote the most beautiful essays died of the very disease afterward. Here was an example of knowledge that did no good. "The Dean of the Dental College of Columbia University says that up to the age of 25 he had much grief with decayed teeth caused by unbalanced diets up to that time. He corrected his diet and was amazed at the results in his teeth in the years following. "Milk contains calories, protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron and vitamin A. B and C. Anyone having one pint of milk a day can settle the calcium question for that day. The apple containing large amounts of vitamin C helps children's teeth to develop. An orange has seven times as much of the same chemical in it. The banana is equally as good as the apple. Peas and carrots are very valuable. "The knowledge of foods is to be had. It is for the healing of the nations." MASTER FARM HOMEMAKEIt RECOGNITION The second master farm homemaker presentation was held in con - nection with the meetings of Organized Agriculture on January 8, 1931. Miss Mary-Ellen Brown, State Home Demonstration Leader, was in charge. In her introduction of Miss Lucile'Reynolds of the Farmer's Wife, Miss Brown said: "I think we have been looking forward to this afternoon because of having Miss Reynolds here, and because we know some of our own farm women are here, and to think what the movement means to all of us. "When you stop to think of the place that means the most to you, it is the home, and homemaking is such an important part to the home, so we are just so happy to come to the place when we will have the five women here who have been selected. "The women who were selected this afternoon were nominated by their neighbors. A book with about 1,000 questions was sent to them to fill out. These books have been gone over very carefully, and . from the visitations these women have been selected. We are sure they are not the only good homemakers in Nebraska. They are some of the people who were nominated by their friends. We are happy that Nebraska is one of the 20 states that is doing this thing. </seg>
            <seg id="p390">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE "This fall we had a fine opportunity to work with Miss Reynolds when she was here to work with the committee, so I am glad to have Miss Reynolds talk to you about the work that is being done in these twenty states." Miss- Reynolds: "Friends of Nebraska: It is a real pleasure to come to you this afternoon. Miss Brown has told a little about our work. The real difficulty is when we go about to make these visits that we can only give recognition to five women. As Miss Brown has told you, the work is carried on in 20 states in cooperation with the Extension Services. South Carolina is the farthest south and east, North Dakota on the north and west. Last year we had a very good time in Texas, which is the south and west border, and Vermont is on the north and east. "Each one of the women who is considered for this honor is nominated by five of her neighbors. I feel that this is an honor, for what your neighbors think about you is important. "We have women write to our office to know what the require - ments are. We write back and tell her she has to be nominated by her neighbors. When the nomination blanks come in, we send out a questionnaire, which has 500 questions. These questions filled out give us a picture of the woman. We get an idea of her standards, how her time is spent and how money is used in her home. We get a picture of her health and food habits. How they educate their chil - dren and whether they are growing with their children. Is it a family in which each member participates? "One sheet of the questionnaire deals with the women's activities in her community, with her church, her neighbors, extension work, club work, and schools. Some women do not do themselves justice on this questionnaire; they are too modest to tell about themselves and their family. If we could visit many of these women whose work is high scoring, I am sure they would be eligible for consideration. "There is another section of the questionnaire concerning elec - tricity in the home. This section scores one hundred of the one thous - and points. We feel that there are many women that are fine home - makers that do not have modern conveniences, who are worthy. We would like to think that all women had modern conveniences. Fifty - one per cent have running water, according to the 1920 census. Less than one-half have modern conveniences. Some have children who are ready for college and they have to educate their children beforp they can have these modern conveniences. "We like to come to Nebraska, and have to draw lots to see who comes." Miss Brown then introduced Mrs. J. B. Flchter, chairman of the Nebraska State Guild of Master Farm Homemakers who welcomed the new Master Farm Homemakers as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION •"It is my privilege on behalf of the members of the Ne u »ioau State Guild of Master Farm Homemakers, to tell you how pleased we are to have you as our guests this afternoon. Therefore, we bid you welcome. We extend to you the key. of friendship of our hearts, and we open wide the t"oor of our hospitality. Enter, abide for a while with us, and when these social hours have passed away, and you have gone to your several homes, take with you our sincere wishes of God speed. Again we welcome you to our circle." Miss Brown then said: "This movement is far reaching in Nebraska and we thought Mr. Brokaw would be the one that could talk on that topic this afternoon." Mr. Brokaw: "I am particularly pleased to take part in this afternoon's pro - gram, not because of anything more that I have to say, but because I am pleased to take part In the movement that recognizes the greatest asset that we have in Nebraska — the farm home. "The farm home is responsible for the welfare of Nebraska, so when one thinks of the word Agriculture, that includes the farm home. "We think in terms of farm family out on the farm, and we realize fully what it means to have high ideals and this movement establishes high ideals, so I am pleased to take part this afternoon. "On my first contact with the Master Farm Homemaker's score card, I was a little concerned about it, but found it all right. It has been my privilege to visit a lot of homes in Nebraska and I realize the importance of such influence that this is having in building, be - cause it is high ideals that build for the home, so I have learned to have much respect for it. "I knew a number of men at the Master Farmers' banquet last night, and there was a lot of fellows there that I would like to have told some little things that would put them over the top for Master Farmers. Competition is getting keener and keener. We are building more Master Farmers, and through this movement we will build more Master Homemakers. "Many- of you know the influence of a good home. You know what it meant to you. We lose sight of this thing and sometimes we need to have this thing called back to us. I am gratified to help in a movement that means home life. If it is your privilege to fill out a questionnaire sometimes, I hope that you will do it in a conscientious way. "I am inclined to get off my topic just a little. What is the rela - tion to Extension Service? It is setting our standards higher which we are building. We want to make our farm a better place for our boys- and girls. That is our Idea of agriculture. A model farm home </seg>
            <seg id="p392">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is not exactly a model home, that isn't the word that fits — it is a comfortable farm home, one that makes you feel a delight in having a home." Miss Brown then introduced Dean Burr who spoke on "What the Movement Means to the College." "Master Homemakers, Friends: I am very much interested in the Master Homemakers' Movement. I believe it presents the same relation to the home that the Master Farmer Movement does to agriculture, and I believe that we are now beginning to feel the effect of the Master Farmers' Movement, and that within a short time we will feel the effect of the Master Farm Homemakers' Movement. "Twenty-flve years ago it was a commonly accepted truth that anyone could farm. If a boy showed an aptitude we educated him for a profession, medicine, law or what-not. If he showed no par - ticular aptitude for either, it was taken for granted that he was going to farm. That time has changed, and the home is coming to the same change that agriculture went through. "Of the people that have given the most service, the Homemaker is the most important. "We can train minds and we can create aptitudes, but the prin - ciples of good citizenship will continue in the home. Homemaking to my notion is the most worthy cause to which we can give consid - eration. I urn proud of this movement. The Master Homemaker cause, I believe, will reveal to the state that Homemaking is a profession. It is far more than a profession, it is the heart-throb of society. "By this recognition, we will begin to talk about Homemaking. It may not change the habits of those that have reached mature years, but it is going to improve the younger generation,, that will be the Homemakers of tomorrow. Anyone that will cause them to think about it, to study it, will feel that it is an outstanding privilege and will help. "The influence of the home is impossible to measure; therefore I do congratulate these ladies. The greater effect will come in this next generation. These young people that are coming on now will give more serious thought to the responsibility of homemaking than has been given by the generation in the past, and I believe that it will be felt in both the union and state. "I had in mind saying to Miss Fedde and her co-workers that if this could be discussed in some periods to the students in Home Economics department, not from the mere fact that someone won an honor or something, but that the lesson could be drawn to them of the real value of homemaking. A home is not just beautiful rugs on nice floors. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "I am very glad Indeed to say this, that we here at the University do appreciate the movement and we feel that you are going to serve a purpose." Miss Brown: "I am bo happy that Nebraska can present these five women. They are: Mrs. H. L. Capwell, Elmwood, Cass County. Mrs. D. S. Anderson, Lexington', Dawson County. Mrs. E. L. Cooley, Waverly, Lancaster County. Mrs. Jacob Norrls, Laurel, Cedar County. Mrs. James W. Miller, Beaver Crossing, Seward County." II i^ : iill BwEhB I Miss Reynolds then gave the following facts based upon the Master Farm Homemaker score card: NEBRASKA MASTER FARM HOMEMAKER SCORE CARD I. Farm Home Plant 100 points II.

            <seg id="p396">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The physical examinations (or the children are a part of the program for the children in most of these families and two dental examinations a year are listed by four of the women. IV. RECREATION, SOCIAL, DEVELOPMENT AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS MRS. ANDERSON — In answer to the question, "What is your greatest personal ambition?" she says: "To have a harmonious, happy, contented family and be respected by my friends. Also to be able to keep pace with my children as they advance. - My home is first, though I am Interested in everything." "How do you measure success in homemaklng?" "A woman is successful In homemaking if she succeeds in bring about an attrac - tive, interesting home; if she raises a family of high moral standards, high Christian standards, individuals who are interested in making themselves useful men and women." MRS. CAPWELL — "How do (or did) you train the children In business methods. "Mary had own checking account when away to high school. Both have had small allowances since they were 6 years old, increasing when they are older." "What do you think constitutes success?" "To be a success one must attain some goal.

COOLEY — "What do you and your husband believe to be the real function or functions of your home?" "The real function of our home is to raise our children to be useful citizens, to take part in the work of the world. Our "job" is to provide the 'setting' and the example for such citizenship." "What is your greatest personal ambition?" "My greatest per - sonal ambition is to keep our home in such a way that on looking back in future years the children will remember not the cleanliness of it, nor yet the untidiness, but the comfort, the pleasures, the peace, the comradeship, the joys of their years spent in the home. This may not be what is meant by 'personal' ambition, but since I could not be a musician, a painter or a poet if I wanted to, and since I do not aspire for a career of any kind, and since my main job Is that of home - maker, I believe this is truly a personal ambition." MRS. MILLER — "How do you use reading as a part of your homemaking?" "Good reading adds culture. ' I encourage the read - ing of books that require careful reading — that challenge our thought. No home is complete without books for books in themselves are a self-educating unit, inspiring the growing mind with absorbing thoughts and clean, wholesome ideas." </seg>

"All business is talked over between us and decided. The responsibility of rearing and training the children was assumed by both of us. Our standard of living is worked out between us in keeping within our income." "What are you doing to give spiritual training in the home?" "Spiritual training should be emphasized. The attendance of Sunday School and Church and the singing of sacred songs encouraged. Rea - lizing full well my moral obligation to my children and living my own life with a spirit of reverence of all things that are holy. As an example, our library contains religious literature." MRS. NORRIS — "How are you teaching the children to enjoy and appreciate the things of country living?" "Their father and I like the country so well they just seemed to grow up to like everything on the farm and now the girls are so glad to get home to the farm for a few days." "What is your greatest personal ambition?" "To be a good wife and mother, a good homemaker, a good neighbor. To do all I can to help my community to be a better place in which to live." "How do you hope to spend your old age?" "On the farm. I hope I can live to be 100 years old and able to take care of myself and my home and flowers. I want to do so many things that I haven't had. time to do before. I hope I will never get to be a cross old lady." V. COMMUNITY WORK MRS.

"I have taken part in Farmers' Club programs (this is purely a social' organization), and in P. T. A. programs, both the program part and the social part. My husband and I, with the help of our banker, backed financially the publishing of a history of our community. Different people wrote dif - ferent sections of it, but I planned it and did the proof reading and had it printed. This was four years ago. Now I am on a committee to write a supplement to bring it up-to-date." </seg>
            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mrs. Cooley was president of the local Parent-Teacher Associa - tion two years; member of executive board three years. Secretary and Treasurer of the District P. T. A. for five years, recently re-elected for another two-year term. Has been president of the "Women's Ex - tension Club one year, project leader one year and now re-elected for one more year. The Cooleys held the first meeting of the Farmers' Club In their home fifteen years ago and helped organize It. Mrs.- Cooley served on program committee last year. Is country home and community chairman of Farm Bureau. MRS. MILLER — "How much time have you spent in the school the past year observing the regular school work?" "I have no children in school, but viBited several times last year." "What have you done in the past two years to make your com - munity a better place to live, including recreation, beautiflcatlon, school improvement, etc.?" "I am an active member of the Beaver Crossing Federated Women's Club whose aim Is civic improvement, also spon - sors a local library; a Christmas community tree and program; educa - tional programs.

Is vice president of County School Board Association. She says of her club work: "I find club work very educational and I feel I learn so much by meeting with the dif - ferent groups of ladles. I love to work with different types of people. I am sure it keeps one from getting, too self-centered. I like to see how people do things. I like the school work, although 1 have no children in school; I am so interested la each child. We have a very fine school." Miss Reynolds then gave the beautiful charge and presented the Master Farm Homemaker pins to each woman, explaining its sig - nificance and following this each woman responded briefly. Following is Mrs. Capwell's response: "I wish first to thank Mrs. Reynolds as a representative of 'The Farmer's Wife,' and the University Extension Department for the honor conferred upon me today. "I wish I had the confidence In my ability as a homemaker that my family and five of my loyal neighbors had in me when these neigh - bors presented my name as candidate for these honors. "I feel very unworthy of the honor for I know so many fine women, who as yet have not been named but who are real masters of their job, that of homemaking. "I owe whatever success I have been first to a Master Farm Mother, who was my first nurse, my first teacher In community service, my first example of Christian Motherhood. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "With a mother like that I should be most ungrateful If I did not rise above some of the inconveniences found in every farm home, and render some service to those not so well situated, those who have not had the advantages that I have had. "I have three more reasons for my success, my husband and two daughters, one now teaching In a rural school, the other a junior in high school, the time I first received the questionnaire they were positive that I would be one of the honored ones, and I wonder if, when Miss Reynolds and Miss Brown called on us this fall, if It was not the hypnotic influence exercised upon them by my husband and the girls, that really won for me, my place here today. ""You might like to know some of the things my husband does to make it possible for me- to find time for more community effort. He always keeps the car in good running order, the tires pumped up and my shoes s'hined so that I am ready to go on a moment's notice. "At a round table conference of club presidents this fall Miss Brown suggested that we enumerate some of the joys and privileges of being a club president. "It might be worth while to think of some of the joys of being a Master Farm Homemaker. First, this most delightful week at organized Agriculture the guest of the Farmer's Wife. The lovely luncheons and feasts and the companionship of these women, who are interested in the same work we are in. "There is the pride of one's family and the strengthening of con - fidence in ourselves which we so often need. "We need to check up occasionally and see if we are stressing the most essential things in life, those things which help raise the standards of homemaking, either on the farm or elsewhere. "Whatever I can do that will raise these standards and will make this world a better place to rear children in I shall be pleased to do. My capability, may not be much, but I do have a desire to serve." Mrs. Anderson spoke as follows: "I wish to thank the Farmer's Wife, Miss Reynolds and the Ex - tension people, also the friends who made it possible for me to be honored in this manner. I hope some time to be able to add a bit of pleasure to your lives. "If I have been a success in any way I did not know it. I need to think of my husband and girls, as homemaking is not just house keeping. It takes a co-operative Christian spirited family and a host of friends. I feel fortunate my life has been surrounded " by these conditions. "The questionnaire is well worth studying by anyone. The more I studied it the more interested I became. It represents such high </seg>
            <seg id="p400">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE sutuuards and ideals. It gave me several new thoughts such as how wonderful It would be it we could take the knowledge and experience we have gained through the years, how much easier and better work we might do. "Miss Reynolds, I wish to thank you for these beautiful flowers and lovely pin. I am sure I can apply In the future some of the benefits I have gained in this event, and will try to live up to the standards it represents." Mrs. Cooley: "While I am very proud to receive this honor, I have the feeling that I am taking something which does not belong to me. No one person can make a real home. It takes the co-operation of the whole family — father, mother and children. I am sure if it had not been for the help of the rest of my family, I should not be here. In raising a family of six children on a farm, a mother could very easily put in her whole time just attending to the dally needs, such as get - ting meals, sweeping, washing, ironing, etc., but to be a Master Farm Homemaker she must do more than that. She must train the minds and souls of the children, must play with them, and must take some part in community activities. This I never could have done If my family had not been willing to 'put up' with some inconveniences many times. "When one of the older children spoke of my coming to Lincoln for three days, my six-year-old son said, 'Who will see if my face is clean, or ask me if I have a handkerchief?' A mother has to be on the job either directly or indirectly the. greater part of the time. "In receiving this honor, I do not feel that I have accomplished something so much as that I, as well as my family, have taken on added responsibility, the responsibility of living up to the reputation , of Master Farm Homemaker. As years go by, I hope I may become more worthy of the honor conferred upon me today." Mrs. Miller: "I wish to express thanks to the Farmer's Wife magazine and the Agricultural Extension Service of the University of Nebraska for the honor just bestowed upon me in the presentation, by Miss Rey - , nolds, of this pin of recognition as a Master Farm Homemaker. "I am very proud and happy to be one of the second group of Master Farm Homemakers selected from Nebraska. I wish to express heartfelt gratitude to the friends and neighbors of my community for the high compliment paid in selecting me as their representative for this year. "With divine help I hope to always be worthy of the honor and it will be an incentive to push onward and upward, striving always for the higher and nobled things of life. </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "The credit for any success I may have attained, I place first with my parents who. were each a Master Farmer and a Master Farm Homemaker, although no publicity recognized as such as is being done today. And, also, to my husband and children for their co - operation, always toward the best Interests of the home. "To Miss Reynolds, I express my sincere appreciation for every - thing she has done for comfort and entertainment while we have been her guests here. "These days will be treasured among the happy memories of my life." Mrs. Norris: "I wonder if I look as happy as I feel. If I was in a broad grin contest just now I am quite sure I would win the prize. We are having a wonderful time. Miss Reynolds and Miss Brown are royally entertaining us. Mrs. CapweTl told us how her husband kept her shoes shined. That is something I had never thought of. As soon as I go home that will be one more thing for my husband to do for -me. I wish to thank my neighbors that nominated me, also the Extension Service and the Farmer's Wife for this recognition. I feel this is a great honor and it carries with it responsibilities. 1 hope in return for this courtesy I may extend to my community some help in raising the standards of all homes so in time we may be a community of Master Farm Homemakers. I shall proudly wear this little pin. In accepting it I feel I have accepted the responsibility of showing the world what a Master- Farm Homemaker means. I feel I can never measure up to what this pin really means, but am going to keep on trying every day in every way." THURSDAY, JANUARY 8 Forenoon The president, Mrs. E. P. Noyes, presided at the morning meeting which was opened with the "Hello" song led by Miss Muriel Smith. Mrs. Anna Dee Weaver of the Nebraska Farmer then talked on WHAT THE MAIL BRINGS "All my life I have wanted to get letters. When I was a little girl, my sisters and I would go up over the hill and watch for the mailman. We could see his white wagon glistening in the sun about a mile down the road and the time seemed endless before he reached us. He was a kind old man with chin whiskers. He looked some - thing like Uncle Sam himself. More often than not, he would poke </seg>
            <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE his head out of the mail wagon and look at us through one glass in his spectacles and over the other, and say, 'Nothing today, little girls, but the paper.' We were not interested in the paper; we wanted a letter. From whom, I do not know, but a letter anyhow. "About that time, the picture postcard came into its own. At school I would boast, 'I have six picture postcards.' But it I had six, someone else always had seven. In some magazine were postcard exchanges. You sent a postcard showing the picture of William Jen - nings Bryan's home to one whose name appeared in the list and that person sent you a card in return. The first postcard I ever received was a picture of the Congressional Library at Washington. The sender said, 'Thanks for the card, but please do not send any more, as 1 have as many as I can answer.' The joy was taken out oi it. I really did not intend to send another and those lines prevented me from exhibiting the post card from Washington with pride. "But now, at last this childhood desire to get letters has been fulfilled. When I was Mrs. True Homemaker last year, the postman brought me hundreds of letters, interesting ones too. Then, I became Aunt Betty to the children who read the Nebraska Farmer and the postman brings me delightful letters from them. As Home Circle Editor of the Nebraska Farmer, more letters come- from women. "These letters are not mere slips of paper to me. Each one is like a message from a friend, because it represents the home life of a reader. When I answer a letter, I always have a mental picture of the author. I may picture thin women as not so thin, and short women tall, but I like these mental pictures. "Quite recently, a woman wrote to me and said she had four little children, two in school and two below school age. She had lots of work to do, naturally, but she wanted some time of her own every day. Did other women manage, it? Bhe asked. If so, how did they do it? "So I asked for letters and from the many I received I feel sure that many women are handling this problem of leisure time with a certain degree of success. One woman said that she could find work to do if there were twenty-four hours in her day. So she found that if she had a breathing spell in her day, she simply took it and let the work wait. She took a nap, she read, she wrote letters or listened to the radio. Then she said, 'In a half hour or an hour, your con - science will be so guilty that you can do the dishes in half the usual time.' Her letter raised this question, 'Is there not a limit to what we should attempt to do In a day?' "Another said that if we would think, think, think, we would save many steps and many minutes, and thus find time for. leisure. 'Make your head save your heels,' in other words. For instance, when we go to the cellar for the potatoes for dinner, take a tray and bring </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION up a can of fruit, a jar of pickles and some apples. Then wnen supper time comes, we will not need to make that, trip again. If we have too much work, and any woman who cannot find a few minutes .for herself has too much work, perhaps we should not be so particular. Fold the towels, sheets, and work clothes, and much of the under - clothing. Do not iron them. Of course, we will admit that they will looks nicer lying in the drawer if they are ironed shiny smooth, she said, but if it is a question of snatching a few minutes of needed rest or recreation, most of us could use a dish towel with a few wrinkles in it. Pride came forth, of course, because she continued, 'Have a few ironed towels and sheets on hand to use if company comes.' There are other tricks which save time: having the children change their school clothes when they come home from school, mending small tears and rips so they will not grow into large ones, having the children get in the fuel, etc. These are just little tricks, of course, but back of them is thinking, looking ahead, and managing. One woman plans the meals and the other duties for a week ahead. Her plan, due to unexpected guests or other causes, does not always work, but it usually does. "Then, wrote a woman from Dixon county: 'After we get this leisure time, what are we going to do with it? Will we spend more time making fancy dessert and keeping the house cleaner? Should we not spend this time more wisely in resting, perhaps, or reading, or sponsoring a 4-H Club or some other community work?' Mr. Roosevelt once said, 'What you do for yourself, dies when you die; what you do for your community lives after you are gone.' "I receive many, many letters about rearranging the kitchen, and making it more convenient. We can save time in this way, and pre - vent fatigue also. Place the work table near the stove, and make it high enough so that we will not have to stoop over when we wash -dishes. As the. tallest in a family of four girls, I know all about the aches caused by working over low tables. Put blocks under the "table legs. If you wash dishes at a sink, fix a little framework on which to place the dishpan to make it a comfortable height. And what about water in the house? How that helps! A pitcher pump costs about $25.00, that is, if the well is close. A force pump costs more, about $40.00. Would there be a better way to spend $40.00? "I have some friends who have five little children. They have a nice farm, well improved, and they are prosperous. Last summer the mother was ill, and as usual, they could get no one to help with the housework. Wash day came, and the Mr. (that is what she calls him) had to help. He pumped water and pumped water. He did not realize before how much water was required for family washing. Before the next wash day, he had rigged up a barrel on a sled; he filled that barrel from the windmill pump, hitched a horse to It, and hauled it to the house. Now, part of her wash day troubles are </seg>
            <seg id="p404">REPOftT OF KEBfiASKA STATg BOARD OP AGRICULTURE over. Perhaps it would be a good idea to let the Mr. help with the washing once or twice, just for the moral effect. We would not have a successful women's meeting if we did not plot just a little against the men. This family, by the way, drive quite an expensive car. We wonder if they could not be a happier family with a healthier, happier mother if they drove a cheaper car and had water pumped into the house. The extension department has a most interesting bulletin on water systems for the farm home. "A woman who spoke at Western Organized Agriculture at Chadron in December said, 'We homemakers work so that our family will be comfortable and happy. We prepare food they like, we sew, clean, mend, raise garden and chickens. If in doing that we wear ourselves out, if we are cross and tired with never a minute to fix up a bit, to tell the little ones a story, to listen to the fun the otder ones had at school that day, to play and laugh, then we are making our family uncomfortable in our efforts to make them comfortable, and so we have missed our main objective.' "The way In which women make their homes attractive at a low cost is always interesting to me. Many pieces have been brought down from the attic, or rescued from the wood shed to be used again, after being refinished. Commodes, old fashioned and out-of-date, make ideal radio cabinets. Sturdy boxes in "which canned goods are shipped make a cupboard when set lengthwise, three or four deep, nailed together and covered with left-over wall paper. The cost of these is almost nothing. Homemade bookshelves, beds, and dressers made attractive by removing ponderous trimmings, clothes hampers — f" s these are just a few of the improvements which can be made with the paint brush and the dye pot, combined with a little ingenuity and resourcefulness. "Then the letters about children, from one mother to another. How much responsibility should children assume? Should they have an allowance? Why do children hate to wash dishes? I wish all the mothers could read a letter from a little girl in which she said, 'Why must I always help, help, help? Why doesn't mother let me do some - thing all by myself, let me get a meal all alone and not just help?' Isn't it true that children do graduate from the helper stage in some respects? Of course, we are all helpers In a sense, but children like the responsibility of certain tasks. A little praise for work well done is one way of oiling the machinery to make it run smoothly. "Farm children have so many opportunities which town children do not have. I live in a neighborhood of boys and after school their chief occupation is kicking the football. Oil burning furnaces have deprived them of their remaining winter duty. Compare this with the work boys can find to do on the farm. They handle stock and tools at an early age In a way that amazes mothers of town children. </seg>
            <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION They learn lessons of dependability and self reliance which towu wu - dren are denied. Of course, to be fair, we must admit that the town schools give opportunities In music, shop work, manual training, etc., which the one-teacher school cannot offer, but we hope the day is coming, and not far off, when school privileges will be equalized. "One more letter which I want to tell you about because it is on the subject which is dear to the hearts of the editors of the Nebraska Farmer — rural child health. A woman's club in Ouster county last May sponsored a clinic, a clinic at which the little tots were given a physical examination by a child specialist working with the local doctors. The writer said it was a howling success because there were over 100 children examined and 97 of them cried. What that clinic revealed! Almost every child had rickets, the disease which results in bow legs and other bone deformities. One little girl was practically a cripple. Now, most of these little children were well apparently, that is, they were not ill, but they were underweight, caught colds easily, had diseased tonsils, and adenoids. They came from both farm and town. The mothers were . so grateful for the knowledge gained through this clinic, that this woman's club in co - operation with several other organizations, such as P. T. A., extension clubs, social groups, etc., plan to hold a similar clinic next year. Is this not a worthwhile piece of work for any club to sponsor? Health of little children, without a doubt, is the greatest asset of any state. It Is indeed true that Ihe nation marches forward on the feet of little children. "So the letters go. Joy and sorrow, work and play, privation, sacrifice and love. Sometimes I get letters from the children, saying, 'Mama is In the hospital, and I am trying to get the meals.' 'Our house burned and Little Betty's recipe book was lost." 'I have had infantile paralysis and I haven't walked since July.' And then I think, 'How much the rest of us have to be thankful for. Our troubles are nothing compared to those which others bear.' I am glad that these letters come to me, that I can drop a word of encouragement to these children, and that with your help through the Home Circle page, I am able to pass on to women something that will make their home - making job easier, happier and better." Following Mrs. Weaver's talk Miss Grace Morton accompanied by Mr. Phil Jorgensen, sang "A Bowl of Roses" by Clark, a Russian song by Rachmaninoff, and "Such a Little Feller," by Duhmont. Mrs. Mary Swartz Rose then spoke on </seg>
            <seg id="p406">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE TONICS FROM PANTRY AND GARDEN "It is very interesting to be in this phase of our development where dietetic problems are being faced." "About fifty years ago there lived in New England a woman who was very skilled in the gathering and growing of herbs. Many of the people in this day were interested in this but this woman was especially so. She used these herbs for medicine. The Dean of Oxford by chance took her medicine and was cured and therefore she received more than ordinary fame. The physician of the dean, being greatly interested, came to get the secret, but she would not give it up to him. Finally, after much persuasion the money was temptation enough and she sold him twelve herbs. He tried the twelve out, but found that only one was of any value. That one herb was the purple fox glove and the purple fox glove is used now in making a drug. -There are hosts of others just like this which have been used first, and finally with careful chemical work and study a change has made them valuable and of more chief use than in their very crude form. This is the same experience with regard to our food. Some had great reputation. Others like the eleven out of twelve had had the good recognition which they did not deserve and we found this out in the process of sorting these foods and found just what they did signify. Today we use our foods ever so much better than we ever did before. "I am working with, and have been working with them for the past two years, a group of pupils, school children, who are interested in the study of the growth. We began by taking the milk products. Milk has a vast supply of calcium and It is this that chilren must have. Only a chemist can take the calcium out of the milk. Just as the little speck of red oil In the spinach and that speck of red oil has Vitamin A. They ask the question, what is Vitamin A? The only way we can tell what It is and how it works is by experimenting on animals. We learn more about ourselves through animals than in any other way. We found out by experimenting on -white rats that milk is one of our best foods for growth; by giving one pair of white rats milk with all the Vitamin A in it and another pair milk from which all the Vitamin' A had been removed. Anyone, child or parent, can see the difference in a week. Last year some of the students in some way or other mixed the diet we were giving some rats. It soon began to show up in that the animals that were not supposed to grow were growing. They were receiving *his Vitamin A in some unknown way. We discovered that we had put in milk that had a large supply of calcium. We also keep the children interested In other sources from which Vitamin A can be secured. We hear much about spinach, a very excellent dish for Vitamin A. If we should take a dish of spinach and compare it with a glass of milk we would find that more Vitamin A was being taken or received from the spinach </seg>
            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION than from the milk. The reason for this is that the spinach is green. The Vitamin A from our milk is caused from the green. The children ask us very soon as to how the Vitamin A got in the milk. This is very simple when we realize that a cow has to have the green grass. This grass is the source of the Vitamin A in the milk and it is the same with all green foods such as lettuce or dandelion greens, etc. The question was asked as to whether or not yellow string beans had as much Vitamin A in them. No, they do not have as much. They have some, but not nearly so much as the green beans. If you were to take three-fourths of a cup of green beans and compare it with a glass of milk it would be equal in value according to Vitamin A. Of course, the greener the bean, the more Vitamin A in it. Take the lettuce; it is very valuable for its greenness. The outside leaves are the valuable ones. The next color of vegetable is yellow such as the carrot, a true competitor of spinach. It takes only about an inch off the end of a medium sized carrot to produce a great quantity of Vitamin A. I can remember when I was a student, of reading of what Miss Palmer said in regard to carrots. She stated that the only value of a carrot was for garnishing. I wonder what she would think, were she to see the many uses of the carrot today. When asked whether canning would make a difference — Tso, canning makes no difference, unless you throw it away. "The matter of Vitamin A applies even to fruits. Were you to compare a medium sized banana with an ordinary sized plate of lettuce, you would receive the same amount. The tomato compared with the banana has more. The next color we will compare Is the red. This is about the only, red food to compare, the apple. The apple does not have very much vitamin A. It Is no competitor of the banana in that step. Vitamin A is good for growth and you can't have growth without it. It is very interesting to know that you can raise a rat to full adult size on an amount of Vitamin A that will not enable It' to raise a family because it takes more to raise the next generation, therefore we ought to make an allowance for this. In order that we will have a successful new generation we must see that our children have more than enough of Vitamin A to grow on. These animals that have just enough can grow on all the time, but they will not live as long as the other nor will their bodies be as easy to ward off diseases. We should remember to store the body with Vitamin A and keep it up as diligently as we can. Vitamin A spreads all over the body and helps keep you in good health. . If you take or receive too small an amount of this Vitamin A, you don't have as good ha"lr, as good lungs, as good kidneys, as good respiratory tract as you would have had you eaten more foods with Vitamin A. Therefore, we must see that our students have more than just enough to get along with. "We see what that means when we compare or contrast this with the fame of Dr. Adolph. He is where possibilities have become </seg>
            <seg id="p408">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE so great, where it has economic pressure which is so great that they have adapted themselves to live on a narrow margin. They are Just on the margin. Any shortage of food or any increase of work spells disaster. Girls in school preparing for examinations succumb to tuber - culosis. That is what it means to have just enough to get along with. "When we had shown that our animals would grow on Vitamin A, we had not done our whole deal with children. Certainly, children would not thrive on milk alone. Humans need one thing animals do not. Vitamin C. We made a little experiment on guinea pigs. The first pig we gave a bread milk diet. The next a bread milk plus a little raw spinach, the next bread milk plus a little cooked spinach. The one that had no spinach at all was very sick. The one with the raw spinach was growing beautifully and the one with the cooked spinach was well, but was growing very slow. I will say definitely in regard to spinach that it should be cooked just a few minutes. Not more than five at the most. Commercially cooked spinach is much better for us than home cooked. Of all the vitamins the tomato has to contribute the most significant Is Vitamin C. If you put tomatoes in your diet you would have an extra supply. When Harriet Chlch went to Vienna to work with the poor children, one of the experi - ments she worked was for them not to put their vegetables in their soup in the mornings when they left for .the day, but to wait until evening. They found this idea very simple and discovered that it made all the difference in the world. The tomato is considered today as one of our most precious foods. It can be cooked or not, just as you wish. • It does not lose its value either way. It used to be that everyone said, don't give tomatoes to children before they are three years old. Now we are saying, give your children tomatoes as soon as they are born. The chief competitor of the tomato is the orange. One orange compared to one tomato has the same value. One table - spoon of orange juice and one of tomato is practically equivalent. Grape fruit Is also very good for you. One should not cook the apple. It loses all the value of Vitamin C when it is cooked. My first experience along this line, I learned from a monkey. I had never had any practice in . feeding a monkey and all I knew about them was what I had read. I knew monkeys had scurvy, but did not know what It was caused from. I gave my monkey milk and kept it on a hot water bottle and before long it got scurvy. I happened to have some grapes in the house so I thought I would try them. This didn't work and I finally had to keep It on a raw- potato diet. Here I want to say that the potato is another good friend of the human race. It may be cooked or uncooked. I have a lot of respect for the potato. Baked or boiled it has' the same value. "Milk and rice have no connection with one another. Milk will Improve the rice, rice will not improve the milk. </seg>
            <seg id="p409">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION . "I spoke of some of these things about Vitamtn A and C. i couia tell you a long story about Vitamin B -and D — that we depend on the sun and we also take cod liver oil. You can take tablets that will give you large sources of Vitamin D. I would never substitute any - thing for this, unless I was giving very much Vitamin A In some other way, but to be at your best it takes a good deal of Vitamin A. It takes a lot of Vitamin D to have good teeth. It also takes a good deal of Vitamin C for this. A half of a tomato will serve very good for this. We know enough to protect ourselves and we ought to have children with very good teeth. This is not all we must have for our' children. We must have other things. We must have calories. Iron, etc. Calories are very easy to get. They are much cheaper and are In the things our appetites drive us to take. (The question was asked in regard to the value of cod liver oil after It was a little old.) Cod liver oil will be the richest in vitamins when it has not deteriorated. When it is fresh you can be sure it has a good supply. When it gets old it does not have as much, but nevertheless it is of unestimated value. "Sugar is the food that is most popular in America today. It is the last thing for us to take in. It you have any room for sugar after you have eaten everything else it is all right to take it. If not, then it should never be thought of. "The art side of life Is one of love." (Holding up both) "Will you have a piece of angel cake or will you have a glass of milk?

            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Mrs. Tool moved that the report be adopted. Seconder — carried. Miss Fedde explained the situation relative to the much needed building for home economics. Why a New Home Economics Building Is Needed "If you understand a situation can you act on a proposition more intelligently? We believe you can, therefore we are presenting to you some facts for your consideration: "What is the present situation In home economics in the Uni - versity? "You will be Interested to know: "1. That the Home Economics Department consists of five divisions and enrolls approximately one-half of the students in the College of Agriculture and that this large department is housed in a building which was planned as a dormitory twenty-two years ago to house eighty high school girls when the School of Agriculture introduced home economics into its curriculum. "2. That this former dormitory houses not only the classes In home economics but also the cafeteria, dining room, and kitchens which serve In addition to the students in the college of agriculture and In the short courses,: also its other regular patrons, visitors and numerous state groups numbering several thousand each year. "3. That this cafeteria kitchen and dining room built for eighty girls serves from 150 to 500 persons at one meal, and that the size of this kitchen in which these tons of food must be prepared measures only 18x21 — only a little larger than the average farm kitchen in Nebraska. "4. That approximately 145,000 meal's were prepared and served In this kitchen and dining room in 1929. We are serving today over 68,000 meals more in one year than we did five years ago. We are operating above our capacity now and are obliged constantly to refuse service to visiting state groups. "5. That this same cramped kitchen space Is used as a laboratory for training students to become dletitions in hospitals, directors of tea rooms and cafeterias. That we have calls for these trained workers from coast to coast. That more calls are received for these graduates than can be filled. That it costs the University practically nothing for laboratory and supplies to train these' professional women. "6. That because this building houses not only the growing home economics department but also the cafeteria, kitchen and dining room, classes in home economics long ago have been forced into other buildings ' on the campus. In one of these other buildings we now </seg>
            <seg id="p412">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have a textile laboratory In a dark basement room, and in another old building discarded by two other departments the work in house - hold equipment is housed. This department gives instruction and help to Nebraska homemakers on selection and care of all kinds of house - hold equipment. Last year over 500 people in the state visited this department. Work in this building is frequently interrupted because of the noises and odors from slaughtering which occurs in an adjoining wing of this building. "7. That the work in human nutrition must be housed in an - other building isolated from the rest of the work and that the research work In meat testing in co-operation with the animal husbandry de - partment has been crowded into another building. "8. That because the cafeteria dining room is inadequate the home economics laboratories are frequently used as dining rooms for special committee or world forum, groups who wish to discuss problems while eating lunch. For this purpose in 1929 nearly 1,000 persons used these instruction rooms on the second floor and even on the third floor of the home economics building. This frequently interferes with teaching. It also interferes with committee meetings because the rooms are available only between the hours of twelve and one o'clock. "What can you do to relieve this situation? "You can see that the Legislators appropriate money sufficient to build a new home economics hall which will provide adequate space for cafeteria kitchen, store rooms and dining rooms to accommodate comfortably the college students, the. students in short courses, and visitors, and the numerous state groups visiting the campus every week in the year. "The state groups that should be served are: (a) State Fair visitors, 4-H Club members housed and fed dur - ing State Fair week. (b) Feeders days in October and April; approximately 1,000 visitors come each time. (c) Organized Agriculture — when approximately 1,500 persons come to the campus. (d) The state judging contests for two days enrolling 300 boys now and which will probably grow to 1,000. (e) 4-H Club week — now numbering 400. Should reach 1,000 whenever facilities can be provided for feeding them. (f) Short Courses: Dairy, poultry, agricultural engineering. (g) Conventions such as the bankers, the veterinarians, etc., who come to our campus. (h) Extension field days— such as crop days, outlook meet - ings, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p413">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "This new building should also provide: (a) Class rooms and dressing rooms for the classes in insti - tutional management, and class rooms, laboratories, and research rooms for foods classes and for dietetic and human nutrition classes. "Perhaps you do not realize that: "1. At present we are unable to fill the positions for which we have calls because we are unable to expand any more with our present accommodations. That at least twenty-five superintendents in Nebraska this year, (1930) were obliged to go to other states to find their home economics teachers because we could not supply them. "2. That we had during the past year a number of calls for hospital dietitians, tea room and cafeteria managers which we were unable to fill. "3. That young, women from Nebraska are now being attracted to our neighboring institutions because better facilities in home eco - nomics are provided there. Should not Nebraska educate its own citizens? Ames; Iowa, had over 1,000 students registered in Home Economics last year. Manhattan, Kansas, had over 600. Nebraska had 250. These women become professional workers or homemakers in their respective states. What Influence Is this Interest In home economics going to have in the building of homes in these various states — Iowa 1.000. Kansas 600. Nebraska 250? We should have at least 500 students whose major Interest is home economics. "4. That interest in homemaking education Is increasing every - where and as a result new home economics buildings have been erected in the past ten years at Ames, Iowa; Purdue University; State College in Washington; State College In Oklahoma; State College in Michigan; University of Missouri; University of Tennessee; University of Maine; Vassar College, New York; State College in Montana, and that the legislature in New York last year appropriated $1,000,000 for a new home economics building. "Will you see or write your legislators telling them of this need on the Agricultural College campus and urge them to appropriate sufficient funds to erect a new Home Economics Building?" Professor Scott's talk on "Reading as an Adventure" closed the program. "To the young," he said, "reading is valuable as a means for the acqulstlon of a vocabulary, as a means for the acquisition of facts, for the knowledge of past history, for suggestion as to how to be successful. "To mature people It is valuable for information in making a life. The' important business of every person is, is he going to make the </seg>
            <seg id="p414">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE imng he does a success? It helps him . to know how he Is to get the best out of life. A person whose life is not happy, who does not enjoy life has made a failure. Wealth does not bring happiness — going after it may, but the possession of it does not make for happi - ness. We are not happy unless we have intellectual outlook and satisfactions. "In making a successful life some of the emotional reactions which tend toward happiness are to have money, to be comfortable, to b'e able to help charities, to raise a family, to be able to travel In old age and be able to see the great treasures of the earth. "If you can't have the emotional experiences first hand then you can get a full life through books. I can make a friend of Lloyd. George, I can sit down and listen while he talks to me. I can take a trip to the south pole with Byrd. Through reading you can make your life full, you can make it more enjoyable and more successful. The question then arises, What shall' you read?" He quoted Robert Mclntyre as having said, "Not 90 per cent of the books written are worth reading." The impossibility of reading everything, all the new books for instance, was expressed by Mr. Scott as follows: "If you were to start when you were ten years old, reading fifteen hours a day until you were eighty-five years old you could not complete one division of the Paris library." So in your reading you need a. guide. "Read for enjoyment," urged Mr. Scott, "not for information or In order to say that you have read a certain book. Be honest with yourself, don't read as duty, find something you like and then read fbr the pure enjoyment of it. "Going into the realm of books Is an adventure in which one needs a guide," he stated; and as a guide he gave the following lists with this advice:. "The books listed below are well worth reading. For more complete reading lists as well as for excellent advice con - cerning reading in general see 'Rewards of Reading' by Frank L.

            <seg id="p417">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION PART II MOTHERS VACATION CAMP Nebraska's first Mothers Vacation Camp was held in Scotts Bluff county June 16 to 19, 1925. The women who attended had such an interesting time that two other counties arranged to have camps later in the summer. These were held at Oakwood Lodge near Crete, and at Arlington. Women seemed to enjoy the camps so thoroughly it was decided to have the state workers help and to hold district' camps. These could be attended by women from several counties so in 1926 six such camps were held as the following table shows: 1925 Camp Place Date Scotts Bluff Co.- Boy Scout Camp June 16-19 Flllmore Co Oakwood Lodge A.ug. 11-14 Washington Co Arlington Aug. 18-20 1926 Deweese : Hastings Klwanls Camp June 6-9 Tecumseh .County Fair Grounds June 14-17 Arlington -X3ounty Fair Grounds June 22-25 New Helena Victoria Springs Aug. 4-7 Curtis Agricultural School Aug. 10-13 Fillmore Co Oakwood Lodge— Aug. 17-20 1927 Seward ; Seward Park June 14-17 Tecumseh County Fair Grounds June 21-24 Deweese Hastings Kiwanls Camp !

            <seg id="p418">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Plans are made in February and March about how many and where and when the camps are to be held during the following sum - mer. The state specialists and the county home demonstration agents tell the women about the camps at the time of their monthly training meetings and on the Achievement ■ Days. Enrollment blanks are fur - nished which- read as follows: ENROLLMENT BLANK I expect to attend the Mothers Vacation Camp which will be held at the Kiwahis Camp Grounds at Deweese from supper time on Tues - day, July 29th to Friday afternoon, August 1st. Enclosed is my enrollment fee of 50 cents. I will pay my regis - tration fee of $3.75 when I arrive at the camp. Name ■ Name of Club Address Telephone County Notice Have this enrollment returned early to your county extension agent so there will be a cot reserved for you. Plan to arrive at the camp by 4:30 if possible so you may be registered and ready for the getting acquainted games at 5 o'clock. If your county does not have a county agent, send your enrollment directly to Mary-Ellen Brown, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebr. After your enrollment is received the county agent will tell you about the program and what to bring to camp. Women were also given a circular which told them "What to Bring to Camp." Following is a copy of the circular: AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION MOTHERS VACATION CAMPS What to Bring to Camp For the Lexington and Deweese camps bring plenty of warm soft bedding (two or three times as much as you think you will need for blankets help to make the cots more comfortable and take the place of a mattress). Also bring a pillow if you desire to have one. It is well to bring four old newspapers to put under the bedding if It is cold. It adds to the looks of the camp if each will have an extra white sheet to spread over her cot. Bring a plate, cup and saucer, knife, fork, spoon, tumbler, and a bowl for cereal. Also bring a tray large enough to carry all of the dishes. You will need at least two dish towels. </seg>
            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Besides bringing the registration fee, bring six eggs auu m*. potatoes. Frequently the campers have donated fresh vegetables or spreads for these help to improve meals. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes and comfortable clothing. Have enough to keep you warm if it is cold or cool If it is hot. You will need your own personal toilet articles Including a wash basin, soap and towels. At Camp Brewster we pay more but every - thing except your toilet articles is furnished. We have found that it is convenient to have rubbers and an um - brella for it frequently rains in a camp and we have to go from one building to another. This year we are to add some handcraft work. All of the supplies will be provided at the camp. The total cost for each will be 80 cents. The handcraft work will be new this year and we believe it will be found interesting and that you will have a product which you will enjoy having in your home later. You will select your material and pay for it the first night of the camp. You may want to have a notebook and pencil. Many campers bring kodaks. The camp program this year is to be a good one and to receive the most benefit from it, you will need to bring a good quantity of determination to have a good time and to help everyone else to do the same'. One of the most important assets for a successful camp is to have each bring a good spirit of sportsmanship and fellowship. It is the custom in Mothers Vacation Camps to assign the campers to various groups, thus those who come from the same community become acquainted With women from other places so in packing your belongings plan to have yours in such shape that you can take any cot to which you will be assigned the first day. ' We will sleep and eat in buildings.. Cots are furnished by the Agricultural Extension Service except at Camp Brewster. There the camp furnishes everything. A cook and her assistants will prepare the food. Each camper will furnish her own dishes and wash them except at Camp Brewster. Plan to arrive in camp by 4:30 on the opening day and stay throughout the camp. Visitors will be very welcome on Friday and may come as early as possible for there win be good talks in the forenoon and one talk early in the. afternoon. No children are to be in the camp until the last day. Visitors on Friday should bring their own picnic lunch. Camp Brewster campers be sure to bring a doctor's certificate so you can enjoy the swimming pool. </seg>
            <seg id="p420">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Each year the same type of programs are planned and the same talent used for the camps as far as possible, then the following year the program and the talent are usually changed. The following publicity was sent to the papers previous to the 1930 Lexington camp: "Nebraska farm women will rest and play in three Mothers Vacation Camps this summer, according to a schedule worked out by Miss Mary-Ellen Brown, state leader of home economics extension work. Complete arrangements have been made for the first camp at Lexington, June 10 to 13. The second camp will be held at Deweese, Clay county, beginning July 29. The third camp will be at Camp Brewster near Omaha beginning August 12. "Local arrangements for the camp at Lexington will be left to Miss Dorothy Norris, assistant county extension agent at Dawson county. The mothers will use the conference grounds near Lexington, bring their own bedding and have the cots and meals furnished at nominal charge to cover the actual cost. "Miss Brown has arranged for music and stunt contests under the direction of Mrs. N. W. Gaines of Lincoln, and some handicraft work with crayons with which the women will make wall hangings and sofa pillows. "Bayard H. Payne of Grand Island is scheduled as the Friday afternoon speaker. Families of the mothers will be invited to the Friday program. Mrs. Anna Dee Weaver, now of the Nebraska Farmer, who has been Mrs. True Homemaker of the University radio program for the past year, will be at the camp to discuss pictures with the women. "The Chamber of Commerce of Lexington are arranging for some local entertainment including a tour to one or two of the business concerns of the city." The same general plan for these camps was used as those of previous years. The first afternoon was spent in getting acquainted, then after supper Mrs. Gaines showed pictures on good posture and led the vesper services. The programs for the other days consisted of visiting, round table discussions, singing and a singing contest, stunt night, hand craft work and interesting talks by good speakers. Two new features of the 1930 camps were the book reviews which was given by Mrs. Julia Kiene and the making of the crayonex wall hangings. At Lexington and Deweese fun night consisted of stunts Based upon Mother Goose rhymes. One is always surprised at the marvelous costumes and the clever acting which appear during the evening. The Deweese program which follows is typical of the others. </seg>

            <seg id="p422">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE at some of the camps the women were asked to write answers to the following questions: 1. How many miles did you drive when you came to the camp? 2. Who is taking care of the home while you are away? 3. What did you have to do to get ready to come to camp? 4. What influenced you to come to camp? The following replies were among the answers to the questions: "Came 67 miles. Left daughter at home. County agent and my family. Came through lots of mud but it was worth all the trouble many times." Left to riaht—Mrs. Julia Klenc Topeka. Kan«: Miss Lillian Brehm. County Home Extension Agent, Hebron ; Mrs. N. \V. Galnes. Lincoln ; Miss Edith Moss, County Home Extension Agent, Red Cloud; Miss Mary Runnalls. County Home Extension Agent, Geneva. "Came about 52 miles. The county agent went out to see me but I was not home so he talked to my husband. My husband said he would do the field work so my older boy could stay in and do the house work and watch the little fellow." "Came 10% miles. Left husband and two children, 8 and 11, to batch. Baked bread, pies, cake, made noodles and churned. Came because I enjoyed last year's camp and gained so much knowledge from it. My husband wanted me to come. I know I go home a more Interesting person with whom to live." </seg>
            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "Came about 30 miles. Came five miles in the mud and bad a terrible time. My daughter took care of things. Our project leader induced me to come. I have had the time of my life and plan on coming back next year." "Came 14 miles. My sister and husband are taking care of the children. My husband made arrangements for my coming, which was a complete surprise to me, the evening before I came here." "Came 60 miles or over. Left my husband and boy home to &lt;lo the work. Have over 600 chickens and a lot of milking and field work to do. Bid not think I could come but my husband thought I should." "I came 23 miles and it rained all the way. Roads were bad to the highway. I cleaned the house, washed, ironed and baked. Have no children so that was not. a worry. My club paid my way and expect me to bring back a lot of good things to them, although I had planned on coming anyway. I have had such a lovely time in every way that I feel sorry for any that could not be here or who were not here because they were too timid to make the first start." "We came 65 miles through mud, but the men were good and brought us and are coming after us. I came because I was here last year and had such a good time." "Three ladies from our club were here last year and had such a good time that I thought I would try it this time. I have enjoyed myself so much that I think I will be back next year." "Came 150 miles. Children were left with a sister. Baked cook - ies, bread, cake and churned. Washed, ironed and scrubbed. I attend - ed camp at Krueger's Lake last year. I enjoyed it so much that is why I am here." "I came about 50 miles. I left my two children with my husband but his sister kept them part of the time when he was away. I had been needing a rest and read about camps in the Nebraska Farmer and decided it was about what I wanted. My husband wanted me to go .as he had just had a trip and I had looked after his business for him." "We went to the Sidney camp last year and as no camp was held there this year we had to come to Lexington. Two car loads came as far as North Flatte. Finding the road almost impassable we left our cars in the garage and took the train. Getting to Lexington late and not being able to get the county agent or Miss Norris, we left our baggage and three of the girls at the depot. The other three started to walk to camp. It was dark and raining but we were un - daunted. Next year Deuel county is voting for another camp at Krueger's Lake. I came 190 miles and left three hired men and my husband. We were in the midst of sheep shearing." </seg>
            <seg id="p424">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "We came from the northeast corner of Buffalo county, a distance of 75 miles. We all have small children. One of us distributed her three, the other two are with their daddies. Our families wanted us to come. We drove our own car and in. the rain all the way. We worked for a week in preparation." ■ "It paid me more than I can express to attend camp. The rest away from the cares of the hqme amidst new scenery, mingling with new people has broadened my outlook and has been of value educa - tionally as well as recreationally." "Complete rest from work, children's troubles, your own worries aud the chance to learn, besides meeting so many nice women." Prize Winning Crayonex Wall Hangings "I found out how well the family of six could get on without me. T was refreshed mentally by exchanging ideas outside of home and because I made new friends and then I was glad to be home again." "I enjoyed • the camp mainly because of the associations. The chance to talk with other women and know what other women are doing." "I felt it paid me in more than one way. First, it was a change from the ordinary; second, it was nice to meet new people and know no matter where .1 go I find someone I know from Camp Brewster." </seg>
            <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "Yes, indeed, it paid me. I felt it a privilege to be one of a group of alert and fun loving mothers 'who so entered into the spirit of doing the things we never find time to do at home." "It is the only vacation some of us have. I enjoyed exchanging ideas as to work, etc., and the general uplift from our daily life." "I should say so, meeting with so many lovely women and the easy, restful program." "I felt rested and got a different idea of club work. It made me see the world from another side of life about many things." "It takes one away from' the cares of home and gives us a good place to talk and enjoy the company of other women." Eating Lunch Under the Trees, at Deweese "It gave me a change and the family learns the responsibility a mother has and appreciates her more." "Enjoyed meeting other women and I have stored up enough happy memories to last all through the year." "Gave me a much needed physical rest and an inspiration to try to be a better mother than ever before." "The vacation camp made me feel that I was more than a com - mon drudge. It sort of lifted me out of the ruts. The different people I met made such an impression on me." </seg>
            <seg id="p426">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "I realize more than before what the College of Agriculture and Extension Service mean to us." "Very much so. It -was a good rest from the routine work at home and I brought home new ideas to my family and friends." "I am more interested in some of the vital questions of the day and can see that women should study these questions more and use their right to vote. I enjoyed every minute of the camp so that it is hard to say Just what part I enjoyed most. But think I learned most from the talks and discussions. Take the school question. I have never gone to school meetings. I haven't been interested much until the last year. I haven't any youngsters to go to school so why bother. Rather a lazy excuse, isn't it, and there's far too many with the same excuse, 'not interested.'" "Our discussion period made me more interested in our own community activities at present and gave me new things to think about." "I surely think it paid me to attend the camp. My worries of home life were completely forgotten the four days because we were kept so busy." "It paid me in every way to attend camp. It was a glorious four dayB. I feel like a different woman. Let the good work go on." </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION PART III 4-H CLUB WORK In order to stimulate greater interest in 4-H home economics judging the Home Economics Section this year again gave $100.00 to apply toward expenses for trips to the National Club Congress held in Chicago each year. These trips are awarded to winners of the judging contest held at the Nebraska State Fair. The winners enter the National judging contests held in Chicago. The Home Economics Section believes these judging contests to be a phase of 4-H work which helps girls to recog - nize and establish standards, to weigh values and to develop judg - ment. The name of the winners of these trips are printed below with letters expressing the appreciation of the girls and stories of their trips which help one to realize the meaning and value of such experi - ences to a 4-H Club girl. Clothing judge — Dorothy Nuetzman. Canning judge — Jessie Markwad. Baked Foods judge — Beulah- Ward. Girls' Room judge — Helen Cole. Weeping Water, Nebr., Dec. 1, 1930. Dear Miss Wilkens: I wish to thank you, who represents the State Home Economics Association, for the trip to Chicago from which I have just returned and which was given me by that Association. I wish I could express to -you, the donor of my trip, the educa - tion and enjoyment I had those five days and my gratitude for it. At any time that I have the opportunity to pass on to someone else anything that I have brought home from this trip, I shall be happy to do so. Gratefully yours, HELEN COLE. The fifty-five Nebraska trip winners gathered at Omaha, November 29 to start for Chicago. There we held a "get-acquainted" banquet at the Rome Hotel. At this banquet Mr. Diers, author of the song "My Nebraska" taught us this and other songs which we certainly made use of the following week. Here we met our temporary "Mother and Dad" who certainly proved real parents the following week. We left that evening at 7:40 on a Northwestern fast mall train and arrived in Chicago the next morning at 7:45. We traveled this whole night through snow and sleet and the weather man, at least, gave us a cold reception In Chicago. </seg>
            <seg id="p428">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE After eating breakfast in the depot we lined up in the formation' which we always used when walking In a group — four abreast two rows of girls in the middle and a row of boys on both sides — thus each girl having an escort. I might add here for the benefit of the girls going in the future, that a sure way of being popular with your escort is to have a very small suit case. This Sunday morning we attended the Central Church of Chicago in Orchestra Hall. After lunch we went out Michigan Boulevard, which borders on the lake, to Fields Museum. This drive was one of the most beautiful things I saw when in Chicago. The lake was covered with mist and in the distance we could see the vague forms of ships and the ice - covered landings that looked like ice cakes, it was a beautiful picture, all in shades of gray. Another impressive view I remember from this Sunday afternoon is the Chicago skyline viewed from the steps of the museum. We could not even get a glimpse of everything in the museum in a half day but we tried to see and get a vague appreciation of the most outstanding collections. . Monday morning we joined the group of fifteen hundred 4-H winners from all over the United States and the well planned program for this week began. The ease and accuracy with which this program for fifteen hundred was carried out was very remarkable. This day was the International Live Stock Show Day. All of the Club judging teams judged this morning. Monday evening we were entertained to a banquet by Thomas E. Wilson, Chairman, National Committee on Boys' and Girls' Club Work. In the Wilson Auditorium there was a continuous movie with special vaudeville acts which was open to us. Later in the evening we were . addressed by President Hoover from Washington. Other unusual numbers on' this evening's program were an address by Mr. Wilson and some selections 'sung by Cyrena Van Gordon, Grand Opera Prima Donna. At 9:00 o'clock Monday night there was a parade of the entire club delegation in the arena of the International Live Stock Exposi - tion. I, as one of the winners, was privileged to ride In the large wagon, drawn by the famous eight-horse team of the Union Stock Yards, which led the parade. Tuesday morning the girls were taken through the Adler Plane - tarium. The demonstration we saw of the stars and planets In their orbets was one of the most beautiful and educational things I have ever witnessed. Later in the morning we went to the Art Institute. There we were given an explanation of some of the most remarkable pictures and collections so that we could make the most of our limited time. </seg>
            <seg id="p429">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION We then were shown through the Chicago Mail Order Company and given luncheon and a program there. After lunch we went through the tropical gardens and the zoo. Tuesday evening the entire delega - tion assembled in the Grand Ballroom of the Sherman Hotel for the ii Club member's Own Banquet and Rally. Half of the fun of these banquets was the cheering and singing, each state trying to drown out his neighbor. All Wednesday morning was spent in going through the Inter - national Harvester Company. This is a huge and interesting concern. We also have a rather personal interest here as Mr. McCormlck and the rest of the company are firm supporters of all 4-H Clubs. We were served luncheon by this company. The remainder of Wednesday afternoon was spent at the Horse Show. This night we attended the National 4-H Play and Recreation I Party at the Ballroom at Hotel LaSalle. The morning of Thursday, the Grand Finale Day, the girls were entertained to breakfast by Montgomery Ward and Company and shown through their vast works. At 10:30 the last morning we took special trains to Mundelein, Illinois, to see the Model Electric Farm there. We were served lunch on the train. This trip gave us an opportunity to see a little of the surrounding country. Thursday afternoon was left free and "Mamma Douglas" did her best to see that each girl, if possible, could do what she pleased this last afternoon. Shopping and theater parties seemed most popular. The last big effort for our. pleasure was an elaborate banquet given us in. the LaSalle Ballroom by the railroads. Our Nebraska group left before this program was over and started for home that night. Our hilarity lasted until the very last when the last group got off the train at Lincoln. I wish I could express in this chronological account of my trip just half of the education and enjoyment we had during these short five days. The greatest feeling of satisfaction I get from my victory — plac - ing high as Girls' Room judge — is the thought that I have shown that I put forth my best for my state and county, who made this trip possible for me.

            <seg id="p430">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE My Trip to Club Congress We met at the Burlington depot at 1:15 o'clock Saturday after - noon and I think everyone was there that was supposed to be be - cause if they were as anxious to go as I was they wouldn't want to be left. We left Lincoln on the 2:00 o'clock flyer for Omaha where we were to meet the rest of the delegation. We waited at the Rome Hotel until everyone had arrived. Afterwards we went to dinner. Mr. Diers, the composer of "My Nebraska," taught us songs which we were to sing during the week. We also had group pictures taken. About 8:00 o'clock we left for Chicago on a special train. Be - fore we went to bed Mr. Frisbie gave us some helpful information concerning our trip. Miss Douglass was the leader of the girls and we surely enjoyed being with her during the trip. It was the first time that most of us had ever slept on a train, and I don't think many of us slept that night. Miss Douglass got us up about 6:00 o'clock in the morning so we would be ready to eat breakfast when we arrived in Chicago. While waiting the conductor explained the safety system of the train in which we were riding. When we arrived in Chicago it was snowing and I guess it had been snowing all night. Upon arriving at the depot we were met at the door by the photographer who took our picture. After breakfast we went to the LaSalle Hotel to register but were unable to get our rooms right away so we went to the Central Church on Michigan Avenue. In the afternoon we visited the Field Museum. It was founded by Marshall Field in 1893 and is located on Roosevelt Road and Lake Michigan. The exterior is of Georgian White marble and based on Greek architecture. It is 440 feet wide, 700 feet long and 104 feet high and is a very beautiful building. We first entered the large central hall of natural history which is 299 feet long, 68 feet wide and 75 feet high. It contains exhibits selected from the departments of anthropogy, geology and zoology. In the evening the club members were guests of the First Episco - pal Church in the Chicago Temple. But the boys and girls who were judges had to stay home and go to bed. Monday morning they divided the groups into two battalions and we marched down the street to the elevated trains which we took to go to the International Exposition. The judging contests started about 9:00 o'clock. All the contests were held in one room. After the contests we got acquainted with girls from the different states. We found the southern girls very interesting and I guess they found us just as interesting. In the afternoon we went around and viewed the different ex - hibits. About 4:30 we were taken by buses to the Wilson Company </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION where we had dinner. President Hoover, Honorary Chairman of the Boys' and Girls' Club Work, gave us an address, which was appre - ciated by everyone. The winners of the different judging contests were announced also. Tuesday morning we were taken in buses to the Adler Plane - tarium, which is a remarkable place. Special demonstration was given by Miss Bennett. Then we were taken to the Chicago Art Institute where we visited the Gothic and Dutch Friesian rooms. We saw the many great works of art, as well as the 1618 piece gold and silver dinner set which was the wedding gift ot Napoleon to his sister. In the afternoon we were visitors of the Chicago Mail Order Com - pany. We were taken through the plant and it is very interesting to know how they fill the orders they send out. After the trip through the plant we were served a delicious dinner and we received desk sets as favors. From the Chicago Mail Order Company we walked to the Lincoln Park. I think nearly all the girls felt good for we drew a lot of attention by our- singing and yelling. Every girl surely boasted for her own state. There were many features of the Lincoln Park but the Tropical Gardens seemed to be the main attraction. It made us feel as though we were' in sunny California. The Nebraska girls boarded a rubber neck bus for home which we thought was a lot of fun. It was very pretty around the lake drives and we enjoyed the ride very much. In the evening the 4-H Club boys and girls had their own club banquet, which was held at the Sherman Hotel. There were about fifteen hundred boys and girls all together. The winners of the Style Show and Health contests was announced. The program was excep - tionally good and was enjoyed by all. Wednesday morning both battalions were taken to the plant of the International Harvester Company. We went through the factory where they made tractors, we found it very noisy and dangerous but they practice safety first very strongly. After dinner we were taken through the twine factory.

In the evening we had our final banquet in the ball room of the LaSalle Hotel as guests of the railroads. The Nebraska group had to leave before the banquet was over so as to catch our train for home. We were very tired and went to bed as soon as we got on the train.

We arrived in Lincoln about noon, and. it surely seemed good to go down the streets and see clean buildings and enjoy sunlight. I surely enjoyed my trip to Chicago, and I want to thank all who made it possible for me to take it. BEULAH WARD ***** 4834 Adams Street, Lincoln, Nebr., Dec. 8, 1930. Dear Miss Wllkens; I was very much pleased when I found that I should write this letter to you. It gives me an opportunity to thank you not only for the trip but also for your help this summer which made it possible for me to win this trip. I know you would have enjoyed going through the club building and seeing the exhibits. They gave me so many ideas that I can use in my own club work. When I was in the club building there were many photographers taking pictures of the exhibits. I saw them tak - ing the picture of the girl from Georgia who won first with her com - plete costume. You said that you would like to hear about our judging contest. In the class of complete costumes there was only one "complete" cos - tume. In the other three something was lacking. There were two suits, one three-piece ensemble and one one-piece dress. With the costume that placed first there was some of the nicest underwear that I have ever seen in such a contest. I was quite pleased with the class of dresses for a stout girl. There was a cool-colored print, a warm-colored print of not quite so recent style, a pique with a complicated design and a dress of suiting with polka dots in the waist and a contrasting line, around the center. The judge said that the class "of slips was quite unique because there was something wrong with all of them, and I quite agree with her. There were two with built up shoulders, one quite wide, and two with straps. The bottom one looked as if It were as wide as it was long. </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The class of bloomers was quite ordinary, but instead of placing a pongee bloomer with fitted yoke first as was my idea, they placed it third, because they said some states would object to placing a pongee bloomer over cotton. If you have any questions about the contest, I shall be glad to answer them. Yours truly, DOROTHY NUETZMAN. My Trip What a fine time I had in Chicago! It really began when I be - came acquainted with Miss Douglass, Mr. Lawrence and many of the 4-H boys and girls at the Burlington station in Lincoln. After our ride on the train to Omaha there was many more people to meet and know as friends. At the dinner at the Rome Hotel, we were told we must mind "Mamma" Douglass and "Papa" Claybaugh. It took about two hours or more that night to get everything ready so that we could climb into our berths; and some of us really did climb into the uppers. For some of the members on the trip it was the first experience on a Pullman. The rocking of the train kept some awake, and the stopping at towns woke others, so that few could say that they had a good night's sleep. After breakfast at the Northwestern Station we went to the La- Salle Hotel to register and get our rooms. We were all eager to see what our hotel rooms would be like. We found that we could not have them until that evening. However we went to church, had lunch, and visited the. Field Museum. At the Museum I found so many things of interest that I could not begin to look at them carefully or tell mucji about them after - . wards. I can recall best the hideous masks that the Chinese people used to wear. Some of them were in the form of a beast's head and others were just men's faces, but all of them were terrible to look at. I enjoyed looking at the textile work of many of the primitive peoples. The building itself is a beautiful thing. Stanley Field Hall is the main one from which other halls on two floors open. I believe that there must be at least a hundred of the smaller halls. On Monday we went out to the International grounds where some of the group had their judging contest and the rest looked around. Many of the states had exhibits there. One that I remember best was a sweet potato exhibit from Tennessee. About 4:00 o'clock we went to the Wilson Company's auditorium where we saw and heard a program of talkies and skits. After each state had eaten dinner they assembled again in the auditorium to listen to President Hoover's speech. As they were leaving to go back to the hotels that night, several of the states gave their yells and songs. </seg>
            <seg id="p434">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The girls and boys went in different groups on Tuesday. The girls enjoyed visits to the Alder Planetarium and the Art Institute. I had never expected to see so wonderful a spectacle as that at the Planetarium where some of the happenings in the sky were told and shown to us. In the Art Institute I was pleased to find the original of one of my favorite pictures, "The Song of the Lark." We were entertained at Lunch by the Chicago Mail Order Com - pany and in the afternoon we went to Lincoln Park. We were for - tunate to be there at 4:00 o'clock when the animals were fed. We took a rubberneck bus back to the hotel where we rested until time for the Club Banquet at the Sherman Hotel. The Style Revue was given at this banquet. As guests of the International Harvester Company we visited their plant on Wednesday and had lunch with them. Mr. Cyrus McCormlck made the announcement about the scholarships for which every club member hopes to qualify. At the grounds of the International Live Stock Show we saw the Horse Show. A chariot race by a small ' boy and a small girl and their ponies was an interesting feature. At the 4-H party that evening we learned several songs, some of them with motions.' It was quite fun to get mixed on the motions. I know, because that is just what I did. Thursday morning the girls enjoyed a breakfast as guests of Montgomery Ward and Company, followed by a trip through the plant. After a fifty mile ride out into the country we saw the Model Electric Farm. This trip took us quite a while so that when we returned to the hotel there was time for only, one activity before we were expected at the banquet at the LaSalle. Should we go to a theater or shop? The question was settled by letting each one go in whichever group she chose. Before the program was finished at the banquet, the Nebraska delegates had started on the homeward trip. Some of the girls were determined to see the Mississippi River, but they had a difficult time in staying awake to do it. Just before we reached Omaha we were entertained by speeches from several members of the party. Good luck and a big time to all the delegates next year. DOROTHY NUETZMAN. McCook, Nebr., December 13, 1930. Dear Miss Wilkens: I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to you for my trip which you made possible. I enjoyed it very much and will probably never have another chance like it. It was not only a pleasure but very educational. Again thanking you, I remain, yours sincerely, JESSIE MARKWAD. </seg>
            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION I attended the 4-H Club Congress at Chicago this year. I left McCook at 7:10 Saturday morning, November 29. We went through Lincoln about 1:35 P. M. and there several other Nebraska delegates boarded the train for Omaha. We arrived in Omaha at 3:25 P. M. and were then taken to the Rome Hotel where we rested until 6:00 o'clock and then went to dinner. By this time most of the Nebraska delegation had arrived and we were led in Nebraska songs by Mr. Diers, author of "My Nebraska". At 7:40 P. M. we left Omaha on the Northwestern fast mall train for Chicago. Mr. Frisbie gave us important instructions, we sang songs, and got acquainted until 11:00 o'clock when we went to our berths. We arrived in Chicago about 7:46 A. M. Sunday and ate break - fast at the depot, from there we went to the LaSalle Hotel where we registered for the week. After registering we attended the morn - ing services at the Central Church of Chicago. In the afternoon we spent most of our time at the Field Museum. This was quite a treat to most of us. From the Museum you could see Lake Michigan which was the biggest treat of any for me. In the evening all except those who were to judge on Monday attended church at the Methodist Church and there heard the Nebraska quartette. Those not going to church stayed at the hotel and retired at an early hour. Monday morning after breakfast we went to the Live Stock Ex - position grounds and judged from about 10:00 o'clock in the morning until 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon. The rest of the afternoon we had to ourselves to wander about and see the stock and other exhibits. In the evening we were entertained at a banquet and program given by Thomas E. Wilson. The program was very interesting as one of the features was a talk by President Hoover. After the program the en - tire delegation was to parade in the arena of the International Live - stock Exposition at which time the champions were announced. Tuesday morning we visited the Planetarium. There we had a special demonstration by Miss M. Bennett. From there we were taken to the Art Institute and shown through. It was very interesting and beautiful. We' were guests of the Chicago Mall Order Company for luncheon and were also shown through their building. In the after - noon we were taken to- Lincoln Park to view the Tropical Gardens and other things of Interest. At the park we took "rubber-neck" buses for our hotel to prepare for the 4-H banquet in the evening. Wednesday was known as manufacturers' day for we had an educational tour through the International Harvester Plant and were guests of the International Harvester Company for luncheon. After luncheon we attended the Exposition- to see the Matinee Horse Show. The Nebraska group had dinner at the "Triangle" and in the evening we went to the 4-H party which was given on the nineteenth floor of the LaSalle hotel. There Mr. Tom had charge of the entertainment. </seg>

The girls were guests of Montgomery Ward and Company for breakfast • and were taken through the building. We left there for a trip by motor coach and special train to the model farm at Mundelein, Illinois.' We inspected the building there and returned to our special trains where we ate lunch as the guests of the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois. Thursday afternoon the girls went shopping and in the evening the entire delegation were guests of several railroad companies at a banquet given at the LaSalle Hotel. The Nebraska delegation left the banquet early and boarded the train for home. We arrived in Omaha about 10:00 o'clock. I stayed in Omaha with relatives until Saturday morning so did not arrive in McCook until Saturday , evening, Decem - ber 6.

            <seg id="p439">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON Mrs. Henry Bruss, president, opened the Home Economics pro - gram of Western Nebraska Organized Agriculture with the following poem as her address. The poem was composed by Mrs. Bruss for the occasion. "Home is the inn where love is landlord. And "Sweet contentment" the chief guest, Home is the School where Love is teacher, And where all virtues are taught best. Home is what every heart desires, The fondest thing God ever gave. Home is the nearest thing to heaven, For mortal man this side the grave. And today your president greets you, With a homelike greeting true, May the message you receive here Make a real "Home Maker" of you." Mrs. Mildred Day of the Kellogg Co., Battle Creek, Mich., was introduced and gave a demonstration on "Home Dinners for Com - pany." Mrs. Day said: "So many times guests arrive just as the housewife is making preparations for dinner. It has always been a lot of fun at our home to make the food stretch for several more persons. We are always so glad to have our friends drop in that we can always find some way to make the food go further. "Shall we glance at the menu we are going to prepare today? Mock Drum Sticks Baked Stuffed Potatoes Cauliflower with Cheese Sauce Hearts of Lettuce with Tomato Dressing All-Bran Mulllns and Butter Honey Krisp Roll Kaffee Hag Coffee "Suppose that you had planned to have round steak — but since you want something a little different — you decide to make mock drum sticks. These are very attractive. Almost any kind of meat can be used for them. My butcher will make these up for me and I hope your "butcher is as accommodating as mine. Mock Drum Sticks Mock drum sticks are rolled pieces of veal, beef, or pork fastened with a projecting skewer.- They resemble chicken legs.

Dip in beaten eggs to which 1 teaspoon of salt has been added. Roll again in Corn Flakes. Saute quickly. Add M, cup water. Place in a moderate oven (350°F.) for an hour, basting when necessary. Yield: 6 servings. "For the baked stuffed potatoes I use a regular baking potato. It is very convenient to have baking potatoes in the store room. Since they are usually more expensive than potatoes used for boiling I do not use them in any other way. Baked Stuffed Potatoes Scrub potatoes well. Rub lightly with shortening. Bake in moderate oven (400"F.) about one hour. Remove from oven. Cut in half lengthwise. Remove potato with a spoon, being careful not to break shell. Mash potato, season with butter, salt and pepper. Add enough milk to make potatoes fluffy. Beat thoroughly. Fill shells with mixture. Sprinkle tops with paprika. Return to oven and brown. ***** "The extra vegetable today is cauliflower. De we cover the kettle when cauliflower is cooked? No — we don't — because it is one of the strongly flavored vegetables that should be cooked uncovered. Cauliflower with Cheese Sauce 1 medium head of cauliflower 2 cups milk 3 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons flour % cup grated cheese Wash cauliflower. Steam until tender (25 minutes). Melt butter, blend with flour. Add the milk gradually and stir constantly until thickened. Add salt and cheese and continue to stir until cheese is melted. Place head of cauliflower in casserole and pour cheese sauce over it. Keep in a warm oven until ready to serve. • • • • • "The tomato dressing is something quite new and different. If you do not happen to have a clove of garlic — onion will do just as well. Garlic is something that should be used with discretion. It gives a recipe a subtle flavor and makes one wonder just what has been added to the dressing. When you are making other kinds of dressings, just rub the bowl with the cut surface of the clove of garlic. </seg>

But if you will note the recipe for Honey Krisp Roll you will see that It is an ice box pudding. So ot course I made it earlier in the day. This dessert is made of rolled Rice Krispies. No sugar is used. . Honey is nature's own sweet and one that should be included more often in meal planning. We have a number of good recipes for honey which we will be glad to send you if you will write to us. Someone always asks the question: "Can I substitute honey in my recipes which call for sugar?" and I always say that it is possible but there are so many good recipes which call for either honey or sugar that it is not practical unless one is accus - tomed to making substitutions.

When ready to serve, slice with a sharp knife, top with whipped cream sweetened with honey and garnish with a fresh or preserved straw - berry or cherry. "Muffins should not be baked until the last minute because we want them to be served piping hot. They can be stirred up earlier in the day if you wish, covered with waxed paper and placed in a very cold place and then baked just before dinner. </seg>

So stir only until the flour disappears. Roll small pieces of apple in cinnamon and sugar and place one on each muffin before baking. Now it won't be necessary to have jam or jelly at this dinner because we will have muffins and jam all in one. "If you are having the dinner in the evening I am sure your family and guests would appreciate it if you would serve a caffeine - free coffee, Kaffee Hag Coffee. No one will need to refuse Kaffee Hag as it will not keep them awake because the stimulating element — caffeine — has been removed from this coffee. At your evening parties when lunch is served late I am sure the guests would consider you a very thoughtful hostess if you served Kaffee Hag Coffee. Of course the children present at the dinner table will all drink milk." Dr. C. M. Pierce of Chadron was next introduced and spoke as follows: HEAIiTH AN ASSET "To a group that has watched the development In the improve - ment of the herd of cattle, sheep, hogs, etc., it does not seem necessary to talk health other than to direct your thoughts along this line. The subject this afternoon is 'Health an Asset,' and I think perhaps this can best be shown by the use of a balance sheet. We consider health as an asset on the balance sheet; and sickness as a liability. I think no one will question this The assets are: 1. Ability to work. 2. Ability to support a family and save for later years. 3. Ability to make others happy. 4. Ability to play. </seg>
            <seg id="p443">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Following are the liabilities: Suffering of Individual, Family, and Friends. Expense of Doctor, Medicine,, Nurse, Hospital. Loss of income and Loss of pleasure. "How can we control the balance between liabilities and assets — between sickness and health? The first thing we must think of is eugenics, which you are all practicing with handling of cattle on the farm. 1. Eugenics. 2. Pre-natal care ".!. Obstetrical care 4. Nursing care. 5. Childhood supervision. 6. Adolescence supervision. 7. Care of adult. "The greatest points of control are eugenics, proper food, cloth - ing, surroundings. Immunization against diseases and the annual physi - cal examination. I think the things that will perhaps ultimately benefit us the most can be named under three heads. 1. Eugenics. 2." Proper care of the child. 3. Medical supervision consisting of examination and immunization. "The old idea of the inability to control the mating of Individuals does not hold today, when one considers that love affairs should be foreseen by parents before they become a problem of control. Go back to the handling of your cattle. The thing you do is to see that the male is healthy, well developed and from proper forefathers. The same on the female side. Is it any less important to see that your daughter or sons associate with those who are in like standing? This is the time that such mating can be controlled. It is not the time to bring up the question of mating after association has been allowed a considerable length of time. We are not going too far when we suggest that a boy or girl who considers marriage should have a physical examination to determine their health and ability to produce offspring which will be an asset to themselves and the community. "I think the time will come when birth control will be taught so that we will limit the offspring to those who will be an asset rather than a liability. We have, at the present time, just such a problem to face in a girl and boy who are not fit to carry on their duties of life and yet I see no reason why we should interfere with their future happiness, except that they should not be allowed to reproduce chil - dren. So we have the supervision before the problem of reproduction is decided .and then the pre-natal care. </seg>
            <seg id="p444">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "With supervision during pregnancy accidents at childbirth can be prevented almost without exception. Often one expects trouble that does not occur but certainly we can prevent and limit some of the troubles that do occur. The question of expense comes up with many families. It is the practice in this community to make no charge for the care of the .expectant mother. You possibly know that the usual charge for obstetrical care here is $35.00. Doctors are advising monthly examinations before delivery and two calls after delivery which means, if we were to take the same time with other patients, it would amount to nine office calls at $2.00 or $18.00, two post partum calls at $3.00 or $6.00, and the nurse $5.00 or a total of $29.00, leaving $6.00 for delivery as compared to $24.00 net with no pre-natal care. There can be no suspicion of a financial reason on our part for advising the expectant mother to be under proper care during the nine months of pregnancy and very often we are able to detect trouble that is coming and control it so that no additional cost Is Incurred by the patient at time of delivery. "In regard to care during confinement, I feel safe in saying that when hospitillzation is organized to the extent that it is within the reach of everyone care of such patients in the . hospitals will be in - creased by a large percentage. It Is almost impossible to do what we consider sterile work in a home. In the hospital the patient is under the constant observation of a properly trained, nurse, the child is under the care of a nurse and is started off on regular intervals of feeding. There can be no objection except the cost and contact with many patients which some families do not like. The cost with the same quality of service is even now much less than in the home. "Proper feeding of the child; I think any of you during this time of Thanksgiving and Christmas remember a great many times when it seems advisable for you to eat heavy meals, frequently you overeat, eat irregularly and know the suffering that follows. You should take into consideration that a baby knows nothing of suffering except that when he has distress in the stomach it means hunger. He is willing to over fill that stomach and overeat though distressed. It is im - portant that the regular four-hour interval feeding should be begun at once after birth unless the child needs more frequent feeding, non - scheduled feedings reverts back to our early childhood when mothers nursed their babies whenever necessary. Time was available and today when the mothers who work as hard as our grandmothers did, do not have time to nurse their , babies every two or three hours. Today with our different system of living the baby receives closer attention and it is not uncommon to hear a mother complain of a fussy baby that becomes happy and healthy when put on a four-hour feeding and no other care is necessary. "A little later in the life of the child one of the most important things that can be done in pre-school age is a complete physical examination to anticipate trouble that may arise. In the first place </seg>
            <seg id="p445">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION the teeth — we do not stop to consider that early in life teeth decay long before we thing about preserving permanent teeth, the jaws broaden out, making room for permanent teeth and if the child's teeth are not watched and given proper care it means crooked teeth, a cause of later tooth trouble; and tooth trouble early in life is a frequent forerunner of stomach trouble, rheumatism and other dis - eases. The teeth, tonsils, under developed chest, kidney troubles which often develop in these early days are often the cause of heart trouble, rheumatism, etc., and the time to find these is long before they produce symptoms that the ordinary person can diagnose. Their increase should be retarded before visibility begins. "I wish we could pass on to every mother the innate fear that we have of preventable diseases. By the modern method of vaccina - tion we can prevent many serious diseases. Smallpox is an absolutely preventable disease. There is no evidence to prove that vaccination has not reduced smallpox in any community where it has been used regardless of rash statements of some radicals. When the United States took over the control of the Phlllippines there were around 20,000 cases of smallpox annually. By persistent and thorough vac - cination of the natives that number was cut down to approximately 200. Within a few years some of the religious sects in the Island began to preach against vaccination . for smallpox and as a result the prevalence of the disease came back to where it was twenty to thirty years ago. "During the World War there were something like two hundred cases of typhoid. The living conditions of our soldiers in France and in some hastily erected camps in this country were far less healthy than during previous wars, but if the same incidencer had prevailed there would have been some 60,000 deaths from this disease. "Diphtheria is also preventable. A large percentage of our chil - dren are immune from diphtheria. By immunization the Schick Test can be made negative so that the child in nearly every case can be ■ Immune from diphtheria for life. By this Immunization and by the use of anti-toxin our horror of this disease would disappear. "The tonsils are considered a joke to many people. There are two sides to the question. It is thought by many good men that tonsils and adenoids are put in the throat as a protection against germs getting to other parts of the body and that they should not be removed without a definite understanding of the damage done to the child. But if you could see the damage done to children today by rheumatism there could be no argument against their removal when once decided that they are Infected. Almost without exception defec - tive, hearts can be traced back to rheumatism, and rheumatism most frequently develops when we have infection of tonsils or teeth. "These are the most common defects that we see in children the correction of which tends to increase the health of that child through </seg>
            <seg id="p446">1 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE die remainder of their lives — that is, immunization against contagious diseases and elimination of infection that brings on heart, lungs, ear or kidney troubles. "A little later the stage of adolescence appears. With a great many of the girls so-called female defects become apparent. Our modesty taught to our younger generation prevents many of us from taking care of those defects early in life. But the day of modesty in regard to those things from the standpoint of having advice as to their correction will soon be, if it is not already, passed. The same thing applies to boys. "There is at the present time a movement to encourage the fre - quency of annual physical examination of adults. We are making a practice of calling in business men for an annual check up. It is not unusual at all in those cases to find a man losing from one-fourth to one inch a year in the expansion of his chest, he is losing the vitality of his lungs and at the same time his abdomen is increasing. It is not uncommon to have patients- come in complaining of certain troubles which many times Indicate the beginning of a general breakdown. There is no chance of curing that particular ailment of other ailments that are producing it after a patient waits too long, whereas a few years earlier this might have been kept under control. "The preventative side of medicine today is of most interest and certainly if it could be carried over to the laymen and particularly to the mothers, it should be of great Interest to them as it governs the health of the family and the health of the community. "Begin now by having your children checked up — you will have far greater interest In community welfare if you talk health and fit - ness in your local meetings and keep a record of the development of your children by the school examinations, Immunization against con - tagious disease, consideration of eugenics in sex relations, pre-natal care and supervised feeding of infants." A delightful tea sponsored by the Dawes County Extension Clubs with Mrs. J. L. Brown of Chadron as hostess was enjoyed by the women. Sandwiches, tea, and wafers were served. A quartet com - posed of ladies from the Ladies' Auxiliary of Chadron sang. Mrsv Roy Wagner, Mrs. C. E. Ball, Mrs. Henry Bell, and Mrs. G. A. Bueltner composed the quartet. </seg>

            <seg id="p448">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION THURSDAY FORENOON The Thursday morning session was opened with Mrs. Bruss pre - siding in the absence of the vice-president. Music was furnished by the Glee Club of the Chadron High School. Miss Mary Mason of the Home Economics Department. College of Agriculture, was Introduced and spoke on "Around and About the Kitchen." Miss Mason said: "A survey of your equipment situation for a well furnished kitchen entails wise selection, efficient placement and use, proper care and upkeep and a plan for substitution or replacement when necessary. ' "A wise selection is based on several important factors. The first is a just apportionment of the household budget. If we were to be guided by the hypnotic influence of advertising, we might be led to purchase a $200 cook stove and- then go in debt for the food prepared on It. "There is only a half truth in the commercial slogan: 'It is not so much what you spend as what you get for what you spend that counts." We, as Home Economists are still concerned in a large measure with the amount that we spend along with what we are getting for the expenditure. "We have found that by rigid discipline a fairly satisfactory set of kitchen utensils may be purchased for $25.00. This set Includes only the things that we have judged to be essential for meal prepara - tion for a family of five with the occasional guests or hired help. If this set is purchased by extremely careful buying, at sale price, three or four dollars might be saved, allowing the selection of more satisfactory articles or a few additional utensils that might be de - sirable. "We have continued this study adding to the first set and making substitutions until we have a second set worth $50.00. We are pay - ing an additional $2 5.00 for increased efficiency, durability and gen - eral satisfaction in use. This gives a very complete set of kitchen utensils, though it Includes nothing in electrical equipment and no great variety in pans or bowls. Good Management in Selecting Kitchen Utensils "Points to consider in justifying your selection. In equipping the kitchen with cooking utensils consideration must be given to the fol - lowing points — the amount of equipment needed, the cost and quality of each article, the material or ware and the comparative cost of dif - ferent wares, the durability, the adaptability of the utensil In size, shape, and material to the process for which it is used, the comfort, satisfaction and ease In use, the time and attention required in its use and care, the ease with which it may be stored, and last and possibly of lesser importance, the appearance Of the utensil. </seg>

            <seg id="p450">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE -Avoid overstocking your kitchen. You will agree that an over - stocked kitchen Is a burden and an understocked kitchen a very defi - nite handicap in your kitchen routine. "You may be tempted Into careless habits of procedure by having too many utensils in use for each individual process. This is one of the dangers of an overstocked kitchen. A specific example might be the array of utensils stacked on table and cabinet and in the sink after a cake making process. Have you experimented until you have discovered the minimum set of equipment for this process or do you .use pans, bowls, spoons, cups and sifters sufficient for at least two separate preparations? It takes time to assemble these utensils and time to wash and replace them. It means crowded shelves and drawers and if you are hurried it often means a carelessly arranged cupboard, Fewer available utensils might force you into habits of greater efficiency. "It may be that a misdirected idea of thrift influences you to keep on hand utensils that have long outworn their period of useful - ness, such as the knife with the broken handle, the egg' beater that jumps cogs, the can opener that never has worked, the pan that leaks and so on through the list. It is frequently true that as new utensils are provided the old things are retained for no particular reason ex - cept that the housewife, instinctively opposed to wastefulness in any form, hesitates in throwing them away. Time, energy and patience are saved if broken and worn out utensils are discarded as soon as substitutes are made. The inefficient and unused equipment which is the result of unwise selection may be retained if in good repair, pro - viding there is clinging to it a worthy suggestion of future usefulness. It should, however, be removed from the main storage centers to a top shelf or compactly stored and well labeled in a box in the base - ment or attic. "Some housewives would be surprised to find that their invest - ment in kitchen utensils mounts up to $150 or $200. Such a set may include a flreless cooker, a pressure cooker, combination steamer and waterless cooker, eight or a dozen bowls of different sizes, colors, and wares, baking pans in three or four different wares but used for the same purpose. Sauce pans and kettles enough to furnish a couple of kitchens and other equipment in similar quantities. "Even though the money invested may well be afforded such an overstocked kitchen requires a great deal of time to keep in order and there is a waste of energy in moving quantities of equipment in order to find the one thing that is needed. Bargain Equipment is Sometimes Expensive "A few examples will indicate the truth of the above statement. It may be the purchase of a bargain stew pan of light weight material. It has a capacity of four or five quarts. The purchaser argues that </seg>
            <seg id="p451">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION It holds just as much as another pan- that costs five or six times u much. She may not have considered that the bargain pan has a metal ball with no insulated handle, that this ball may be attached a little off center so that the pan tips when carried, endangering its contents. She may not have noticed that a lid would not fit snugly on this pan or that due to its small base and bulging sides It would be slow to heat and would take up too much room on the kitchen range. She may not have figured on the hard wear the pan was to receive or the comparative length of life of the two pans when sub - jected to this wear. "Another example is the many purpose tool or utensil demon - strated at the county fair or operated so deftly in the show window. Though it may be a purchase amounting to only a dollar or two, it may not meet a definite need. Uses for the utensil are Invested but this may add to the time required for meal preparation which Is a situation we are trying to avoid. Therefore, after a few weeks, the article purchased with such interest falls into disrepute. In addition to the fact that it fails to meet a real need, it may be poorly con - structed and of poor material, thus limiting its period of usefulness. "Due to a. rather recent awakening to the need of labor savers in the home, many novel contrivances are being placed on the market. The housewife should be sure that these articles are real labor savers instead of labor producers, that they will be used enough to make their purchase worth while and that they are constructed so as to be fool proof and to give a reasonable amount of service. Factors of Annoyance Should Be Minimized "Quarreling at your equipment day after day shows poor judg - ment and unsound economy. The coffee pot that topples over every time the lid is open, the pan that will not stand up when empty are examples of purchases made in haste with little thought of satisfac - tion in use. Too often, the housewife waits to purchase the utensil until the need is urgent. She then takes the first thing she finds or the only thing available at the time. She may save time in selection, but she is wasting time and temper in the months to follow in using and caring for an unsatisfactory utensil. "Be sure you know what you want before you buy and do not be satisfied with makeshifts or 'almost as good' articles until you have exhausted all possibilities of getting the thing that best meets your particular need. 'What you get for what you spend,' is of the utmost Importance. The Budget is a Safeguard Against Extravagant Purchases "The formulation of a plan for household expenditure and the apportionment of a fixed sum each year for replacement and upkeep of equipment will be a safeguard against the temptation to buy un- </seg>
            <seg id="p452">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE essential equipment because you want something new or because it looks interesting or because it is cheap and a use might be found for it. It might also prove that it was an extravagance to stock up with a new set of enamel ware just so that the color will harmonize with the newly painted kitchen. : ■ Propaganda and High Pressure (Salesmanship Influence • Many Purchases "Checking up on the latest scientific investigations we find that there is not foundation for the argument that the combination of aluminum with certain foods causes digestive disturbances. This being true you may have no fear in using your aluminum ware and need not give this as a reason for discarding and buying anew. "The health of the family is not necessarily endangered if you are using some other pan than a waterless cooker in which to cook your vegetables and meats. The heavy weight aluminum ware is more durable and is easier to clean. It does not burn so readily and requires less attention in regulating the heat of the burner or the fuel in the stove. It is usually true that the pans are well built with snugly fitting lids, straight sides and flat bottoms. Their speed in heating is due to these last three factors. A light weight aluminum pan with these last three qualifications would very likely heat more rapidly, but would also cool more quickly. "Some of these cookers have an insulated base which of course might be used with the light weight utensil with proportional advan - tage. We have found that the evaporation is no greater from the light weight pan than from the heavy weight pan, providing that the lid fitted with equal closeness in each case. If the false sales arguments as used by some agents were really true in regard to the minerals and vitamins lost in the steam, the light weight pan would be as good as the heavy weight pan in this regard. "Certain green leaf vegetables are supposed to be cooked without ■ j a lid on the kettle. This is done to retain the green color and improve : the flavor. The mineral content is not affected in the least. Any ,• well built sauce pan, a small amount of water and a properly regulated burner will give you good results in this case. "Some of the pans of the heavier wares are too heavy for the housewife to handle easily and she may choose a lighter pan because of this factor. This might be true of the six quart sauce pan or the large tea kettle. "The expense involved in the purchase of a complete set of pans of this heavier ware often lacks justification. Certainly it cannot be justified from the nutritional standpoint and as to the standard of the final product, pans costing half -as much will turn out as good results, if the pans are properly chosen and managed. </seg>
            <seg id="p453">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION More About Pans "Much time is saved in bringing foods to the boiling point it pans are provided with tightly fitted lids. Pans with broad bottoms and straight sides provide more rapid heating of the pan contents than a pan with small base and flaring sides. Pans with buckled bot - toms preventing direct contact with the heating surface are a waste of time and fuel. In selecting small pans be sure that the weight of the handle does not overbalance the pan when it is empty. This is often true of light weight pans. In selecting baking pans keep in mind the size of your oven. Select sizes and shapes of pans that may be fitted together in your oven in preparing an oven meal. Care should be taken to avoid overcrowding of the oven. Proper air cir - culation must be provided around the sides of the oven and between and over the separate pans of food to insure good results in baking. "Sometimes the heat in the oven 1 is baffled, that is. the circula - tion df heat is interfered with by having the pans placed improperly in relation to one another. If the oven is filled to capacity and one pan is placed directly over another, the heat may not circulate to the best advantage for all the products that are to be -baked. When whole meals are to be prepared in the oven, this is rarely true, as they are in the oven for a longer time and the heat is applied to the food in a different way than for pastries, cakes, etc. "Baking powder biscuits are better baked- on cookie sheets as the sides of the pans interfere with, circulation of heat. These sheets, however, often are so large that they obstruct the circulation of the heat In the oven. ' "There is a very substantial argument in favor of the steamer or waterless cooker which has a clamped lid with a steam vent. This particular type of kettle is equipped with a rack and pans to accommo - date three different foods,'" a meat and two vegetables; or a meat, a vegetable and a dessert. It requires very little attention and may take the place of one or two extra .pans. The flat bottomed, straight sided pans that are known as flreless cooker kettles are very satis - factory pans for top burner cookery. The lids clamp tightly in place. The pans are a convenient size and the set of one large five or six quart pan and two smaller four quart pans make an efficient set for the farm kitchen. "The choice of wares whether aluminum or enamel ware Is based largely on personal opinion though we have a few scientific facts that may explain our prejudices. Granite or enamel ware absorbs radiated heat readily, but is a poor conductor of heat. Aluminum Is an excel - lent conductor of heat, but has a tendency to reflect the radiated heat downward again if bright. You may have discovered that your enamel ware heated a little quicker on your kerosene ; stove than did your aluminum ware or that it was slower 'than your aluminum on your </seg>
            <seg id="p454">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE range. The above facts render an explanation for this. Heat Is trans - ferred to the pan from the burner of a kerosene stove largely by - radiation while the heat from the top of the wood range is trans - ferred largely by direct conduction. Tilings Which Might Be Included in Your Equipment Program "The following are a few suggestions of items that might well be included in the list for the housewife who wishes to build up an efficient set of kitchen utensils: "No tool or utensil is used more often than the kitchen knife. Such knives should be substantial and have a good cutting edge. They are not often found at the ten cent store. Blades of stainless steel, bearing the stamp of a reliable manufacturer of cutlery will usually give satisfaction. A very good paring knife is now on the market with stainless crobalt blade and a substantial bakelite handle. The blade will retain its sharp edge longer than will some of the less expensive stainless steel handles. It can be purchased for 75tf. The handles should be riveted firmly so that they will not warp. If a metal shield is attached where the blade fits into the handle, this shield should be soldered to the blade and morticed into the handle, so that it will protect the handle from moisture. ' ' "A cheap can opener is an annoyance. It becomes dull in a short time and makes hard work of what might be a simple process. A can opener which fits into a wall bracket and operates by a crank, with a simple lever, clamping the can and holding it in place during the cutting process, is the most satisfactory on the market. Its increased cost is justified by its ease and simplicity in use. "A convenient knife sharpener may be had consisting of two metal or emery discs through which the knife blade .is passed, draw - ing it down to a fine cutting edge. This sharpener may be attached to the cupboard or work table or is available with a handle attached and may be placed in a drawer when not in use. "A household tool kit may be a very helpful addition to some kitchens. This kit may be fitted into a shallow drawer or better still into a shallow cupboard built into the wall or taken from the end of the built-in kitchen cabinet with the door opening back against the wall. The tools may be held in place by spring brackets attached to the back of the cupboard. . "To make storage simpler and the apprehension of lost tools easier, it is well to paint the outline of the tool against the wall in the position in which the tool is supposed to hang. A glance indicates whether the tools are all in place. This tool kit might consist of a claw hammer, a small, medium and large size screw driver, a small crescent wrench, monkey wrench, a pair of substantial six-inch pliers. </seg>
            <seg id="p455">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION a chisel, tinner's shears, a broad short blade putty knife, oil cans and an assortment of nails, screws, etc. Other tools may be added it the need exists. These tools should be of good quality and should be marked so that they may not become confused with the garage tools. Good Equipment and Efficient Methods Mean More Time and Energy for Other Things. "It has been assumed In the discussion of equipment that the housewife has developed or Is anxious to improve her methods of work in the kitchen routine. There is usually an opportunity for this even though the equipment situation may be either ideal or hopeless. However, with good equipment plus efficient methods the housewife may realize the satisfaction of doing each process well and in the easiest and quickest way possible, thus leaving time for other things." Miss Ethel Delzell of the Chadron Teachers College, in her ad - dress on the "Value of Home Economics Education," said: "This subject: 'The Value of Home Economics Education,' upon which I have been asked to talk may seem a bit intangible at first. We are all acquainted with the meaning of the 'intangible tax' which has become a tangible thing in this state and I trust the value of Home Economics education may be as evident. "In order to intelligently discuss this subject we should, I believe, first decide what we mean by education and then see what contribu - tions Home Economics can offer. "Herbert Spencer says: 'The function of education is to prepare us for complete living and we judge the value of any training, solely by reference to this end.' His idea of complete living, 'in which we must know in what way to treat the mind, in what way to manage our affairs, in what way to behave as a citizen, in what way to utilize those sources of happiness which nature supplies and how to use all our faculties to the greatest advantage of ourselves and others . . . .' is still embodied in our educational beliefs and Ideals. "Some few years ago the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education set up certain objectives, as follows: 1. Health 2. Command of the fundamental processes 3. Worthy home membership 4. Vocation 5. Civic Education 6. Worthy use of leisure 7. Ethical character "Dean Russel of Columbia University judges a person to be well educated when he has the following characteristics: ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p456">RKI'OKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1. The ability to speak his mother tongue with precision. 2. The power to do. 3. The desire for growth. 4. Gentle and refined manners. He also says that the most important thing in Education is health training. "Since the fundamental ideas of modern education seem to be round in these standards and qualifications, our problem is to deter - mine how and where Home Economics fits in, educationally. '•Worthy home membership is probably the objective towards which Home Economics should make the greatest contribution. " 'Genuine home-making is an exceedingly difficult and supremely important undertaking. It is a business, a science and an art.' The titles of the different units of work offered in our home economics courses are sufficiently descriptive to show that the business of home - making and all that it signifies, is quite appreciated. "Such courses as 'Family Relationship', 'Child Care and Training', .'. •Health and Home Care of the Sick', 'Elementary Nutrition', 'Home Furnishings', 'Clothing Appreciation', 'Economics of Buying' are now being taught in our schools, in addition to the teaching of manipula - tive skills, (Clothing construction and food preparation). All of the above mentioned help to find a satisfactory solution for many of the problems which confront us as we strive toward our ideal of worthy home membership. These courses aim to develop efficiency in analyz - ing and solving the home-making problems of today. All through life tTie girl is facing home problems, whether as a home-maker or not she is confronted with questions having to do with her health, foods, clothing and social relationships. "The way of education is the directing of the girl's mind to the real values of life". This I believe includes a clear-headed evaluation of the worthwhileness of home-making. Statistics tell us that be - tween 85 and 90% of our girls become home-makers. The vision of the high calling of this vocation has been duly appreciated by our great poets and. writers, who h#.ve for years lauded the 'Home'. The story of 'A Lantern in Her Hand', written by Bess Streeter Aldrich, a Nebraska writer, Is one, I wish you could all read. To me,, this story shows the worthwhileness 'Of. home-making. The pioneer mother, denied the fulfillment of her girlhood ambitions. In the development of her own talents, finds happiness in her home and satisfactions in the development of these talents in her children. "The Norwegian maid was right who said: 'Dere is more moneys in America, but in Norway t'ings iss more pretty. Even de kitchen dere is good to see. Dere iss shelves and copper cooking dishes all shiny, all so happy-looking. I like dem way best. It ias better not so much money's to haf; but to be more happy wit one's t'ings!' She </seg>
            <seg id="p457">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION had in her quaint philosophy put the proper value on material posses - sions. Our home economics courses should help our girls realize that they may have attractive homes without luxurious appointments. I recall visiting in a ranch home in the mountains, forty miles from a town in which were the simplest of furnishings but In which the order and arrangement was charming; the bowl of blue mountain (lowers were lovely, the homemaker In that home had many tasks and duties, but she made the most of possibilities at hand and her simple home was a beautiful one. - "A character In one of Zona Gale's stories, voices the sentiment of many home makers, when she says, 'It ain't so much that girls and women — me included — hates cookln' an' houseworkin' — as that they hate the mere, sheer, straightforward drudgery of it. As it is now, there's two kind of women: they's the woman that loves her home, and likes some of the work-in It, and hates some o" it, but that on the whole can do it contented enough because of her love for the folks in her home; — then there's the other kind of woman that puts her housework an' her cookln' first before everything, an' let's the home part, the real home part scrabble along afterwards as best it can — an' half the time she makes her family perfectly miserable doin' the work that was only invented In the first place to make 'em com - fortable. 1 "I believe that elicier.t home economics training does help to lessen the drudgery part of housework. Labor-saving Is being ac - cepted by the modern woman as part of her world and our girls and learning to use such equipment. Household equipment when wisely selected, properly cared for and operated, should give more leisure time to the home maker. Then, too, industry is taking over more and more of the manual work of the home. Home Economics opens up many possibilities for the wise use of leisure' time. "Home Economics contributes in a far-reaching and vital manner to 'Health' In the work it does In nutrition. The selection of the right rood is of great Importance for we know that the lack of the right kind of food has much to do with the high percentage of under - nourishment. More and more, in our modern way of living we find that boys and girls and men and. women, are patronizing the public eating places. Thus, the Importance of correct selection of food for those eating away from home. The home maker should also choose wisely the food for her family, in order that it prove an asset and not a liability to her family's health. "Whoever Is selecting food must think of this selection in regard to its value to the body. Its availability In the community, the cost, the way It is prepared so that no food value is lost. "Girls will' learn, however, that family expenses may be kept down by good nutrition habits. Less money needs to be paid out to </seg>
            <seg id="p458">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the grocer, the butcher, the doctor and dentist. The vegetable garden should be one of the best paying plots of the farm. "We want our girls to have more than a smattering knowledge about food values, more than the little knowledge of the negro woman who said to the grocer: 'Ah wants some cabbage for my chilluns.' 'Why don't you feed 'em some carrots for a change, aunty? They're cheaper and also have food value for growing pickaninnies.' 'No, sah! Now doan you go tell in' me! The Doctor he says to feed 'em green vegetables an' you all know right -well that carrots ain't green!' "The facts of nutrition do affect one's most intimate daily living and our girls learn that there is a direct connection between nutrition and health, which in turn influences, mental habits, disposition and the philosophy of life. Without good food, properly selected and pre - pared and attractively served, we cannot expect enjoy life at the first level. "Every year more and more knowledge is ours as the result of ' the research work being done in many places. Before the war, the greatest of work was done in Germany but since then, to the United States and Germany is credited the greatest amount of the work. Be - cause of the important part proper diet plays in the health question we cannot fail to emphasize the value that, the ability to select the right food has, and the development of a real appreciation of the in - fluence of food upon mental and physical efficiency. The person who understands the principles of nutrition, knows what an adequate diet really means. Such a person would hesitate before indiscriminate diet - ing. Too many people who are overweight or who may wish to be slender, because it is fashionable to follow some diet fad, which may be dangerous to their health. "Dr. McCollum says that the sensible diet for a person wishing to reduce should include the following foods every day: 1 pint milk 2 servings of fruit 2 servings of vegetables (1 raw and 1 green) X potato 1 egg 1 serving of (lean meat, fish, eggs, or cheese) 1 small pat of butter or 1 teaspoon of cod-liver oil. These foods will safeguard health. While overweight is not desirable, neither is dieting to the extent of weakening the body and possibly it is better to be: 'Plump and happy Than thin and snappy!' "Another problem home, economics education is strlring to help its students with In regard to this provision for health, has to do with the selection of suitable clothing. Hygenic requirements as the kind </seg>
            <seg id="p459">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION of underwear, the amount of clothes, and the type of shoes won., ..... their influence on the health question. "When we have reached as near the 100% mark as possible in regard to the health question, I believe we will have crossed a very important milestone toward our ideal of worthy -Home membership. " 'Manners are the minor morals' and the person who has kind and gentle manners holds a magic key. The culture of the heart and mind must be genuine. "The ability to follow the commonly accepted rules of etiquette .is a- help in getting along with other people. The girl who has gentle and refined manners, has good personal habits. Her room is kept in an orderly manner. She has qualities such as courtesy, sympathy, tact, promptness, respect for the rights of others. AH of these quali - ties betoken a sound cultural growth and better lit her for home - making or in her social relations with others. "Since the power to do Is judged to be an important characteristic of the educated person, we can readily see that in this respect home economics education functions very well. "After home economics training, what? We' have already said that between 85 and 90% of our girls choose the vocation of home - making! Others of our home economics trained girls become teachers, others tea room managers, hospital dieticians, clothing specialists, nursery school workers, interior decorators, state and county extension workers, public health workers, scientific research workers, journalists. "The power to do or practical ability Is now rated a little higher than has been the case in the past. The capable, useful person is now the ideal of the genuinely cultured individual. Our home economics girls are not afraid to work. They gain confidence in their own ability as they accomplish results. Self-reliance comes from develop - ment of the power to do. " 'All true work is sacred; In all true work, were it but true hand labor, there is something of divineness.' "There is an interrelation in the values of home economics edu - cation but all of our home economics education should make us better fitted for worthy home membership, which is after all the. •ultimate purpose of our homes. We should like to have all our girls have Cornelia Comer's ideal of a home. . " 'Homes are to other material possessions, what souls are to the bodies, the center from which the life moves outward. " 'When I work hard to make my home more comfortable or more beautiful, I am sending vibrations from my every day world, right into the eternal one.

Gaines of the Extension Service showed the women how to arrange and play simple games. Mr. Gaines said, "Recreation and fun for all in the home is the greatest force in knitting the family together." THURSDAY AFTERNOON The Thursday afternoon meeting was held in joint session with the men. At this session Miss Mason discussed "Home Equipment as a Wise Investment." Miss Mason said: "Improved equipment conditions for the Nebraska farm home - maker may mean that the following changes are brought about in regard to the housekeeping job. 1. There will be a reduction of energy requirement. 2. Housekeeping hours will be shortened. 3. Time and energy saved may be spent in meeting obliga - tions heretofore neglected. . i 4. Certain standards will be raised. It may be any or all . or these or others that might be mentioned — meals on time, house kept cleaner, clothes kept whiter, food better prepared, the family happier and more comfortable. 5. Housekeeping will become a more pleasant task and a more dignified, purposeful job. 6. Tasks which were once heavy or impossible now simplified so that the housewife may accomplish them alone. "Now, how can these changes be classed as an investment? "The rural homemaker may find that more time set free .from, certain time and energy consuming processes in housekeeping can be used very advantageously in assisting her husband with his bookkeep - ing and farm records, or in taking over the entire responsibility for this task. It would be difficult to find anyone who could fulfill the responsibilities of assistant business manager on the farm better than the wife and partner in this home. Again It may be that the money </seg>
            <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION income from time spent In raising poultry or in production 01 uuir.v products would justify the purchase of labor saving devices or the installation of modern conveniences in the home. In a study of the income from productive activities outside the home for Nebraska farm women. Dr. Ruth Clark, of the home economics department, has found that on an average the Nebraska farm women were making 47&lt;! per hour spent with poultry and 4 5c 1 per hour spent with dairy products. "In a recent farm home study made in Oregon it was found that 72 per cent of the homemaker's time went to the routine activities of the household, to meals, cleaning, fires, laundry and mending. "The methods suggested in this study for the reduction of time given to household needs were'tii'eiise of more help, use of commercial services, simplifying of standards,' improvement of methods or the purchase of labor savers. I wojild add to this the installation of .modern lighting, heating or water systems with adequate sewage dis - posal. More time might be given then to other phases of home - making or outside productive activities. "The chief causes of fatigue as given by these Oregon house - wives were too long hours, muscle strain from standing, lifting, etc., nerve strain from Interruptions, emergencies and multiplicity of responsibilities, and poor working conditions in regard to light, ven - tilation and tools. "By good planning ahead you will avoid the purchase of inade - quate tools, inefficient, awkward or uncomfortable to use, causing ac - cidents or unsatisfactory results. "Dr. Andrews of Columbia University in a recent article, 'The Home Woman as Buyer and Controller of Consumption,' appearing in the annuals of the American Academy of Political Science, speak3 of the housewife as the guardian of the home treasury who makes or mars the standard of living by what he calls good 'buy-manship,' which he says requires the answer to the following questions in the selecting and purchasing of equipment: 1.

It is poor economy to tie up money in seldom used or too expensive equipment. Due to a rather recent awakening to the need of labor savers in- the home, many novel con - trivances are being placed . on the market. • The housewife should be sure that these articles are real labor savers instead of labor pro - ducers, that they will be used enough to make their purchase worth - while, and that they are constructed so as to be fool proof, and so that they may give a reasonable amount of service. "The slogan of the manufacturer seems to be a complete set of mechanical labor saving devices for every woman in the country, and their aim is to develop a consciousness of a need for their product. "For the small percentage that belong to the well-to-do class, there is no doubt that the desirable things for health and comfort that money can buy are within the range of possibility. The middle class, on a much less secure footing, must weigh values carefully, purchasing essential items first and additional items as they can be afforded. "My argument is that a safe amount of sales resistance must be built up by every individual to come to his rescue from the time when as a small child he is encouraged to buy a dime's worth of lollypops instead of a nickle's worth because he gets a toy whistle for the extra amount purchased. We are very often duped into paying too much for the whistle. "An encouraging note was sounded in a talk made recently by an official of the American Gas Association when he spoke of the obligation of the industry to sell household appliances on the basis of the service to be performed rather than beauty of color or design, and to service and maintain them throughout their period of useful - ness. When choice of equipment is decided by appearance we should question how much we are paying for this factor and whether it adds to the efficiency of the utensil or to the final result gained. "Standards in regard to the soundness of equipment construction are being improved and there is a brighter outlook than ever before from this standpoint. A constructive discontent is being aroused and its Influence can be detected in the Improved equipment on the market, the sounder type of sales arguments that sales departments are en - couraging, and the absence of much of the shoddy, tin pan type of equipment.

With 95 per cent of our American families in the limited income group, this experimenting must be done before the purchase is made. The aim. of our equipment investigation work in Home Economics Is to' set up minimum standards as to materials, appli - ances, and service rendered so that definite, accurate and understand - able information may be given in regard to equipment on the market. "We are in the pioneer stages of both housing and equipment study. For years our food and clothing consciousness has been played upon by advertisers and sales people. For quite a number of years our research laboratories have been studying foods and their nutri - tional values, and clothing in its economic, hygenlc, and design as - pects, but our equipment research is only about ten years old and Housing research in regard to the individual family needs is still pioneering. We have had facts and opinions before, but applications to Improve situations are only beginning to be made. "The results of a study that should be of interest to home - makers of this section is The Selection and Management of Kerosene Cook Stoves, published in circular 41 by the College of Agriculture Experiment Station.. This work was completed last summer in our research laboratory by Mrs. Edna Snyder who is Research Assistant in our Home Economics department. "Mrs. Snyder analyzed the problem from the viewpoint that the buyer of household equipment is often bewildered by the array of suggestive advertising by which she is surrounded. According to Mrs. Snyder, 'It becomes difficult to judge whether price is an indication of superior performance or merely covers the cost of frequent changes in style. Most people have no opportunity to learn the comparative merits of various products, but buy because of colorful advertisements, clever sales arguments, suggestions of friends or because the local dealer has only one product of a kind to offer." The purpose of her circular is to give information in regard to the advantages and dis - advantages of the various types of kerosene cook stoves on the market, in the hope that such information will be useful to the purchaser In deciding the type best suited to individual needs, and in managing whatever type is selected. "Quoting, from the circular 'The user of any kerosene stove is probably most interested in its capacity to meet the following require - ments: 1. Reasonable speed of heating 2. Reasonable speed of operation 3. Freedom from soot and unpleasant odor 4. Ease of operation and cleaning . </seg>

The short chimney wick type' 3. The short chimney lighting ring type 4. The wickless type.' .&gt; "She also says that fuel is wasted by using utensils which are ' not suited in size to the size of the burner.' From the standpoint of speed and economy, utensils about twice the diameter of the burner are most efficient. Records of soot formation and the formation of odors were kept during the entire study. The short-chimney types with wicks and with lighting rings, formed soot in varying amounts in about 60 per cent of the times the burners were used and the wickless type in 75 per cent. Where the flame is in contact with, or very close to the utensil, it la affected by factors outside the burner, such as draft, drops of water from the utensil or contact with a cold utensil. The distance of the flame from the utensil In the long chimney prevents the formation of soot, if the height of the llaim&gt; is adjusted as directed. "As to type, the long-chimney burner was rated as giving least odor, the lighting ring and wickless as giving most. The wickless type had, in addition to the kerosene odor, the odor of the primer. "A washing machine study is now being completed in our re - search laboratory and will be published In the near future. The aims of this study are: 1. Comparative cleansing action and rapidity of dirt removal. 2. Comparative wear upon fabric. 3. Comparative retention of heat. 4. Constructional features which add to convenience of operation. 5.

Other organizations cooperating in this study are The American Society of Refrigerating Engineers and the American Standards Association. Dr. Louise Stan - ley, Chief of the Bureau of Home Economics at Washington, D. C, in a recent letter gave some facts in regard to a standard name plate that they were recommending for refrigerator manufacturers to place on boxes that have been inspected according to the specifications fixed by this joint group. "Dr. Stanley said that the group agreed that this name plate should contain a statement of the cubic feet of food space available and a statement of temperature maintained under average test con - ditions. Most of them wished also to have some statement of the amount of refrigerant required under the same test conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p465">NKBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "The National Association of Ice Industries has made a study ot refrigerators and out of this has grown three classes: A, B, and C, measured by durability and the amount of space a given weight of ice will cool. "This classification has not been generally accepted by manu - facturers and dealers as yet, though recent reports say that many companies merchandising ice are now also merchandising* these classi - lied refrigerators. We are as yet unable to obtain these classified boxes in Nebraska, but as an outgrowth of this effort of the National Association of Ice Industries and the cooperative work done by our Federal research agencies we may expect something in the near future which will help the housewife in the selection of a refrigerator. "I like to think of time and energy as equipment on hand and you will all agree that making the best use of what we have on hand is the first step in an Improvement program. The house itself may be a labor saver or a labor producer and must enter into this analysis of what we have on hand. "We often do not realize until after the house is built how we are adding to time and energy involved in housekeeping by poorly planned routing of traffic in, out and through the house. We all realize the problems that arise because of a poorly arranged kitchen and you all know how annoying it is to have the line of traffle coming in from the outside to living room, dining room, office or upstairs, cross your path as you work from preparation center to the stove, from wood box to stove or from serving center to the dining room. An outstanding situation that I believe every housewife agrees should be eliminated from the kitchen is the use of the kitchen sink as a place for the men to wash. A washroom or at least a place for the men to wash should be accessible near the back entrance before enter - ing the other rooms of the house. If running water Is not available, a wash bench, water pail' and basin may be placed in the entrance rather than in the kitchen. "Limiting the doors to the kitchen will help to eliminate unneces - sary traffic' through the kitchen. There must be the dining room door and the door leading to the outside. It is also desirable to be able to reach the foot of the stairs or a downstairs bed room without going through dining room or living room. This might call for a door leading from the kitchen to a central or back hallway. If there is an outside door to the passage way and if the distance is not too great, this might be our only outside exit from the kitchen. "It should be possible for anyone coming In from the back of the house to' go directly to the dining room without entering the kitchen. This is especially desirable if there is hired help for any length of time during the year. "Traffic and confusion may be further eliminated by making It possible to ice the refrigerator or nil the wood box from the outside. </seg>
            <seg id="p466">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE If it can be arranged to have .a cold storage pantry, near the back entrance to the kitchen with the door to the cellar or basement near by and the refrigerator in or hear this same unit with supply and preparation units adjoining, we have an efficient concentration of storage and preparation units. Anyone bringing in supplies does not interfere with meal preparation and there is less tracking across the floor, which in turn eliminates much of the cleaning. "If we minimize traffic, the kitchen may be made smaller. This will lessen the necessary steps for the housewife in kitchen processes. To be efficient the kitchen should not be too large and 120 square feet for the farm kitchen in which more than one may have to work at the same time is probably the minimum floor area that should be allowed. "Comfortable positions at work are just as important for the housewife as for the stenographer, the telephone operator or the in - dividual worker. Conservation of energy is not an indication of lazi - ness. Our great grandmothers prided themselves on their power of endurance and might have frowned at the kitchen stool as a mark of indolence, but it ranks with comfortable shoes in alleviating the fatigue of a hard day's work. "The right working heights are essential for comfortable work. Six or eight inches from the level of the work table to the level of the elbow is right for most people. There should be this same rela - tion when the worker is seated on a stool. The position for ironing requires a working level about two inches lower than for manipula - tion processes such as meal preparation or dish washing. If the rim of the sink is on a level with the work table, the floor of the sink is too low for the dish washing process. The dish pan should be raised by placing a simply constructed rack in the floor of the sink. "I hesitate to mention a foot rest for the kitchen stool, but as manufacturers are beginning to construct stools with foot rests other than the rounds of the stool, it may not be too extravagant an idea. I would even venture to advise a back rest. "There may be an objection to a foot rest on the stool as this adds to the weight and makes it inconvenient to move the stool about. I suggest that if there is this objection that the foot rest be bracketed to the wall so that it may extend out under the work surface. In this way, providing the work surface does not have built-in cabinet space extending to the floor beneath it, the worker may be seated facing her work, with back straight, arms in the right position for easy work, feet resting comfortably on a substantial foot rest, dis - counting any fatigue except that involved in the process she may be doing. As a further suggestion I would insist that this stool have a revolving swivel seat and that it be mounted on easy rolling casters. </seg>
            <seg id="p467">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "Another Investment that may be appreciated, by all members 01 the family is the household tool kit. These tools should be of good quality and should be marked so that they may not become confused with the garage tools. "The last suggestion that I will make is in regard to safety pre - cautions in the home. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company made the statement for last year that approximately 24,000 persons lost their lives during last year through accidents occurring in their homes. Among school children more accidents occurred in the home than on the street, in the school or on school grounds. Most of these accidents could be prevented. Falls cause more than one-third of the home accidents in the United States and more than half of the falls are met witll by elderly persons. "The causes of falls are given as poorly built step ladders, sub - stitutions for step ladders, poorly lighted halls or stairways, stairs or steps too steep or stair carpet insecurely fastened. Slippery floors, .skidding rugs, and chairs or children's toys obstructing passage ways. "In planning and furnishing the home and in purchasing equip - ment for the home the safety, health, and comfort factors Involved should receive adequate consideration. Quoting from a study of standards of living for American homes, the following statement seems applicable in closing: 'The expenditure for pictures, books, musical instruments, (and radios) contribute meagerly toward raising the standard of living if leisure time Is not available for the appre - ciation of the pictures, reading the books or enjoying the music (or radio). The standards of living cannot be raised effectively through the expenditure of more money, if long monotonous hours of labor prevent the fullest use of goods obtainable with more ample funds'." Mr. William J. Loeffel of the Nebraska College of Agriculture next demonstrated the preparation of the wholesale cuts of pork. Mr. Loeffel urged the use of a good sharp knife as he demonstrated the various cuts. "Hams and shoulders cure nicely if they are neatly trimmed," he said. "The trimmings may be used in sausage." Mr. Loeffel showed his audience how to make attractive cuts from the less tender cuts of lamb. By removing the bones an attractive rolled shoulder roast was ma'de. A double slice of the neck makes an ideal piece for braising. The premier cut was the crown roast of lamb which is easily prepared in the home. By spending a little time in the prepara - tion of the less tender cuts before they are cooked, they may be made pleasing' to the eye, easy to carve and tender and juicy. "Since Ne - braska ranks second as a lamb producing state, lamb should be more generally used," Mr. Loeffel said. </seg>

It was called to order at 9:30 A. M. by the President, Mr. Loy Franklin of Falls City, Nebraska. Members of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is with pleasure that I greet you at this, the opening session of the Sixty-second Annual Meeting of the Nebraska State Horticul - tural Society, and I wish you health, happiness and success m your work m 1931. Although it seems to be the custom for the Chairman to make a few remarks at the opening of this annual meeting, 'I tried to have the Secretary, Mr. Hoppert, omit my name from the program; but' this he refused to do. In looking over some of the old reports of this Society, I notice that some of the problems which the Nebraska Pioneers of Horticul- </seg>
            <seg id="p472">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE ture had, we are not troubled with so much today, and we have a number of problems which they never even thought or heard of. In the Annual Report of this Society for the year 1897 there is no mention made of Spray Schedules; Date of Emergence of the Codling Moth; Control of the Oriental Fruit Moth, or any one of the numerous other pests of the present day orchardist. But their problems seemed to center on what varieties of apples to plant; how to sell what fruit they did raise, and convincing' the Nebraska consumer that Nebraska apples were good to eat. This last problem we are still working on and there are still some people that are surprised at the display of Nebraska grown fruit at the State Fair, and are not easily convinced that the fruit is grown in Nebraska. In this same report I also find that the estimated amount of New York and Michigan apples shipped into the state for Nebraska consumption was two hundred carloads. We have the same compe - tition to face now, only instead of New York and Michigan, our chief worry is from the competitive districts of Idaho and Colorado. I be - lieve if the growers in this section will grade closely and put up a good uniform pack, the Nebraska consumer will become acquainted with the merits of our fruit, and will demand Nebraska apples in preference to shipped-in apples. And in the large apple markets, if we meet our competitor's quality and pack with an equal quality and pack, I see no reason why Missouri Valley apples will not command as high a price or even sell at a premium over apples from other districts. Another source of trouble to the orchardist is the lied Cedar tree, which causes great damage to some varieties of apple trees. The Jonathan and Wealthy seem to be injured the most; and as the Jona - than is one of the most valuable and productive apples in this sec - tion, the loss to the fruit men reaches quite a figure annually. In Richardson county the orchard owners and fruit growers in and around Shubert formed a Cedar Tree Eradication Organization, which was fairly successful, being instrumental in the removal of several hundred cedar trees in that immediate vicinity. The organi - zation used educational methods in inducing the owners of the cedars to dispose of the offending trees. Secretary Hoppert aided materially in this by meeting with the growers and their neighbors in several ' meetings and explaining in a convincing manner the life cycle of the cedar rust spores. As an inducement to the owners of the cedar trees, the orchard men agreed to replace each cedar tree destroyed with some other evergreen tree or any kind of fruit tree. This in many cases helped the farmer to decide to cut his cedar trees. The Midwest Horticultural Exposition had a very instructive pro - gram and a fine fruit and flower show at Shenandoah, Iowa, November 11th to 16th. Nebraska fruit was most conspicuous by its almost total absence from the show. As there was a large crowd in attend - ance almost every day it seems that more of our Nebraska growers </seg>
            <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY should have availed themselves of this good opportunity to advertise our apples. At the Second Annual Meeting of the Missouri Valley Horticul - tural Conference at Kansas City, December 11th and 12th, a very interesting and instructive program was presented. A fine talk was given by Prof. Charles S. Wilson, Washington, D. C, on "The Federal Farm Board Can Aid Fruit Growers." In his talk Professor Wilson emphasised the necessity of. the fruit growers co-operating and forming associations before they could secure aid from the Federal Farm Board.. I believe the 'Nebraska growers should plan to meet annually with the other Missouri Valley growers and in that way become better acquainted with our neighbors in this same Midwest District. I will now review briefly some of the work done during the sum - mer by this Society. At the annual meeting of the board in June, it was decided that owing to the small apple crop In prospect, we would not have our orchard tour in 1930; but to wait and hope for a crop large enough to be of interest to the orchard men as well as others interested in horticulture. We hope it will be this year. Pros - pects are favorable for a good bloom, as most apple trees seem to show large, well developed buds, which usually prove to be fruit buds. At this meeting the board members formed plans for the fruit exhibit at the State Fair and some discussion was had concerning moving the horticulture exhibit from the west to the east end of the Agriculture Building. This was made necessary by the large illustrated map of Nebraska which the State Board of Agriculture had placed in our former location. It is not definitely settled where the horticulture exhibit will be placed at the State Fair this year. I believe it would be a good plan to appoint a committee to meet with the State Fair board, to help us get a suitable location. I think this Society owes Professors Hoppert, Wiggins and Yocum a vote of thanks for the very attractive display of apples at the 1930 Nebraska State Fair. I think this exhibit was one of the feature attractions in the Agricultural Building. Secretary Hoppert also planned to make a display of fruit for the Society at the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show, at the Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum in Omaha. This display attracted much attention. In fact so much attention was manifest by some, that Secretary Hoppert found it neces - sary to erect a chicken wire netting to protect the fruit. Our Secretary made a trip into some of the neighboring states, and he will give us an illustrated lecture on "Fruit Growing in Some of the Other Mid-western States," during our meeting Thursday. He will report more fully on some of this, organization's other activities. I do not wish to take any more of your time, so we will proceed with the program. The first number on our program is "How Bees Keep the Fruit Growers of Michigan," by R. H. Kelty, Michigan Agri - cultural College, East Iiansing, Michigan. </seg>
            <seg id="p474">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOW BRES KEEP THE FRUIT GROWERS OF MICHIGAN By MR. R. H. KELTY, Michigan Agricultural College, East Lansing, Michigan MR. KJELTY: Mr. Chairman and Members of the Nebraska Horti - cultural Society: In the very beginning I want to make an explanation, not an apology. I am not a fruit grower, and not a horticulturist. Two years ago the administration of our College was so arranged that it put part of my work in the Extension Department and partly in the Horticultural Department. Previous to that time my work had been confined to only one line, namely, bee keeping. lit making this change it was hoped to work out the details of handling bees in orchards in such a way as to benefit the setting of fruit crops. The problem of pollination had been given very little intensive study previous to 1925, but since that time we have learned quite a few facts concerning the matter and I'm sure you'll be interested in a discussion of our experiences. The increasing use of bees to secure more efficient pollination in Michigan orchards has compelled many orchard owner to decide whether it is cheaper to buy or to rent the colonies they wish to use. Before we take up some of the factors that may assist in making a decision I want to show you some slides taken in Michigan orchards. These slides are not all my original work, but they are slides that will show the kind of. work we are doing in the Department of Horti - culture. I will try to briefly describe them as they are thrown on the screen. This is a county map of the state of Michigan. It shows the outline of the state. It is in the lower peninsula of the state that the fruit industry thrives most. The division of the state by Lake Michigan and Lake Huron has a tempering effect on the climate, and it makes our struggle against pests much easier. This slide shows the wind currents across the United States and it is noticeable that as far as Michigan is concerned, all of the winds we get our due westerly or north-westerly across Lake Michigan. This shows the weather temperatures both winter and summer. Notice that the temperatures are almost constant for a distance of 160-180 miles along the lake shores. The fruit belt of Michigan is right in this area along the lakes where the tempering of the weather is most noticeable. Wherever there are promontories Jutting out into the lakes, these areas are generally planted to fruit since such areas are especially safe from frosts and winter injury. This is a view taken in the autumn and shows fall conditions. The wind conditions run almost due north and south in this area near the water and this region is practically safe for ten to twenty days </seg>
            <seg id="p475">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY later than areas ten or twelve miles inland. This is one reason wny the fruit Industry has grown up along the west coast of Michigan. Now some of this material will be A-B-C to many of you but at that there are 'points that will be brought out later that we want to Include in this analysis. We want to remind you in order to get down to fundamentals that it is necessary to have the pollen trans - ferred from the stamens to the pistils. The pollen grain germinates and grows down the pollen tube and into the ovules. If this does not take place the flower drops off without forming fruit. We find in these studies some flowers are self-fertile and some are self-sterile. A variety is self-fertile when its pollen can be used on its own flower and fruit will result. A variety is self-sterile when its pollen will not serve to fertilize its own flowers. From these studies we conclude that some varieties that were previously called self-fertile are not commercially so. I mean thereby that in some cases varieties were considered self-fertile years ago and planted in large blocks that today would not be considered so since a heavy set can not be de - pended upon in the average year. This slide" merely shows a colony of bees in an orchard. When the flowers are in bloom .the bees seek the nectar at the bottom of the flower and in getting it, the pollen on the stamens adheres to the body and legs of the little insect. As the next flower is visited the pollen grains so gathered may be brushed against the end of the pistil of another flower and one or more adhere to the end of the pistil. Here, then, is the way the bee helps the fruit grower. This is an actual photograph taken in the field. It shows the bees working on the apple blossoms. It shows how they actually distribute the pollen. This can be accomplished artificially with a camel's hair brush. The honey bee is not the only insect that helps distribute pollen. There are 40 or 50 others but nearly all of the others are solitary insects, that is they live singly or in very small groups and not in hives like the honey bee. For this reason fruit growers could not domesticate them easily. Some of these other, insects like the bumble bee for example are not trustworthy. They may take a notion to work on other things than the ones we'd like to have them work on. Not so the honey bee. It likes fruits of all kinds and is a dependable worker. Furthermore their habits are such that they can be cared for easily in very large numbers. Now in a plan for planting orchards as result of our study we have found this recommendation worth while. That is that the fruit grower should plant not more than four rows of a particular variety without then putting in a row of some good cross pollinizer every fifth row. He should not over-lap on this cross polllnizatlon. I don't suppose this will apply to Nebraska. It has been done with good results in Michigan. You can take Ben Davis, Jonathans, Wagnors, </seg>
            <seg id="p476">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AfiKICUI/IURK or Dutchess or whatever variety you want to select and you will linii most of them satisfactory. Now the next picture is used to explain how experiments in 1!I26 and 1927 and shows merely what was done in coming back to the spy. The use of bees on these 22 acres, of spy is required about forty colonies. . . Now we have some slides that show, what has been done by Mr. Qruggeman. Those buckets were distributed .among the bees, out among the trees, so the results could be watched, and study made of the use for the bees of the different varieties. A noticeable difference was found where the buckets were not set in bad wind conditions. A record was kept of the results between various locations. The distance the buckets were set from the trees likewise had a decided effect. ' ■•.... - ■ We come now to a picture where there is no bloom, no bouquets, and they get new results of cross-pollinization. Here is an average of 4% in comparison with a 30 r /c average where the proper setting exists. The owner of this tract has taken an average of !)00 bushels on this twenty-two acres pictured here in years past, but previous to the experiment worked there he got only 2 00 bushels, the largest crop he had secured up to that lime. We could go on indefinitely and cite illustrations like this. Now this is another picture along the same line. Here is where a 200% result has been obtained, but you cannot expect much unless applied properly, in getting good results. In the next view, we tried out a new wrinkle, in getting new bouquets, set more properly. These were placed entirely in the branches, where the bees could work on them, where they would nat - urally come In such contact as to bring about cross-pollinization. We found out In this orchard in several places this improvement could be secured. We found such a substantial difference in the parts of the orchard from where no pollinization was effected, with the results so favorable to the places where the buckets were set. On one big spy tree where 27 buckets were set they got-a yield I believe of 5G bushels of good apples with practically no drops. This is the tree I just spoke about. We are going to show you some views around Grand Rapids, where they have worked on peach orchards. These trees belonged to Mr. H. M. Peck who placed the buckets as shown in the trees. We can also show similar results that worked in cherry trees. Now, diverting from these slides to the subject of "Renting or Keeping Bees For Use in the Orchard." The purchase price of a colony of bees is not the final considera - tion. After buying the bees, the. fruit-grower will find that, willingly or unwillingly, he must master some of the fundamental principles </seg>
            <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY of beekeeping practice and give the bees the necessary amount ot attention and seasonal manipulation or his original investment may depreciate as much' as 50 per cent per year. ? This is as true when the sole interest in the bees is for pollination purposes as it is when it is expected that the bees will earn their "keep" by producing honey. Unless bees are given the necessary at - tention in fall to prepare them for winter, they may be dead by the following May; and, if the colony is not properly manipulated in May, the bees may become so weakened by swarming that the colony will contain but few active field-workers, and large number of field bees is the chief value of the colony for pollination. When the supering season approaches, the fruit-grower who hopes to harvest a honey crop, find's it necessary to invest nearly as much In supers and equipment as the bees cost originally. If the surrounding district is favorable to honey production, the bees may return' from 10% to 25% on the investment in the form of honey, each year. On the other hand, if the location is not favorable to the secre - tion of nectar by the clovers and wild flowers, the fruit-grower may find it necessary to feed each colony a dollar's worth of sugar syrup each fall and spring or move the apiary to a more favorable location during the period of nectar secretion to get the desired strength of colony for the fruit bloom period. The bees do their best work in pollination when the hives are distributed about 200 feet apart throughout the orchard. Intensive orchard practice outside the blooming period will be hampered by any but the very gentlest bees. It is possible that, on some occasions, the bees will be a positive nuisance when distributed in the orchard. It may become necessary to use a permanent location at some distance from the orchards and move the bees Into and out of the orchards as they, are needed. This problem of moving the bees safely and prop - erly will be discussed later. The owner of extensive orchards whose pollination problem re - quires the use of one hundred or more colonies of bees, is, if he owns his own apiary, in the beekeeping business whether he realizes it or not. He cannot afford to run so many colonies on the "let-alone plan." This means that either he or some member of his working force must devote at least four hours per colony each year to the active and in - telligent manipulation of the apiary. Inexperienced beekeepers may find that the required manipulation takes nearer 10 hours per colony each year as they are not In position to use the labor short-cuts which are practiced by extensive beekeepers without damaging the colonies. There is the ever-present possibility that the apiary may become infected with foulbrood. Fortunately, this hazard has been greatly diminished by the active, state-wide eradication campaign against foul - brood carried on by the State Department of Agriculture, but the foulbrood hazard must not be overlooked or under-estimated by any prospective beekeeper. . . ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p478">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AOR1CULTURE Vhe chief advantage to the fruit-grower of owning his own apiary is the certainty that he will have the bees when he wants them. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that careful manipulation of col - onies in spring will be necessary to bring these colonies to a strength of population comparable to colonies owned by commercial beekeepers whose income depends on the honey-gathered power of each colony.

The proper method for handling package bees is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p479">• NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Order three-pound packages with Queens from a reliable shipper 60 to 90 days in advance of the desired date of arrival. Packages should be received April 15 to May 1 for best results. A few days before arrival the buyer should make arrangements with the local express agent to receive notice by telephone as soon as the bees, are received. An extra day in the express office may do the bees some harm. If a large portion of the bees are dead on arrival, a "Bad Order" statement should be secured from the express agent and forwarded to the shipper immediately, who will replace the loss promptly and also file claim for damages. If the bees are in acceptable condition, they should be removed to a cbpl, dark room for a few hours, during which period the screened sides of the packages should be repeatedly painted with a sugar syrup made of equal parts of cane or beet sugar and warm water. This will quiet the bees. The hives in which the bees are to be placed should be placed in the location they are to occupy permanently or during the blooming period. Each hive should be equipped with four frames containing full sheets of foundation, an inner cover with feeder-hole in the center and an empty super in which to place the feeder. The entrance to the hive should be contracted to one inch and be screened until dark. When the bees have become quiet after feeding, take the packages to the apiary. To install the packages, remove the cover of the pack - age, take out the queen-cage, which is usually suspended on a wire, and fasten the cage to a tack driven in the top of a center frame so that the queen cage will hang between the frames near the top. At this time, the pasteboard which covers the opening to the queen-cage candy is removed. Test the candy with a tooth pick, and, if hardened, make a hole through the candy no larger than a match. Release the bees by placing the package on its side in the hive beside the frames of foundation where the queen cage is fastened, with the opening of the cage toward the queen. The bees will be attracted by the odor of their queen and leave the package to form a cluster about the queen cage. Place an inner cover over the hive and invert a pepper-box type feeder, made by punching several holes in the lid of a friction top pail, over the hole in the inner cover. The feeder should be filled with warm sugar syrup made by dissolving one pound of sugar in one pint of water. An empty super is placed on the hive to help keep the syrup warm and also to lessen the danger of robbing. The screen may be removed from the entrance to the hive the first evening unless the wind is strong, in which case It will be as well to confine the bees for a few days to lessen the danger of "drifting." If the weather is warm, the bees must be released or they might smother. </seg>
            <seg id="p480">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE xi is now considered best to do nothing whatever to the newly - introduced bees for a period of a week after the packages have been installed except to give them more sugar syrup as fast as it Is used. Each package should be fed 20 to 30 pounds of syrup during the first 10 days, even if there is an abundance of bloom. If the bees are gathering nectar heavily they will not take the syrup, but if they need food, they need it badly. On a warm day about a week after the package is placed in the hive the empty package may be removed and the remaining frames of foundation placed in the hive. The four frames on which the bees are clustered should be placed in the center of the hive, the new frames being placed on either side. Continue feeding if necessary. Make certain that the queen has been released from her cage, and hastily examine the newly made comb for the presence of eggs or brood. The queen should be laying freely a week after arrival. Do not manipulate the bees more than to continue feeding if necessary, until several combs have been drawn out from foundation and filled with honey and brood. Otherwise the bees may kill their queen. Sometimes bees may be purchased locally at bargain prices. A fair price for a good strong colony of Italian bees, in a good hive, preferably a 10-frame hive, with plenty of honey to carry the bees and their brood until the next honey flow, is from eight to twelve dollars for a one-story hive, and from 10. to 12 dollars for a two - story hive. • The colony must be free from foulbrood, in fact the Michigan law forbids the sale of bees without a permit which is issued by the State Department of Agriculture only after an inspection shows that the colony is disease-free. A permit must also be obtained to move the bees to their new location. These regulations do not apply to the purchase of package bees, but they do apply to the purchase of nuclei, which are small colonies composed of two or three combs of emerg - ing brood and bees, usually shipped from the Gulf States in the same manner as package bees. With brood and honey present, these nuclei may transmit foulbrood but packages of bees, which are fed on sugar syrup while in transit, should be disease-free. If the fruit grower wishes to avoid the possibility of being unable to obtain sufficient rental bees to fill his pollination requirements, and, at the same time, finds that the prospect of a nectar-flow from the local flowers is remote, he may still make certain of strong colonies for the blooming season by purchasing each spring one 3-pound package of bees for each colony needed, to be used during the blooming season only. In that case, the amount of equipment required would be re - duced to a minimum, and it is possible that some arrangement could be made for disposing of the bees after the blooming season, the fruit grower retaining his hives for more package bees the next season. </seg>
            <seg id="p481">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY By this plan, it the bees were allowed to die after the blooming buubuu, the cost in addition to the original investment for hives, which should not exceed five dollars per colony, would be approximately five dollars per colony per year. If the bees were sold after the blooming season, the cost should not exceed two dollars per colony per year. The advantage of this plan over the rental proposition would be the cer - tainty of having a supply of bees when they are wanted, and it is possible that, with a favorable season, the bees would live over with a minimum expenditure of labor and feed. With the rapidly increas - ing acreage of sweet clover, locations which are not now favorable for honey production, may be greatly improved.' The choice of a suitable location for an apiary which is to be used mainly for pollination purposes depends upon the abundance of nectar-bearing plants in the immediate vicinity. Bees fly freely for distances of about two miles in mid-summer when the weather is favorable, but in spring, especially during fruit-bloom season, weather conditions may be so unfavorable to bee flight that they do not satis - factorily "cover" areas of more than an acre or two of mature orchard. Therefore, even if the immediate locality is so favorable to beekeeping that it is deemed advisable to locate the permanent apiary in or at one side of the orchard, best results in pollination will be obtained when the colonies are distributed throughout the orchard at intervals of about 200 feet. To. avoid losses of bees which will return to former locations if less than two miles from their new quarters, move the apiary a week before blossoming season to some new location at least three miles away and leave the bees there until ready to return them to the orchard . Bees seem to retain the sense of location for about four days, so the apiary should be left in the new location about one week for safety. Then the hives may be relocated throughout the orchard with - out appreciable loss of bees which return to the permanent apiary site. A little straw or brush loosely placed over'the entrance when the bees are relocated in the orchard will help them to orient themselves in their new location. If quite a few bees are noticed flying about the permanent apiary site, they may be saved by placing one or two hives, which contain two combs of emerging brood and bees on the old stand. These returning bees will cluster in these hives at night fall and accept their new home, whereas they would otherwise cluster on the ground and perish. The moving of bees is a job that requires careful preparation to avoid trouble and loss. The first consideration is to provide sur - ficlent ventilation to avoid smothering the bees while they are . in transit; yet, in cool weather, too much ventilation may chill some 'brood. If the weather is warm, 80 degrees Fahrenheit, when ready to move the bees, each strong colony should be given a screened, empty super on top of the brood nest in which to cluster during the trip. </seg>
            <seg id="p482">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE it the weather is cool, say 40 degrees, then a screen In full-width entrance, %"xl4", or better %"xl4", will suffice for average strength colonies. Extra strong colonies should always be given clustering space on top except in very cool weather. Whoever takes bees on the highway becomes liable for damages following injury suffered by the public. Therefore the hive parts should be well stapled together and absolutely bee-tight prior to moving. The work of stapling and screening should be done dur - ing mid-day when the bees are flying freely so that they will have quieted down by dusk. The entrances are then screened, and the hives are ready to move. If convenient, it is safer to move the bees during the night, so that the entrances may be opened -as soon as the hives are placed in the new location. By morning the bees will have quieted down and there will be less danger of "drifting" from hive to hive. It will be well also to place the hives in a broken line to assist the bees in locating their own hive, and if there is much wind, sprinkle some straw lightly over the entrance. To be of service to the fruit-grower for pollination, each colony should contain a minimum population of about three pounds, about 15,000 bees. Such a colony would not be considered strong by a bee - keeper. May 1, and the average colony In commercial practice will have a greater population by fruit bloom time. Weak colonies require the services of the majority of the colony for hive duty, with the re - sult that there are few bees remaining to fly out, even in favorable weather. Strong colonies not only provide many thousand more field bees, they will be active under weather conditions which might pre - vent flight from weaker colonies. A fair price for the rental of a colony of. bees during the bloom - ing season depends on several factors. From the standpoint of the orchardist, a very strong colony may easily be worth twice as much as a weak one. From the beekeeper's standpoint, if there is danger of the bees becoming Infected with foulbrood during their stay in the orchard, a rental price equal to the value of the bees and equipment might not be attractive because any labor involved in the transaction would be wasted, inasmuch as the law requires the destruction of foulbrood colonies by the inspector. If there were danger of loss of bees from spray poisoning, then the rental price should cover the value of the bees and the labor and moving charges. If the beekeeper could be certain that the bees would collect enough nectar from fruit-bloom to appreciably strengthen the colonies, this factor would be an important consideration. Unfortunately, the weather is likely to be so variable at the blooming season that the amount of honey stored from fruit blossoms may range from merely enough to maintain the daily needs of the hive, up to a maximum of 30 to 40 pounds per colony. Also since the dandelion is in bloom at the same period as the fruit trees, it is often true that the bee - </seg>
            <seg id="p483">-NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY keeper's prospect of securing honey from dandelions in his own locality is ' as good as is the prospect of securing fruit-bloom honey in an orchard. - Therefore, it would seem that no definite estimates can be made on the probable benefit to the beekeeper from honey stored in orchards. The disturbances produced by moving colonies may affect the progress of brood-rearing. When properly done, moving bees short distances is not likely to be harmful. However, there is some danger of losing the queen in an occasional colony from "balling;" there is always a possibility of breaking combs from rough handling or acci - dents, and strong colonies which are not properly screened may be suffocated. All of these risks diminish in proportion to the knowledge and experience of the beekeeper, and, for that reason, it is probable that the fruit-grower will get better satisfaction from an experienced beekeeper who is in position to give "service 1 * as well as full strength colonies. Since the labor and expense of moving bees to and from the orchard is a major item, and varies with the distance, and since, in many cases, the fruit-grower might prefer to use his own truck for moving rather than to hire the beekeeper to do the work, it is sug - gested that a fair basis for considering rental prices for colonies is to make a definite charge for the use of the bees, per colony, plus the cost of moving. This rental charge, per colony, varies widely. Some orchardists have been able to rent bees for one dollar per colony. No fruit-grower would expect much "service" from the beekeeper at that price. Sev - eral large lots of bees have been rented for two dollars per colony, plus the cost of moving. Considering the risks for the beekeeper, this is a better bargain for the fruit-grower than for the beekeeper unless a nice crop of honey is gathered from the fruit-bloom. In some other states, notably New Jersey, rental prices for colonies range higher, from five to ten dollars per colony, depending on the distance the bees are moved by the beekeeper himself. Naturally, the matter of rental price will adjust itself with the supply and demand. If future relations are marked by the same high degree of co-operation which has been evidenced thus far, the problem of a fair rental for colonies will be worked out to the mutual benefit of both orchardists and beekeepers. </seg>
            <seg id="p484">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE VINEYARD SOIIi MANAGEMENT EXPEKIMENTS C. C. WIGGINS In an effort to learn something more about the effect of various soil treatments upon the growth and production of grapes the de - partment of Horticulture of the Nebraska . College of Agriculture set in 1923 approximately one acre of Concord grapes. These were planted at the Union Fruit Farm with 8 foot spacing in rows 9 feet apart and 36 plants per row. The rows run north and south and the ground slopes slightly to the north. The soil is loessial in character but is not of the pure type. Through previous cultivation and crop - ping it had become somewhat worn but not to the extent that pre - vented good plant growth. There was established at first simply a comparison of mulching and cultivation. Many growers, particularly those with only a few plants, had been using, apparently successfully, an application of straw to keep down weeds and conserve moisture and at the same time eliminate the necessity for cultivation. No direct comparison of the values of the two systems was available. Accordingly therefore, four middles have been mulched yearly since 1923 with wheat straw so that a mulch several inches deep has been maintained. Records are taken from the two middle rows. In 1928 some other features were also added — the rows to be used here having previously had clean cultivation. For the last three years, then, the following plats have been under observation. 1. Mulching — annually. 2. Clean cultivation. 3. Clean cultivation in early season — with a light mulch ' of straw applied in June. 4. Clean cultivation in early season — followed by a legume cover crop, usually soybeans. 5. Scraping — no stirring of the soil. 6. Clean cultivation — combined with the annual use of sodium nitrate ( M lb. per plant). 7. Mulching — combined with the annual use of sodium nitrate (% lb. per plant). 8. Clean cultivation — combined with the annual use of ammon - ium sulphate (1/5 lb. per plant). Each treatment includes at least 36 plants and in several instances two full rows. Buffer rows separate the various blocks and thus pre - vent the effect of one treatment interfering with that of another. The plants were trellised at the proper time and have been given uniform pruning treatment. No serious damage at any time has re - sulted from either insect or disease outbreaks and consequently little or no spraying has been necessary.- </seg>

Growth Measurements The figures on growth are available on the mulched and cul - tivated blocks for a six year period and on the mulched nitrate block for 3 years. These results are given in tabular form. (See Table No. I.) In general it may be said that plants in the mulched block aver - aged about 25% more total length than did plants under clean cul - ture. This ratio applies to both cane and lateral growth. The mois - ture content table will possibly furnish a reason for this condition. The addition of nitrate to the mulch seemed to stimulate about 10% additional growth. Apparently the addition of some quickly available nitrogen was an advantage, particularly if this was avail - able early in the season. Yields Relatively good yields have been secured. Records for. the past three years are shown for the eight different treatments in the fol - lowing table. (See Table No. II.)' Evidently mulching does not have a favorable effect on the yield since all mulched plants were markedly lower in yield than the cul - tivated blocks. Evidence to show that nitrogen applications were of value is lacking.

The nitrate content of the upper part of the cultivated soil was greater than the mulched soil in the early part of the season. This Is evidenced also by the yellowish, slow, early growth made by the mulched plants. However, in the latter part of the summer this difference largely disappeared. 2. The addition of either sodium nitrate or ammonium sulphate made a marked difference in the soil nitrate content. This difference gradually disappeared as the season advanced. 3.

            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL. SOCIETY Mulching has had a very beneficial effect on soil moisture in tho upper foot throughout this test. Undoubtedly this explains the greater growth made by the mulched plants.' Relatively little difference was noted in the other blocks although the 1930 increase in the cultiva - tion cover crop rows may be indicative of an increased amount of organic matter in this soil. General Conclusions From the tests reported herewith there is an apparent loss of productiveness when grape soils are covered with a straw mulch. This occurs in spite of the fact that such soils generally have a higher moisture content in the upper foot. Possibly the lack of avail - able nitrates in the early growth period may be partially responsible for this lack of production. The addition of available nitrates did not overcome the unproductive condition. Mulched grapes generally made a greater vegetative growth as measured by length of cane and lateral development but such increased growth did not occur in early, summer. The later growth on such plants has to date not made them any more susceptible to winter injury than those under other methods of culture. The addition of readily available forms of nitrogen has increased the soil nitrate content but this has had little or no effect upon pro - ductivity. Nitrate of soda has increased the growth on mulched plants by about 10%. In the various blocks involving variations of clean cultivation no significant differences have as yet been indicated. Scraping seems to be just as desirable as stirring the soil. The use of a covercrop may eventually prove to be valuable because of Its effect of increasing the organic content of the soil.

            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY on the first floor of the Plant Industry Building was too small to hold all the people that came to hear the talks. Many had to be turned away for lack of room. The remainder of the sessions were devoted to fruit topics. Dr. A. E. Murneek of the University of Missouri at Columbia was the principal out of state speaker on this program. In addition. Forester I. T. Bode of Ames, Iowa, discussed . the possibilities or nut growing and Wm. Ablldgaard of Lansing, Mich., discussed stationary spray outfits and fruit washers. State Fair and Ak-Sar-Ben Exhibits . Another of the major activities of the society was the sponsoring of horticultural exhibits, at the State Fair in cooperation with the Board of Agriculture. These consisted of fruits, flowers, and nursery stock. The fruit and flower exhibits had to be moved toward the east side of Agricultural Hall because the feature state display occupied the space previously given over to a feature apple display. Unfor - tunately there was insufficient ice box room for the professional flor - ists' exhibits, but other than this everything went off unusually well. The surprising thing about the flower displays was the unusually large number of entries in the amateur classes, again showing the wide - spread interest in ornamental gardening. The educational display put on by the members of the Nebraska Nursery Men consisting of shrubs and trees in a garden setting with pool and garden seat at - tracted a great deal of attention. The Governors of the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show again requested an apple display to add interest to their stock show and a display de - picting the changes in commercial apple production was featured. In the early day the Nebraska orchards contained many different var - ieties of good, bad or indifferent quality and color. Today consumers demand color, .size and quality. National Horticultural Council The Nebraska Horticultural Society has been a member of the National Horticultural Council for the past three years. During that time the activities of the council have been directed largely toward legislative matters at ■ Washington. The Council helped secure in - creased duties for fruits and vegetables in the Agricultural Marketing Act against powerful opposition; it helped secure an appropriation of $100,000 for the investigation of the Oriental Fruit Moth. The National Horticultural Council is anxious to continue to serve the Horticultural interests of this country and has the backing of the American Pomological Society. It asks that a representative of this society be sent as a delegate to Its annual meeting at Wash - ington, D. C, on January 28th. Furthermore it asks that the support of the' Nebraska Horticultural Society continue its support of the National Horticultural Council. </seg>

            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Other Activities The Society thru its Executive Board voted to delegate its secre - tary to attend the meetings of the American Cooperative Institute held at Columbus, Ohio, July 7th to 12th. A resume of the meetings was presented to the members of the Society in the August issue of the Midwest Fruitman which no doubt all members receive. An illustrated talk dealing with the other phases of this trip will be given on Thurs - day morning of this week. The Secretary was likewise delegated to attend the meetings of the Missouri River Horticultural Conference at Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 11th and 12th. A paper was read by him on the Cedar Rust Situation in Nebraska. The discussions that would probably be of most interest to us here in Nebraska were regarding codling moth control in the Kaw" Valley by Dr. Paul Gllmer of the U. S. D. A. and the one by Dr. E. C. Auchter also of the U. a D. A., on the Importance of Organic Matter in the Soil. Briefly stated the work of Dr. Gilmer at Wichita showed that three cover sprays for the first brood and two for the second at the rate of two pounds of lead arsenate to 50 gallons of water reduced the percentage of wormy apples to less than 10% where previously over 50% of the apples had worms in them. In fact the worms were so bad when the work was begun that even where six or seven regular applications were made for- the codling moth only a very small per cent of the apples were free from injury. Of course the spraying must be thoroughly done. His men used as high as 18 gallons per tree per spray. He found no particular advantage in the use of spreaders or oils. Dr. Auchter called attention to the fact that moisture is one of the most important elements in the growing of high grade apples. Several states have made surveys of orchards to find out why apples are culls. Spraying of course is necessary but since the perfection of modern spray outfits and timing of sprays insects and diseases are not responsible for the great majority of culls. About 50% of the culls are graded out because of lack of size and lack of color. Lack of size in many cases can be remedied by conserving moisture so the apple crop can get it and in non-irrigated sections this must be done by attention, to the organic material in the soil. If the soil is rich in organic material the nitrogen supply is generally sufficient to induce vigorous leaf growth. Leaves of course are essential in the produc - tion of fruit, in fact there should be present about 25 to 30 leaves for each apple. The organic matter in the soil helps likewise to con - serve moisture by its ability to absorb moisture and hold it for use by the tree's roots. Organic matter may be supplied by the applica - tion of manure or by the use of cover crops of legumes like red clover, vetch and* rye. Sometimes mixtures of leguminous and non-leguminous cover crops are used like vetch and rye. Of course other orchard </seg>
            <seg id="p496">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE practices like pruning and in some cases thinning must likewise, be resorted to In order to keep the cull pile as small as possible. How can you tell whether your orchard soil is lacking in humus? Here are some of the symptoms. In dry weather it will become baked and large cracks will appear on the surface. The soil will puddle when it rains, that is the soil particles will run together and such soil Is very difficult to handle. Furthermore lt'does not absorb water readily. A large proportion of the rainfall runs off and naturally there will be considerable erosion. But what is the effect on the trees? Usually the leaves are lacking in color and vigor. The bark may become hide bound. The fruit will be undersized and some var - ieties will have a tendency to crack. Especially is this true with staymen in the east. Another actlvlity that is being sponsored by the Society is home grounds beautification through yard and garden contests. To help out this move for a more beautiful Nebraska the Board voted to set aside $300 to be used as prizes for county contests, no county to re - ceive more than $30. Plants and garden equipment are to be given rather than the actual money. So far only two counties, namely Cass and Douglas, are contemplating such contests. But no doubt there will be others before the garden season begins. TREASURER'S REPORT DEARLE BAKER: You understand, of course, we have two sep - arate accounts. Practically all the expenses of the Nebraska Horti - cultural Society are met from state funds under the supervision of the State Board of Agriculture of which Mr. George Jackson is sec - retary. Our regular bills are presented to the Board of Agriculture and paid for out of this fund. Secretary Jackson's annual report .shows the amounts paid out of this fund and a complete record of these expenditures are found in his last annual report. The account that I have supervision of is the one that was handed down from the time when the Society was Independent of the Board of Agriculture. At. the beginning of the year 1930 it showed a bal - ance of $532.81 and the only money drawn out was for membership dues in the National Horticultural Council amounting to $25.00, leav - ing a balance of $507.81. MR. LORD: I move the adoption of this report. Motion seconded. Vote taken. Carried. C. A. LORD-: I move that the present officers all be re-elected. Motion duly seconded. . DARRELL. BAKER: I move as a substitute that the name of O. C. Stevenson be substituted for that of Mr. J. W. Steinhart for </seg>
            <seg id="p497">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Vice-President. Or I will make that as an amendment. Amendment duly seconded. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: Perhaps an explanation would be in order as to why that amendment is offered. Mr. Steinhart is quite a busy man, with his canning business at Nebraska City, and his right hand man has charge of the cherry orchards In that locality, and we thought it unfair to insist on Mr. Steinhart serving longer. He is very much interested in our work, but does not himself participate very much in actual horticultural work, while Mr. Stevenson does to a much greater extent and we have figured he might serve in the stead of Mr. Steinhart. You have heard the question and the amendment. We will first take up the amendment; all in favor of that signify by the usual sign, contrary No. The amendment having been carried, we revert to the original motion of Mr. Lord. Are there any further remarks? MR. HOPPERT: At the request of the President, I will call for a vote on the original motion. All in favor, say Aye. Contrary, No. The motion is carried. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: It almost looks like we are getting short of material if we have to re-elect the old officers. But as that is what you see- fit to do, we will do the best we can. I am sure I need a lot of able assistance and co-operation and I think we will, get it, for we have been having splendid co-operation — I believe better than in the past. DARRELL BAKER: I take it that this action carried with it the re-election of Mr. Christy to the Board. MR. HOPPERT: Yes, for a term of three years. His term was up this year and he is re-elected now for three years. We have com - pleted our program for this morning, and still have some time left. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: In the time we have left, there must be some questions you would like to bring up for discussion. C. A. LORD: I want to say something about apples. I have 300 trees that have never borne a profitable crop. They are now nineteen years old. They bear nice apples apparently, but they just start cracking, from the crown down to the stem, and pretty soon the old limbs are split oft entirely. A very large part of the soil In these orchards has not been cultivated for four or five years. But I don't see how any soil could be better for an orchard than we have there. These are Staymen Winesaps. I don't advise anybody to plant them around here. We have to wire them together and go over every tree. They are about the ornerlest kind to get to color. Furthermore the apples crack badly. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: If you want any information on that, we will refer you to Mr. Hoppert. </seg>
            <seg id="p498">. REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mil. HOPPEItT: Cracking of the fruit is rather common when hot dry periods are followed by favorable growing weather. Grapes cracked badly last year. The Wealthy, Genet and Staymen varieties of apples crack more than others. In the east It is claimed that soil with a deficiency of humus shows a greater tendency to produce cracked apples than soils rich in vegetative matter. Of course the Staymen tree is brittle but we find other varieties with hard wood cracking where there are bad crotches. This type of splitting can be avoided to a great extent by proper pruning early in the life of the tree. Coming back again to the splitting of the fruit we know that very hot dry weather causes the apple to produce a thicker tougher skin and when rains come followed 'by sunny weather the food ma - terial is forced into the apple so rapidly that the skin can't seeni to expand fast enough and it cracks. MR. LORD: In such an instance, there is no question but what the inside of the apple grows faster than the skin, and the skin must crack. MR. HOPPERT: You usually get that following very hot dry weather. MR. LORD: But I considered that we had practically ideal'condi - tions down there this last year. I fear you get it under all kinds of conditions. I think it is just the darned apples. MR. HOPPERT: We never have recommended Staymen for this section of the country. Back in Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey they may be a desirable apple. Even in Ohio, they think it a profitable variety to grow. A DELEGATE: The wood of the Staymen is very brittle. The trees break toadly when heavily loaded. There is a fine orchard at Shubert of Staymen about 16 years old. It hasn't had a profitable crop on it yet. They are just no good for this section, that is the way I see it. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: Are there any more questions? RICHARD KIMMEL: Awhile ago somebody mentioned vetch in the vineyard. How do you get rid of it? MR. HOPPERT: Discing the vineyard just before the plants bloom would prevent the vetch from going to seed, and discing in late summer will kill out most of the new seedlings, but of course such discing stimulates late growth and that is dangerous. I don't see any reason why an attempt should be made to get rid of it. Most of our soils need lots of humus to aid in holding water and to pre - vent soil erosion. . </seg>
            <seg id="p499">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY TUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: Will the meeting please come to order? Our first topic for discussion will be "The Spray Residue Problem." THE SPRAY PROBLEM W. H. HARTIGAN, Kansas City, Mo. W. H. HARTIGAN: Ladies and Gentlemen: Your secretary, Mr. Hoppert, has stated that at this meeting you will draw up plans for operation, covering the marketing of the apple crop during the fall of 1031, and that he believed this was an opportune time to inform you concerning the application of the Federal Food and Drugs Act to interstate shipments of apples. Also that any past experiences would serve as a .valuable guide for future operations by you. The arsenate of lead spray residue problem has come about as a result of the necessity of applying poisonous spray materials to fruit in an effort to control our insect pests. In killing our insect pests we use a spray material which leaves a residue on the fruit which if present in sufficient quantity, makes the fruit dangerous for gen - eral consumption from the standpoint of public health. The fact that the Federal Food and Drugs Act prohibits the marketing of fruit contaminated with excess residues is only incidental since we feel sure that the fruit industry itself even though there were no laws would recognize their responsibility in removing these resi - dues and provide their customers with fruit entirely safe from a public health standpoint. It is recognized that the growers of apples are entirely blameless in the situation which has developed. The necessity for spraying to control insect pests has been apparent for some years and the industry has become conscious of the fact that without spraying, a crop of fruit cannot be produced. Progressive agriculture as guided by various public agencies has been taught the doctrine of spraying for years and it has become one of the necessary operations in the commercial production of apples and pears. We have then before us the estab - lished fact that in order to grow fruit commercially in the light of competent agricultural practices it will contain at the time of harvest a residue poisonous in character. Our job is to remove this residue between the time of harvest and the time that the fruit reaches the consumer. We would have this problem even though tbere were no pure food laws. However, since there is such a law, I might just as well tell you about its requirements at the outset. In the first place, the Federal law applies only to interstate shipments, although most of the states are active in enforcing their own statutes of a similar character and many city health agencies enforce ordinances to the same end. The Federal Food and Drugs Act classes as adulterated any article of food that contains any added poisonous or other added deleterious </seg>
            <seg id="p500">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ingredient which may render such articles injurious to health, and it closes the channels of interstate commerce to adulterated foods. The law provides not only for the seizure of offending food, but for the prosecution in the Federal courts of the shipper. Apples containing residues of a poisonous character such as lead arsenate fall directly in the class of foods containing added deleterious or poisonous sub - stances. On this statute is based the authority under which the Department of Agriculture exercises a control over excess spray residues. Regardless of the sympathetic feeling that the Department of Agriculture has towards your industry, the Pure Pood Law places on it a responsibility to the consumer of foods which is inescapable' and which leaves it with, no alternative other than to achieve the most effective enforcement of the Pure Food Law possible with the funds and personnel provided by the Congress of the United States. The Department of Agriculture has no desire to evade the direct mandate of the law and our course from the beginning has been charted with the ultimate idea of effecting a complete enforcement at the earliest practical time. It so happened that a program of. sympathetic educa - tional effort combined with an appeal for cooperation with the apple industry and the application of formal regulatory effort when neces - sary, gave promise of achieving our ultimate end quicker and more effectively than any other method, of enforcement. In other words, our purpose has been to follow a course of action which would insure to the American people the greatest degree of protection available under the terms of the law. At this time let me refer you to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the bleached flour case to give you that court's interpretation of the law as it applies to added poisonous in - gredients. In this decision the Supreme Court states as follows: Supreme Court Decision "It is not required that the article of food containing added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredients must affect the public health, and it is not incumbent upon the Government, in order to make out a case, to establish that fact. The act has placed upon the Government the burden of establishing, in order to secure a verdict of condemnation under this statute, that the .added poisonous or deleterious substances must be such as may render such article injurious to health. It may be consumed, when prepared as a food, by the strong and the weak, the old and the young, the well and the sick; and it is intended that if any flour, because of any added poisonous or other deleterious ingredient, may pos - sibly injure the health of any of these, it shall come within the ban of the statute." Toxicity of Arsenic and Li-ml Let us consider at this time the poisonous properties of arsenic and lead. Both are recognized by toxicologists as accumulative poisons. When minute amounts are repeatedly taken into the human </seg>
            <seg id="p501">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY system, they are not eliminated by the ordinary digestive functions of the body, but they accumulate in the system until they are present in sufficient quantity to cause profound physiological effects. In the quantity that lead arsenate occurs as a spray residue we do not ex - pect it to act as an acute poison. We do not expect the victim to die or even be made violently ill. The effect which we have to guard against is that of chronic poisoning, or the gradual accumulation in the system of enough poison to produce the effects of lead and arsenic poison. These effects may be slow in development and may not be easy to recognize by the medical practitioner who may overlook en - tirely the causel factor in such cases and attribute sickness to condi - tions entirely distinct from the actual cause. The insidious and latent manifestations of this type of poisoning makes it difficult of recogni - tion and, therefore, liable to go on until serious injury may result. The small quantities consumed may simply cause symptoms of gastro - intestinal disturbances, headaches, and other minor manifestations of disease. The cumulative effects of these poisonings, however, are serious and must be avoided. . Keep in mind, too, that there are differences in the amount of poison which different individuals can tolerate, also that our apples are eaten by the young and the ol'd, the sick and the well, and that they must be made safe for any and all regardless of individual idio - ' syncrasies. Tolerance The Department of Agriculture has established a policy of grad - ually reducing the tolerance for arsenic until we reach the world tolerance of .010 grain per pound. Last season the tolerance was 0.015 grain per pound. We do not know at this time what the tol - erance will be for next year. However, we can tell you that it will be 0.01 just as soon as the industry as a whole in the United States with diligence is able to meet the world tolerance. Until the Depart - ment is able to disgest the data accumulated during the past season and until they have time to consult with the industry, it will be im - possible to announce a tolerance which will control during the next season. Even if the world tolerance of 0.01 is in effect next season it is believed advisable to make arrangements to meet the World tol - rance effective next season. This will give the orchardists a much more advantageous position when the tolerance does actually reach the world figure and would have the effect of producing fruit of un - assailable character. It seems reasonable that many growers will of necessity thru a proper insect control have to harvest their fruit with an excess of spray residue. This, then, leaves us to consider the means available for removal of this residue before the product is marketed. </seg>
            <seg id="p502">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE .Methods of Itemoving Spray Residue The industry has made considerable progress in the introduction of methods which will eventually give us complete freedom from ex - cess residues on market fruit. Reference is made to the growing practice of washing apples and pears with dilute hydrochloric acid prior to packing. We have information that approximately 80% of the shippers in the large production areas in the west have installed suitable washing machinery and, we are glad to say, that rapid pro - gress is being made in that direction in the central west. Last season 38 washing machines were in operation in the central west. Several of these machines were located in the state of Nebraska. We believe that next season will see this number increased until Nebraska will have available sufficient equipment for properly cleaning the entire output. From past experiences we are lead to believe that the only safe plan is to wash your fruit with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid to be followed by a thoro rinsing. Some growers have tried to reduce the residue by cutting down on the amount of lead arsenate in the spray material, or by the substitution of other substances for lead arsenate. Entomologists have been working diligently in an effort ' to find useful sprays for the insects which you have to fight other than lead arsenate. So far lead arsenate seems to be the only effect - ive remedy available. Experiences in the northwest have demonstrated that apples and pears sprayed more than three times with lead in concentrations of not over two and one-half pounds per 100 gallons, will actually require a washing treatment in order to consistently meet the world tolerance for arsenate. In some sections of the middle west, a reduction of the amount of lead arsenate applied either 'by reducing the concentration or the number of applications, have resulted in failure to control insect pests, even though the arsenic on the fruit at harvest was under the tolerance. Apparently we must use sufficient lead arsenate to control the pests and remove the excess from the fruit after harvest. There - fore use the amount according to the schedule which your entomologist believes necessary to control the pests but remove it before the fruit is shipped. Attempts have been made to clean the fruit by use of various types of dry cleaning apparatus such as, brushing machines, wiping machines, etc. Experience has shown that the use of dry cleaning methods will not consistently remove excess residue where the quan - tity originally on the fruit is reasonably high. Reference is made to the Bureau of Plant Industry Circular No. 59, which says: "The average efficiency obtained for all varieties- of apples with the four typical dry cleaning methods under observation range from 15 to 35%. This fact indicates that dry cleaning as a rule will not be satisfactory for apples having an original residue content above .015 of a grain per pound even when there are no conflicting factors involved in the </seg>
            <seg id="p503">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY cleaning." Our experience confirms this statement. We have examined during the past season, seven duplicate samples before and after wip - ing in various types of ■ wiping machines. The average reduction in arsenic on these seven samples amounted to 30%. The range In arsenic before wiping was from 0.029 to 0.009, the range after wiping was from 0.023 to 0.007. My conclusions are that attempts to control either by artificially restricting our spray schedules below that recom - mended by our entomologists or by wiping our fruit are likely to be non-effective. Economic Factors Involved Aside from the public health factors involved consideration should be given to the economic factors in connection with the washing of apples. We are convinced that apples will sell better in the long run and will be more attractive to the consumer if they are put thru suitable washers prior to marketing. There are some growers in the west who have had considerable experience with washing fruit, who now state that even though there were no problems of spray residue removal they would not abandon the practice of washing their out - put. From the standpoint of the consumer a washed apple is superior to one which has not been washed because the consumer has come to regard cleanliness of his food supply as of supreme importance. The consumer generally, has little knowledge that apples are sprayed with a poisonous material and as yet he has had no opportunity to demand washed apples. We feel that this condition will not always prevail and the time may come when the consumer will demand washed apples both from the standpoint of cleanliness and further for the safety implied by the washing process. In some sections the consumer is already beginning to ask about the fate of the poisons he knows are being applied to the fruits he buys. When this condition arises those of us who are prepared to wash our fruit will be placed in a decidedly favorable economic situation. Already some apple packers are labeling washed fruit to distinguish it from the fruit that has not been so treated. It is only one step from that to his insistent common demand for washed fruit. When a consumer once observes a box labeled "Washed Apples" don't you think that from then on he is going to be suspicious of any fruit not bearing this reassuring label and is going to demand fruit that in fact he knows to be safe? It is our job to be able to meet this consumer's demand when it arises. Acid Wash Method Taking as a guide our past experiences we- find the acid wash method as the most effective for the adequate removal of residues from our fruit. Home made washing machines have been used in some districts for washing apples and pears and are particularly adapted to the grower who has a small crop and packs approximately a carload or less per day. Two types of equipment that can be easily and cheaply made are described in a pamphlet by the Bureau of Plant </seg>
            <seg id="p504">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mausiry. We have a small supply of these pamphlets for distribution to any persons who are interested in home made washing machines or the methods which are given. There are on the market several types of commercially manufactured machines costing considerable more than the home made variety but having a larger capacity. Many growers have analyses made of samples taken from their orchards prior to packing and use a washer only if the analyses show high results. Unless the sampling of the orchard is done with ex - treme care and large samples collected of a thoro representative char - acter, results are likely to be misleading. A small number of apples taken from an orchard at random may give results higher than the fruit when packed. We also have examples where the results have been much lower. Therefore, unless orchard samples are carefully taken from a large number of trees, and the results interpreted with considerable care they are likely to be misleading. Too much con - fidence cannot be placed upon rain as an agent for the removal of residues while the fruit is on the trees. Rain and other weathering influences do reduce the amount of residue somewhat, but incomplete data in our flies indicates that rain of itself has little influence in reducing the amount of the residue. This logically follows since spray materials are insoluble in water and to be most effective they should adhere closely to the fruit. There is an apparent reduction which is probably due to growth and weathering independent of rain. There - fore we reach the conclusion that a hard rain a few days before pick - ing should not prevent the progressive grower from putting his fruit thru a washing machine. The entomologists of the department say that the addition of lime or the use of Bordeau Mixture in the later sprays to facilitate residue removal at harvest time cannot be universally recommended at present. This practice does make satisfactory fruit washing more easily done than when hydrochloric acid solvent is used, and may re - duce the arsenic injury that sometimes occurs in fruit districts owing to the formation of water-soluble arsenic on the fruit after the early rains. However, there is evidence in a number of sections that the use of hydrated lime in this. way may reduce the codling moth control. When heavier types of mineral oil sprays are applied with or after heavy applications of lead arsenate, the combined residues gen - erally interferes with fruit cleaning by either the dry or the solvent methods. Proper use of the lighter type of mineral oil with lead arsenate while often making fruit washing slightly more difficult, has generally not resulted in preventing the fruit from being cleaned to the world tolerance when it was done with efficient equipment and sufficient solvent in the washing solution. The strength of acid in the machine should be closely watched. Unless it is kept up to strength it will not remove the residue effect - ively. For example we ran a lot of apples thru a commercial washer using clear water only in the acid tank, even tho in this machine there </seg>

The most satisfactory results are obtained when the fruit is dried before packing, but no serious difficulties have re - sulted from the presence of small amounts of moisture on the fruit. When the removal of the residue has been thoro and rinsing adequate no injury has occurred that can be attributed to the action of the water. Fruit packed with traces of moisture has dried quite readily both in cold and common storage provided the humidity has not been above 85°. The following relate to some of our experiences in the operation of washing machines in the central west. We made duplicate analyses of 42 lots of apples before and after passing thru the washing process. This work was done on ail types of machines ranging from the moat elaborate commercial affair to a simple arrangement for dipping as used in some of our. big cities for reconditioning apples which have •been sized. The average reduction of arsenic amounted to 80%. The average amount of arsenic on the apples before washing was 0.020 grains per lb.; after washing 0.004. The range before washing was from 0.040 to 0.002. The range after washing was from 0.019 to only a trace. One single result was higher than the present domestic tol - erance. This was believed due to the improper use in some way of one particular machine. However, it may have been due to any number of factors. Therefore, we believe that any process which is effective among a great number of operators, many of whom were inexperienced which yields effective results 41 times out of 42 must be good. Two other samples contained 0.12 and 0.13 grains per lb. after washing. 39 of the 42 samples complied with the world . tolerance. Policy of the Food and Drug Administration for Next Year In conclusion let me give you an outline as to the policy of the Food and Drug Administration for next year. We expect to continue operations in the production areas. We will send our inspectors and chemistB into the field for the purpose of locating lots of apples which fail to comply with the requirements. If these apples are not cleaned before they are shipped in interstate commerce we expect to take action on them when they reach their destination. The work in the areas of production will be supplemented by the sampling of cars and truck loads of apples moving in interstate commerce at destina - tion, and if excess residues are found, action will be taken under the Food and Drugs Act. Cooperation from States and Cities As indicative of the policy which will control among state and city officials, the association of Food, Dairy and Drug Officials of the United States, recently in their New Orleans meeting adopted a reso - lution outlining a program for controlling this situation which called for concerted action by individual state and city organizations to elim - inate from the market all fruit showing excess residues.

Please let me express niy appreciation for having had the op - portunity of appearing before your Association. Now, if there are any questions you wish to ask, I will be glad to try and answer them. I know you can fire questions at me that per - haps I cannot answer and never would be able to answer, but I will ■ try at least. I have followed this work twenty-five years, but you may be able to stump me. But Mr. Hoppert or somebody here may be able to help out. MR. BAKER: What were your findings on samples taken through southeast Nebraska, if you care to divulge? MR. HARTIGAN: I can perhaps look them up. I can give you something for Nebraska, I'd hardly want to give them here individ - ually. Is that what you want? MR. BAKER: I just wanted to get an idea of how the samples you had taken ran on residue. MR. HARTIGAN: Do you remember when — along about what time, those were taken? MR. BAKER: I believe it was along about the middle of October. MR. HARTIGAN: I don't know as I can give you much informa - tion on that. Here are four samples taken in southeast Nebraska, .0124, .0108, .0107, .0109. I don't want to tell you John had this, or Jim had that. These things bring sad memories. I know of a case of a fellow who started a carload out of Colorado to Princeton, Missouri. We took samples that ran .019 on that car. We told him .he would have to wash his apples and he said, "My God, wash those apples," he had never heard of such a thing. He said, "How would you wash apples in shipment? You can't take them to .a laundry. I don't know how to wash apples." We told him what had to be done and how to do it. We had a hard time convincing him, however. MR. BAKER: Will your department notify these different grow - ers having samples, of your findings, so they will know how their apples are running? Will you tell them the result of your tests? MR. HARTIGAN: We would do that for you folks simply as a matter of information for you. That isn't exactly a part of our work. We realize why you might want to know. We can take original sam - ples from the orchard and run them about as easy as samples from a carload of apples. We can and will do that for your information. That really isn't a part of our work. We have indulged in it some in the last four or five years. Another problem that is presenting Itself now is the trucks. You were talking this morning about the increase in truck shipments. </seg>
            <seg id="p507">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY They need inspection and testing just the same as carload shipuicuia. I could give some interesting experiences we have had with trucks loaded with apples to be taken from one state to another, especially from southern Kansas into Oklahoma. REPORT OF COMMITTEE OX SPRAY RESIDUES ASSOCIATION FOOD AND DRUG OFFICIALS Association of Food Officials, New Orleans, La. Lead and arsenic are both recognized by toxicologists as cumula - tive poisons. In the quantity ordinarily found on fruits and vegetables, the effect of these poisons is not usually acute in character. Their danger lies in the chronic cumulative effect when taken into the sys - tem in even the smallest amount over long periods of time. Your committee feels that the members of this organization in- their several official capacities, have a direct responsibility to the American public in preventing the consumption of sprayed fruit and vegetables bearing residues which may produce chronic poisoning. We have been confronted with this problem for the past several years and your committee is now submitting a progress report out - lining the basis of a uniform method of inspection for apples and pears. It is recognized that certain other fruit and vegetables notably grapes, currants, and celery have been found to contain excessive residues, but we are not ready, at this time, to propose uniform meth - ods on substances other than apples and pears. Due to the ravages of the Codling Moth and other insect pests, the problem is more acute on apples and pears than with other substances. When this problem first arose several years ago, it was most acute in the western states. With the gradual lowering of the tol - erance and possibly with the spread of insect infestation the problems of spray residue removal have rapidly moved eastward until at the present time the control of residues on apples and pears constitutes one of the most pressing problems of the food and drug officials in the entire United States. Beginning in the west, the use of suitable cleansing methods have been adopted by the industry. These methods are now necessary in most of the states producing commercial crops of apples and pears. Control has been attempted with indifferent success by limiting the number of applications and quantity of arsenate of lead. Except in a very few areas having only mild infestation this method of con - trol has proved inadequate and in some instances has resulted in the loss of fruit through the ravages of insect pests. • Dry cleaning by means of rotating brushes, hand wiping, etc., has been tried, but these methods can not be expected to remove more </seg>
            <seg id="p508">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE than 15 to 35% of the residue. Moreover, in some instances where brushing and wiping is not very closely controlled, little or no residue will be removed and, in fact, the amount may be increased by con - tamination with the brushes or .wiping rags. Experimental work by the United States Department of Agricul - ture and State agencies, confirmed by commercial experience, has demonstrated that the methods of cleaning based on treatment of the fruit with dilute hydrchloric acid, are effective in removing spray resi - dues, and such treatment when properly controlled does not injure the appearance or keeping qualities of apples and pears. The committee believes that producers of apples and pears should be urged not to depend on restricted spray schedules or dry cleaning methods, but should use some type of acid wash to insure the marketing of clean fruit. Educational work now in progress under the direction of State and Federal regulatory agencies, experiment stations, State and Fed - eral service agencies, and the organized industry should be encour - aged and the efforts of all agencies engaged in educational work co - ordinated to the end that the individuals in the industry may become entirely familiar with the necessity for spray residue removal and the method used in its accomplishment. For the past five years all of these agencies have been at work on educational programs and such progress has been made that the vast majority of commercial apple and pear growers and shippers are familiar with methods of adequate control. Acid washing of apples and pears has become a recognized necessity in the preparation of fruit for the market in many sections of the United States. Acid washers are in operation in practically every production area, but in many areas facilities are available for cleaning only a small proportion .of the commercial output. Educational work should continue toward the introduction in all areas of sufficient acid washing apparatus to properly clean all apples and pears having an excess of arsenate of lead at the time of harvest. Progress has been made in educational work to the point where regulatory action should be taken against all shipments of apples and pears bearing excess residues which, in any way, are consumed by the American people. State control officials are urged to establish field laboratories in the areas of production during the harvest season for the twofold pur - pose of informing growers of excess residues on their fruit and com - pelling them to remove the excess residues before shipments enter either interstate or intrastate commerce. Numerous samples from orchards should be collected and where legal authority exists, the fruit on the trees containing excess arsenic should be embargoed pend - ing the application of suitable cleaning methods. These laboratories should also examine fruit from packing sheds, loading stations, trucks, etc., and any lots found containing excess residues, where legal auth - ority exists, should be embargoed on the spot until properly cleaned. </seg>
            <seg id="p509">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY A large part of the apple and pear production moves from the producing areas to suitable storage 'warehouses where it is held until finally marketed. All state agencies should undertake surveys of cold Storage warehouses to locate high residue fruit which should be em - bargoed until properly cleaned. In the consuming areas, the state agencies should establish patrols coordinated with their field laborator - ies to locate any lots of fruit which might be missed in the producing area for the purpose of analysis and suitable action taken should ex - cess residues be found. In spite of the most effective control in the areas of production, some lots of fruit will find their way to the markets in the cities and should be controlled by appropriate municipal health officials in cooperation with State and Federal agencies. Patrols of fruit markets to locate lota of fruit showing high residues should be established and such, when found, should be either destroyed or the owner com - pelled to clean by suitable methods. In its final analysis, this problem is one which has an intimate bearing on the public health and the consumption of fruits containing excess residues is- a distinct menace to the public health. Therefore, the health official is directly con - cerned and his efforts constltue the last effective barrier between the consumer and the consumption of food contaminated with arsenic and lead. Jurisdiction under the Federal Food and Drugs Act is obtained only after passage of a commodity in interstate commerce. The Fed - eral Government should participate in the work of State agencies in the producing areas for the purpose of locating any interstate move - ment of illegal fruit and should Institute suitable action at destination on any lots moving in interstate commerce bearing excess residues. Federal agencies should patrol large receiving centers, storage ware - houses, and other concentration points for the purpose of instituting suitable action on any fruit located which has moved in interstate commerce and which contains excess residues. The Committee recommends that as soon as possible conferences be held between State, City and Federal agencies in each area of production to map out a plan of action governing control measures for the next year. On account of differences in organization, laws, and ordinances, somewhat different methods of approach will be re - quired in different states, but a thorough understanding should be arrived at by the different agencies engaged in this work as to the part that each is to play in control measures Instituted for the next producing season. Educational work should get underway at the winter meetings of horticultural societies and other gatherings of the producers and interested trade elements. The industry has gone a long way toward meeting the situation created by the necessity of using quantities of spray materials in com - bating insect pests. They have shown a spirit of cooperation that Is commendable and they have demonstrated a spirit which deserves </seg>
            <seg id="p510">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE recognition on the part of food officials. In every instance, the industry should be taken into the confidence of control officials and their aid enlisted in meeting the situation. Many elements of tlie Industry have prepared themselves through the use of suitable cleansing machinery to produce fruit complying with all standards. Washing machines are rapidly being installed and In another year we hope that the major part of the Industry will be in a position to meet the standard. These men in the industry who have, prepared themselves to meet the situa - tion deserve protection against those shortsighted elements in the in - dustry who are not preparing to clean their fruit and all official agen - cies will be called on to accord this protection. While we as food officials are conscious of the economic factors involved in this situation, .we must not lose sight of the fact that it is primarily a public health measure and that the American public must be provided with fruit and vegetables which are free from the danger of excess residues of poisonous material. The Committee recommends that effective with next year's crop, the tolerance for arsenic be reduced to the world tolerance of 0.01 grains per pound (1.4 milligrams per kilo). The committee further recommends for future study, by the Spray Residue Committee: 1. Study methods of sampling. (a) Commercial lots of apples and pears. (b) Orchard samples. . (c) Relation between apparent and actual residue. 2. Influence of rainfall and other natural causes in the reduc - tion of spray residue. ■ 3. Correlation of time, method and quantity of spray applica - tions with residue. 4. Variation of washing methods to meet different types of sprays. (Signed) SPRAY RESIDUE COMMITTEE. MR. HOPPERT: You folks might be Interested in hearing from Mr. Yocum on the work being done here at the College. MR. YOCUM: I hardly know,' gentlemen, where to begin in say^ ing something about this spraying work. We carry on such work here and perhaps we take it for granted that the public know what we are doing. I might say a little for the benefit of those not familiar with our operations and our work here at the college along this line. During the past five years the College has been doing experi - mental work and carrying on such operations to improve our control in this work. During that time we have tested various kinds of sprays. We have found dust sprays as mainly supplemental to the standard liquid sprays. We find the growers must vary the methods, according .to </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY their own local conditions. We have also been testing oil sprays 10 see if we could get away from the spray residue, and help some of the small growers when it comes to the washing. THE 1O8O SPRAY EXPERIMENTS AT SHl'BERT By W. W. YOCUM The past season was the third season devoted to a test of summer oil sprays for controlling codling moth. The past summer proved a severe test for summer oils. In fact it was a severe test of our spray schedule in general, for the drouth which began about July 1st was favorable to the codling moth and there was little rain to wash off the spray materials. There was a well developed second brood of worms and a partial third brood. In spite of these unfavorable con - ditions we got very good control of the worms in the young orchard. In the old orchard where the infestation was heavier another spray should have been applied for the 3rd brood of worms. But it was not applied, for fear of an excess of residue. In the young orchard, con - trol was so thoro and uniform in all the plats that It is Impossible to draw any conclusions except that summer oils proved practically as efficient as lead arsenate In controlling second brood worms. Analyses for arsenical spray residue do show decided differences in the amounts of residue resulting from the different spray schedules. There is just one explanation which should be made before com - menting on these results. The method of gathering apples for the arsenical test differed slightly this year from the method used the past two years. The past two years an attempt was made to choose a rep - resentative sample from each spray plat. But during the past year it was learned that the government agents choose the apples with the heaviest covering of spray residue for analysis, hence these were chosen as samples this year. However, in all three years the samples were gathered from the apples within reach from the ground, so the differences in sampling should not be so great. The large amount of residue found on all this fruit this year was quite a surprise. In the young orchard 11 out of 16 analysis were under the tolerated amount but 5 were over the limit of .015 grains of AS,Oi per pound of fruit which was the standard last year. Seven out of the 16 did not go over the world tolerance of .01 grain of AS,O, while 9 did. In the old orchard where one more spray was applied than in the young orchard, the results do not sound as good as in the young orchard. Here only two plats kept under the 1930 tolerance and but' one was down to the world tolerance. </seg>
            <seg id="p512">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is hard to explain these differences in residue from the spray schedules followed. Much the same plan of experiment was followed this year as has been followed the past two years. Everyone must realize the importance of the weather in the resi - due situation. In July, 1930, the eastern third of the state had the lightest rainfall ever recorded. In August there was about one-third more than the normal rainfall, but in September the precipitation averaged about half of normal in this southeast section. This season shows that an unusually heavy deposit of lead arsenate may be ex - pected when the rainfall is much below normal during the summer months. Oil sprays are used primarily to get away from the use of so much lead arsenate and to avoid a heavy residue being deposited on the fruit. Since oils cannot be used with lead arsenate they are not used until the second brood develops. If the rainfall has been normal up to this time so a large part of the lead arsenate spray has been washed off, then the use of oil holds down the residue. However, if the rainfall has been light as it was in 1930 and a heavy deposit of lead arsenate is on the trees at the time oils are applied, then the oil holds the lead arsenate more strongly and it is less apt to weather off. In such cases an unusually heavy lead arsenate residue may be on the fruit at harvest time. Just that situation was reported from Illinois and Missouri the past season. In order to get a more general opinion regarding the value of summer oil sprays, several experiment stations in this section and commercial growers in the Middle West who have given oils a trial, were written for their opinion. Of all persons canvassed the general opinion was that lead ar - senate should be used for first brood control entirely. For the 2nd and 3rd brood worms, oils gave nearly as good control of worms as lead arsenate. The oil is more expensive than lead arsenate, but usually a little cheaper when the cost of washing the fruit is con - sidered. However, the use of summer oil does not always get away from the spray residue problem. During a long protracted drought period as occurred the past summer, the late oil sprays may hold enough arsenic from the first brood sprays to require washing. W. P. Flint, Chief Entomologist at Urbana, 111., summarized his work as follows: "Our work with the summer oils and the results of same taken in the orchards of some 62 of our commercial growers seem to show that the summer oil emulsions may be depended upon to control codling moth nearly as well as arsenate of lead where the oils are used for the control of 2nd and 3rd brood worms. This data is based on our 4 years work with these oils and the data from the 62 orchards was taken this year. We have not found it practical to use oils for the first brood codling moth control. The expense of </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY spraying with the summer oils is greater than that of spraying with arsenate of lead but usually a little less than spraying with arsenate of lead and washing." . • "This year analyses of nearly twenty lots of oil sprayed apples, that is, where arsenate of lead was used for first brood control and oil for the control of the second brood showed that the residue did not go over the Federal Tolerance. In apples sprayed throughout the season with arsenate of lead approximately AW/ r went over the Fed - eral tolerance this year." Prof. T. J. Talbert, Chairman of the Horticulture Department, at the University of Missouri, wrote of their use of summer oils as follows: 1. "We do not get away from the spray residue problem, as in - vestigations this year with four applications of summer oils applied late in the season as against four applications of arsenate of lead ap - plied at the same time showed when chemical analyses were finished that the. fruit on the oil-sprayed trees contained from three to four times as much arsenic as the fruit on the arsenic sprayed trees. 2. In general too much injury to both fruit and foliage results to make summer oils practical for the commercial grower. This oc - curs on both foliage and fruit, the severity depending upon weather conditions and the variety; but in nearly all cases the injury is too severe to justify the use of oils. 3. The expense of. summer oils is considerably greater than that for arsenate of lead." It might be explained that in Missouri and other states to the south, summer oils cause considerable damage by burning the leaves and fruit. This seems to be due to the higher temperatures and higher humidity. Such damage from oils has not been experienced in Ne - braska. In some cases where oils were used without calcium caseinate spreader, it has had a peculiar spotting effect on the fruit due to uneven development of color. Where the oil gathered in drops on the apples the red color did not develop normally, causing a blotched appearance. Slight russetting of the fruit seemed due to oil also. J. J. Davis, Chief Entomologist of Purdue University of Indiana, states that they have found summer oil sprays about as efficient as lead arsenate for 2nd and 3rd brood worms. That station is not recommending their use, however, for, they have gotten some injury from the oil. He reminds us that the season was unusually favorable for spray injury and that the oil should not be judged too severely on that score. He says that the use of summer oils as a substitute for L. S. certainly will eliminate the residue situation. J. S. Houser, Chief of the Department of Entomology of Ohio Experiment Station, summarizes his work thus: "We feel that under present conditions the large commercial orchardist had best continue for his late season applications with arsenate of lead and if harmful </seg>
            <seg id="p514">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE residues are present at picking time he should prepare to wash hla fruit. The smaller orchardist, however, who cannot afford to put in a washing machine may have considerable use for the late season oil sprays, particularly if by using them he is able to avoid washing the fruit." J. H. Allison, County Farm Adviser of Calhoun County, Illinois, in answer to my inquiry wrote the following: "We used around two carloads of this material the past season but as near as can be de - termined it was not quite as good as lead arsenate in the control of codling moth. We had some growers that had excellent results while others would not use the oil again if it Was given them as a present. We feel that there is a place on the program for the oil spray where the grower is isolated in such a manner that it would not be practical to wash his fruit." Mr. L. M. Smith, of Ozark, Illinois, used summer oil on about 65 acres of apples last summer, two applications for the 2nd and one for the 3rd brood. He writes, "Our results were a little disappointing because we had such a lot of wormy apples, but apparently our. apples were not much if any worse than others who used lead. I had samples of my apples tested for residue and all were quite a bit under the world tolerance. We may decide to use lead and wash our fruit but the method of washing and the best machine to use is uncertain just now. I feel that it is a good time to give the summer oil a thorough test." In summarizing the situation with summer oils it seems that the operator of a large orchard should continue to use lead arsenate throughout the season, as often and as late as may be necessary to control the worm. If the arsenical residue goes over the tolerated amount he should plan to wash his fruit. The small grower who feels that he cannot afford a washer will find late oil sprays a help in hold - ing down the residue in most seasons. FRUIT CLEANING EQUIPMENT — PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE By H. G. INGERSON, Lansing. Michigan In' Charge of Extension John Bean Mfg. Co. The history of fruit cleaning equipment • goes back for many years, as citrus fruits have been both washed and polished for a long time. The cleaning of apples, pears and peaches, Is of more recent development and naturally, the early types of equipment for this pur - pose were adaptations of citrus equipment. Different types of brush cleaners and polishers were used in California and the Pacific North - west on apples as early as 1923, and this type of equipment came into very general use in those sections in 1925 and '26. </seg>
            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY At that time the domestic tolerance on spray residue was .uzvb. This was reduced materially in 1926 and the new tolerance established brought dismay to the Northwest apple growers when tests showed that the dry type of cleaners in many cases, failed to bring the fruit under the new tolerance. Naturally, the next step was to try moisten - ing the fruit and when water alone proved inadequate, chemicals of different natures were added. These included soap, alkalies, and acids, in fact a whole list of materials that might prove beneficial were tried. During the 1926 season, the practice of using dilute hydro - chloric acid was quite well established in the Northwest districts. The tests were made with small improvised units of equipment, either adopted from citrus washing or improvised locally. The early attempts at washing included the immersion type of washers, whereby the fruit was carried through some kind of a vat, either loose or in orchard containers, and some of this fruit was im - mersed to a depth of 10 to 12 Inches. By leaving the fruit in the solution several minutes and then removing, and in turn immersing in clear water, the residue was usually reduced to the government tolerance. When the fruit was put into storage and later on the market, many cases of fruit injury were found. This took several forms, such as blackening at the core, due to the deep submersion of the fruit, actual burn on the skin and flesh of the fruit, the typical arsenical burn about the calyx end where rinsing had been Inadequate. These were some of the difficulties encountered the first year. At this time manufacturers of fruit handling equipment became actively interested in helping solve the problem of removing this spray residue. It was realized that the Northwest apple industry hung in the balance and all of the industries dependent on profitable produc - tion of apples in these districts were naturally concerned about their business. The best engineering skill together with the chemists, fruit packers and sales agencies, worked together to develop equipment suit - able for the requirements of their districts. The season of 1927 brought a somewhat Improved condition with improved types of wash - ing equipment, using the so-called flood wash, and the diffused spray wash. Better provision was made for rinsing, and dryers were pro - vided as definite parts of the washing equipment for the first time. Previously the fruit had to set In the packing house a day or more for the rinse water to dry off before the fruit could be graded and packed. ' You will see that in two seasons, considerable progress was made in the development of washing equipment. In 1927 the first commercial apple washers were introduced into the east in southern New Jersey. That particular section has an un - usual codling moth population, and extra cover sprays were applied. This same year of 1927, the dry type of cleaning equipment by brushes and cloth wipers was introduced in the -east and installed in considerable numbers in some of the eastern sections, particularly the Shenandoah-Cumberland section of Virginia and the adjoining </seg>
            <seg id="p516">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE states of Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. With the lighter spray schedules of the east and application of less amounts of material per tree, this type of cleaning equipment was sufficient for most re - quirements. Additional units of these dry cleaners and polishers were installed in the east in the seasons of '28 and '29. Likewise, additional installations of commercial washers were made in these years at widely separated points. The seasons of 1928 and '29 saw many additional Improvements in washing equipment made in the northwest, and prac - tically a uniform adoption of the washing method of spray residue removal. The dry type of cleaning equipment formerly used was usually installed between the washer and grader, and served both as a drying and polishing unit. With the beginning of the 1930 season, indications were that the enforcement officials of the United States Food and Drugs division would reduce the domestic spray residue tolerance. The official order on this change was issued in April, 1930, and this brought the spray residue matter squarely before the eastern growers. Fortunately, there were enough installations of washing equipment at different points in the east to demonstrate the adaptability of the process and the equipment to eastern conditions. As a rule, residues were not as heavy as in the northwest, but the fruit was smaller and was packed thru a longer season. Michigan had had the experience of having several cars of fruit rejected in the winter of 1929-30 and the co-operative packing houses of the western part of the state took steps early in the season to equip for washing. Practically all of these co-operative houses installed equipment to handle at least part of their volume, and in some cases all fruit pass - ing thru the house was washed, regardless of the spray schedule or amount of residue on the fruit. Southern Illinois had fruit rejected when they began to pack and ship Transparent and Duchess in July of 1930. Several washers were installed in this section and some quantity of fruit washed in the 1930 season. The Shenandoah-Cum - berland section of Virginia depends on the export market for their smaller sizes of several varieties of fruit, and practically, all of their Albemarle Pippins go to the British Isles. All fruit going abroad must meet the International tolerance of .01, and in August it was realized that residues were heavy and that the dry type of cleaning would not be sufficient in all cases. A considerable number of commercial washers was ordered and installed in the larger packing houses of this section. A majority of the fruit in the Virginia section was washed before packing in 1930. The washers that have been used in the east have been of the flood type and the diffused spray type. In both of these, the apples were not immersed in solution, but the solution pumped on to the fruit in considerable volume. Several years' use of these principles has shown that when properly used, there is absolutely no injury to the fruit, either mechanical or chemical, and that there is a much </seg>
            <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY improved appearance with the removal of all residues as well as sur - face' dust and dirt. The removal of the other materials than spray residues is of almost equal importance, as far too much eastern fruit has gone on the market with accumulation of road dust, packing house dust and varying amounts of the black fungus following aphis infestation and in some seasons, the specking following leaf hopper infestation. This last blemish was serious in certain sections of the east this past sea - son'and one large orchard operating company installed washers in all their packing houses more for the removal of the leaf hopper blemish than any other factor. By doing this they moved thirty per cent more of their crop into "A" grade and paid for their washing equipment the first season. These different materials that cause grad - ing down of quality are all satisfactorily removed in the present type of washing equipment, if care is given the washing and drying process. The dryers are an important part of the washing equipment as they put the fruit in condition so that the sorters and packers can handle it without discomfort. Efficient dryers have been as difficult to devise as the washers and two common types are in use. The one depends on very strong blast of air actually blowing the drops of water from the fruit. The other uses absorbent towels to remove the surplus rinse water. These towels are dried by running thru a wringer similar to a clothes wringer only much longer. Before the dryers were perfected serious delays occurred in the packing house while the fruit was standing for the rinse water to drain off. We find as we attend the different state meetings, that the ques - tion in the mind of many growers is how this equipment can be in - stalled in their present packing houses and used with their present equipment. If water is available, the problem is comparatively sim - ple. The washers are simply placed ahead of the grader and the fruit passes automatically from the washer on to the receiving end of the. grader. Your extension authorities will advise you the proper strength of materials and how to mix them. We would emphasize the importance of adequate rinsing and as a general principle, we would suggest from two to three gallons of rinse water per bushel of fruit. Less quantities have been sufficient In many cases, but a thorough rinse is equally important with thorough washing. With dryers a unit of the washing equipment, there Is no delay In the pack- Ing operation. The fruit comes to the sorters clean and bright, and facilitates the sorting operation. The smaller models of washers are usually operated by electric motors of about 5 H. P. or gasoline engines of around 10 H. P. The larger models use from 7% to 10 H. P. electric motors and gasoline engines of from 15 to 20 H. P. Tractors furnish a good source of power for these large model washers, where electricity is not avail - able. Water under pressure is not necessary as the washers are </seg>
            <seg id="p518">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE provided with pumps for circulating the rinse water. Drainage away from the washers is important, but they should not be drained into any stream having a fish population. The future of the washing process and washing equipment will be largely one of adaptation to the individual problems in the dif - ferent sections. The more southern sections, where late season spray - ing is heavier, will operate their washers somewhat slower and per - haps with increased strength of solution. The more northern sec - tions with lighter spraying schedules will be able to operate some - what faster and perhaps use weaker solutions. The washing process is not primarily a co-operative packing house proposition, but an in - dividual problem the same as your pruning, spraying, fertilizing, pack- . ing and selling operations. Washing equipment is now available in sizes within the reach of all commercial growers and indications are that this will become an accepted part of fruit handling operations in the east, the same as it has in the northwest in the last four years. The market is showing a preference for clean fruit and the washing will place eastern fruit in better position to compete with the closely graded, carefully sized fruit of the northwest. MR. HOPPERT: Mr. Herminghaus will show us some pictures and tell us about some of the famous Italian Gardens. I am pleased to introduce to you Mr. Ernest Herminghaus. "FAMOUS ITALIAN GARDENS" MR. ERNEST HERMINGHAUS MR. HERMINGHAUS: There are a lot of things that have been called the eighth wonder of the world. Perhaps there are a few of you here that can name the seven, and how many of you can name the ten commandments? . However, the most distinctive wonder of the world is always the eighth whatever it may be. The Italian Gardens built in the 15th and 16th centuries during the height of the Italian Rennalssance have been justly termed the Eighth Wonder of the World. There are some very interesting things about them. They were built by the extremely wealthy dukes and princes of the church. The dukes and cardinals of this period had acquired great wealth which they expended on their magnificent Villas. They built them not only to display to better advantage the col - lections of antique sculpture, but also to escape the heat of the Italian summer. Accordingly they went. into the hills and mountains to secure a breeze and a somewhat lower temperature. All paths were shaded either by trees or pergolas and water was in abundance for its cooling effect. Since it is very hot in Italy one is not alarmed to discover that lawjjB and flower' beds were almost impossible to maintain and they </seg>
            <seg id="p519">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY had been so unaccustomed to them that they did not become an uw&amp;- Inal part of. their schemes. Grass and flowers have since been intro - duced, sparingly, by the English who have acquired some of these villas about Florence. I am now going to show you some slides that, give you some ideas of these gardens, perhaps far better than I will be able to describe them in words. The first slide is of the Villa Castellum, built by one of the great Medicis. Notice the orange trees in beautiful boxes and vases. They were designed by architects and this is true of the entire villa. The architect has a better grasp of design than the landscape architect because he has a better training. Thus it is that these great gardens are important for .their architecture and that the great landscape architects of today are architects by training, such as Charles A. Platt and E. L. Lutyens. This next slide is the Boboli Gardens at Florence, built in the 15th and 16th centuries for private use but now fortunately a public park of magnitude and enormous interest. You will note that an amphitheatre is used as foreground to the palace rather than a pure garden setting. Yet it is so supremely well handled that it is prac - tically a garden. The isolotta, an island within an artificial and highly architectural pool, is one of the beauty spots of all Italian gardens. The fountain is collosal, the work of the great sculptor John of Bologna and per - haps the finest bit of garden sculpture to be found anywhere in the world. The Garden at Villa Pia in the Vatican is an interesting compo - sition of logia walls, benches, stairs and garden house with little or no verdure. The court is paved with flagstone and a mosaic is created. It clearly shows that gardens can be built without using plant material. At Sienna the gardens were smaller than any other section of Italy. Villa Gori is not only noted for its Ilex tunnels which lead put to the fields of the farm but it is noted for its garden theatre. In it the wings are formed by Cypress hedges with one lone tall "splkey" sentinel at the rear. The Villa Gamberia at Florence is of the more modern type. It - was built in an early day and for a century or so went to rack and ruin. Two English ladles have acquired it and are rebuilding It with consummate taste. The water parterre is decidedly modern and the ■ Cypress hedges have not yet reached the stage in growth necessary to complete the design. Caporolla, one of the great Villas of Italy, shows the use of hedged parterres. Hedges are coming into use more and more in the modern garden. Here is a simple and beautiful geometrical design. In this slide you see the use of Italian Cypress, ilex, laurel, olive and stone pine, elements of planting material that are distinctly Italian and without which Italian gardens are not Italian. Thus in England and eastern America, this note in the Italian design is missing. In </seg>
            <seg id="p520">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE uainornia, however, it is possible to grow these plants and conse - quently the Italian Gardens there are more typical. Here are. some views of the Great Villa d'Este at Tivoli, some seventeen miles from Rome. It took eighty years to build, and the cost ran into two millions but Cardinal d'Este made the investment. There are no open spaces except for water; all areas are. heavily planted to make shade and its cooling effect. The water in this garden is supremely handled. There are fountains by the thousand, pools, cascades, falls, basins and whatnot. The problem of water was left to a hydraulic engineer, the plumbing is of lead and consequently is still functioning nearly five centuries after it was built. Villa Lante at Bagnaia is of comparative small size, more Inter - esting to us because it is reasonable yet no one in this day and age ever attempts to expend so much on a garden. Lante is 300 feet wide and 900 feet long. There are about five levels. The first level is square 300x300, consists of a water parterre surrounded by a geometrical beds which are surrounded by hedges. The very fussy designs in low hedges is strictly French, an influence which crept into all Italian gardens in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Italians are very simple in design while the French became very ornamentally involved. At Lante Vignola, the designer was so anxious to express the main axis that he did not wish it to be interrupted by the palace. Conse - quently he made two palaces or casinos on each side of the center line of the garden as a whole. This main axis is expressed in water by means of pools, basins, fountains and cascades. The various levels are separated by walls, not sloping banks. The Italians are born stone masons, stone abounds everywhere and the idea to substitute a slope for a wall never entered their head. Thus it is one of the distinctive features of Italian Gardens for they were always built on side hills. At Villa Medici at Rome the noteworthy items are the hedge parterres and the gravel court garden at the side of the palace. Note that flowers and grass are missing. Their place is taken by hedges, water and gravel. This villa has been occupied and owned by the French Government since the time of Napoleon and is the home of the French Academy of Fine Arts. At this villa originated the famous statue of Flying Mercury and the Venus de Medici which is almost as famous as the Venus de Milo. At Villa d'Este at Lake Como the interesting thing is the Cy - press alley. It is five hundred feet long and about thirty feet wide. Two rows of Cypress, two paths, two series of small stepped pools and a grass mall in the center. Grass here because it 1b in the north of Italy where conditions for growing grass are better. Isola Bella, another Italian Lake Villa, is built on an island orig - inally solid rock. It was necessary to blast and wreck the rock to fit the design and every cubic inch of soil had to be brought over from the mainland, a task tremendous in itself. The main portion of the de- </seg>
            <seg id="p521">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY sign consists in a series of terraces truncating into the reservoir ui top. The water storage was at the top level in order to give pressure to the water features. This system of narrow levels with walls on a steep bank is the principle of the hanging gardens of Babylon. Such are the Italian Gardens of Italy, the finest examples of garden design in the world's history. They are the result of a very superior, appreciation of art on the part of the Dukes and Church Prelates who built them and the craft of architects and sculptors from a period likely never to be excelled in the production of genius. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: If there are no questions to be asked, we will pass on to the next number on the program. Mr. C. E. Carey, Director, National Home Planning Bureau, Davenport, Iowa, will speak to us on PLANNING THE OUTDOOR LIVING ROOM C. E. CAREY, Davenport, Iowa. MR. CAREY: The wonderful talk we have been listening to on Italian Gardens has brought out a principal that we should avail our - selves of, in planning our own gardens. I have just been pondering over the fact the speaker brought out that some of those pergolas took say eighty years to build. -We get impatient if it takes four or five years for us to accomplish a simple task that we may plan. Some of 'the inspiration of those Italian gardens was worked into them be - cause they were developed with sufficient patience to accomplish what had been planned for them. So why not in our own plans ask our - selves — what we are going to do with this we are setting out to attain? Whether you appreciate it or not, a good deal of the charm of the finished task is going to rest in that patience of purpose, if you know what you are setting out to do and then have the patience to do it, think how much more individual pleasure you are going to get out of say the garden you are planning. Now, we are going to take up a kindred task, that of planning the outdoor living room, if you will let me use that phrase. Slide No. 1 . . Some philosophers interpret all human action as a result of a desire to realize personal happiness. Considerable of that personal happiness center around the great and beautiful wish that most of us' cherish, to have a home or to have a better home. Is it any wonder, then, that so much effort In thought and time is expended in making this wish an accomplished fact? Slide No. 2 Naturally our first thought is for the building in which we live. It Is always the house first, for that means comfort and shelter. The usual course is to begin by satisfying these demands. This is unfor- </seg>
            <seg id="p522">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tunate, because it often leads to a complete neglect of consideration for the exterior. There is frequently no thought given to the setting of the house and to the fact that there should be outdoor rooms as carefully planned and furnished as those indoors. It Is forgotten that as much pleasure can be had from planning and developing the grounds as from planning and furnishing the rooms within the house. Slide No. 3 But where there is cause for sorrow there is also cause for joy, for more and more is this condition being righted. More and more is the realization of the importance for the proper consideration of the grounds being felt; and an increased number of people are getting out into their grounds and spending leisure hours in that delightful contact with nature, familiarizing themselves with the joyous art of gardening. Every properly planned place adds that much more to the cause. Improvements are observed, interest fs aroused, and a more extensive and general desire is created. That which was considered non-essen - tial is becoming to be looked on as essential. . The home owner who has previously thought but little of the landscape development of his grounds now turns with an inquiring eye to see what his neighbor has done and looks over his own place to see what he can do. Is it any wonder that in this revolutionary state there has been considerable experimental work done and mis - takes made from misguided effort? But this only proves that the universal wish is for the better type of home which means better houses and well planted home grounds. Slide No. 4 It is typically American to want to put up a good front, and in our home grounds this desire usually finds first expression in the so called foundation plantings. In fact so universal is this desire that unplanted, or poorly planted, front yards are the exception rather than the rule. Slide No. 5 Regardless of the size of your- home property and regardless of the size or type of architecture of the house itself, a foundation plant - ing of properly chosen and properly placed plants will mean much, not only to the appearances of your propery as viewed from the street, but to the cheery welcome awaiting you at the end of the day. The real purpose of the foundation planting is to soften the harsh lines of the man made house as they meet the more natural lines of the grounds. These plantings may take on many forms and with a wealth of plant varieties to choose from, each and every home owner has unlimited possibilities for personal expression In their own front yard plantings. </seg>

Attractively planted streets result in beautiful cities, communities which we are proud to call home and communities in which we may be assured of a healthy, happy family life. Too often, however, this em - phasis on front yard planting means the utter neglect of the prop - erty to the rear of our houses. This seems too bad for it is in this area of our home grounds that we find our greatest opportunities for the outdoor use and enjoyment of our property. SUde No. 8 For centuries folks have sought for the Fountain of Youth, the elixir of life, only to find, in the words of Al Jolson, "That your hap - piness lies right under your eyes, back in your own back yard." Slide No. 0 The vogue for beauty outside the home, as well as within, is upon us — and this new vogue finds its most charming expression in the modern outdoor living room. This new fashion results from more than the public's conscious - ness of "backyard" barrenness. It is the home owner's own solution to the problem of how to get the most value out of his property, and the most enjoyment out of living. The charm of flowering plants tastefully arranged to create a vertitable living room outdoors is irresistible; and the prospect of planning a place out-doors which is attractive, liveable and comfortable — where the whole family can find countless hours of enjoyment — Is fraught with expectant adventure. Slide No. 10 In the average home building lot, there are two sizeable spaces left after the home is erected — the "front yard" and the "back yard." There are many who dislike the term "backyard" for It calls to mind memories of yards as well left unseen. Perhaps because away from public view, the back yard was, for a long time just a yard, unadorned and all too frequently neglected. It was everything that the outdoor living room is not; It presented no beauty for enjoyment; It was not a particularly pleasing thing to look into from rear windows of the house, not a place to take guests. There was no privacy to be found there. Slide No. 11 But the "back yard" is the ugly duckling of an age gone by. Today it shines in resplendent new dress. The finest and most at - tractive of plants are gathered there, arranged in living walls to shut out the discordant world and create the loveliest of home pictures. </seg>

The "back yard" be - comes a living room outdoors. Slide No. 13 Think what It means for your children to grow up in the environ - ment of beautiful plants and flowers. The outdoor living room pro - vides the ideal background for children's play. The room may be planned with ample lawn space in the center for games, swings and other play activities. Such, an attractive, fresh air play room out in the open will keep children interested in home, safe and away from the streets. Every parent can appreciate what that means. Slide No. 14 Then, too, children love flowers; not with the appreciation of the adult, but with a child's Interest. The gay colors attract them, the feathered folk that take residence in the plantings are a constant source of interest. Such a background of beauty is sure to enrich the child's mind, founding a love for beautiful things; and awaken ap - preciation for the better and finer side of life. As the child grows older, memories of childhood days and of home will become dearer from this environment of beauty. Slide No. 15 The children have no choice, but some day they will realize what the outdoor living room in which they played meant and thank you for creating it. Slide No. 16 Ask anyone who has planned and created an outdoor living room all their own, what they have derived from it, and you will receive an enthusiastic tale. First, you will hear about the joy of planning it — how first hours were spent contemplating possible arrangements. These are the dream hours, and there is as much pleasure in dreaming just how you will furnish the outdoor living room as planning new things for the Inside. Then you will hear of the spring days — plans made with the nurseryman or his representative, of the excitement when the plants arrived and were set out; and of how, suddenly dreams became real, lines on a sketch turn into graceful, leafy shrubs which burst into bloom again each year. Beds drawn on paper turn into glowing masses of flowers, with gay blossoms nodding in the sunshine. Little circles of the plan now become living, leafing trees, ready to play their part In the picture. </seg>

Guests will come, see the attractive grounds, and admire your home; tea may be served out-of-doors; often a quick, pick-up picnic meal can be en - joyed outdoors without riding twenty miles in the car and losing lots of time. Again, there is ever-changing spectacles in the planting. First, in spring, the bulbs and early flowers appear; then waves of riotous color follow, during the months. Slide No. 18 As blossoms come and go; the blaze of autumn colors dies into the fairy like beauties of hoar frost on naked twigs. Slide No. 10 It is essential to screen the view of all that is unsightly and un - attractive. Likewise it is desirable to shut out the view of the passer - by, so privacy may be enjoyed. The outdoor living room should be an intimate room, comparable to the indoor living room from the stand - point of the family's use and enjoyment. All neighborhood surroundings may not be unlovely, yet one of the first principles of planning the outdoor living room is to have the interest center in it, and to make the view in every direction attractive. To do this, first consider the screen planting. This should be high in some places and low In others, to effectively shut out the undesired view and make an interesting sky line or eye line to the planting. Where high screens are needed and little space available, every locality offers, native tall, spire-like trees which can be grown in small space, close together. Tall spreading trees likewise screen, but require more room for spread. Medium-tall screens are best secured by using medium-tall grow - ing trees, or tallest shrubs, which are sometimes classed as trees. Lowscreen plantings are generally made up of medium-height and low growing shrubs and evergreens. Slide No. 20 The ceiling of the outdoor living room is no problem at all — the sky itself, is one of the lures of the outdoor room. But in hot summer months shade is welcome; a few trees, or maybe only one, if broad and sheltering, will provide comforting shade. Trees are also important in the decorative scheme of the outdoor living room.' Sometimes they are planted in the border and some - times singly on the lawn. In the background, they give height to the planting, making it more interesting. Trees which flower and bear attractive fruit are needed for color and winter beauty. Trees of picturesque habit, some of the Pines, and Hawthorns, have their places in some arrangements, and there are many trees, formal and regular in shape, to choose. Evergreen trees provide year 'round foliage and color. Impossible in any other kind. </seg>

OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Slide No. 22 Only In the outdoor living room can there be such superb effects in decoration as nature provides in her lavish blooms. Starting with the earliest spring-flowering bulbs, you can have a constant procession of gay-colored flowers throughout the season. Flowers breathe life and joy into the planting; they suggest gayety and laughter. They make us feel their carefree spirit in spite of our carea and worries. To have these lovely friends you must plant them. It is best to concentrate most of the flowers in borders directly in front of the background planting around the edge of the outdoor room. Where an unusual number of flowers is wanted, extra beds may be worked into the arrangement. Slide No. 23 After we have completed the building of our house we discover that there are certain outdoor areas remaining for our use and en - joyment. Like the room arrangement within" the house, these areas may be set aside and designated for certain outdoor uses. This slide shows the usual and logical outdoor rooms. To the front of the house is the so-called front yard or public area. To the rear of the house, and adjacent to the kitchen, a service area. Here will be accom - modated the garage, vegetable garden, clothes drying yard and similar outdoor service uses. This leaves a relatively large area to the rear and side of our house, and directly connected with the living room indoors, whioh we call the private area, or outdoor living room. Slide No. 24 While preparing the plans for our outdoor living room develop - ment, we soon come to realize that there are many and varied ar - rangements which we can give to its planning and furnishing. Two such modes or styles of development are illustrated on this slide. The so-called formal and informal. The style you will use on your home property will depend upon many things. The size and contour of the grounds may influence the style. So likewise may the size and archi - tectural style of the house itself. Regardless of which you may use, even the smallest of outdoor living rooms can be most enjoyable and most useful. As an aid to the planning and planting of an outdoor living room in your own back yard, the following slides picture what others have accomplished. SUde No. 25 This first outdoor room plan offers a delightful scheme in the informal manner, quite within the reach of the average home-owner, as pictured here, it is adapted for the average lot where all the space in back of the house can be devoted to the outdoor room, except such space as is left for garage and service use. </seg>
            <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY In planning the outdoor living room of informal character, avoid stiff hard lines and regularity, both in line and in planting. Try for an orderly, yet pleasing, treatment of plant-masses and open space in some such manner as shown on this slide. Slide. No. 26 For this type of outdoor room there Is no best arrangement nor set rule to follow — generally the center space is left open. Lay out shrubs and flower beds in graceful curves, wide in some places, nar - row in others. Make the beds wide, as a rule, where higher planting is desired, such as in the corners. In the planting, aim for natural effects, choosing plants whose graceful habit of growth will contribute to the pleasing irregularity and freedom in the border. Slide No. 27 Variety in the material chosen will insure year 'round interest and beauty in the planting. Slide No. 28 As the space available for an outdoor living room is most often square or rectangular, the simplest plans tor the outdoor room are often laid along geometrical lines. In fact, very limited areas, where practically every part can be seen at a glance, can often be developed more pleasingly in some formal, straight-line manner. Contrasted to the plan on the preceding slide, the scheme il - lustrated here shows the same space developed along formal lines. Instead of irregularity in plan and planting, here is definite regularity and symmetrical balance. Slide No. 29 The central feature of interest is a vine-covered pergola with paved or stone-flagged floor. This feature is placed in the exact center of the far end of this outdoor living room. On each side of it appear two spire-like trees which accent the central feature, and frame it with green. The open space in the center is practically rectangular in shape, consistent with the geometrical form of the outdoor room. The planting is dignified and restrained. Along the left boundary, the living room wall consists of a neatly trimmed hedge in front of which appears a long border of hardy flowers, of such proportion that sea - sonal and color effects can be achieved without stint. Slide No. 30 Where the lot is large and there is enough space for an outdoor living room development between the living room side of the house and the lot line, there Is usually an opportunity to plan two outdoor rooms, one at the side as well as one at the rear of the house. Just as it is in the home where there is a living room and a sun room which open from one to the other, so likewise two rooms can be planned for outdoors — doubling. the beauty and enjoyment. </seg>

In the plan shown here, the space directly adjoining the indoor living room is planned along formal lines, around a central feature of interest which might well be a charming water garden. Slide No. 32 A hedge marks the outer boundaries of the living room plot, forming the living wall which separates this middle open air "room" from the outdoor living room to the rear of the house. Tall, narrow trees form the screen at the edge of the property, and flowers decorate it in abundance. Slide No. S3 The outdoor living room in back of the house is an . informal development, with the interest centered largely in the plant material dominated by .a large tree shading a table and chairs. Slide No. 34 If yours is a sloping lot, and not too steep, you may have dif - ferent levels in your outdoor room. The two or three-level treatment affords unusual interest and charm; and variety impossible on a level lot. First; the sloping lot must be graded to two or more practically level areas. The ground can still have a little slope, not noticeable, but that portion where chairs and table are used should be level. The upper and lower parts of the outdoor room may be separated by a retaining wall or a terrace slope. Slide No. 35 In this plan, the upper terrace directly before the house has a garden-like treatment with beds of flowers around the sides in formal plan. The center Is left open for circulation. A hedge marks the edge of the terrace, and makes a background for flowers. Slide No. 38 The lower level may be a "room" informal in character in pleas - ing contrast to the formal design near the house. This suggests the general treatment for such space, but may be varied to meet different requirements. Slide No. 37 Walled 1n, the court type of outdoor room will be most attractive if planted simply in such manner as suggested in this plan. The center is left open, with a fountain or pool featured there. Beds along straight lines follow the wall, emphasizing the plan. Archi - tectural lines are relieved by flowers and trees. This plan can be easily adapted to any small plot regardless of enclosure. </seg>

This plan like the one preceding, is designed for a small area, yet may be enlarged, in proportion, for larger space. Slide No. 40 Beds along the walls and each side of the center space provide ample area for characteristic plants and flowers. SUde No. 41 Those who have carefully followed the slides and discussion thus far must have observed the repeated association of the living room inside the house with the plan and scheme for the outdoor living room. The point which the plan on this slide illustrates is that, where space permits, an outdoor living room can be developed entirely apart from the interior arrangement of the house, and be just as Inviting and Interesting as any outdoor room into which we may pass directly from the house. Slide No. 42 The advantage of an outdoor room of this type lies in the sur - prise interest, and in the possibility it offers for a pleasing approach walk, which, if laid out. with flower borders on each side, can be a joy,' indeed. Slide No. 43 For the purpose of giving variety to the suggestions for outdoor room schemes this plan shows a circular arrangement, which is best treated in formal manner. A scheme of this kind can be developed close to the house just as well as away from it If the planting Is prop - erly handled. Additional flower beds are provided apart from the outer borders, a feature that will delight the flower lover with Its possibility for many flower arrangements and combinations. This is the "spare room" of the outdoors — a most appealing fea - ture for the larger grounds.

Slide No. 50 On a farm there is usually more space to give to such a plan than on a city lot. Here you can develop practicaly any type of out - door room you wish. In the country, where surroundings are natural, it is fitting to make the outdoor living room informal. The planting should be naturalistic, in keeping with, the part of, the native land - scape.

The side toward the high - way opens into a smaller outdoor room with beds of growing flowers; or this latter might be planned as bird garden with plants that are attractive to birds. Slide No. 52 All the plans I have shown offer some suggestions for comfort in the outdoor room. Shade trees to shelter chairs and a table, per - golas, arbors, seats and benches; all of which make the place more inviting.

Hottes, Garden Editor, Better Homes and Gardens, Des Molnes, Iowa. You are going to be delighted as you listen to the next speaker. I know that because we enjoyed so much hearing him when he was here before. HOW TO MAKE ATTRACTIVE WINTER GARDENS By ALFRED C. HOTTES MR. CHAIRMAN: Nebraska friends, 1 think this is a great honor to come back the second time to any one community. It is a bit dif - ficult to come back again, for it may tax one's versatility, because one doesn't want anyone to remember you may have said the same thing when here before or that you repeat your material. Now I am assigned this topic, "How to Make Attractive Water Gardens." That is quite in keeping with the program you have had this morning, on Italian Gardens and outdoor living rooms. It is difficult for us to know why. Why are we always searching for the "know why" of things? When you want to be cool, you search for a little pool of water, or a big pool, or a lake, or even the sea. You see a lake up in Colorado, or up in the Canadian Rockies and you wish you had that at home. You come home and plan a water garden, with a design to carry out the thoughts left with you by the lake you have seen. So let's apply some of those inspirations. "You may look upon a mountain and wish It were loftier or more precipitous; upon the river, and wish it were clearer; upon a tree, and wish for some greater spread of its boughs or some richer shad - ing of its foliage. But you cannot look upon a water lily and wish it to be other than it Is." (By Mrs. N. E. Lovejoy, In the Journal of the Columbus Hort. Society, 1887, p. 198). </seg>
            <seg id="p532">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ihe water lily is known as the delight of the water. An Egyptian tradition was that the earth rose from the water and the various deities were seated upon water lilies. The water lily here referred to is the nelumblum. The biblical reference, "They cast their bread upon the waters and it returned unto them an hundredfold," is based on the fact that lotus seeds are often planted by placing a seed in a ball of clay and tossing it far into the water. The seed grows and produces a new plant which blooms and seeds again. The seed is used for making starch and later is made into butter. Brahma was born from a lotus at sunrise in Tibet. The Rench missionaries say that every person in the villages prostrates himself in the public square, and the holy invocation, "O gem of the Lotus!" goes murmuring over the hill and valley like the sound of many bees. It is the utterance of an intense desire to be absorbed into that great Brahma whose emblem is this secret flower. The mystic formula is carved on pavements; it flaunts from flages on temples; the wan - derers to other lands carve the blessed words upon cliffs and boulders. (Mrs. N. E. Lovejoy). The Japanese say that the lotus is the exemplification of the household proverb, "Even tho thou were born in a hovel, if thou has lived well thou cans't rise to be the greatest. So, from the mud, grows the water lily into the pure and spotless flower." Plants Grown in Pools The commonest are Nymphaeas — water lilies, pond lilies. 1. American species are white or slightly pink. 2. Australia and Africa — light blue. 3. India — red. 4. Florida and Mexico — yellow. 5. Sweden— pink. There are hardy and tender varieties. Some of the tender sorts are day-blooming and others are night-blooming. Many of the night - blooming ones are natives of the tropics where the flowers open at night and are shielded from the burning rays of the sun. The tender sorts are usually characterized by having: 1. Larger flowers. 2. More beautiful colors. 3. Large and often scalloped foliage. 4. Flowers often stand above the water instead: of floating. Nelumbium, or Nelumbo: \ Commonly called the Egyptian Lotus. ' Characterized by having large leaves with stock attached in the center like a handle of an umbrella. Leaves and flowers stand at least a foot above the water. Flowers pink, red-dish purple, or white. </seg>
            <seg id="p533">NEIiRVSKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Seed pods are large and pepper-box like. The root stocks are long and whip-like. Should be planted in round tubs, otherwise the new shoots often grow towards a corner and cannot escape. Water Hyacinth, Ichhornia: A pest in Florida. Leaves with inflated bladders. Flowers somewhat like hyacinths. Bloom only when roots are in soil. Water Poppy (Lliunocharls) : Three petaled, yellow poppy with mostly floating leaves. Not hardy. Water-Snowflakes: Dainty plants with pure white flowers which have a some - what fuzzy appearance. Plant them in boxes or pots in shallow water. A few submerged plants which act as oxygenators: Elodea. Cabomba, or fan-wort. Myrlophyllum, parrots-feather. Vallisneria, map-grass. Plants for boggy soil in margin of pool: Cat-tails — confine them in boxes as they spread too rapidly. Arrowhead, or Sagittaria. Umbrella Sedge — not hardy. Kgyptian paperplant, Papyrus. Pickerelweed, (pontederia). Perennials for surrounding pool, growing in moist soil but not water: Ornamental grass. Marsh marigolds. Purple loosestrife. Yellow flag iris. Day lilies.

            <seg id="p534">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Soil Each plant needs one foot of good soil and one foot of water. Boxes 3x4x1. Leave 4 to 10 feet between plants. Rotted vegetable matter from bottom of ponds mixed with 1/3 rotted cow manure. The plant food needed besides manure would be a small amount of bone meal dug into the soil, one quart to a bushel of soil. Lime should never be used. Water Water for lilies should be stagnant, warm if- possible. Not any continuous flowing form of cold spring. No fountain. Overflow desirable. Planting Hardy water lilies may be planted any time in the early spring or summer from April to September. Tender water lilies should not be placed in pool until water is somewhat warm and all danger of frost is past. Start tender lilies slowly, gradually increase depth of water. Cover plants with sand or gravel. Keeping Pond Clean Algae may be killed by using one teaspoon of copper sulphate to each 13 cubic feet of water. Potassium permanganate acts more quickly and leaves nothing injurious in the water. Five teaspoonfuls of saturated solution to ever 13 cubic feet. If potassium permanganate is used too strong, it may affect fish. If they seem to suffer, add fresh water to the pool. Remove dead flowers. Insects Black aphids: spray forcibly with hose and give light doses of nicotine sulphate. Leaf Miners: Some spray with arsenate of lead; others advise removing leaves. Stem Borers: Remove Infested leaves. Fish The common gold fish will live in any pool which is not frozen to the bottom. They are useful to destroy mosquito larvae. Use 25 fish per 100 square feet. If there is plenty of submerged plant life, it will not be neces - sary to feed the fish. &gt; </seg>

Drain the pool and fill with fresh water or try one fish in the pool to see .if it lives. Wintering Water Lilies Hardy water lilies may be wintered in the pool if it can be drained. The plants should be collected In one corner of the pool in boxes or covered with sand or ashes and then with a thick layer of manure. Better still, remove boxes from pool and bury In a protected place. Tender lilies should be taken into the basement, stored in damp peatmoss or spahgnum moss. Construction Kinds — 1. Formal. 2. Informal. A. Reinforcement material: Chicken wire; 3-inch steel bars as used in construction of large buildings; heavy wire. B. Be sure that spot is well drained. Place layer of cinders or gravel beneath. C. Water lily pools should be 2 feet deep. D. Forms may be used for the formal pool, made from wood. For the informal pool, wooden frames can be built and heavy roofing paper used instead of wood for the sides. E. A coping of bricks, cut stone, or cast concrete. F. Thickness of walls should be at least 6 inches. Pools Without Forms 1. Dig a trench, or 2. Merely make a hollow' in the soil. Mixing Concrete To figure amount of concrete necessary for each cubic yard, it will require for a 1-2-3 mixture, 7 sacks of cement, 14 cubic feet of sand, and 21 cubic feet of gravel. Moisten sand and gravel first, then add cement. Mixing machine preferred but first class concrete can be mixed by hand. Be sure every pebble of gravel is coated with cement. Be sure to have concrete well mixed and tamp it into form. Form should be greased with motor oil. As soon as forms are removed, give a smooth finish coat of cement and water put on with paint brush, trowel, or broom. It may be wise to give inside of pool a coat of water-proof cement as soon as it is hard. </seg>
            <seg id="p536">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE now in closing; mention has been made of informal gardens. In the February number of Better Homes and Gardens, we men - tioned what John Sedding says of informal gardens: "Behind all the contents of a garden sits primal Nature, but Nature to advantage dressed, Nature in rich disguise, Nature delicately humored, stamped with new qualities, led to new conclusions by man's skill in selection and artistic concentration. A garden is man's transcript of the wood - land world; it is common vegetation ennobled — outdoor scenery writ - ten in man's small hand. It is Nature's rustic language made fluent and intelligible." And of formal gardens, Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer writes: "A formal garden is not man's transcript of the woodland world but a wholly new conception based on architectural knowledge and elab - orated by architectural taste." Both informal and formal gardens have merit, of course. Some of us are by nature formal. We like formal clothes, stiff hats, every - thing neat and orderly, filing cabinets, and budgets. There are others (and I confess I am of this class) who find more charm in informal clothes, soft collars, informal people, and a disorderly desk. Prim - ness, propriety and pruning is the charm of the one style; spontaneity and romantic wildness characterize the naturalistic style.

PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: We will now announce another change in the regular order of our program., Mr. Carey has consented to change places on the program this afternoon with Prof. Keim, who has an engagement at another meeting in a very few moments. The topic which Mr. Keim presents this afternoon is: "Is There Anything Better Than Blue Grass for Nebraska Lawns?" By Prof. F. D. Keim, Department of Agronomy, Lincoln. We will now hear from Prof. Keim. </seg>
            <seg id="p537">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY IS THERE ANYTHING BETTER THAN BLVE GRASS FOR NEBRASKA LAWNS? PROF. F. D. KEIM, Department of Agronomy University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska I suppose I might answer this question with Ernie Hoppert's favorite answer "That all depends." Or I might dispose of it very quickly by saying "I don't think so." In either case some explanation will probably be in order. Generally speaking I doubt if we have at the present time a better grass for lawn than Kentucky blue grass. It does fairly well on low slightly alkaline soils, stands a fair amount of acidity, stands flooding in good shape and stands drouth remarkably well. It is true of course that it dies down during the hot summer months unless it is irrigated but when the fall rains come again it brightens up in fine shape. Seldom do we see a field of blue grass kill out due to un - favorable soil and weather conditions. If it does kill out man usually has a hand in it. Blue grass has become one of the greatest pests in the subirri - gated hay meadows in the Elkhorn valley. These folks do not need to worry about obtaining and maintaining stands. It is a nuisance as a hay and about the only value to these farmers or to us is the fact that these fields of blue grass are furnishing some very fine quality seed. The question still remains that we have trouble in getting stands of grass in our lawns and we have difficulty in maintaining these stands. I feel reasonably sure that it is not the fault of the blue grass but chiefly a matter of proper care and attention. With your permission I would like to briefly discuss some of these difficulties before I take up other possible lawn grasses. Buy Good Seed Always Not enough care is taken in buying good clean viable seed. I have with me a small box of seed that I purchased in a store down town. Printed on the bottom of this box is the purity analysis and germination. Redtop 15%, Canada blue grass 7%, rye grass 28%, white clover i%, timothy 23%, inert matter 20%, weed seed 2%, other agricultural seeds, 4%, and average germination 80%. The only grasses in the mixture that is worth anything for permanent lawns are the redtop and Canada blue grass. Rye grass is good for quick starting but usually only lives one to two seasons. Timothy is one of the poorest grasses for lawns. It is bunchy and has a light color and gives an extremely poor appearance to a well kept lawn. The only reason it was added to the mixture is the fact that it Is one of the cheapest grasses on the market. Timothy is persistent and dif - ficult to get rid of when it once gets well established in a lawn. 2% </seg>
            <seg id="p538">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 01 weed seeds, that with 23% timothy is enough to spoil any lawn. Besides there was 20% inert matter made up chiefly of red top outer glumes that was entirely worthless. The small percentage of white clover was all right but I am not very much of a fan for white clover lawns. No matter how carefully you prepare your soil and how care - fully you plant this seed you are bound to be disappointed in your lawn. If you are the least In doubt, and I think you should always be in doubt, send a sample of this seed to the State Seed Analyst and ask for a purity and germination test. Careful Preparation One cannot prepare the seedbed too carefully. I do not have time to go into this but this seed bed must be solid, fine and compact. There must be enough loose dirt to cover the seed. This seedbed should be prepared long enough in advance so that it is entirely free from viable weed seeds. These weeds are much easier killed out before planting the grass seed than afterwards. Every spring it is a very common sight to see mother and the children or father after working hours out throwing grass seed on the lawn. Sometimes not even the old dead grass is raked off before this seeding is done. Grass seeded In this manner has. not the slightest hope of coming up and thickening the stand. The old dead grass should always be raked off and the grass seed raked into the soil and watered continually until it is up and has possession of the ground. Early Seeding I am a firm believer in early seeding. Any time after the frost is out of the ground is not too early. The lawn .grasses are perennials. and, therefore, are much more resistant to freezing than the summer annual weeds. In fact summer annual weeds do not come up until in June. If blue grass is seeded the first of April it will have such a start of these summer annual ■ weeds that the lawn is fairly sure to hold its own during the summer. Early, seeding in the fall is also good practice. Blue grass seeded August 15th will make a splendid sod by November provided of course good growing conditions are maintained. ; Water Well After blue grass or any lawn grass has been planted it must be k£pt well watered. Best results I think are obtained where the lawn is watered every day. I planted some blue grass about September 20th last fall and some times sprinkled it two or three times during those hot dry fall days. I have a growth nearly two inches high and a wonderful stand. Watering Encourages Grab Grass After the lawn is well established too much watering during July and August encourages crab grass and other summer annual weeds. I realize the lawn will not look quite so green but it will look much </seg>
            <seg id="p539">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY better in the fall if this crab grass is not given so good a chance 10 develop. Bo Not Mow Too Close Blue grass lawns are nearly always clipped too short. I am just like you are and my wife is probably also like yours. We all like to see a lawn clipped very short. In early spring and early fall this can probably be done but in June, July and August the mower roller should be lowered and the blue grass allowed to grow at least one and one-half or two inches tall. There are three very important reasons for this. The grass needs its vegetative growth in order to manu - facture more plant food to build up its root reserves. The taller grass will compete with the crab grass and other weed pests and the lawn will not dry out nearly so quickly. Professor Graber of the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment sta - tion found that blue grass pastures when pastured very close did not respond very well to applications of nitrogen fertilizer. There was so little reserve plant food in this closely pastured grass that the blue grass did not have strength enough to make use of the fertilizer. Professor Graber' plots that were not pastured or clipped so closely made maximum use of this nitrogen. Lawn Grasses Must Be Fed Light applications such as 1 or 1% pounds per square rod of ammonium sulphate or sodium nitrate two or three times during the -summer will increase the growth and thicken the stands. This increased growth also furnishes competition with weed pests. I am more incluined to favor these fertilizers than barnyard manure chiefly because the manure- so many times contains all kinds of viable weed seeds. Working manure into a new seedbed for a lawn to add more organic matter I think is good practice. In this case all weed seeds should be allowed to sprout and then killed before the grass is seeded. ' Lead Arsenato for Grubs and Worms After a lawn is three or four years old and sometimes even earlier grubs and earth worms become a serious pest. One pound of lead arsenate per square rod applied to the lawn each year will usually keep the soil poisoned so that these grubs will do little damage. Mixtures for Lawns A great many seedsmen and landscape gardeners prefer to seed mixtures of grasses for lawns. I am not adverse to the idea. I think there are . several advantages. Grasses like perennial rye (lolium Perenne) and even meadow fescue (Festuca Elatior) can be used. These grasses come up quickly, compete with the weeds while the slower blue grasses are getting started. At Cornell University one of the gardeners seeded one-half Kentucky blue grass (Poa Pratensis) and one-half redtop (Agrostis alba). He claimed under their condl- </seg>
            <seg id="p540">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tlons very good success. In a series of grass plots the Agronomy Department maintained a few years ago, a mixture of 60% Kentucky blue grass, 20% Canada blue grass, 10% perennial rye and 10% meadow fescue did very well indeed. After about three years prac - tically no rye grass or meadow fescue could be found. In fact the two plots, one seeded to perennial rye and the other to meadow fescue were practically taken by volunteer blue grass by the third year. The red top and Canada blue grass plots held their own against blue grass due to the fact that these grasses spread by under ground root stocks the same as the blue grass does. ' Canada Blue Grass (Poa Compressa) Canada blue grass does very well in Nebraska. It seems to be somewhat better adaped to adverse conditions of both soil and climate than Kentucky blue grass. The sod is usually not as smooth and dense as the Kentucky blue grass and it is a lighter and duller green. Rough Stalked Meadow Grass (Poa Trivalis) and Slender Fescue ( Fes t u cu Orina Xenuilolia) Rough stalked meadow grass Is sometimes very highly adver - tised. It has a beautiful yellowish green and makes a very fine soft turf. In our experiments it killed out the first year. We reseeded three years straight without success. The hot Nebraska sun and cold dry winters proved too much for it. We had the same experience with slender or creeping fescue. Bent Grasses (Agrostls Stolonifera) Without doubt the bents, which are close relatives of red top, ■' make the best grasses to use for golf greens. The smoothness and beauty of a well maintained golf green is almost unbelievable if not actually seen and walked over. Only under rather unusual conditions are the .bent grasses fitted for lawns. They not only take specialized knowledge but they take. a great deal of time and labor. The average farmer and business man is too busy making a living to spend the necessary time it takes to maintain a bent grass lawn. Bent grass turfs in order to appear the best should be mowed nearly every day. It is best to use a special greens mower. It is necessary to water nearly every day. They should be fertilized three or four times dur - ing the summer with ammonium sulphate! They should also be com - posted three or four times during the season with a mixture of sand soil and manure using a 2-2-1 ratio. Compost piles should be built In advance two or three years so that weed seeds will be killed and manure well rotted. This compost should be thoroughly mixed and screened and spread evenly over the surface. By the way one of these Iron door mats does this trick very nicely. If a bent grass green or lawn Is not mowed very close and composted regularly the sod becomes thick and fluffy and does not seem to root well. </seg>
            <seg id="p541">. NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Diseases such as brown patch, other pests such as gophers, moles, grubs and earth worms keep the greens keeper continually on the job. Picking and pulling out little weeds is another daily job. Now it is not my idea to paint too dark a picture. These tasks I have mentioned become merely routine for the greens expert. He usually knows' his business and he is always on the job. The business man may work one night and then get busy at something else and forget he has a lawn for a week or ten days time. Such a procedure will not work with the bent grasses but he will get by reasonably well with the old blue grass lawn. Some of the better varieies of bent grasses are the strains, known as Washington and Metropolitan. They both seem quite well adapted to our Nebraska conditions. Buffalo (Bulbilis Dactyloides} arid Alkali (Distichlis Shicata) Grasses On farms in the western part of the plains area buffalo grass makes a fine old stand-by, especially where water is not available. Buffalo grass is difficult to seed and about the only practical way 1b to set out sods six or eight inches square and allow them to spread by stolons. ' Buffalo grass is peculiar because we have both male and female plants. In other words the pollen grows on one plant and the seeds set on another. The low subirrigated meadows of the sandhills where the soil is quite alkaline the old alkali grass makes a very good farm yard turf. Mr. and Mrs. Sam Hudson living south of "Valentine have an alkali grass lawn and barn yard that any one would be proud of. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: This morning Mr. Carey spoke to us in a very interesting manner on "Planning the Outdoor Living Room." This afternoon he takes us into an entirely different realm. He will take up the subject of "Making Rock Gardens." MAKING ROCK GARDENS C. E. CAREY, Davenport, la. ■ I don't have just the advantage Mr. Hottes had when he talked to you this morning. He had appeared before you on a previous occasion. Now, in taking this subject I don't know what has been given to you before. I hope you will excuse me if I go into some A. B. C. fundamentals on this particular subject. I may, in giving an analysis here, get back into some fundamentals of the topic of rock gardens. But I fee} it is one well worth that deliberate treatment. In Europe, particularly in England, the rock garden is an estab - lished institution with a distinct following. In fact the English works on the subject alone form a considerable bibliography. </seg>
            <seg id="p542">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE On this side of the Atlantic, the rock garden Is so little under - stood that it is an almost unconsidercd factor in the beautifying of the home grounds. There are a few notable examples in this coun - try, all on large estates, and in more instances some excellent work has been done on a smaller and less complicated scale either by actual creation or by taking advantage of natural opportunities. But for the most part America has confined its rock garden vision principally to . the so called "rockery-" Now a rockery, with all its good intentions is not a rock garden. It is no more a rock garden than a line of trees planted in an ebcact circle would be a forest. A rockery is generally a lot of stones stuck in a pile of soil or, worse yet, a circular array of stones filled in with earth. A rock garden, above all else, is not artificial; at least, so far as appearance goes. It is a garden with rocks. The rocks may be few or many, they may have been disposed by nature or the hand of man; but always the effect is, or should be,, naturalistic, . if not actually natural. The rock garden's one and only creed is nature. Rock gardens are of so many legitimate — in other words — natural types, that there is not the lighest excuse for a rockery. Even that commonest of excuses, finding a use for stray stonep, falls to the ground. Any close observer of nature is familiar with these types. The natural rock gardens range from the patches of alpine plants above the timbetr line in high mountains down the lower slopes and through defiles to fields .on or near sea levels. Not Infrequently they come down to the very sea, while sweet waters commonly define and what is better, are now and then incorporated in them — here a pool, there a brook, and bog, too, the heath and the desert, they take unto themselves, though perhaps only the nearer edge. Here in a nutshell, are not only the natural variations of the rock garden, but the inspiration as well. No rock garden worthy of the name has ever been created by man that did not depend upon a study of those that nature has given the world in abundance. There were the why and the how of it all, and man simply saw and made use of his observations. The advantages of a rock garden are, primarily, an element of picturesqueness that nothing else can provide, and the possession or a place in which can be grown some of the loveliest flowers on earth that, if they flourish at all, will never do as well in the ordinary garden as in conditions more or less approximating their' natural habitat. Also it may be made a place for real living out of doors. Occasionally — and here is one of the most important things to be learned about the rock garden — it is the very key to the garden situation; there are small places where no other kind is worth while, if indeed it is possible. </seg>
            <seg id="p543">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The best site for a rock garden is where it ought to be. Vu» id a sad truth, for it eliminates some homes from the game, but use - less waste of time will be saved if. this is recognized at the outset. First cast your eye about and see if you have a spot where a rock garden would look as if it belongejd there; that is the supreme test. If one does not belong there give up the idea philosophically and take it out in enjoying the rock gardens of other people. Better yet, concentrate on the planning and planting of some other type of garden more suited to your property. As a rule* the rock garden should not be near the house; it is • something savoring of the wild that does not seem to fit in with most architecture. Exceptions are when the house is on rocky sites that makes such a scheme desirable, if not imperative^ and a slope from the rear or side of a house that seems decided enough to permit a sharp break in the general landscape treatment. Save in these cir - cumstances, it is better that it should not be in sight of the house. This is not so hard as it seems, for even on a small place, the spot is easily concealed by a planting of evergreens or shrubs. Nor should the rock garden, any more than the rockery, be out in the lawn unless it be depressed and therefore out of sight, or mainly so, from the, level. The depression may be a natural or an artificial one, it may be a brook with high banks or it may be a sunken pathway. The edge of a lawn is better, a corner of it is better yet, and preferable to either is a bank sloping down from it. The bank on either side of steps leading from one level to another is also a possibility to be considered. Trees need not be altogether avoided; sometimes they are es - sential to the pictorial effect. It is not well, however, to place a rock garden near very large trees. The drip is bad for alplnes, and the greedy roots not only rob the plants of nourishment but are very apt to dislocate the stones. Somewhere just outside the real garden is the best place; then it is only a step or two from one little world ino another that is altogether different. If the rock garden leads to a bit of wood, there will be all the more to glory in. The more irregularity the site has, or suggests, the better; a rock garden not only should have no straight lines, but it is not well that all of it should be seen in a single view — no matter whether the area be large or small. Thus far the assumption has been that the rocks have to be gathered up from various parts of the place or brought In from the outside. Of course this must be so on the average small city place. But many grounds, especially in the suburbs and country, have the rocks; often more than are wanted. Altho sometimes this is the best of luck, now and then the trouble of blasting and rearranging is about as great as if all the stones had' to be found. It does, never - theless, make easier the choice of a site; where rocks are naturally, </seg>
            <seg id="p544">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE uivn they ought to be. Occasionally the rocks are so disposed that there is no choice; the site settles itselt and it is up to you to make the most of it. A single boulder, .a few scattered rocks, or a rocky bank can be converted into a simple rock garden without moving a stone. A little judicious planting and the transformation is complete. A rock garden with water is rock garden glorified. Wherever possible, without injury to the main scheme, the garden should be brought to the water. Failing that, bring the water to it. Spring is the best time to make a rock garden, though one may be started at any time the ground can be worked. But by starting this spring, you may have considerable joy and happiness from yours before another winter sets in. When the important matter of the proper site has been definitely determined, a well considered plan should be formulated. Here desire will have to be subservient to the situation. It is not so much what you want as what is best in the circumstances. Do not attempt to copy the rock garden of some one else. All the money in the world would not create an exact duplicate for you, since nature has made no two rocks alike. Study these other gardens, of course; get all the ideas you can. But study first, last and always, nature, more particularly as you find her in your neighborhood. Anywhere, every - where, there is abundant opportunity, it is your task and pleasure to hunt it out. Measure carefully the space at your command, and then lay out the plan on paper. Your nurseryman will be glad to help you with the details. Now, figure out a good entrance,' and, if possible, an equally good exit — the one invisable from the other. Then outline the main path, which should be as Irregular as the situation allows. Remember that you are not merely to simulate nature; you are, by a process of compressing much in little, to epitomize nature. Then comes the selection of the rocks. Barring quartz rock, which does not look well, almost any kind of natural stone may be used. Artificial stone should be shunned like the plague, however. Limestone and sandstone are good materials. Weather beaten granite is excellent material, and in general. It is well to have the rock look anything but newly quarried. Pick out Borne rocks with a growth of lichen on them, and be sure that this is not disturbed by the moving. Boulders may run up to several tons in weight. Where none is readily obtainable, one can be simulated by combining a few small ones and concealing the joints by the planting of such things as stonecrops in earth — which, save In rare cases of sheer necessity, is alwayB used In the construction of a rock garden In place of mortar. </seg>
            <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY If the site is level, the next step Is to change all that — first on paper. There must be some excavations, but no depressions deep enough to catch and hold water just where you will want to walk. Aside from the path levels, building begins with the rocks, not with the soil. This is an important point. Place: the boulders first; they are the big effects. Then start in with the outlining base rocks. These should be placed with the largest surface to the ground and should vary in size. It is not essential that the lowest rocks should be burled in the ground, but that course is preferable. When the paths and outer margins have been defined, scatter more rocks over the intervening surface, placing them fairly thick but not close together. Next, fill in with soil, packing it firmly and ramming it hard into every crevice. If it fits in with the day's work, it is not a bad plan to water the rock work well in order to pack the soil, and when resuming the labor on the morrow, to add more soil, well pressed down, before proceeding with the second layer of rocks. This second layer should have the rocks placed with front edges slightly back from that of the lower ones, in order to form a slope, though an occasional overhang may be fashioned if required for cer - tain plants known to abhor a drip from above. The construction then continues until the desired height is reached. The rocks used as fillers should overlap here and there to give strength, but be sure to leave plenty of long soil runs or pockets. Eighteen inches should be the minimum. The roots must be in no danger of loose soil or of striking a hidden hollow. Those rocks used to imitate natural stratification ought to be laid on .an incline for proper drainage. Such pieces may also be em - ployed in wedging and in the making of the so-called "pockets." These pockets are a prime importance for they hold the only consid - erable spaces of soil, and are the chief means of colonizing plants, thus providing for pronounced color effects. The soil must slope a little from the top, so that there will be no standing water. The drainage of a rock garden is of vital import. There must be plenty of moisture stowed away behind the rocks against the heat of summer, but all excess must be carried away. The rock garden should drain naturally, as do the hills. If any doubt exists, make a drainage bed of eight inches of clinkers before starting to lay the stones. The soil should be a good loam with a little peat. A little manure may be used, but it must be old. There are two ways of planting a rock garden. One is to do all the planting along with the building of each layer; and the other to del er all planting until the rocks are - in place and the soil thorol j&gt; settled. The first plan is appealing, as well as practical, for by this ' method good-sized plants may be firmly established in pockets at the </seg>
            <seg id="p546">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE very uutset. The soil in that case should be put part way in the pocket and then packed down. Then some loose soil sprinkled on top, and the plant laid down horizontally with its crown just outside the edge of the soil. Next spread the roots to follow the soil run; fill up^the cretvice with more soil, packed well, and so on until the task is complete. Use small stones to wedge plants where it appears necessary. Plants that hang down should be placed in the higher pockets. This, of course, should all be thought out befora hand. The best way is' to consult your nurseryman in order that the most suitable subjects may be selected. The general idea Is that all soil shall be concealed, at least at the end of one or two seasons, growth. Unless you are a collector, variety is of little importance. The main thing is that there shall be beauty as a whole, a few marked seasonal effects of color with massed bloom and some green the year round; the garden must never be bare at any time, as nature will show you. Plants massed here, and as specimens there is a good planting rule. Colonies, always of marked irregularity, ought to merge into one. another, but they should not so overrun the rock work that no stones are in sight. Not infrequently some of the best effects are obtained where more rocks than flowers are seen. Study the form of the plants that are to be used; some quickly resolve themselves into a carpet, some never get beyond mere tufts, nome always grow straight up, some prefer to hang down, and some have foliage that is evergreen or nearly so. Obviously, plants that have a decided hankering after moisture or shade should be favored in the matter of location, though it is astonishing how adaptive many of them are. Do not plant the weak next to the strong. Finally, do not forget that planting is not the end; it is only the beginning of planting. So long as the rock garden exists there will always be planting. Normal mortality will account for some, there will be thinning out, and time will suggest new addi - tions and more or less rearrangement. And with the planting goes on the care, most of which can be done in the course of the daily work in the garden, and therefore the loss of time will not be felt. Water in case of drought, not a light sprinkling, but a thoro soaking to a depth of several inches. Mere surface watering is bad enough in the other gardens; in a rock garden it may prove fatal. Go over the garden thoroly at least twice a year, and all the time, keep a sharp lookout for weeds. If the soil seems heavy, top-dress with grit in the fall. Stone chip placed around a plant will prevent too much moisture lodging about the collar in winter. Watch out for weak spots after very heavy rains. </seg>
            <seg id="p547">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY So many plants are suitable for the rock garden that I hesitate to even start on a list. Your nursery man's catalog or his personal advice, is the best guide. ' Annuals as class are not desirable for the care of renewal is too great. Biennials are almost as much care, but in each case there will always be be exceptions that are a matter of personal choice. The main dependence must be placed on perennials— the plants that, bar - ring accidents, last for many, many years. The evergreen trees, shrubs and vines will of course have their place in the completed picture. These then are the fundamental rules to be followed if we are to succeed with our rock garden. What a real pleasure it is to con - template the creation of one. What greater joy to actually plan the complete one. Why not decide right now to have a rock garden as a part of your home grounds beautiflcation this year. Now, while the rest of your plantings are resting in preparation for the coming spring's display is a good time to lay plans for this most fascinating of all garden endeavors. May you find as much happiness in so doing as I have in meeting with you today. Thank you. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: We thank Mr. Carey again for his splendid instructive presentations to us. Our next number is to be given by Mr. H. I. Perrin of Sargeftt, upon a subject with which he is well acquainted, GROWING THE GLADIOLUS IN CENTRAL. NEBRASKA . MR. H. I. PERRIN * Mr. Chairman, Fellow Gardeners and Flower Growers. I am not ' a professional gardener or flower grower, nor have I ever attempted to speak before such an assembly before. You will all no doubt agree to this before I get through. But I will attempt to give you some of the history of the Gladiolus experiences as I have learned them during the past nine years. Some of you know that I am just a common watch tinker and jeweler located in a small town near the center of the state. Way out In the sticks if you please as I was Informed by a barber this morning. I agree with him but at the same time I think we are able to enjoy nature in its beauty to a larger extent that those of you who are cooped up in he city. Personally I do not envy you in the least as I spent two years in the city and have always preferred the country to live in. After about fifteen years at a watchmaker's bench I found that if I was to be able to continue my Inside work it would be necessary that I get more outdoor exercise and' recreation. As golf had not </seg>
            <seg id="p548">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE .n mat time penetrated that far from civilization (for which I am truly thankful) I took up the growing of glads as a hobby. I can still remember the enthusiasm with which I perused the different seed catalogues trying to find where I could spend about $5 to to the best advantage. I finally bought a mixture of 100 corms as advertised by a well known seed company in a near by state as their extra select mixture. I do not think that I ever planted any expensive corms in later years with greater care than I did that first order. Imagine my surprise when they bloomed to find that my extra select mixture was composed of about 65 Halleys, 15 Wilbrink, 6 or 8 America, a few Cracker Jack and the rest divided among two or three similar varieties. But even that mixture gave me the glad fever, and my wife says that from all indications It has never abated in the least. And as for myself I should hate to be cured entirely of the disease. I soon found that if I was to get the most from my hobby that I did not want to grow any more mixtures. I wanted to be able to call them by name when I met them in my own or a neighbor's garden. It will mean a great deal more to you to be able to say this is Miss Des Moines, that other clear lavender over there is Minuett. See that white over there with the giant spike, that is Helen Wills. Or you come to a wonderful giant red and immediately you know that Red Tornado has arrived. So on down thru the rows in your own or another's garden. How much more it means if you take a bouquet to a friend or some one that is sick and say, "I brought you a spray of Jewell, or Los Angeles today." How much better that sounds than if you have to say, "Here is a spray of just flowers." So after that first order I bought only named varieties and kept them separate. Buying new ones each year and discarding some when I found something similar that appealed to me of superior quality till my records show nearly 800 varieties have been listed with nearly 400 still being grown. Some ask well I wonder if I could grow flowers like these. I would say that any one that has a small patch of ground on which such vegetables as beans, peas, or potatoes will grow fairly well can grow excellent glads, if you get good stock and are willing to use plenty of elbow grease. If you have made up your mind to grow some glads the first thing that comes Into your mind is naturally the purchasing of stock of corms. Most growers list three sizes — large 1 " in diameter and up; medium %" and up; and small which are %" and up. Others list as many as six sizes and are numbered 1, 2, 3; 4, 5, and 6, start - ing with the smallest which is %" and under; each size being %" larger than the one before It. Then when they get to No. 1 which is listed as 1%" and up. Unless you are a commercial grower you will </seg>
            <seg id="p549">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL, SOCIETY not be but very little Interested to start with at least In any but the two or three larger sizes. And the size you will buy will be determined In a measure by what you want them for. If for landscape work you will be able to get very good results with medium to large bulbs. And you will want to ask for or select those varieties that are of medium height, have strong stems and good foliage so they will stand up well in our gentle Nebraska winds. You should also take Into consideration the number of florets that are open at a time. Selecting those that do not open all at one time or nearly so. For if you do, your blooming season would soon be over. There are other varieties that throw side spikes after the main bloom stalk is out, prolonging the season and making them very acceptable for landscape work. While If you were planning on having them for cut flowers, or for the show room, you will want and should demand large conns from 1% Inch in diameter and with full or high crowns. I might say here that they say there are exceptions to all rules. So It is with the glads. There are a few varieties that never make a very large bulb and others that I at least have never been able to get to develop a high crown corn bulb. I never saw a very large corn of Baron Hulot, nor a high crowned Gold Eagle, yet both give excellent results. The larger corms will throw up from two to three and possibly more flower spikes while the medium and smaller ones possibly only one spike. But to get a specimen bloom for the show room I should rather have a medium sized high crowned conn than an extra large flat one. Many times any glad fan is asked to make out a list of the ten, twenty or more best glads. Now like the old gentleman who exclaimed when he first saw a giraffe that there just wasn't any such animal, I should say there just ain't any such list. For what I would select would not appeal to another at all, no doubt. So when you see a list made out by any one person it only reflects the reaction of that in - dividual to those that appeal to him. I might not please you in the least. As people visit my gardens I find of course a great deal of dif - ference as to the selections that are made. But as a whole, the men usually .will pick those that have the brightest colors, especially the giant reds and those that have many florets open at a time. While a majority of the women are attracted by the more delicate shades, in the pinks, in the creams and lavenders, and look for artistic ar - rangement of the florets on the spike rather than to having a large amount open at one time. But there are lists from which you can choose your colors with the knowledge that this list gives the highest rated glads as balloted on at the test gardens and shows. While many may not please you personally you know no variety that continues to receive a large num- </seg>
            <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ber of votes year after year would get them if it did not have merit. This list changes from year to year as newer varieties become more widely grown and people discard some of their old favorites for some of the later introductions. A glad may make a fine landscape variety yet be worthless or nearly so as a cut flower. Here we have to have a- stalk of sufficient height so we can cut a good stalk and yet leave at least four leaves on the growing corm so as to develop it properly for another year. And we also want more blossoms open at a time. Personally Betty Nuthall appeals to me the most of any glad that I have ever grown or seen in another's garden. It is a very large coral pink with an orange throat. But there are many others such as Angels Dream, Miss Des Moines, Jane Adams, Mother Machree, Gloriana, yes I could go on and on naming favorites that I would place very near to Betty; and I would certainly hate to have to be tied down to even fifty or a hundred varieties. I watch the results of the different gladiolus shows and in that way you can find out the ones that appeal to the public and then you have to shut your eyes and buy. If you have made a good bet, O. K., if not, it may appeal to your neighbor and you can make a trade with him or her for something that you may like that does not appeal to them. Now about preparation of the soil. I prepare mine the same as I do for my vegetable garden. Either have it ploughed or spaded eight to ten inches deep and then worked down till you have a' solid fine seed bed. I hesitate to say how deep or how far apart to plant for there seems to be a great deal of difference of opinion on this sub - ject and the different growers all get good results which proves that the glad is not particular in its habits and easily grown by anyone. . But the depth you will plant and the distance apart will be gov - erned by the amount of moisture you have available whether natural or artificial. Also the kind of soil you have makes a difference as to depth of planting. If plenty of moisture is available the glad can be grown quite close together. I believe Mr. Dunnman was at my place one year when I had them planted in double rows the spacing being just the diameter of the bulbs apart and the rows just wide enough so you could walk between if very careful; in fact they were just one foot apart. From a little distance it had almost the appearance of a solid bed of flowers. It is the only time I exer planted so close. For it was surely a hard job to keep them cultivated. But I never had bet - ter bloom than I did that year. Although I do not think the increase was as good as when they were planted further apart. If your soil is heavy as it appears to me around Lincoln I should plant from three to four inches deep. The rows eighteen inches apart and the corms twice the diameter of the bulbs apart in- the rows. If </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY you have sandy loam such as I have I increase the depth about one inch. If you do not have water available for irrigation in drouth periods such as we had last year, I would increase the depth about another inch in both types of soil and space the rows further apart. I have grown hundreds of bulbs out on my brother's farm where no irrigation is available planting six inches deep and about four to six inches apart in the rows. The rows are spaced the same as his corn and potatoes so they can be tended with the horse cultivator. I never failed but one year and then we planted but three or four inches deep instead of six as I should have. How many of you ever dug a ditch with a hoe to plant anything in when it said a ditch four inches deep? The dirt piles up on both sides of the trench and it looks like things would never come up. Yet I venture to make the assertion* that unless you have taken the pains to measure your trench after removing - the dirt that has piled up along the sides till it is level with the surrounding soil that our four inches is rarely more than two and one-half to three at the outside. And to make a ditch with a hoe five to six inches deep is some job. I always trenched with a spade till about three years ago when I purchased a garden tractor and I now use a furrow opener and John D. does the heavy work now. There are some varieties that have to be planted a little deeper to make them stand erect, even then I have never been able to get Golden Measure to stand up if we happened to get a heavy rain soak - ing the ground and then followed by a wind. But the deeper planting helps a lot. This information you can only get by experience. Tour nearby grower or the one from whom you purchase your stock can tell you if any of the varieties you buy have such tendencies. When planted, we hill up the dirt along the row so that in about a week we can rake down this ridge killing many weeds that would otherwise have to be pulled out of the row. We then keep up con - stant cultivation after every rain or irrigation whether weedy or not. I have never found it necessary to irrigate large or medium bulbs till they begin to throw up the bloom stalks. Then if needed I soak them thoroughly every ten days and cultivate as soon as it is dry enough. Gradually lessening the depth of the cultivation along the rows, finally ending up by just keeping a dust mulch. This Is done for the reason that at about the time the bloom starts the new bulb is starting to form immediately above the old conn and we do not like to disturb these any more than possible. Now comes cutting time. Pick your bloom early in the morning while the stalk is still full of water raised during the night and the sun has not had time to evaporate any of it. Cut with as long a stem as possible but be sure to leave at least three to four leaves on the plant If you expect it to produce you a good corm for another year. Immediately put the stems in a pall or vase filled with water so six or eight inches of the stems will be covered. Set them in a cool </seg>
            <seg id="p552">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE place and they will fill up with a large amount of water so they will hold up much better when brought to the light and atmosphere of the warm room in dry summer weather. Cut off a small portion of the stem each day changing the water and most varieties will open up to the last floret on the stem. ■ After the first hard frost or freeze we start to dig the corms cutting the stems off just above the bulb or corm. If we only have a few of a variety we store in paper sacks, if many in shallow trays or boxes letting them dry out for a day or so and then storing them in the cellar where we keep our potatoes. After about a. month to six weeks the old bulb and roots can be easily removed leaving you a nice clean bulb for another year. I start to plant the smaller sizes as soon as the leaves start out on the trees in the spring. And continue planting till near the first to the 10th of June. This extends the blooming season from about July 10th till frost cuts them down. But there are some varieties such as W. H. Phlpps that should all be planted real early as they take about 110 days to bloom. I have not mentioned anything about how to plant the bulblets. These are the small hard shelled fellows that you find clustered around the bottom of the new bulb when you dig it in the fall. These if planted and cared for for a year or so will give you large bulbs of the same variety as the mother bulb. And this is the only way that - bulbs can be propagated in a commercial way. You will get some increase from most varieties each year from a natural division of the old bulb. But this is very slow and they seem to deteriorate to some extent when they get old, as the bulbs generally get flat and hollow. Again with bulblets you can purchase them very cheap as compared with the large bulbs and after you become used to growing them you can be able to purchase and grow a small stock of the more expensive varieties at a very reasonable price. But you will have to wait at least two and perhaps three years before you are able to get a specimen spike of flower. But if you have never tried growing from bulblets I would not advise you to try any of the expensive ones the first time. They are sometimes very hard to get to germinate. I always soak them for four to as high as six or seven days and then plant them in a trench about two and a half inches deep scattering them along the row real thick. About 100 to the running foot of the trench. Planted close in this way they seem to help each other to come thru. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: Now our closing number is another great treat. Again we will listen t6 Mr. Hottes, on "How You Can Interest Boys and Girls in Gardening." MR. A. C. HOTTES: I told you some interesting things this morning on how to make attractive water gardens.

Don't sit around here this afternoon if you are going to let yourself be more than thirteen or fourteen years old, when we take this trip through fairyland that we are going to take with the children. I don't want you around here acting too intellectual to enjoy this. While the slides will present to the eye, you must turn back your mind with us if you are going to make this trip. We are all going to be children here this afternoon. Let's take this- in through eye and ear and trace it through our mind, as a bunch of children. We have been taking the Junior Garden Clubs of America through this trip and we are delighted now to take you with us. Now the pictures will be shown and you should follow along the story as I give it. In no other way can this be learned than through the work of our Junior Garden Clubs: Now, let's go. THRU THE GARDENS OP GNOMELAND WITH THE! JUNIOR GARDEN CLUBS OF AMERICA ALFRED C. HOTTES Of course Cousin Marion receives loads of mail from all of the Junior Gardeners, but one morning there was a bright-colored en - velope in her mail. She couldn't imagine who would be sending her a letter in such a bright-colored envelope so she hurried to open it. And whom do you suppose it was from? It was from the King of Gnomeland, inviting Cousin Marion and all of the Junior Gardeners to visit the Garden of True Happiness. Cousin Marion knew that every one of her Junior Gardeners would just love to take this trip thru these beautiful gardens, and so she immediately accepted the old King's kind invitation. However, it would be Impossible for all of the Junior Gardeners all over the United States to go at once, so she has arranged for the members of the Junior Garden Club of your city to go on this adventure thru the Gardens of Gnomeland today. 1. Just outside the garden gate we are very much surprised to see this little old tumble-down house, with the door hanging by one hinge. The house looks cross-eyed, and an old dead tree stands just outside the door, and there is an old black raven building its nest in the tree. Sitting at the foot of the tree is a grouchy looking old Gnome with colored glasses. He does not seem . to see the Junior Gardeners or pay any attention to them. Louise stops and. asks him, "Why, what's the matter, Mr. Gnome, you look ill?" Of course, she doesn't want to tell the old Gnome that he looks grouchy because that wouldn't be polite. But the old fellow does not answer. Mar - garet whispers to Louise, "I believe that he has the doldrums like </seg>
            <seg id="p554">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE we learned about In 'My Garden Book.' Remember It says that people that do not have gardens usually look cross and grouchy. •For doldrums, is an illness That can really ache and hurt But the cure that's safe and certain Is digging in the dirt.' " "Come on with us into the Happy Garden of Gnomeland and just see how lovely it is," says Margaret. Still he does not answer. "What made your tree die?" asked Louise. "Don't you know that trees keep the hot sun out of your house and make a nice home for the birds so that they will sing for you?" Then the old Gnome grunted, "I don't want any trees." "I believe it's just because you don't know how happy they would make you, and how much fun it is to grow pretty, bright - colored flowers. I'm going to tell you about Priscilla's garden. Prls - cilla is a member of our Junior Garden Club." 2. "The Garden of Dainty Priscilla." 3. The dainty Priscilla was heard to exclaim: 'My garden shall be very much like my name, With beds all in neat geometric design — An old-fashioned garden shall surely, be mine.' Thus gayly did little Priscilla make plans For bowers of beauty — like all garden fans. But little she guessed when her garden was done That all of the neighbors would find It such fun. 4. Old grandmother Higgins who walked with a cane Declared, 'It's the hest in Hollyhock Lane, For it makes me remember when I was a girl With feet both a-twlnkle and heart all a-whirl.' Old Mr. Martin who always looked sad Came into this garden and really looked glad. 'My mother's old garden far off by the sea Was just like this old-fashioned garden,' said he. 5. Said old Mr. Casey who brought fruit and flsh, 'A garden like this is my heart's fondest wish! Shure it makes me all over!-*— I'm young once again A-dancin' wid Maggie down Shaughnessy's Lane.' The tall Mr. Brewer who studied all day And Tony who carried the garbage away, • The wealthy Miss Cabot who lived all alone Declared it a garden they'd love for their own. 6. Priscilla announced, 'To the end of my days The old-fashioned flowers are all I will raise; </seg>
            <seg id="p555">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY I'm sure I don't care for a garden that's grand But I do like a garden that folks understand." 7. "I even have a picture of Priscllla's garden so that you can see how pretty It is." Louise then takes the picture of the garden from her pocket and shows It to the old Gnome, while Bill and Jimmy and the other Junior Gardeners stand around adding a word now and then. Even the old doldy Gnome seems to be Interested in the story of Priscllla's garden and what fun all of the neighbors got from it. "Do come with us thru the gardens of Gnomeland and we are sure you will feel better." "I can not." replies Old Doldy, "They wouldn't let me in now be - cause I would never have a garden at my house." "Oh, yea, they will, if we take you," says Cousin Marion, "See, I have a special Invitation from the King of Gnomeland. He will think you are a new gardener." "Well" — and the old Gnome hesitated. "Come, go in with us," chorused the Junior Gardeners. With this Bill gets on one side of old Doldy, and Louise gets on the other, and they take him off with them. "You come right along with us and you will feel better," say the Juniors. "We are going on a trip thru the Gardens of Gnomeland." Old Doldy goes rather Blowly at first as if he really doesn't want to, but he soon forgets all about his doldrums and starts laughing and talking with the children. 8. After we walk just a little way we come to the Garden Gate of True Happiness that leads us into the Gardens of Gnomeland. Old Gardy opens the Gate for us. When he asks why Old Doldy is with us. Cousin Marlon explains that our Junior Gardeners have made him interested at last. The Gnomes are happy to see the Junior Gard - eners. Old Doldy is so happy to be back in Gnomeland that he kicks his slipper away into the air. The Gnome wearing the red coat is Cherrlup, and he will be our guide thru all of this trip. As we go on down the path thru the happy Gardens of Gnome - land, Louise spies a bright-colored little flower over on one side of the path and fairly shouts with joy. "Look, at that pretty frilly flower. What is it?" 9. "That," said Cherrlup, "is the Shirley Poppy. Doesn't It look like a little girl's party dress? Remember now, this is the Shirley Poppy, and you can sow seed for Shirley Popples very early in the Spring. They don't last very long in the garden. The wind just blows their little thin petals away almost before we can invite grandma to see them, so we must plant seeds for Shirley Popples sometimes three and four times during the summer in order to have them for early spring, mid summer, and late fall." </seg>
            <seg id="p556">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 10. Then suddenly Jimmy sees the Peony. Of course he recog - nizes It, but It Is the very prettiest big white Peony that he has ever seen. As soon as he points to it, all of the Junior Gardeners rush over to smell it, for surely such a big and beautiful flower will have a very sweet perfume. Then Cherrlup tells the boys and girls just how we happen to have this pretty flower in our gardens. The Story of the Peony "Many years ago we Gnomes were sitting under a tree after we were pretty well tired from dancing in the moonlight. And I said to one of my friends, wouldn't it be great if the boys and girls had something in the daytime that they could enjoy as much as we do the moon? You know, a lot of the boys and girls have .to go to bed long before the moon ever rises. Surely we should give them something in the daytime that is just as beautiful. So we got together and put a great big white, full moon upon one of the plants, and no one knew that we had done it so they called it the peony. But, of course, I knew all of the time that it was really a full moon. The Chinese have always said that it was sacred flower sent from the moon, but they really did not know our story about it." Not far from the Peony the Junior Gardeners find a beautiful Rose. "What Is that moss growing on the bud of the Rose for?" asks Bill. Cherriup speaks again to the children, "Did you know that this Rose was not always so beautiful? It used to be just a plain cabbage rose." The Moss Rose 11. "An old Rose of a hundred leaves stood in a garden. It was unnoticed because its color was faded. Daily it reared its head higher that it might be seen but the gardener passed it by, always choosing its clear pink neighbor or its deep red friend, the Damask. " 'I have striven for height and fragrance but my cheek is not blushed enough. I am discouraged,' said our Rose, and losing its strength it bent toward the earth. "For a long time the face of the Rose rested upon a bed of Moss. How the little Moss longed for a word with the Queen of Flowers. " 'You are beautiful,' modestly said the Moss, 'and your frag - rance is wonderful.' " 'I am unhappy. Day by day I stand in the garden but I am never noticed,' said the Rose. 'You think that I am beautiful, I wish I really were. All Roses are expected to be charming.' " 'You are beautiful, but think of me. No one stops to pick me up to see my beauty, and not only that, you see the world from your lofty height, but I merely creep along the earth.' " 'Have you never seen the earth from above?' asks the Rose. </seg>
            <seg id="p557">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY " 'Never,' said the Moss, 'I can just look up into your leaves and they are my whole world.' " 'Jump on and I shall take you up with me.' "And so the Moss grew cautiously over the bud of the Rose and the next morning it was lifted up for a peep of the Sunrise. " 'How beautiful it all is,' exclaimed the Moss. 'How long may I remain?' " 'I'll take you down again in a few minutes.' "Just then the gardener passed and noticed the Rose. The Rose feared lest the Moss would be picked off and thrown to the soil; and the Moss trembled, believing that it was spoiling the Rose. But the gardener seemed pleased at the appearance of the Rose, he dug the soil about it tenderly. " 'Well, well,' he said, 'that is a Mossy Rose." " 'Stay with me always,' whispered the Rose to the little Moss. 'Did he not call me a Moss Rose?' "The Moss Rose was blushing with modesty and excitement, and has ever since continued to do so. In compliment to the Moss the Rose opens slowly and tries to allow the Mobs to cover its bud as long as possible." The Apple Tree 12. As we wander along we come to an orchard, and here we find a beautiful old apple tree. And then old Cherriup asks them if they have ever thought of the many uses of a tree. As you see in this picture, it is an apartment house for a Robin, a dressing room for the Butterfly, a concert hall for the Locusts and Katy-dids, and, as you well know, it gives us fruit for the cold winter's night. If you are a girl you know that it makes a dandy tent. If you are a boy, you love to climb it, but, of course, some girls like to climb trees too. So when somebody cuts down a tree, just think of all the good times they spoil. As Cousin Phyllis said, "The birds don't have any place to raise their families, the poor butterfly just wanders around without getting to clean up, the Locusts and Katy-dids are sad because they don't have a place to sing, the Squirrel doesn't have any storehouse for his winter's food, we can't have any more roasted apples, the little girls have to sit in an old, hot tent for their parties, and the little boys have to tease the girls because they do not have the trees to climb." 13. As we leave the orchard we come out along the roadside which is all planted with trees and pretty flowers. Here little Jimmy finds a big clump of Violets growing under one of the trees. "I'll bet you don't know how we happened to have Violets either," says old Cherriup. </seg>
            <seg id="p558">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Violets "When God cuts holes in Heaven The holes that the stars look thru He lets the scraps fall down to earth The little scraps are you." "Can you see the stars shining thru the Blue Sky? The sky doesn't look quite dark enough for night, but you know the stars are really shining in the daytime too, but the sun is so bright that we can't see them." 14. As we pass a Burdock, one of the Juniors ask, "What good is a Burdock?" 'Good for nothing,' said the Farmer. 'Good for a home,' cried the Toad. • 'Good for a prop,' the Spider thought. 'Good for play,' said the Child. "You see," said Cherriup, "What wonders We find at every turn — The idle flowers have honey sweet, The weed may be medicine, Since even a Burdock has its use." 15. After resting a little while, we start on down the road, which soon leads us into the beautiful woodland of the happy Gardens of Gnomeland. This is so pretty and so much fun that the Junior Gardeners all dance with glee and Jimmy even turns a cartwheel. "Come," says Cherriup, "and the Gnomes will teach you Junior Gardeners how to dance in a fairy circle." You know that in every fairy story that we have read there has been a fairy circle and we are delighted to have the Gnomes teach us the true fairy step. We danced to our own happy tunes, and our voices bring all of the birds of the woodland, and soon even the frogs and little bugs begin, dancing, as you see In the picture. Even the little birds' throats were begin - ning to get a little tired. So we all rest awhile on the pretty green grass under the fragrant flowering tree. Bill is sitting very still and seems to be thinking very hard. Finally he says, "I can't understand where all of these pretty flowers came from. Did the world always have them?" "No, indeed," answered Cherriup. Origin of Flowers 16. "An old Spanish story says that when the world was quite new, after the stars and the hills and the lakes were made, then came the plants. They were all green, and clothed the hills and the meadows. One day a beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky, and the fairies and elves were wandering along the rainbow, which is the </seg>
            <seg id="p559">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY many-colored bridge from heaven. They went farther tban usual, and discovered this new world of ours. They looked upon it with wonder. They thought they had never seen anything so beautiful with its cool green grass, rugged snow-capped peaks, and dashing water falls. 17, 18. "Like ourselves, they were not willing to enjoy this pleasure alone, and called all their friends. Finally, the rainbow became so crowded with fairies and gnomes that it cracked, and broke into thousands of pieces, which fell to the earth. Whereupon the world was not only clothed with green grass, shrubbery and. trees, but each of the plants of the world received some bit of the rainbow, and thus we have the origin of flowers. Some flowers are more than one color. They are the ones which got more than one piece of the rainbow." ■ ,, U 19. After this delightful story we are completely rested and are anxious to follow the path thru the Woodland Gardens. As we are wandering along,- Jimmy says, "Oh, look, here is a little pink piece of the rainbow. It looks just like an Indian shoe or mocassin." Bill says, "Why, what is that? I've never seen anything like it?" i Cherriup sighs and says, "No, I don't suppose you have ever seen a flower like that before. There are hardly any of them left. There used to be a lot of them, but people didn't treat them as they should. It is an Orchid, or more commonly known as the Ladysllpper. You will remember, won't you Junior Gardeners, that every time you pick one of these Ladysllppers no one else will ever see that flower that you have been fortunate enough to see. Wouldn't it have been too bad if someone else had picked this one before you got to see it?" "Can't we grow these Ladyslippers in our gardens at home?" asks Louise. "Yes, you can do it, but you must have just the right kind of soil. It must be acid and be in just exactly the right place. The soil must be very rich and loamy." 20. Again we start down the woodland path. After only a short distance, everyone seems to catch a fragrance in the air. "Somebody must have spilled a bottle of perfume," said Bill. "No, Bill, that is just our lovely woodland carpet, the Trailing - arbutus, or more commonly called the Mayflower. Of course, it doesn't bloom in May. Why do you think they call it the Mayflower? It was named for the Mayflower, the boat on which the Pilgrims came to America. This little plant can seldom be grown in your gardens be - cause it is almost impossible to do this unless you have just the right soil." 21. As our merry band of Gnomes and Juniors wandered on Jimmy comes upon a flower and exclaims, "I know what this flower is. It is Dltchman's-brltches." </seg>
            <seg id="p560">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "Why it is not," said Louise. "It is Dutchman's-Breeches, not Ditchman's-britches." "Oh, hum, I see you do not know the story," says Cherriup to Louise. Story of Dutchman's-Breeches "A long time ago some little Gnomes lived close to a ditch with very fresh clear water in it. Every morning they would go down to this ditch to swim, and they would always hang their trousers on the tall grass. One morning when they had played together in the water for a long time and were hurrying to get home before the sun came up, they went to get their trousers, or breeches, and what do you think? Their trousers were grown fast to the grass. So when people saw them growing, near this ditch, they called them Dltchman's breeches, and because the breeches were so wide they were finally called Dutchman's-breeches by persons who did not know where they came from." 22. Suddenly the Junior Gardeners hear singing in the distance. Hurrying down the path, the singing becomes sweeter and louder. Then as we turn a sharp corner, just at the bend of the river, we see it is the woodland choir of birds and bees that have been singing. All of the flowers have come to church services and are lined up in rows. Of course Jack-in-the-pulpit is doing the preaching. Jack-in-the-Pulpit Jack-in-the-Pulpit preaches today Under the green trees just over the way. Squirrel and song sparrow high In their perch, Hear the sweet lily-bells ringing to church. Come hear what his Reverence rises to say, In painted pulpit, this calm Sabbath day. Fair is the canopy over him seen. Penciled by nature's hand, black, brown, and green. Green is his surplice, green are his bands; In his queer little pulpit the little priest'stands. In black and gold velvet, so gorgeous to see, Comes with his bass voice the chorister bee. Green fingers playing unseen on wind lyres — Low-singing bird-voices — these are his choirs. The violets are 'deacons, I know, by the sign That the cups which they carry are purple with wine. And the columbines bravely as sentinels stand On the lookout with their red trumpets in hand; Meek-faced anemones drooping and sad; Great yellow violets smiling out glad. </seg>
            <seg id="p561">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY All are assembled this sweet Sabbath day, .. To hear what the priest In his pulpit shall say. Look, white Indian pipes on the green mosses lie!.- Who has been smoking profanely so nigh? Rebuked by the preacher the mischief is stopped. But the sinners in haste, have their little pipes dropped. . Let the wind with the fragrance of fern and black birch, Blow the smell of the smoking clean out of the church. So much for the preacher: the sermon comes next. Shall we tell how he preached it, and where was his text? Alas, like too many grown-up folks who play At worship at churches man-builded today — We heard not the preacher expound or discuss; But we looked at the people, and they looked at us. We saw all their dresses, their colors and shapes. The trim of their bonnets, the cut of their capes; We heard the wind organ, the bee and the bird, But of Jack-in-the-Pulpit we heard not a word. 23. Thinking it best not to disturb this very impressive service, we slip on down this beautiful path thru the Woodland of the Garden of Gnomeland. Not far from the woodland church we find a cluster of Lily-in-the-valley. Cherriup started to laugh, and he laughs so heartily that the Junior Gard'eners ask in chorus, "Do tell us the joke." The Story of the Ul y-in-the- Valley "Well," says Cherriup, "the King of the Gnomes had planned a big party, and had requested that all of the Gnomes go out in search of nectar for this happy event. Each Gnome took his cup and sped to the forest to gather the nectar. "When they came to a beautiful, mossy spot It seemed much more fun to dance than to gather nectar. So they hung their cups upon -blades of grass and started their festive dances. The dancing proved to be such fascinating amusement that they forgot that morn - ing was coming. Of course, it is against all the laws of the Gnomes that they should be seen in the daytime. When they became aware of the fact that the sun was peeping over the hills, each one rushed to his cup. When lo and behold — they could not .remove the cups from the grass, for they had grown fast. Just then the Queen of the Fairies approached and noted their distress. She said, 'Don't fear that, your cups have grown to the grass.' She raised her magic wand and said, 'Con-vall-aria!' This was the magic word transforming the Gnome cups into the bells of the Llly-of-the-Valley and they are often called by that magic name of Convallaria today. * . 1 . ' I </seg>
            <seg id="p562">BEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "And if you don't believe it, just smell these flowers and you will find that each little Gnome's cup still retains the fragrance of the nectar left in it by the Gnomes one night many years ago." "And now," says Cherriup, "we leave the woods. It's good that you had a rest. For from here we climb higher and higher but we shall see some very unusual scenery and plants." 24. "My, it is steep here," says Bill. At this moment we catch a glimpse of Castle Mountain where the King of the Gnomes dwells among his world-famous rock gardens. "Well, see who is here!" crys Bill. "Why, I don't know him," says Louise. "Oh, yes I do, that's old Doldy and he has beaten us here. Well, Doldy, why are you hold - ing that watering can on your foot?" exclaims Louise. Doldy says, "I found it and I shall take it back filled with magic plant food for my old tree." 25. "On, on, let us go on," calls Cherriup. We follow the path and soon come upon a white treasure. This is the Edelweiss (pro - nounced ay '-del-vise). Do you know what this means? It is a Swiss word for white treasure. Surely all the treasures are not made of gold nor diamonds. Such plant gems are better loved by the Gnomes than pearls or silver," says Cherriup. 26. "And here we have the Maiden Pink. It can be made happy in our own gardens. This Pink grows in sight of a glacier," says Cousin Marion. 27. It likes to peek over rock's at its little neighbor the Alpine Violet shown here. You can see such gems as these when you travel to the mountains in our National . Parks. They are Nature's gardens and we should love them enough to preserve them forever. This is a big country of big cities and we need to preserve such gardens of Nature all over the United States. 28. "Well, -well, here is the Pansy," says Cherriup. "You know he is a brother of the Violet. Did you ever see a flower that looked , as much like a face as a Pansy does? They just seem to smile at us at times, sometimes they wink at us,- and every once in a while when we have been naughty they seem to look cross at us. Have you heard the Story of the Pansy 29. "There was a king — a very fat, old king — who seldom left his throne because his feet were always cold. He kept his feet tucked into a deep green cushion. He had five daughters, of whom he was very fond. He always told them that he hoped they would never leave him, and they promised him that they never would. </seg>
            <seg id="p563">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY "Thru the years this old king and his five daughters have ucci. transformed into a Pansy. If you will look inside the Pansy, you will See the old king's face, with five petals, representing his five daughters. Then when the Pansy has passed its beauty and its petals curl, if you will look Inside the flower you will see the old king himself. Really this is the pistil of the flower. If you remove the petals carefully you may even see the green cushion into which the king has .pushed his feet." At last we reach the castle of the King of Gnomeland. We wouldn't dare tell all about the Castle and the King of Garden Gnomes because we would never get thru and besides everyone must visit such a place himself. 30. And so we start down the other side of the mountain. Old Cherriup asks, "What kind of gardens do you have at home?" With this, Louise takes a photograph out of her pocket. "See, this is my rock garden, old Cherriup. I have Maiden Pinks, Moss Phlox, and Dwarf Evergreens planted In it. I think the rock garden looks nat - ural, don't you? The stones appear as if Mother Nature had placed each one of them. I don't care how hard I have played, or how much I have helped mother, I always .want to walk along this path every day to see the new flowers which come into bloom." 31. "I have a- picture too," says Bill. "It's a picture of my informal pool which was made according to Cousin Marion's direc - tions. I placed my rocks so that they looked natural. I did not make a tight circle of rocks around the water. I let the grass and flowers come down to peek into the water." 32. "Our garden has a formal pool in it," says Margaret. "It looks straighter and more dignified like daddy looks in a dress suit, but I love it just the same." 33. "Here's a picture of the Water-lily I have in my formal pool. This is my very own Water-lily, and I have the most fun watch - ing it open each morning and closing in the evening." "Yes," says Old Cherriup, "these Water-lilies are just like boys and girls. If they are awake all day they must sleep at night; and if they are awake at night they must sleep. in the daytime." 34. "Here's a picture that I cut out of our Junior Garden Club page in Better Homes and Gardens. It shows the Garden Buds of Jollet, Illinois, in their rock garden. Aren't they a nice group? That is Mrs. Arbelter at the back — their counselor. I've always wondered if that is a real .deer, and if there are really birds living in that bird - house. It's strange how gardens make girls pretty and boys strong. How unusual that the same fun does two things." 35. As we descend rapidly we reach the base of the Mountain in sight of the Windowbox Hamlet of Gnomeland. ' Here the houses </seg>
            <seg id="p564">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are crowded almost as much as in New York City with no room for gardens except perhaps in boxes and on the window ledges. But the King of Gnomeland says that every person must have a garden of some kind. So every Gnome has a window box. 36. "Many Junior Gardeners have plenty of space to grow plants just as you have, but some are like Toby, and this is the story of Toby," says Cherriup. Toby's Window Garden 37. Little Cripple Toby Couldn't walk or run, He traveled in a wheel chair And seemed to find it fun. The children came to see him Nearly every day, He liked to read them stories, They liked to help him play. 38. So he was always happy Until that day in spring When all the other children Took to gardening. "I wish I had a garden," Said Toby with a sigh, "With bulbs and seeds of every Kind that I could buy." 39. "I'd like to dig the earth And see the flshworms crawl, And watch a daisy blossom And hollyhocks grow tall." But no one thought of Toby In his little cripple chair, For everyone was busy . • In garden's everywhere. 40. Till suddenly Priscilla Said, "What will Toby do? He can't work In gardens Like me or Bob — or you." "How shocking that we didn't Think of him before!" And off they went at breakneck Speed for Toby's door. </seg>
            <seg id="p565">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 41. The children got together And planted hollyhocks In clumps at either end Of Toby's window box. He planted sleepy seeds, And roots of several flowers, And watched them grow and blossom For many happy hours. ■ 4 2. A beetle came to visit, A butterfly to call, A bluebird came to sing, A fishworni came to crawl. "I've flowers to give to others From my window box, I've earth and bugs," said Toby "And butterflies and rocks." 43. The children were very good to Toby in the winter, but when summer came they all had their gardens to make, and sometimes they would forget little crippled- Toby. But Priscllla thought of Toby. Who was Prlscilla? What was it that Priscilla said? Remember the poem says, "A blue bird came to sing." I'll bet you haven't seen the two birds on Toby's roof. 44. "We have a lot of Junior Gardeners who live in big cities," says Bill. "They have only a little space. But here is a picture of a boy and girl in the .Hay Market District of Chicago, but they have a garden just the same. I wonder what they have growing in their garden? Well, it looks like Morning-glories, and Sunflowers. And look, when they just couldn't get any more flowers in their small bit of soil, they have gotten pots and put them on shelves in the window. . See too they have a light in their garden. When friends come late to see them, I imagine they take them out to their garden and turn on the light. Wouldn't it be fun to have a light in your garden?" 45. And now we come to the end of our trip. See these Junior Gardeners from Louisville, Kentucky. "It's a pity they couldn't go with us on this wonderful trip," says Bill. 46. "Well, here we are home again," says Louise, tired but happy. "This is where I live. Goodbye Cherriup, and thanks for taking us thru the happy Gardens of Gnomeland." "Goodbye, Junior Gardeners," says Doldy, "I shall never forget how happy you have made me, and the next time you come to Gnome - land, I will have a big live tree and a garden like dainty Priscilla." </seg>

HOPPERT When vacation time comes some folks go to the seashore for rest and recreation. Others travel to the northern lakes where bass, pike and other members of- the finny tribe are supposed to . abound and be ever ready and eager to bite at anything the fisherman may attach to his line but where generally mosqultos are much more num - erous than are the fish and much more willing and ready to bite. I used to spend an occasional vacation in this way but in recent years it has been my plan to travel leisurely by auto thru various regions of this country in order to become acquainted with the agriculture and particularly the horticulture of these regions. Usually there) is no definite route and no definite schedule so that if anything especially interesting is to be seen there is no occasion for omitting seeing it merely because we have to be at Paducka at 7:00 P. M. that night. Fruit growers in other states are a good deal like those in Nebraska; usually busy but never too busy, to talk to a visiting fruit grower; to show him his plantings and equipment, to . talk over problems and exchange ideas. If you have never tried this type of a vacation you've missed something. I am sure you'll be better satisfied with your lot after other growers have told you their troubles. This year when vacation time came we decided to visit Niagara Falls. There are several ways of going to this wonder of the world, but our route lay thru southern Illinois and southern Indiana. Much has been written and said in the last few years about the oriental fruit moth and its danger to orchards, particularly of peaches. Last spring the fruit papers reported that Congress had appropriated $100,000 for investigating its life history and for working out control measures. Headquarters for this work were established at Vlncennes, Indiana, where several thousand acres of peaches and early apples are located and where the oriental fruit moth has become firmly es - tablished. This was our first objective on last summer's trip. Upon arriving in Vlncennes we looked up the station where the work is being done and found that the work has gotten well under way. A detailed study of the life history and habits of this pest is being made and in addition 500 acres of peaches are being used to determine whether baited traps are of any value in its control. The traps are wide mouthed fruit jars of the quart size the mouth of which is cov - ered with hardware cloth to exclude large moths. Attached to the top of the jar Is a stiff wire hook for suspending the trap in the tree. The traps are baited with a sugar solution to which has been added a small amount of oil of geranium as an attraction. Each da) they are examined for moths. The past summer was very unfavorable for the moths. The favorite food material for the young worms is the peach and this </seg>

Furthermore the dry weather slowed up the twig growth to such an extent that the young worms that hatched out on the twigs found the going rather difficult. Unquestionably the number of over - wintering larvae was greatly reduced In this entire territory. In the meantime there has been a delay in working out some of the control measures. Up until now the only hope for control seems to be from parasites that destroy the larvae. * ■',■■ • - ■ v » '**''■,' ;.- ■■;-',.: ■ , ~0&amp; " ■•' --''^li^^H : ' ■ ■■'■ *"f* Cool air storage at the Simpson orchards, Vincennes, Indiana. Fruit growing is quite an important industry around Vincennes. Outstanding among the growers are the Simpsons, W. C. Reed and John Napier Dyer, who own and operate a total of about a thousand acres of peaches and early apples. At the time of our visit . the Yellow Transparents were practically all harvested and the growers were beginning to harvest the Duchess variety. The drouth was be - ginning to have its effect at this time on the size of the fruit. How - ever, this effect was much more noticeable the week following around Indianapolis and Columbus. Then too, the growers around Vincennes employ the most up to date orchard practices. The space between the trees was entirely free from weeds and the fruit had been thinned to insure size and quality. The growers In this territory seem to have worked up a fine trade in the larger markets like Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland, largely because of their quality pack. The lower grades are readily disposed of to truckers. The auto truck has certainly been a boon to direct buying. Mr. Dyer told of one grocery firm in Columbus 300 miles away, that regularly trucked apples from his packing house for their trade. The apples at the Dyer orchard are picked in bushel baskets or crates and run over ' a Georgia peach grader. Women do all of the packing. The lidding, however, is done by men. ■ This year he was </seg>

One practice that is always followed in this orchard is that the day's picking is always packed that same day and either stored in iced cars or in a cold storage plant, in the event that a market has not been previously found. This Insures the buyer of good condition upon arrryal at destination and the grower knows that he has done his best in assur - ing the buyer of a good product. At the Reed orchard a Cutler grader is used for sizing and the packed apples are placed in a cool air storage from where they are loaded directly into iced cars. From Vincennes we drove to Columbus, Ohio, where the meetings of the Cooperative Institute were in progress July 7 to July 12. I attended the meetings devoted to Fruits and "Vegetables during that week. A resume of what transpired was published in the Midwest Fruitman for the benefit of the members of the Society. Informal garden with pool at Ohio State University at Columbus, Ohio. The effects of the prolonged drought which this region had under gone was plainly evident. Corn was beginning to fire badly. The lawns were brown and the flower gardens on the campus of Ohio State University were suffering. Later on I received reports to the effect that orchardists were hauling water to their trees in an attempt to save them. Around Columbus there had been less than an inch of rain since the middle of March. </seg>
            <seg id="p569">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The Ohio Experimental Orchards are located at Wooster, about 80 miles northeast of Columbus.' This was our next stop. About 40 acres of the farm are devoted to orcharding. The general practice in the old orchard block is to. allow the blue grass to grow between the trees and to mow it about twice during the season. The trees in the block were dense enough and close enough to prevent a heavy &gt; growth of grass. With younger orchards aged 5 to 14 the common practice at the Station is to clean cultivate early in the season and about the middle of June to sow a cover crop of soy beans. Formal Hardens at Ohio State University. Perhaps the most interesting experiment being tried was the one where the apples were thinned in varying degrees. The one variety that seemed especially to need thinning was Grimes. One plat was left unthlrined, another thinned to 6 inches, another to 8, one to 10, and one to 12 inches. By that is meant that in the 8 inch block no two apples would be closer than 8 inches on the same limb. It looked as tho the trees thinned to 10 or 12 inches would produce fruit far superior to the blocks where no thinning was done and quite a lot better than where they were thinned to 6 inches. It is quite likely that the unusual drought interfered materially with normal growth of the fruit in these blocks. The trees also seemed to be wilting a great deal more than would have been the case in a normal season. The experiments indicated that in an unusually dry season much bet- </seg>
            <seg id="p570">REPORT OF NEURASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ter quality and size could be secured where the fruit was thinned than where normal over-production was permitted. A block of peaches adjoining the apples looked perfectly white. The guide said that experiments were under way in these blocks to determine whether the oriental fruit moth could be controlled by spraying with hydrated lime at the rate of about 10 pounds to 50 gallons of water. It was difficult to tell much about this experiment at this time because there were no peaches to be found. The trees had made a fair growth up to this time yet very little damage could be seen to the twigs. Evidently the weather was unfavorable for the insect. Quite a large plot of ground is being used to test out flowers of various sorts and varieties. Evidently there is an increasing interest in this phase of horticulture In Ohio as elsewhere. From Wooster we drove to Cleveland and then to Palnesville. The county in which Palnesville is situated boasts of the fact that' there is more nursery stock grown here than in any other county in the country. It certainly looked like there was more truth in It than in some boasts I've heard. Most of the plantings were ornamentals and evergreens formed quite a large part of them. One of the orchards I had been told to look up was located just beyond Palnesville It was operated by Mantle and Mantle. About 175 acres of orchard, mostly apples, is being operated by this firm. The location of this orchard is about a mile and a half from Lake Erie and this accounts for the fact that there was a good crop of peaches on the trees here, whereas farther south around Vincennes and thru southern Illinois, this crop was a total loss. A lake as large as Lake Erie seldom freezes over. As the winds from the west and north pass over the water, the air is gradually warmed up by the water. By the time the air reaches land it is perhaps 15 or 20 degrees warmer than when it left the land on the other side of the lake. •i To show me what this means in terms of crops, Mr. Mantle said that there was one block- of apples near the house about 60 years old that to his knowledge has not failed to produce a crop in the last 40 years. Land of this type is very high priced, however. There are summer homes scattered along the lake and re/al estate value must he paid for orchard land: That means $500 to $1,000 per acre. Furthermore, the land is in need of drainage. Up until this year a total of 27 miles of drain tile has been placed in jhls orchards and each year he aims to increase this by about 5 to 7 miles. It seemed rather odd to see orchardists putting in tile when the season was as dry as this one. But of course next year may be very wet and that is the time when the tile will be very useful for draining away the excess soil </seg>

The soil is of glacial origin and therefore rocky In auuio places on the same farm, sandy in others and a stiff clay in others. Each type must receive special type of treatment. Unless the orchard - ist gives attention to these needs there is little chance of success. Mr. Mantle showed me two blocks of orchard of about 12 years of age on similar soil. One of these belonged to him and the other to a neighbor who didn't understand orcharding. Mr. Mantle's block was at least again as large as was the adjoining block and it had produced four successive crops of apples, whereas the .other orchard had not yet produced a good crop. One other point was brought out at this place that was new to me. Every tree had around Its trunk a protect - ing layer of cinders to keep the mice from injuring the trees. The source of the cinders was a smelting plant located about a half mile from the orchard.

After leaving Hamilton and turning west toward Detroit, the type of farming is very similar to that in Wisconsin and Minnesota, grain, corn and hay. The next place of horticultural interest visited was the Farns - worth orchards at Waterville, Ohio, about 35 miles southwest of Toledo. By the time we reached Detroit (July 17) the hot dry spell had become well established thru this territory. The temperature was hovering around 100 degrees. The prevailing winds had changed from west to south and they were fully as hot and dry as tho they had come from the Kansas stubbleflelds.

Apples predominate, cherries are next and then prunes. The oldest plantings are of apples, the varieties being Baldwin, Jona - than, Grimes, Stayman, Yellow Transparent and Duchess. The usual practice in old orchards had been to let them stay in blue grass. But when there seemed to be no let-up to the drought, three caterpillar tractors were called into action. They were in service night and day for a period of 3 weeks. At the time I visited the orchards the ground was absolutely free from sod and weeds. Of course it took lots of work and undoubtedly it was of considerable benefit to the trees, especially those carrying a crop. It goes to show what can be done with modern machinery. This would have been almost an impos - sible feat with the old horse drawn tools. Here is an example of how dry it was in this territory last sum - mer and spring.

Yet here again we found men putting in tile in several different places. There were no peaches being grown at this time. The foreman who showed me around explained that peaches were grown for a number of years but that they were too uncertain and had been pulled out and replaced by sour cherries. Thinning is a common practice in this orchard with apples, es - pecially the early varieties, like Yellow Transparent. Furthermore, at harvest time from two to three pickings are made. The Yellow Transparents were being harvested right at this time. The size was much below normal on account of the drought. Each day during the harvest season a truckload Is sent to some large markets like Detroit, Toledo or Cleveland. In addition local sales are encouraged, espec - ially in the fall and early winter. An attractive sales room Is located adjoining the packing shed for the convenience of the buying public. There is plenty of parking space in front of the sales room and two drives to the main highway. Adjoining the packing shed on the west is a large alrcooled storage. The early apples are generally placed directly in this storage before grading and they are sprinkled lightly to- help keep them from shrivelling. Then the following mo'rntng they are graded and packed. The late apples are graded and packed and then placed in storage. . After leaving the Parnsworth orchards we spent 10 days in Wis - consin and Minnesota and then returned to Lincoln to find that it was still hot in Nebraska but that In general the crops looked far better here than in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana. The fruit trees had not suffered from drought as much either. The difference . can be easily explained when the soils are compared. Our soils here can with - stand drought much better because they are deeper as a rule, espec - ially is that true in the Loess soils along the Missouri River. </seg>

SWENK, Entomologist Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station* This paper continues for 1930 the annual reports on the life - history of the codling moth, as have been given previously for 1928 in the 1929 report of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society (pp. 31-49), and for 1929 in the 1930 report of the Society (pp. 27-46). It includes a summary of the principal meteorological conditions dur - ing the fall and winter of 1929 and on through the spring and sum - mer of 1930 that have influenced the life-cycle of the codling moth, and also a detailed report on the recorded life-history of the insect for 1930. Summary of 1930 Meteorological Conditions as Belated to the Codling Moth The total precipitation for the eight months, September, 1929, to April, 1930, inclusive, was 11.93 inches, which is slightly over the normal (11.37 inches). It was thus only slightly less than during the same period of the "wet" winter of 1928-29 (13.80 inches), which was highly favorable for the survival, early pupation and rapid de - velopment of the wintering codling moth larvae, and very much more than during the "dry" and unfavorable winter of 1927-28 (6.39 inches). The total precipitation for the first five months of 1930 was 7.58 Inches, which while 1.89 inches below the normal, was only .38 inch less than in 1929 and 2.21 inches greater than in 1928. In the crucial month of April the precipitation was 2.72 inqhes, as compared with 2.93 in 1929 and 1.18 in 1928. In the mean per cent of relative humidity, the first five months of 1930 were only very slightly less favorable for the development of this Insect than In 1929, the average being 56.7% for 1930 as compared to 57. 2% for 1929 and only 45% for 1928 (average normal 58%). Thus, from the standpoint of pre - cipitation and humidity the fall, winter and early spring period of 1929-30 was quite favorable to the survival and early development of the codling moth. Turning now to temperatures, we find the month of February, 1930, was the warmest ever recorded at the Lincoln station (covering 49 years), the mean temperature for the month being 41.6" F., as compared to 32.7" F. in 1928 and 19.2° F. in 1929, and 37° F. in the next warmest February (of 1926).

In 1928 and 42 6° F 1Q»« «A n . d^ PrtI mean temperature at 55.0° F. was higher than in ia^» (54.2 F.) and much higher than in 1928 (48.2° F.). As a result of these highly favorable conditions of high tempera - ture and ample moisture In the spring of 1930, there was an extremely early pupation and emergence of the spring brood of moths. The first wintering larvae pupated on April 15 in 1930, as compared to April 26 in 1929 and May 8 in 1928, and the first moth of the spring brood emerged on May 8 in 1930 as compared to May 19 in 1929 and May 23 in 1928. The month of May had an almost exactly normal mean temperature (61.4° P., with normal of 61.7° P.). which was slightly higher than In 1929 (60° F.) but distinctly lower than in 1928 (64.6° F.). This was accompanied by an exceedingly high mean per cent of relative humidity during May— 60% at noon— as compared to a normal of 50% and 51% in 1929 and only 40% in 1928. This in - fluenced a slower rate of pupal development in 1930 than in 1929 or 1928. Nevertheless, because of the very early start of the flight of spring-brood moths, egg-laying began about a month earlier than in 1929 or 1928; to be exact the first, eggs of the first brood were laid on May 19, as compared to June 13 in 1929 and June 15 in 1928. The earlier eggs laid in our rearing cages were infertile how - ever, and the first eggs that hatched were laid on June 1. These hatched on June 12, which marks the proper time for the beginning of the first "cover" spray, nine days earlier than the first hatching in 1929 (June 21) and eleven days earlier than the computed first hatch - ing in 1928 (June 23). The last first-brood larva hatched out July 1, as compared to July 2 in 1928 and July 12 in 1929. The first pupa of the first brood was found on June 27 (July 3 in both 1928 and 1929) and the last first-brood pupa to change to the moth was on August 24 (September 3 in 1929 and September 7 in 1928). From this it will be seen that the unusually prolonged pupal period of the first brood extended chiefly through late June, July and most of Aug - ust. The first first-brood moths emerged on July 7 as compared to July 13 In 1928 and 1929, and their flight ended on September 14 as compared to September 23 in 1929 and September 25 in 1928. The first generation of 1930 ran consistently a week or 10 days earlier than the corresponding. generation of either 1928 or 1929. July of 1930 was a terrifically hot and dry month. The mean temperature at Lincoln was. 82.8° F. (normal 76.5° F.), with maxima running from 100° F. to 108° F. on thirteen days of the month; this as compared to a mean temperature of 77.4° F. in 1929 and 77.0° F. in 1928, with a temperature of 100° F. or over occuring only once (101° F. on July 6, 1928). At the same time the mean relative hu - midity at noon in July. 1930, was only 37% (normal 48%), as com- </seg>
            <seg id="p578">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pared to 519S- in 1928 and 52% in 1929. These very high temperatures and very low humidities of July, 1930, had a severely unfavorable effect on the hatching of the second-brood eggs. Second-brood eggs were first laid on July 11 (as compared to July 16 in 1929 and July 21 In 1928), and the last ones hatched on September 10 (as compared to September 6 in 1929 and September 10 in 1928). But the hot. dry July caused a low hatch of second-brood eggs. Of 3,412 eggs observed In the insectary, only 405, or 11.87 per cent, hatched. This resulted in a weak second brood of codling moth larvae. The first second-brood larvae hatched on July 20, very close to the hatching of the first second-brood larvae on July 22 in 1929 and on July 27 in 1928. If a second brood cover spray had been necessary in 1930, the application should have been started beginning about July 20. The weather of August and September was. about normal in 1930, so far as temperature was concerned. The August mean tem - perature was 77.2° F. in 1930 as compared to 76.7° F. in 1929 and 76.2° F. In 1928 (normal 74.4° F.). The September mean tempera - ture was 68° F. In 1930 as compared to 64.6° F. in both 1929 and 1928 (normal 66.4° F.). The pupal period of the weak second brood In 1930 was short — August 12 to September 5 — as compared to Aug - ust 15 to September 24 In 1929 and August 14 to September 30 in 1928. Second-brood moths were flying in 1930 from August 24 to September 22, as compared with August 25 to October 16 in 1929 and September 9 to October 10 In 1928. Eggs of the third or wintering brood, which was (as usual) very weak in 1930, were, present from September 2 to 20. In 1929 these were present from September 1 to October 1, and in 1928 from Sep - tember 18 to October 15. The Record for 1930 A number of wintering larvae were collected from under bands in the Agricultural College orchard at Lincoln during the early part of April, 1930. These were placed in the usual cocooning racks and kept in glass jars in the out-of-doors insectary in the Agricultural College orchard, under temperature conditions as nearly similar as possible to those in the adjoining orchard, and were examined daily for pupation. As previously mentioned, the first pupation occurred on April 15, when two of the larvae pupated, this being 15 days earlier than in 1929 and 24 days earlier than in 1928. - Other pupa - tions followed daily on the next five days, and on each day thereafter, except on April 21, 23, 24, 26, 27 and 29 and May 15, 17, 18, 29 and 30, until May 31. Five larvae pupated on June 2, 7 and 11, the latter date marking the final pupation. The crest of pupation occurred on May 5, which was 18 days earlier than the pupation crest in 1929 and 19 days earlier than In 1928. On this early crest date of 1930 (May 5), 79, or 54.8 per cent of the whole, had pupated, as com - pared to 50.1 per cent on the crest date of 1929 (May 23) and 89.4 </seg>
            <seg id="p579">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY per cent on the crest date of 192 8 (May 24). The pupation period in the Insect ary covered 57 days, as compared with 39 days in 1929 and 28 days in 1928. The last pupa gave up its moth on June 24, making a pupal period of 70 days, as compared to 62 days in 1929 and 45 days in 1928.

The longer pupal period of 1930 is attributed to the lower temperatures and higher relative humidity of May, as compared to 1928, and to the higher relative humidity as compared to 1929. It took 25 days for about one-half (45.1 per cent) of the pupae to complete this stage, whereas in 1929 nearly one-half (42.6 per cent) completed that stage in 17 or 18 days, and in 1928 about one-half (52.3 per cent) completed it in 21 or 22 days.

As previously mentioned, this is 11 days earlier than in 1929 and 15 days earlier than in 1928. The last moth of this brood emerged in the Insectary on June 24, forming a total emergence per - iod of 47 days, as compared to 39 days (35 in the' insectary) in 1929, and ,30 days (26 in the insectary) in 1928. The longer emergence period is due largely to its much earlier beginning, its close on June 24 tallying closely with the close of June 22 in 1928 and June 27 in 1929. The height of the emergence occurred on May 31, when 20 moths emerged.

Sixty-one of these were male moths and 72 were female moths. The length of life of the moths, considering both sexes together, varied from 1 day to 30 days. The average length of life of the male moths was 15.10 days, of the female moths slightly more, 15.75 days, and of all moths 15.38 days.

            <seg id="p584">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In Table 5 are shown In detail the observations of the o.vipositlon of 72 female codling moths of the spring brood which were confined with 61 male moths in 32 cages. The first date of ovlposition was May 19, which, as has already been mentioned, is 25- days earlier than in 1929 (June 13) and 34 days earlier than in 1928 (June 22). The last day of oviposition was July 1, which corresponds very closely with July 2 in 1928 and July 4 in 1929. A total of 556 eggs were de - posited. The average number of days before oviposition was 6.2, the number varying from 1 to 11 days. This is a shorter preoviposition period than that obtained in 1929 (6.9 days), and distinctly shorter than that obtained in 1928 (9.5 days). The average number of days of oviposition was 6.6 (the minimum being 0 and the maximum 17 days), which also averages distinctly shorter than this period for 1928 (7.4 days) or for 1929 (7.7 days). The average number of days from date of emergence to last oviposition was 11.7, with the minimum 6 and the maximum 20, which compares with an average of 13.8 days in 1929 and 16 days In 1928. It is believed that these shortened preoviposition and oviposition periods were due to the very hot and dry character of July of 1930. Of these 556 eggs deposited between May 19 and July 1, 502 were laid on leaves, and an effort was made to hatch them. Of these, 274 eggs, deposited between June 1 and 24, hatched between June 12 and July 1. The hatching per cent of the first-brood eggs in 1930 was 54.78 per cent; this compares with 52.19 per cent in 1928 and 22.12 per cent in 1929. Egg-laying was at its height on June 12, which is 9 days earlier than the crest of egg-laying in 1928 (June 21). and 13 days earlier than the crest of egg-laying In 1929 (June 25). The incubation period of these 274 eggs varied from 7 to 11 days, with an average of 8.59 days, which corresponds closely to the average incubation period in 1928 (8.53 days), but is a little longer than the average incubation period in 1929 (7.58 days). The first observed hatching was on June 12, which corresponds with June 21 for 1929 and June 28 for 1928, and marks the correct date for the starting of the first cover spray in 1930. The details of these observations are shown in the following table: </seg>

Of these, 85 died In the larval stage, without pupating, and 10 entered dormancy, leaving 244 first-brood larvae to pupate and transform to moths. The first pupation among these first-brood larvae, as has been stated, occurred on June 27, when one larva pupated. This is a week earlier than the first pupation in 1928 or 1929 (July 3 in both years). The high points of pupation were July 5 and 15, on which days 23 larvae pupated, the last-mentioned date representing the true crest of pupation, however, because the number ' pupating on July 4 to 6 was 49 as compared to 57 on July 14 to 16. This crest of pupation (July 15) compares to July 6 In 1929 and July 17 in 1928. On the crest date in 1930, 69.46 per cent of the first-brood larvae had pupated, as compared to 41 per cent in 1928 and 48.57 per cent in 1929. The last of the 244 first-brood larvae to pupate did so on August 9. The entire pupation period covered 45 days in 1930, as compared to 57 days in 1928 and 22 days in 1929.

            <seg id="p588">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE • The first moth of the first brood emerged from among the 244 flrst-brood pupae under observation on July 7, which coincides exactly with the date of the death of the last spring-brood moth. This is 6 days earlier than the first emergence of first-brood moths in 1928 or 1929 (July 13). The height of emergence took place on July 15 as compared to July 18 In 1929 and July 28 in 1928. On July 30, 90.57 per cent of the flrst-brood moths had emerged, which about parallels 90.7 per cent on July 30, 1929, and 87 per cent on August 11, 1928. As in 1929, there was no prolonged residual emergence by this brood in 1930, the last emergence taking place on August 24 13 days later than in 1929 (August 11), but 14 days earlier than in 1928 (September 7). The flight period of the first brood in 1930 (July 7 — September 14), thus began and ended about a week earlier than in 1929 (July 13— September 23) or 1928 (July 13— September 25).

            <seg id="p591">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Of the 4,287 second-brood eggs deposited between July li ana September 5, 3,412 were laid upon leaves and an effort was made to hatch them. Exactly 500 of this number started embryonic develop - ment, of which number 95 failed to hatch, making a total of 405 eggs hatching. This represents a very high mortality of second-brood eggs, amounting to 88.13 per cent, due to the very high temperatures and very low humidities prevailing during the chief hatching period of the eggs — the last half of July and the first half of August. It compares with a mortality of 49.94 per cent (396 out of 793 eggs) in 1929 and of only 36.92 per cent (79 out of 214) in 1928. The average incuba - tion period was 6.43 days (compared with 5.81 days in 1929 and 5.96 days in 1928), which was a little over 2 days shorter than the average incubation period of the eggs of the first brood. The first second-brood larva hatched on July 20, as has been mentioned, which was very close to the hatching date of the first second-brood larvae on July 22 in 1929 and July 27 in 1928. The 405 eggs hatched between July 20 and September 10. The crest of the hatching was on July 26 (as compared to July 25 in 19J29 and August 8 in 1928). The details of these observations are shown in table No. 12. Although a considerable number of second-brood larvae were collected under bands at Lincoln, August 9 to 20, and observed closely for pupation, only 4 of them pupated, and of the nearly 400 larvae reared in the insectary only one pupated, the remainder entering the winter untransformed. The 5 second-brood larvae that pupated did so August 12, 15, 19 and 23, and had a pupal period of 11 (1), 12 (2) or 13 (2) days, as shown In table No. 13. </seg>

            <seg id="p595">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY THE CONTROL OF THE SHOT HOLE DISEASE OF CHERRIES DR. R. W. GOSS*. This disease is also known by other common names such as leaf spot, and yellow leaf. The different names refer to different symp - toms produced by the disease. This disease is not a new one in Nebraska, as it was reported to be severe here back as far as. 1900. Severe losses were reported in Nebraska nurseries in 1903 and in 1906 when one nursery was reported to have lost 40,000 trees.' The disease is common in most sections of the United States where cher - ries are grown. It occurs on both sour and sweet cherries, and is similar to the leaf spot caused by a closely related organism occurring on certain wild hosts, such as wild black cherries, choke cherries, and bird cherries, but it has been found that the disease is not trans - ferred from the wild hosts to the cultivated cherries. Symptoms: The disease directly affects only the foliage of the cherry tree. The first symptom is the appearance of small purple or reddish circular spots on the leaves which later enlarge slightly and turn brown. Sometimes the dead, brown tissue within the spot be - comes separated from the rest of the leaf and drops out, giving the leaf its characteristic shot-hole effect. At other times infected leaves turn yellow and drop to the ground, resulting in the severe defolia - tion of trees that is so characteristic of the disease. This yellowing does not seem to be dependent upon the number of spots on the leaf. The disease indirectly affects both the amount and size of the fruit and the vitality of the tree, as a result of the spotting of the foliage and the dropping of the leaves. Such weakened trees are also more susceptible to winter injury. This effect of defoliation has been studied at the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station. Briefly summarized, they found that as a result of severe defoliation there was a delay in blooming the following year by 3 or 4 days and smaller sized buds and blossoms were produced. They found an 18 per cent loss of fruit spurs and a similar loss of shoots. There was- a 12 per cent reduction in size of fruits and a 50 per cent reduction in the number of fruits, causing a greatly reduced yield from defoliated trees. In addition, the year following defoliation the lateral buds were greatly reduced, and as a result few new spurs were formed the following year. Life History: The life history of the disease is quite similar to that of apple scab. The fungus causing the disease lives over winter in the infected spots on the leaves which have dropped to the ground. In the spring, during periods of warm, wet weather, spores are formed in the'se spots and are forcibly ejected Into the air where they are carried by wind currents to the young leaves of the tree. These spores, falling on the leaves in the presence of moisture, germinate, pene - * The experimental spray work mentioned here was carried on by W. W. Yocum of the Horticultural Department, and E. H. Hoppert of the Agricultural Extension Division. </seg>

During rainy weather these spores are scattered and repeated infections thruput the sum - mer can be caused in this way. It is evident from this brief review of the life history that in order to control the disease it is necessary to prevent the early infec - tion in the spring, which, if it once gains a foothold, will spread very rapidly under favorable weather conditions. Sanitary practices which remove or plow under the infected leaves on the ground serve as one means of lessening the amount of spring infection, but they will not entirely control the disease. It is more feasible to attempt control by the use of sprays. Review of Spraying Experiments in Other States: I. might briefly review some of the work done in other states in attempts to control this disease. In Michigan they report that the disease can be con - trolled by the application of 4 lime-sulphur sprays. They report that colloidal sulphur gives poor control, and that Pyrox and Bordeaux caused foliage injury, especially when the lime-sulphur spray was fol - lowed by an application of Bordeaux. Spraying experiments in Ohio gave somewhat similar results. They found that Bordeaux caused severe injury, while lime-sulphur controlled the disease satisfactorily without injury. In both Ohio and Michigan they recommend the first spray to be applied at petal fall, and in Ohio they obtained the best results by spraying at intervals of 2 to 3 weeks thruout the summer using as many as 5 to 7 sprays. Ohio also reported that the sprays could be timed according to the production of spores and the weather conditions, so that the number of sprays could be reduced. In Wisconsin they found that occasionally infection occurred in the young leaves and bud scales before blossoming, altho the critical per - iod was found to be 14 3ays after petal fall or just before the second spray. They found considerable variation in the injury caused by I'ordeaux and its effect on the yield of fruit the following year. They obtained better results with 3-3-50 Bordeaux than with lime-sulphur in that the disease was controlled with 3 sprays of Bordeaux, whereas 4 sprays of lime-sulphur were necessary due to the fact that Bordeaux has a longer Voration of effectiveness. They obtained poor control with sulphur dust and dry-mix lime-sulphur. Ohio also reported poor control with the mild forms of sulphur and sulphur dust. Wisconsin recommends time of application somewhat similar to that of Ohio and Michigan. Nebraska Spray-ing Tests in 1920 and 1930: With the increasing number of cherry trees planted in southeastern Nebraska, the occur - rence of this disease has become a major factor in cherry production, and it was found advisable two years ago .to start experiments in an attempt to determine the kind of spray, the number of sprays, and the time of application that would best control the disease under our conditions. As previously stated, the weather conditions have a great </seg>
            <seg id="p597">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY effect on the occurrence of this disease. It is favored by warm, wet weather and checked by dry periods or by cold weather. It would be expected, then, that results regarding the time and number of appli - cations of sprays would vary somewhat from year to year and that experiments to determine these points would have to be conducted a number of years. While we only have data on these tests for 2 years, there are certain points that have been brought out which seem worthy of consideration at this time. These spraying tests have been conducted in an orchard located near Nebraska City, the orchard containing 700 to 800 trees in rows of 35 trees. These rows were divided up into 2 and 4 row blocks for each spray test. One row thru the center of the orchard was left unsprayed as a check. One-half of the orchard was Early Richmond and the other half Montmorency. The spray tests were duplicated with each variety, but the results have been quite similar with both varieties, so that for the purpose of the present discussion they are averaged together. In order to obtain accurate readings on the per - centage of infection, 4 trees were selected in each spray block and 2 branches on each of these trees were marked early in the season. At certain intervals the number of leaves on these branches were counted, also the number of Infected leaves and the severity of Infection. This was thought to be a more accurate method of estimating the amount of Infection than simply making a count on random samples. The sprays will be referred to by number, the first spray being that applied at the time of petal fall, the second spray 10 days to 2 weeks later, or at about the time the shucks drop. The third spray was applied about two weeks later or about two weeks before har - vest, depending, of course, on the variety. The fourth spray was applied just after harvest. Table 1 shows the amount of infection and the extent of defolia - tion in the spray tests for 1929. Table 2 shows the amount of infec - tion for 1930. The percentages are based upon counts of 1,000 to 2,000 leaves in each spray block. Table 3 presents the monthly mean temperatures and rainfall during the same months for both years. In 1929 weather conditions during May we're quite favorable for the spread of the disease. Examination of infected leaves on the ground showed that mature spores were ready to be disseminated about May 9th. The experiment in 1929 was started rather late and the first spray was omitted. As a result extensive infection occurred during the latter half of May,- which was evident at the time readings were made on June 5, as shown In Table 1, the unsprayed check having slightly more than 60 per cent of the leaves infected at that time. During June the weather conditions continued to be very favorable for the spread of the disease and the percentage of infection increased. As shown in the table, the amount of infection in the unsprayed plots and in the plot where the first and second sprays were omitted was slightly greater than In the two plots receiving the second spray.

            <seg id="p600">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY conditions were extremely favorable for the spread of the disease, due to abundant rains which were 8 to 9 inches more than normal. These conditions, combined with the early infection resulting from the omis - sion of the first spray, tended to obscure any differences resulting from the different spray applications, and the high amount of infection in all the plots resulted in extreme defoliation, as shown in Table 1. The extent of defoliation is Indicated in the table by the percentage of leaves remaining on the tree, using the highest number occurring at any time during the summer on the marked branches as 100 per cent. The greatest number occurred on June 4. One week later de - foliation had started, and, as shown in the table, the unsprayed plot and the plot with the first and second sprays omitted had the greatest amount of early defoliation. During the wet weather of July, defolia - tion was so severe that by August less than 10 per cent of the leaves were left on the tree, except in the plot receiving 3 sprays, where about 25 per cent of the leaves were left. It must be remembered, of course, that new leaves were being formed on these branches thru - out the summer, so that the actual leaf dropping was even greater than indicated in the table. In 1930 the weather conditions in May and June were quite sim - ilar to those occurring in 1929. The application of the first spray at the time of petal-drop controlled the disease quite well as compared with the previous year. During the month of June the amount of infection steadily increased on the unsprayed checks and the leaves started to turn yellow in the latter part of June. During July condi - tions were exactly opposite to those occurring in 1929, as the tem - perature was extremely high and the rainfall was deficient. As a result, we have a natural control of the disease which is clearly shown in Table 2 for the month of July. During August the weather was more, favorable for spread and the amount of infection increased In direct proportion to the amount that was present in June and July. Table 2. 1030 Spray Tests.

            <seg id="p602">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In this year, due to the natural control of the disease in July by un - favorable weather conditions, no differences could be observed be - tween the different spray schedules. The results with all four sprays were no better than with any of the four combinations of three sprays, altho all spray blocks were much better than the checks. Defoliation was not severe as compared with 1929, only 10 to 20 per cent of the infected leaves dropping. In addition to the difference in the extent of infection between the sprayed and unsprayed blocks, there was also a difference in the severity. About 11 per cent of the infected leaves in the sprayed blocks were listed as severe, that is, more than 10 spots per leaf, whereas 22 per cent of the infected leaves on the checks were severe. Yellowing was only severe in the check block. It should be mentioned that in 1929 a dry mix lime-sulphur was used, whereas in 1930 commercial liquid lime-sulphur was applied. Because of the fact that such poor control was obtained in 1929, an additional test was run in 1930 comparing the dry mix lime-sulphur with the liquid lime-sulphur. There was no difference in the amount of infection obtained. It is possible, however, that In a more favor - able year for the spread of the disease, differences might be obtained similar to to the results reported from Wisconsin. In certain blocks Bordeaux mixture was substituted for lime-sulphur in the fourth spray. The percentage of lime used in making the spray was apparently too low, and severe injury with yellowing of the foliage and leaf dropping occurred in these plots. Table 3.

It is evident, however, from the 1929 test that the first spray at petal fall is essential. It is also evident from the 1930 test that the efficacy of the fourth spray applied after harvest will depend greatly on weather conditions. That Is, during long periods of hot, dry weather, such as occurred in 1930, this spray could prob - ably be safely omitted. We would recommend that as a usual prac - tice four sprays of standard lime-sulphur be applied, the first one at about the time of petal fall, the second one 10 days to 2 weeks later, the third one about 2 weeks later, and the fourth one after harvest. </seg>

WEBER, Presiding INSPECTION OF SHEEP LOTS The program opened with an inspection or the sheep barns and lots on the agricultural college campus. Mr. Weber explained the experiments in progress and gave the results up to date. The group then assembled at the Judging Pavilion for the remainder of the morning. MR. WEBER: We'll pass around some of these registration cards and if you have questions on any sheep subject, write them on these cards. This afternoon during the question box period, we will try to take those up and find experts to answer them. We don't want to be like one old fellow who got his metaphors mixed a little. He said an expert was a hole in the doughnut. Now, we don't want to be like that. Anyway, these cards will be passed around and we will be glad to have you ask any questions that you care to. The first talk on the program will be by Mr. Ed Janike, a good - looking chap In the extension service. He Is looking after the animal husbandry club work. Mr. Janike will talk on "4-H Sheep Clubs." Mr. Janike. 4-H SHEEP CLUBS IN NEBRASKA ED JANIKE Mr. Chairman, Friends: I am reminded of one little story about Dad that happened not long ago. He was sitting in the house reading when Mrs. Weber answered the doorbell. She said, "Dad, there's a fellow out here with old clothes." Dad said, "Tell him I don't need any." Today that seems to be the tale of a lot of college professors. " I am supposed to say a few words about sheep clubs this morning. During the past few years Interest In 4-H clubs along animal husbandry lines has centered around baby beef and pig clubs. Sheep club work has been neglected. Nebraska ranks second as a sheep feeding state. During 192!) over 1% million lambs were shipped from western ranges to Ne - braska feed lots. About 7% of this number are produced here. Some say It is not practical to encourage production of sheep because the country is suffering from over production. There is another side to look at. The maintenance of a small farm flock for utilizing waste land, cleaning up fence rows, and de - stroying weeds can be done profitably. ' . .--■ i, I </seg>
            <seg id="p608">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Michigan has carried on considerable sheep club work as well as several of our nearer states including Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Colorado. Colorado's sheep club work is gaining in popularity and is coming up with their calf club work. In several districts it has had a decided effect on the improvement of existing farm flocks. The experience in managing a small farm flock will be of great value to the boy who later on decides to produce' and feed sheep on a larger scale. The necessary equipment and beginning capital are moderate and within the means of the average farm boy or girl. The present plan of sheep club work for the first year is known as a lamb club. The boy or girl procures a lamb at weaning time before May 1st and cares for and keeps records on the lamb for 100 days. The project is ended by exhibiting at a local or state fair. If it is a wether lamb, it. is sold; and if a ewe lamb, the club member has the option of either selling or keeping her for a ewe and lamb club. This year there were six lambs exhibited at the State Fair. It seems that to be in harmony with Nebraska conditions and to pro - mote the idea of developing a farm flock, this plan of work should be changed. A ewe and lamb club started in the fall, preferably during the month of September, would be more logical. Ewes can be pro - cured more readily at this time and when purchased can be kept on meadows, grain stubble fields, or late sown forage crops to get them in good condition for breeding. Experience with ewes through fall and winter will also render a beginner more capable of attending to them at lambing time. It is more difficult to buy bred ewes in the spring at a reasonable price. Perhaps eight or ten club members could go together and pur - chase a purebred mutton type ram for breeding purposes. All ram lambs should be castrated and fed for market. In most cases, lambs are most profitable if made ready for market when about four or five months old, when weighing 65 to 75 pounds. These lambs could be creep fed and marketed before July 1st. The best ewe lambs could be kept to increase the flock. The ultimate aim in promoting a project of this type is to train our future farmers in the care and management of a farm flock of sheep. Several pig club boys have developed herds that have proved an asset to the state. They know the proper methods ot sanitation used to prevent disease. This sheep club project offers a means of developing flocks free from diseases and pests that offer a lot of trouble to sheep raisers today. If any of you are interested in organizing a club in your locality this coming fall, we will be glad to help you. You may get in touch with your county extension agent, or If you do not have an agent In your county, you may write to the state club office direct. </seg>
            <seg id="p609">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION MR. WEBER: You will be Interested In a clipping thai mr. Smith from Weeping Water just handed me. His boy was in the sheep club last year. His lambs didn't get in the money at Omaha, but still they have a pretty good story to tell. They cost 10c June 1. and sold for 15c at Omaha. They made more than one might ordi - narily expect. At the same time last June, he purchased two regis - tered Hampshire ewe lambs. He had four lambs which cost $52.00. The feed cost from June 1 to November 1 amounted to $10.40. The total cost was $62.40. The sale of two wethers at $30.00 each plus prize moneys at state and county fairs netted him $64.50, represent - ing a net gain of $2.10 plus two good registered Hampshire ewes and a "worth of experience." Mr. Smith is proud of his boy and I want to say this. He happened to get the lambs from the college and Mr. Smith said he would do certain things if those lambs won at the fair. I almost got sick smoking the cigars he gave me. The next speaker on our program is a man who has had a great deal of practical experience feeding lambs, handling ewe flocks, and western ewes. He is a man who has had a lot of practical experience in connection with the new marketing plan for wool. Mr. Ross is president and' general manager of the Midwest Wool Marketing Asso - ciation and we are very happy indeed to have Mr. Ross with us today. He will speak on "Farm Flock A-B-C's. Mr. Ross. FARM FliOCK A-B-C's W. MARSHALL ROSS I am glad to meet you men here today and talk to you in my homely way; it's just farmer talk and when I get through you will realize that I am no orator. I am glad to talk on the subject, because the subject of sheep right now is one that is attracting the attention of a good many people — even those not in the sheep business. The year of 1930 has been disastrous and disappointing to almost every sheep grower in Nebraska. We have had more disappointments than we have had in the last twelve or fifteen years in the handling of our sheep and lambs, especially in the commercial end of it. The com - mercial feeding has taken a large toll In the sheep for this year. We are looking forward to 1931 and hoping that we may have a better year, and I believe that we have some bright prospects ahead of us; although nothing like we had during the war period and after the war, I do think that we are on a basis now where we are going to derive a little profit from the raising and marketing of our sheep. Wool is just about as low as it possibly can be and lambs have been low. You will note that during the first ten months of 1930 there were somewhere near 2,192,000 more lambs marketed than during the first </seg>
            <seg id="p610">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ten months of 1929. I do not have figures on the last two months of 1930, but by watching the records of the different sheep at the different markets we could see that there were several thousand more lambs marketed each week than there were in the year 1929, so that the consumption of lamb may run to almost 3,000,000 lambs more during 1930 than 1929, at least 2,500,000 more. This is cleaning up the surplus of lamb much faster than we expected. I just thought I would tell you about this before I started in. I am supposed to talk about the A B C's of farm flocks. Then, getting to the point of a farm flock and the chances for profit in a farm flock. I think that only those who have small farm flocks realize how much of a benefit the farm flock is to the farm and the owner. We think .sheep are very low, but you know that feed is very low, that good breeding stock is very low, so I think that the man who is ready to take on a small farm flock has just as much chance for a profit as the man who took them on a few years ago. A good high - grade bunch of ewes will probably be the necessary thing to start in with, but the chances are they would cost you a great deal more money. If you could buy a good bunch of full blooded ewes to establish a farm flock, it would be a short cut to profit and to pleasure also; but, for the ordinary fellow not wanting to put very much money in the establishing of a farm flock, we consider that the good western ewes, two to three-year-olds, or even old ewes, are very good to start farm flocks, always keeping in mind that you want to use a good regis - tered mutton ram of the type and of the breed that you admire. Myself, I especially admire the black-faced breeds. Of the others, 1 do not know which I admire more. There is not a great deal of difference in them. The Southdown has the preferred carcass from the packers' standpoint, but from the farmer's standpoint, they are just a little small to get the growth and gain on them that we sometimes like. Some of the larger types of black-faced rams and ewes are preferable from the farmer's standpoint. You take and buy these western ewes — at the present price of old ewes, 1 think it would be preferable to buy younger ewes. You have to get a bunch of ewes that will last until the ewe lambs come on and you can establish your flocks from them. When you take a good registered ram and put on these western ewes — and, of course, you know that they have quite a bit of good blood .incorporated in them — It doesn't take long to see that you have the type of the rams in the lambs. The second cross will almost put the pure breed type on the lambs. After you have your second cross from these western ewes, you have ewes that compare very favorably to many high-grade mutton ewes — Shropshire, Hampshire, Oxforfi, and. that kind. They haven't got the breeding strength that the purebreds have. I have seen flocks from three to four crosses that I doubt whether anyone could tell from a purebred flock. They, establish their type very </seg>

The ewe lambs can be saved from these ewes and in a snon time', as the ewes are ready for market In two years, you can have a type of ewes from these western ewes and dispose of the old ewes. So, consequently, you have gotten into your Hock very cheap. ; I did know of one flock of yearling ewes that were very good type ; | of ewe. They were raised in southern Idaho and they sold for 6 '4 c per pound and weighed 78 pounds. You can see that for around $5 to J5.50 per ewe you could have a very good set of young western ewes with size. It is preferable to get a little older ewe for the amateur to begin with. They are much easier to lamb out, death loss is less, they require less time at lambing time, and are a little bit more desirable unless you have had experience in lambing young ewes. At the time you get these ewes, it is very desirable that you have some good pasture or some good rich feed of some kind to flush the ewes out at breeding time. Get them in condition to bring forth as many twin lambs as possible and have each one bring one lamb. Put them on fresh pasture two to three weeks before lambing time. 1 think a man with a small farm flock should have a house to put them in In winter time. He doesn't need an expensive house — just an in - expensive one made so that the wind can't blow through. Also, he should plan to breed his ewes early and get the lambs on the early market. It is generally preferable that ewes be bred not later than the first of October. That brings the lambs about the first of March. If the ewe is bred the first of September, you get the lambs the first of February. If you have March lambs, you can get them on the early market. We all know that the early market is the best. In May and June there are less lambs going on the market than at any time during the year. You can get a getter price for them then. There is another reason for getting them on the early market, too. That is, there are very few lambs that make much gain in Nebraska during the months of July and August. If you can, have most of the ewes lamb early enough to get the lambs on the market not later than the first of July. You will find you will have very much more profit than if you carry them on into the fall. Because of the heat and flies, it seems that the lambs not marketed before then do not make any gains in July and August. That is in this part of the state. They might make some gain in the northern part of the state. It has been our experience that later lambs do no good in July and August. There is no reason why a farmer with a small flock can't get hiH lambs oft early. We lambed ewes for several years commencing the tenth of February, and we had quite a number of ewes too — 1,000 to 1,200. The first 250 lambs that came we put in the barn together. We got thoao lambs off the tenth of May weighing around 63 pounds. They were profitable because it didn't take long to get them on the market. </seg>
            <seg id="p612">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The tail end of the lambs we had to carry over during the summer and they really didn't make any money. The first part of the flock made the money, and there is no reason why this can't be done, especially when trucks are available -for trucking to market and you are so close to Omaha. If you have a pen of early lambs, send them in and shoot the rest not later than the first of July. Get the. lambs off at the weight of about 70 or 75 pounds. How are we going to get these ready for market? How will we feed them and the ewes? In the beginning, we want to flush our ewes. When they do not have good pasture and good alfalfa, they need a little grain once a day. If they are young ewes, I don't know that it is necessary. We have forty ewes and a few lambs with them, and twenty-five acres of alfalfa. After the frost there was no danger of bloat from eating first and second-cutting alfalfa. We turned the ewes in on this and they have been running there without any grain for probably forty or fifty days. I was looking at them yesterday and you couldn't desire to see ewes in any better condition than they were. Before lambing them we will begin to give them a little bit of grain, getting them ready to produce lambs. I think we will find those ewes will do very well. If you were to run them in corn stalks, I think it is very desirable that they have a little oil meal along with this feed. Possibly some oats and barley and a little oil meal, or if you have good alfalfa or clover hay, that is all right. The idea is to keep these ewes thriving and keep them in thrifty condition until they begin to lamb — not putting too much expense in the grain, possible one-fourth pound per day to ewes that are from two to five years old. Older ewes possibly have to have a little more grain, as their teeth are Hhort and their grinders are not so good. They can't masticate the hay unless it is ground. One year I thought I would try running these ewes like they do in the West. We rented a pretty good range and ranged them up and down the river. We had good blue grass and this makes fine pasture. We tried feeding shelled corn on this. We didn't have the success that we did when we fed a little more ground, feed and alfalfa. These were old ewes with their teeth practically gone in front. They were what you would call gummers. If these ewes are well taken care of, they are going to be ready to give plenty of milk when the lambs come. Just as soon as the lamb is two to three weeks old, it should be castrated and docked. Now this should be done when the animal is very young. A young animal won't bleed so much. We have never had very serious results. We just use a knife and have never had any trouble. A creep should be arranged where the lambs can get to it handily. Put it some place where the lambs are running in and out, not back </seg>
            <seg id="p613">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION in a dark corner, but where the lambs are going to pass. A lamb lias the idea that he likes to get through a crack. He will run in this creep and if you have feed in the trough, it isn't going to be but just a few weeks until the lambs are going to be eating con - siderable grain. We have had lambs at eight weeks old eating one pound of cracked corn and oil meal per day. When they do this with plenty of milk from the ewe, you will find that at 90 to 100 days the lambs will be right around 75 pounds. I do not think on farm flocks it Is the thing to try to carry these lambs through the fall and make fat lambs. Make milk lambs and put them on the market. This leaves the pasture for the ewes and gives you a chance to get them ready tor market. It is easy to get ewes to breed for January lambing. When you get January and February lambs, It is easy to get them on the early market. If you can Just get a ram dry he will stand as much as a ewe will. It. does take a little more time to lamb these ewes out in cold weather. We have never had much trouble. We put the ewes in a shed at night and leave the front doors open. The lambs come in there without any trouble. We have had a few lambs chilling, but in ordinary weather up to zero and 5 below you won't have much trouble if you have them In a flat roofed shed. We have a shed about nine feet at the back and ten feet at the front. There is a slope which holds the heat down. Put plenty of straw in there and you won't have trouble in lambing ewes out. I think the farmer with 15 or 25, or even 50 ewes if he has room for that many and if he has his fields fenced off, can carry ewes with very little cost. A flock of sheep on a farm is a great help. They will clean the fences out, keep the weeds out from under it, and (. keep the weeds out of the yard. Possibly most of you have noticed along the highway where there is a small flock of sheep the yards are always clean. Now, they almost earn their way just that way, bu( with the price of feed as low as* It Is now — hay half what It was last year, corn 40c to 50c per bushel, barley selling for 30c to 35c, and oats worth hardly anything — I can't see but what a small flock of ewes for the farm will pay bigger dividends than anything else that you can possibly have on the farm. I might speak a word for the cooperative marketing of wool while I am here. I have some bulletins that we got out the first of December. If- there is anyone here who would like one of these, just come forward, or we could pass them out. If you want one of them, you can get It as you go out. I think you will flnd them very interesting. The whole set-up of the wool cooperative move - ment is in there and it Is explained for you, also a statement regard - ing what they have done this year. I will say this much — the Na - tional Organization has handled and will handle over 140 million </seg>
            <seg id="p614">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pounds of wool, which is two-fifths of the wool In the United States. We find that we are getting just a little better price than we would in the old way and it is making a good safe way to market the wool. We are very proud of the record that the Midwest has made. The association comprises five states — Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and northern Texas. We have handled one-fourth of the wool in the five states. The most of our members are very well satisfied. The most of them feel that they have gotten more than they would have in the old way of marketing wool. When you consider that you can buy wool in South America for 7c and 8c and bring it in here and market over our tariff for around 30c — and, of course, that wool is about 10% better than ours because it is skirted and is more desirable for the mill manufacturer than our wool — we feel that we have gotten a pretty good price for the wool we have handled. But, we have to sell in order to keep this foreign wool from coming in. We have to sell our best wool' at about 29&gt;/4c. When you take that into consideration and the fact that wool is selling in Canada for 8c to 9c per pound, our wool is bringing a very good price. This is just one of the features of the farm flock. The little wool we get in the spring helps pay the expenses of the farm flock. We are getting about three times as much for our wool as they get in South America, New Zealand, and Australia. We can't hope to get the markets we got a few years ago when we could export quite a good deal of our wool. We have exported a Httle wool, but we have imported lots more. In 1929 we imported 292 million pounds of wool and produced 278 million pounds. Up to that time we had imported 3 million pounds and were producing about 3 million pounds. There has been very little wool exported during this time. A great many wool dealers consigned their surplus wool to Boston and held it over until 1930. On account of the depression and urgent need for money, this wool was all thrown on. the market. It didn't give us a chance to get rid of our 1930 clip when we expected to. If it hadn't been for the wool cooperators, this year you would have had to sell your wool at about 9c to 10c. If any of you want to go into. this wool business any further, you can get these bulletins. There is a lot about the national organiza - tion and its cooperative works, and I am sure you farmers are inter - ested in the cooperative farming and cooperative moving of our sturfs. At your leisure you can post yourself on it and I believe you will find It worth your while. I don't know that I have anything more to say. We have a ques - tion box here.

            <seg id="p615">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION MR. WEBER: As the number of farm flocks increases in Ne - braska, one of the problems that immediately arises is that of disease — disease prevention; parasites, internal and external. We have a man who understands that problem thoroughly. I am very glad to call on Dr. C. H. Hays who will talk on "Vim, Vigor, and Vitality." Dr. Hays. f VIM, VIGOR AND VITALITY IN SHKK1' DR. C. H. HAYS Mr. Chairman, Friends: Presenting a talk in a limited time on such a large subject makes it necessary to just cover the ground quickly. In order to do this, I have prepared a manuscript and will read it. In preparing this paper I anticipated something and put my finger in the pie in altering the program. I thought Mr. Ross would say some things that he didn't say. Now, in my talk I referred to some of these things, so I will probably have to explain them as 1 go along. . I was with Mr. Ross one time when he discussed the ques - tion of sheep. He brought in some things he did not refer to today that I think are vitally important from the disease angle. Vim, vigor and vitality are words which ooze a snap and certain kind of sparkle that may be boon, as a title for this discussion, to an expectancy which may not be satisfied with the subject matter to he herewith. presented. Howbeit, you should know, so that the speak - er's position may be more correctly and exactly appreciated, that this title was not self-selected; it was assigned. The title may therefore be thus exalted and be within good form, the title not having been a personal creation. Both the title and I appear as a part of your program because your committee on arrangements has willed it so. The privilege of presenting this discussion, however, I would assure you, ie greatly appreciated, but it is with a keen sense of responsibility that attempt is made to present information and advice which may be worthwhile and of help to you. It is hoped the values that may be incorporated will extend beyond a mere momentary interest, for with the developments that have occurred in the sheep Industry in Ne - braska, a profitable continuation and expansion must depend upon overcoming certain hazards that beset the industry and are now more or less disregarded or which are not understood or are misunderstood. That our minds may be somewhat in accord as to the limitations that bound this discussion, may I remind you; first, that the topic will be entirely limited to sheep under Nebraska conditions; second, that this matter will be kept within the alloted thirty minutes, and third, that these remarks will be largely as relate to sheep hygiene. Why the latter? Because your committee has seen fit to so limit and which may be readily appreciated if but a limited analysis of the title is </seg>
            <seg id="p616">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE made. Vim, vigor and vitality are three words which may be properly classified to mean the opposite of weakness, and therefore denote strength, a synonym for which may be health. We are, therefore, to discuss matters relating to the methods to preserve health among sheep. Perhaps,' one should go even farther and attempt to present a system of principles or rules designed to promote health. Principles so alike in purpose and similar are those which have so urgently been brought to the attention of the swine producer under the caption of McLain County System of Hog-lot Sanitation. At present we are not in a position to place before you so specific a plan of sheep hygiene as the one outlined a number of years ago for swine and which lias become so universally recognized as of great value to swine production. However, certain hygienic practices can be suggested,, the adoption of which will amply repay for the cost in time and monies of applying. Your committee was prevailed upon to alter the order of the program as published on the programs before you. Mr. Ross was placed to follow this discussion, but upon my suggestion precedes this discussion. There was no attempt in this to take advantage of Mr. Ross of position more favorable on your program, nor was there otherwise any selfish motive back of this suggested change. The change was based upon a presumed knowledge of what Air. Ross would recommend in part at least to you. Several weeks ago with a number of others, including Mr. Ross, I attended and took part in the program at a number of out-state feeder meetings held at various points in the state. At these meetings Mr. Ross discussed matters relating to sheep under a very similar title to that announced on the program for this meeting. He there spread before his audience, as he has here today, some of his observations and practices of sheep hygiene which have proven so valuable in his operations as a sheep husbandman. You have heard him describe his applied methods for handling sheep from western shipping points (and this might well have been any other points) through the exposures with the many pitfalls and enticements of traffic to the feedlot. He has gone farther with this handling of the sheep through the fattening operations (which ., likewise migh be breeding operations) Indicating the value of preserving health among the sheep. Mr. Ross indicated very keen observations for he has made his determinations and based his prac - tices upon facts which are supported by measured scientific investi - gations. As a system of sheep hygiene to promote health among livestock and to prevent the devitalizing waste that so viciously attacks the industry, the principles that have been laid down in this discussion by Mr. Ross cannot be too urgently recommended for your considera - tion. He has been most precise in the application of the practices for his measure at times Is .brought within the limits of minutes. The sheep industry in Nebraska today is in a more or less formative stage. </seg>
            <seg id="p617">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION particularly, as to breeding operations. It is true that the feeding and fattening for market have extended over quite a long period. In the past losses from death among sheep in these operations have been absorbed as a matter of course until many today seem to believe that a certain loss must obtain. The sheep involved In these past trans - actions as a rule have not been native bred nor even on Nebraska soil for any considerable period of time, and whatever may have de - veloped has been classified in most instances as a "bad break." At - tempts have been made in various ways to recover losses through salvage of dead sheep. The carcasses of sheep to be salvaged have gone into the hog lot, in many instances such a lot being maintained for the purpose, while in others the hog-lot was merely incidental. In any event such practices have absorbed losses which may be reasonably placed at an average of approximately five per cent of the sheep which have been brought into the state. There have been burled through these practices of handling the carcasses of dead sheep the causes to account for the losses. Whatever may be said in favor of feeding sheep carcasses to swine as a practical measure, it should be recognized that the practice is a very expensive one In the part it may play in covering up the cause of the losses among sheep that are thereby suffered. ■ To address ourselves more specifically to the question of disease as relates to sheep we would first remind you that among this class of livestock it will be observed that the ravages of contagion and Infection do not apply in the same measures as in other species of domestic animals. There are no specific infections to which sheep are highly susceptible as compare with the virus of hog cholera among swine, tuberculosis among cattle and swine, nor glanders among horse stock. It should not be inferred from this statement that sheep are not beset by infections for that would not be correct. However, specific infecions do not occur as a primary cause for devastlng our sheep population as occurs in the other species of domestic animals men - tioned. Infections more often occur where present as secondary factors following physiological disorders as result of dietary or parasitic in - festation. It may be correctly stated that among domestic animals appear - ing on pur farms, there is no species that suffers greater loss by death as result of parasites than do sheep. Both internal and external parasitic invasions are reasons for very great losses at times in sheep, many of which are readily to be prevented or controlled. Much of this waste from parasitic invasions among sheep is appreciated but on the other hand much is not appreciated. This may be said to be true of other species of livestock concerning some parasitic Infestations. Inasmuch as parasites may play so important a part among sheep. It may be as well to consider these first. </seg>
            <seg id="p618">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE \ji the internal parasites effecting the sheep the stomach worm (Hoemonchus contortus) is the more common and possibly does the greatest damage as seen under Nebraska conditions today. In view of the fact that sheep have not been maintained permanently on farms in the state, land and other premise contamination has not become so permanently fixed as prevails in the older sheep growing states. In order to prevent this parasite from becoming the serious economic pest which it has proven to be elsewhere, certain hygienic practices are to be recommended to prevent this, or at least to reduce the possibility of such contamination. A treatment has been perfected that can be used in a most practical way to rid sheep of the parasite. Time alloted for this discussion will not permit of our. engaging in a detailed discussion of the treatments. Suffice to say that treatment by a certain solution of copper sulphate in given amounts individually administered to the affected animals wil prove an almost , specific remedy. It is not recommended that treatments for stomach worm infestation be administered in a wholesale way through handling medication as a part of feeds. Many sheep coming into Nebraska feedlots suffer from stomach worm infestation that could be remedied to a sufficient' degree to be profitable. Lots of sheep that have been picked up from the market as culls, we venture the opinion are culls because they have been forced to carry a stomach worm infestation, a greater Infestation than they can comfortably support. These lots might be profitably treated. As a uniform suggestion to persons who may be stocking their farms with sheep, it may be recommended that all sheep brought onto the farm be put through a course of treatment to destroy such parasites, particularly stomach worms they may be carrying. This will prevent in a marked degree premise contamination. Another parasite which Invades the Intestinal tract which may be listed in this connection is the tape worm. This parasite has not been conspicuous among sheep coming under our observation in Ne - braska. There is more than one species of this parasite to which the sheep act as host. These may be considered as a single group. Tape worm infestation can be overcome by drugs with a marked degree of success. These are usually recommended in combination with the treatment to be administered for stomach worm, but in any event treatment for the tape worm Is not to be recommended unless the parasite are proven to be invaders. It is not so common an invader as the stomach worm. Sheep also act as a host in the life cycle of other species of tape worms than those which infest sheep as mature parasites, the cystic stage. These bladder-lfke cysts have been ob - served probably by many of you in the course of handling sheep carcasses. The cyst is of certain tape worms that infest the intestinal tract of dogs. These are of little economic importance, except as may be experienced through condemnation of infectted carcasses under meat </seg>
            <seg id="p619">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION inspection rulings. The preventive treatment to overcome this is as would be indicated, keep the dog free of tape worms. The liver fluke is a parasite that should be given attention because in some states it has proven very costly to the sheep industry. We have in mind particularly California where this parasite has been the cause of a very great waste. In Nebraska we have, as yet, not encoun - tered the infestation. As a matter of fact, we have not long con - fronted the stomach worm infestation. It may be that in time through sheep infested with the liver fluke, carrying this parasite in the state, the parasite may become established among the intermediate hosts available in our Nebraska soil and thereby perpetuate the parasite for infestation of other sheep. The snail of certain species is the intermediate host, and I am informed that we have in Nebraska snail in our soil that might prove a connecting link. Possibly some of these might, act as host for the liver fluke. We should give heed to study the cause of losses by death from sickness, and to place ourselves in position to cope with these problems with which we may become involved. We may add another parasite in passing to Intes - tinal group, the nodular worm. This parasite is quite common among sheep from the older sheep raising states but has not been classed as being of very serious economic importance. The heavy infestations that so often occur do not have a measurable effect apparently on the affected animal. The lung worm Invading sheep has probably given the greater alarm, particularly in the smaller group handling of sheep, than any of the other Internal parasites. This parasite can easily be demon - strated from lung tissue of infested sheep. .Little, as yet, is known of the life history of the parasite, but like many of the others, there is no doubt an intermediate host which acts to perpetuate the species. There has not been demonstrated to date any satisfactory treatment for this parasite. Treatments that will destroy the parasite will not permit the host to live. This parasite is an economic menace, causing rather serious disturbance where a heavy Infestation occurs. It should be kept In mind when we are recommending treatments for parasites that we appreciate that no treatment can be recommended as a com - plete relief. ' It is only, partial, as no medicinal agent has proven to be one hundred per cent efficient. We must seek a system of sanitation that will make the permanent habitation to be occupied by our sheep safe, thereby afford relief from the damages to be had from parasitic infestation. It has been very ably put that "Permanent Pastures Per - petuate Parasites." . • Advice regarding physiological disorders may logically have our attention next. Perhaps, this term is not proper to express. the point to be made. We have in mind the distressing disturbances to be attributed the result of exposures and Influences of public traffic and </seg>
            <seg id="p620">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Of AGRICULTURE to dietary irregularities which appear to play so important a part as cause for serious losses observed among sheep. In Colorado an ex- - tended series of observations and studies were made by the Colorado Experiment Station that give proof of the fact that such influences V K as these mentioned do play a very important part in relation to disease •' noted among sheep under feedlot operations. It was shown by such observations that the disease Hemorrhagic Septicemia caused from specific infection was not so often encountered as they had previously been led to believe occurs. It was found that other infections and infestations apparently become disease producing factors as result of exposures to which sheep may be subjected. Para-typhoid infection, of which you have heard so much in relation to swine, was round at times to be the cause of a fatal dissentary among sheep. Likewise, coccidia has under similar influence been cause of dissentary which has resulted in serious losses. There have come under our observation at least two outbreaks of coccidiosis among sheep in Nebraska, both of which were experienced in iambs on feed. We mention these factors as potentialities that must be reckoned with, and it should be made a privilege to have the opportunity to give a more careful study of these in their relation to losses occurring among sheep in Nebraska. . Disorders from a dietary cause are probably basic for greater losses among sheep trafficked into the state than result from any other causes. The studies in Colorado confirm such an observation, and Mr. Ross has indicated to you the serious loss that may occur from over-feeding on concentrates such as corn. This same holds true, though in a different form, among breeding ewes heavy with lamb in which an intoxication results and death may quickly follow either preceding or immediately following lambing. These conditions can be remedied by proper hygienic measures in relation to animal husbandry practices incident to feeding, Such disorders give rise to changes in the various organs of the body of the affected animal which have proven very misleading. Lung involvment as well as intestinal changes have been noted. Treatments of affected animals are necessarily symptomatic and usually not very satisfactory; pre - vention is the more practical and valuable recommendation. Other affections and maladies affecting sheep might be listed which would be of interest. We have reviewed the more common conditions that will be confronted in dealing with disease problems among sheep in Nebraska. These have been handled in more or less the order of their importance as relates to sheep on Nebraska farms. In conclusion, there are two other conditions that must be given special mention because of the frequency of their occurrence and the excite - ment caused from their presence. First is sore-mouth, lip-and-leg ulceration or necro baclllosis, synonyms that name a disease process commonly seen among sheep that are brought into the state to feed. The condition is recognized by the heavy scab formation appearing </seg>
            <seg id="p621">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION about the lips and over the face. Leg involvment is rarely seen. The condition is now generally accepted as caused by an infection, the Necrophorus bacillus. This organism is very widely distributed and is the cause for many other infectious conditions among domestic animals than .this. Bull-nose in pigs, foul-Foot in cattle, sore-mouth in pigs, foot-rot in sheep are all caused from the invasion of this bacterial organism. Abrasions as a result of feed provide for the entrance of the infective organism. The devitalizing influence of ship - ping may play a part as cause for the development of this condition in feeding lambs! The infection has rarely been of very serious economic consequence. Some observers have reported cases where the infection spread to internal membranes of the upper digestive tract causing death. The malady as it commonly occurs yields rather readily to treatment, consisting of a cleansing of the affected parts with a mild antiseptic. Such cleansing results in the exposure to the air of the invading organism which is not favorable for the growth of the infection, and, thereby, the disease process is overcome. It is more often to be noted that these disease processes run a limited course, and even in the absence of treatments eventually clear up. The inhibitions among the affected animals to feeding result in the more serious waste as result of this condition and may warrant recom - mended treatment to hasten recoveries. The second reference made in conclusion -is to scabies, scab, itch or mange also synonymous of the same condition. Most persons are more or less familiar with this condition which at one time was the most serious disease with which the sheep industry was con - fronted. The western range has gradually been cleaned of this disease until today the disease is relatively uncommon. However, there re - mains sufficient infection to cause considerable trouble among sheep with which we have to deal in Nebraska.- The condition is caused by a small spiderlike parasite or mite which invades the skin of sheep exposed to the infestation. There are scab formations eventually as the disease process advances, but in the early stages only a limited irritation will be noted. This disease causes a disturbance to sheep affected preventing or interfering with proper feeding. Under favorable conditions the disease spreads very rapidly both on the body of the affected animal and throughout the band or flock. Some difficulty may be experienced in recognizing this disease. Ticks and lice cause irritation but should be readily distinguished from scabies. There is available in Nebraska through the State Department of Agriculture a service to assist in diagnosis and handling of scabies in sheep. Under the present administration prompt attention has been given to each case of reported scabies or where the disease has been suspected. We have had in mind prevention of the extension of this disease and its becoming more greatly established in the state. Treat - ment consists of dipping in a solution of proper insecticide that will </seg>
            <seg id="p622">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Kin ihe scab mites. This should be done under official supervision of the state or the cooperating United States Bureau of Animal Indus - try. Many of the larger organizations feeding lambs handle their own scabies with great success. The smaller operators are not equipped and give less prompt attention to the disease which accounts for the greater part of the waste of today from such source. Every possible provision to prevent scabies from becoming established in our farm flocks should be taken. In closing it is recommended that a. closer attention be given to diseases among sheep, with a view to establishing more specitlc causes. It is a new industry in some respects in our state, find we are most fortunate if we will but take the opportunity to prevent the invasion of our virgin soils with the infestations that have proven so costly and have become such great hazards for a profitable industry in other places. MR. WEBER: Those of you who have questions, feel free to write as many as you have on these cards. Dr. Hays and others will be here to participate in the question box period. Drop the questions in the box now or after luncheon. I have been asked to call your attention to the fact that Family Fun Feed tickets are on sale outside the door, as are tickets for the master Farmer banquet tonight. We will now go to the meat laboratory for the lamb slaughtering demon - stration. This will probably last until 12:15. I am sure it will be interesting to all of you. The crowd moved to the Meat Laboratory where Professor LoefTel conducted a lamb slaughtering demonstration. This proved very in - teresting and was well attended. This demonstration closed the sheep meetings for the morning. Tuesday Afternoon Session Mr. Hildebrand, president of the Improved Livestock Breeders Association, presided at this meeting. MR. HILDEBRAND: I want to call your attention to the ques - tion box. Put any questions you have in It. If you have any sug - gestions to offer as to how these meetings can be improved and better lined up to satisfy your needs, make these suggestions on the cards. If you know of any talent you would especially like to hear on these programs, put that on your card. Your suggestions will all be given consideration in making up next year's program. We want to give you programs that will give you the most profit possible. </seg>

            <seg id="p624">.NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION We must hurry along with the meeting. The first speaker un the program this afternoon needs no introduction here. He has the graphs to show what the future is going to do and what has been done in the past. Harold Hedges will talk on "Significant Sheep Statistics." Mr. Hedge. SIGNIFICANT SHEEP STATISTICS HAROLD HEDGES Since the time is short, I will probably have to follow my paper rather closely. I note in looking over this morning's program that Mr. Koss discussed tte A-B-C's of the sheep business. Judging from the topic assigned tome, "Significant Sheep Statistics," I am down to talk about the "S's" of that business. By the way, did you ever hear what the three "S's" in business stand for? They stand for "Start. Serve and Stick." In view of what has happened in the sheep business in the year just past, it may take considerable courage and nerve to "stick" with it. Evidently some of you are doing it, however, because the audience today is not made up entirely of people new to a sheep pro - gram here at the college. The statistics we have on sheep are a partial history of the sheep business — a history expressed in terms that permit a measure of the changes that are taking place. Like other histories, these statistics tell not only what has happened in the past, but may give a fair indication of what may happen under similar conditions in the future. Speaking of statistics, perhaps you have heard of the man who made a detailed study of all the census data relating to marriage. His startling discovery was that approximately half of the married people of the United States were women. ' Perhaps I can safely conclude from the direction prices have taken in the year just past that some of you may have lost a dollar or two in feeding sheep. What factor or combination of factors has contributed to the present low level of sheep prices? Has there been sufficient adjust - ment in the situation so that we can expect substantial improvement In the near t future? From a low point in 1922 sheep numbers have increased until on January I, 1930, or a year ago, they were about a third larger than In 1922. In 1922 there were about thlrty-slx million head of sheep and lambs on farms In the United States, in 1930 nearly forty-nine million head. On the basis of yearly average </seg>

            <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ prices. Iamb prices moved up from a low point in 1921 to a high in 1925 and remained at a level only slightly below 1925, until in the winter of 1929-30. You may wonder why prices held up so well following 1925 despite the increased number of sheep and lambs in the country. For one thing, during the period from 1922 up to and including 1929 there was a rather definite increase in per capita consumption of mutton and lamb, representing an improved demand. One thing contributing to that was sustained activity in industry and business during that period, particularly in the northeastern part of the United States where most of the lamb and mutton are consumed. When the business de - pression got under way, its effect on lamb demand and prices appeared unusually severe because it came at a time when sheep and lamb numbers had been built up to a relatively high point. During the period when sheep numbers were increasing, there was not a proportionate increase in slaughter of sheep and lambs. Based on inspected slaughter, the increase of. 1929 over 1922 was about 29 per cent compared with an increase of thirty-five per cent in numbers. The reason was this: Instead of the normal number of ewe lambs required for replacement being held back, a larger pro - portion were kept back to increase flock. In 1930, the situation changed because of the price break. Instead of holding back ewe lambs, the tendency was to liquidate.. Based on slaughter figures for the first eleven .months of 1930, slaughter of sheep and lambs in the year just past was about 15 per cent greater than in 1929, or 50 per cent greater than 1922. Not only has the tendency to increase flocks stopped, but the sharp increase in slaughter points to some decrease in sheep and lamb numbers. However, the decrease, if any, is nof nearly so great as the increase in slaughter might indicate. The proportion of aged sheep in the slaughter in 1930 was much smaller than in 1929. In 1929, about 9 per cent of the sheep and lambs slaughtered were aged sheep, that is, older than yearlings. In the first nine months. of 1930, aged sheep made only about 6 per cent of those slaughtered. This represents an actual decrease of close to 20 per cent in number of aged sheep slaughtered. The principal reason for this has probably been the fact that aged sheep have returned so little over actual marketing expense, that growers have felt they are worth more to produce another lamb than to sell on the market. Over the next few years there will probably be some reduction in sheep numbers. While that occurs, market receipts are increased by the amount of the liquidation. If the adjustment occurs gradually' the consequences will be less severe than if made quickly. Previous liquidations following undue expansion have been rather too drastic. Take 1920-1921 for example. They not only brought unnecessary losses but carried the reduction in breeding flocks too far. </seg>
            <seg id="p627">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION Tims far I have said nothing about wool. Wool, ot course, is a world commodity and world trends in production must be considered. World production haB shown little change in the past three years after showing substantial increases during ftie preceding six or eight years. World sheep numbers and therefore world production of wool now seem fairly well stabilized except as there may be year to year variations due to such factors as . drouth in Australia. Wool prices started their downward trend in 1928 and, of course, have been held down by continued large world production since as well as by the world depression and lower general commodity price levels. Most of my discussion thus far has concerned the long-time out - look, in which the sheep producer Is especially interested. Since he can not get in or out of the business except at considerable cost, it is to his advantage to concern himself with more than the market of the next few weeks or months. The sheep or lamb feeder has a different proposition. There is rather a quick turnover in his business. He has little concern beyond the end of his feeding period. His interest is In such things as the size of the lamb crop, the time and volume of the market movement and what other feeding areas are doing. The 1930 lamb crop of the United States was estimated to be about 8 per cent larger than the 1929 crop, not only because more ewes lambed out but because more lambs were saved per one hundred ewes. More of the Increase was in western range states than in the native lamb states. Thus the potential supply for feeding and for market was well above recent years. How many of these are on feed for the winter and spring markets and where are they on feed? An unusual distribution of the lambs on feed this winter makes it more difficult than usual to size up the lamb feeding situation. The number of feeder lambs shipped from twelve markets into seven Cornbelt states from July to November inclusive were 9 per cent less than a year ago. November shipments, however, were only slightly under last year while early December shipments were larger than a year ago. Direct shipments into the Cornbelt were probably larger than last year. Also, there were more native lambs on feed. Con - sequently,, the total in Cornbelt states is probably as large as last year. - The December first lamb feeding report indicated a large increase in feeding in North Dakota and in such western slope £.reas and the San Luis valley, but supplies from such sources are only a small part - of the total. Of much more significance is the movement into Colorado and western Nebraska feed lots. The December first report indicated a material decrease in total numbers on feed there, despite a rather large November movement. Figures on the December movement into Colorado and western Nebraska should be available within a short time and will give a better idea of western feeding situation. </seg>
            <seg id="p628">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Considering the location of lots of lambs on feed in the Cornbelt, the marketing of fed lambs in the next month or six weeks should continue liberal and at least as large as a year ago. Unless there has been an unusually heavy movement of feeding lambs since De - cember first into western feed lots which are usually emptied from February to April, the supply of fed lambs at that season should be smaller than in 1930. As I said previously, we have no good idea regarding the number of lambs on feed in .states outside of the regular areas nor when they will move to market. Hence, the ditttculty in sizing up the situation. MR. HILDEBRAND: Professor Hedges said he would give us the three "S's" of sheep feeding. I think there is another. "S" that could be added— short. I think that is the most important "S" this year. If there is anyone here who wants to buy Master Farmer banquet tickets, the boys have them and will go through the crowd now. Any - one desiring them please raise your hands. After our next talk Professor Weber will have charge of the question box. We have all learned that this is one of the important features on our programs and I am sure we gain a lot from the discussions which are given. I was very much interested at the meeting of the National Live Stock and Meat Board in December. This board is made up of all classes of livestock men — hog men, sheep men, cattle men, meat retail - ers, packers — and it was interesting to hear these men discuss the various problems. Apparently the sheep men have been spending some time advertising their product. Some cattle men feel that people have been losing their appetite for beef. At any rate, 1 know we all appreciate these talks by Professor Hedges. He gives us an insight into the future and we can base our operations accordingly. Our next speaker is from another state — Illinois. We know we have it over Illinois In one respect at least. This year Nebraska produced more corn than Illinois did. We are very glad to have with us this afternoon Professor Kammlade of ITrbana, Illinois. He will talk on "New Lamb-Feeding Facts." </seg>
            <seg id="p629">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION NEW IjAMB-FEEDINU FACTS W. G. Kamnilade Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: Nebraska may be ahead of us in the production of corn, but we went along with Nebraska and went Democrat this fall. A fellow back there said to another: "What would you be if you weren't a Democrat?" He said "I'd be ashamed." All these statistics remind me of a school superintendent who visited a country school. He felt that the teacher hadn't taught her students to be observant so he set about to prove it. He said to one, "Give me a number." The pupil replied by giving the number 23. The superintendent wrote 32 on the blackboard and called for another number. This time. he got 45 and wrote 54; the third number, 36, he changed to 63. Sitting on the front row was a little freckled chap. He waved his hand vigorously and said, "Say, mister, I'll give you a number." The superintendent smiled and waited for the boy to speak again. The lad looked up and said "Write 77 and just try to change that, you big sucker." There are some figures that are rather hard to change. I went to a sheep man in Illinois the other day and said "How is the lamb business?" "Well," he said, "it's looking up." I said "What do you mean?" The man replied, "Well, it's flat on its back.' By the way, Mr. Ross was on the program at Oklahoma with me last summer when it was 113 degrees in the shade and everywhere else. He talked about wool down there. Some fellow who had the job of fixing up these programs played a dirty trick on me. They wired and asked me if I would come down. I thought I was to come and listen in, so I said I would be on hand. Then when a' letter came they had assigned me the subject of "New Lamb-Feeding Facts." I don't know enough new lamb-feeding facts to talk very long. What I really have in mind is some old facts, re-emphasized. I have had some enlightening experiences this fall in connection with our lamb feeding work, besides finding out some things I thought the people knew but they didn't know. The thing I have in mind is the importance of margin in feeding lambs. A good many of our feeders figured that there was going to be a lot of money in feeding lambs this season because they could buy their feeder lambs at tic or GM;c and fat lambs were selling around 7% to 8c. They figured they had a 2c margin and that was sufficient to give them a good profit. I got into some difficulty saying some things and getting them in the paper. I made the statement that there was no more profit to be gained in buying feeder lambs at 6c and selling at 8c than there was </seg>
            <seg id="p630">REPORT Oh' NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE • 11 uujing at 12c and selling at 12c. In one case you had a 2c margin and in the other no margin. I had letters from nearly every stati' in the Union except Nebraska. One fellow in Michigan wrote me a very caustic letter saying I was all wrong — there was a lot more profit in buying at 6c and selling at 6c. If you assume that your cost of feeding is the same, there is no more profit in one than in the other. As a matter of fact, if your cost is the same this year as last, there is very little profit; in fact, there is a loss in buying at 6c and selling at 8c. That may keep the lamb business on its back, but it will still be looking up. I assumed that it took a 9c feed cost to put a pound of gain on the lambs. You put on 30 pounds of gain. That makes a feed cost of $2.70. Now, add to this the price of a 60-pound lamb at 6c and you have $6.30, the total cost of the lamb. If you sell a 9!&gt;-pound lamb at 8c you get $7.20. You have a profit of 9.0c. Take the other case. Buy at 12c and the lamb costs you $7.20, assuming that it is a 60-pound lamb. Put on $2.70 feed cost and after adding this to the purchase price you have a total of $9.90. If you sell at 12c it brings you $10.80. Subtracting, you have 90c profit — the same in both cases. The largest lamb feeder in the state of Wisconsin objected so strongly that I was wrong in that statement that we went down to the University and argued with several professor and economists. They finally convinced him that I was right and he was wrong. All I can do about it is to say this. This is not a new lamb - feeding fact, but it is a thing which is very important. The buying and selling phase of the lamb feeding business which is farthest re - moved from the lamb feeders' control and is one of the most significant things in determining its profit. I don't know what can be done about it, but that remains the same. In spite of the margin between buying and selling price, you may not make a profit on feeding lambs and a -good many folks, when they figure up their year's efforts will not have a big profit. The cheaper you buy the lambs, the less you will lose. If you buy high you have a chance to lose more than if you buy them low. You have more of a fighting chance this year. I wanted to bring this to your attention. A good many of our feeders didn't know this and they didn't take time to make a few calculations. They say dry farming is farming on paper, but it's rather profitable at times. If you can buy your lambs at 6c and sell at 10c — now, if you can control that selling price, you are all right. That is a lamb - feeding fact not new, but old, but apparently not widely known or appreciated. This Is not the only factor which influences the necessary margin, but most of the others seem to be better understood. If some way could be found to control the margin between the . two prices — paid and received — most of the troubles of the lamb feeders </seg>
            <seg id="p631">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION would be over, for there is nothing in the general experiences 01 me feeders which goes farther toward determining their income than this margin, and yet it is more completely beyond their control than any other factor. There are many of these things which cover margin that might be discussed. I will not take time to say more about them now. Rations and methods of feeding are the main topics discussed at such gatherings as this and I want to say a few things about them \ as they relate to costs, rate of gain, and troubles in the feed lots. Throughout the lamb feeding section of the United States there is no ration more extensively and satisfactorily used than corn or barley and legume hay. Furthermore, such ration may well be taken as a standard and with it may be compared various modifications of it. as well as the various departures from it. Let us remember that good lambs are produced with good feeds carefully fed. It is as impossible to make good lambs by using poor feeds or poor methods of feeding as it is to make a good building from poor materials or poor work - manship. Corn or barley' and alfalfa hay are good feeds, balance well in nutrients, and may be expected to produce a pound gain every three days, or a daily gain of one-third pound. This is more gain than most feeders secure and I am thinking of an approximate maximum. If it is the feeder's intention to secure this rate of gain, then he will need to feed approximately equal amounts of grain and hay when the lambs are on full feed. If it is his purpose to use large amounts of roughage, then the rate of gain will be lessened, as well as the grain consumption. To Increase the grain so that the lambs are fed more grain than roughage is for the average feeder a dangerous procedure because of the possibility of large death losses. I want to digress for a moment to say a word about death losses. Aside from a few outbreaks of infectious and contagious diseases, death losses among feeding lambs are mainly due to digestive troubles. I am not a veterinarian, but observations suggest that these digestive troubles result mainly from two causes — poor rations and improper methods of feeding. Undue haste in getting the lambs on full feed has been an enlightening and often saddening experience to many feeders. This is true, too, of the attempt to keep grain b'efore the lambs at all times. So far as I know there have been few feeders who have accomplished the latter without large death losses or serious digestive troubles. At the Illinois Experiment Station we have been trying to develop what we sometimes refer to as a "fool-proof method" of .feeding lambs. Tiriefly, this has consisted of grinding. both the grain and roughage, mixing them together, and self-feeding the lambs. At the start of the feeding, the lambs are given a mixture of about three pounds of </seg>
            <seg id="p632">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE luugiidge to one pound of grain. This is changed gradually until the lambs are getting a mixture of equal parts of grain and roughage. Results with the lambs have been good. No serious digestive troubles have developed; gains have' been faster than in similar lots of lambs hand-fed on unmixed feeds, and in the same length of feeding period the finish has been better. The cost of grinding and mixing has added to the cost of the gains, but there is very little difference be - tween the feed required per 100 pounds gain up to the time a given weight is secured. The higher condition of the self-fed lamb is, however, usually attained in the same feeding period at a greater feed requirement than in the case of the hand-fed lambs. I want to say that I have appreciated the talks that I have heard here since coming this morning and I thank you very much for. your attention. If you have questions, I shall be very glad to answer them. Following this talk a number of questions were asked. Professor Kammlade answered these and the discussion was very much worth while. MR. HILDEBRAND: I know we have all enjoyed very much this wonderful talk by this gentleman from Illinois. He has given us a lot to think about. The old formula— buy them cheap and sell them high — and also the self-feeding method for greater gains is new to you people. I know it has been very interesting to me and I am sure we are all indebted to him for coming to us and giving us this truth. The next gentleman on the program Is a man from the college. He will answer the many questions that you have placed in the box. Mr. Weber. : MR. WEBER: Our time is limited. I will ask Mr. Ross to answer a couple of questions from his field. From them we will go on to some of the others. Mr. Ross. MR. ROSS: The first question reads, "Do lambs need warm water in the winter time?" We all know that it is much easier for us to drink a glass of warm water in the winter time than it is for us to drink a glass of ice water. I think if you can get the water to the temperature it comes out of the ground, that is plenty warm enough for lambs. With ice water and ice in the trough a lamb will not drink the water that is necessary. Consequently, I think it pays extremely well to have the water as warm as it comes out of the ground. If a lamb puts on much weight, he has to have a lot of water to help. Q. What is the relative death loss in corn field and .dry lot feeding of western lambs? A. This morning I thought my talk was just on farm flocks and ewe flocks. I have been talking. on grass feeding some, and so Dr. </seg>
            <seg id="p633">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION Hays based his talk on what he expected I was to say. On the rtmnvti death loss between the corn field and the feed lot, we have never been able at home to turn our lambs in the corn field and let them go. We have been holding them just about so long. We had a bunch of lambs that had been in the corn field up until last Saturday. They began to die. There were eight lambs out of this bunch of 1,40(1 lambs that died. We took them out of the corn and put them on barley In the troughs. Tt seems those lambs were getting something out there that didn't agree with them. When your lambs begin to die in the feed lot, the thing to do is to change feed. Following the discussion of these questions by Mr. Hoss, Dr. Hays- answered several pertaining to disease. Then, as the time was short, Mr. Weber turned the meeting over to Mr. Hildebrand. MR. HILDEBRAND: The time is growing near to hear the man I know you want to hear. There is, as you all know, a joint meeting in the Student Activities building at which Mr. Alexander Legge will speak. It is just about time for that meeting to begin. Don't forget, tomorrow all day we' will have a wonderful meeting here in this building.

Hog prices, which began. to decline after July, 1929, are due to hit bottom within the next 30 to 90 days. Low corn prices compared with hog prices as well as the drop in hog prices themselves have contributed to a holding back of hogs — a situation that will likely bear down on the early 1931 market. The bottom of an extended move - ment downward in hog prices tends to come a little later than the most usual season low which is December or January. Any general improvement in price levels such as would increase buying power is unlikely before the period April to June. On the other hand, the ■ 1930 spring pig crop was smaller than that of the year before and the 1930 fall pig crop also shows some decrease in size. The move - ment of hogs in early 1931 should, therefore, decline rather quickly and the load of fall pigs on the June-July market should be light. Some improvement in hog prices by March or April is a reasonable expectation, and with any marked improvement at that time there should be little doubt as to a good outlook for hogs well into 1932 at least. The Decline in Corn and Hog Prices The small corn crop preceded by a small corn crop as is the case in 1930 has on the average resulted in a corn price decline from August to December of about 19%. The decline this year is from a 99V£c top in August to a 72c top in December, or a decline of 28 per cent. Furthermore corn price continued to decline during De - cember and reached 61%c by December 20, thus being 10%c under the early December top of 72c. This puts the market for the small 1930 corn crop in a much different position that was the small l!)01 crop or the small 1913 crop. In each of these two small corn crop years there was so much concern about future supplies that price in November was %c to 5%c higher than at any time in the previous six months. Such a situation this year would mean that in November corn would have had to be $1.00 a bushel or higher, whereas the lop for November was 73c. </seg>
            <seg id="p635">NEBRASKA- IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION The level of livestock prices is high compared with that of grains, and feeds. This induces continued feeding just as if we had had a big corn crop. Furthermore a general trend downward in hog prices combined, with a small corn crop have on the average resulted in an autumn break in price of around 18 to 20 per cent. Combined with a large corn crop the fall break has averaged 26%. This year the decline from August to December had equalled 28%, or about what would be expected after a large corn crop. Favorable prices for feed - ing and an unusually sharp break in hog prices for a year like this has caused slower marketing of hogs than usual after a small corn crop. This may cause a bunching of supplies in the latter part of January and February. . , Bottoms When Hor Prices Have Been on a Ivong Time Decline .;' Following a prolonged decline in hog prices like that which began in July, 1929, the bottom of prices has most frequently been reached between February and June. There have been eleven such periods of prolonged declines in hog prices since .1880. In nine of the eleven instances the low point in price was reached in either Feb - ruary, May or June. In only three instances did the low fall in the period September to December, inclusive. In years when bottoms have been reached, the low point most frequently has fallen a little later than the usual seasonal low which comes in December or January. Improvements in the General Price Level The general level of commodity prices has been declining since .September, 1928. The decline has therefore covered a period of about 2 7 months. This has been equalled or exceeded since 1900 only once, namely, in the period January, 1903 to May, 1905, a declining period 28 months long. Since 1900 there has been eight periods of gen - erally declining prices extending over 14 to 28 months each. In six cases out of the eight the bottom has been reached in the period April to June, inclusive. Once the low point came as early as January and once in March. Seasonal weakness in so many prices from March to June inclusive Is perhaps the main reason for low points in the cycle being reached, most frequently in the spring of the year. With little likelihood of increased buying power before spring or early summer there is little in the demand situation to encourage advances in hog prices before April or later. First Half of 1981 Supplies After the marketing of hol'd-back winter fed hogs in January mid February supplies for the remainder of the first half of 1931 should fall off. rather sharply. There is a tendency every three or four years, however, to bunch supplies on the June and July markets. The two things in this year's situation likely to prevent bunching </seg>
            <seg id="p636">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE supplies on the June and July markets are the two small corn crops of 1929 and 1930 and the unprofitableness of holding hogs into the June and July period last year. Unless corn prices remain weaker than we think they will, small supplies of corn combined with memories of the weak June and July market last year and the price decline taken this fall on hogs held back for longer feeding, will all tend to encourage short feeding of the fall pig crop. The failure of heavy hog prices to maintain a premium because of the number of hogs held back this fall and early winter will also encourage giving the fall pig crop a short turn. It would seem, therefore, that any bunching of supplies after the first two months of the new year Is more likely to come In late April and May, the most unusual seasonal weak spots for the fall pig crop, rather than later in June and July. An April price decidedly above the March top will be a good sign that the turn up in hog prices is under way. Production Plans Hog slaughter was at its height in 1928 and prices reaches their low point in about March of that year. There seems little doubt but what this advance would have continued for some months past July, 1929, had it not been for the business set-back starting In the latter part of that year. With any improvement in business in 1931 and the check on increased supplies of hogs arising from two small corn crops in succession, there should be every encouragement for the hog producer well Into 1932 at least. This is my first chance to talk to a group of Nebraska farmers and I assure you I have enjoyed it very much. I hope you have. t&gt; . ; MR.

WOOD I am going to take only about ten minutes this morning to tell you where you can get plans. for various kinds of handy equipment. Last summer I was out south of Lexington in Dawson county. I heard about a man over there by the name of Mike Lowdry. I don't believe I have ever seen so many handy things on a farm as on his. He has spent a lot of time and money on the hog equipment. Practically everything he has is made of his own equipment. I didn't even see any wire gates on his farm. The one thing that appealed to me on Mr. Lowdry's farm was a piece of equipment made out of an old model T Ford. He took an old model T Ford and took off the body. He put over the front what we call a trailer hitch. He can put this thing either behind a truck or pull it with one or two horses. Mr. Lowdry took six oil barrels and cut the heads off. These set on the chassis. Between the oil barrels he has a wooden box for grain. This gives a capacity of six barrels of slop and enables one to haul grain between. I shall be glad to explain how this is made if any of you are particularly interested. Mr. Lowdry reports that this cost him about $15.00 to do all the work. It is' a very handy piece of equip - ment. One other thing that Mr. Lowdry has on his farm is extremely, good — his hog watering system. There is nothing quite so Incon - venient around a hog farm as some method for watering hogs. Then, another thing on feeding that I wanted to mention. 1 be - lieve one of the most popular feeders on the campus is this Nebraska pig cafeteria. There were about 1.100 of these built in the state of Nebraska last year and sold through the lumber yards. It is a 60 - bushel feeder. It is not a cheap feeder. I do not know where you can find the plans for a real cheap feeder that is really good. There is quite a tendency now to split 2x4's. This does not pay. This feeder is built with full 2x4's. It is a 60-bushel feeder. This feeder costs about 80c per bushel. If you were to hire it built it would cost about J48.00. This feeder will stay by you for years to come while a cheap feeder will net. It can be divided inside to feed tankage in one side and grain in the other. It has proved to be one of the best feeders that we have used here at the college. It can be bought through many lumber yards. for $50.00. We have probably received more questions on the one subject of how to get water out to hogs when you have your hogs moved out on clean ground. Of course, up along the Platte river where you can drive a well in live minutes the problem is easily solved. Those of us who live on hills, I do not know any more convenient method for hauling water out to the hog houses than one of these </seg>
            <seg id="p638">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tank wagons. You take an ordinary wagon with a box. You can move this to the well and hook on a hose. This wagon is very handy. You can haul it in to the house as you come from the field, then you can take it back when you go to the field. You draw the water out of this tank into a common, ordinary stock tank. I am not going to say much about houses. I just want to call your attention to one thing. I just checked up on the number of A-type hog houses sold in the state. Three hundred and forty lumber yards sold 12,000 houses. We didn't check on every lumber yard in the state. I believe there were probably 25,000 of these houses sold. The material in this house cost $12.50. You can buy it built for $14.50 or $16.00. I do not know that we have ever had anything any better. By the way, this house was invented and originally made by a farmer living near Harvard, Mr. Whisenand. I have some prints of that house here and I will leave them with your secretary. If you want one, you can call for it. We have some hog men in the state who have no other house than this type. They use them for farrowing. They line them up and use them for shade during the summer. They line them up in the winter in ■ a method described here and use them for straw houses. Your large size central hog house runs usually about $60.00. There Is no way you can provide a home any cheaper for a hog than by this method. I invite you to visit me over at the Engineering building. I will try to show you anything we have. We have blue prints of all kinds of equipment. Breeding crates, shipping crates, loading chutes— all are things we have. I thank you. MR. McDlLL: I wish to make an announcement about Fun Feed tickets. They are all sold unless someone has some extra ones. The next speaker on our program 1b Dr. S. W. Alford, superin - tendent of our serum plant. He will talk to us about a subject which is of vital interest to all hog men. Following his talk Mr. LoefTel will come up here and lead a discussion on some of the problems of this disease. Dr. Alford. HOG FLU . DR. S. W. ALFORD In regard to Fun Feed tickets, I might give you some informa - tion on that, being sort of the big chief in handling this feed. We have arranged to pass out tickets to the various secretaries with the instructions that any unsold ticket be turned back today. At five o'clock there will be established a ticket exchange. Any unsold tickets or any that people want to cash back will be assembled at the door of the Student Activities building then. There will be a chance of petting tickets then for this evening. </seg>
            <seg id="p639">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATION About twelve years ago this fall there appeared In this nuius, as well as in other states, a peculiar disease among hogs. 1 think tin; first time it was called to our attention in this state was out here at the State Fair the first week in September. There appeared a disease among hogs that seemed to spread very rapidly. Nobody knew what it was. The symptoms of the disease were very pro - nounced. At times it showed the earmarks of an acute respiratory infection of some sort. It was something new. Nobody knew what it was. This disease appeared over all the country at about the same time. Since that time it has made its appearance in the state at various points every fall. It seems to be a fall disease, something like hog cholera. Hog cholera is a fall disease. So is this new disease that we have termed flu. It nearly always appears in August, ■ September, and October. That is when it is the most prominent, although I have seen cases of flu in hogs at other times of the year. We have had this flu with us every year since 1918. It has caused considerable loss. The mortality is not so high, but it has caused loss in the way of shrinkage, etc. When this disease made its appearance twelve years ago considerable attention was given to it and everyone was trying to name it. There was a veterinarian by the name of Dr. Cohen, and as far as I know the name does not signify the nationality that one would naturally think of. He is now at Dlootuington. Illinois. He was in the Government service then and made quite a study of this new disease In hogs and finally came to the conclusion that this flu in hogs was very much like the flu we were having in people at that time, so he said "This is hog flu." He suggested this name for the disease at the veterinarians' meeting and at every .place he was laughed down by the people, but the name of the disease is still hog flu. I guess that is about as good a name as we can have for it. It is very similar to flu in the human family. Until we can find out more about the disease, cause, etc., it will prob - ably be continued to be called flu. Influenza in the hog does not mean anything so far as naming the disease is concerned. It is an epidemic and that is as far as it goes. It does not specify anything. It is not specific. It is not like tuberculosis, black leg, hog cholera — those terms are specific. There has been considerable study made of this disease since it made its appearance in this country with very little result as to determining the cause of the thing. There is one peculiarity about this disease. That is the organism that is observed as the cause of the disease is hard to handle outside of the hog. Some work has been done in trying to determine the cause of this disease, but the little organism that is suspected as being the cause of the disease won't live outside of the hog. Consequently, it doesn't lend itself to study like some of the other diseases where the organism can be </seg>
            <seg id="p640">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Kept alive and worked with. About the only time one lias an oppor - tunity to make a study of this disease is when one has the sick hogs. The period of study is relatively short and, as a result, there are very few data available that are of any value as to the cause of this disease. From, all appearances it is an acute respiratory infection. That is about all we know. The symptoms of the disease are as follows: The attack Is sudden. The pigs always have a high temperature. There is an extreme exhibition of the. characteristic thumpy breathing, which is perhaps the most characteristic diagnosis symptom. There is a watery discharge from the eye which is entirely different from the charac - teristic discharge from the eye in cholera. This discharge is a watery discharge. The same is true of the nasal discharge which is of a pussy nature as in hog cholera. Those are about all the symptoms we have of the disease. There are two or three diseases that one can easily become con - fused with in differentiating flu from, and those are hog cholera and pneumonia — that is, the common cases of pneumonia. Perhaps the most difficult one to differentiate it from is hog cholera. I think the most pronounced symptom by which it can be differentiated from hog cholera Is that thumpy breathing which you do not always have in hog cholera. I never did see a case of flu In hogs that did not have the characteristic thumpy breathing, but I have seen cases of hog cholera without it. I don't mean that you don't have this thumpy breathing in cholera, because you do sometimes. Occasionally we have pneumonia develop in hog cholera which produces the thumpy breathing hogs, while in flu all of the hogs have that thumpy breathing. Another thing which is characteristic of flu is the sudden attack of the disease. The disease will make its appearance today and tomorrow the hogs are all sick. That isn't true with cholera. Usually the first hog will take sick and then several days after another will be affected, maybe in another week another. With Influenza they practically all get sick within 48 hours. The flu that we are having now is not quite like it was when it made its first appearance. It doesn't attack quite so severely or suddenly and it doesn't spread quite so rapidly. Now, as far as treatment is concerned, we don't have a great deal to offer you. Inasmuch as we don't know the cause, we don't have much to offer in the way of treatment. There have been several different ways tried. My personal opinion is that they are all failures. Flu in hogs is usually treated about the time the hogs are ready to get well of their own accord. The mortality in this disease does not run high. I think the maximum proportion will run 5% mortality. That is not a very heavy loss and considering the sudden attack of </seg>
            <seg id="p641">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION the disease and the severity of it, the death loss is not very high, l never have seen it run over 5% in any herd. The treatment for flu, in my judgment, is very closely associated with the practice in the human. When a person gets a bad attack of the flu, they put him to bed. They keep him down until he is thoroughly recovered. I think that is about the best thing that can be done with a herd of hogs suffering from flu. Leave them alone. The less you disturb a herd of hogs suffering from this disease, the better will be the outcome. These hogs are very weak. Any exertion that these hogs are put to is going to make their recovery more slow. You take a herd of hogs suffering from this disease. Give them a good, well ventilated place to sleep. Leave them alone. Put water close by so they will not have to travel 100 yards. They will drink lots, so keep plenty of good water close. They won't eat much. If they do want to eat, have your feed close by. I do not know that it makes much difference about the feed. Thy won't eat much any - way. In my experience and my judgment that Is the proper way to treat flu in hogs. Death from flu usually happens from a complication of pneumonia. Practically all of the hogs that I have posted have died not from influenza but from pneumonia. When you look back to the outbreak of flu in the human family I think you will all agree that the majority of the people who died contracted pneumonia in connection with flu. The same is true of hogs. I think a good many hogs are killed because they have been driven and forced out in that weakened con - dition. They couldn't stand it. They would have been all right and probably would have recovered if they had been left alone. There is just one point that I want to mention in regard to pre - vention. To the hog raiser who is exhibiting bogs at the fairs and any place away from home, It is always good advice and a good practice on returning those hogs to your premises to not turn them in with your hogs that you have on your place until you are thoroughly convinced that these hogs are not going to come down with flu. That is how a lot of flu is spread and where a lot of fellows get this is at fairs. I think it is a good policy, when you bring these hogs home from the fair to isolate them. Keep them away from the others for two or three weeks. Then if they are gorng to get the flu there is not such a chance that they will spread it. The majority of flu In these severe outbreaks has been brought in by hobs exhibited at fairs. There is nothing In the way of preventive treatment that will keep them from getting flu. There is nothing in the way of handling that will keep them from getting it. In an outbreak of flu it apparently makes very little difference as to how they are handled whether they get It or not. Hogs handled In the most sanitary manner possible contract the disease. I do not believe there is anything in the way </seg>
            <seg id="p642">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 01 nandling hogs that will keep them from getting influenza. If they are exposed to it, they will get it anyway. Following this talk by Dr. Alford a number of questions were asked. They are not listed here,' but from the answers given it is easy to read what the questions were. The disease attacks hogs more severely under one year of age. It is a young hog disease and in a herd of hogs weighing 175 to 200 pounds — about ready for market — and flu gets in there, the shrinkage is terrible and in young pigs the shrinkage is great and partial recov - ery is numerous. A lot of pigs that have had this flu never entirely recover. Many times it causes an adherence of the lungs to the ribs. If hogs have to sleep out in a cold rain or bad weather, your death loss will run considerably more. It takes about a week for an attack of flu from its onset until the pigs are pretty well on the way to recovery. Flu spreads rapidly, while with pneumonia you will have a few pigs in the herd get sick and that is all. I never did see true pneu - monia spread. I have seen a lot of mistakes made where hogs came down with flu and the owner suspected that it was cholera and vaccinated the pigs. This proves very disastrous. MR. McDILL: We are sorry to have to stop this discussion, be - cause I realize it is probably the most important hog problem today. I want Mr. Loeffel to just say a few words about this disease. Mr. Loeffel. WM. J. LOEFFEL; I don't want to encroach upon the time of the other speakers who follow me. I think Dr. Alford has covered the subject very adequately. It appears to me that our llu usually commences shortly after fair time. I do not know how much the fair visitors are responsible for bringing the flu. Usually about the week after the fair everything in the college herd comes down with flu. The attack spreads like wild Are. My observation has been that the fattest hogs get it first. That was very strikingly brought out this fall. Now we had one lot of pigs fed ground wheat. These pigs were quite a little ahead of the tankage lot. The ground wheat pigs were the fattest, the corn pigs second, and then the tankage pigs. The wheat pigs got It first. The corn and barley pigs were very little affected. It is just an observation. There is quite a connection between the condition of the pigs. We found in one week some of our pigs would lose 23 pounds to the head. A 200-pound pig would lose more than 10% of its body weight. They recovered so that in two weeks they had made almost a complete recovery. When I say that they lost, 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p643">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION realize that a lot was due to shrinkage and not loss of flesh. That is all I wanted to say to you this morning. I thank you. MR. McDILL: We will have a little change of program. Mr. E. P. Brown of Davey has the reputation of being able to say some very pointed things and mixing with them considerable wit and color. He asked me to announce a change in his subject from that listed on the program: He will talk to you on "Some of the Spiritual Aspects of Pork." Mr. Brown. SOME OF THE SPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF FORK E. P. BROWN, Davey, Nebr. Mr. Chairman, Friends: I have been sitting here and have made more money In the last twenty minutes than I have made for several days. I can just see my meal ticket dwindling down "after all of these talks about bleary eyes, runny noses, stomach worms, etc. I think the aggregate saved in this crowd will be considerable. For that reason, I am very glad to suggest to you hog men and hog women some of the poetical, the ethical, the spiritual aspects of that subjects. As hog men we do not take back seats for anyone. I concede that the dairymen have it on us. They can prove by statistics that the dairy cow is the chief bulwark of the Nebraska prosperity. But they do not know the great debt that the world owes to the pig. That is why I asked our chairman to give me more territory than the pig in Nebraska. Since the gong of history there has been no progress in art, literature, or music that is not' associated with- the hog. Have you considered : the glory of Greece, and the glamor that was Home? The way Rome went out and hogged everything is all the evidence of the pig that we need. Along down the years of history where has there ever been an advance toward the freedom of man unless men full of patriotism, pious, and full of pork have stood up for their rights? Have you any doubt that it was patriots fed on pork that raised from the tyrant John the First? Have you any doubt that The signers of the Declara - tion of Independence had sausage for breakfast the morning they wrote their John Hancocks? Have you any doubt that it was Pilgrims filled with pork that first stepped on Plymouth Rock? Have you any doubt that it was there that the famous custom of bacon and eggs for breakfast started — there, with the. Pilgrims eating bacon and eggs on Plymouth Rock? Could there be any doubt that it was pork that defeated the complicated heads of Bunker Hill? Is there any doubt that </seg>
            <seg id="p644">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE it was pork — men full of pork — who went with Sherman on hiB famous march to the sea? You have all heard of the controversy about the plays written by Shakespeare. You know how It has been said that they were written by another. Whether It can be proved that the man called Francis Bacon wrote those plays or not, we can't say. Nevertheless, how could Bacon have been without the hog? So, there is considerable that we owe to pork. Why not? Who indulges more in literary work than the brood sow herself? So, I sing the praises of the hog. The world does not know and perhaps will not long remember the debt that our freedom, our literature, our art, our science, and our common nature owes to the hog. But you hog men — may I invite you to join in this slogan: Whether the American or the Nebraska pig, long may he weigh. I thank you. MR. McDILL: I don't believe anything need be said about appre - ciation of the talk we have just heard. It isn't often the fellow who acts as chairman appears on the program. It is my honor now to give before this great meeting, and we are certainly glad to see so many out, the winners of the Nebraska Pig Crop Contest. I think this is the seventh year this has been in operation. Interest is growing. I won't tell you much about this contest. I am simply going to call the winners up and present them with their Document of Recognition. This year we divided the con - test into two divisions; one for those who had six to fifteen sows and another for those who had sixteen or more. Mr. Honor Ochsner wins the contest again this year. In talking with a representative of the Journal-Stockman yesterday I told him that I thought the main reason for that was that Mr. Ochsner had done more than raise good hogs, he has given them good care and feed. He has selected and entered good sows each year. </seg>

McDILL: The next thing on the program is a discussion on hog shows. The first speaker on this program is Mr. Ed Rennick of Pilger who will discuss Hog Shows and the Purebred Breeder. HOG SHOWS AND THE PUREBRED BREEDER ED S. RENNICK I am certainly glad that our time is getting short. When Mr. McDill called me here a few weeks ago I couldn't understand him very well and I thought he said something about a hog calling contest. I can call hogs, but I can tell you it's a pretty hard job for me to make a speech. I have outlined my talk in three sections this morning. First: The things that make a hog show. Second : The things that break a hog show. Third: Things that can better our own Nebraska show. Under things that make a hog show, the first is good hogs. There is nothing more pleasing than to step on to a fair grounds and see an abundance of good hogs — regardless of color or breed, good hogs. Second, is competent judges. . There is nothing more pleasing on the part of the exhibitor than to drive out his herds in front of good, competent judges. When the judge places his cane upon a certain hog, he recognizes it as either a defeat or as a win: Third — adequate premium money. There is nothing that will draw more hogs to a </seg>
            <seg id="p648">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE, BOARD OK AGRICULTURE show than plenty of premium money well distributed. Fourth — good .sportsmanship. Good winners and good losers. You know, if some of you fellows perhaps have never had the experience of driving out a grand champion boar and having the judge place his cane on the other boar. Good sportsmanship comes in when you can take off your hat to the other fellow and say, "Well done." Fifth — Cooperation between fair managment and exhibitor and vice versa. A hearty cooperation between the fair management and the exhibitor is one thing that will help all hog shows and be much of an asset. - Now, things that break a hog show. Showing against unfair com - petition is one of the hardest things all - fair managements have to fight. There are people who will time after time enter hogs in. classes where they do not belong. That is one of the mean things of the hog show. Then there- is the carnival herd. You all know what a carnival hog herd is. A man 'who has gotten together several herds of hogs for the sole purpose of money. That is where most of our unfair competition comes from. They are going to get their money regardless of how they get it. When the fair season is over, nine - tenths of them send their show herds to the packer and are done for the year. They go out the next year and buy hogs front anyone who will sell them. They enter them in various classes as to size and not age. Another menace is men who go to the shows purposely to sell boars. While the rest of us are busy showing our hogs they are back in the pens selling them two for a quarter. Another menace is fair shows holding up exhibitors for exhibitor's fee and feed. There are some shows where by the time you pay your feed bills what premium money you have won is gone. Things that can better our show: One of the greatest things Nebraska shows should have is a good life futurity for every breed of hogs. I believe that would bring more men to our shows than any other one thing. It would naturally stimulate the hog business by bringing in the younger hogs. We can at least have twenty good futurity litters in each breed if we could but get a futurity in Ne - braska. They say we can have it if we put up our own money. If we were allowed to charge at the front end of the hog house we probably could get some money. Another thing that would be gratifying would be a new show pavilion. A place where we could have adequate room to drive our hogs and show them. Our present show ring is very inadequate — it Is dark — It is Hot roomy enough. By the time you get about twenty vicious boars in the room the judge himself generally gets up on the pen and looks at them. Then, the floor is concrete. It gets slick. </seg>
            <seg id="p649">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION the hogs can't stand up. The hogs become sore-footed after walking around on this concrete. We could remedy our present building by some skylights and that would help things materially. After all, we all realize that as Mr. Brown has said, there is very little to be added about the hog. The hog brings in at least one-third of Nebras - ka's wealth. I believe I am safe in saying that three-fourths of the farm mortgages are paid off by the hog and I should like to see the hog put on a plane with our cattle and our horse racing at our state fair. Thank you. MR. McDILL: Thank you, Mr. Rennlck. If you can call hogs as well as you can discuss the subject, you will win all contests. Mr. Rennick gave us the discussion from the standpoint of the purebred breeder. We feel there are three classes. Mr. J. J. R. Claasen, a man who shows carlot classes and wins, we have asked to discuss that .side of the show. Mr. Claasen. HOG SHOWS AND THE MARKET HOG PRODUCER J. J. R. CLAASEN There are a number of Important benefits to the hog grower who is not a breeder, from entering his hogs at the widely known -Western Livestock Shows. As a feeder of hogs, ones first impression of exhibiting is that this is only for a certain few, either breeders of registered hogs, or feeders who have a lot of time to fit and groom their hogs for such events. At least this was my idea some five years ago, at that time having never exhibited at any stock show. During the past few years I have had the pleasure of showing carlots of fat hogs at several national shows of the middle west, and the honor of winning some of the ribbons, and as a feeder of hogs, feeding for market only, and keeping no registered hogs for sale, am speaking from a feeder's viewpoint. We take no extra time to brush, oil and groom, no slopping, no extra feed,- other than regularly used to fatten the entire herd. The picking of hogs one feels the packers will like and sorting as to size and markings is something any feeder of hogs of any breed can do. From a financial standpoint, carlots of fat hogs that are in the money generally pay for the extra feed and expense of showing, and this is no little thing as the stock yard companies always charge plenty. But even If you are not in the money you profit by seeing different types of hogs shown and learn to know the kind the packer likes </seg>

One who follows the shows a few years should learn to be a good loser, as one can not always win, and being a good loser applies all through life. Clean and whole-hearted sportsmanship is an im - portant development in livestock raising as in any other branch of farming or contact with your fellow-men. As everyone loves a fat man, so everybody hates a poor loser. Exchanging of ideas, as to methods of raising and feeding, which one exhibitor always does with another, is also very helpful. The publicity a feeder gets, especially it he is lucky enough to win once in a while, might be very profitable to him. He becomes known generally as a raiser of good hogs and' frequently can dispose of hogs for breeding purposes that otherwise would sell on the market. As a summary: With very little extra time, no extra feed, care - ful selection of breeding stock, good judgment in sorting, any raiser of good hogs, of any breed, having a bunch of well finished hogs in the fall or winter around stock show time, might find it well worth the effort to exhibit them. 'If one follows this up a few years, he is sure to be producing better hogs, for the effort put forth, and getting more pleasure in the work. You gain whether you lose or win in attending livestock shows, is my advice from my experience.

            <seg id="p651">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS'- ASSOCIATION hoc; shows and i-h clubs K. C. FOUTS - Mr. Chairman, Friends: The subject given to me is the relation of 4-H club work to hog shows. I am going to hastily go over the idea of 4-H club work as I feel that it is not a new subject to you. I trust that while all of you are interested in hogs you have a little more interest in the boy and girl raising the hogs than the hog itself. A boy or a girl puts in several years in raising hogs. The hog is dead at the end of the season, but the hog leaves a great hole. The pig club serves a good many ways in bettering the youngster and it develops a good deal of county spirit and pride. The shows aid a great deal in the club work in that if there is nothing else to set up a goal or something for the youngster to* work all season for, they set up competition. Every youngster likes to get in a contest and receive some reward. So, the show is something that holds the interest throughout the year and keeps the boy and the girl ever - lastingly on the job when he feels like giving up. Let's take another look at it. Could the club work be of some help to the show? If you look back ten years to the Nebraska State Fair and compare the part of the show given over to the youngsters at that time with the part alloted to the boys and girls of today, 1 believe that while we owe a lot to the State Fair, the boys and girls have contributed a lot to the fair In every line of endeavor. There is another thing that I believe is of Interest to the swine breeders as well as to the boy and the girl. This is the much-discussed question of type. The boy and the girl planning on going to the hog s'how is bothered a great deal by the matter of type. We do not try to say that animal represents the type. We are trying to teach them to start a type of hogs and study the relation of a weanling pig to a six-months-old pig and on to maturity. Those of you who can remem - ber back to. the old types of hogs will undoubtedly agree with me when I say I am afraid we yielded too much to fancier hog production. Then, in more recent years there has been some dissatisfaction with the trade and the last two years there have been conferences of judges and breeders as to which way we should go in this matter of type. I attended a judging conference where this was defeated. Some of those judges of national reputation have steered clear of show rings. I assume they are waiting to see what the trend will be before they get into the wagon again. The attitude seemed to be that we should go to the hog of the old type. I think that last season's failure has kept us from going that far. We have had an innovation in our shows, and one which we owe a lot of credit to is our new show — the Ak-Sar-Ben. We do not have a fat swine show at our Nebraska State Fair. To help settle this </seg>
            <seg id="p652">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE. BOARD OF AGRICULTURE question of type in our minds what we need to find out is what is the relationship between the fat barrow or the market type to the breeding stock. We haven't followed that through very often. . The type of the six-months-old breeding boar might be compared to the type of the 14- to 16-months-old boar and then compare him to his father. We are starting in Seward county a pig club and I think that with the number of club boys we have we can overdo the pork market with club pigs. We urge our boys to take one or two top boars out of their litters. We take the rest and fatten out as barrows. What have we found out? This year the boy who had the' top on the winning Duroc litter at the State Fair also had the grand champion barrow of all breeds. We went to the Ak-Sar-Ben this fall and the boy had his fat barrow. That barrow was the grandson of the Vision, the Poland China grand champion at the Nebraska State Fair. This pig was first prize Poland China at the Nebraska State Fair. That pig weighed 275 pounds. At the Ak-Sar-Ben he weighed 375 pounds. From the first day of the State Fair he gained 3Vi pounds a day. A year ago one of our boys had the grand champion barrow. He has solved this problem for the practical farmer. Boiling it down, he has taken the height, he has taken the length, but with it he has spring of rib, depth of body and room. I think we are finding with our fat barrow shows that if we can stick to our length, we can stick to our height, but we must have a little more spring of rib and we won't worry about going back to the old times. In trying to get this question settled, we have another boy who was 1927 state pig club champion. He is farming in partnership with his father now. This year he had 42 pigs. This boy had about 18 or 20 barrows. I think he kept one boar from one litter and two or three from another out of the whole business. He took 12 of those barrows down to Ak-Sar-Ben. This boy went in and won the grand barrow and grand championship Duroc and did the same for all breeds represented. In one class we had two pens of three each in the heavy weight fat barrows. To show you how uniform those were, we tried to get two pens of three each. We took the three high ones and figured they would be the first. The judge put the ribbon on the other. The judge told us we could take any three and we would still have the same uniformity. I want to say that I believe we should encourage more counties, not so much having these boys raise breeding stock alone with the idea that they are going to sell a few boars at a fabulous sum, but really encourage them to raise two litters and keep a few for breeding and then go into the practical side and fatten out a few barrows. Compare the breeding hog with the market hog and I believe we will have our problem solved. I thank you. </seg>

Mr. Loeffel, as you all know, has charge of the hog work at this institution. MR. LOEFFEL: I take it that the audience which we have today is an indication that you are interested in the hog business. This is one of the most important businesses we have in this state. We have the hog show at the county fairs, the hog show at the state fair, and at the Ak-Sar-Ben show. Those will be just exactly what you make them. I have an idea that those hog shows should be in keeping with the importance of the hog industry in this state. I wish that every one of you would, during the coming year, make a special effort to exhibit some barrows at the Omaha show. I wish that we might have a bunch of breeders coming down. I wish that some more of you might be interested in showing at some of these good shows. Let's make the hog show in keeping with the dignity and importance of the Industry. MR.

            <seg id="p654">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE WINTERING CALVES ON CO1WJBELT RATIONS R. N. THALMAN I guarantee you one thing — this is the last time I will be . up here today. Yesterday afternoon we had a nice talk by Professor Wilson about practicing economy in agriculture. Right now I think we could easily practice some economy in the rations for wintering calves. Intensification of farming operations has made economy in cattle feeding one of the principal factors of financial success. Especially is this true in Eastern Nebraska where land is scarce and high in price. As a result of this high priced land, the farmer can net longer afford to devote most of his acreage to pasture land. The production of grains is the chief source of farm income produced by the soil. As a result, the cattle producer must either feed his grain to cattle in the fattening pen or utilize cheap roughages which are produced as by-products of general farming, by feeding them to stock cattle and breeding cattle. This is especially important during the winter months when pasture is not available and it is here that real economy in feeding oprations must be in evidence. The cattle man should, therefore, spend much time in thoughtful planning as to the best methods of carrying the breeding herd and stocker cattle through the winter. Because Nebraska produces, as it does, a tremendous amount of rough feed, the bulk of the ration should consist largely of farm grown roughages; feeds which have little or no market value. There is no best. feed or combination of feeds that will give the best results on all farms. A ration that will be satisfactory under your conditions may be entirely unsatisfactory under mine. I am convinced that a breeding herd maintained for the purpose of producing home grown beef calves will not be a profitable enter - prise if the ration which they receive is made up of grain and fifteen dollar alfalfa hay. It is even harder to see a profit in such an enter - prise when the price of cattle is as low as.lt is this year. I by no means wish to give the impression that a herd of beef cows has no place on the Nebraska farm, but merely wish to emphasize the fact that good judgment in feeding operations Is necessary where farming is intensified as it Is in eastern Nebraska. The problem of maintaining the breeding herd is, however, not so Important since most men who are still in the business realize breeding stock can be maintained quite profitably during the winter months on roughages alone. Some even realize that the feeding of a protein concentrate is sometimes advisable under certain conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p655">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION Before selecting any particular type o( ration, it is espccwnj necessary that the feeder first be classified according to the objects which he has in mind. Perhaps the first class of feeder is the man with the breeding herd attempting to produce his own calves, keeping up the fertility of his soil, and utilizing such feeds that may be pro - duced on the farm with little or no market value. The second class of feeder Is the man that is wintering stocker cattle. This type of feeder may have one of three objects in mind, i. e., he may have bought calves in the fall with the thought of wintering them on roughages and selling as feeders the following spring. He may have in mind carrying the calves through the winter with the thought of summer feeding on grass or even in dry lot, having the calves ready for market any time from the fifteenth of July to the first of November. A different method of handling may prove best for each type of feeder. Furthermore, our problems in eastern Nebraska are much different than those of the range man. It would seem that the success of any feeding operation where roughages are to make up the bulk of the feed will come in the future to be more and more de - pendent upon the utilization of the corn plant. When our corn crop is harvested, approximately half or two-thirds of it is left standing in the field in the form of roughage. This year the possibility ot rough feed is proportionately greater because of the failure of many fields to make grain. Unfortunately the corn plant as it is taken from the field is relatively unpalatable to livestock. Possibly one of the reasons why only twenty-seven per cent of the stover produced annually is fed to livestock. In the past, most of that which has been fed was consumed by mature cattle. Feeders are not in agree - ment as to the possibilities of wintering younger cattle, especially calves, on the corn plant. Experienced feeders have even made this statement, that calves do not handle fodder corn economically, and as a result the majority of calves going to market each fall return to the feed lot in which they are to be full fed on grain in order to fatten them as soon as possible. As a result of this practice the fat cattle market during the spring months is usually overrun with finished cattle. The wintering of calves on coarse feeds is a practice that is relatively new, and as a result little attention has been given to the processing of these feeds which would make them available to the calves. Furthermore, it has been only during the past few years that intensification of agriculture has progressed to a point where economy in feeding operations is the principal factor in the success of the feeders. Since the corn plant is a feed available to nearly every eastern Nebraska, feeder, it is evident that attention must be given toward ways of utilizing this abundant and cheap roughage. Our studies at the Nebraska station during the last two years have led to the conclusion that the corn plant can be made available, and, </seg>
            <seg id="p656">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE furthermore, economical in the wintering ration for any class of cattle, but not without processing. One of the most common ways of processing the corn plant .is through the use of the silo, regardless of the fact that silage is not popular among Nebraska feeders. However, it has proven its worth and undoubtedly holds a prominent place in wintering operations in eastern Nebraska. I am not afraid that you will contradict me when I say that silage is a succulent and palatable feed. For the breeding herd or for stock calves silage holds a prominent place as a method of utilizing the corn plant. This is especially true this year when so many fields failed to produce a satisfactory yield of grain. We have recognized this fact at the Nebraska station and our breeding herd this year is being carried through the winter largely upon a silage ration. Silage contains about the right percentage of grain and rough - ness for the breeding herd, or for stock calves. It should be remem - bered, however, that silage is low in protein and therefore, it is necessary to balance the ration with either some nitrogeneous roughage such as alfalfa, clover, or soy beans, or a nitrogeneous concentrate such as linseed or cottonseed cake. When alfalfa is high in price and relatively scarce it would pay to feed a small allowance of some protein concentrate. If cottonseed cake is used:, one pound per head daily will turn the trick very nicely. It will take from two to three pounds of alfalfa to balance a full feed of silage. In the case of stock calves a good winter grain could be expected on the above ration and the calves would come through the winter in good shape for summer feeding. Last winter calves wintered at this station received a full feed of silage and one pound of cottonseed cake and gained 252 pounds in 135 days, a daily gain of 1.86 pounds. They produced' only 40 pounds less gain during this time than a similar group of calves receiving a full feed of shelled corn and alfalfa. A second way in which the corn plant could be made available to calves is in the form of corn fodder. The objection to small cattle on the score that they can not utilize rough feed is substantiated here, provided the fodder is not ground. Calves weighing 350 pounds will not make efficient use of whole fodder, especially is this true when the fodder is fed in racks. If scattered on clean frozen ground some will be eaten but it is surely not an economical practice since a large percentage of it is refused and tramped into the mud by the calves. Grinding, however, eliminates this waste, and in the ground form calves will make efficient use of the corn stalk. Grinding costs will vary depending upon the power, capacity of the grinder and con - dition of the fodder. The cost will probably range from $1.50 per ton to $2.50 per ton. Ground fodder can be fed In bunks and if ground fine enough to Just crack the kernels, practically none of it will be refused by the </seg>
            <seg id="p657">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION calves. True, fodder is not as palatable as silage but this factor is of very little importance since at no time in our experience have the calves refused their feed. In fact, this year, we have been unable so far to get 450 pound calves to consume as much as three pounds of alfalfa hay when ground fodder was fed, free choice. Fodder, like silage, is in itself an unbalanced ration, therefore, a protein supplement is necessary. This supplement can be fed in the form of legume hay or a concentrate. When alfalfa costs $15 per ton, cottonseed cake at the present price would prove a more economical way to balance the ration. Calves fed at this station on ground fodder and one pound of cake gained approximately 1 1-5 pounds per day, a very satisfactory gain for a wintering ration. Whether or not a man wishes to use silage, fodder, or alfalfa with a limited grain ration, or some other roughage depends, as pre - viously stated, upon the object which he has in mind. For the man with the breeding herd silage probably furnishes the best method of utilizing the corn plant. We especially recommend silage for the man who has on his farm a silo already constructed. If, however, the cost of constructing a standing silo is prohibitive, a trench silo may be constructed in its stead. We have two trench silos at the Station this year and they have given very satisfactory results. The silage from the trench is not noticeably different than that from the standing silo. The trench has this advantage, it can be constructed upon rented farms, ' because of the little time and expense involved. It is also very easily and economically filled. Whether or not a man feeds silage or corn fodder to stock calves makes little difference if he wishes to feed them out himself. Silage will produce more gain and less time will be required in finishing the calves than where corn fodder is used. Where a silo is not available the grinder makes fodder feeding in some cases more economical. When the feeder wishes to fatten his calves on grass the following summer it makes no difference which he uses if time is not a factor. The fodder-fed calves will need approximately thirty extra days feeding but will not make appreciably greater gains. If the calves are to be sold in the spring as feeders then the fodder may return just as much or more profit than the silage by virtue of the fact that the thinner calves will sell at a higher price as feeders than the fleshier ones. The difference in price between the thin fodder calves and the fleshier silage calves will in most cases be sufficient to more than make up for the extra gain made on silage. Because of the fact that Nebraska produces as it does such large quantities of corn, hay and other coarse feeds the cattle man need have few worries, whether he is a producer or a feeder when the winter season approaches. Cattle are adapted to the utilization of roughage and by taking advantage of this fact the cost of the wintering </seg>
            <seg id="p658">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE laiiuu for stock cattle and calves can be cut to a minimum. In addi - tion to cutting costs, satisfactory gains will be made, provided thought - ful consideration has been given to balancing the ration. MR. HILDEBRAND: If there are any questions you care to ask Mr. Thalman, I am sure he will be glad to answer them for you.

Then along comes some disease that is new — some disease that upsets bur plans. It is wasn't for our veter - inarians and animal pathologists all our efforts would be in vain. I am sure we shall all be very glad to hear at this time from Dr. C. H. Hays, state veterinarian, on vaccinations — good and bad. Dr. Hays. VACCINATIONS— tiOOD AND BAH DR. C. H.

Vaccinations — Good and Bad, might suggest argument or at least ;i conflict of opinions to be expressed through this discussion. May I assure you in the beginning that such is fartherest from the object, that no such treat is in store for any if I succeed with handling the subject as I hope to. It will be my expressed Intention to present only personal opinions for what they may be worth based upon observa - tions and experiences and upon certain research investigations not personal. Fundamentals will be dealt with as apply to the protection against disease among livestock more than specific applications or theories that may surround vaccinations. This discussion could be out quite short and yet deal rather effectively with the subject If the discussion were to be limited alone to questions and answers as would come from a close application to the title. However, we shall take the opportunity of making some comments, pertinent we believe. In this connection, and that will possibly recjulte your expectations In some particulars for the attention required. It is quite generally appreciated by those engaged in livestock production and allied activities, that go to make up a livestock industry, that there occurs each year. quite a considerable waste to agriculture by reason of losses among livestock in production and handling on </seg>
            <seg id="p659">?■ NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION Nebraska farms. The volume of such waste can only be estuuaiuu by calculations which are available from certain sources but a reason - ably accurate measure for the purpose. Several months ago represen - tatives of a firm engaged in the operation of a rendering establishment for the disposal of the carcasses of domestic animals not intended for human consumption made some observations that it is desirable to repeat, though I have used these on several occasions, to indicate the enormity of waste that does occur among livestock in Nebraska each year. These representatives mentioned were at the time considering and had decided upon an expansion of their plant, therefore were interested in determining the available materials for rendering pur - poses in the area of their operation. They were, consequently, not prone to make extravagant estimates because their money was to be invested in the expansion and not that of others. It was estimated by this company that there are available annually from the eastern one-half of Nebraska 150,000,000 pounds of dead animals for such rendering purposes. Later a more actual measure from the same source showed that during a single month from one county alone this plant received 200,000 pounds of hog carcasses. The company esti - mated that this amount represented only approximately ten per cent of the total available in the territory. This waste in animals is largely the result of disease or disease processes. Some time ago Dr. L. Van Es of the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of the College of Agriculture made a calcula - tion as to the cost of disease occurring among domestic animals to the livestock industry of our state. His figures showed that at least $15,000,000 was thus consumed. This included besides waste in dead animals,, service costs and treatment expenses incident to handling the disease problems. Dr. Van Es made the additional observation that ninety per cent of such waste was preventable, though not all could be prevented within reasonable economics. Our next logical consideration would be the preventable factors and how is prevention to be obtained. Disease from specific infections, communicable from animal to animal, is probably the more active factor in causing this waste. By directing, and more or less limiting our attention to such causes, we will keep pretty clearly within the limits of the title of our dis - cussion. The fight against and prevention of infection of disease may be dlvlsioned for our convenience into two parts based upon the application of procedure by which we must combat the cause. In the first part prevention requires that susceptible animals be pro - tected against the infection by preventing Infective materials from entering the animal body. Exposure and invasion of the animal body to infections to which the species may be susceptible must be pro - tected against. The second relates to placing the animal body in such </seg>
            <seg id="p660">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a. male as to be tolerant or resistant to the infection or infections to which such species of animal may be susceptible when exposure or invasion occurs. Both of these principles have been adopted in live - stock sanitary practices which have been successfully applied time and again. It is not always a question of choice as to which will be applied because the nature of the disease infection .governs and whether either plan will be successful depends on such "factor in an appreciable extent. On first thought many are prone to state that it is impossible to prevent the invasion of susceptible animals by infection of disease under farm conditions. This would be true in a large measure were attention directed only against the individual animal rather than herds or groups of animals, or if attempt were made only to restrict ex - posure and invasion by holding or attempting to hold animals in quarantine away from disease without any attempt being made to otherwise lessen the opportunity of exposure, thus allowing the disease among animals to run rampant. It is much the more practical, and success will obtain in a greater measure where efforts are directed at destroying infections at their source, and thus prevent exposure to other animals that may be susceptible. Today in the United States and Canada there is in progress and has been for a period of approximately ten years the most elaborate and comprehensive work of livestock sanitation that has yet been devised or attempted against disease among domestic animals. The fight against animal tuberculosis as you have come to see it in Ne - braska is based entirely upon our first mentioned principle, that or eradicating the Infection of the disease. The fight has been primarily one against the disease occurring among cattle as a source of Infection to which other livestock, as well as cattle, and man, are susceptible. While the instrument used for determining the presence of Infection, the testing of cattle has been the more demonstrative, you whose herdB have been tested have actually carried on after such tests were completed the procedure of eradication in causing a destruction of the diseased animals and a cleaning and disinfection of contam - inated premises. The progress that has been made and success attained have proven the practicability of thi work, and warrant its completion to include the whole of the United States under the exacting care and completeness that has governed in the development of this work thus far. The second procedure specifies the establishment within the body of an animal of a resistance or tolerance against the specific infection of a given disease, and is commonly referred to as an Immunity. The application of this procedure has been developed with the knowledge that infection of certain diseases invading the animal body creates a resistance to future invasion from like infection. This was first noted </seg>
            <seg id="p661">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 . ASSOCIATION when recovery from certain infectious diseases was followed by future immunity against the reoccurrence of such disease in the individual previously affected. For the purpose of this discussion details regard - ing immunity may be omitted. It will suffice to state that various ways and means, and different procedures have been dveloped for creating immunity through artificial exposure from the use of special biologic products. It should be appreciated, however, in order to have a correct understanding in this matter that all infections through their presence in the body of the susceptible animal do not establish a resistance, tolerance or immunity against the disease from the specific infection of invasion. It appears that many engaged in the livestock production have come to an apparent belief that every disease condi - tion with which livestock become affected is potentially amenable to vaccination procedure. From this much false security has been created among animal husbandmen. Persons handling. livestock may familiarize themselves with the possibility and probability of immuni - zation against disease; it is recommended that a better plan would be to place confidence and become dependent upon agencies of service that are equipped with the knowledge regarding these matters. It would be wonderful were it possible that through a system of Immunity disease could be prevented regardless of the character and type of infection. Such a millennial happening is only a phantom. Because there are a certain few diseases cause for the greater part of the waste among livestock and which can be protected against and thus reduce the enormity of the cost at present borne by those engaged In the production of domestic animals, a proper application of the means at hand should not be denied. Perhaps, the more extensively applied immunization in combat - ing animal disease has had to do . with hog cholera. Through the inoculation of the virus of hog cholera simultaneous with anti-hog - cholera serum it has been made possible to create in susceptible swine an immunity or resistance against the infection and prevent damage as result from exposure to the virus of hog cholera. Equally as ex - tensively used in Nebraska, though not to as great an amount, is the establishment of immunity against black leg among cattle. The efficiency of this protection is generally recognized by all cattlemen producing or handling cattle under range, semi-range or pasture con - ditions. These two diseases, with a limited Immunizing procedure against anthrax, are the only animal diseases of common' occurrence in Nebraska which can be effectively controlled by rendering the ani - mal body resistant, to the invasion of the specific infection. Because of the successful Immunization against these commoner diseases, attempts have been made to combat through similar im - munizing procedure other infections attacking animal life. From such attempts there has not heen developed as yet any immunizing pro- </seg>

BOARD OF AGRICULTURE uu .e against the several other different diseases by which the live - stock industry is beset and by which serious losses are occasioned. Particular mention would be made to the filth-born infections common to the permanent feed-lots, especially involving swine. The failures or limited successes of these efforts have led to impressions suggested by the title for this discussion, Vaccinations — Good and Bad. On this point we would state that as between vaccinations specific for different diseases, these cannot be correctly classified as Indicated by the title into good and bad vaccinations. Vaccination is or is not, in other words animals are immuned or are not as measured by field ellicien - cies, in other words by results. Vaccinations of recognized efficiency for a given disease, such as for hog cholera or black leg, might by some be' classified as good or bad. But again our contention is that the vaccination to establish immunity must be classed as positive with no .place for a -negative.. Good and bad vaccinations as relate to the use of anti-hog cholera serum have come to be of common usage.. In the use of anti-hog cholera serum and hog cholera virus on swine protective immunity is caused to be created in the blood in the body of the particular swine so treated. This is dependent upon the stimulation or activation caused by the virus, the serum in the instance being used to protect against the development of the infective materials introduced and which latter would otherwise cause disease. There may be a slight disturbance as a result of the invading virus to a nearer point of disease production in some individuals than in others, but the success of the treatment depends upon the anti-serum protecting against the disease producing quality of the virus. If a proper balance is secured, the objective sought is obtained. However, there is no measure by which the degree or the amount of the immunity can be determined. The only measure is the after exposure to the virus of hog cholera and under field conditions this is limited to whether the treated swine develop hog cholera. If they do not, the vaccination becomes accepted as good. If, however, the animals that have been so treated become affected with hog cholera later, we are prone to classify the vaccina - tion as bad. This system is crude for determining the efficiency but on the whole satisfactory from a commercial standpoint and for all practical purposes. This same reasoning as to good and bad vaccination may be applied to other immunizations used in livestock. Vaccinations are administered, and the result by which measure of their goodness or badness is made is whether or not the animals later become affected with the particular disease against which attempt has been made to protect. Many factors enter into the immunizing procedures, including in particular the products to be applied, and the technique and other knowledge essential for securing a proper application. The condition </seg>

We are impressed with the success that has obtained in face of the mass work under which these procedures are applied. Without these various factors, all in proper relations, immunization that we seek to obtain may not be realized. The fraili - ties of the human, therefore, place in a large measure immunization as bad or good, though the operator is usually prone not to accept any responsibility for the badness of the thing- with which he may be related. Withal, wonderful success has been obtained and sufficient reward resulted to Justify the more general and systematic use of anti-hog cholera serum and hog cholera virus for protecting against the great waste. that continues to be caused by hog cholera. We would appreciate in this discussion that a distinction be recog - nized as between vaccinations and the use of other serlological mate - rials, such as anti-serums. The latter are being used against disease rather extensively and have come into favor to quite an appreciable extent. Vaccination is basic to establish an immunity and is not a treatment for primary curative purposes. It is a treatment to produce a resistance that will prevent or protect against the infection of the given specific disease. Anti-serums are used for curative purposes to retard or interrupt the progress of the invasion by. infections that may be cause for a specific disease. Attempts have been made against disease among animals with anti-serums but usually the costs make the practice prohibitive. While anti-hog cholera serum is a true anti - serum possessing protective qualities derived from the body of one animal and transferred to another because of the specific protection possessed, it has not been found a success when used solely for cura - tive purposes. However, it has been extremely Valuable when used as indicated simultaneously with the infecting virus in establishing a protection against that virus. Special mention in conclusion will be made to two particular problems presented by disease among cattle which are of very general interest. The first pertains to abortions as result of specific infection Bangs disease, contagious abortion. Description of the disease must give way in this discussion to treatment. Medicinal agencies of one sort or another have been demonstrated as useless and without value in combating the infection of abortion disease. This statement is made without reservation, and although it might necessarily be modified at some future time by discoveries to be made, such is not promising. Attempts have been made to create a tolerance or immunity to abor - tion infection among cattle by immunizing procedures. First, bac - terins, or the killed organisms of the disease, were used, but these have finally though slowly been accepted as of no value for combating the infection. Later virus, or the little organisms, have been used for Immuniza - tion purposes. Even though a certain measure of immunity or toler- </seg>
            <seg id="p664">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE „„ ,aay be established from living culture vaccination for abortion disease, because of the disaster that may attend its use upon pregnant - animals, there is a question as to its practical field application. Where the vaccine of disease producing virus is to be used, its application should be registered alone to virgin heifers. Even though an immunity or tolerance results in the animals so treated, it has been found that the infection may remain virulent in the body of the treated animal and becomes an active, source .for the spread of the infection later. A lot or herd of cattle so treated remains an infection source, positive to tests for the disease. More recently attenuated infection, not capa- ' ble of producing disease, has come into use. Such use has only reached the experimental stage, and, therefore, cannot be recommended at this time as a relief measure for vaccination against abortion infection. However, the application of certain sanitary practices especially practical, we believe, under range or semi-range conditions for com - bating the abortion infection can be recommended. The sanitation practices recommended when adopted will reduce the amount of abor - tions and can be the basis for creating an abortion infection-free con - dition if faithfully and diligently applied. The greater part of our cattle owners are interested most in relief through the reduction and prevention of the abortion incidence. The loss of calves is the most serious consideration. The sanitation plans and methods to accom - plish this will be even more far reaching than the effect upon the amount of waste from abortions, and a reduction in the amount of infection will result. Our last reference is . to a group of conditions rather than a specific disease. We have in mind the diseased conditions that attend the shipping of cattle through public stockyards, or otherwise from more or less similar handling elsewhere, and also the diseased con - dition that is met among animals allowed access to cornstalks, com - monly called Cornstalk Disease. These conditions result in a rather uniformity of disease processes but it has not yet been possible to classify them as specific, measured by the usual scientific procedure. The demonstration of a specific infection by which the condition can be reproduced in the susceptible species of animal has not been suc - cessful. Organisms recognized of disease producing potentialities have been Isolated from the tissues of the affected animals in both of these disease conditions and as a result immunization procedures have been attempted. Most of such attempts have had as a background the bacterial organism recognized as causative of hemorrhagic septlcemia. The presence of this disease has not been conclusively demonstrated as cause for such conditions by accepted scientific procedures to a degree that it is justified to accept the disease as cause for losses in the instances except of possible rare occurrence. The use of vaccines and other biological agents against the so - called shipping fever and similar affections among cattle passing </seg>
            <seg id="p665">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION through public .stockyards have been without positive value. Kx - posures and other depressing influences, such as dietary derangements, incident to traffic of livestock in our marketing scheme appear to be creative of disorders that become the primary cause for the disturb - ances observed. If infections do play a part, and their mere presence indicates sucH possibility, it appears that they are secondary rather than primary disturbers. In "cornstalk disease" biologic agents to date offered for pre - ventive or corrective purposes have come to be recognized as of little or no value in combating the malady. Our only recommendation at this time is to keep cattle from such exposure by not allowing them access to the cornstalks. You may say this is not practical, and it may not be, but you will have to take your chance and gamble with the possibility of the disease processes destroying your cattle. Twenty - two years ago there was published by the University of Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, P.ress Bulletin No. 27, regarding losses from Cornstalk Disease which in the conclusions offer sanitation suggestions that we repeat herewith because of their definite value, which stand impeachable as the day uttered that long ago as the only measures which afford the desired relief. These conclusions were as follows: 1. The farmers of the central counties of Nebraska, unless they are to lose the valuable forage of their corn - stalks, must choose between the two alternatives: (a) Cutting the stalks when the corn ripens and shocking them in the field. (b) Pasturing the standing stalks with the knowl - edge that they are liable to lose as many as one-twentieth of their cattle In an unfavorable season. 2. No precaution and no feed or combination of feeds has been found to prevent or to mitigate the losses from cornstalk disease. In dealing with the shipping problems, the matter of sanitation prac - tices to govern in the traffic handling and immediately preceding and following shipment must be given serious consideration. Again you remark these changes are not obtainable, then again we can only say you must gamble with the death dealing factors which you become party to. These gambles have been very costly, and will no doubt become more serious as a greater amount of livestock comes into the opera - tions and as the channels of traffic become more congested and make palative methods of less avail. Preventable medicine through its many miraculous procedures will never become so efficacious that relief will obtain thereby to replace that which must be had from </seg>

Medicinal agents in their proper relation will be essential but our pendulum of knowledge must be properly applied to keep the correct balance. AIR. HILDEBRAND: I am sure we all appreciated the comments of Dr. Hays. Now, before Dr. Hays leaves us there are probably some Questions you would like to ask him. A rather lengthy discussion followed this — a great deal of interest was shown in vaccination and a number of men gave their experiences along this subject. Dr. Hays answered questions. MR. HILDEBRAND: I am sure we have all appreciated this discussion because it is very important to each and every man raising livestock. You have heard a talk this morning by a gentleman who has been doing some work with wintering calves. Now, we will have another talk by a man from the college. I am sure, gentlemen, that with the changes which have been taking place this is' going to be a very interesting and Instructive talk. Mr. McDill will talk to you about creep feeding calves. Mr. McDill. CREEP FEEDING CALVES PAUL McDILL Assistant State Extension Agent in Animal Husbandry I have one advantage over Dr. Hays. I am going to talk to you about a subject which not many of you have had experience with, while Dr. Hays was talking about a subject which most of you have had more or less experience with. On the other hand, I am at a disadvantage because Dr. Hays has had a lot of experience along the line which he discussed. I must admit I have had no experience with this subject. What I say is simply what I have been able to learn from men who have been creep feeding calves in the state. 1 spent a day with Professor Moxley of Kansas learning about the creep feeding contest which he is conducting at Kansas. You- know, Moxley has spent quite a bit of time on creep feeding work and he is familiar with it. I am going to read you a little article which appeared in the Star recently. A newspaper reporter got a hold of a paper that I was going to give you and published it. I will read part of a clipping that was written in reply to that article of mine. Now, it happens that this gentleman had some reason for writing this little criticism, because this reporter who got the article put it all in except one paragraph. The reporter either thought that wasn't </seg>
            <seg id="p667">NEBRASKA IMrROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION important or else he figured everyone knew what creep feeding who. so he left it out. That paragraph is where I want to start. What is creep feeding? You see, the gentleman was justified in his criticism. Creep feeding lambs and pigs has been a common practice for many years, but the practice of creep feeding calves is rather new. Here in Nebraska just a few men have tried it. We have no accurate experimental data on the subject under Nebraska conditions. How - ever, the experimental work done on the subject of fattening cattle of various ages proves very definitely that the efficiency of gain de - creases as the animal grows older. In other words, calves make as much gain on sixty pounds of feed as yearlings do on seventy pounds of feed, as 2-year-olds do on eighty pounds of feed, or as 3-year-olds do on ninety pounds of feed. Experimental work done in neighboring states and cow-men's ex - periences in Nebraska indicate clearly that the suckling calf makes more efficient use of grain than he will six months later in the feed lot. Creep feeding is a method of raising calves so that they are induced to eat grain while nursing their mothers. The cow's milk plus grain produces maximum weight and finish in the shortest pos - sible time. There are two very good reasons for creep feeding. First it is a low cost of production method, and the second reason is that the system produces what the public wants; namely, small cuts of well finished beef. Early spring or late winter calves creep feed the best, because the calves learn to eat grain quicker in the feed yard than when on pasture and another advantage for the early calf is that the cow maintains a good milk flow longer. The first two months the maternal instinct of the cow induces a good supply of milk, then she goes on to good spring grass which gives milk production a boost and holds 'up until fly time. Thus the early calf gets a much longer suckle than does his brother born two or three months later. The advantages of creep feeding are as follows^ 1. It adds weight to the calf. February and March calves will eat about 10 bushels of grain by weaning time. April calves will eat about 7 bushels of grain by weaning time. May calves will eat about 3 bushels of grain by weaning time. Each bushel of corn or its equivalent in other grains will produce 10 or more pounds of beef. 2. It adds finish to the calf. Creep-fed calves sell for from $1.00 to ?2.00 more per cwt. than calves not creep fed. 3. It saves shrink at weaning time, the calves go on to the finishing feed without the usual backset. </seg>

Mr. Derrick will be out in the Held early this spring attempting to make contacts with county agents, ranchers, and farmers in getting this started. iMR. HILDEBRAND: This is a very interesting subject, I am sure. It is something new. I am glad to have Mr. McDill admit that Nebraska is a better state than Missouri. I am sure we are all more than pleased to have with us again this* morning a gentleman whom some of you recall got down here several years ago. He is a man from our neighboring country— Canada. He is going to talk to you about beef this morning. Mr. Duncan Marshall of Toronto, Canada. BEEP DUNCAN MARSHALL Mr. Chairman, Ladies, Gentlemen: I thought that in the begin - ning I just might say a word about silos. A speaker here this morn - ing told you something about constructing a cheap silo — a pit silo. This is very satisfactory for certain purposes and under certain con - ditions, depending a good deal upon the weather, the soil, and the place you have of locating it. I built a silo on my farm some seven - teen years ago that cost very little money and has been most effective up to date. We bought just about the cheapest lumber we could. It was full of knots but it had no holes. We just began by nailing these boards one on the other with 4-inch spikes. That will just give you air enough to get around in a silo fifteen feet in diameter. This silo is very efficient and inexpensive. You can buy cheap lumber and build it yourself. It stands out and freezes less than most of the patented silos that people pay high prices for. I am sure it didn't cost $50.00 to put it up. I would build them, of common 2x4 lumber and spike together in this way if I were to build fifty silos. Now I have been asked to say something about beef cattle here this morning and I realize that I am in a part of the country where people are engaged largely in the business of breeding and feeding beef cattle and that perhaps any one of you knows a good deal more about them than I do. I have been buying and selling and breeding these cattle for nearly thirty or forty years and I am bound to say one has a good deal to learn, no matter how long he stays in the busi - ness. If I were going to offer a suggestion to your organization it would be that they utilize the Federal Farm Board for one purpose. They have funds which they could use to conduct a meat advertising cam - paign. I believe that there is not a city in the United States that </seg>
            <seg id="p669">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION the consumption of beef couldn't be doubled Inside of twelve months by a proper advertising campaign. Half of the people who eat beef don't know anything about it. I do not believe there would be any - thing so effective either in this country or in mine during the next six months as a campaign of this sort. Teach people more about beef — teach them how to buy beef. Educate them so they know a good piece of beef when they see it at the butcher shop. When we do that, I think we will get away from this baby beef craze. We will not get back to the heavy beef we once had because it is unprofitable, because it takes too long to grow it out, but I believe we would get a better class of beef than we have now. . Baby beef largely came about because people lived in apartment houses with kitchens bo small that they couldn't get a big roast in them. A good many men went into the butcher business who didn't know a hind quarter from a fore quarter and thought they would be able to trim out cuts to suit the people who ordered from them. We should teach our butchers how to trim carcasses and get attrac - tive cuts from them. We must teach them to fix their display cases so they will appeal to the customers who come to their shops. I have been finding from a survey that the butchers are cutting up much larger carcasses now than they were a year or two ago. Once their people get a taste for good beef they don't want any more of your half-fed stuff. They want beef with a little flavor to it. There is just one country that I know anything about where they know beef and that is in 'England and Scotland. Th other day Mr. Legge in his address said the Argentine beef was only half the price of the beef' in Europe. Why is that? It is because the English and the Scotch are a good judge of beef and a greater part of the Argentine beef goes to Britain. The people there know good beef when they get it. They won't eat Argentine beef if they can afford to buy home - raised beef. Why? Because the Scotch beef has a flavor to it. The Argentine beef Is chilled before shipping and when it thaws, the juice runs out. I have never yet seen the choicest Canada beef we can send to Scotland sell closer than six pence less than what the home-cured product brought. These people know what good beef Is. These people, by a long process, just as they have been trained by three, four, or five generations to be efficient enough farmers on the land to be able to make enough from year to year to be able to buy the land, have established a system of agriculture in this country which I think is second to none in any country In the world. Their Ideas and ours have grown very rapidly, while there are people from over the world, many from the continent of Europe, who have never been accustomed to eating beef as we know it, and — so, the consumer's knowledge is very impractical indeed. </seg>
            <seg id="p670">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE i do not believe the time ever was so ripe as it is at the present time to educate our people in the choice of meat, to get them to understand what high-class beef is and to recognize it when they see it. When we do this, then the consumption of beef will be largely increased. We will have to leave the whole problem of eating meat to human nature. Most of us who have been pretty generous meat eaters all our lives find ourselves in a pretty healthy condition at the present time. Most people like meat if they can get good meat, but most people don't know enough about meat to know when they get good meat. From time to time we find women worrying about what kind of meat to serve for dinner. Possibly they have invited guests for the meal. They will not buy beef because they are afraid it will be tough. The result is that they perhaps get fowl or some - thing else for the dinner party, when if they knew they could get good beef, they would prefer it. I do not believe there is a better time than the present to educate the housewives of America as to how to get good beef. The beef that comes from the Argentine is very, very cheap. It hasn't got the flavor because it is grass fed. On top of that, it comes chilled. You cannot. put ice into beef, even in effective chilling, and hope to have it come out and have the same flavor. In Great Britain the importation of beef does not affect the prices of the home-grained product. We have found in our shipping of live cattle during the last four or five years to Britain that even though we think these cattle are very well finished, very few of them are slaughtered on arrival. Almost all of them go into the feed lot for four to five weeks and that puts them into the class of home-raised beef and they get the top. price. There was one man in the Dundee locality where they are large potato growers who fed three to four hundred head of beef cattle during the year and milked 150 cows. He told me he didn't want anything but heavy steers. He wanted every one weighing 1,20(1 pounds. He wanted them heavy so that he would have plenty of manure in his yards. His land was heavy and he wanted heavy manure. So, there is a market in that country today for practically every kind of cattle. Many cattle are fattened on pasture in the old country. The pastures which they have there are, of course, a lot different from anything we have been able to produce in this country yet. The way they begin to make a pasture there is a pretty clear indication of the results they will get. In Scotland a farmer- wouldn't sow less than 42 pounds of seed for his grass pasture. The gains they put on in some of these grass pastures without feeding any or very little cake would surprise some of us who feed cattle on wheat and corn In this country. </seg>
            <seg id="p671">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION Somebody here was discussing this creep feeding of calves anil the question of marketing these calves when about a year old or possibly a little over. We have a system among the farmers in western Canada which has worked out pretty well. There are men in Canada who raise 2,500 calves each fall. They conceived of the idea that they would like to get rid of the calves and instead of wintering steers, feed a few more cows. So they made a contract which worked out very satisfactorily. These contracts have been limited only by the number of calves that could be gotten. The rancher furnishes the calves to the farmer. A dollar a calf is put on them for insurance. The calves are put into the hands of farmers by the ranchers without any payment of money. A man is appointed who visits these feed lots at least once a week, consults with the feeder and gives some advice. Then these calves are sold in the spring, and supposing they bring what they did last spring, the man who feeds them gets lVfec on their weight when they are weighed in. They are supposed to 'weigh 400 pounds when they are put into the feed lot. That is, if th calves weigh in at 400 pounds, he gets $6.00 for feeding. If they weigh out at 650 pounds, he gets the full value of the 250 pounds at 12c. This plan doesn't require any money to finance it. The rancher has sold these calves at a good profit not only to himself but to the man who feeds them also. The result is this is a profitable enterprise both to the man who is breeding the calves and the man who is feeding the calves. The success of that last year is evident in that the number is over doubled this year and we believe that it will work out as a cooperative system of feeding calves off the ranges in the province of Alberta. We made some mistakes by permitting home - steaders to go into this land that never should have been farmed. During the last four or five years the Government has attempted to remedy this by giving the rangers again the 20-year lease that, they had in the old days. After all, there is a part of our country there that is adapted to ranging and not to farming. We try to make a clear distinction between farming and ranging business. If we can work out this system of cooperation by which the farmers who are not raising very many cattle and who are perhaps milking a few cows but would like to feed a few cattle will be able to do this, then we will have solved some of our problems in the provinces of Canada. I think that system definitely worked out between the men who grow the cattle and the men who want to feed them in the winter will mean a fair division of profit. This system will be more permanent. Many farmers will, not take in many calves under the old system because they are afraid the market will break as it did last winter. And, so, we believe that this organization has a very good future. Now, I have talked, I think, about three or four minutes longer than I was slated to, so I think I'd better not worry you any longer. </seg>
            <seg id="p672">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF ACRICULTURE I know that you have a great many problems. No business has so many problems as agriculture — the buying and selling of products, the watching of the market from the buyer's standpoint and from the seller's standpoint keeps the farmer on the alert all the time. But, after all, it appeals to men as the finest life in the world and offers many opportunities to get as much out of life as a man and a woman can get. That seems to be the thing the farmer wants most. I thank you. MR. HILDEBRAND: I am just wondering whether each and every man here got the full significance of that proposition of cooperation. Mr. Marshall, would you mind briefly going over that again? MR. MARSHALL: The cattle were raised in Canada. They were sold in the spring at an average of 12c a pound. They were supposed to be weighed into the feed lots at 400 pounds. The weights were recorded as the calves were weighed. Now each man who got th* cattle to feed put up a dollar per head for insurance in case they should die. If he bought them and any of them died, he would lose them. I think last winter out of 200 head there were only three that died. The result — most of this money was paid back. The feeder takes these cattle at 400 pounds. He feeds during the winter under supervision. The cattle were sold last spring at 12c a pound. They gained 250 pounds. The farmer got for feeding them l%c on the 400 pounds that they weighed in. He got the full value of the 250 pounds at 12c per pound. That would be $30.00, so he got $36.00 for feeding. The rancher got the weight of 400 pounds at 12c less the l&amp;c per pound, which was 10%c. The cattle were shipped when the market was at the top. Those which were -ready to go early were sent then. I think the work under supervision taught these men more than they could learn anywhere in two to three years — just having a man come to the feed lot and tell them what was wrong. The thing was a liberal education in that way and the farmers and ranchers are very enthusiastic for it at the present time. MR'. HILDEBRAND: I want to say to Mr. Marshall that we have very much appreciated this talk he has given us today and I think we should give him a rising vote of thanks. Now, gentlemen, it will take only a few moments to complete our program. The next speaker is Mr. Modissett, who is one of the very successful ranchers of Nebraska. He was just made a Master Farmer Tuesday night. You know this is an entirely new thing that Mr. Marshall has brought us and I just want to call on Mr. Modissett and get his reaction. Mr. Modissett. MR. MODISSETT: This struck me very favorably. Something like that would help the business, I am sure. We always have the producers to blame for trying to bite the feeder. It is hard to get </seg>
            <seg id="p673">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION together. With this system there wouldn't be any campaign put on. The fact that a man goes around and supervises this feeding is a big factor in its favor. MR. HILDEBRAND: Gentlemen, 1 think Mr. McDill has an an - nouncement to make at this time. MR. McDILL: Mr. Hildebrand has a short talk as president or the Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders Association and imme - diately following we will have a luncheon. Now this luncheon takes the place of the annual banquet of this association. All life members and all visiting ranchmen and feeders and farmers are welcome to this box luncheon to be served here. Immediately following this luncheon, and we will eat here, there will be a short business meeting of the Improved Livestock Breeders Association chiefly for the purpose of electing officers for the ensuing year. Mr. Hildebrand will now present his annual address as president. PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS 1 DAN HILDEBRAND We want you to all stay here. You are all welcome to eat with us, and we want each and every man here interested in livestock to remain over the noon hour. Gentlemen, I want to report the meeting of the National Livestock and Meat Board. You will recall that a year ago you passed a resolu - tion here endorsing the collection of 25c per car. for all livestock shipped to the open market for the promotion of livestock. Mr. Mar - shall has given us the most wonderful talk I have ever heard. If you could have been at this meeting in Chicago in December where all interests were brought together — the retailer, the sheep man, the hog man, the cattle producer, the packer — in fact, everyone interested in livestock — to promote the interests of livestock. We had to discuss the collection of this 25c until we had all interests agreed to this. I was in Omaha last week trying to persuade the Farmers Union execu - tive.board to cooperate with us in the collection of this 25c per car. I am happy to report to you that there are approximately fifty live - stock organizations throughout the country that have agreed to this progressive work of ours. There 1b only one organization that has not agreed — that is the Farmers Union group. I am certainly hoping that we will have their favorable reply. Certainly we need this co - operation. We need this 25c collection to aid us in advertising our product. If we could satisfy the demands for these people who go out and put on demonstrations. One university has a woman who cooks meats </seg>

We have just cracked the ground with reference to what we must do in order to pull what we have and gain back something that we have lost in beef consumption. To me this talk of Mr. Mar - shall's was very inspiring — very encouraging. It only means that 1 am going to try to say that, we should have this added money in our business. I am sure that you men will profit by your support of the National Livestock and Meat Board in this 25c per car we are trying to collect. To my mind, men, you have been treated to a wonderful lot or good talks this week. I think we are indebted to those responsible for bringing these men together to give you these talks. Now, take this cooperative feeding proposition. You know we have known for a long time that we couldn't go on feeding cattle as we have in the past. You know the road we have had to travel since 1930. Many men are not able to come back this year. We have certainly got to pay more attention to experiments that are brought to us by these agricultural colleges in the operation of our business more in the future if we expect to continue to promote agriculture and the live - stock business. I am sure you men will go home feeling that you have been well repaid for the time you have spent here. But, after all, men, you are going to have to solve your own problems. The Farm Board may help you, but the Lord will help you more if you help yourselves. Apparently when we try to help one phase it usually costs the other phase. We have been feeding what. What has happened? When we started corn and wheat were the same price. Apparently the man who had corn to sell began to holler because corn was going down below wheat. We are not inter - ested in this part of Nebraska in the sugar beet proposition. They have removed all prejudice against ground beet. I do not believe there is a less opportune time for this to have been released, because this month is the time the ranchers make their contracts with their beet sugar companies. In trying to help the corn man apparently it goes right back to the beet man. You can appreciate that when you take money out of one man's pocket you have to put it back in some other pocket. We have problems to solve. There are men here who can follow this creep feeding proposition and make a success of it. There is no question in my mind, men, but what if conditions continue as they have in the past few years there will be very few of us who will not be creep feeding. Certainly there has been no profit in long grain feeding. I certainly hope that there will be something come out of this meeting in which there will be closer cooperation between the rancher and the eastern feeder, and certainly we need more coopera- </seg>

We must solve our own problems. - I am not going to take any more of your time. I appreciate your attendance here because it only lends enthusiasm for the men here to go on and do their work. A. R. MODISSETT: The annual meeting of the American National Livestock Association will be held in Los Angeles in January. The railroads are making special rates to all those who care to attend. This organization is a clearance for all stock organizations. It is well worth anyone's time to attend. MR. HILDEBRAND: Probably you have noticed in the papers .of the modification of the Packers' Consent Decree. I happen to have been in Washington When this was in effect. Apparently the packer makes mistakes too. I am inclined to think that this Is going to go through because it will permit the packer to come in competition with the things that have come to pass in the past ten years. Possibly it will interest you to know that only four packers were affected by this decree. - There is one Iowa plant that packs more hogs than any one packer in Chicago. Certainly it was unfair.

M. Seventy-five live - stock breeders and feeders attended this meeting. The minutes of the 1930 annual meeting .were read and approved. The election of oflicers was the first matter of business taken up. The President called for nominations for president. Mr. Graff moved that Mr. Dan Hildebrand be unanimously re-elected. The motion was seconded by Mr. Magdanz. The motion carried and Mr. Hildebrand was duly re-elected. Mr. Hildebrand explained that the organization had been without a secretary since last June when Mr. O. O. Waggeher left his position as Extension Specialist in Animal Husbandry to take up new duties with the Burlington railroad. Mr. W. W. Derrick was nominated for secretary by K. C. Fouts of Seward. The nomination was changed to a motion and seconded by Chas. Graff. The motion carried unanimously and Mr. Derrick was elected secretary of the organization. The President called for nominations for treasurer. The treasurer's report was called for and was read by Acting Secretary McDill as follows: Appropriation July 1 , 19 30 _. $ 1 ,500.00 Expenditures Compensation to Nellie Frasier : _ 68.25 4 -H premiums . _ 24.65 Breed specials at State Fair 100.00 W.

Moved by Professor Gramlich that a committee be appointed to study the advisability of continuing the judging contest feature. Motion was seconded and carried. Mr. McDill explained why the contest was dropped from the 1931 program: 1. Because the program was filled to the point where there was too little time for a judging contest. 2. It had developed into a game of chance for the Agricultural College students. They bought an annual membership and entered the contest hoping to beat enough farmers in the art of stock judging so that the cash prizes they won would more than return the dollar they spent for membership. Mr. Hldebrand appointed the following committee for study of the judging contest feature: H. J. McLaughlin, Prof. H. J. Gramlich R. C. Johnson. Several expressed a desire for shorter programs. The idea of having one real headline speaker was advanced by several members. The idea of the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders Associa - tion helping to buy a meat cooler for the new 4-H Club building j being constructed at the State Fair grounds was presented by Mr. McDill. The matter was discussed by Mr. Hildebrand, Mr. Buel, and others. All favored the idea of helping to make possible a meat and carcass exhibit at the State Fair. Mr. Buel moved that the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders Association should put as much money as would be available this spring after necessary expenses were paid into a suitable cooler for the 4-H Club building. The motfon was seconded by K. C. Fouts. The motion was voted on and carried. Mr. McDill presented the matter of President Hildebrand's ex - penses in attending the Nebraska Stockgrowers convention at Chadron June 1, 1930. Acting Secretary McDill acting as chairman, asked for a motion ' concerning Mr. Hildebrand's expenses. Moved by Chaa.

THE PLACE OP LIVESTOCK ON THE FARM OF TOMORROW H. J. GRAMLICH The subject assigned me is one which tempts a man to be a prophet. A prophet is usually wrong in his forecasts and, accordingly, his lot is not to be desired. Some folks have been so cruel as to say that prophets are liars. A liar has been denned as a man who has no division in his brain between truth and fiction. Whether or not - this is true, it must be admitted that he who attempts to talk about the future is' essentially a guesser. The livestock business has always been an important part of the world's agricultural activity. It probably will continue to be such. - It is fascinating because there is a certain uncertainty about it. Back in Biblical times Noah established a reputation. He was conceded to be the world's greatest and most successful livestock man because he held on to his flocks and herds when the rest of the world was in liquidation. At times during recent months some livestock men would have welcomed a flood of such proportions as to entirely remove their charges from them. The plight of the sheep man last spring whose lots were filled with fat lambs possessing a market value of 9c per pound and an initial cost of 13c is representative of one of our most distressing examples. During mid-summer both thin and fat cattle sold at exceedingly low prices 'and unquestionably there were many fortunes dissipated in the span of a few weeks' time. During such intervals we sometimes feel that the livestock business is like the penitentiary and the banking business, in that it looks better from the outside than from within. In spite of the mediocre aspect of the present and immediate past, there can be no denying that livestock must continue to con - stitute an important part of the farm operations. While not abso - lutely necessary in the production of large crops, they are essential in the consumption of them. State Statistician A. E. Anderson has recently released some statistics which show that the farmers of Ne - braska are receiving 70&lt;#&gt; of their caBh income through the sales of </seg>
            <seg id="p680">REPOIIT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE livestock products. A great deal of the other 'M'/c comes from tin 1 «ilc of grains and roughages which are to be fed ultimately to live - stock. A few years ago it seemed that we might reach a time when there would be a shortage of food for humans and it would be neces - sary to curtail the fattening of farm animals in order that more of the cereals be used in the preparation of human foods and only the coarser by-products be available for livestock feeding. Quite a group' of persons felt that this might be true in the near future. As the matter stands today, we find a rather drastic trend the other way We have a tremendous over-production of grains. If the corn, wheat, oats, and barley produced in the world in 1930 were to be used exclusively for human consumption, there would be an ample supply to carry through a five-year period, even though the tillers of the soil were not to seed an acre during that time. Animals produce concentrated products. The average fattening domestic animal utilizes from five to ten pounds of grain and hay in producing one pound of increased body weight. This is an un - economical procedure but, seemingly, one which is essential in order to keep the proper balance between supply and demand of food pro - ducts. The human race needs meat in the diet— not too much, to be sure, but a well-balanced ration produces people of the stamp and stamina to carry on this world"s activities upon a high plane. Races which have tried to subsist entirely upon vegetarian diets have been dwarfed both physically and mentally to a point where they play but a minor part in supplying the creative genius of the universe. Instead of finding fault with farm animals, we should be thankful that they are available to help carry out our agricultural scheme. There is a possibility that in the future animals will not be finished as highly as in the past. In fact, there is a rather marked trend in demands toward meat produced by such animals. A customer went to the meat shop in a town of 5,000 recently and asked for a good T-bone steak. The butcher was unable to show him one but did expose the loin of a medium animal and offer to cut a steak from it. The customer interrogated, "Is that the best meat you can buy?" The retailer replied, "No, but it is the best I can sell." Unquestionably this is typical of a condition existent in many towns throughout the United States. If this becomes a general condition, it is possible that beef making will be hinged pretty closely around the liberal use of farm roughages and the limited use of grains. Should this be the case, there is no question but what the corn plant will be one of the first to be drawn into the picture. Year after year we have permitted thousands of tons of good forage to be wasted through exposure to the elements. The corn plant can be preserved either through the silo or in the form of fodder and made to furnish a tremendous amount of feed for livestock. Nebraska folks have been prone to scoff at silos even though their merits have been extolled throughout the past </seg>
            <seg id="p681">NI211UASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK UREEDZRS' ASSOCIATION quarter of a century. The advent of the simple. Inexpensive, yet highly efficient trench silo is going to do more toward popularizing silage than any one other agency. There is seldom a year but what at least one field of corn on the average farm is disappointing. This has very little value unless cut and preserved. By turning gopher for a few days one can very -easily build a trench silo of sufficient capacity to house feed for the livestock of the farm. In many instances having such feed will enable one to purchase additional animals. Not infrequently cattle can be carried through the winter on such ration and sold the following spring as feeders or as stockers to those who have grass to run stock upon. I firmly believe that the future holds much in store for the man who can adapt his farming operations to include this as one of the features. Our agronomy friends have always advocated crop rotations. The liberal use of rotations Involves the production of considerable rough - age of both a leguminous and non-leguminous nature. To get value from this, livestock must be available. Domestic animals offer a medium of exchange to the farmers of today and tomorrow. They serve practically the same function as that served by the beads of the red man. The bulky, non-merchantable roughages, as well as a large percentage of the grains produced by and the property of the farmer, must be processed through the farm animal which, in turn, is -sold for the cash which eventually pays the taxes and buys new shoes for the baby. It would be folly for me to go into detail on this subject. If I were to do so, it would be largely based upon occurrences of the past. A wag has ventured the statement that what you learn one year makes a fool out of you the next. I guess we must admit that there is considerable truth to this. With the advent during recent years of a tremendous volume of free advice to the tiller of the soil, we have heard that it is necessary for the farmer to be both intelligent and smart. He must be intelligent enough to absorb the advice offered by his city cousins and smart enough to use only that which will do him the least harm. I do feel safe in making the prediction that livestock will play fully as important a part on the farm of tomorrow as on the farm of yesterday. The man "who succeeds in producing his animals most economically and In fattening them with the least expense is the one who will be able to survive the lean years which are bound to develop on the horizon at more or less frequent intervals. </seg>

            <seg id="p686">Annual Convention of Nebraska Potato Improvement Association 1930 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN TYPE OP NEBRASKA CERTIFIED SEED POTATOES MARX KOEHNKE Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative A survey of the historical aspects of the improvement of Triumph seed potatoes m Nebraska will be of importance at this time. This is made with ' the understanding that many of the growers present are already quite familiar with these matters, for your speaker did not become connected with certification work m an active manner until the year 1923. Beginning with the seasons 1918 and 1919, potato improvement work had its inception m western Nebraska m the activities of the Horticultural Department of the College of Agriculture. This depart - ment of the University of Nebraska, m conjunction with the Depart - ment of Horticulture of the University of Louisiana, instituted tests m Louisiana to determine the reasons for the extremely poor results secured from the plantings of northern grown seed potatoes m the South. The production of early potatoes m southern states, partic - ularly Louisiana, was for several years on the decrease, so much so that the section would have been out of production m a few years. The tests showed conclusively that the reason for the poor yields was largely a matter of disease In the seed used. With this as a basis, it was decided that a program of seed potato improvement should be instituted m Nebraska. The first improvement work carried on by the Horticultural De - partment was by means of an organization known as the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association.. The membership of this organiza - tion was recruited m the technical departments of the university, and among the active potato growers m the state. This primary improve - ment work was largely a matter of selection of outstanding seed strains being grown at that time. A few of. the strains of potatoes selected for foundation stock at that time found wide use and were widely disseminated, not only m western Nebraska, but to other northern states also. In fact, the foundation strains selected at that time have found their way into some of the tuber index strains that are In use at the present time, of which I will speak later. </seg>
            <seg id="p687">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION For a few years these foundation strains were the principal means of improvement of the average potato strains. The next improvement of foundation stock came from the activities of the growers them - selves, In the planting of seed plats each year, for their own seed stock. This method was used to keep up the quality of the original seed strains that had been disseminated. Though this method was not very effective for the improvement of the strains, It did succeed in keeping the strains from deteriorating rapidly. In all fairness it must be stated at this time, that some growers were able to affect improvement with their seed plat work. Others, of course, had the opposite results. The general means of improvement of strains was the elimination of disease plants, in other words, the rogueing of disease. This means was at the command of all the growers, and was used with varying degrees of success, depending on the thoroughness with which each grower performed this operation. In some cases, the climate and other outside factors had a bearing on this, also. At the same time that improvement of the seed was being accom - plished, with varying degrees of success, methods of checking the results were being devised. The principal method employed to check the improvement of seed strains was the planting of test plats. These test plats included sample's of all lots entered for certification, and were planted in Nebraska, and in Louisiana. By this means, all lots were compared on an equal basis, and the poorer lots were eliminated. Some outstanding lots were located in this manner, and these were recommended to the growers for their foundation plantings. This same method of checking lots of potatoes for disease, by comparison in adjacent rows, is still used with very good results. At the present time, the test plats in the South are located in the states of Florida and Mississippi. With the development of technique in the detection of disease, and experience in the production of certified potatoes, the methods were changed and improved. These methods that were developed have been accepted, as standards by many states, and now represent the best known means of producing high class foundation seed stock. Credit must be extended at this time to the outstanding work of Pro - fessor H. O. Werner of the Horticultural Department, and Dr. R. W. Goss, of the Plant Pathology Department of the University of Nebraska. To these two men, more than any others connected with the certifica - tion of potatoes in Nebraska, goes most credit for the high rank of Nebraska certified potatoes. The Agricultural College of the University of Nebraska during the year 1924 was relieved of the active work of certification in the field, and began a campaign of foundation Reed potato improvement. In these activities the departments of Horticulture and Plant Pathol - ogy cooperated in evolving methods and improvising means of pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p688">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE. BOARD OF AGRICULTURE uinuig this high grade foundation stock. Many details of this work are not of interest to the growers, but the essentials will be described. In the first place, samples were selected from the most promising of fields then under certification in this state. Samples of the outstanding strains that had been developed in other states were also secured. In this work, Montana, Wisconsin, and Maine furnished valuable as - sistance. These samples were shipped to Lincoln, and the work inaugurated in the university greenhouses. This work, which has since become designated by the term "tuber - indexing," consists in general of removing a seed piece from a tuber at the same time giving both the tuber ;Ind the piece removed an identifying number. The seed pieces are then planted in separate flower pots, each being marked with a corresponding number. The pots are then placed under favorable condition's of moisture and tem - perature. As soon as the potato plants grow to a stage where it is possible to detect disease, all the plants are carefully checked for any manifestations of disease. The diseases that are to be eliminated are forms of mosaic and spindle tuber. To bring out the mosaic disease symptoms the plants are placed under conditions warmer than normal for a few days, and again checked. Then to enable checking spindle tuber disease carefully, the temperature Is lowered below normal for some time. This, in general, describes the procedure that is followed in "tuber-indexing" of potatoes. The original stocks that were developed by this means are not all being planted at the present time. The success of this early work may be attested to by any grower, or those familiar with the certifica - tion of potatoes in Nebraska. However, it must be stated at this time that there were objections to the first work of this kind. Along with the elimination of disease, there was an elimination of some strains that were very desirable from the standpoint of yielding ability. Some of the growers were reluctant to accept these new strains offered them, and sacrifice the high-yielding ability of their old stock. Some of these were among the most outstanding of growers, and in fairness to them, it must be said that there was a basis for their claims. The original potatoes that were selected for indexing lacked uniformity in the date of maturity. Some of the plants produced from the tubers were extremely early in their maturity, and other plants were extremely late. The majority of the plants were of a medium maturity, in most lots. Here, then, was a new problem, that of selecting, or de - veloping a foundation lot that was uniform in date of maturity, and at the same time without the objection of being low-yielding. After the development of the technique of tuber indexing for disease elim - ination, it became necessary to develop a means of eliminating the undesirable types of plants, from the standpoint of maturity. This was a problem that could not be solved in the greenhouse work, and had to be worked out in the field. </seg>
            <seg id="p689">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Tuber indexing was conducted entirely in greenhouses during the winter time. When undesirable plants were detected, the tuber from which it was secured was then discarded. The next step was to grow the remaining part of the good tubers in the field to increase the progeny for commercial use. This is the point that developed the method of tuber uniting, a plan of planting to keep all the seed pieces from one tuber separate in the field. Briefly described, it consists of planting the seed pieces from one tuber in adjacent positions in a row-, and then marking the break between progeny of each tuber by means of a skip in the row, or by a stake. It was under these field conditions that an attempt was first made to eliminate the variations in maturity. The plants that matured very early, or very late, as the case might be, were marked by means of stakes. In harvesting, these plants that were marked, were kept separate by hand digging, and classified as to the approximate time of maturity. The tubers were again taken to the greenhouses and indexed for disease. During the following year, the product of various hills of similar maturing date, were planted in adjacent rows. During the growing season these hill units, that is, the product of a hill the previous year, were checked and compared with the adjoining units for comparative uniformity. It was found that some of the previous units were wrongly classified, and had to be rechecked the following year. Evidently there were other reasons for early and late maturing than were inherent in the potatoes themselves. This caused confusion, and in some cases set back the work of developing a uniformity of strain. The weather was a factor to be considered, and early frosts caused serious set-backs, in preventing the accurate classification of strains. This made the work of improvement difficult, and put a higher value of the results that were secured. Considering the difficulties that had to be sur - mounted, the work progressed at a rapid rate, and the results are such as to give great satisfaction to all concerned. Growers now have at their disposal strains of potatoes that mature early, medium, and late, according to their particular needs, or desires. Here it is time to take cognizance of the manner in which the results were to be used to benefit the grower in western Nebraska, and in the southern states. Growers who chose to produce foundation stock for the use of commercial growers, viewed the results with considerable satisfaction. They benefited in two ways. They were ' able to grow larger acreages, and to do it more cheaply. According to the records of the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers, this has greatly increased the average acreage per grower. The most significant result has been the reduction of labor necessary to handle the rogueing of commercial fields. At the same time it has raised the standards of certification to a point that was unthought of a few years ago. A definite result from the standpoint of quality has been the elimina - . tion of disease in the general fields. Indexed lots now under produc- </seg>
            <seg id="p690">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion in Nebraska on an average have a disease content of all diseases below 1 per cent. This data was secured by referring to the records of inspections in the office of the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers for the year 1930. At the same time, in a chefk of the fields grown from seed that were not indexed, a very vivid comparison was made. The latter unindexed lots had an average total disease content that was slightly below the total disease that is permitted in Nebraska certified potatoes at the present time. Prom that standpoint, alone, the value of this improvement program is clearly seen. The average grower realizes the value of securing high quality strains of potatoes for foundation use, and does not need to be encour - aged to secure them. Many of the growers, however, are not securing the full benefit of this valuable work, and it is to them that this appeal is addressed. From their standpoint a reduction of the cost of production is the main consideration. They must investigate every means of accomplishing this end. For the general dry-land grower, who produces his crop for seed purposes in the South, the medium - maturing strains are most advisable. These strains combine the fea - tures of low . disease content, and high-yielding ability. No grower can afford to raise potatoes for certification using the old strains of seed. The experiment station at Alliance can now provide every grower with sufficient seed to plant a seed plat which will furnish seed to plant a large commercial acreage the coming season. Growers producing potatoes under Irrigation have available strains that are best adapted to their use. There are early strains of seed stock suitable for the grower who wishes to put his crop on the early table market. For the grower that Is interested in producing late crop potatoes, with high tonnage the most important consideration, the later maturing strains are recommended. Features of disease freedom and high yielding ability are combined in these strains. With this brief consideration it may easily be seen that the -value of the new strains of potatoes is almost unlimited. From the general standpoint of potato improvement, the production of uniform maturing strains is the greatest result secured. Our com - petitors producing certified Triumph seed potatoes, Montana and North Dakota, for some time have had the advantage of somewhat earlier strains of potatoes. This is not due to the advantages of the region in which the potatoes are grown, but largely to the seed strains that were selected for use as foundation stock. It proved to be a happy choice for some time, though that advantage is now being removed. Nebraska growers now have strains of potatoes available that will compete with the product of any region producing Triumph potatoes. Various southern sections growing early potatoes on a large commercial scale, are experimenting to find the strains that are best adapted to their needs. We hope to be able to furnish the exact strain that is adapted to their particular use in the next few years. It Is not beyond </seg>
            <seg id="p691">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION the possibility of imagination, that in a few years a southern buyer will specify "early," "medium," and "late" strains, when placing an order. In summarizing these remarks, let me impress upon the mind of each potato grower in western Nebraska, the need for being wide awake to all of the possibilities of improving their own methods or potato production. This talk has taken into consideration only the improvements of foundation seed stock. Though the urgent need for high quality seed is usually granted, it is not the only factor to con - sider. There are constantly being developed new methods to perform old operations. Every phase of potato production is constantly being improved. Time, which is money in one sense, effort and money; are being conserved by the wide awake farmers. They are the leaders, and others must fall in line or be eliminated from the race. In the final analysis, every grower must apply the rule "will it pay" to every new idea that comes to him. This means applying the principles of big business to the lowly business of farming, and is the real basis of farm relief that will succeed. OBSERVATIONS ON FIVE TRIPS INTO THE SOUTHERN POTATO PRODUCING SECTIONS WM. MORROW Manager, Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative It has been my duty each spring for the past several years to make trips into the Southern territories in which we sell seed, to determine how our seed was performing, problems of the potato grower there and to establish new connections. Triumph potatoes are grown in a good many territories in the South as a commercial proposition. Harvest starts first in April in Florida and south Texas, a little later in Louisiana, then Alabama, Oklahoma and . . Arkansas. Very few Triumphs are grown east of the Mississippi River, although W^F^^^fek there is a small section around Savannah, '.^£. ~V$k Georgia, that is using ten to twenty cars ttjj S^^ of Nebraska Certified Triumphs each year.

            <seg id="p692">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In some territories, methods used would seem quite primitive to the Nebraska potato grower. Farm implements are of the type that can be hauled by one mule. Planting is done by hand, and at Savan - nah, Georgia, even harvest is a hand proposition. The small "middle - buster" digger is much more in evidence than the standard elevator digger used here. The Rio Grande valley of Texas and south Alabama are more nearly comparable to Nebraska on production methods than the other territories visited. Fields are larger. Tractors are used to work the land and to pull modern two-row elevator diggers. The valley is just beginning to use commercial fertilizer. Seed is planted at the rate or from twenty, to thirty bushels per acre. Southern Alabama is a heavy consumer of commercial fertilizer and is gradually increasing the amount of seed used per acre. Southern Louisiana has proven to be a very good potato section. Weather conditions vary, of course, but the progressive growers in that section usually manage to harvest a good crop. They rotate their land to legumes, use plenty of commercial fertilizer, good seed and practice very intensive cultural methods. Fields are usually small, five to eight acres, planting usually by hand and harvested with a small digger. There will always be a place for high class seed potatoes in the South. Potatoes are considered an early spring or late winter crop. They are harvested just before the extremely hot weather sets in.

It would be an expensive if not impossible task to produce disease free seed from this early spring crop. Some sections follow the policy of planting back their little potatoes after harvest in the spring. These lay in the ground until midsummer or fall when they germinate and produce a crop that makes fairly satisfactory seed for the next spring crop. Production of this second or junior crop is very much a weather proposition. The use of first crop potatoes for seed would involve cold storage through the hot winter months. Considering the cost and hazard of possible seed pro - duction in the South and the cost of storage, the Nebraska grower can well afford to compete against the southern grower who might attempt to produce his own seed. Good seed is a pre-requislte of a good yield per acre, and we can readily see that the southern grower must secure a go"od yield if he stays in the business. High cost of fertilizer and seed, regardless of whether the seed is imported or produced at home, mean a high cost per acre which must be compensated with good yields. We must con - tinue our efforts to produce the highest quality seed available. It is u. necessity to the southern planter. HOW POTATOES GROW By DR. F. A. KRANTZ University of Minnesota, Agricultural Experiment Station, St. Paul, Minnesota The original home of the potato, Solatium tuberosum, is in the tropics of South America. It is native to the Andean region, where it is grown in the higher altitudes under uniformly cool conditions. The year is divided into a cool and a dry H season. The tubers of the potato plant are an adaptation on the part of the plant to enable it to persist throughout the dry season. The present cultivated varieties were apparently adapted from stock en - demic to a Host free habitat as they show no resistance to frost. The potato is there - fore unusual in the fact that it makes its best growth under rather cool conditions, but at. the same time is very sensitive to light frosts. At the present time the potato is grown under a varied range of climatic condi - tions. By taking advantage of the most DR F A krantz favorable season of the year, it is grown </seg>
            <seg id="p694">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE from within the Arctic Circle to semi-tropical regions. Consequently we find it grown in the summer in the North and in the winter in the South and in the fall and spring in the intermediate regions. The rela - tively short season which the potato requires to produce a crop enables the crop to be grown during the more favorable seasons in any given region. The potato is grown by use of the tubers, either cut into pieces or planted whole, and the plant draws upon the reserve food supply in the tubers until the sprouts appear above ground and develop its branches and leaves. After the foliage leaves appear, the plant begins to manufacture its own food by taking water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air and combining these in the leaves with the aid of sunlight. The plant foods that it manufactures are sugars, starches, and other similar compounds which are given the general name of carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are then combined by the plant with other mineral elements which the plant obtains from the soil, such as nitrogen, potash, phosphate, to form proteins and other more complex organic compounds. In the early stages of the growth of the plant, all the food that is manufactured is used up in producing vine growth. During thiB period in the life of the plant the vine growth is very rapid. When the foliage leaves become so numerous that more carbohydrates are manufactured than is necessary for the growth of the plant, a reserve of carbohydrates accumulates. This reserve is transported down through the stalk to underground stems which enlarge and tubers begin to develop. The tuber development 1b very slow at first because of the very small amount of carbohydrates that remain after the needs of the plant are supplied, but as the grand period of growth slackens the accumulation becomes greater and greater, with a consequent increasing rapidity of tuber development. The development of the tubers continues until there is no more green foliage remaining on the vine and the vine has completely died. Under normal conditions before the vine dies all the carbohydrates that are in soluble form are trans - ferred to the tubers. Fertility. A very fertile soil usually has a plentiful supply of nitrate and moisture. These tend to promote vine growth, with the subsequent production of very large vines. Rapid vine growth usually means that the carbohydrates will be utilized completely for vine - growth for a longer period of time than would otherwise have been the case. Consequently, under such conditions, tuber setting is quite frequently delayed. Also, if the weather during the early stage of growth has been unfavorable, such as lack of moisture, a favorable season later will quite frequently delay the maturity of the vine. Out - side of the probable delay in tuber development and in the maturity of the vine very little detriment is experienced by excessive amount of fertility and moisture in the soil. If the season Is long enough </seg>
            <seg id="p695">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION so that the plants mature normally, 3 large crop can be exfr&gt;».«».. Under low fertility conditions, if other conditions are favorable, a relatively large crop of tubers in proportion to the amount of vine growth can be expected. The difficulty here is that the vine growth is too small to produce a large crop, even if the production of tubers is fairly large for the size of the vine. Effect of Temperature. I have previously mentioned that the best development of the potato takes place at rather low temperatures, or in other words, during a relatively cool season. Under high tem - peratures, or relatively warm weather, there is an increase in the rate of the manufacture of carbohydrates, but this is more than offset in an increase in the rate of respiration, causing the breakdown or decomposition of the products manufactured. As high temperature increases, the breakdown is more rapid than the manufacture of the carbohydrates. Under very high temperatures all the carbohydrates manufactured may be lost, with a resultant poor growth of vines and practically no tuber development. Under exceedingly high tempera - tures, the vine itself may die due to loss of food materials. The cooler the growing season, the less carbohydrates are lost. Consequently this type of a season usually produces a large crop. Effect of Variable Conditions. In the cornbelt temperatures may become so extreme that, insofar as the potato crop is concerned, it overshadows all other factors. In Ohio, Dr. J. \V. Bushnell found that temperature was a limiting factor in the production of a large crop of potatoes. In the more northern states, or in regions of high altitude, temperature becomes less of an important factor and fre - quently even may be of minor importance compared to other factors, such as moisture, and in certain regions where the temperature and moisture is favorable, fertility of the soil may be the sole limiting factor. The relation of soil fertility to the amount of the crop is so well known that I shall not dwell upon it any further. Moisture plays a very Important part in plant growth. A plentiful supply of moisture facilitates the movement of raw materials from the soil to the base of the plant. It also facilitates the movement of the manu - factured food from the leaves down the stems of the tubers for storage. A variable supply of moisture in the soil may quickly promote or retard growth. Alternately dry and wet weather throughout the growing season results in abnormal vine and tuber growth. The effect upon the vine is usually not important. Consequently it is not fre - quently observed. However, the effect upon the tubers, causing ab - normal growth and other changes which affect the market value of the crop is very important and consequently these abnormalities are well known to every grower. The influence on the crop of changes in the moisture conditions of the soil is quite frequently determined by the stage of growth which the plant is in. If the growing conditions are uniform during the period of growth when the tubers are develop- </seg>
            <seg id="p696">UEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE liOAKD OV ACIUCULTUR^ ... 6 , a. good marketable crop is usually secured. In other words, changes in moisture content of the soil from dry to extremely moist during the early stages of growth of the plant usually affect the market value of the later crop very little, providing conditions are uniform during the time the crop is being developed. A similar con - dition holds true for temperatures. Usually high temperatures are more or less serious on the crop if they occur before tuber develop - ment starts. If they occur after this period, they may have a very critical influence on the crop. Potato growers have recognized the desirability of having -uniform growth conditions for the crop. In a great many regions the growers have found out by long experience the proper time to plant the crop so that the period of tuber development will occur under the best growing conditions for the potato in that region. Also cultural meth - ods that will conserve moisture during relatively dry periods are bene - ficial to the crop. Certain varieties have also been found to be less influenced by changes in growing conditions throughout the season. Usually an early or quick maturing variety can be better fitted into most favorable growing period. Also these varieties, by taking up a smaller portion of the season, have just that much less chance of running into variable weather conditions. Certain varieties are less sensitive to growing conditions than other varieties. The Early Ohio is an example of a variety which is very much affected by adverse growing conditions. In fact this variety appears to be rapidly going out of commercial production on account of its tendency to form knobs and growth cracks when conditions are at all unfavorable. The Burbank and the Russet Burbank are also examples of varieties which can be grown only under very limited conditions on account of their Hcnsitiveness to unfavorable growing conditions. The Green Mountain If another variety whose range of adaptability seems to be very limited. The Bliss Triumph is an example of a variety whose tubers retain a good market type over a wider range of conditions than the Green Mountain, Early Ohio, or Burbank, but whose vine seems to be rather sensitive to high temperatures. The' Irish Cobbler and the Rural New Yorker can be grown under a wide range of growing conditions and aro found more widely distributed than any of the other varieties previously mentioned. They appear to have a .wider range of adapta - tion than any of the other varieties. </seg>

We have had the pleasure of having Mr. Werner at our meetings on several occasions. We feel he has played a large part in the accomplishments of the Kansas potato growers In the past ten ■ ...ai^^M-i,- years.

Werner was kind enough to take me on a trip this morning to see your 1^^^^^^"^^^^^^^*] splendid potato section and to interview FRANK blecha several of the leading growers. I at once perceived that there was a great many things being done by the potato growers of Nebraska that would be of great benefit to the growers of Kansas. A great deal of the progress that is made in any line of endeavor' is made possible because of con - tacts between successful men engaged in the same industry. 1 am sure that I will be able to report to the Kansas growers many helpful suggestions which are being practiced by you in Nebraska. I am not quite sure that all of the things that 1 intend to say will be applicable to your conditions here. I did not realize before coming that there could be so much difference between two potato producing sections as there is between your section and that of Kansas. Your territory is suited to the production of seed. Our section is a commercial producing section entirely. We produce the Irish Cobbler potato. You produce the Bliss Triumph. We dig our potatoes in the heat of summer, namely: July and August. You harvest your crop in the late fall. Today you have discussed problems that we, in Kansas, have never experienced. For instance, a great deal of dis - cussion this morning was concerning the sun cracking of potatoes on </seg>
            <seg id="p698">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AORICU1-TURK lining brought to the surface of the ground when digging. This indeed would be a very strange problem to the growers of Kansas and from your discussions I can readily see that this is an important problem in Nebraska. I was asked to discuss the progress the Kansas potato growers have made during the past ten years, laying particular em - phasis on their marketing accomplishments. Even though the two sections are very different, I hope that I may be able to give you a few ideas which will be useful to you here in Nebraska. Ten years ago the potato acreage of Kansas was being gradually reduced due to the ravages of certain potato diseases. Some of the potato growers were losing as high as 50% of their stand due to Rhizoctonia and Blackleg. The Extension Division of the Kansas State Agricultural College co-operating very closely with Prof. L. E. Mel - chers, of the Plant Pathology Department, Outlined a program whereby these diseases might be controlled. It is needless for me to go into detail as to how this, was done in Kansas, as from my conversation with various persons this morning I see that you are already acquainted with the methods of controlling these diseases. Following the adop - tion of the practice of treating the seed potato before planting with corrosive sublimate, or hot formaldehyde, it was brought to the atten - tion of the Kansas growers that only certified seed should be planted, and therefore eliminate other diseases such as spindle tuber. The value of rotation was brought to their attention, and the importance of better cultivation was also stressed. At the end of the live-year period, the reward for solving the above problems was remarkable. The figures of the Kansas State Board of Agriculture show that the yield of potatoes was Increased on an average of 38 bushels per acre. The following table shows by counties producing potatoes the results of the production program: Averace Average Yield of 10-year Period 10-year Period Potatoes, Increase County 1909-1918 1919-1928 per Acre Douglas 88.2 126.3 38.1 Jefferson 86.4 124.6 38.2 Johnson . 85.1 126.5 41.4 Leavenworth 83.9 121.0 37.1 Shawnee 82.8 136.4 43.6 Wyandotte 91.9 126.2 34.3 Average for all Counties 88.0 126.8 38.8 The control of disease was indeed a big factor in Kansas in the production of potatoes. About 1918, soon after getting into the pro - duction phase of the potato program. Director H. Umberger, of the Extension Division, of the Kansas State Agricultural College, perceived that there were other problems In the potato industry than those of production. Accordingly, a 10-year program was drawn, covering all the problems of the potato industry as he saw them'. "There are two main factors," reasoned Dean Umberger, "in* the success of any Industry. Profit is made first by reducing the cost of production per </seg>
            <seg id="p699">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION unit and second by receiving a higher price for their product." Lower - ing the cost of a unit is a production problem and this the growers of the Kaw Valley had accomplished by controlling the potato diseases and by better methods of cultivation. Their yield, therefore, was tremendously increased per unit of land. The second problem in the potato industry was that of marketing, and that entailed the problems of standardizing the product, putting it up in a branded package, and its distribution. The proper distribution of the product means cen - tralized control, and centralized control means a growers marketing association. Accordingly, a 10-year program was drawn covering all the problems concerned in the production and marketing of Kaw Valley potatoes. The production program was started in 1918. . In 1924 we were ready to start on the marketing phase of the program. The first step in the marketing of potatoes is the standardization of the product. . ; «» (f j It will not be amiss at this time perhaps to describe briefly the method by which the Kaw Valley potatoes were harvested and the kind of packs used in loading them, before grading service made its appearance in 1924. The potatoes were dug and gathered in baskets by boys from neighboring towns and cities. Even though the owner would' tell the pickers not to pick small or rotten potatoes, these orders were not always obeyed. The result was that big potatoes, little potatoes, rotten potatoes, and knobby potatoes were put into the same pack. Very often potatoes were dug in our state when the soil was a little damp, the result being that a great amount of soil would stick to the potato. We have official records showing that as much as one and one-half tons of soil was loaded in one 24,000 minimum car lot of potatoes. There were some "short sighted" growers in Kansas who felt that if they could sell to a buyer their soil at the price" potatoes were bring - ing that it was good business for them to do so. Also there were a few who took some pride in putting small and rotten potatoes along with their marketable ones. They felt that the inferior potato that they sold for the price of good was just so much more gain for them. Under these conditions of loading, there was only one thing for the dealers handling Kaw Valley potatoes to do to protect themselves. Personal representatives of the firms were sent to Inspect each carload ' of potatoes that was bought by that particular firm. If the car was found to contain dirt, rotten potatoes, or small potatoes, the price offered was very much lower than the price that could be secured for good marketable potatoes. In other words, the buyer deducted enough so that when the car reached a terminal point there would be plenty of margin to grade the potatoes, take up the loss caused by throwing out the dirt and small and rotten potatoes, an-d still leave a profit for himself. You can rest assured that the margin demanded by the buyer for this kind of product was always large enough. From the </seg>
            <seg id="p700">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Duyer s standpoint they could hardly be blamed, but in this way the better packers of potatoes were often shamefully penalized. Unfortunately, too many cars of these low quality potatoes worked their way into the market without being detected. While the grower gained in each of these particular transactions, yet in the long run it proved to be a great handicap to the Valley as a whole. Let us, for instance, imagine that we are consumers instead of producers. We go to a local grocery and buy 100 pounds of potatoes. In this sack, supposedly containing 100 pounds of good potatoes, we find 10 pounds of dirt, 5 pounds of extremely small potatoes, a few pounds of rotten potatoes, and a few pounds of knobby potatoes. As purchasers of that sort of stock, you can yourself imagine what the results would be. Your local merchant would be told in no uncertain terms just what you thought of that kind of product and you would intimate to him that he was handling an inferior product and selling it at a price of one that is standard. The next time you had occasion to buy potatoes you would undoubtedly order some other brand. The local merchant after receiving a few complaints from, his customers would change to a product sold under a standard brand, and would in no case order the product that caused so much dissatisfaction. This was exactly the thing that happened under the old packing policy in the state of Kansas. Our product fell into disrepute in the trade channels of the United States. Our initial sales were not bring - ing repeat orders, and for a very good and sufficient reason. We were consistently being outsold by sections that were standardizing their product. In 1924, this problem was presented to the growers of Shawnee county by the Extension Division of the Kansas State Agricultural College. They at once saw the Importance of adopting some policy in regards to standardizing their product, and so these men volun - tarily adopted the Federal grading rules. Each of the growers bought a grader, and as the potatoes were picked they were run over the prader and men were stationed by it to remove all the knobby and rotten potatoes. These potatoes, after befng run over the grader, were all of one size with the culls removed. The growers requested the Federal Government to send inspectors to place the grade on every carload that was shipped out of this particular county. The financial reward for doing this was instantaneous and apparent to everyone. A comparison of prices received in Shawnee county with surrounding counties that did not have inspection service was made. The following table gives the results of this comparison: </seg>

It will be noted that Chicago received only 185 carloads of potatoes from the Kaw Valley. It shows that Kansas potatoes were distributed to the point of consumption directly from the various stations in the Kaw Valley and were bring - ing repeat orders. I cannot stress too strongly the necessity of standardization of potatoes, both from a distribution standpoint and from a co-operative marketing standpoint. It soon followed that the potato growers In other counties, after being shown the Shawnee county results, de - manded that their potatoes be inspected. The result of this demand was that the Kansas Legislature passed a compulsory grading law that is effective during the time the commercial potato men are market - ing their product. It has now been in effect for five years, and the benefits of this law are more apparent to the growers of Kansas each year. After the benefits of Inspection service were secured, the last step, that of co-operative marketing, was attempted. There were a great many dealers handling the Kaw Valley potatoes previous to the year 1928. I do not wish to Intimate in the slightest degree that these </seg>
            <seg id="p703">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION men were dishonest. They were working independently of each other and were doing the job to the best ot their ability. There was no centralized control, and therefore each dealer shipped the potatoes wherever he pleased. Many times these several dealers on the same day just happened' to send a great many of their purchased cars to the Chicago market. Other producing sections would do the same. The result inevitably would be that the Ctiicago market was flooded. Studies at the Kansas State Agricultural College point out that the Chicago price of potatoes governs the prices paid for potatoes in other sections of the country. The result of this system of distribu - tion was that the price of potatoes fluctuated in a violent way. Chi - cago might be flooded, but on the other hand Denver, Colorado, or San Antonio, Texas, might be in great need of potatoes. It would be Impossible, however, to get the old price at Denver, or San Antonio, If the Chicago price had been lowered. This condition could only be remedied by having centralized control. Another reason for co-operative marketing was to put into the hands of the producers more bargaining power and centralized control in trie selling end of their operations, which "is extremely desirable with mergers and combinations going on at this time in so many other Industries. Bargaining power and centralized control of course have their limitations that those going into co-operative marketing should fully understand. For instance, it must always be recognized that the law of supply, and demand will govern in the long run, and those who try to artificially break this law will only break themselves. There are, however, a great many factors in bargaining power and centralized control which make it extremely desirable for the pro - ducer to have as great an amount of it as possible. For example, a uniform price can be sent out to the trade for a product of a certain grade and thereby prevent unnecessary competition between growers of the same and different sections. Distribution of the product can be controlled and thereby prevent unnecessary competition between regions. These and other important factors of bargaining power and centralized control could be gone into at great length. . In 1929 co-operative marketing of Kaw Valley potatoes under contract was attempted. This movement Tailed because there was an Insufficient number of signatures to the marketing agreement to make the plan effective. Fortunately for the growers of Kansas, the Federal Farm Board arrived on the scene in the early forepart of 1930. Sev - eral conferences were held with representatives of the Federal Farm Board, and a plan was outlined whereby the growers of the Kaw Valley could get the benefits of co-operative marketing. Ralph Heppe of the Colorado Potato Exchange also gave a great deal of assistance in formulating this plan. </seg>
            <seg id="p704">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lirielly the plan is as follows: The grower signs a continuous marketing agreement. This contract allows the grower to withdraw from the association for the following year by giving notice anytime during the first two weeks in December. The association establishes a daily pool for the various grades of potatoes sold. Each grower producing a given grade will get the average price of that grade for that day. The reasons for this are obvious. Suppose 50 carloads of potatoes of a definite grade are delivered on a certain day. The des - tinations of some of the cars are to far points while others are to extremely close ones. The latter will therefore net more than those poing to a distance and are delivered with much less hazard. In order that there would be no dispute as to the destination of each car, a daily pool was established. The grower according to the contract is to receive approximately 75% of the value of the potatoes when they are loaded on the car. This necessitates a large financing structure which the Federal Farm Board can furnish if necessary. If any further information is desired upon the organization, questions may be asked after my talk and information will be given in greater detail. However, the above points are the most important In the organization plan, and these should be kept clearly in mind. The firm of Williams &amp; Haney was hired by the association to be the selling agents. Fifteen dollars a car was given to them for selling the potatoes. The Kaw Valley Potato Association has just recently closed Its first year's operation. Figure C is a chart showing the remarkable distribution of Kaw Valley potatoes.

            <seg id="p705">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION About 61% of the carlo t tonnage was handled through the Asso - ciation. It can be seen by the chart that the potatoes were not sent to large centers, there to be redistributed, but were sent directly to the points where the potatoes were actually consumed. The Associa - tion was a dominant factor in quoting prices. While the advantages of this cannot be definitely proved, the members of the Association and business men in general realized quite forcibly the advantage they had through the Association. After the season was over, a comparison between association and non-association members was made. Available figures show that Kaw Valley Potato Growers Association of Kansas outsold by approximately 8 cents per 100 pounds the Orrlck, Missouri, potato section. This means about. $ 19.20 per car, containing the minimum of 24,000 pounds of potatoes. Each Kaw Valley grower shipped from 40 to 80 cars. Comparison of Kaw Valley Association prices with the prices of the independent producers in the Kaw Valley shows 5 cents per 100 pounds advantage for the Association. This 5 cents advantage as compared to 8 cents advantage of Orrick potatoes was due to the intense rivalry of the independent dealers in the Kaw Valley in their fight against the association. Kaw Valley potato growers will never get the full benefit of co - operative marketing until other sections organize, and then these dif - ferent organized regions combine Into a national organization. While we in Kansas in the potato industry have organized, and it has been very much worthwhile, yet we feel that the full benefits will not be derived until you men in other producing sections organize with us. The greatest support that the farmer has today in co-operative marketing is the Federal Farm Board. My greatest personal desire is to see that the Federal Farm Board be allowed a fair chance to put over its program, and that you as potato producers will join in this co-operative movement and bring to yourselves the benefits derived therefrom and incidentally allow the potato growers in other districts to co-operate with you and receive the full benefit .to be derived from the Federal .Marketing Act. Here's to more power and success for th Federal Farm Board. </seg>
            <seg id="p706">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE INVENTING NEW POTATO VARIETIES DR. F. A. KRANTZ University of Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station, St. Paul, Minnesota The potato is one of the oldest of our cultivated food plants. It was a common article of food by the Inca of Peru at the time of the discovery of America. The cultivation of the potato by the people or Europe and North America is mostly confined to the last two cen - turies. Serious efforts to improve the crop or to secure varieties more adapted to Europe and North America were not made until 1850. All of our present varieties were Introduced between 186.0 and 1890. Hundreds of varieties were introduced during this time. Only a few have survived in commercial competition. These consti - tute the present commercial varieties. Since 1890 no new varieties of merit have been introduced. In the meantime; the areas of com - mercial development have continually expanded further west and south. The same potato varieties which were originated for Eastern conditions were depended upon to produce crops under the newer condition. The low yields prevalent in the north central states as com - pared to the eastern part of the country suggested that these varieties were not entirely adapted to the newer conditions. In 1921, work was begun to produce potato varieties better suited to the needs of the potato growers of Minnesota. The method that is being used to develop new 'varieties of potatoes is more easily understood if a few important characteristics of the potato are kept in mind. Most potato varieties are unfruitful. They do not set seed on account-of pollen sterility. Consequently, the first problem is to develop superior seed producing parents from the original Inferior seed producing varieties. Another important characteristic is the fact that potato varieties do not come true from seed. When seed of a variety is grown the resulting seedlings will vary to a consider - able degree from the parent variety. Fortunately when potatoes are grown for food they are propagated from tubers and not from seed arid the variety remains constant. The fact that potatoes are ordi - narily propagated from tubers is a distinct advantage in the improve - ment of this crop. It will be shown later how full advantage can be taken of hybrid vigor in the production of new varieties, since the vigor of a hybrid will remain constant when propagated from tubers. It will be impossible to discuss the various technical details con - nected with the breeding of new varieties of potatoes. The method can, however, be briefly illustrated. When the potato breeding work was begun, one of the objects was to develop a variety that would be as early or .earlier than the present early varieties, with a tuber </seg>
            <seg id="p707">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION type equal to that of the best late varieties, and which would be oeuer adapted to the climatic conditions of Minnesota and consequently would give a higher average yield. The method of breeding to obtain these objectives may be briefly illustrated. Superior seed producing parents were slowly developed from the original inferior seed producing varieties by inbreeding. Seedling progenies were grown from these varieties. The best of these seedlings which set seed were saved and these seedlings used as parents for the succeeding generations. This process of selecting the best seedlings in each generation to become the parents of the succeeding generation was continued until seedlings were obtained, which not only had the desired characters themselves but also gave progeny which possessed these characters, or in other words, bred true to type. Fre - quently, in order to secure the desired combinations, crossing had to be resorted to before the process of selecting out in succeeding genera - tions could be undertaken. This 1s a slow tedious process. The number of individuals In the early generations which set seed are usually very few. Since progeny can only be grown from the seed bearing individuals, selection must be confined to these. For many characters careful tests are necessary to locate the superior individuals. Consequently, progress was so slow during the first few years of the breeding work that improve - ment in breeding stock was barely noticeable. The difficulties grad - ually decreased, and more rapid improvement became possible. After eight years of work, distinct progress could be noted. Seedlings have been developed which set seed freely, possess the good characters found In our present commercial varieties, and in a number of cases are ' much superior to them. For instance, when the work was begun the only available varieties which set seed were very late maturing varieties. At the present time, seedlings have been developed which set seed and which are earlier than our earliest commercial varieties. The process of developing superior breeding stock has been briefly indicated. This breeding stock is low in vigor as compared to com - mercial varieties of potatoes. The inbreeding which is necessary in order to develop superior breeding stock Is usually accompanied by loss of vigor. Consequently, another step is necessary to produce a commercial variety. The best seedlings are crossed among themselves All possible combinations are made. The combinations which give the most hybrid vigor along with the other desirable characters are saved. The best seedlings in these combinations are then selected. Those that show superiority to the present varieties in comparative tests become the new varieties to replace the old. The potato breeding work has been in progress at the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station for nine years. Seedlings have beer, developed which are earlier than any existing variety, whose tube.- </seg>

WERNER (A brief statement of results. During the past year about 100 distinct tuber line strains ol Triumph potatoes were grown by the Department of Horticulture on the Experimental Farm in western Nebraska. These various tuber lines were all originally selected from a tuber unit plat propagated from what was originally one bushel of seed potatoes from the seed plat of one grower in 1925. The principal point of difference between these various tuber lines Is the time of maturity which probably varies from about B90 days to perhaps 130 days under north - western Nebraska dry land conditions. It has been found impossible to distinguish these different strains by vine character - istics' until tuber development has begun and then it is possible to distinguish only the most extreme types by any character - istic except differences in size of vines, the late matured plants producing the largest vines. As a general rule the early maturing types produce tubers of the best shape somewhat smaller in size and less Inclined to be knobby, etc., than do the late matur- H. O. WERNER Ing types. Differences in • scab . content have been noted but it is impossible at the present time to determine whether these differences are due to strain resistance or to the accidental escape of Infection due to condi - tions prevailing at the time that the tubers are most susceptible to Infection. As a very general rule the early type tubers yield decidedly less than the later types but under some conditions the early type tubers will frequently produce as many bushels of marketable tubers because of the smaller percentage of rough poor type and knobby potatoes. Under irrigation conditions the early type potatoes have been yielding equally as well as the later types. In tests conducted In Louisiana the early maturing types were most productive In three out of four trials. Early maturing .types planted late in June, while </seg>
            <seg id="p709">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION not quite as productive as some of the medium and late maturing types planted at that time, were more productive than any of the types planted early, that is during the latter part of May. None of the known virus diseases are present in these seed stocks, All of the tuber lines have been rigidly indexed during the last five years and splndle-tuber, mosaic, leaf roll, etc., are not present in these stocks, no plants of either of these diseases having been found during the last year either in the greenhouse while Indexing or in the seed fields. The seed stocks are being increased as pure lines for distribu - tion for certified seed potato growers; Within the very near future certification In Nebraska will undoubtedly include certification with regard to seasonal type, that is approximate time of maturity as well as with regard to disease content.

Adams, and Gus Forsling, after Inspecting the accounts of the Secre - tary-Treasurer, reported that these accounts which showed in the cash fund credits of $762.59, debits of $135.00, or~a balance of $627.58, to be correct and were approved by them and that the statement of expenditures of $1,123.11 from the state fund was also verified. (Re - ports printed elsewhere In detail.) Their report upon motion by W. L. Hawk — seconded by J. Pedrett, was unanimously adopted. Mr. Geo. Koehnke made a brief announcement concerning a change in certification policy as agreed upon by a conference at the Agricultural College, December 6th. The report of the committee on amendments to the constitution was as follows: That Article IV, Section 3 and 4, be amended to provide for election of members-at-large of the executive committee of the Asso - ciation as follows: At the annual meeting of 1930 one member shall be elected for four years and one member for three years. </seg>

Young, Jr., for 4 years. ■ Alfred W. Huling for 3 years. On motion of Hugh Beal, seconded by W. L. Hawk, and unani - mously adopted, all candidates were declared elected to office. After the awarding of the various ribbons in the 4-H Club con - tests and the presentation of the cups to the winners, the meeting adjourned at 8:30 P. M. H. O. WERNER, Secretary. MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE The first meeting of the. newly created Executive Committee was held after lunch at the Pullman Cafe in Chadron at 1:30 P. M., De - cember 11, 1930. Those present were: John Nielsen, President; J. Pedrett, Vice President; A. W. Huling, and the secretary, H. O. Werner. At the conclusion of an informal discussion the committee favored for the future either meetings at a separate place and time from other crop 'and livestock meetings of the Western Organized Agricultural movement, or that the Potato Association meetings be scheduled with - out competition, that is, that no other agricultural sessions be held simultaneously. That if potato association meetings are held at the time of. other agricultural meetings, that Is during the same week, that then one day be set aside exclusively for potato meetings with other agricultural meetings on one or two other days. </seg>
            <seg id="p716">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The taking over of the seed potato certification work by the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association as a consequence of a re - vision of the policy of the Agricultural College and the probability of a state seed certifying law was formally discussed. There was a common agreement favorable to the assumption of this activity, should the Association be requested to take it over. Details of organization were left for discussion and settlement at a special meeting to be called whenever necessary. The Secretary was instructed to continue the two bushel commer - cial pack class in the potato show as a feature to receive special emphasis. After a discussion of the former policy of the Association in send - ing a representative to the annual meeting of the Potato Association of America, it was agreed that the best policy has been a wise one from which benefits have been obtained for the potato growers. There - fore the following motion made by Pedrett and seconded by Hilling was unanimously adopted: That the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association authorize the Secretary, H. O. Werner, to attend the Annual Convention of the Potato Association of America to be held at Cleveland, Ohio, the week of December 27, 1930, and that in case he is unable to attend, then Dr. R. W: Goss shall attend said convention,- expenses to be paid from the state fund of the Association. After a discussion of some of the problems most seriously con - fronting Nebraska potato growers at the present time, the Secretary was authorized to take a trip to Chicago for the purpose of conferring with certain botanists who might be able to contribute some sugges - tions or assistance in connection with several problems, especially that pertaining to the study of cracking in Triumph potatoes. The motion was made by Kutchara, seconded by Huling and unanimously passed. Meeting adjourned subject to call whenever needed for special business in connection with the seed potato certification program, with Alliance agreed upon as the meeting place. H. O.

If there is no unfinished business the next thing is new business. ' ; SECRETARY KNUDSEN: Under new business I wish to report that I received a letter from Mr. George Jackson enclosing letters from the County Extension Agent at Chadron. I will read the letters. (The letters were read as follows): Chadron, Nebr., November 14, 1930. Mr. George Jackson, State Board of Control, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Has the Nebraska State Poultry Association made any arrange - ments concerning premiums at the Western Nebraska Organized Agri - culture? I have not heard from them and it is time to make up the premium lists. Very truly yours, (Signed) J. RUSSELL, BATIE. County Extension Agent. The above was enclosed in a letter to me from Mr. George Jackson as follows: Lincoln, Nebr., November 17, 1930. Mr. Harry Knudsen, Secretary, Nebraska State Poultry Association, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Knudsen: I am enclosing a letter received from the Extension Agent at Chadron which explains itself. I think it would be a good move for you to put up $100.00 or $200.00 from your funds to be used out there to build up the poultry industry of the west, especially turkeys. Please let me know if you decide to do anything of this kind at your earliest convenience and oblige. Yours very truly, (Signed) GEORGE JACKSON, Secretary. I replied to Mr. Jackson's letter and told him that we were not in position to allow $200.00 for this purpose or any other purpose without the board's consent. It was taken up today before the board and he assured me that an extra amount of m'oney was being set aside to be able to take care of this, but he did not say that he would not call on us later for the money if he needed it. </seg>

VICE-PRESIDENT NORBERG: It seems to me that It would be a great thing for the poultry Industry and the State of Nebraska If we were able to organize and operate an Egg Laying Contest. The board knows that Mr. Jackson is highly in favor of it and he assured us that we could get help if we decided to take it up. .. k ??' SMILEY: l rea "y be »eve there are plenty already estab - lished in the State for us to get back of. In the first place. If we do start one, who is going to take the time to take care of it We have two Egg Laying Contests in the State now; one at Columbus operated by Mr. Lipp. and one at Shelby. If we want to do anything in this regard why not get behind one or the other of these, possibly both of them. MR. MUNSEN: If we have a member of our organization in this State that has been operating an Egg Laying Contest let us give him moral and financial support and make it the official Egg Laving Contest. In this manner we would do away with any extra expense that would surely be involved in the starting of a new one. VICE-PRESIDENT NORBERG:. The Egg Laying Contests Just mentioned were unknown to me. My idea was merely to have an Egg Laying Contest in Nebraska in order to have an egg record, so if we already have an official contest I am in favor of cooperating With It. a MR. BENDER: Mr. Lipp's contest is Official. PRESIDENT THARP: I did not know there was an Egg Laying Contest going on in the State. It evidently has not been given much publicity. There has been quite .a lot of criticism in regard to the way the State Poultry Association has been handled. It seems to be the general feeling that there is not enough promotion work going on for the amount of money being spent. Some have suggested that an Egg Laying Contest should be started for the sake of promotion work, but I should think that either of these contests would be O K if we would get behind it with the State Poultry Association. * - MR. BENDER: I understand that Mr. Llpp publishes records and reports in several magazines and it seems to me it should derive some publicity from this. SECRETARY KNUDSEN: Mr. Lipp, how many birds do you now have entered in your contest? Mr. LIPP: About 19 pens with 6 birds to the pen. This in - cludes entries from South Dakota, Colorado, and Missouri. I send reports to some eight papers but not all of them publish the reports. </seg>
            <seg id="p721">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION VICE-PRESIDENT NORBERG: It is my own impression uuu i am told that the general sentiment would be more tor Nebraska breeders in these Egg Laying Contests held in this State. MR. SKINNER: I believe that the Nebraska State Poultry Asso - ciation should get behind one of these* contests and shut out the rest owing to the fact that he only has room for so many. TREASURER BURNHAM: What is your capacity, Mr. Lipp? MR. LIPP: My capacity is unlimited as I have plenty of ground to expand on and if supported by the Nebraska State Poultry Associa - tion I would be willing to shut out other entries from other states. SECRETARY KNUDSEN: Getting this thing to a point for In - formation, I don't question but what Mr. Llpp would do all he could to bring out entries but think that if the University of Nebraska and the Nebraska State Poultry Association was back of him that it would have made a big difference. What do you think of it, Fred? MR. LIPP: I would like to have the support of the University of Nebraska and the Nebraska State Poultry Association. SECRETARY KNUDSEN: Mr. Jackson is in hopes that we could stir up something for next Fall and in this regard I suggest that a committee of five be appointed to look into this matter and make a report at the State Fair in September. I also urge that no indi - vidual accept a place on this committee unless willing to give it some time in order to promote the above project. It was moved and seconded that the above be accepted, but before it was put to a vote Mr. Munsen desired some information on the other Egg Laying Contest mentioned by Mr. Smiley. MR. MUNSEN: Before the motion now before the house is put to a vote, I believe Mr. Smiley spoke of another contest. Let's hear about that one. It might be possible that if it was located in the right part of the State that it would be more desirable. Of course, this is only a suggestion. MR. SMILEY: Mr. Munsen, this other Egg Laying Contest is located'at Shelby, 25 or 30 miles from Columbus. ■ MR. MUNSEN: Then this would not be any more desirable. It was again suggested that a committee of five be appointed to investigate this proposition on Egg Laying Contests and make report at the State Fair in September and the question was carried. The President (Mr. Tharp) was named to make the appointments. PRESIDENT THARP: I make the following appointments Tor the Egg Laying Contest committee: Mr. Knudsen, Mr. Burnham, Mr. Munsen, Mr. Norberg, Mr. Skinner. The meeting now turns to the Hatchery Class and after some deliberate discussion on same a motion was made, seconded and car- </seg>
            <seg id="p722">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ried that Mr. Smiley T&gt;e given a vote of thanks for the way he spon - sored the Hatchery Class at this show. MR. MUNSEN: I am highly in favor of the Hatchery Class as in order to enter this class one must produce good standard birds. This in itself will do much toward the promotion of this association and eventually, tetter birds. MR. SMILEY: Personally, I think it a very good idea to bring in birds from the outside. If we know where we can get better pens, why not get them? This will make better business for the breeder and I believe the only salvation for the breeder. I really think it desirable to open up the Hatchery Class. PRESIDENT THARP: I have heard some criticism on this fea - ture and it came from a hatchery man. He said that he knew that some had gone out and bought birds not from hatchery Hocks and he evidently did not approve of it. TREASURER BTJP.NHAM: We must have the Hatchery Class and believe we should put more time on it to make it better. After much discussion it seemed that it was not fully understood just what the Hatchery Class was restricted to. Some were of the impression that the birds could be bought on the outside and others thought that they must be taken from our own hatchery flocks. SECRETARY KNUDSEN: It seems we haven't yet obtained the fundamental of what is right or what is wrong in the class and think it is going to take another year to iron it out. MR. SKINNER: Personally, I would like to. see it restricted to hatchery flocks, but can't see how you can do it. If he is good sport enough to go out and buy them, let hfm go ahead. Mr. MUNSEN: The question now goes back to the same old thing, "The exhibitor's bird must be raised and owned by the exhibitor," but how can we prove that it was not raised by the exhibitor, so we might just as well be quiet and let them go ahead and rely on the honesty of those concerned. PRESIDENT THARP; Is there anything else on new business? (Pause). How about the location of next year's show? SECRETARY KNUDSEN: For the sake of argument, will say that the officers and the Superintendent went up to the State Farm today and met with Dean Burr and Professor Brokaw. They took us out on the grounds and showed us the old horse barn. There is nothing in there in particular and everything that is in there could be taken out. We had assurance from Dean Burr that they would do everything they could to make the show a success if we did take it there. About 2500 people go through there a week and they are all interested in agriculture. I believe we would reach a class of people we have never reached before, as they are all wrapped up in this kind </seg>
            <seg id="p723">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION of work more or less. We wouldn't be able to get the "Uoater," as we call him, to enter the show as he wouldn't know much about it. It would have to be a free gate and consequently all we would have to work with would be the original allotment plus the entry fees. The structure is of brick construction, fully heated and lighted. The largest room is about 40x70 and we could have a judging room of the same size if we used the downstairs. Air. Jackson really felt that the show should go to Lincoln if possible and out to the State Agri - cultural Farm. However, he did say that if we thought it best to go somewhere else that he would not fight it, but would feel more kindly towards the association if we would take the show to Lincoln. 1 might also say that I received a telegram from Adolph Held at Holdrege today in reply to one I sent him regarding what Holdrege had to offer for the 1931 show. His telegram reads as follows: January 2, 1931. Harry Knudsen, Secretary State Poultry Show, Omaha, Nebraska. Holdrege is not in a position to bid tor the 1931 show. ADOLPH H. HELD. MR ELLIS: The show is welcome to come to Hastings on same terms as before, that is, free auditorium and Poultry Association would have charge of free banquet. VICE-PRESIDENT NORBERG: For further information, I also understand that we could store coops at the State Fair, grounds without any expense, that is, we could leave them there from year to year if we so desired. MR. SMILEY: I make a motion that the location of the 1931 show be left to. the board. The motion as made was withdrawn as it was thought to be unnecessary since the board always did decide this question. PRESIDENT THARP: If there is no further comment, the next thing is the election of officers. SECRETARY KNUDSEN: The officers to be elected are — Presi - dent, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer and two (2) Directors.

            <seg id="p727">POULTRY IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION DUDLEY BECK, President, Decatur D. Z. HOLCOMB, Secretary, Clay Center i The following papers were given at a meeting of the Poultry Improvement Association held during Organized Agriculture week, January 6th to 9th, inclusive, at the Agricultural College, Lincoln, . Nebraska: . POULTRY HUSBANDRY AT HOME AND ABROAD By LOYAL F. PAYNE ■ Professor of Poultry Husbandry Kansas State Agricultural College, Manhattan, Kansas Americans who attended the World's Poultry Congress and par - ticipated In the post-congress tours on the British Isles and the con - tinent this summer had many object lessons of methods and practices which might be used to advantage of this country. The unanimity of good husbandry, standardization of important practices and their educational program were outstanding features. While the British have all of. the common problems of maintain - ing vigor, controlling parasites, avoiding losses from disease and find - ing the most economical method of marketing, they seem as a group, to be further advanced m some ways than poultry raisers m America. The rather general adoption of a few principal breeds, namely, Rhode Island Reds, White Wyandottes, Light Sussex' and White Leghorns enables them to produce uniform products and to obtain good stock from many sources. First generation crosses of two of the above breeds are frequently made to increase vigor and egg production. Sanitary measures are practiced by the utilization of clean ground or wire or slat covered floors for the yotfng stock and well sodded yards for adult birds. Neither old or young birds come m close con - tact with the bare ground. Nests, feed hoppers and water vessels are frequently made accessible to the caretaker from outside the houses so the danger of introducing internal parasites or diseases on one's shoes is minimized. Some of the yards have been used by the laying flocks continuously for 25 years without apparent detrimental effects. In the numerous egg laying trials great emphasis is placed on size of eggs produced. In Northern Ireland the government calls for eggs weighing from 22 to 28 ounces a dozen for the different grades. Every hen which lays more than 50 eggs m the laying trials below </seg>
            <seg id="p728">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE me standard weight is disqualified. A compulsory act of buying and marketing eggs by weight was passed by the government in 1924 and the Irish are still enthusiastic about this system. Poultry pro - ducts marketed in Great Britain do not pass through the hands of as many middle men as is common in America. Producers often de - liver direct to jobbers who sell either to retailers or direct to con - sumers. The lapse of time from producer to consumer is so short that artificial refrigeration is not utilized. The time element is expressed in the following verse taken from a placard on the Irish educational booth: "Monday morn an egg was born, Tuesday to market 'twas taken, Wednesday nite reached London bright, Thursday met its bacon." A national mark egg scheme has been adopted in England and Wales to secure a better service of eggs for the .large consuming centers and to help home produce to capture business now going to imports. The educational system of poultry husbandry is unique. Thirty counties in England and Wales have 28 egg laying trials, 73 poultry instructors and 1150 approved poultry stations. . The poultry instruc - tors maintain close supervision over the flocks in their respective counties by advising on problems of breeding, feeding, housing, man - agment, diseases, economics and marketing. Instruction is given at farm institutions and other centers by means of lectures and demon - strations. They also supervise county egg laying trials and approved breeding stations. With this close supervision, it is obvious why good husbandry is so generally practiced. Experimental work of a fundamental nature is conducted at highly specialized institutions. For example, research in nutrition (feeding) and genetics (breeding) is done at Cambridge University. Table poultry experiments and disease researches are carried on at other institutions and at the Harper Adams Agricultural College and National Institute of Poultry Husbandry, new discoveries from the above ex - periment stations are tried in a practical way on large numbers of birds. While many of the methods of production and marketing used in America are better for us than European methods, some of the above practices might be profitably adopted in this country'. America like Europe is facing a period of business depression. It isn't confined to any one industry or group of industries, It is common to all. The poultry industry is suffering along with the other industries. A combination of circumstances is responsible for this condition in America. The increase in the fresh egg supply this fall, the largest storage holdings of market eggs on record and the general falling off in buying power of the consuming public has </seg>
            <seg id="p729">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION demoralized the market. This experience will help the industry to the extent that it will eliminate many of the unskilled and unsuccess - ful poultry raisers and in forcing those who do survive to the practice of economic measures which they have not heretofore realized were possible. During the World War, we were astounded at the results obtained from wheat free rations. Today we can hardly believe the results that are being obtained from corn free rations — rations consisting of one-half to three-fourths wheat. Those who are equipped and qualified to raise poultry should remember that changes can come quickly in this industry. It is only six to eight months from baby chick to market egg. When the changes come, those who are prepared with stock and equipment will reap the benefit. In 1917 we went through a similar experience. The years that followed were most profitable to those who were ready. A general exodus from this industry is the sign for the far seeing poultryman to stand by, keep what he has, and practice the strictest economy that is possible and consistent with good business. Reduce the number of birds to a high quality minimum, do not tolerate mediocrity in vigor, type, color or production. Use cheap grains freely in the ration but feed a balanced ration, practice sanitation and observe all the other well known methods of good management. With such a program, prices will have to go lower than they have in the past to prevent the mid-west farmer from realizing some profit, and when the farmers in this section cannot secure a profit, it is quite certain that poultry raisers in other sections are not obtaining a profit. The low cost of production will enable those In the middle west to compete with any section in the country providing the products are properly cared for and promptly marketed after they are produced. If any are in need of more information covering modern methods of feeding, housing, or managing the poultry flock, they are asked to write to. the Poultry Department at their State University or Agri - cultural College. FLOCK IMPROVEMENT FROM THE HATCHERYMAN'S VIEWPOINT By R. S. HILL Field Manager, Nebraska Poultry Improvement Association. A few years ago the number of chickens raised in Nebraska was far less than it is today. Ten years ago most of the baby chicks hatched were hatched with hens and were reared with them. As more efficient poultry equipment and management came into use poul - try raisers began to see that brooder houses and brooders were neces - sary if they were to raise poultry at a profit. </seg>
            <seg id="p730">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE- BOARD OF AGRICULTURE At about this same time a few scattered hatcheries were begin - ning to operate in the state and were endeavoring to supply poultry raisers with their baby chicks. As hatcheries were few and the demand for chicks exceeding the number produced, the big problem of the hatcherymen was to be able to hatch enough chicks. The average hatchery operator saw opportunities in expansion and some of them started hatcheries in other localities. In those days a baby chick was a baby chick and chick buyers were not particular what they bought so long as they were able to buy chicks. As time passed, more efficient incubator were made and larger hatches of more livable chicks were possible. £ - --- ■ hI h&gt;Lg- f "~ -~^*t~, ■■ ■ — /* i^jj ' Each year Poultry equipment exhibits arc held in cooperation with Lumber Dealers. Farm Bureaus and County Fairs Looking over the poultry situation in Nebraska we find hatchery operators in nearly every town and in many cases more than one hatchery in a town. During all of this time the chick buyers have become more critical of the baby chicks which they buy as he is buying chicks which he must know about if he is to succeed in the poultry business at a profit. Due to the quality now demanded of the hatcheryman by the baby chick buyer hatcherymen are beginning to realize that unless they are able to produce the quality demanded they may expect their orders to decline. ■ This has brought about a general improvement of hatchery flocks that are supplying hatching eggs to these hatcheries. The wide awake hatchery operator is vitally Interested In his flocks because they can be made either an asset or a liability. To a certain extent the hatcheries' future depends upon the quality of chicks pro - duced from these flocks. </seg>
            <seg id="p731">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Hatcheries want the kind of hatchery flocks that will produce satisfactory chicks and satisfactory chicks are chicks that go out and satisfy the buyer. • The hatchery must (1) Produce livable chicks. (2) Produce chicks that grow. (3) Produce chicks that will lay eggs. (4) Produce chicks at a profit to the buyer. Good hatchability must be had if the hatcheryman is to continue buying eggs because he is vitally interested in the percentage of hatch. However, all of these requisites go to form a satisfactory flock. What kind of flocks should produce satisfactory chicks? 1. Vigorous flocks — healthy flocks. 2. Well matured breeders — hen best. 3. Purebred. 4. Properly culled arid mated. 5. Correct number of males. 6. Production. 7. Standard quality. 8. Housing. 9. Management. 10. Feeding. The breeding flock should be given plenty of exercise. Free range when possible is very desirable and when it is impossible a pen south of the house will help. Windows that can be -opened wide allow - . ing direct sunshine are indispensable. In general, it is a good plan to feed one to two per cent of cod liver oil to the breeders from Jan - . uary first until the birds have free range. Many poultrymen feed cod liver oil the year around feeling that the vitamins therein con - tained are worth the extra cost. Poultry raisers want good chickens and appreciate any help their hatcherymen can give them. Everyone has pride and good birds cost no more to raise than scrubs. The wide awake hatcheryman has a big task ahead of him if he can render valuable service to flock owners and to chick buyers. The hatcheryman in the future must be ■ a poultryman as well as an incubator specialist for he is in a position to be of great service to his community. If he can help his customers to brood their chicks so they will live and make a profit for the cus - tomers the benefit will be mutual. Cooperation between the hatchery and flock owner is essential. The hatchery is the flock owners best customer and if the flock owner realizes this fully he will do all in his power to aid this hatchery in disposing of chicks. The more chicles that are sold means the flock owner will be able to sell his eggs at a premium longer. </seg>
            <seg id="p732">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOW CAN THE HATCHERYMAN HELP THE CHICK BUYER? By D. C. BECK — Decatur, Nebr. In assigning me the subject, "How can the hatcheryman help the chick buyer?" I presume that they thought that I had had to help a lot of the chick buyers in the five years that I have been operating a commercial hatchery, and if I should tell the truth I would say that I have. To me there are several things that most chick buyers expect of the hatcheryman. I feel that it is good sound business to do your very best to give the chick- buyer what he or she wants. I study the tastes and demands of my customers, and I find by doing so I am more able to meet the buyers wishes. I also try to gradually show and educate them along the proper course so as they can show a profitable balance at the end of the year. The buyer expects a chick that will live and do well. In meeting this demand I use only Nebraska accredited flocks for my hatching egg supply, which has proven conclusively that the program the Ne - braska Poultry Improvement Association has laid out as their standard, produces chicks of the highest livability and quality. He expects a flock of pullets that will please the eye, lay a good number of large sized eggs, and if he does not raise at least 40 such pullets out of each 100 chicks, started I feel that something has been omitted in the feeding and management of the chicks, for I have found by checking over the records of a number of my customers the past season that they have made such- a record. He wants to know what service you will give him, and under this heading, we check his equipment. He must have a brooder house of the proper size, one square foot of floor space for each four chicks in the light breeds, and three chicks to the square foot for the heavy breeds. We insist that his house have a tight wall and roof and a floor free from drafts; a brooder stove that will keep the house at the desired brood temperature; plenty of feed and water troughs and insist that everything be kept in a sanitary condition. Do not allow chicks to run in old chicken yards, move the brooder house to new ground if possible, and if it can not be moved we try to get them to use a wire floor sun parlor. If the customer happens to be a beginner in the chick business we alway call at his place and look things over in a week or ten days, unless he happens to live at too great a dis - tance. In making a personal call and looking the chicks over you will usually be able to detect any trouble they might be having, and can check up the trouble before it gets too much of a start to do anything with. </seg>
            <seg id="p733">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION The customer naturally expects the hatcheryman to know as mucn about poultry as the best informed man or woman In the community. We always try to be ready with such Information as he may desire, and if we are in doubt we always get the best authority we know of and do all we can to serve the customer to his entire satisfaction. We find that he always expects quality. We sometimes have a prospective customer come to our hatchery asking for 50 or 100 chicks, stating that they have ordered 500 or more chicks from some high pressure salesman, breeder or hatchery, and that he would like to get some Nebraska accredited chicks to raise their own male birds to mate with their high toned chicks. I want to say frankly that I do not spend too much time with this class of a customer for I have seen too much of the high toned chicks. I have had trouble the past two years • in this respect. Some of my flock owners have been taken in by this high class advertising, and it surely is just that very thing. This past season I had one good friend that paid $24 for 100 "White Leghorn chicks to raise her own cockerels for the com - ing season, and when the association inspector came to band her flock he had to cull them down better than 50 per cent. Another case where a flock owner ha'd male birds shipped all the way from Penn - sylvania here. The inspector culled out around. 40 per cent of them. I am quite sure that these people have learned their lesson, and will not be misled in the future by these flashy advertisements. The cus - tomer naturally expScts honest statements in your advertising. You must give him information on your buildings, management of your flocks and all about your breeders. He must know all about these things in order to buy intelligently, especially if he is a customer from a distance who cannot call at your hatchery. He naturally expects a profit from his chicks. All we can do to insure him a profit is to furnish him with chicks that were hatched from eggs that were pro - duced by high grade breeders, housed in well ventilated houses, fed and managed properly, and incubated in the best modern incubators. It is true that some customers expect something for nothing. i feel that some hatchery men have been to blame for a part of this. I have read some hatchery catalogs that do this very thing. I am not a believer in the 325 and 350 egg hen for the Nebraska farm flock. Apd finally the buyer expects entire satisfaction from his trans - action and we' feel that we have failed in our job if he is not satisfied in the majority of cases. This is the reason we use only the highest quality eggs from Nebraska accredited flocks, try to follow up every sale, and do our best to help our customer make money on his chicks. As an example of our follow-up methods to help the chick buyer, we had a customer that bought 500 White Leghorn chicks from our best flocks. He had the very best of equipment and his management </seg>
            <seg id="p734">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE was very near 100 per cent. He had wonderful luck with the chicks until he put them into the laying house and then they began to go light and he lost a good many. He asked several, including myself, what could be wrong. Someone convinced him he had range paralysis. Some time later Mr. Claybaugh from the Extension Department at Lincoln was in my district. I took him to look over, this flock, and after checking over his feeding program and management he decided that he was not supplying enough green feed, he was not allowing them quite enough grain, and was short on feeder space. The party corrected these troubles and his flock gradually began to come out of its trouble all right. The same party bought chicks this year and put them into the same houses and is having splendid luck. He has raised a dandy bunch of pullets and they are laying fine. You learn more by exchanging ideas than you lose by revealing secrets, and by being unselfish you really gain more business and profit than when a narrow, selfish policy is pursued. "Fear not," move ahead with a bit more than normal power and you will be surprised at your success as the year advances. Just 15 cents a day held back from circulation by each of us throws a quarter of a million out of work. A busy dollar means a busy man. Prosperity depends on you letting go of that 15 cents -dally. WANTED 900 PULLETS By JOHN H. BURGSCHAT, Florence Station, Omaha. Nebr. Every poultryman's success depends primarily upon the percentage of eggs hatched and chicks raised. The direct financial loss due to poor hatches and extreme mortality is comparatively small, but if few chicks are raised there must necessarily be few to market, and an Insufficient number of pullets to renew the laying flock. The final results, therefore, are most serious. The percentage of losses on the average poultry plant is large, as is evidenced by the commonly accepted statement, that the poultryman who hatches half and raises half has nothing to complain of. It is true that it is possible to maintain a profitable poultry plant if the losses do not exceed this proportion, but such percentages are unreasonable and with proper conditions are unnecessary. The results secured on our farm prove how needless it Is to have heavy losses when, the plant is equipped with up to date appliances and where good breeding stock is kept. Better stock, better methods and better equipment are all that are necessary in - order to reduce hatching and brooding losses to a fraction of the present rate, and no poultry man should be satisfied with the results he is securing until his losses are thus reduced. </seg>
            <seg id="p735">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION The difficulties experienced in raising sufficient number of puneis to renew or enlarge the laying flock are responsible for more failures in the poultry business than any other one cause. To maintain the laying flock on a profitable basis, however, it is not sufficient to raise just enough pullets to renew part of the flock each year. The new birds should be carefully selected. Only well grown, matured, physic - ally sound individuals should be retained in the flock, and in order to do this many more than the. necessary number of pullets must be raised to give opportunity for careful culling. The importance of this is much greater than is generally realized. A ModtTn BroodiT Houne The poultryman who does not succeed in raising pullets sufficient in number to admit of careful selection, discarding all that are in any way- inferior, will find himself carrying over unproductive old hens to their third or fourth year, a policy which is certain to lead to ultimate disaster, so for these reasons the success of the average poultry plant is determined almost directly by the success achieved in raising chicks. In setting our incubators I set enough eggs, figuring a 70 per cent hatch of all eggs set, ar.d for the last five years our hatches have never fallen below this per cent, often being higher. We set eggs only from old hens. I have not set any pullet eggs for about seven years, as I believe you will get somewhat stronger chicks from hens. We have always been able to raise at least 90 per cent of the chicks, until the past season when our mortality was less than 5 per cent up to eight weeks of age and 1 per cent after that until maturity. </seg>
            <seg id="p736">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE l will tell you briefiy how we succeed In doing this. After the chicks were hatched they were left in the Incubators until twenty-four hours old and then were placed in a hot water heated battery brooder, with feed and water placed before them immediately and kept before them all the time day and night and electric light on day and night. ' No hard grain was fed, only mash with cod liver oil, as they did not have any sunlight. I placed fifty chicks in each compartment which is 2.6x3 feet. This number was kept in each compartment until the cockerels could be distinguished, which were then removed, leaving about 25 pullets in each compartment until they were eight weeks old, when they were all feathered, and removed to colony houses without heat and turned loose on the range. Roosts were put in their houses at this time and a 15 watt light turned on at night until all had learned to roost, which took from two to four weeks. In the meantime the range seeded to clover and oats had made a heavy growth of pasture for them to range on, also keeping the range in sanitary condition. We didn't have any trouble with cocci - diosiB or -worms with this method, as they got such a good dean start in the battery on wire floors. WHAT I UKE ABOUT MY MISSOURI TYPE HEN HOUSE By MRS. E. G. LEWIS, Aurora, Nebr. My house is 32 feet square. It has a 15-foot gable. The eaves are 5 feet. The door is 3% feet wide. The roosts are 22x12 foot. It is about 7 feet from the floor to the straw loft. The sides and roof are insulated with Celotex. The first reason why I like my Missouri type house is because it is 1 dry and roomy. Although it is large and roomy, the sun reaches almost every portion of the floor some time during the day. Then, too, the straw loft aids In keeping a dry atmosphere. It absorbs the extra moisture which would otherwise just remain in the building where the chickens would likely catch cold. The straw is put about a foot deep with a little additional straw in each end for bedding purposes in bad weather when it is inconvenient to get straw elsewhere. The door is made large enough so we can take a chicken coop in or out without tipping it. And, too, we use a wheel barrow to clean up the -dropping boards and of course this makes it convenient as well as a great labor saver. The nests are on the east and west sides near the north end. A 1x4 used as a platform in front of the row of nests is also used as . </seg>
            <seg id="p737">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION a door for the nests at night to keep the hens from roosting on the nests. The dropping boards are about four feet from the north, east, and west sides and further, of course, from the south. This gives one plenty of room to get the wheel barrow around the dropping boards so they are more easily cleaned. The dropping boards are 3% feet from the floor, thus giving plenty of light even under the drop - ping boards. There are three floor windows on the north to aid in lighting under the dropping boards when the sun isn't in the right position to light all the building. There are two double windows on the east and west. On the south there are 12 windows and a space 4x12 cov - ered with muslin. The sun parlor is on the south outside the main building. It is just a little pen 6x14x3 feet and it is covered with wire. The alfalfa rack is built up so as not to get dirt in with the green alfalfa hay. The oyster shell rack is also built up oft of the floor. We have always had trouble with the chickens getting the straw around the water fountain wet. So we devised a platform which has proven very satisfactory. We cut a 4-foot hole in the floor, over which we built a platform about a foot high. This is covered with wire screening or sort of hail screen, then the water fountain is placed on this wire platform with two 2x4 's as supports, thus the waste water drips on down to the ground instead of getting the straw wet. DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMERCIAL FLOCK By J. C. HERWIG, fiumboldt, Nebr. We began the calendar year, November 1, 1929, with 500 Single Comb White Leghorn pullets that had been brooded the previous spring from 1500 chicks purchased from a well known Nebraska breeder. Our laying houses were built 20x40 laid up on the north side and both ends with 8-inch hollow title laid flat and for the south side 2x4 studdings and drop siding and all windows double glazed, and hollow tile floor overlaid with 1-inch concrete. Although we con - sidered these houses well built we soon discovered the need of artificial heat. Not deeming it advisable to materially add to our investment by installing a hot water heating plant at a cost of approximately $275 we cast about for a more economical method. As Richardson county is blessed with an abundance of natural timber we thought wood might be used as fuel. Being unable to purchase wood stoves of </seg>
            <seg id="p738">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE oimu-ient size we bought two steel lubricating oil barrels at one dollar each and converted them into hot blast stoves by setting them up on end, cutting holes in the tops as feed doors with hinged lids and 3-inch holes in the same end in which we inserted a 2-foot piece of galvanized conducted pipe to provide the draft. These stoves proved to be a success. We were able to keep our Hock comfortable during the severest weather. During January, 1930, with the temperature falling to zero and below nearly every night, our production increased from 38 per cent up to 64 per cent, and we attributed this increase largely to the fact that the temperature in the house was kept at or near 40 degrees, and we did this at a fuel cost of less than $25.00 for two 20x40 houses. We cannot speak too strongly on the necessity of artificial heat if good production is desired during the winter months. The reason just passed was one marked by extremes of heat and cold. However, we lost but five hens from heat prostration and no pullets. Our houses have windows installed on the north side and these when opened induced a good circulation of air. We had but one serious trouble with this flock after the birds came into pro - duction: that of Prolapsus of the Orviduct. We did not at first recog - nize it as such but as the laying season advanced and cases became more numerous we were convinced that such was the case. To be absolutely sure, however, we submitted two specimens for examination to the pathologists of the University of Nebraska, who pronounced it Prolapsus and assured us that it was not an uncommon occurrance in a heavy laying flock. We finally' gained control of this trouble by lowering the. protein content of the mash and feeding more green stuff, such as carrots, germinated oats, etc. About the first of last February we purchased 500 White Rocks intending to raise them for early broilers. This venture was rather disappointing. We placed these chicks in a 20x20 insulated house and we believe brooded them under ideal conditions. It soon became evident that about 20 per cent of these chicks were not as vigorous as they should have been and while our direct loss was not great, those that lived made such slow progress that they nearly offset the profit made on the other 80 per cent. We shall hence - forth purchase our chicks only from reliable breeders. During -the early spring of 1930 we erected two more houses, each 20x40, similar " to those built in 1929. We purchased 1500 Leghorn chicks from the same breeder who supplied us the year previous, receiving them March 13th and brooded them in these new laying houses, 750 chicks to a house 20x40. We did not put them out on range until they were seven' weeks old, at which- time we added a high percentage of dried buttermilk to the growing mash to prevent any outbreak of that dreaded disease, Coccidiosis. We raised a very healthy and vigor - ous flock. Our loss from all caues was 10 2/3 per cent. We made some changes in our feeding ration from the previous summer in </seg>

            <seg id="p740">. NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION that we fed these pullets more grain than mash, the object bc... b ..« retard somewhat the too early development, but in spite of all we could do, production began at 18 weeks of age and continued until November, at which time they began to molt. This process, of course, we did not relish, and knew of no method of overcoming it. In fact it is a natural process and the best we could do was to speed it up as much as possible by using artificial lights in the morning and feeding a wet mash at noon moistened with milk. This has helped some and a large percentage are back on the job again. This was our first experience in feeding wet mash, and the pullets relished it greatly. We have -extended this method of feeding to our entire Hock, thereby increasing the mash consumption. In the general manage - ment of our flock we have endeavored as near as possible to follow the suggestions as outlined by the Poultry Department of the College of Agriculture. We use the mash formulas submitted by the poultry department. For an early summer green feed we grow' rape of which the birds are very fond, and later we grow sudan grass. Our houses are built with a view of reducing labor to a minimum. Water is piped into the building directly from the mains, the supply line hung over - head with all waterers standing directly under the faucets and no water is carried in pails. We do not see how we could much Improve on this system. Previous to September 1, 1930, we had sold our product to local dealers only. Since September we have shipped all our eggs to whole - salers in New York City, receiving a premium of ten and twelve cents above local buyers' quotations. We use extreme care in packing and grading our eggs for this trade, using only new cases, cupped flats, and white spruce fillers. Shipment is made by express not less than twice a week. There is one phase in the management of a flock of year old hens that has somewhat puzzled us, viz: what to do with the early molters? Shall we keep them over or shall we dispose of them as being un - profitable producers? It has been repeatedly stated by good authori - ties that early molters do not come back into production much sooner than those hens that continue production for eleven or twelve months. To satisfy ourselves as to the soundness .of this .theory, we marked tome of the worst offenders and carried them over, and found that the theory Is correct. Hereafter we propose to cull out all birds that molt before September 1. No. hen has any business to "lay off" four to four and one-half months in one year. "Very often the difference between profit and loss hinges upon this one thing, proper culling. It is certainly more profitable to own a flock of 500 birds producing from 182 eggs and up per bird, annually, than a flock of 750 birds producing only 80 to 125 eggs per bird. The production of poultry and poultry products has gone up steadily in Nebraska during the past eight or nine years, not only </seg>
            <seg id="p741"/>
            <seg id="p742">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in quantity but also in quality. A large percentage of the eggs pro - duced in Nebraska at present will grade as extras and are equal in quality to any that are being shipped to eastern markets. We hear a great deal, about the superior quality of Pacific coaBt eggs. Why should this be so? We grow here in Nebraska all the different grains and grasses necessary for the feeding of a flock and are not obliged to ship grain from other states as California does. Another advantage is that we have more days of sunshine annually than California, according to United States government statistics, and we are 1500 miles nearer than they to New York City markets, but in spite of these natural advantages California eggs top the market. We can think of two reasons for this condition. The first is persistent adver - tising of California products, and the second is the forming of strong cooperative marketing organizations doing their own grading and packing and shipping in carload lots and dealing with eastern buyers on this quantity basis. We see no good reason why an organization of this kind would not be able to function here in our state if a sufficient number of producers were of a mind to put it over. If this method works well in California It could work equally well here in Nebraska. There is no doubt but that we would all like to peer into the future to see what is in store for us in the poultry industry for 1931 and make our plans - accordingly. In a recent issue of a popular poultry magazine there appeared an editorial entitled "Poultry Outlook Is Good," in which the editor endeavored to show that there is still a profit to be made in the industry. In the following issue of the same magazine the editor received som.e rather caustic replies from his readers, for painting the picture in such roseate hues. However, we think the editor was correct in many of his views, especially as regards prices of feed compared with 1929. Corn a year ago sold above one dollar and today we buy it for 65 cents, wheat $1.25 now 68 cents, oats 60 cents now worth 42 cents, bran $1.30 now 90 cents, and so on down the line, and while prices of eggs are much lower than last year, it does not cost as much to produce them. In making our plans for 1931 it should be our aim to purchase chicks from reliable breeders only and from flocks of known high egg records, and let us not be misled by cut prices from fly-by-night hatcheries and dealers, be they radio spellers, or cheap paper advertisers. High producing flocks, proper management and an efficient outlet for a high class product will help materially In bringing back pros - perity to the poultry industry. </seg>
            <seg id="p743">■ NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION A SUMMARY OUTLINE GIVING THE TIME SPENT ON THE CAKE OF HIS POULTRY By FRANK BIFFAR, Blair, Nebr. In case I cannot come to the meeting Tuesday, January 6, I am giving you the information the best I can. I can tell it better than I can write It. I will start mixing feed the first thing. I mix my scratch grain on the cement floor in the corn crib and granary where it is handy to the grain bins. I generally mix every day because I have no extra bins to put it in. Time, about 1% hours per month. I make and mix my own mash and do my own grinding. The grinding I charge to the ground feed. I use a seven foot stock tank to mix mash in and being round it is very handy to mix in. I generally mix from 1000 to 1200 pounds at a time. It takes about 35 minutes to mix a batch, or about one and one-half hours to mix a month's feed. A Poultry unit comparable to the other enterprises of the farm will return a comparable income The time required to feed and care for 1000 hens depends on how you have things arranged and how often you feed. I have my hens under lights for the first time and am following a program of feeding grain three times a day. The lights come on at 5:30 o'clock for the morning feed and I feed again at about 11:30 o'clock, and the evening feed at 4:30 o'clock. The location of the houses is also a factor in time required to feed and water. I am using my brooder house so it requires a few extra steps as I have to carry water to them. We have automatic waterers in the main laying house. Time required to feed each day, 25 to 30 minutes, or about 15 hours per month. </seg>
            <seg id="p744">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD- OF AGRICULTURE We feed mash every other day. That is, we replenish the hoppers with mash and it takes about 3 hours a month. We fill the oyster shell hoppers once a month, more or less, and It takes around 15 minutes to do the job. During the freezing weather the kerosene lamps under the water - ers must be taken care of. This winter so far we haven't had very much use for the lamp but in freezing weather they have to be tilled every four or five days and a month's care will amount to about one hour, I should say. Ventilation is one of the very important chores In caring for the flock. Part of the time it can be taken care of when you feed, but that depends on weather conditions. The muslin curtains must be opened or closed to the best advantage for the hens. It is almost as Important as feed and water and the time for taking care of the ventilation varies considerable as it can be looked after with the other chores of the flock.. Time, I would say, not less than one or two hours per month. Health also must be looked after. While it may not' require much time, the good poultry man has his eye constantly on the flock for anything that may appear. It is hard to tell how much time, but you. can spend an hour or more and never know it. Next to health is culling; that is, keeping an eye on the hen that is not profitable and remove her from the flock at least once a month. I do not spend a lot of time culling in the winter months, but I do it every month, taking an hour, more or less. Cleaning out the laying house is a job that varies according to conditions and weather. We aim to clean once a month, removing all litter and replacing new. If it is damp it may have to be removed much oftener. Cleaning out once a month under favorable conditions and hauling it to the field and replacing litter will take from eight to ten hours a month. This includes putting new litter in the nests also. Cleaning dropping boards every day or at least every two or three days is important in keeping the eggs clean as well as making the house more sanitary. Time required for cleaning them will vary according to conditions and will run around ten hours a month. Gathering eggs in the winter months will not require as much^ time as the spring months because if you have part of your flock old hens they are recovering from the molt while the pullets are laying and it will take a person about 10 to 15 minutes to gather eggs, or about six hours a month. And the next thing is packing eggs, a task that can be done In a hurry or it can require quite a little time. If you just throw them into "the case in any old way they come or you' can take time </seg>
            <seg id="p745">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION and make a good job of it and it will require 10 to 15 minutes a day and about six hours during the month. Electric lights will also require a little time and attention to wind the clock and turn them off. Now to sum up the time of the different jobs caring for the Hock, and It sums up to the surprising amount of almost 58 hours for the month and amount to the grand total of 290 hours or 32 nine hour working days for five winter months. This may vary considerable with 'different flocks. My flock is a side line with my farming interests and it is not equipped as some commercial egg firms may be. BATTERY BROODING— ITS POSSIBILITIES AND PROBLEMS By H. A. BITTENBENDER Buckeye Incubator Co:, Springfleld, Ohio Battery brooding is a new phase of the poultry industry. There is yet a great deal to learn in how to get the most out of raising chickens in batteries. The use of batteries, however, is very definitely becoming a part of the hatchery program and a thorough under - standing of the advantages of battery brooding cannot be disregarded by any progressive hatchery man today. I think it is advisable to discuss battery brooding from several points of view. First — Storage brooder for holding surplus chicks or holding chicks until called for by the customer. Recent experimental evidence shows very conclusively that the earlier chicks are fed after hatching the better the results. That is, chicks that are required to go too long without their first food do not live as well as those that are fed earlier. The exact length of time varies considerably. It is safe to say that under no conditions is it advisable to wait more than 48 hours after the chicks are taken from the incubator. Better results are obtained when the chicks are fed earlier. The old theory that if chicks were fed too early caused high mortality and failure of the yolk to absorb has been disproved. It is safe to feed chicks as soon as they are obtained from the hatchery and early feeding starts chicks to grow sooner and assists in the absorption of the yolk rather than retards. Second — Sale of started chicks three weeks to six weeks of age. There are some people that cannot spend the time to give baby chicks the detailed care necessary for proper brooding. During the first three weeks the chick's life adequate and correct temperature is very im - portant. A good battery brooder solves this problem. After three to six weeks of age the chicks can go out in colony brooder houses with less danger of chilling and improper brooding conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p746">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE .third — Sale of pullets. There is an ever increasing demand for pullets. The battery brooder serves as an excellent means for carrying the chicks until sex can be determined. The cockerels can be carried through the battery until they are .of marketable age and the pullets told from six to eight weeks of age. Fourth — Type of battery brooders. There are two distinct types of battery brooders, the one type commonly known as the heated room ■ and the other type known as the heated battery. The heated room type of battery brooder can be used most economically in the larger installations. The temperature, ventilation and humidity in this- type of battery brooding is automatically controlled. In the heated battery the source of heat is usually either electric or hot water. In some electric batteries, the source of heat is from bulbs and in others from heat elements. Extreme caution should be taken in the purchase of a battery brooder that the heat is adequate. In most cases it is advisable to place the battery brooders in rooms that have additional heat, other than that supplied in the batteries. For best results, the room temperature should be kept from 70 to 80 degrees. The source of heat in the batteries is used to bring the temperature above the room temperature to the desired brooding temperature. Brooding Temperature in Batteries In the room type of battery brooder the correct temperature for starting chicks is 88 to 90 degrees, with a wet bulb reading of 78 degrees. If the humidity is low the temperature will have to be high. There is a close relationship between temperature and humidity. The best results in battery brooding are obtained when the relative humid - ity is kept high. This is decidedly contrary to our other method of brooding, where it is the aim to keep the brooder as dry as possible, but in battery brooding, we have not been able to obtain too high a humidity for best results, as we have adequate ventilation. After three weeks of age, the temperature can be reduced to 80 or 85 degrees. At six weeks of age further reduce the temperature from 70 to 80 degrees. In the battery brooders where individual heat is supplied, or a warm and cold compartment type of brooder, the start - ing temperature should be 95 to 100 degrees and gradually reduced as the chicks become older. Here again special attention should be paid to keeping the humidity high. Brooding Capacity There is apparently no standard battery, each manufacturer mak - ing different sized compartments. In our research work we have found that from 9 to 10 square inches of tray area should be provided for each chick from one to three weeks of age. That is, if 125 chicks are to be placed in each compartment there should be from 1125 </seg>
            <seg id="p747">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION to 1250 square inches of heated tray area. For the chicks from one week to three weeks of age one opening for feed and water space for each two chicks. After the chicks are three weeks of age, at least one opening for water and food for each chick. After three to six weeks of age, double the tray area should be provided, that is, 18 to 20 square inches per chick. At six weeks of age, if they are to be carried to two pounds or more in weight, the tray area should be doubled again', that is, 36 to 40 square inches' per chick. Feed In view of the fact that the chicks raised In battery brooders cannot obtain direct sunlight it is very essential that a good quality feed be provided. The feed should be properly mixed or balanced and contain a biologically tested and proved cod liver oil. It is neces - sary that the ration be complete with respect to vitamins and minerals for the reason that the chicks cannot get out of doors and obtain any other nutrients than those furnished in the feed. In remodeling Poultry houses plans often include increasing the depth, allowing direct sun light to enter and screening all openings to prevent sparrows from entering Sanitation Sanitation is often overlooked by battery brooder operators for the reason that they feel that it'is impossible for disease to be trans - mitted in battery brooders. Such is not the case. It is very essential that the battery brooders be kept absolutely clean. Disease germs can spread through the air and be taken through the respiratory tract as well as through the digestive tract. For best results the brooder room and battery must be kept spotlessly clean. The use of well known disinfectants and formaldehyde gas is essential in keeping the brooder room clean and the chicks healthy. </seg>
            <seg id="p748">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Problems Observed in Battery Brooding Cannibalism — Cannibalism, feather picking, etc., is a habit and once that it gets started in the battery brooder It is rather difficult to correct. We have found that cannibalism is largely due to im - proper management. It may be due to improper lighting. It may be caused by the chicks becoming too nervous and excited. Preven - tion is far better than an attempt to cure. Never let it get started and if it does start correct it by removing the cause. Keep the chicks contented. Do not allow- them to get nervous and see that there are no sharp, well defined shadows caused by improper distribution of the light. Hock Disease— This is sometimes called "slip tendons." The result is an enlargement of the hock and loss of control of the chick's legs. It may affect one and oftentimes both legs. It very seldom appears before the chicks are three weeks of age. Up to the present time no one has definitely proved what is the cause. Our observation has been that it is worse if the feeding is long. Cutting down on the length of feeding day to 12 to 14 hours, keeping the birds quiet and giving them rest is as satisfactory as any. Bare Backs — So far as I can remember we have always had some bare backs. Recent years have developed more bare back chicks in some flocks than others. Battery brooding has also developed a good many. As far as battery brooding is concerned this condition .can be corrected if it is due to management. IT, however, the bare* backs are due to faulty breeding the battery brooder cannot correct this. To prevent bare backs due to faulty management in the battery, keep your humidity high. Do not allow your chicks to become nervous. If they start picking feathers correct your management. If the cage is too high or if the compartment is too long so that the birds mill around a great deal, it seems that the birds feather poorly. However, the best way to determine whether bare back is inherited is by observ - ing all of the chicks. If some of the chicks are feathering well and others are not, inheritance may be playing a very important part. If the feathers are broken on the ends, are dry and frayed, the humidity is probably too low. Keep the humidity high from the very first and you will observe that the chicks are more satisfactory and that the feathers are less brittle. If there are too many chicks in the compartment, rubbing together breaks off the feathers and they do not feather as well. Brooding chicks in battery brooders afforrts an excellent oppor - tunity for the skilled poultryman to prove his ability. If you do not have success in the first attempt do not blame the method but study, from the standpoint of equipment, chicks, feed and managment, the problem of battery brooding. One or all may. be at fault. All of these factors must be well balanced If you are to obtain satisfactory results. </seg>
            <seg id="p749">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Nearly every person has far better success the second year than they did the first. Without doubt in the next five years we will see a decided increase in the number of chicks started in battery brooders. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH NEWER BROODING METHODS By FRANCIS WITMUS, Ft. Crook This subject to most of ub means more sanitary methods than we have been using heretofore. We found that what is worth doing at all is worth doing well. Expensive equipment is all right but Is not necessary. The main thing Is to clean up and keep the houses clean which are used for brooding. I , Our old brooder house is 10x16 feet. Last spring we built a new brooder house 10x12 feet according to plans furnished by the Exten - sion Department of the College of Agriculture. This house has a sun parlor 4x9 feet on the south side. It is inexpensve and easy to keep clean. We found that a sun parlor added much to the success we had with our chicks last year. It provided a place for the chicks to get fresh air and direct sunshine without getting onto the ground which was polluted by the old chickens. At night and during rainy weather this porch was kept covered to keep the litter dry. As the hot weather came on we kept it partly covered to provide shade and shelter from the wind. We used electric brooders and found them very satisfactory and also not too expensive to operate. A 56-inch brooder was used for 300 chicks. At first we used peat litter on the iloor. This litter was left on the floor two weeks then it was cleaned up and some more peat used for two more weeks. By this time the chicks were large enough to get along with Btraw HCier, which had to be taken out and replaced every week. The feeders and waterers were kept on hardware cloth racks through which the droppings could fall and not be picked up and eaten by the chicks. We used home made feeders with a revolving reel along the top to keep the chicks out of the feed and also to keep them from roosting on the feeders. For watering we used the earthen-ware crocks with plates. They are eaSy to keep clean and they keep the chicks from polluting the water because they cannot step in it or roost on top of the waterers. Good ventilation was provided.' </seg>
            <seg id="p750">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE At the age of eight weeks the chicks were old enough to go on roosts and did not need artificial heat. At this time we put the cockerels in a separate house and moved the brooder houses out in the field to clean ground. Each house was enclosed for a few days with a roll of wire cribbing until the pullets got used to going into their -own houses. Then the wires were taken away. These houses were cleaned once a week and every three weeks they were moved several rods to clean ground and new range. Blocks were placed under the skids of these houses to raise them on the ground high enough to give the chicks room to get under them for shade and shelter. Fresh water was carried to these chicks three times a day. By next spring we hope to have the water piped out to the field. An all mash feed was kept before these chicks at all times. October 25th, after some pullets had started to lay, we moved them to the laying house which had been thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed with lye. NEWER BROODING METHODS By FRANK A. MITCHELL, Hooper, Nebr. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, and Fellow Poultry Raisers: As my talk is supposed to be Newer Brooding Methods, a topic that would take at least a half day to cover with any thoroughness, I will but try and give the high points of my experiences. My real start in using so-called commercial methods began four - teen years ago. My wife having this far raised the chicks via a small Incubator, the broody hen and outdoor coops, coping with lice, mites, rats and rainstorms, with such success as now seems nigh impossible, but which I sure felt I was going to beat like nothing. So I told her that as I felt she had plenty of cares raising a family, if she would help me hatch them I'd get a few more incuba - tors, a couple of those new hover type wick kerosene 1000 size brooders, cement the floor of a 12x14 brooder house and show her how to raise chickens. Well, we hatched 1200 nice healthy chicks but between damp cement floor, gas from the wick brooder stoves, sanitation, improper feeding and even lice after the chicks got to running outside, as my brooder house was built not over ten feet from my old hen house, I raised less than SO chicks. This took the conceit out of me, for having read articles in all kinds of poultry journals and bulletins, I thought I knew all about it. Well I went through the box brooder stage both indoors and outdoors. The wife again helped m*» even to the extent of taking </seg>
            <seg id="p751">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION entire charge at times. I finally got to using a coal brooder, a New Town largest size, or heating the entire brooder room stage in a new brooder house built some distance from the old poultry houses. I then started to practice sanitation, first using alfalfa leaves and later peet litter on the floor. Now I started to have better luck and the better luck I had the harder I studied to find my mistakes. And this is what I found. First, properly, even heated room. Second, sanitation. Third, proper feed and water. Fourth, proper ventilation. I have solved my problems as follows: Proper heating, either a large size coal stove or a modern oil burner. Sanitation by stages — first, clean litter with about half the floor covered with hardware cloth on frames on which I forced chicks to roost at night to prevent crowding and getting droppings out of reach of chicks. Third, feed and water came easily, as anyone can now buy good starting mash or with a little pains can mix your own. Also sanitary waterers can be bought anywhere. The housing question came last, and here is how I met it. 1 built two new brooder houses 12x20 feet, four feet six eaves, eight feet front, double walled ceiling and all with a four-inch dead air space between the walls and an extra thick covering of good roofing on the roof. I used the double wall ventilation system; two out and two in in each house, using four double windows hinged in center fixed to open from the top as desired. I put a 2x4 every 9% inches on the floor and covered this with a good grade of %,-inch hardware cloth. Next I built a self-feeder along the entire back wall and across one end and installed one of the largest size Simplex oil brooders in the center of each house, putting a division fence in the house the ' first week. Plenty of good waterers, and having a binder transport axle built into cells so as to move house at will with a tractor. X put the houses out onto a mixed sweet and red clover pasture twenty rods from the old yards and by killing any birds not looking well 1 succeeded in raising 1900 out of 2100 chicks started. I am not satisfied yet but proud of the difference in my first year's poultry fourteen years ago and the year just past. </seg>
            <seg id="p752">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD. OF AGRICULTURE WHAT THE CONSUMER THINKS OF OVU EGGS AND 1'OULTltY By CLARA GEBHARD SNYDER Director, Foods and Nutrition, U. S. Egg Society Producers and handlers of eggs and poultry have been a long time coming to the place where they have begun to show an interest in the consumer and his wants. Considering the economic importance of the poultry industry this seems rather a backward state of affairs. I wonder how many other food industries whose annual value amounts to a billion, four hundred million dollars have failed to take into consideration the consumer's point of view. Obviously, if you do not give the consumer what he wants, he fails to buy or he develops something else that will serve his purpose just as well. And if he does not buy, the industry suffers. It is true, of course, that a pro - ducer can put on the market a certain item and then make the con - sumer want it, but that process is a vastly more expensive one than finding out what the consumer wants and then giving it to him, pro - vided his wants are reasonable and worthwhile. Other industries have studied the consumer's needs and wishes and have profited by what they have learned. Canners, for example, realized that there was a place for the necessarily expensive fancy pack fruit of perfect shape, color and large size. But they saw also that not every consumer could use this pack, nor could many of them use it all the time. There was a place for the less nearly perfect, smaller fruits and vegetables, but they had to be made desirable to the buyer. So the canners sorted the fruits and put all of one size and kind together. Then they told the housewife what they had done and what the advantages of such a plan were for her. I need not elaborate on the success of the canning industry. I want simply to remind you that at one time, not so many years ago, canned goods were decidedly in disrepute, yet today few of us would care to keep house without access to commercially canned foods. This grading and sorting and labelling of various qualities is continuing to the great satisfaction of the consumer. s Since I am talking about consumers, it seems advisable for me to explain now whom I mean when I use the term "consumer," for it is a broad term and may cover a multitude of people. Ordinarily we think first of the individual homemaker, for many of the marketable commodities are used directly or indirectly in the home. ■ But Important as the home is as a consuming center for eggs and poultry, there are other consumers whom we cannot afford to overlook. There are, for example, the bakers. Uhen we realize that the bakers of this country use annually a billion eggs we can readily see </seg>
            <seg id="p753">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION that their demands require special consideration. . Then there aie me mayonnaise manufacturers, the confectioners, the noodle makers, and many others. Nor must we forget the hotels and restaurants, for a survey made recently by a food company showed that ot the 24 billion dollars spent annually for food by the American people, VZ per cent, or almost 3 billion dollars, is spent through the restauraitts. The menus of the hotels and restaurants of this country can greatly affect any food industry. In discussing my subject, I shall talk first about eggs, and then if there is time I will say something about poultry, for it is rather difficult to take them together. Yet in general the same things apply to both. Dr. Rice of Cornell University says that poultry meat is just a by-product of the egg producing industry. For almost a' year now the United States Egg Society has been making a study of consumers' wants and information. We have visited dozens of grocery stores and meat markets, bakeries and mayonnaise manufacturers, hotels and restaurants. In one sentence I can tell you what all of them think: they think they are getting entirely too many poor grade eggs and poultry. They cannot con - sistently get what they want, that is, tine, dependably good eggs. It is true that not all of these people know what they mean when they ask for better eggs. They are not at all sure what the qualities of fine eggs are, but they have no doubts as to what the qualities of some of the poor eggs are that they have got in the past and that they all too frequently still get. Telling the consumer what good eggs are is one of the tasks the industry must do, just as the dairy industry undertook to tell people what good milk and cream are and what the value of those products is to them. Probably the most logical way to discuss with you the consumer's wants will be to take up each group of consumers individually. Let us start with the homemaker. When she goes to market her object is to buy the most of what she wants for the money she can spend. What she wants is not always represented by quantity. It may be, and more and more frequently it is, quality. And quality begins on the farm. No matter Tiow carefully eggs are handled and refrigerated after they leave the producer, if they were of poor quality originally, they will be of still poorer quality when they reach the consumer. One bad egg In a dozen will spoil the homeniaker's desire to buy an - other dozen. Yet one egg out of every dozen that reaches the market • is bad. This means that five and one-half million dozen eggs spoil before they reach the consumer's table. In what other food industry is such a huge waste tolerated? Last summer when I was making a survey of grocery stores 1 found in one of Chicago's finest food stores this sign over the egg counter. "Our eggs are boilably, poachably, fryably fresh." That </seg>
            <seg id="p754">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ». su D eemed funny to me at first! But the more I thought about it the less funny it became, for I realized that the sign was a real indication of what passes in the customer's mind when she buys eggs. Every egg that reaches the consumer should bo of boilable, poachable, fryable quality. You don't find merchants displaying signs saying, "Our milk is drinkably fresh." That is taken for granted. There is a certain standard below which market milk may not fall. But not so with eggs. We can still find every imaginable variety, if one has the courage to do the imagining. It happens that I don't have to imagine, for last summer I bought two dozen eggs and had to throw away ten of them. And that was just one experience. The homemaker Is not concerned so much with getting eggs that weigh 194 pounds per dozen, though she prefers the large eggs, of course. But she Is concerned with getting twelve unquestionably good eggs per dozen. She wants dependable interior quality, whether the eggs are large or small. This is true of the homemaker who can afford to buy only one or two eggs at a time as well as of her more pros - perous sister who buy two, three or four dozen, or even a case at a time. In one of the poorer districts of Chicago where I watched housewives buy their groceries, a number of them purchased one egg. One woman, especially, said she wanted one of the best eggs the merchant had, for the doctor had recommended an egg for her baby. It so happened that the grocer had three grades on hand, ranging from 22 cents a dozen to 37 cents. The customer bought one of the highest priced grade, and I could not help hoping, as she went away, that she had not got the bad one in the dozen. This is merely an example of the situation everywhere. Consumers want quality and they are wining to pay for it. There are no halfway measures in egg quality. Either an egg Is good or it is not. As a general thing, the egg and poultry industry has not taken advantage of the Importance of appearance in influencing the con - sumer's purchases. Clean eggs of uniform size, color and shape make an attractive display, and attractiveness encourages buying. Graded eggs suggest quality by their very appearance, yet the merchant has not always found it possible to buy enough such graded eggs. Of course, attention to external qualities alone will not be enough. The interior must bear out what the exterior promises. So far the only specification the homemaker has made for eggs is that they shall be good. She has not defined what she means by a good egg, largely because she does not know. The industry does know, and It is our business to pass on that information to the user of our products, so that' she may use them intelligently and therefore economically. The large-quantity consumer, on the other hand, does make cer - tain specifications. His special problems have led him to make special demands. The hotel and restaurant people, for example, are con- </seg>
            <seg id="p755">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION cerned with the color of the egg yolk as well as with the color of the shell and the size of the egg. When a guest orders bacon and eggs for his breakfast or luncheon, the yolks of those eggs must be of approxlmaely the sanie color. If one is a- deep orange and the other lemon yellow, the guest is suspicious of one or both eggs, and the service lacks esthetic appeal. Consumers do not yet understand that yolk color is not necessarily an indication of quality. The fact that yolk color is largely a matter of feeding is just another one of the things we must teach the consumer. But because people do not generally know this now, chefs and catering managers are buying their eggs from producers whose flocks are fed controlled rations, so that yolk color will be approximately uniform. Another demand that the chef makes is that the yolk sac be strong enough so that he can fry or poach the egg without breaking the yolk.- The catering man - ager at the Edgewater Beach Hotel told me that, on an average, eight dozen out of every case of thirty. dozen eggs break when they are put into the frying pan. Those broken eggs are a total loss in these fine hotels. Another chef told me that he would not cook an egg for a guest unless he could pick up the raw egg in his fingers without breaking the yolk. Those are severe tests, it is true, but if that is the kind of eggs hotel people demand, It is up to the producer to supply them. Incidentally, when chefs make these demands of the egg and poultry industry they are asking no more than they are asking, — and in many cases already getting, from other industries, such as the fruit and vegetable people. Moreover, catering to this fancy trade is the kind of business that makes money. The baker has some thought about eggs, too. He, too, is inter - ested in yolk color. Unlike the hotel trade which prefers lemon colored yolk, the baker likes rich, orange colored yolks. Gold cake made with pale yolks turns out to be silver, cake. A gold color in many cakes suggests richness. Artificial coloring can be used, but it is not entirely satisfactory, and high class baker dislike to use it. The director or research of one large bakery corporation warned me that egg pro - ducers would do well to give serious thought to the wants of the baker. "For," said she, "our concern alone uses 9,000,000 pounds or eggs annually, and we are only one concern. If the egg people don't give us what we want we'll find a substitute, just as we did for butter." We may smile when folks talk about egg substitutes, for up to the present time they have not been very successful, it is true. But science is clever. Just because a thing does not exist today is no guar - antee that it will not exist tomorrow. In fact, almost any number of the technical chemistry magazines carries a notice of application for patents for egg substitutes. Eventually there may be a satisfactory one. The time may come when bakers order their egg yolks by color. One large mayonnaise manufacturer in New York City already does </seg>
            <seg id="p756">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE so, and has been doing so for some time. A tentative color scheme for eggs has been worked out, each color represented by a given number. The buyer then can order by number and be fairly sure that he Is getting what is best adapted to his product, so that he can guarantee his customers a uniform product under his brand name. Then there is the matter of the thickness or viscosity of egg white. A thick, viscous white will yield a larger volume when beaten than will a thin, watery white. The larger the volume of beaten white, the greater its leavening power, and consequently the larger will be the volume of the baked product. Bakers are interested in these matters, for to them they mean dollars and cents. So far bakers have found that April eggs rank highest in viscosity, and so they are ordering huge quantities of April eggs frozen and held for them. Prom the point of view of the producer what does all this mean? It means that he is going to have to adopt those methods in poultry management which will yield the type of product the consumer wants. Fortunately, egg quality can largely be determined by proper ' feeding and handling. Telling you how to do these things is not within the scope of my talk or my ability. There are many sources of informa - tion for the producer who wants to avail himsulf of them. But no matter how carefully eggs are produced, if the eggs are not handled so as to maintain their original fine quality, the producing labor Is lost. Milk producers have learned that milk must be cooled at once. Eggs are highly perishable, too, yet all too seldom are they handled as if they were. No matter how promptly the large handler cools his shipments, if the eggs were allowed to deteriorate on the farm they have a good start on the way to contributing to that live and one-half million dozen that are bad before they reach the con - sumer. The first problem is to produce good eggs, and the next, and equally important one, is to keep them good. One big job, from my point of view, that the industry must face is that of building up in the consumer faith in their product. This can be done only by consistent selling of good eggs and poultry so that the purchaser will know he is getting what he is paying for. I sometimes wish eggs had transparent shells, so we could see what is happening to them when we are . careless and how well they are keeping when we are careful. The fact that the shell may cover up the proverbial multitude of evils makes the occasional temptation to "put something over" on the buyer doubly strong at times. As an example of what I mean by "putting something Over" let me tell you an experience I had during Christmas week. While I was calling at a wholesale house a shipment of eggs came in. Among them were eleven cases labelled especially as being high grade fresh eggs. The buyer had paid a premium for them. I watched the candler check </seg>
            <seg id="p757">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION those eggs. He clicked them in his hand, three at a time, and shook his head. Then he held them before the candle and remarked. "1 thought so." In response to my questions he explained that out ot those eleven cases there were two and a half cases of eggs which had been held in waterglass by some ambitious producer who hoped in that way to get a premium on his eggs. That sort of thing is for - tunately not generally practiced, yet it has happened often enough to make the consumer suspicious. And it is the sort of thing that is scarcely conducive to building up consumer confidence. What X have said about eggs is also true of poultry. Here, too, improvement in quality, accompanied by grading, is important. Feu meats delight a consumer more than fine poultry meat, but few things repel him more than poor poultry. I wish you might have some of the turkeys and chickens I saw in some Chicago stores during the holiday season. It made me sick to see and to smell them. Much of the condition of those birds, of course, was due to poor handling, but they very obviously had been of exceedingly poor quality originally. Some time ago I heard the president of the retail meat men's organization say that the firm that puts out a high grade article will evenually surpass the one which employs experts to figure up how many thousands of dollars can be accumulated by a little trim - ming here and there and a little more fat added in another place. I should like to revise his statement to say that I believe that the producer who pays a generous amount of attention to producing quality eggs and poultry will eventually surpass the one who devotes all his time and attention to producing quantity eggs and poultry, with no consideration for quality. Consumers are willing to pay for what they demand, but if they cannot get wliat they want they will simply buy something else. Graded eggs are one thing the consumer has a right to expect. Other foods are graded, why hot eggs and poultry? It is true these products are graded for the wholesaler, but up to the present time few of those grades have been carried through to the housewife. It is a fact that since Canada has required that all eggs displayed in retail stores be plainly marked' with official grades, con - sumption of eggs has greatly increased. When eggs are graded the higher grades bring better- prices, and improvement in quality grad - ually follows. When this happens there need be little concern in our minds as to what the consumer thinks of our eggs and poultry, for he will know that he is getting full value for the money he spends. That knowledge, in turn, will encourage him to. buy more eggs and poultry, and so the industry will gradually be put on a sound basis. If we want increased consumption — and we do — we must give sym - pathetic ear to what the consumer wants, for the consumer's wants are laws the disregard of which exacts serious penalty. </seg>
            <seg id="p758">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE EGGS AS WE FIND THEM IN NEBRASKA By O. J. McCRACKEN State Department of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebr. The egg industry has improved until today it is one of the leading industries in Nebraska. With the attention it deserves, it is destined to be one of the greatest farm relief measures in Nebraska, repre - senting one of the smallest comparative outlay of capital. The enforcement of the law pertaining to the marketing of eggs is one of the many duties of the Department of Agriculture. From the number of prosecutions filed this year for violation of the egg candling law, it would seem that the department is seeking oppor- ' tunities for hauling people into court. The opposite, however, is the intention of the enforcement officers. It is only in cases of necessity E.NEBR. ,V TiGy fh.cken * 2S3PW BSVouuniY \^ ana LmcKen IA fS|A| UgSOClATlOH V Healthful Economic^ ki6 ' m 'Jt»MH life- iSliBiMBl i I EXHIBIT AT THE NEBRASKA STATE FAIR that a prosecution is filed. The department, through its officers, endeavors to conduct an educational campaign to further the interests of the egg industry and afford a means for greater financial returns to the producer. Since the enactment of the egg candling law, there has been a marked improvement in the quality of eggs marketed In Nebraska with a steady increase In prices paid to the producer, resulting in a greater consumption of eggs on account of the consumer being </seg>
            <seg id="p759">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION assured of a good, wholesome food when eggs are purchased. !,„.„ - ous warnings have been given to all dealers that they must comply with the egg candling law, but seemingly not realizing the importance of the purposes of the law, they appear defiant and learn their lesson by forcing a prosecution. , ' The price of eggs is regulated by the average quality of the eggs on the entire market. Every time inferior quality eggs find their way to the market through unscrupulous dealers, or otherwise, the average quality is lowered and reflects upon the prices which the produce, as a whole, commands. It is of great importance, then, that some method should be devised to encourage the production and marketing of a better grade egg. How can this be done if the pro - ducer of an extra good grade egg, marketed properly, must be pen - alized on acount of entrance on the market of poor quality eggs, and these marketed under the most adverse circumstances? There would seem to be only one answer and that is "Pay for what you get and get what you pay for." The first prerequisite appears to be the proper care of the eggs at the place of production, followed by an early delivery to the market. Second, a thorough and efficient candling of the eggs and the rejection of all inedible eggs and the separation of the cracks and checks from the sound eggs. These two precautions are effectual so far as they go but there is evidently something still lacking in order to produce the best results. What about grading eggs? Experience disclosed that if we would take a case of eggs 'as they came from the producer, and grade them, tbat frequently he would receive more actual cash on a case count basis than he would on a graded basis, but instruct that same pro - ducer how to care for his eggs at the place of production and how to market them and his next case of eggs will show a greater . return oh a graded basis than case count. Numerous egg grading stations have been established, which at first received very few Nebraska extras, but in a short time, one-third of the eggs delivered were top grade, and at this writing, we have many stations running as high as 90 to 95 per cent top grade. When we bear in mind that the Nebraska extra commands 4 to 5 cents per dozen more than case count eggs, it is not difficult to figure the vast amount of financial benefit accruing to the Nebraska farmers. Day by day, more producers are realizing the advantages of the grading system of marketing their eggs and are encouraging others to follow the same practice. Every time a producer or dealer adds his cooperation to the cause of improving the quality of Nebraska eggs, he increases the possibilities of the egg industry. There need be but little expenditure of time, effort and capital in order to obtain the desired results. Summing </seg>
            <seg id="p760">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE up the whole transaction In a few words, we may say: Have a good healthy flock, take the proper care of the produce, market to the best advantage, and comply with the laws, rules and regulations. Nebraska in one year produced 67,146,661 dozen eggs. We must recognize that egg production is an industry of no mean proportions, yet it is an industry that has received far too little attention from the marketing standpoint. There is on the statutes of Nebraska, a law known as the egg candling law, which, if- obeyed, would help to solve a great part of the problem. The attitude of many toward the law defeats its purpose. The- egg candling law should be amended so that definite responsibility could be placed on the proper person for the correct candling of the eggs. This law should provide for the licensing of egg candlers and dealers, and it should make possible MMWE|hp; * ''^'KjfffffBnBBHMMHiWMMMWBMli KiBiMWSSifflPfSnriiff ill 'Hi \ mli "I ' 'liiii iTiiMraBff EXHIBIT AT THE NEBRASKA STATE FAIR the establishment of grades for eggs. It is a gross injustice to pay the producer who delivers a case of the best eggs only the same price as we pay the man who sells a case of poor eggs. One reason the grading plan is difficult to put into effect is that we can not see with the naked eye the change that is taking place within the egg, and without that impression which we would gain through the sense of sight, the subject does not receive its due consideration. The law provides for the proper candling of all eggs bought for resale, consignment or storage. If this was done efficiently it would' prevent inedible eggs from entering the market. When we establish </seg>
            <seg id="p761">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION the 'fact and reputation that every egg purchased is a good eaiuie egg, our producers are going to receive a better value for the money they expend. Whenever we are certain of the value of a dozen eggs, the price paid, though higher, will be less than the price we pay for a dozen eggs of unknown value, plus the questionable quality we are getting. With a high reputation for quality of Nebraska eggs established, we can go onto the big markets and receive 5c to 10c more per dozen of them^ When we realize that 2c per dozen brings an additional one and one-third million dollars to our state, it is easy to calculate what 10c per dozen will bring. The answer is uni - formity in size and best quality. Eggs that come from the producer must be candled, not to question the producer's integrity and not to make more work, but to keep bad eggs off the market. The price we receive for eggs is only the value of the average quality of the eggs. A dozen of good eggs is only worth so much, and it we are compelled to buy eighteen eggs to get that dozen good ones, we are only going to pay the dozen price for the eighteen eggs. How neces - sary, then, it is that only good edible eggs should find their way to the market. I hear someone say: "It costs too much to candle eggs, and besides I have not the time." I believe that this statement, when applied to the average store, is almost true. I believe that most merchants would be far ahead if they allowed the produce market to buy all produce for cash and put the same time and energy into improving their methods of oppr - atlng their business, improving the quality of tlieir merchandise, and also their service, that -they spend in handling a small amount of produce. In attempting the operation of so many different depart - ments in a small way, we are apt to neglect the detail work that each department demands, and the result is too much lost motion. If we insist on buying eggs let us do it conscientiously, and in accordance with the law. After we have carefully candled the eggs brought in by the producers, how do we then dispose of them? If within forty-eight hours after you have candled them, as shown by the candling slip, a purchaser comes in you are permitted to sell him those eggs without candling provided he withholds one dollar per case in order that any loss may be adjusted. This purchaser (whom I am presuming is operating a produce truck) then takes them to the large buyer who candles these eggs and pays the truckman only for good eggs. The truckman then returns to the merchant and pays such part, or all of the dollar to him that is due. This method has been adopted in order to hasten the movement of the eggs and to subject them to less handling before they* reach the consumer or storage warehouse. Handling eggs, especially in warm weather, does not im - prove their quality.' When the truckman receives these eggs at the </seg>
            <seg id="p762">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE store there may be some eggs that will pass the test, but by the time they reach the consumer or storage plant, they may have spoiled on account of the heat and jolting. It would seem that this loss must be borne by the merchant. If, however, he does not wish to stand this loss he is wholly within his rights to demand candling at the time and place of sale. It is one more of those difficult problems, that the merchant must combat and it is a loss that cannot be deter - mined before it occurs. Here let me repeat: We are attempting to improve the quality by keeping inedible eggs off the market. If we could all get together and say: "Sell the produce to produce dealers," I think everyone would be benefited. I have no quarrel with anyone engaging in the produce business irrespective of what other business they may have, provided they will. give the produce business the time and attention it demands. I do object to the produce business being used, like a football,' kicked at random over the field. Too often when eggs are purchased and only the good ones paid for, they are stored in a room, which is warm, and I have, even seen them stacked up by the stove or radiator, or where the sun shines directly on them, and the temperature gets so high that the fertile eggs would be liable to hatch, and yet the dealer wonders why he has such a great loss when he gets the returns from the market. The produce business is one that demands special attention, and eggs especially, because the edible part is concealed and we cannot see, under ordinary circumstances, what we are getting. Eggs must be handled under favorable conditions or someone is going to take a big loss. Candle all eggs carefully, rejecting the bad ones, and I will go' farther and say: grade eggs according to standards now set up and the producer will be better paid, the egg buyer can make a better margin of profit and have the satisfaction of selling a good wholesale edible food, and the consumer will get a better value for the money he expends. COMPETITION IN THE EGG INDUSTRY — HOW SHALL. WE MEET IT? By ARTHUR W. MEDLAR Dept. of Rural Economics, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr. Competition may be definoC as "the effort of two or more sellers to sell to the same person or persons, each seller acting Independently in his own interests without regard to the interests of the other sellers." This doubtless means that the sellers may be trying to sell the same kind of product to the same person or persons, or it may mean that the sellers are trying to sell a product which may be sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p763">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION ■ stituted fur the given product by the consumer. In the egg industry it means that our competitors in the market consist of two classes of producers. The one group comprises the producers of eggs. The other group comprises producers who have a product which may be used instead of eggs. It is impossible to locate all of this latter group. They live in our own land and in foreign lands. They offer "meats, fruits, vegetables and chemical compounds which contain vitamins and other necessities for a proper diet. They offer recipes for foods which require only one egg instead of two or perhaps no eggs at all. In a hundred ways they feed us about as well as formerly and yet reduce the number of eggs required in the consumer's diet. This group of competitors is difficult to handle. By advertising they create a desire for a new food. By salesmanship they make us want to try to reduce our living expenses. By psychological means they turn us from the pro - ducts which we grow to those made from other products or brought in from other lands. Probably the wisest way to deal with this class of competitors is to meet them on their own ground. Do they advertise the excellence of their goods? Let the poultryman tell the consumer the real value of eggs in the diet and in the health. Do they go into the laboratory and discover how to use more of their product and less of egg? The poultryman must do likewise. Let him find how to make a better food through the use of more eggs and less of other foods. Let the consumer be satisfied that by the use of eggs he does get more satisfaction and value for his money than he could get by the purchase of any other food. It has been said that the stomachs of the world can be satisfied with a certain amount of food. It is the job of the poultryman to see that eggs constitute the largest possible per cent of this bulk. Let ? the work be done scientifically, economically, honestly, appetizingly and profitably. It may be accomplished through advertising, through research in- the food laboratory, through the health clinic, through education, through maintenance of uniform quality of. eggs, through ! proper distribution and display and in a dozen or more other ways. . The poultryman must meet his competitor in all these fields and prove I to the consumer that eggs are really better for him than any or perhaps all of the substitutes offered by competitors. It is no easy task to ' meet this class of competitors and perhaps it is not desirable to elim - inate them entirely. But if the poultryman wants the consumer to continue to use eggs, he must be alert and not allow substitutes in the diet to crowd eggs from the consumer's table. The class of competitors which more directly annoy the Nebraska egg producer is the group who try to sell eggs to the same person or persons as the Nebraska producer tries to sell to. These com - petitors may be roughly divided into two or three groups. First is the </seg>
            <seg id="p764">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE competitor from foreign lands. We complain against him largely be - cause he is a foreigner. The second class comprises those in areas within the United States where eggs are produced in quantities above the local need. They enter markets which the Nebraska producer once supplied or those markets which logically belong to him. or those markets which the Nebraska producer could supply — if it were not for an unusually strong competitor. The third group includes the marginal producers of eggs in Nebraska and in the other surplus egg areas. Perhaps you would like to exclude them since they are irregular producers, or producers of a low quality product, or even because the total amount of their product is relatively small. Of one thing we may be certain — if the marginal producer in Nebraska ana all other egg surplus areas could be eliminated, competition in the egg market would be greatly relieved. Perhaps it will be best to consider the problems involved in these three groups separately. First then, will come the foreign egg pro - ducer. The Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture shows that in 1913 foreign countries were shipping Into our markets 1,348,000 dozen eggs and 228,000 pounds of -dried or frozen eggs. The eggs in shell have gradually decreased until in 1929, we imported only 291,000 dozen eggs — and 254,000 dozen of these came from Hong Kong and China — or about one-fifth as many as in 1913. The imports, of dried, frozen, preserved and otherwise prepared eggs have greatly increased since 1913. In 1921 we imported 14,830,000 pounds of this class of eggs but by 1929 it had 'more than doubled, reaching a total of 32,549,000 pounds. China furnished about 86 per cent of these eggs. An interesting comparison for the Nebraska producer to make is to change the dried. eggs to dozens by allowing four-tenths of a pound of dried eggs per dozen of whole eggs. The results would be a total of 81,663,000 dozen imported eggs — Nebraska's annual pro - duction may be conservatively estimated from 67,000,000 to 72,000,000 dozen. The Nebraska producer's problem Is first to determine whether the eggs in shell and the dried or prepared eggs are really competitors in the marketing of his eggs. Eggs in shell from China are of low quality but in so far as they crowd out the Nebraska egg from the market, they are competitors. Next, what can be done about it? Wheeler MacMillan in his book "Too Many Farmers" suggests that (Tried, preserved and prepared eggs from China are* not used for the same purpose that American eggs are and therefore, should not be considered as being in competition with our eggs. This may be true, but it is certain that most of our producers would like to see them excluded from the markets. To accomplish this, we have erected a tariff wall of ten cents per dozen on eggs in shell, thirty-six cents per pound on whole dried eggs, sixty cents per pound on dried albumen and thirty cents per pound on dried yolks. Whether this is the best or final solution for the elimination of our foreign competitors will </seg>
            <seg id="p765">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION remain an open question so long as the tariff remains a political foot - ball. Economists are inclined to favor free trade, division of labor, and fair competition. They would, therefore, suggest as a better remedy than the tariff a reduction of production costs so that the foreign competitor would be unable to compete with us in our home markets. - The next competitor is the poultrymen in other egg surplus areas. Outstanding among these states are the two Dakotas, Kansas, Iowa Missouri, California, Washington, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Statis - tics are given for the six leading egg markets in the United States showing the state of origin of eggs shipped to each of these six markets. The two western markets. San Francisco and Los Angeles received practically all of their eggs from five states, namely, Cali - fornia, Oregon, Washington. Idaho and Utah. In fact, all other states together contributed less than one-half of one per cent of eggs received at San Francisco any year from 1922 to 1929 inclusive and no morb than three per cent of the. eggs received at the Los Angeles market during these same years. In the western market then, the NebrasKa poultryman is not a competitor with other surplus egg states. On the Boston market for 1929, five states sold more eggs than Nebraska. These were, in order, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. On the Chicago market, Nebraska ranked sixth, being ' surpassed by Iowa, Winneota, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Dakota. On the New York market for the Bame year Nebraska ranked thirteenth. Washington, California. New York and Tennessee joined the central states to com - pete with Nebraska In the sale of eggs to New York consumers. Should these two western states logically market' eggs in New York? They enter this market at certain seasons and with eggs of high quality. Their competition with Nebraska eggs partakes of the nature of the marginal producer. When fresh Corn Belt eggs are scarce— October to December — western eggs reach the New York market in large quantities, the volume often being from forty to fifty per cent of the receipts on the New York market during these months. Through - out the period of our heaviest production — March to July — western eggs constitute only a small per cent of the eggs arriving in New York. There is a great deal of discussion about the competition of Pacific coast eggs but after all. it really is not so serious as the competition of marginal producers in the Corn Belt states. In the Philadelphia market, Nebraska ranked fifteenth, but none of the far western states were among the close competitors. Taking the question "by and large then, our serious competitors in the large eastern markets are Uie states of the Corn Belt. They are states with production much the same as Nebraska, the only difference being the amount of different products grown. Before going into the question of how to meet this competition it will be well to discuss briefly the marginal producer of eggs. This </seg>
            <seg id="p766">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE gruuy comprises a large array of producers. Some produce a few eggs as a side-line — it makes little difference to them what the price of eggs may be. If the price is high, they will sell all they have — if the price is low, they will eat them all. Some marginal producers have many eggs for sale but their cost of production is so great that only during the high price period is there any profit left them. When prices are low they become discouraged and drop out of the game but there are always new ones to take their places. At first though, this class of producers may seem Insignificant but In reality they furnish the regular poultryman much of his stiffest competition. We might remove some of them by showing them that their costs of pro - duction were greater than the market price. We might eliminate some of them through regulation of the quality .of eggs which may be offered for sale. But when we have done our best, the class of marginal producers will probably continue to sell eggs enough to jeopardize the profits of efficient producers. Now how may we best meet the competition of good poultry men in the Corn Belt states? These are the poultry men who put the largest volume of eggs on the market in direct competition with ours. Their eggs are produced during the same period as ours. Their eggs are of the same quality as ours and their customers are the same as ours. Among the remedies which may be available are the following: 1. Concentrating on volume in the hands of fewer handlers. This may Involve a cooperative marketing association or a corporation which extends over enough territory that it may secure a large volume of eggs. One of the functions of this organization would be to educate producers. They should be instructed In practical ways of breeding, feeding, culling, selecting eggs for market, — anything which will make the grading and distribution of eggs an earlier job for the organization. 2. Reduction in costs of production.' It is true in the- field of unrestricted competition that the producer with the least cost has an advantage in the market. The law of competitive prices bars any entrepreneur from setting a price which he must have for his product. However, cost, of production, in the long run, sets both the maximum and minimum price at which producers will offer eggs. This means that poultrymen with the lowest production costs will be offering eggs to the consumers in the market after his competitors are forced out. One economic truth in cost of production stands out like a thorn and snags many a poultryman who does not think his problem through carefully. "Past costs of production are not the important costs" — eggs once produced must sell under the law of supply and demand. Prices are not fixed by production costs o? goods now existing. Too many times the poultryman believes that he will be able to command twenty-five or thirty cents per dozen for his eggs because it is now costing him that much. But other producers may be securing their eggs at a less cost and they will continue to offer eggs. It is the low </seg>

Nebraska poultryme.. „», continue profitable egg production and drive out some other Corn Belt producers only If they are able to keep their costs of production under those of their competitors. 3. A careful study of economic conditions affecting the con - sumer of eggs. This is the other half of the shears which economists .talk so much about. It is the demand side of the question. Consum - ers will want eggs so long as eggs are appetizing and industry pays good wages. The egg producer should watch the trend of employment and wages; he should watch the price of rent and clothing; he should know the purchasing power of the consumer in the city. If the Ne - braska egg producer knows these things he will be enabled to keep the proper volume of eggs moving toward the market. 4. A study of the cycles of egg production. Thoughtful poultry - men recognize that the "Cure for low prices is low prices and the cure for high prices is high prices." This statement means that when eggs are low, many poultrymen recognize that they are losing money and drop out of the game, then the low supply of eggs with the same demand raises the egg prices. When egg prices are high more and more eggs are offered on the market until prices break. The law of supply and demand continues to operate and low prices result. Stu - dents, of egg prices have found that this movement occurs quite reg - ularly every four years. One of the best ways for Nebraska egg pro - ducers to meet the competition of other Corn Belt producers is to regulate their production of eggs so that when they are near the high or low point of the cycle, the flow of eggs will more nearly meet the demand of the consumer. By this regulation prices may be maintained more nearly at the Nebraska producer's cost of production — granting, of course, that this cost of production is lower than that of the com - petitor. 5. Making contacts with the consumer. Consumers are Just like all other people. They like to meet the man with whom they deal. Individual egg producers can not deal with Individual egg consumers. This must be done through the middlemen, the men who buy, store and sell the eggs. The egg producers can watch the market road of his eggs and see what can be done to keep the consumers wanting eggs. • If buyers are careless it may require the work of a specialist to help keep the eggs attractive and of a high quality while passing through the buyers hands. If merchants fail to display eggs of uni - form shape, color and quality, the producer may have to hire some specialist to enter this field and make favorable contact with the con - sumer. Perhaps Nebraska producers could sell more Nebraska eggs if they had someone making these contacts with consumers. Informa - tion about eggs and consumers must be gathered and published. This may be an added cost of production but it may lower the total cost of </seg>
            <seg id="p768">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE production to the producer. It may require an extensive advertising campaign to keep eggs in the mind of consumers. If it does, the producer had better recognize the fact before- his business strikes the rocks. In other fields producers are working every avenue to the consumer. Nebraska egg producers might do well to study their methods and select those methods applicable to their business. These are a few of the outstanding problems and some remedies for each of them. The field merits further study. The Nebraska pro - ducer must know and follow the fundamental economic laws in the problem. He must not trust to legal barriers or false organization to 'long thwart the ruthless laws of economics. His safest plan is to make Nebraska the area of low cost of production of quality eggs. He may then depend upon the consumer to want his eggs. MY EXPERIENCE WITH TCKKEYS IN 1980- By H. F. KOERWITZ, Deshler, Nebr. The turkey season of 1030, although not a very profitable season, I could call it a banner year as far as experience is concerned. I had a very good experience in the way of handling a turkey ring in many ways. The way of handling the eggs for the folks in the ring was not the best but it worked out fairly well just the same. All the eggs from the different flocks were brought into my hatchery and a record was kept of each member's eggs that had accumulated during a week's time. The eggs were exchanged among the different flock owners and if one flock owner did not have enough eggs for his setting he would buy them from someone that had a larger flock at an agreement price of twe"nty cents per egg. This exchanging of eggs was done free gratis on my part, only that I got the privilege of hatching the eggs for all the people in the ring. The price for hatching was five cents per egg and a two per cent commission was allowed me for the handling of the eggs that were shipped out. The price we got for hatching eggs was thirty cents per egg. The eggs were hatched in my large Buckeye machine and the average percentage of hatches run between fifty-five and sixty per cent, which of course was not very good. The moisture problem seemed to be the greatest trouble that I experienced this year. I found that running my machine at a wet bulb reading of eighty degrees and then adding moisture by sprinkling the eggs at hatching time seemed to give me the best results. The heat temperature was the same as for my hen eggs, ninety-nine and one-half degrees. The poults all were nice big husky fellows with the exception of a few spraddle legged. </seg>
            <seg id="p769">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION I believe I would be safe in saying that the loss from disease was only ten per cent, but the mortality from smothering would be fifteen per cent or better. All the birds were fed and raised in con - finement and seemed to have grown very nicely. These blrdB were fed the rations that the College of Agriculture used during the season of 1929. The marketing plan was not of a very good way of getting the top price but it seemed that the flock owners were fairly well pleased with the price that they got which was only twenty cents per pound delivered to Beatrice live weight for No. 1 grade. Fortunately about ninety-five per cent of the birds graded as No. 1 stock, which 1 con - sider pretty good. The later birds were sold for eighteen cents per pound for the Christmas trade. We had seven flock owners and with the exception of two they all kept the same amount of hens as they had the previous year. This, of course, goes to show that Thayer county will have a nice flock of turkeys for the coming season of 1931. TURKEY PROSPECTS FOR 1931 By MRS. J. J. DONAHUE, Inland, Nebr. With the beginning of the new year, it is well not only to look ahead and plan for the future, but it is equally wise to look back over the season just passed -to note our measures of success in our various enterprises, and then base our plans for the future on our experiences of the past. How has our turkey business fared, this past y.ear? If our busi - ness has been a success, by just what particular methods did we achieve that success when so many have decided there is nothing in turkey production and have gone out of the business. What were the sources of failure for those who are quitting? In looking over the field of turkey production from my viewpoint, I will try to answer these questions; first, by taking back a statement I made a year ago. I think I said at that time, that our production problems were solved. I feel obliged to contradict myself. Our Ne - braska method of turkey production is right, absolutely, but the prac - tical application of the 3C system of poultry management is too often neglected entirely or half-heartedly done. Chickens and young turkeys must be kept separate with the poults on clean ground. In the neglect of this precaution lies the failure of many. These producers must learn that this principle Is neither a fad nor a fiction but an absolutely honest deduction drawn from the findings of the Agricultural College, and from work done by careful cooperatbrs out over the state. While mature turkeys may offer considerable resistance to the hazards of </seg>
            <seg id="p770">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE companionship of chickens, immature turkeys or poults will almost invariably pay the death penalty for such association. If they do escape, they are apt to carry effects within them In the way of chronic blackhead, worm infestation, roup, .tuberculosis. Grief in these matters has driven some producers out of the business. A buyer told me before Thanksgiving of his purchase of a whole flock of turkeys for 12c per pound. These' turkeys proved to be afflicted with roup, and the buyer lost money even at that price. Another flock disappointed its owner by becoming so worm infested that the birds failed to put on proper market finish. Blackhead has driven out a few flocks of which I have personal knowledge. The marketing of such inferior birds helps greatly to demoralize our markets, and not only that, but the consumer's appetite for turkeys is not whetted any by the sight of a blackhead liver or by the gaunt carcass of a turkey from which round worms and tape worms have taken their toll of flesh. Sanitation must be maintained. Healthy turkeys, fed properly for market finish will keep the industry going with profit to the pro - ducer and satisfaction to the consumer. The clean turkey, properly fed for finish, and carefully, pains - takingly dressed is still in demand and commands a quality price. The production of this kind of turkey insures both profit and pleasure. Those who have made a success this year are those who have produced quality turkeys and who have taken the trouble to locate their own definite markets. The small producer and especially the one who has had trouble in his flock is usually the haphazard salesman. Cooperative turkey marketing pool are possible only where healthy turkeys, well finished and in sufficient numbers are raised. Webster county furnishes a shining example of. what quality of product and orderly marketing will do. Turkey Industry in that county is r _ a success. In my own experience, I find each year a growing satisfaction from my work with my turkey flock. The following brief history will reveal the source of that satisfaction.

Fifty-seven birds. $535.16 divided by 57 equals $9.38 labor wage on each breeder. What Are the Prospects for 1031? With the small producers dropping out of sight there may not be much demand for hatching eggs. The larger producers will main - tain large enough breeding flocks to supply themselves. There is every chance that only better quality market birds will be produced another year. More pools probably,, successfully operating will help the price. It will be well for us to raise only what we can finish properly and market profitably. We are where we can control production and should do this. There is much labor and close attention to details .attendant on turkey production, and the industry has not yet reached, the point where the product can be classed other than as a luxury. I look forward to 1931 with lively anticipation of a prosperous, profit - able turkey year. </seg>
