TKe Board was called to order by Vice President A. J. Weaver, due to inability of President T. H. Wake to be present at this meeting. CHAIRMAN WEAVER: The annual meeting of the State Board - of Agriculture is now in session. In the absence of the President who, very much to his regret as well as to ours, is unavoidably detained to - day, I am assuming to preside over this body as first Vice President, I have been a member of this Board for seven years. I know that I appreciate with you the importance . of this organization to this State. 1 had the pleasure this morning of sitting in with the meeting of the Gounty Fair Associations of Nebraska. I want to express on behalf of the State Board of Agriculture our appreciation of the splendid work that organization is doing. Nebraska is just in its infancy. I think you men who are engaged in this important work in behalf of agriculture and in behalf of building up the State realize the im - portance of such organizations as the County Fair Association and the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. The Secretary will read the call to this meeting. . </seg>

            <seg id="p016">REl'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS The Nebraska State Fair for the year 1927 was a great satisfac - tion to all. It is fast becoming what the supporters have always maintained it to be, a great educational institution. The unbearable heat kept many from the bleachers all during the week and no doubt lost us several hundred dollars, but the Secretary's report will show the exhibits and attendance were the greatest in the history of the Fair. This is a progressive age and the immense crowds that swarmed around the exhibits seemed to be there to gain information. It is not enough to know and see the prize winner but they must have the desired information of how it was made or produced. Agriculture is Nebraska's greatest resource. The progress of agriculture is the hope of the world. The advancement and improve - ment of its every branch is the permanent success of Nebraska. We must stand up for our greatest industry or we reflect discredit upon our state, realizing that if we succeed permanently we must have pros - perity on the farms. It is a well known fact that a prosperous people on the land strengthens the entire fabric of the national life and especially so in Nebraska. Unless the farm people of Nebraska are productive and prosperous the state cannot permanently prosper. It makes no difference what your vocation in life may be, the Ne* braska State Fair stands out as the one institution of learning that will meet the demand of all. The patrons of the Pair have come to realize that this annual exposition has much to offer and that it is not for farmers alone. In fact in some respects merchants profit more by attending the Fair than any other group. The time has come when the merchants must understand their customers' business and the most of their customers are farmers. The merchant who is inclined to ask the question, what will it profit me to spend time, money and effort at the Nebraska State Fair, should stop and think and I am sure we will all agree that if he becomes prosperous his customers must be prosperous also. The same will apply to Fairs. A prosperous agricul - ture not only developed the institution but developed its operation. It is an institution of inspiration and we gather inspiration from each other. It is at this annual exhibition that we can look upon the best and practical things that have been produced by years of experiment - ins: and scientific study and research that will interest any student, old or young, that cares to be interested. We are all proud of Nebraska and her achievements, what we need is a little real publicity about the greatness of her agricultural re- </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE sources and financial strength. Just plain facts about Nebraska will give her a record that will be a part in national history, a record that will be a guide to generations to come; a record that will be read and re-read With pride by our children and their children after you who l-epresent then- interests today are laid away. The most perplexing problem for the Board to solve is how to take care of the exhibits. Another matter that requires the organized thought of the Board of Managers is how to function with such a growing institution and expense on a. fifty cent gate admission. The Boys and Girls Club Work is developing so fast that we find it im - possible to find room for their exhibits. Twelve years ago thov re - quired ten feet of space with $8.00 -expense, the 1927 exhibit required 80,000 square feet of exhibit space and an expense of £3,026 00 Who Ai. g r! t0 "* that thG B ° yS and Girls aul » Work is n &lt;* worth while' All that is necessary to -make the Nebraska Boys and Girls Club ex - hibit the greatest of any sfate in the union is a new building to exhibit in and again we have a wonderful opportunity to develop the bun°dtg were possib | e for us t0 take care of !t in a smtable . It might be well for the citizens of Nebraska, or their represen - tatives to meet conditions as they are and look this matter squarely &gt;n 1* f aC e. i the Nebraska gtate Fair . g while doing well. If it is to function and keep up with Nebraska's progress it must have buildings to exhibit the wonderful additional exhibits in and it is an impossibility for the Association to build permanent buildings w ith a fifty cent gate admission, the same as it uas in the territorial days. The additional demands made on the As - soc, a t,on for greater activities, more classes and higher premiums, absorb our rece.pts and a great deal more at times. It is not asking too much, I am sure, to be placed in the same class and receive equal financial support by the state through legislative appropriation that adjoining states are getting from th°ir le*;slature S . VICE PRESIDENT WEAVER: The next order of business is the report of the Secretary. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">l:EPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY FOR 1927 Nebraska's fifty-ninth annual fair has gone into history. It was the greatest success in attendance, in general interest, of any previous fair and exemplified most thoroughly its grand mission as an object les.se .1 school of the highest grade. The Nebraska State Fair has grown to such magnitude that we may expect it to continue to grow of its own weight. The fair is gaining an enviable record and stands as follows: first in state per capita at - tendance, first in daily attendance of any six-day fjiir charging admis - sion, and third in daily attendance of all fairs for 1927. But as we start to lay plans for the 1928 fair we realize that the larger the fair becomes the more opportunity we have and the greater are the responsibilities. We made the statement last year that Nebraska's greatest fair had not been held. So we can truthfully say now, that Nebraska's greatest fair has not yet been held. We were blessed with a bountiful harvest from the Missouri Valley to the Colorado and Wyoming border and the state wide farming in - terests were never more satisfactory than for the year just closed. The early season in some respects was discouraging. The cold, wet weather held the corn planting back and made it late in germinating. In many sections of the state it was necessary to replant after the unfavorable weather and cut worms almost ruined the stand. It was feared that the late planting would be caught by an ordinarily early frost, but after a growing season of 191 days, unusual warm weather continued and the ripening period was beyond precedence; with the . result that the whole corn crop, with the exception of the extreme . western part of the state, was cribbed in excellent condition, thus placing Nebraska second among the states in production of corn, amounting to 291,000,000 bushels. Nebraska was also second only to the record year, with 298,600,000 bushels in 1896. Thirty-three states of the union were represented, as well as the District of Columbia, at the 1927 Nebraska State Fair. Iowa, as might naturally be supposed, led the other states with 956 cars. Kansas fol - lowed with 356, Missouri came next with 226, Illinois with 102 and ■ other states in their order were California 79; Colorado 57; South Dakota 57; Oklahoma 56; Wyoming 43; Texas 31; Minnes6ta 25; Florida 23; Indiana 15; Michigan 15; Oregon 10; Wisconsin 10; New York 9; Virginia 8; Louisiana 7; Pennsylvania 7; New Jersey 5; Ar - kansas 5; Washington 4; Idaho 4; Ohio 3; Massachusetts, Kentucky and Arizona 2 each; and Georgia, Maryland, North Dakota, Tennessee and District of Columbia 1 each. There were 2,134 foreign cars in all. Favorable weather and our Nebraska good roads brought 33,088 Nebras-ka cars from 91 counties as follows: </seg>

            <seg id="p020">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE HORSES AND MULES The draft horse exhibit was much larger than the year before. There were 313 entries compared with 264 last year. Nearly all the breeds were represented. Two exhibitors from Iowa had twenty-three entries of Clydes and Shires that won $664.00 in premiums. Thirty- j four entries of Percherons from Kansas won $567.95 and one ex - hibitor from Oklahoma won $229.95, while seventeen exhibitors from I Nebraska won $1,760.00 in premiums. There seemed to be a great deal I of interest in this department, large crowds assembling around the show ring while the judging was being done. BEEF BREEDS OF CATTLE Our beef breeds of cattle on exhibition were not all we would like. With a cattle barn second to none of any state in the union we should have one of the Kieatest cattle exhibits in the United States. The Minnesota State Fair is held on the same dates as ours, but I find that exhibitors, everything: being equal, would much rather come to i Nebraska on account of our southern circuit, but in consulting the ' various premium lists we find that our premiums are at least fifty per cent lower than at other fairs in the corn belt. For instance, j while Nebraska is offering premiums amounting to $12,800.00, Iowa I is offering $35,715.00, Illinois $35,097.00, Minnesota 28,240,00, Mis- I souri $24,915.00, Oklahoma $9,761.00, Kansas State Fair $11,437.00 and the Kansas Free Fair $8,210.00. In other words, Nebraska is fifth in the amount of premiums offered in comparison with the eight states listed. While Nebraska is paying for first prize bulls $115.00, divided into eleven premiums, other states are paying as fol- ' lows: Iowa $320.00 divided into ten prizes, Illinois $242.00 divided into ten prizes, Minnesota $162.00 divided into nine prizes, Oklahoma ; $145.00 divided into six prizes, Missouri $135.00 divided into six prizes, ! Kansas State Fair $88.0 ! 0 divided into six prizes, Kansas Free Fair | $100.00 divided into six prizes. Nebraska pays $20.00 for champion animal while Iowa pays $75.00, Illinois $40.00, Missouri $35.00, Min- ;. nesota $20.00, Oklahoma $20.00, Kansas State Fair $20.00 and Kansas* | Free Fair $25.00. In the aged herd Nebraska pays $100.00 divided I into five premiums, Iowa $400.00 divided into ten premiums, Illinois •'.' $230.00 divided into six premiums, Minnesota $177.00 divided into six premiums, Missouri $115.00 divided into five premiums, Oklahoma $80.00 divided into four premiums, Kansas State Fair $115.00 divided ] h into five premiums and the Kansas Free Fair $115.00 divided into four premiums. </seg>

A great deal of in - terest was shown by the visitors and they were especially well pleased with the cordiality of the attendants and their willingness to answer questions and explain the outstanding qualities of the different breeds. This is one of the prime essentials for a successful fair. People who do not know come to find out. The blue ribbon on the coop is not enough, they want to know how and why. Almost every breed of chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese were there and seemed to be glad of it, and why not? Statistics will show they add from thirty-two to thirty-five million dollars annually to the state's wealth. They have a right to crow. RABBIT SHOW The State Rabbit Association made a very creditable show: While there were probably not as many rabbits as some other year it created quite an interest. So far we have been able to take care of this exhibit in the poultry building. There was one exhibitor in fur-bearing animals. In this connec - tion may I suggest that the culture of fur-bearing animals is becom - ing a growing industry in Nebraska? In harmony with the funda - mental educational ideas of the State Fair it might be well to en - courage this, new industry to make exhibits by offering appropriate prizes. AGRICULTURAL EXHIBIT The Agricultural Hall seemed to be a meeting place where throngs of people would sit on the balcony and watch the masses mill through and enjoy the wonderful agricultural exhibits. There were twenty-six county agricultural exhibits, an increase of over twenty-five per cent. It was necessary to add over 200 lineal feet on the outside and under the balcony to accommodate the increased exhibit. Although corn was not sufficiently matured in some of the counties, the showing was most encouraging. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">REl'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HORTICULTURAL EXHIBIT One thing about the horticultural exhibit is the fact that invariably they initiate something new that catches the eyes of the visitors in the Agricultural and Horticultural Hall. We had 690 entries in this department. Of this number 300 were in plants and flowers, 195 apple entries and balance in green fruits, pears, plums, grapes, etc. We offered $1,906.00 in prizes and paid $1,337.75. DOMESTIC PRODUCTS The Domestic Products exhibit on the balcony of the Agricultural Hall draws a great deal of attention. There were 1,817 entries of bread and cake, canned fruits and vegetables, preserved fruits, con-, serve, butters, jams, jellies, pickles, canned meat and other miscel - laneous exhibits. Ninety-one per cent of the premiums offered were paid, amounting to $441.25. THE HONEY EXHIBIT ■ The Honey Exhibit fits in nicely with the Domestic Products and sets off the northwest corner of the balcony of the Agricultural Hall as no other exhibit can do. There was white honey, yellow honey, amber honey and brown honey in the stacks of shining glasses and bottles. Color of honey is due to the plants from which the bees . obtain "their nectar. This is a wonderful exhibit for those interested iti bees. TEXTILE DEPARTMENT The textile department attracted hosts of admiring women. Pass this department when you may, you will find throngs of people, both old and young, commenting upon the beautiful quilts, pillows and other • pieces of fancy work. There were 1,763 entries made, winning $647.25 in prizes. FINE ARTS . Nebraska has artists as well as stock raisers. The paintings were greater in number and more artistic than ever before. All space was i taxed to capacity and then it was not enough. The work of Nebraska artists predominated. 1,393 entries were made, winning $709.00 in prizes. THE SCHOOL EXHIBIT The thoughtful visitor could not but be impressed on seeing the south side of the balcony of the Agricultural Hall, with the infinite amount of work done by the little hands that had produced the pains- I taking displays of class work, particularly in the rural schools. County </seg>
            <seg id="p024">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OP AGRICULTURE superintendents and teachers are to be commended for directing the preparation, the selecting, shipping and displaying of the maps, the writings, art work and myriad attractive articles. Too much can not be said for the clever pieces of utilitarian furniture made by the boys of the rural and village schools. AND THE SPELLENG CONTEST This, was the second year for the state spelling contest. There were sixty-one contestants representing thirty-one counties. This spelling contest is carried on in a graduated system; the best spellers from the rural schools, village, town and city schools of each county compete at the county contest and the best from the county is selected to come and reach their final climax at the Nebraska State Fair. It can be readily seen that it is not only beneficial to those reaching their climax at the Nebraska State Fair but a wonderful improvement is being made in the schools as well. HIGH SCHOOL BAND CONTEST The High School Band Contest was not up to our expectations. Seventeen bands entered during the summer months, but at the final only seven appeared. We feel, however, it is worth encouraging and by making a few changes in the rules to govern and arranging for three classes instead of two, we can build it up to be one of the in - teresting departments. BOYS' AND GIRLS' CLUB WORK Once again we must recognize the importance of our junior state fair, the boys' and girls' club activities. If the 9,136 boys and girls . who were in clubs last year in Nebraska, and their families, came to the fair on one day, we would have an average State Fair crowd with- .j out anyone else on the grounds. Both town and country people are interested in what the young people are doing, and we can always figure on the club exhibits and activities as one of the most import - ant features of the fair. The balcony built around the walls of the south part of the old ffc club building furnished a partial and temporary relief for the over - crowded condition of the club building, made it possible to stage the demonstrations upstairs, and also have all the home economics ex - hibits upstairs in a much better place than has been provided before. However, a few more baby beeves this year than last and an increase of 200 per cent in the dairy calf entries took up the entire space in the north part of the building and made it necessary to jam the poultry and crops exhibits together with the -various extension and U. S. Department of Agriculture booth exhibits in the south end of ;J the building. M </seg>
            <seg id="p025">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE As before, the swine entries were sheltered in tents and no really adequate provisions could be made for the proper exhibiting of the pigs.- The Koys were almost two days finishing a show that might have been completed in half the time in a good show ring. The de - layed judging received very little newspaper attention because awards were not ready at the time when the papers were interested in them. A 50 by 120 foot tent was raised south of the club building and used throughout the week. The dairy calf show was held there Mon - day, the auction sale of baby beeves Tuesday afternoon, the showing contests and the girls' style show on Wednesday, the big club gather - ing Wednesday evening and some demonstrations on Thursday and Friday. On practically all occasions more people were present than could be handled in this tent. "Doc," the grand charnpbn baby beef, brought 47% cents per • pound, a new record price for Nebraska State Fair sales. The 75 ribbon winners averaged 17 cents per pound and the entire offering nearly 15 cents per pound. Both buyers and sellers seemed well -pleased with the management of the sale. The two Lincoln dailies co-operated in putting out special pages each. day of the week for the club boys and girls. Officals of the ' agricultural extension service prepared the copy and took the pictures of winners for them, and also co-operated with the state fair press • bureau in furnishing copy to the other papers on the grounds. Forty- I- three per cent of the space devoted to &lt;;he state fair in the two Lin - coln dailies during the week was filled with club news and 28 of the 32 state fair pictures printed during the week were club pictures. At the end of the week each paper had a few constructive criticisms to make of the first attempt atj printing special pages, but each paper seemed well pleased with the results. Accurate count kept at various times during the past fair showed that the state fair crowds were coming into the boys' and girls' club building through the two main doors at the rate of 3,000 per hour at the busiest hours and 2,000 per hour for the other hours each day. The count was taken at only the two large doors. The building has five smaller doors and all of them were open all the time. This crowd, among the over-crowded exhibits in the first place, made the . . building a beehive and probably the most crowded place on the grounds. BABY CONTEST • No department on the Nebraska State Fair ground was making a greater bid for popularity for the entire week than the headquarters of the Baby Health Contest in the women's building. With its spaci- </seg>
            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF XKFTKAHKA STATK BOAKU OF AGRICULTURE ous verandas, comfortable rest rooms, adjoining playground and t nursery for the kiddies, it became a happy resting place for visitors of all ages. Two hundred twenty-five babies were entered in the Baby Health Contest ranging in age from 18 months to 36 months. Situated on the first floor of the building are lounging rooms, a rest room for mothers with tiny infants, and the emergency hospital. The hospital has on its staff qualified doctors and trained nurses. Six hundred thirty-four minor cases were handled during the week in the hospital. A kindernook is located in the shady foreground of the structure. There sand piles, tables, benches and child's water foun - tain invite the little tots to play while the parents may watch from surrounding veranda. The play ground for older children, equipped with swings, slides and other accommodations, was a favorite resort. The children are given free use of the playground for two hours at a time, which is open from nine in the morning until six o'clock in :he evening, with a special playground director and campfire girls, as assistants. A feature of the Women's Building, especially appreciated by mothers, is the nursery on the upper floor in charge of a registered nurse. This department is equipped with little white cribs where babies may be left and rest contentedly while their parents see the sights of. the fair grounds. No fee is charged for the allotted time of two hours. An ice box keeps the milk and food for the children cool and they are fed by the nu scs as the parents request. SHETLAND PONY RIDE It would be a tame affair for the kiddies if there were no Shet - land ponies at the Fair. The pony ride did quite a business. Nearly 7,545 children had a three-minute ride at ten cents each. GOAT DRIVE The Goat Drive was well attended by the little tots, going from the Shetland pony ride to the Goat drive, without any accidents, as far as we know. THE MINIATURE RAILROAD The Miniature Railroad was loqated north of the swine barn. The train was usually loaded to capacity and whistling all day. Those who operated the attraction were well pleased and have arranged for a return date. . , </seg>
            <seg id="p027">I REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE DOG SHOW The dogs barked both early and late for three days and nights. While none were of bad or dangerous disposition, many of them were nervous and fretful on account of the heat. The entries were un - usually complete as to classes and many of the individuals were among the best in the country. The Nebraska Kennel Club had charge of the show for three very successful days. CAT SHOW The second cat show was held the entire week. They were more contented than the dogs, they seemed to realize that they must be on their good behavior, they slept, purred or yawned in their neat wire cages and appreciated their visitors. There were black, red, white, brown, yellow and grey cats; purebred cats, pedigreed cats, striped cats of doubtful ancestry, kittens of all sizes and colors. It was a real cat show for cat fanciers and of much interest to all who had the opportunity to crowd through the show. CANARY BIRDS In number and quality the song birds met the expectations of their . ■ friends. : The place allotted was scarcely large enough but the lady attendants cheerfully showed their birds to the best advantage. The . exhibits were arranged in classes. Parrots, mocking birds and other species added color 4f not harmony, \o the ensemble. APARTMENT HOUSE ON WHEELS A two-room apartment house completely furnished with built-in breakfast-nook, cupboards, wardrobe, folding bed and electric lights within a Douglas fir log was appreciated by all. I was apprised by the proprietor of this exhibit while I was in Dallas, Texas, recently, • that he had been making fairs for the past three years with this exhibit and the largest number of people that ever visited this log cabin in one day was the ten thousand who passed through it on Monday of our fair. U. S. SHIPPING BOARD EXHIBIT Representatives of the shipping board at Washington had a well arranged" exhibit on the balcony of the club building. They invited questions about the technique and the economics of water transporta - • .. tion and showed without bent or bias why . the government should own and operate a fleet of passenger and freight carriers. They in - terested visitors at their booth and were- themselves interested in the questions and suggestions offered by their visitors. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE SMUT TRAIN SPECIAL Another feature that must not be overlooked was the wheat smut train that was parked on convenient tracks inside the grounds, upon its return from an educational pilgrimage over the state. It was presided over by faculty men from the Agricultural College. It was estimated that 49,000 interested spectators passed through the train and 62,000 passed through the cab of the big mogul locomotive ex - hibited by the Burlington system. It gave apparent life to the train and was in itself an interesting demonstration of the progress made in steam transportation. MACHINERY EXHIBIT There were acres and acres of the, latest improved labor saving farm implements and the showing was the most complete ever held. Corn pickers, threshers, combines, centrifugal pumps for irrigation, and many other demonstrations were of special interest. Many sales were made direct from the exhibit as well as orders taken for future delivery. Some of the larger exhibitors sold out their exhibits com - pletely. At a meeting in Chicago, in December, of the members in the midwest circuit of fairs, of. which we are a member, it was decided to furnish farm implement exhibitors free space, but charge for all tickets and passes at the regular rates. MANUFACTURERS' BUILDING The Manufacturers' Building was filled to capacity with the latest improved conveniences for the farm and home. The exhibit could be increased one hundred per cent if a suitable building could be provided. FISH EXHIBIT The Nebraska State Fish exhibit is sponsored by the Department of Agriculture. The fish exhibit building was thronged from early morn until late at nierht; frequently the crowds were so great in front of the glass tanks that it was impossible to read the names and descriptions of the fish. Almost every variety of fish of all sizes, shapes and colors were on exhibition. In fact the Nebraska State Fair stands second to none on its fish exhibit. It seems to me the Department of Fish and Game have a wonderful opportunity to edu - cate the interested patrons of the Fair in fish culture. It isn't enough any more to see, but they want to know how, when, and why. It can be made one of the outstanding educational exhibits of the Fair. SEVENTEEN STATE INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTED Appropriate to the purpose, the attractive booths maintained by the state-supported institutions proved of serious and educational in- \[ </seg>
            <seg id="p029">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE terest to the thousands of visitors on the balcony of the Agricultural Hall. The exhibits were intended to attract and to inform. Most of the time representatives and courteous attendants were at their places to answer questions and visit pleasantly with inquiring guests. Gen - erally the booths contained the handiwork of the inmates of the in - stitutions. "The growing interest on the part of the 'public in its wards and their care, as well as the popular demand to know what is being done with the taxpayers' money justified fair visitors in inquiring what is being done at state institutions. It is not hard to foresee that the tendency is growing to make the state fair a panorama of all the state's activities. BUTTER SCULPTURE The striking piece to attract the eye as a visitor entered the Agri - cultural Hall was the Nebraska Aboriginal Cow Beast sculptured by J. E. Wallace. It required 600 pounds of Nebraska made butter to make the piece. More modern, but equally appealing, was the like - ness of Beauty Girl, a Nebraska cow, credited with 32,175 pounds of milk in a year, from which was manufactured 1,383 pounds of butter. PRESS BUREAU The Press Bureau began work on Monday, one week before the opening of the Fair. News stories were sent to out-state dailies and . weekly newspapers. The news, stories gave information of forth - coming events of interest at the fair and were quite generally used. We appreciate the fine co-operation that has existed between the fair and. the newspaper men of the state. It has done much' to increase the attendance. We should provide permanent quarters for the press department where it would be established each year. In connection with the work room' there should be a visiting place set apart, where out-state newspaper men could gather. THE TENTED CITY There were approximately 6,000 campers, most of whom stayed four or five days and some for the entire week. The cottages were . filled from the opening day and more could have been rented to the many applicants. They seemed to be a lot of good sports and out for a good time. There was a disposition for everyone to get acquainted with every one else. The social side of camping at the fair was not overlooked. Every convenience was provided, water, lights, toilets, streets cindered, a new grocery store and many other minor improve - ments that add to the facilities for comfortable and inexpensive camp - ing, which no doubt contributed to the attendance. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A PRESSING PROBLEM _ We have on the grounds, 24 ladies' toilets consisting of 198 stools. There are 18 mens' toilets consisting of 139 stools and 14 urinals which would seem to be sufficient. But' when the throngs of people unacquainted with streets and directions come surging here and there the conveniences must be frequent and the signs obvious. A similar suggestion would apply to drinking fountains. Such criticisms as came to our ears was kindly, but investigation proved that it was merited. ELECTRIC SYSTEM Our electrician gave us good service and at a much less expense • than in previous years. The Lincoln Public Service Company was asked to move its line which connected with the sewerage disposal plant and ran through the implement field. They decided to abandon the line entirely, which made it necessary to construct a new line from a substation just outside the fair grounds on the south side to • the carnival grounds. In making this change it was found that the existing fair line, which was in poor condition, could be changed at the same time with a nominal cost, which was done. Service to the amphitheatre was made more reliable by extending the carnival line into the transformer room and installing there a double throw switch. This switch was so arranged that the amphi - theatre could be switched on at a moment's notice to either of the two primary lines having their source of supply at different points in the city of Lincoln, giving us a dual system of lighting. Due to the extensive improvement made in the Extension Building it was necessary to completely rewire this building and made special devices for the exhibit by the Federal government. The demands upon the lighting system are increased every year. This increase is estimated at twenty-five per cent yearly. From this it can be seen that the capacity must be doubled every four years. For instance a 25 K. V. A. transformer installed two years ago to accommodate part of the east section of the grounds was completely loaded by the Extension Building alone this year where the load had more than doubled. Concession men and exhibitors are using more f light and moving displays. A new line was constructed out through the parking field, which was a great help to the machinery men as well as in locating cars. THE HI-Y BOYS { The Hi-Y Boys were very satisfactory in handling the crowds in the grandstand. These boys arrived in Lincoln, Septemher 2nd and </seg>
            <seg id="p031">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 3rd from thirty-one different localities. There was a total attendance of ninety-one boys and eleven leaders., Thirty-five came from the country and fifty-six from towns. Twelve denominations were repre- . sented among the boys and seventy-one belonged to church. Seventy - five were between the ages ofj fifteen and seventeen, while nine were past eighteen. In addition to eleven leaders there were six Y. M. C. A. secretaries as members of staff. I like the idea of bringing the boys in from over the state and it might be well to start early and let them merit something in their home community in- order to be eligible for the State Fair. STATE FAIR ON WHEELS The parade on Thursday started on . scheduled time and was by far the largest and most representative of any previous year. It started promptly at one o'clock, the grandstand was packed and the fences lined with people .The parade is getting to be one of the out - standings activities that is creating a great deal of interest to both old and young. It is proof of. Nebraska's marvelous growth and evi - dence of the Nebraska that is yet to come. It is the one place where in one hour's time you can see all of Nebraska's prize winners in stock and the people that made them possible. It is proof that there are just as many specialists on the farms of Nebraska as there are in the schools and universities of Nebraska. It was a compliment to our rural population and brought us all to realize more clearly than ever before that if we have a permanent prosperity in Nebraska it must be done through and by the people on the farms. ; AUTOMOBILE EXHIBIT The Automobile Exhibit always creates a great deal of interest, coming as it does in the season of the year when the new models are coming out. The exhibitors are beginning to realize that at the Ne - braska State Fair they get in touch with actual buyers from all over . this section . of the country. It makes an imposing exhibit and is not only a credit to the fair but an indication of the progressiveness of the dealers' of the state. . • THE MIDWAY The Clarence A. Wortham's World's Best Shows, now owned by Beckman and Gerity, were engaged for the midway attraction and as far as I know gave perfect satisfaction. It must be remembered that ■ the State Fair Board does not allow games of any kind, nor- shows of disrepute, nor was there any attempt by the show management to ' over-ride any rules laid down by the Fair Board. The managers of the shows are real business men and satisfactory gentlemen with whom to do business. . </seg>
            <seg id="p032">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE But the time has come, however, when Fairs the size and caliber of the Nebraska State Fair must strike a higher level than carnival companies to entertain the visitors. It seems to be impossible in the carnival world to provide new attractions. In this day and age when people travel widely and see the best, they are satisfied with nothing but the best. AUTO RACING The auto races continue to draw large crowds. It has become a sport so firmly fixed and of such interest that it is impossible to take care of the crowds on auto racing days. Prior to 1903 automobile racing was heard of only as between Henry Ford's wonderful 999 and Alexandria Winton with his two famous Bullets creation?. During the year mentioned, the Packard Motor Car Company built the racer, Gray Wolf and the Peerless Com - pany of Cleveland, the Green Dragon. The first international dirt track contest was held in 1904 over the Empire City Track, New York, in which Barney Oldfield participated as driver of the Peerless Com - pany's Green Dragon. Under the sanctions issued by the Motor Con - test Association, there were held in 1927 fifty auto race meetings, or I seventy-five days of racing. HORSE RACING The up-to-date State Fair seeks to entertain, educate and to demon - strate to its patrons, the progress made as the years come and go. I can well remember when a three-minute trotter would draw a much larger crowd than Peter Maning would today in trotting his mile in 1:59*4. There was nothing startling about the 1927 racing program, but it seemed to please our guests. The racing program cost $13,322.00. HORSE PULLING CONTEST The team pulling contest with the constant resistance dynamometer was held for the first time at the State Fair in 1926. Interest had not yet been aroused in the state, so that there were only a few entries for this contest. The 1927 contest was a very material advance over the first year's effort. Interest in the state contest increased with the greater in - terest shown by the county fairs. In 1927 teams were brought in • from distant counties, showing us that there is a possibility of making this contest a real state contest for good pulling teams. Better ar - rangements were made for the care of the audience in 1927, and a conservative estimate places the crowd staying to witness this contest at 20,000. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTUR HORESHOE PITCHING Horseshoe pitching is a skillful and wholesome sport and its de - votees are in no sense a sectional group. It draws from farm, village and city. This was the fourth annual exhibition of from sixty to ninety of Nebraska's best pitchers. They go into a three-day session ' to arrive at some conclusion how they might individually rank. Forty men may play at once. Five hundred dollars are divided into sixteen , prizes and trophies. The pitching: lanes are now second to none. ■ The stakes are all held at their lower end in a substantial block of wood and imbedded in the ground so that the top is just ten inches above the bed of clay in which the shoes alight, and are just forty feet apart, as per national regulation. Many people come to watch •the contest and get rested up from the day's fatigue of sight-seeing. EIGHT-DAY FAIR . . The. eight-day fair is no experiment, practically all the state fairs adjoining us are holding for eight days. ■ The attendance during the Fair last year is convincing proof that the fair period must be ex - panded in order to give all wlo want to see the exposition of products, the races and other special attractions, a chance to do so. A longer period will help if weather conditions are unfavorable. And again, as our dates happen to be on the week that many schools start in ■ Nebraska, all the teachers and many of the students do not have an opportunity to attend. By making Saturday and Sunday teachers' and students' days we can overcome that criticism. The exhibitors and con - cession men will appreciate the eight-day fair; they are at the same expense for preparing and transporting their exhibits in one case as in the other and the addition of. two more days would enable them to interest a greater number of people in the things they have to sell and show. IN CONCLUSION We have had many comments upon the success of the State Fair. I will read just two of them. 'I had the privilege of ittending the Nebraska State Fair this year, and I have no hesitation in saying that it surpassed any fair which I had attended this year and I see most of the large events in our territory. Nebraska can certainly be very proud of her wonderful State 1 Fair. .;,;•;■ (Signei) ARTHUR W. LARGE, Agricultural Agent, Chicago Rock Island Railway Company, Chicago ! Illinois."

You have built one of the greatest exhibitions of its kind and must have the support of the whole state in order that its products and its wares may be properly exhibited. It is also evident from the growth and popularity of the the Boys' and Girls' 4-H Clubs that additional building for these ex - hibits must be provided. The work of these clubs is considered by ' practically everyone as being one of the most important pieces of extension work fostered by the Agricultural College and the State Board of Agriculture. ! (Signed) LINCOLN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, WALTER WHITTEN, Secretary." I have never gone through a Fair that caused me as little trouble as the 1927 Fair. The Board was in executive session not to exceed twenty minutes during the entire week.

I There are many organizations and individuals that contributed to j the success of the 1927 Fair.

It is a very exhaustive and able report as to the activities of the Fair held in 1927. I am sure we are all proud of the position this Fair holds' with other Fairs in this great Missis - sippi Valley in which we live. This Fair is one of the greatest agricul - tural and educational exhibits in the United States. It has grown from the small beginnings. I had the pleasure last night of speaking at Columbia, Missouri under the auspices of the State Agricultural Board of Missouri. This Secretary in speaking of the long service of the Board of Agriculture of that state pointed out that their Board of Agriculture had existed for sixty-five years; but' I think that our Board of Agriculture has been in existence approximately sixty or sixty-five years. But during all of these years these institu - tions have been growing and they have been getting better and per - forming real service to the people of the several states which they serve; This organization which we have been privileged to represent has been outstanding in its real service to the people of Nebraska. When we consider that there has been paid to the producers of this State in premiums more than has been appropriated by the Legisla - ture for all purposes for this institution, we know it is one of real merit, but when we consider that in addition to this that this in - stitution has accumulated buildings for the State and acquired more than a million dollars worth of property in the form of grounds, buildings and equipment we know that this institution has meant something in the upbuilding of this State. I want to congratulate the Secretary on this report which he has rendered. </seg>

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Nebraska State Board of Agri- . 1| culture, before I begin to read this report I wish to explain that there are a few notations and matters that you will discover as we read the report, where the Revision Committee is making a few changes. While they are not radical, they involve considerable money. To get you all •11 in good humor I wish to assure you right now in this report which the Revision Committee is about to make that the word "Cat" does not appear. I feel very grateful to Secretary Jackson who this morning - while the committee were busy whipping their reports into shape had a call over the phone. It appeared that the lady calling from some - where was very anxious to come down and present something to the committee for some changes in the 1 ca,t show and its premiums that she had discovered some new breed and George worked out of it in a very diplomatic way and handled the situation very nicely. He gave the lady to understand that everything relating to oats would have to go on the waiting list. Now gentlemen I will give this report as rapidly and as distinctly as I can and you can follow me by looking in the Premium List. I want to say that there are a great many minor changes that will ap - pear in the next premium list. The Revision Committee felt that they ' did not want to burden you with a report that did not mean anything. Now there are forty kinds of pickles and sixty kinds of other various things that may be rather interesting, but hot to the men. You don't look much interested in pickles, at least the gentlemen around", me don't look like any of them are pickles. </seg>

The Superintendent of the sheep, department, Mr. Parkinson, some of the authorities at the Agricultural College, and other places all seemed to think that we had to do something, or had to make this change, which is going back more or less to the old original plan, Mr. Chairman.

BY CHAIRMAN GRAFF: There is a change in the rules in this class where the entries are limited to amateurs. BY SECRETARY JACKSON: Mr. Vice-President and Chairman of the committee, with our plan for an eight-day fair, it is not going to work very well if the exhibits are not to be in place until Monday. We will have to have everything ready by Friday noon, or 9:00 or . whatever time is fixed and these changes will have to be made as we go along. BY VICE PRESIDENT WEAVER: This is the only place there has been a change of time noted, or the time has been fixed. BY MEMBER L. C. CHAPIN; of Lincoln; Lancaster County. In this particular class that is referred to, there is much perishable material exhibited and I think that day should be fixed as the big. day of the fair, whether that is the open day or not. While those exhibits are perishable, they can be quickly arranged. I expect that i can be left to the Secretary to change at his option just before the premium list is printed and by then we will know what day you want to have put in there. BY SECRETARY JACKSON: Mr. Chapin, do you suppose you can keep them there fresh and impact during the entire Fair? BY MR.

            <seg id="p057">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is recommended that the Board of Managers be empowered to correct any errors or anything that may have been overlooked in the revision of the premium list.' Signed CHAS. GRAFF, Chairman CHAS. GRAU A. W. LAMB J. S. GOLDER A. H. MILLER h. j. Mclaughlin. BY CHAIRMAN GRAFF: Now, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, in submitting this report you have noticed that the changes in the Cattle Department are by far the most sweeping of any. As you heard in the Secretary's report our Beef Cattle show has been going backward. I want to give you. a little explanation-of the situation bearing on that exhibit in Nebraska as compared to the other states in the section of the country mentioned in his report In some of Jhese other states business agencies, clubs, Chambers of Commerce and certain Breeding Associations within that state have put up money which they have paid in addition to what the Fair Board has put in those states, that is a reason why they can make a better showing in the amount of money they pay in those states. That is a situation we have never encouraged in Nebraska and it may be we can find a way around this without taking up that sort of a program. It works this way We will take Iowa or Illinois. A certain breeding association puts in ah extra ?500, ?600, or $800 and says to the Board of Managers of tKe Fair, we will put up that much provided you put up that much more additional. Then the exhibitors in that particular breed in that state' can go into the show ring and take all of this money and the fellow from Nebraska with his herd don't get any of that. Fellows from outside of that state most generally get that additional money which is so put up. I want you to get the money here. Those are the reasons the Committee has recommended a raise in the prize money on the Beef breeds in the State of Nebraska and I believe this raise is a just one. . We also as you will notice have added a little to a couple of tlTe Dairy Breeds. I believe that is. also just. Then I am willing to let the bars down and let the competitors from other states come in here and meet us on our own ground. We feel that the state of Nebraska has just as good cattle and can meet the competition from Illinois, Iowa or elsewhere from other states. I move the adoption of the report. BY MR. E. J. MITCHELL; Thayer County: To how much will the proposed increases amount? BY MR. GRAFF: ?3034.00. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE BY MR. MITCHELL: The reason that I asked this that we have always tried to base the premiums for our county fair on a proportion of what is paid on each class at the State Fair, and We have tried to give on about half of what they do at the State Fair. But we cannot keep that up as we cannot afford to pay so much. If you raise these at the State Fair we can't pay as much to keep up with Lizzie. Our premiums would total $3500 and we can't pay that out of $2000. BY MR. A. H. MILLER. I second the motion to adopt the report. BY VICE PRESIDENT WEAVER: Are there any remarks? BY MR. GRAU; Douglas County: The committee was agreed on a point upon which they had a letter from Scottsbluff and there was a great deal of talk from other sources and that is on this point, that Henry Field had no right in the Agricultural Hall and that the incom - ing board of managers should see fit to put Henry Field in some commerical building instead of in Agricultural Hall. BY SECRETARY JACKSON: We have already given consider - ation to that, it will be taken care of. • BY VICE PRESIDENT WEAVER: Are there any further re - marks? All those in favor of the adoption of this report will signify by saying "Aye"; contrary "No". The motion is carried. (Secretary Jackson presented a telegram from Belleville, Kansas) (Mr. Lewis of the Dan Desdunes Colored Band of Omaha was introduced.) BY VICE PRESIDENT WEAVER. I am advised that the Resolu- j tions Committee is not ready to report. We will receive a report of that committee in the morning. I would suggest that it would now be in order to receive a j motion to pay the delegates and it is necessary to have a proper . motion passed to that effect. BY SENATOR A. H. MILLER: I move that we pay the dele - gates four dollars per day per diem plus railroad fare, three days for attendance, including tomorrow and that those who have been required ■ to bp here a longer time for committee attendance received the per diem for the extra number of days.

            <seg id="p060">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE £ us the man that we picked. Now I am going to present to you one of the soberest men we have in this town or any other town. I am pretty sure you have had a good enough time for the past two days that you will put uy with him. Now I am going to introduce to you the man whom I hope you will put up with, George Jackson, Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture. MR. GEORGE JACKSON: Mr. Chairman, and folks. I am not going to call you ladies, and gentlemen because I know you too well. We have had a wonderful meeting here this week and we are going to continue. We are not through yet. We are going to have a good time tonight, because we have got lots of good talent. I am not going to tire you out with a long speech, but I am going to introduce the fellow who will. It pays to advertise. That never appealed to me so strong and not until I was in Chicago recently. I have something that is almost too bad to tell, but it is too good to keep. I was up there in Chicago for several days with Mr. Tolen, Perry Reed and some of the boys and we stopped at the Congress Hotel. In one corner was a big poster and it said on that bill board "Big chorus of eighty voices at the Majestic Theatre". This organization outstrips any of its kind in the city. Mr. Webster said, I would like to see that. Mr. Tolen said let's go. Reed said I don't care if we do so we followed the lure of the music and got tickets right near the orchestra. I don't know whether you fellows have ever noticed all of these contraptions that the drummer has around. Anyway Mr. Webster in his effort to express his appreciation got up so close that he got his feet tangled up in those contraptions and I had to change seats with him. As we went out, we asked Mr. Webster how he liked the show and he said it was the most daring, bareback performance that he had seen in a long time. The first speaker on the program is a man whom I have known for years and years. At one time he was considered the- greatest State Fair Secretary in the United States. But I was elected three years ago and I am perfectly satisfied with myself. Now you probably expect a wonderful speech from Mr. Mellor. He is a very highly educated man and he speaks four languages: English, German, French and Profane. All that you have got to do with him is to throw in a dinner and out will bob a speech. So I am going to introduce to you without any further evidences as to his standing as an after-dinner speaker, Mr. W. R. Mellor, one time Secretary of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. Mr. W. R. MELLOR. Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen. You see I am not ad - verse to calling you that, because I don't know you so well. He says all that is necessary is to open my mouth and put in a dinner and out </seg>
            <seg id="p061">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE comes the speech. I warn you ladies and gentlemen, that after you open your mouth and take in one of George Jackson's speeches out will come your dinner. Just a few minutes ago he leaned over and gave me that old time worn saying, "shall we have your speech now or let them enjoy themselves a little longer." When I went up there the other day after he called me to his office and said he wanted me to speak for a few moments to you people, I said, "How long do you want me to talk, George", and he said not very long. I will just tell you the story and let you draw your own conclusions. A poor fellow walked into the church one day, sat down in the last pew and listened to the preacher for about fifteen minutes and then said to the next fel - low, How long has he been preaching, and received the answer, about thirty-five years. The fellow remarked, IgujssI will wait a little longer for he will quit pretty soon. The subject given to me was "Reminiscence of the State. Fair Board." Thirty-four years ago today I came to the first meeting of that Board. I came because we didn't have any crops up in central Nebraska and I happened to be the Bur - lington Land Agent up in that country and I had a pass, so they said "let Mellor go down, it won't cost him anything. 1 ' The next year Omaha and Lincoln were having a great fight for the location of the Fair for the next five years. In those days they used to have the Fair held for five years in Omaha and for five years iin Lincoln, provided they could get enough votes to change the place. At that time, in 1895, they, had a very large meeting. Omaha had fifty votes and Lincoln had 49; and there were ninety-nine delegates present. In 1896 I attended the State Fair at Omaha for two days, Wednesday and Thursday. The next winter, when John Bowen made his Treasurers report he showed a little over two thousand dollars taken in for the grandstand. It was moved that the report be accepted and placed on file. Mr. Henry then in . the chair said all in favor of the motion say "Aye". I jumped up and said, don't we have any chance for re - marks in this institution and he said Yes, do you want to say some - thing? I told them that I had been to the Fair for two days, Wed - nesday and Thursday arid had gone into the grandstand in the after - noon and paid my fifty cents and the papers had said there were four thousand people there on both of those days and I thought there were. Now they had Monday, Tuesday and Friday besides Wed - nesday and Thursday and I wanted to know how it happened that they only got a little over two thousand dollars. Well they said, we can't discuss that now, we will tell you about that later. I found out later that I had not been bright enough along with many other country peo - ple to ask for a pass, but that the people in Lincoln and Omaha usually did so, . . : . ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p062">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mr. Harahan, President of the Illinois Central Railroad sat in his office one time when a big burly Irishman came tearing in and hol - lered, "My name is Casey, I want a pass to St. Louis. I work down in the yards." Mr. Harahan said, when you come in to ask for a favor you should come in more quietly and ask very politely. I think you can go out for an hour and then come back again. So the Irishman - went out. In an hour he came back. He took off his hat and said "Good morning, my name is Casey and I work down in the yards," Mr. Harahan said, "How do you do ,Mr. Casey. What can I do for you?" He answered "I got a pass on the Wabash. You can go to Hell". In the year 1898 Omaha did not hold a State Fair because of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. In 1899 they did not hold a Fair, be - cause of the Greater- American Exposition. I was put on the Board in i898. In 1900 among- others who were put on the Board of Managers was Mr. Austin Humphrey. He died in February. Mr. Bassett, the president appointed me on the Board of Managers and there I worked in 1900, 1901, 1902 and 1903. At the first meeting of this Board in 1900, the citizens of Lincoln had paid four thousand dollars to get us back here to fix up the grounds for us, so we on the Board were re - quired to sign a note for five thousand dollars for operation' of " the Fair. That was my first initiation . on the Board of Managers. In 1904 and 1905 I acted as President of this association and in 1906 I was elected Secretary. From 1900 to 1906 it was our custom to try to get the railroads to run special trains to bring people to the Fair. In 1900 the Fair had $33,995 paid admissions. A good many of your County Fairs now have more than that. We tried to get special trains to run from different points in the state and some extra equipment on the regular trains and then we would have to get out to the Fair Grounds on a shuttle train that ran to the depot back and forth. Nowadays you don't ha,ve to be bothered with that when everybody comes in automobiles. The Sunday school teacher one day asked her class if they could tell the difference between the quick and the dead; and one little boy held up his hand. She said, "What is the difference Johnny", and he said "The quicker those that get out of the way of the autos than those who don't are the dead". So i\ow you people have a chance to look after the quick. I noticed in the year 1906 our friend, Elliot Davis became an ex - hibitor in the Nebraska State Fair and he has been an exhibitor ever since. There are a great many others who have experienced the same thing. In 1908 we found that Nebraska people were not accorded the representation we thought they were entitled in the Shorthorn Breeders Association of America. We were getting about five hundred dollars a year that was not in keeping with Nebraska's position as one of the leading Shorthorn cattle states in the Union. We thought we better do something to increase that appropriation so about three or </seg>
            <seg id="p063">RKPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE four months before the meeting we began a campaign to get proxies. We got about three or four hundred and Tom Plynn of Iowa got about the same. Tom and I sat our heads together. Tom Wornell was the only man west of the Mississippi river who was then on the directorate : of that association. We picked on Frank Harden, John Tomson, *Z ™° Ur SPe3ker tOn '' ehtl T ° m Worne11 ' A - C - Shallenberger, and Tom Flynn as the five to be elected. After a considerable fight we stood pat and got those five men and Nebraska got fifteen hundred dollars the next year from the American Shorthorn Breeders Associ - ation Since that time I believe you men have had a pretty good ap - • propnation from those people. " ' In 1909 we commenced to use the Australian Ballot System that you people, have used- practically ever since in election on this Board. Prior to that time we have appointed a committee of five who would go out and as they had three from the Board they always controlled it. I dont know whether they did or not but some imagined that. Now m 1910 there were only about twenty, county societies at that time meetmg which we held right jhere in this same Lindell Hotel We thought it would be a good plan to have an organization perfected so we perfected the organization and called it The Nebraska Association of County, District, and State Fair Managers. We started at that bme with George W. Hervey as President, L. H. Cheney as Vice President, and William H .Smith as Secretary-Treasurer. The next year there were thirty-eight organizations represented. Ryan of Indianola, Jackson of Nelson, Cheney and Pigman of Broken Bow were some of the leaders. Now in 1 1911 we had had some new members elected, I think including Mr, Banning. I heard a good story on him today that just before Christmas he was up here in Rudge &amp; Guenzels looking around as if he were trying to study out something. One of ■ the floor walkers saw him and went up and said, "Can I be of any assistance to you, and Bill said, I don't know what it was I was here to buy, a camisole or a casserole. I don't know which". The floor walker said if you will tell me what kind of a chicken you want to put into it, I will tell you which it is. Now one of our valuable men was Charlie Graff who was another man elected in 1911. George Jackson was another of those elected at that time. These three men are now the oldest members of 'the State Board of Agriculture 1911 was a rather outstanding year for the State Board of Agriculture. Mr. c. W. Sanborn on the 27th day of January, 1911 introduced a bill in the Legislature, then representing Sarpy County, for $100,000 for a grand stand, but that bill was defeated. But in the Senate • we got it put in at $15,000 to repair the grand stand and build the sewer. We built the sewer and then took down the old grand stand I had been around several different State Fairs where they had grand </seg>
            <seg id="p064">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE stands and had secured some ideas as to how a grand stand could be built. I took plans for one section to Bill Foster and said, "Could you build that from this drawing, could you build that so that an - other section could be added as needed. He said he could so we went to work and used the lumber from the old grand stand and built that section on a new one for less than $20, (TOO, total cost at that time. Now there were some other bills introduced at that session of the Legislature. A fellow by the name of Henry Gerdes of Richardson County introduced five bills all with the intention of taking monies collected by different state boards and putting it into the Treasurer's office, only to be taken back out by warrants. I went to Henry Gerdes and told him that we couldn't pay our exhibitors if they passed that law and he said he didn't care if we did or not. It passed through the House with a whoop and a hurrah. Senator Ollis was on the Senate committee when it went over there and it was referred to then with the four other bills that disappeared and they didn't know what became of them. Gerdes was running around during the last week wanting to know where his bills were and he came into my office and I told him that if his bill passed we couldn't pay our ex - hibitors. I went and saw Governor Aldrich and told him if it passed he should veto it. He said let it pass and then ho could find some reason to veto it. Ollis went ahead and got a University bill passed on that theory. That was submitted on the lasr day to the Governor,. and he said, come here Bill I want to see you. Where are these five j Gerdes bills. What shall I do with them. I said there is one that I want you to veto. He vetoed it and gave his reasons and that was the inside story of the bill we faced which would have compelled the State Board of Agriculture to pay all warrants through the State Treasurer's office, which would make it a month or so before the ex - hibitor would get his money. Soon after that in 1913 we had another bill in the Legislature calling for $1T)O,OOO for an Agricultural Hall and $8,000 of which would buy land. That bill was introduced by Mike Lee and George • Jackson. That is the only bill of its kind I ever knew of that was put through without a cut. We got our Agricultural Hall and we got forty acres of land on one side and forty on the other. Now our grounds have something like 185 acres in it. You will recall that in an address the day before the assassins bullet struck President McKinley in a speech at Buffalo he brought out the thought that all Fairs and Expositions are time pieces that mark the progress of na - tions and record the worlds advancement, that stimulate the energy and intellect of people, quickens human genius and all that pertains to right living, open the nations storehouse of information to students. They used to think I was daffy about calling the State Fair an edu- </seg>

The number of people who attend the State Fair is about twenty-five percent of the number of people who attend - the University in a whole year so you see it has an educational appeal. There is a benefit derived from a State Fair that might be called one to four with a University. We are all proud of our won - derful University and the things it is doing for the State of Nebraska. (At this time the entertainment by the Western Vaudeville Offi - cers was continued.) SECRETARY JACKSON: We have another party here whom I want to introduce. I don't know whether you people have ever seen two grandpas together in your life. But I was at H. J. McLaughlin's and Frank Tomson came in there. You know McLaughlin's son mar - ried Tomson's daughter and they have a little boy four months old called Tommy. Frank Tomson got to talking about this little fellow and McLaughlin left his work and went over and joined them. Frank said he never saw anything like it in his life. With that kid lying there kicking and cooing just like a little Chester white pig ana McLaug-hlin just swore that that kid said grandpa just as plain as if he were a year old and he never saw anything like it in his life. Then I met Mrs. Tomsori and she said Frank was just going around all the time about that baby and she said, you know the other day. I' found him up in the music room singing at the top of . his voice with all crescendoes I and diminuendoes, a beautiful song, not one that the old people sing, not an old. song where the music and words blend together but that old song, Rock a bye Baby upon the tree top, when the wind blows the cradle will rock, when the bough breaks down will come baby, cradle and all. Now I introduce to you Mr. Tomson. • ; BY FRANK D. TOMSON. j Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies aijd Gentlemen, I will admit I said the little grandson looked like a [chester white pig but I hesitate to think what might happen if this baby grandson of ours should grow up some day and come to look [like George Jackson. You know Mrs. Tomson, ever since we have been in Lincoln has always had a kind of hankering to have me become a member of this State Board of Agriculture which manages the Fair. On a number of occasions she has suggested that it would be 1 , a fine thing that I could be elected to this. Board. I said, "What makes you think so and she said, "You would be associated with such a fine body of men". So I thought when George invited me to make a talk tonight that I would let Mrs. Tomson come along and let her look these men over and judge of this fine array. Now I am curious to know whether she will still insist that. I should become a member of your Board. I </seg>
            <seg id="p066">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thought as Mr. Mellor was speaking of the great man who had been Secretary of this Fair and I don't know of any other Fair that has succeeded so well in spite of it's Secretary. Seems to me the State Fair might have done very much better had George Jackson taken up singing or something of that kind for instance. Seems to me lie might have got by, he's got a good deal of music in him though it might not just sound like it when it comes out. I noticed the gentleman who was here on the stage and I was just trying to think how George would look in that kind of an outfit and I think if you would put him in the suit you would certainly have a display ad. Now speaking of advertising, and laying all of these little jibes aside and speaking of advertising for Nebraska; yesterday forty some steers sold at Omaha at $18.00 per cwt. That is the first time in the last eight years that the average price per head has been that high. Now that is good advertising for Nebraska. The day before or maybe the same day, a Nebraska Judging Team went to ' Denver and won the first prize over all the other Judging Teams for the third time in succession. That is the first time in the history of that show that any team has won for three times and these boys have won a cup by two or three times in succession. I was down in Chicago late in November or early in December at the International Show. Perhaps you people saw the pictures of a Nebraska girl who took her cow pony there and that little lady was the greatest feature of the whole show in Chicago. This little lady and her little pony simply stepped out and stormed the whole United States and then unfortunately by one little slip failed to win in the other event. You can hardly conceive of the value to Nebraska of the advertising that one little lady accomplished all by herself. I understand that she is here, so let's have her stand up. Some of you remember Colonel Edmonston the old auctioneer who ] was an old time Kentuckian. He told of a horse show where there were horses from four or five different counties. They were judg - ing saddle horses. They had a committee of three judging who had failed to agree and each one picked a different horse. Finally they j called for Colonel Huckins, who came and asked to know what they wanted of him so they told him they wanted him to decide, these gentlemen can't agree and everyone picks a different horse, so we want you to decide. He said move this horse aside, is there any horse from Bourbon County so that they led out a knock-kneed little sorrel and he gave this horse first place. They protested and said "you haven't even looked at the other horses'!. He said, "I noticed it's every man for his own county so I am for that horse for Ye Gods, I am from Bourbon County". </seg>
            <seg id="p067">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This has been a very important week for you and your sessions here in taking up the business of the County Fairs. That State ■ Pair, of course, is an outstanding achievement. It has accomplished a great deal in bringing Nebraska to. the attention of the public at large. But after all, I want to say to you that it is the County Fairs, and the Local Fairs, which come nearer to reflecting the prog - .ress and stability of the State than even does the State Fair. I would not detract in the least from the State Fair but it is the local fairs which, more closely reach your neighborhood thought and present your neighborhood achievement. You get very close to the thought and methods of your community and these local expositions. You have contributed immeasurably in recent years to the advance - ments and assertions of the club work. The pioneering era in the Fair business is now largely over with and the entertainment fea - ture has now passed the day of it's former importance and is largely incidental now. You are engaged now in a kind of instructive edu - cational effort that represents the great dominating factor in determin - ing the extent of progress we will make here in this Agricultural State. I long ago came to the conclusion that the most import - ant institution of all is the lo|cal Fair that concerns it primarily with the progress of the young people through their club work • and through their dlub contests of various natures. They get very close to the parents of these young people. Now that is where we are going to build for the greatness of Nebraska and we are strengthening agriculture in this State. No other state to my knowledge is so completely Agricultural. No other state in the same length of time or in the same period of years has attained • such a high level of accomplishments as has Nebraska. No other state offers so much for the money you have to invest as Nebraska. No other state in all respect is so well-balanced as Nebraska. And no other state offers so inviting a field for the development of all it's resources and for promoting the things with which we are con - cerned and with which we are identified. Ladies and gentlemen, you have had a very interesting program. We have been giving 'very earnest thought to the possibility of this State which as you know . has a higher level of literacy with one or two exceptions than any State in the Union; and that with one or two exceptions, the only State without any bonded indebtedness. We have the most wonder - ful State in all respects to live in that there is in the United States but it is our earnest desire to do everything to the betterment of our State, I thank you. SECRETARY JACKSON: I wonder if you can stand fifteen min - utes more. I have three men here whom I am "going to let have five minutes apiece. First gentlemen is one whom you all know, a man with a family of six children and has a house big enough for twelve. </seg>
            <seg id="p068">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE He is only fifty years old and I am going to introduce him to you now. Mr. A. J. Weaver of Falls City. BY MR. WEAVER: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen, with the gracious intro - duction given to me by my old friend, George Jackson, I am afraid I will not be able to live up to your expectations. I am very much in the position of a little boot-black in Chicago who right after the great war had a big soldier step up to his stand. He looked at the number twelves and hollered to his companion, "Come over here Billy and lend me some spit. I've got a government contract on my hands." I have certainly appreciated the opportunity of attending the session of the County Fair Association this morning and of the State Fair Board this afternoon and then this interesting banquet tonight. I especially appreciate the history given to us by W. R. Mellor our past Secretary. He omitted a historical fact, however, that he might have brought out, and would like to supplement to the interest a recital of events given by our first speaker. I had the honor of introducing the bill in 1899 which located the State Fair permanently at Lincoln. I want to congratulate you not only on the progress which this State Board of Agriculture has made in its sixty years but on the splendid progress which this State Fair Association is making; and I want to congratulate you especially on the good that comes from organizations such as these which bring together the State Fair and the Local Fairs. When we mingle as we do here so we can get the other fellow's viewpoint then we understand in a better way how to solve our problems. If we simply support the things we have in this country we can advance our American democracy. There isn't any reason why America, where every citizen is as good as every other citizen, should not individually progress as long as every American lives up to his opportunity. To illustrate what I mean it was this great spirit of Democracy that makes this country great. A few years ago an illustrious Englishman came over to this coun - try and stopped in New York City. As he wandered out on Broadway he met one of our common American citizens and he asked- this fel - low, who was a red headed Irishman, what his rank was and then the Englishman went on talking about England and telling about his own rank. That over in his country he was the Knight of Bath, the Kniu'ht of the Garter, and a Knight of the Golden Circle. Then he asked the Irishman again what was his rank and what was his name. This Irishman said, "My name is Night before last, then night before that, last night and tonight and every other damn night is Micheal Murphy." That is the spirit that makes America, great and </seg>
            <seg id="p069">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE gives us all a common fellowship. I consider it a real honor to have served on this Board of Agriculture for the last seven years and hope to continue to do nW part in the upbuilding of this State. I know of no place that a man can serve in a better capacity than of a member of this Fair Association and upon the State Board of Agriculture which is not only advertising but building Nebraska. SECRETARY JACKSON: 1 1 will now introduce a man who went down with me to Dallas, Texas in October. We were down at the National Meeting of State Fairs for ten days. We were there on Confederate Day and we were there on Negro Day. On the latter day there were 70,000 people on the fairgrounds in Dallas and 60,000 were Negroes. We watched a train come in which brought 1500 of them and then we watched two old cronies meet. It seems that they had. lived together in the same neighborhood. Evidently one of them had . been away somewhere and he met this friend of his'n and said, "Rastus, has anything happened since I have been gone", and the reply was, "Nothing of any consequence. Oh yes, your dog died". "Did that dog die, how did that happen," and the other answered, "He burned to death." "Burned to death, how did that happen?" "He was locked up in that wood house and the wood house got afire and it burned the poor dog to death." "How did the wood house get on fire?" "Sparks". "Sparks from where?" "From the house". "Did the house burn too?" "Yes, the house burned too." "How did that happen?" "Your mother-in-law fell and knocked a candle off the table and set the blinds afire." "What was the matter with her?" "Shock". "What shock? Rastus, just tell me how it was." "When your wife ran away with that other negro the shock was too great for your mother-in-law and she fell over dead and knocked the candle off and the house got on fire and burned and set the shed on fire and your poor dog was burned to death". I introduce Charlie Graff. BY CHARLIE GRAFF. Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen, after listening to this program that has been given this evening and after hearing, the high-powered toastmaster and these high-power - ed orators and seeing the high-kicking girls, that seems to me we have hit about all the high spots on the program. I know you don't want me to talk Fair and you don't want any more Reminiscence. In fact you don't want to hear me, and I know you don't want me to make a talk on farm relief which is one thing I might be apt to talk about this evening; and which is something that I have a faint recol - lection that has been mentioned a few times in the past couple years in the middle section of this country. I think our country is rather overloaded with pessimists. Sometimes I think these pessimists have some cause. You know I don't like to meet many of my fellow '. * ■ . ■ \ . ■ ■ ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p070">RRI'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE men who have become so much in that frame of mind and so pessimistic that they make you think of the Arkansan's dog. A man traveled into this yard and while he was visiting with the Arkansan one of the dogs set up a howl that bothered them and as that dog kept up that mournful whine the visitor said, "What is the matter with your dog, and the other answered, "I guess he is setting on a burr again and he is too damn lazy to move". SECRETARY JACKSON: I guess Mr. A. H. Miller must have left when the j*irls did because this is the second time we have called for him. For our next speaker I am going to call on Irl Tolen, the flowery orator of our Board to talk for about five minutes. Irl is a highly educated man, like the gentleman who just left the floor. He has had an awful time getting an education. First he studied for the Ministry for four years and then failed for the want of religion. Then he studied for Law for four years and was admitted to the bar but it was too late for he found the State had gone dry. Now I am going to ask Irl Tolen to put the finishing touches on this evenings program. BY IRL D. TOLEN: Ladies and Gentlemen, after all of the eloquence has been displayed here this evening it is going to be a difficult matter for me to put the finishing touches on this meeting. I could not help but onjoy the remarks that our Toastmaster made with reference to our adventure in Chicago, but he did'nt tell it all. I am not going to do so either. We will just dismiss that part except I will admit it was true what he said. It is also true what he said about my early training and how I got my education. I am going to admit all of those things are true but I find myself just now a good deal in the position of a wonderful man who thought he had a definite call to go into the Ministry. He told his friends how he got that calling. He says you know one morning as I left the house to go out into the field, just as the sun was coming up over the horizon he saw in a large outline the three letters, G. P. C. I took that to mean Go, Preach Christ. But his friend said, "No, that wasn't what it meant. That meant Go Plow Corn". Now that is my calling. So I haven't any more suggestions to make tonight. SECRETARY JACKSON: I am glad we had this banquet tonight. I am sure we have enjoyed the whole program and that we appreci - ate having had such speakers as Tomsen, Mellor and the others. So now we will stand adjourned until tomorrow morning when the State Board of Agriculture will resume it's deliberations. </seg>

PURCELL, of Custer County: As we look back over the history of the State Board of Agriculture we find that some of the best and some of the ablest men in the State of Nebraska T^^Jf r Siti ° n and that * is due t0 the work of ««•« men that the State Board of Agriculture and the State Fair of Nebraska has attained and held the high position and exalted rank i n the Mate Fairs of this country, that it now holds and in looking over the. list I believe I can say that of all the men we have had in this position, there have -been none with greater ability than our present Secretary. He went on the Board I believe in 1911 and I went on the Board a year later and I have watched his splendid work durin K all of these years and I have felt that we owe to George Jackson a great deal of the success that the State Fair has met with and I want to at this time, and it is certainly a pleasure to now place in nomination GEORGE JACKSON as Secretary of this organization BY SENATOR PERRY REED: I second the nomination, and I 7oS wV a \ "V rSt introductions t° George Jackson came in JmLpK ft ° f thG H ° USe Of Representatives and somet mes there were laws upon which we were in agreement and now t. gives me no little satisfaction to see him Secretary of a body where he meets with us and doesn't have anything to say.

            <seg id="p078">UKI'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Is there any further business to come before this convention? BY CHARLES GRAFF: 1 can't help but ask for some little information as to how the different counties which hold their County Fairs just before the State Fairs are going to meet the situation. Of course, Merrick County held their Fair the week preceding the State Fair and I understand Thayer County also does. It has al - ways been difficult for Thayer County to get here in time to put in their exhibits in the Agricultural Hall owing to the fact that they have their Fair so very close to the State Fair. I would like to hear from some of these different counties as to how they are going to manage to get to the State Fair where they hold their Fair during the week previous, and now the State Fair starts in the end of. that week. BY E. J. MITCHELL, of Thayer County: As far as Thayer County is concerned, we got in the clear last year. We. moved up a week earlier, putting it in August; but Jefferson County took our former dates and their Secretary, Mr. Gilmore has been making an inquiry about that. BY MR. A. H. PIERSON, of Scotts Bluff County: The easiest way to solve that proposition is to have a Committee appointed to arrange your State Fair exhibit independent of your County Fair exhibits. The State Fair exhibits will then be sent forward on time without regard to the dates of this County Fair, for you can't show stock in two places at once. BY SECRETARY GEORGE JACKSON: I might say in regard to . ' this phase that the real Fair will not start until Saturday morning. We are charging admission on Friday in order to keep the young people of Lincoln out rather than charging to get them in. Our main program will start on Saturday. We want to dispose of the club work and the Lancaster County Fair on Saturday. We will expect all the club work to bo in here and placed Saturday morning by • eight o'clock. Thero are very few Fairs in the State that will ba affected by this. Thoso few which are in conflict and those who live a great ways off holding fairs the previous week can relieve the calves and other things that pertain to club work on Thursday night and send them to the Fair, as they do in other states. When it comes to some of the class stuff, we will have to give you time to come in with that. Iowa will not get in there until Sunday. If you make your entries before and get your class stock in here on Sunday, I think you will be in alright. All of the club stuff we are in hopes that you can release Thursday night so that they may be in here ready to go into the show ring Saturday and to have it be in good shape it is really desirable that it get in before. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE You know that our schools over the State generally start on the week that our Fair has been held. There hasn't been much over five per cent of the teachers who have had an opportunity to get to the State Fair, and many of the students have also been so deprived so we want the club work and things of that sort in here on Satur - day. I am sure this can be worked out, because this is no experiment. They have successfully conducted eight-day Fairs in the states around us. I think all of these States are having eight-day Fairs except possibly South Dakota. Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota all have eight-day Fairs, and it can be worked out here just as well as it can in these other states. We don't want to throw any handi - cap on anyone, but we feel that our crowds have increased so that we must expand. Any of yoli who were here last year on Monday can appreciate what I am saying. On that day it was impossible to see the exhibits. You could go wherever you wanted to i\) the buildings and you couldn't gk within twenty feet of most of the exhibits, and most of those who attend the Fair want to see those things and many who came on Monday last year did not feel like they could come again, and w| cannot blame them if they went home disgusted resolving never to come back because I doubt if anyone saw much of anything at. all except people. I felt rather disgusted myself when I saw such a crowd and knew that we were not taking care of them and we could not do so with our facilities. So we must expand and I hope the County Fairs of the State of Nebraska will join in this with a spirit of . cooperation and I know you will and that will help us out with this eight-day Fair. Are there any other questions that you would like to ask? BY VICE PRESIDENT WEAVER: I am sure the Secretary of this organization and the Board of Managers will cooperate with you to meet this situation and help any County Fairs make any arrange - ments within reason which will provide for getting in their exhibits. BY MR. T. B. JCEEDLE, of Kearney County: I will make a mo - tion that this matter be left with the Board of Managers. I have every confidence in their handling it. I can say this as an exhibitor at this State Fair for over thirty years and I believe the Board of Managers can. handle it better than we can ourselves at this meeting. Motion seconded.' ■ BY VICE PRESIDENT WEAVER: You have heard the motion. Are there any remarks on motion made that this matter be referred to the Board of Managers? BY MR. CHARLES GRAU, of Douglas County: I think, Mr. Chairman, that this motion is in order, but the motion might have </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE been extended a little. It is all a matter of cooperation, men, be - tween the officers of those County Pairs that are holding their Fairs the week prior to the State Fair. I know that it can be worked out satisfactorily to the management of those County Fairs and the State Board of Agriculture. I was looking for our Secretary and 1 do not see him just now. You know when we organized our County Agricultural Society w ( - ha.l in mind that it would be to our advantage as well as to the State Fair to set our dates the week prior to the dates of the Ne - braska State Fair. We have carried that out ever since. We find ■t is very convenient. We find that our exhibitors who exhibit at our County Fair wish to come on down to the State Fair and they are given the privilege of being released earlier wherever the dr- ■ cumstances require in order to get their exhibits into the State Fair in time. It is just a matter of a little cooperation with those County Fa.rs and with the State Board where the Counties hold their Fair just the week prior to the Nebraska State Fair. You notice it is generally said that the Nebraska State Fair is held during the first week in September. That means that the big end of the State Fair will be in the first week in September We have our County Fair designated for the last week in August. We may some times run over a day or so in September or the State Fa,r sometimes runs a little further along in the month and some - tim.-s has opened before the first day of September. It is all a matter to be worked out by those who hold their Fairs the week prior to the State Fair and I know there will be no difficuty in anyone getting their stuff from the County Fairs to the State Fair, who want the opportunity of having their livestock or exhibits go on to the State Fair. You can arrange to release them in sufficient tirce to be on the State Fair Grounds on Saturday morning. BY VICK PRESIDENT WEAVER: Are there any other remarks? I am sure the Board of Managers and the Secretary in particular will be glad to assist in any way possible to work out this problem. BY MR. GRAU: I would suggest relative to Class F, Farm Pro - ducts that w P get out an advance sheet. It has been my experience ever since 18% when I started in as an exhibitor in collections of exhibits that it is very material to get an advance sheet out by April 1. I hope the management will see it's way clear to have that advance sheet gotten out and in the hands of the prospective exhibitor «» Apr,] ] , n order to make the Agricultural exhibits a success. BY VICE PRESIDENT WEAVER: I wish to ask if there are any further remarks on the motion which is before the House, which </seg>

It may be necessary to get their cooperation to change their schedules in order to get the exhibits in here for Saturday morning you want to pet them in in time for your animals to rest, for those in the club class should have some rest the same as those in the other classes. The boys and girls come here with their ani - mals ready for the judging on Saturday morning and they should not arrive with them, if possible, to avoid it not later than Friday night because the stuff is going to be droopy if it does. We want to do everything we can to help make the boys and girls club class an out - standing success just as it was last year. BY SECRETARY JACKSON: There is one matter that is very important to our office. We seem to have an awful time getting the datt-s for the County Fairs. I don't know whether your Fair thinks it is not important that we know its dates. I wonder how many of you men would promise me now, if we haven't already secured your ilate.s send them in to our office in the next ten days. "Liberal shc« of hands in response". BY VICE PRESIDENT WEAVER: I would suggest that any members who know the dates of their County Fair for this year shoulil report that to the Secretary before leaving. I.s there any other business to come before this convention? If not, 1 would like to report that the President of this Association, while he cannot be here this morning, has reported to the Secretary his selections for membership of the Board of Managers for the en - suing year; so I hereby announce that the President has so appointed: PERRY REED, Hamilton County.

Members of the Association and fellow Fanners: . As your President and in accordance with a self-imposed policy I have taken the trouble to very briefly work out a summary of the work of the Society for the past year, and intend to read it into the record so that our absent members may be informed of what we have done, and also that it may serve as a guide to those who shall have the planning of the future fields of activity for this Society. This move seems to justify itself, and I trust that it will become a custom which will be followed by the officers who take my place. According to custom, the Secretary-Trea - surer, Mr. Paul H. Stewart, has compiled and edited the report for the year 1927 covering the annual meeting last January, and reciting the activities of the Society throughout the year. The same has been printed and forwarded to .HfV, «, v* * J . His Excellenc y- the Governor, m compliance with the statute and to all members of this association. Our long time program has suffered little change. The fourtV annual ten-acre corn yield contest has been carried out. as a state pro - ject and the report will be found m the proceedings of this meeting already referred to. A similar wheat yield contest was carried on this As has been done m the past, an annual Corn and Small Grain show was conducted at the College of Agriculture at the time of the winter meeting m January of 1927. Though the holding of such an exhibit with its attendant expense to the Society has been fruitful of much discu SslO n there has been comparatively little interest shown, and it i ff thought that unless some scheme can be worked out by the site n r £ v and itS PTOducts beyond the limits of the «»i i Stafe COm Yidd C ° nteSt haS met tt such uniform success, and the lessons taught and information derived has been of such high </seg>
            <seg id="p112">SPORT OF NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OK AOKICL'LTITRK standing, it has been suggested that a county contest in the several counties of the state which grow corn as a major crop, might lead to further bringing home of desired information to the several localities. To this end Douglas County has sponsored, through the cooperation of the Crop Growers, the local Farm Bureau, and the Extension Service, a county contest participated in by some 25 fanners, suitable prizes having been furnished by the International Harvester Co., the John Deere Plow Co., the Rock Island Plow Co., and the Iininger Implement House, recognition of which generosity is made at this time. Should this county contest prove a success, it is possible that similar contests. will be arranged in quite a number of corn-growing counties in the state, and all headed up by the Crop Growers in a State Contest. This year has seen a marked advance in seed certification work, a detailed report of which will be presented at this meeting. For the first time, a sales tax on the sales made by members has been self - imposed, with the gratifying result that we now have some money in the treasury which we have earned ourselves and it is hoped that we will soon be growing to a point where we can handle the certification work as an association project, being wholly self-supporting. This year wo have had a certification committee appointed and functioning in the preparation of sales material, such as bags and tags, which committee has functioned in passing on the threshed samples of grain submitted by the members, and an advertising campaign is under consideration. Along this same line we have received the generous cooperation of three seed houses, one in Beatrice, and two in Lincoln, who are handling the recognized certified product of the Crop Growers members, to their mutual advantage. The outstanding single piece of educational seed work in which the Society has been active this year, was in giving cooperation to the Burlington Railway and the Omaha Grain Exchange when they con - ducted a special demonstration train through the wheat-growing section of and adjoining southwestern Nebraska. A step in advance was made when the Society undertook the cer - tify'ng; of alfalfa and sweet clover seeds produced in western Nebraska, where a separate marketing Society has been organized, which will receive our support. Your Secretary has attended the conferences of the International Crop Improvement Association at Chicago, the Seed Marketing Con - ference, and the second annual meeting of the Western Nebraska Organized Agriculture, where assistance was given in furnishing material for a program. The Society has enjoyed a substantial increase in membership, and we believe is in position to go forward to another year with an increased budget, due to our own activities. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION THE VALUE OF COST ACCOUNTS FOR THE FARM Mason Yerkes — Rural Economics Dept. ; In the lime allotted to me I should like to bring out what, if any, is the value of knowing the "Costs of Production." In order to ex - plain clearly what is meant by costs of production an indication of } those items entering into the costs will serve our purpose better than a formal definition. The different costs could be divided into two parts; those costs that must be met each year or the overhead or direct costs, and those costs that may be carried over but eventually have to be met. These might be termed fixed costs. Under the first group would come such costs as: I Cash rent (if cash rent is paid) ! Man Labor Horse labor (feed) Machinery costs ( does not include depreciation) Seed Interest on borrowed capital. Under the second group would come such items as: Depreciation ■ . , . Interest on Investment ■ '.■:■ Labor Income (of fanner himself). ■ All of the above costs must at some time be considered in the production of crops or of live stock before one can really say that a profit has been made. The question that comes in here is, supposing we do find out what it. costs us to produce our crops or our live Stock, of what value is it since we sell on an open market and take the price offered at that time ? USING PRODUCTION COST FIGURES It seems to me that there are two ways in which a knowledge of the costs of production would pay. The first, and for the individual fanner probably the most im - portant is in guiding him to more efficient production and second, to aid him in determining whether to curtail or increase his production of a particular product. There is always a great deal being said about curtailing production in order to boost prices, and we know it is a most usual procedure to curtail production when prices are low and to increase production when prices are high. , If a crop can be sold for enough to cover the "direct charges", that is those costs which are still optional at the time the fanner decides if. ... .how much to plant, the crop is worth raising; if the crop cannot be i ■■'■■■'.• • ' '■ I ,- ■ ■ ■ . i " : '• ■-'■ .

            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sold for enough to cover these costs, the operation is unprofitable. However, even when prices are lowest a farmer can rarely make a net saving by curtailing his individual output. This fact arises from the peculiar character of farm expenses. In most types of farming the direct expenses, that is those which vary with the volume of produc - tion constitute a relatively small part of the total cost and of the value of the product even during: years of low prices. Where as it would seldom pay the individual farmer to curtail his production of a certain crop, it is quit-* possible that a certain locality *&gt;r part of the state or country would be better off by curtailing or • discontinuing entirely that crop The main reason for so doing would be because some other section of the state or country can pro - ducp the crop in question in greater quantities at a less price due largely to the natural or inherent resources of that locality. A two - fold advantage results, less of the crop may be grown resulting in a better price to those farmers growing the crop, and the substitution of a . more profitable product in the first locality.

            <seg id="p115">NEBRASKA' CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ■ Observation of the chart shows the average yields and costs for Eastern Nebraska, for Fillmore County, and for Perkins county which is typical of Western Nebraska. This chart gives an advantage to Pill - more county over Eastern Nebraska and a very decided advantage to ■ Perkins county over Eastern Nebraska, which includes Fillmore county. This advantage is largely due to the inherent resources of the waste as far as the growing of wheat is concerned. The size of the farm ' in the west gives opportunity for larger and more efficient machinery. However, the opportunities for substitution of one crop for another are limited. Alternative crops or products may not be readily avail - able. i^HKSMHif^^BBffj'^?^ r^^^^^^HT*^^f^^^E&gt;_ *jru5jflLU^^^St^^^3fl^g * Fis. 3 — Time spent on tours studying the records - and methods of various farmers pays good returns.

Crops or products that might be substituted have already been eliminated on account of soil, climate, insects, disease, or transportation costs. i Again the prices of substitute products may have so declined that there is no advantage in changing. Finally, changes are costly. If a farm has been organized for a certain type of production, it may 1 be unwise to buy new equipment, change the cropping system, or </seg>

If the possibility of substituting one product for another, or changing the cropping system is out of the question, then there comes the greater possibility of using cost of production figures, such as these, to bring greater efficiency in producing the products already being grown. CORN PRODUCTION COSTS Reference to Table II on Cost of Producing Corn in Nebraska shows a wide range in costs of production, even when each section of the state is considered by itself. A big difference, though not so extreme, would be found in acre costs, which perhaps gives a more accurate picture of conditions. The lower costs do not always mean the greater profits, as in a number of instances, these low costs were obtained by shotgun methods of planting and growing, the low yield received counteracting any advantage in low costs of production.

We will not go into detail regarding the cost of producing corn as this tropic will be considered by Mr. Stewart tomorrow at the Crop Growers' Meeting when he will discuss the results of the 10 Acre Corn Con - test. Mr. Stewart is going to bring out some valuable and interest- j ing points on the growing of corn which will be well worth your time I to hear. This last chart on the 1927 Pig Crop Contest will best bring out I the difference in efficiency of methods on the individual farms, the ) most valuable use, it seems to me, that cost records could be put to. OBSERVATION OF 1927 PIG CROP CONTEST \ Noting Table III on the Pig Crop Contest we see that the average ,! feed and labor cost amounted to $6.45 per hundred weight. Studies made in Iowa and Illinois indicate that additional charges would bring the total cost around $7.55 in 1927 for this same group of men. It A </seg>
            <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION' must be remembered that the men in the contest represent some of the best hog men in the state and for that reason their costs would be lower than the average of the state. These men raised an average of 6 pigs per litter whereas the average of the state is slightly under five. • Comparisons may be made as to the men in the contest. The eleven men that qualified by raising 1200 pounds or more of pork per litter did so with a feed and labor cost of $5.86. The feed and labor cost of the men who fell below the 1200 pound mark was $6.88. The five low men of the latter group paid a feed and labor bill of $8.39 or $2.53 more than the eleven high men. As we compare the five low men with the eleven high men we see that the number of pigs farrowed per sow was seven against nine and the number of pigs raised -was 4.3 against 7. In other words two less pigs were far- * rowed on the five low farms and one more was lost in the raising. When one sees that the eleven high men averaged approximately 900 pounds more weight per litter than did the low five men and 500 pounds more per litter than the 26 that fell below 1200 pounds, it is readily understood that some of these 37 men are not going to make a profit from their pigs. I If nothing else, this contest has shown that large litters must be raised and these litters must make a fast economical growth if there is going to be any profit in pork production. This is even more true in a. year such as 1927 has been and the greater part of 1928 will be. In summary, there are two possible uses of farm cost records. First, to determine whether or not to. curtail or increase production. The desirability of curtailing production is questioned especially if direct charges can be met. Short time changes in agricultural produc - tion are- due largely to forces of nature. Due to the dominant part played by the forces of nature, it would probably be inadvisable to try to. adjust farm organization to meet change in price relationship for one particular year. The very character of the farm business prevents prompt adjustment. Second, to determine the efficiency of our methods of production and where, if possible, changes may be made to bring greater profits from our products. Mr. Waggoner of the Animal Husbandry Department will discuss the Pig Crop Contest as will also a number of the men who partici - pated in the contest. They will explain the methods they followed. Their methods were not all similar if one may judge from their re - ports, but all of them 'produced pork efficiently and at a reasonable cost. * - .. </seg>
            <seg id="p118">RKI'oHT OF NF.URASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . In conclusion, 1 believe it is safe to say that in planning the organization of any farm, the first step would be to produce as much of the dominant crop as is consistent with good farm practices in that community, then choose the kinds and quantities of other crops . . and live stock that will make the best use of time and equipment when they are not needed for the major enterprise.

PRESIDENT .MAGEE: I think, that I express the sentiment of the organization when I say that we most sincerely thank Mr. Yerkes for coming before us and giving this most excellent presentation of a subject which should be very close to our hearts even if it is not. While listening to his remarks I got to harking back to my own experiences when I first went onto a farm, and to the information given me at that time. I was city trained and my old father sent me out onto a farm in Nebraska, and he said something like this: "Now remember, it is the difference between what you make and what you spend that will tell the story of your success." But the ; man who will take to heart the story we have heard this morning will not have as great a handicap as I had. The next speaker has been specially trained. He was for several years a farmer then he became a County Agent in Phelps County. H ■ latrr wont back to the farm. He has just lately been elected pi'sidpnt of h!s c&lt;w~'y f."-" - 'vi-cau.

Gilmore, Valley, Nebraska . ■ . ■ ■ Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: I can assure y.ou it is no easy task for -me to stand before this audience. I can assure yfcu also that I would .feel more at ease were I at home at ■ work among my livestock. I have witnessed small boys and girls standing before large audiences and giving their demonstra - tions, and I have been conscious of the fact that those boys and girls in the 4-H Club work were receiving valuable training for the years to come; for it inculcates into the youngsters the ability to stand be- . fore his fellows and voice what is in. his mind. I am thoroughly in sympathy with the club work and wish every boy and girl could re - ceive this training, in the 4-H clubs, being taught as I believe Dr. Holland has said, "the dignity and beauty of farm life as we of the older generation were not." The chairman told you I was to discuss as my subject this morn - ing, "How Farm Records have Influenced My Farm Practices." It has been our custom — I might almost say habit, during the past several years, — to jot down bits of information relative to our farm business. These bits of information might be referred to as livestock records, selection of seed corn or ear type records, and so on. Speaking of the selection of seed corn, I might say in this connection, that we had a very interesting' study during the past year in that line. We had growing in one field, under identical cultural and soil conditions, several varieties of corn, some from. Ohio, some home grown, and some hybrid seed corn. I can assure you that when we made comparisons of ear types and performances it is indeed , interestisg. I have been asked if it would be wise for farmers generally to send off for hybrid I, seed corn for field planting. With the information in my possession I hesitate to make a statement on that subject; but I do feel that if a farmer will go into his own field, or into his neighbor's field, and select a medium length ear, of about 16 rows, and will plant that corn, he will not be disappointed with his crop in-so-far as the selection of seed corn influences his yield. Of course there are many other fac - tors which enter into this matter of yield. Inasmuch as the material which I propose presenting this morning is largely statistical in nature I have thought perhaps you could bet - ter visualize the idea I wish to get across if I present it in chart form; and in following the discussion you need not then carry in your head all of the several figures which might be presented. :•■■)•■ ■ £■'■■•'■ ■■.'■■■ ' : . ■■.'-:■ '•.:•■.".■ • "■ . ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p120">RKJ'ORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the selection of these records I have chosen that of crop pro - duction as perhaps being the best fitted to illustrate the point we have at hand. I believe these records, if kept and studied and analyz - ed by the farmer would be a means with him, as they have in my case, of influencing his future practices.

Records of course become more valuable throughout the years in which they are kept; the longer the record the more valuable it s. I find that the ■•:• longer we keep records the more determined we are to continue to keep them and to make use of them. j I might say we had no very definite plan for crop rotation pre - ceedins: 1920. We did plant certain acreages of alfalfa and red clover what may account for the higher yields, where corn was grown con - tinuously, than recent years have produced. As shown in the first column of the table the yields of continuous corn for the 8 year period of 1920—27 were 60, 52, 45, 38, 30, 35, 36, and 34 bushels per acre or an average of 42.5 bushels. It is interesting to guess as to where the yields would go in future years with corn planted on the field each year. My records on the first year of corn following a legume where crop begins in 1925 and show yields of 91.5, 76.0 and 70 bushels per ! acre or an average of 79 bushels. Where corn is continued for two years making 2 years of corn following a legume I got my first record in 1926 having yields of 59 and 54 bushels or an average of </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION I « 66.5 bushels per acre. As an average of 1926 and 1927 we had 137.5 pounds of clean Hubam sweet clover. This is from the 2 year rota- ■ tion where Hubam is seeded with oats and cut for seed in the fall. . ■■■'■ 1 - ' ■ - ' Fig. 4— John Gilmore fn a patch of Hubam sweet clover ■ ! A field of alfalfa seeded in 1919 was plowed up together with a field of red. clover in 1925 and planted to corn making a yield of 91.5 bushels. Table IV brings out in a very striking way the close relation between yields and high fertility due to legume crops. Returns from Various Cropping- Systems Now a word as to the returns from the various rotations. These returns are figured with corn at 65 cents per bushel, oats at 40 cents per bushel, sweet clover hay at 38.00 per ton, Hubam clover seed at $20.00 per cwt .and alfalfa hay at $12.00 per ton. If we stop with the i ■ figures on crop yields, without analyzing them they would be of very | little use. The thing to do is to study the records and determine as to whether or riot they might be of assistance to us in developing bet - ter farm practices than have prevailed in the past. We have tried to take several different slants at the problem. In the five year rotation alfalfa was used as the legume making one year of- oats — three of alfalfa and one of corn. By adding the yearly yields multiplied by their value we get an annual average gross acre return of $35.91 for the 5 year period. That would repre - | sent 20 percent of the acreage in corn, 20 percent in oats and 60 per cent in alfalfa. Let us now consider the 3 year rotation, to determine if that - might not be more profitable, wherein we used Hubam clover as the legume rather than alfalfa. In that instance we would have a crop of oats with which Hubam clover is seeded and produces a crop of i -'-I? .- v ■ ■ : : : 1- </seg>
            <seg id="p122">RKl'URT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE : seed in the fall. This would make a gross return of $47.74 for the clover and oats. Then we have 2 years of corn averaging 79 bushels. Figuring the annual gross return per acre we have $45.27 or a cash return of practically $10.00 better than was secured from the 5 year rotation. The 3 year rotation would also permit us to have a better distribution of our labor as we found we could plow the Hubam sweet clover land in the fall which we could not do with the biennial sweet clover. In the two year rotation we again used Hubam clover as the legume. The first year we have oats and Hubam clover seed which as we figured before has given us an annual gross return of $49.54 per acre. By alternating our fields having half of our acreage in .corn and half in oats and Hubam each year, we would practically double the amount of corn that could be grown. By this system we can get as many total bushels of corn from half our land as we would get ■ with all our acreage in corn continuously. You will notice that we do not raise wheat; we have not grown it for nearly 20 years. We can not compete with western Nebraska and other sections on wheat. I do not know that there is anything further which I can deduct from these records. If there is anything I have not made clear I will be very glad to try to answer any questions. QUESTION: Will you please explain again just what you mean by a five year and two year rotation? MR. GILMORE: The five year rotation does not mean 5 years in corn and 5 years in some other crop; that means 1 year in oats, 3 in alfalfa, and then one year in corn. The two-year rotation is one which we have adopted now of using oats as the nurse crop for the Hubam clover and plowing the clover stubble under in the fall and putting it into corn the following year. This simply alternates the fields. We find that under this plan we can grow as much corn as if we had a continuous crop, and have the clover and oat crops besides. In the two year rotation you have 100 per cent of your acreage pro - ducing grain that is corn and oats, 50 per cent of it producing corn annually. In the Hubam clover the straw is a valuable roughage for stock cattle. I would not recommend it for dairy feed, although the cattle do like to stick around it. It stays just as green and nice as the day it was cut. There is no dust and it makes real nice feed. All the fine stuff is there, but it is separated and knocked off of the straw. </seg>

MR. GILMORE: When I cut the Hubam clover depends ver&gt; ) much on the season. I have tried cutting it on the 20th of Septem- * I • ber, and have cut it from then to the last of September or the first ; of October, I feel sure I would have obtained more seed this year if it had been let. stand a week longer than it did. I lost I am sure 50 per cent of the seed because we could not get the threshing ma - chine just when we wished it, and the weather continued dry and the shucks got so dry that when you raised them the heavy seed just rained out on you; and we thought then that in the future we would let it stand in the shuck and become wilted, and stack it in not too large stacks, and then thresh it when our fall work was done. In that way we would more quickly get it off the ground and get to plowing, and perhaps save more of the . seed. We cut it with a binder. It is more easily shocked than any small grain and you can set it up easier, and then any amount of rain doesn't seem to fease it. It sheds rain better than any other grain I have ever had any - thing to do with. . I | QUESTION: Do you always get perfect stands of Hubam when seeding with oats? MR. GILMORE: These figures do not necessarily represent a perfect stand. In 1925 we had an ideal year, with seasonable rains and everything perfect. 1926 was somewhat dryer. I think we got a little less hay that year, and this year we didn't have any rain at all and we won't get three-quarters of a ton crop of clover hay.

            <seg id="p124">KKPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and it comes along about the first of May it is a real drag. Fall plowing works in better with our labor; ours being a one-man farm whire we have to watch the labor distribution pretty closely. I think it would be true of this crop, as of all other crops, that there are seasons when it is a question how far the crop will get; if we had had frost at the seasonable time this year there is a lot of corn that would not have matured. But if I had Hubam clover the ground would certainly be plowed in the fall. If one thought he wasn't go - ing to get a crop he could plow it all under and he would certainly have a crop of humus that would be valuable. QUESTION: What about Hubam clover for pasture? MR. GIJ-.MORE: I have not had much experience in letting stock run on HubW but I had one field in which the stock run shortly af - ter we cut it, and they kept in excellent condition. I think it would make good pasture. In using oats I have been in the habit of cutting the stalks with a stalk cutter and discing the ground thoroughly, and then I t\rzg it down and seed the Hubam with a broadcasting seeder — one of those long- box seeders. We have wished we had a roller or packer to use following that. QUESTION: Does Hubam make more than the biennial sweet clover ? MR. GILMORE: In the two year rotation at the present prices of seed and sweet clover hay there would be a decided advantage in favor of Hubam over sweet clover for seed for a cash return. We do not raise any biennial sweet clover for seed. I can't see how I can afford to let biennial sweet clover occupy ground when I can get several times as much per pound for this kind of clover. I have never permitted biennial sweet clover to occupy ground the sec- ' oncl year. I always plowed it up from the first to the tenth of MaJ and put it in com because I thought the com' crop would be more valuable than the sweet clover. Due to taxes and other things it is necessary for me to realize some cash crop from my farm each year, and by this method I be - lieve 1 can do that and maintain my fertility, and even increase it materially. 1 believe we have permitted this discussion to drift over into a discussion of rotation of crops rather than the primary object, which was farm records. I didn't have in mind the presentation of a crop rotation that would be acceptable to everybody. We must determine from our records the best practice on our own farms. QUESTION: In plowing biennial sweet clover under the fore part of May what soil benefit does one get? </seg>
            <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA CROP GKOWERS' ASSOCIATION - MR.. GILMORE : I am going to ask Mr. Stewart to answer that. MR. P. H. STEWART: It is difficult to get an exact measurement of soil improvement by handling sweet clover in various ways. In general however we believe, basing our ideas on practical farm ex - perience as well as station experiments, that biennial sweet clover plowed under the forepart of May when 10 to 12 inches high will add to the soil from 60 to 70 per cent of the nitrogen that would be se - . cured by leaving the crop the full two years. One does not get, however, that loosening and pulverizing of the soil secured by leav - ing the crop the full two years. I want to say a word "about Hubam in comparison with biennial sweet clover. Mr. Gilmore has painted a very rosy picture of the profits from Hubam clover. For his conditions Hubam is an excel - lent crop and Mr. Gilmore is to be congratulated for having studied his conditions in such a careful way as to determine the fitness of his farm to this crop. We must remember, however that Mr. Gilmore is located on very productive, sub-irrigated Platte valley land where he can do things that men on average eastern Nebraska land cannot hope to do, For average conditions the biennial varieties are likely to be more profitable. Moreover if many go to producing Hubam seed the price will fall to the level of ordinary seed. Mr. Gilmore has a very fine system but I doubt if it is one that many others can apply to their conditions. HOW I USE MY FARM RECORD BOOK ED JOCHIM, Weeping Water MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN: ' I have been asked to give you a talk on my record book and will try to do so although this is my first attempt before the public. The figures given are for the most part from my records for 1926. I have been operating a 240 acre farm up until 1927. I bought 240 acres in the fall of . 1926 that adjoined my present farm. As I already have a heavy investment in&lt; machinery I believe that I will be able to take care of the additional 240 acres by adding another tractor to my equipment. I generally have 100 acres in corn, 25 acres in wheat, 25 acres In oats, and about 20-25 acres in alfalfa, the balance in wild hay and pasture. The field work, with the exception of plowing, is done with horses. Twenty -to 25 brood sows are usually bred to farrow in the . spring! and a smaller number of brood sows are bred back for fall </seg>
            <seg id="p126">EI'OKT i IF NKHRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE j farrowing. All pigs are vaccinated against the cholera. I always plan on hogging down 25-40 acres of corn in the fall. As I have my own truck, I haul most of my hogs to market. In 1926 I fed 100 head of cattle. Some of the cattle were pur - chased from the neighbors but most of them were bought on the mar - ket. I always feed all of the grain raised and often have to buy- more. All grain is ground. Our records show that marketing the grain thru livestock is more profitable than selling the grain direct. We are also able to help keep up the fertility of the land through the. addition of fpou;'h manure each year to cover twenty acres or better. Aside from the income from grain and stock sales in 1926, we re- I vi ived a total of $756.29 from poultry, eggs, and cream, Such an ! amount goes a long way towards keeping the home and is an important and regular source of income every year. All the sales from poultry, epgs, and cream are handled by my wife. She keeps a flock of white i rock chickens of between 200-300 each year and I milk four or live • cows. From the same source my wife will receive $846.25 for 1927. One should remember that these sales are in addition to having all we can use of butter, poultry, eggs, and milk for ourselves. As I have my own threshing rig and corn sheller I am able to thresh or shell whenever the time is suitable. Not only that but most of my miscellaneous receipts of $687.98 in 1926 were from threshing, shelling, and trucking. For 1927 the same sources will bring in $673.91. According to my records my farm is valued at $48,000. The total ■ investment comes to $62,700 of which $7000 is invested in machinery, ) not including the automobile; approximately $5800 in farm buildings which does not include an all-modern farm home built in 1921 a • picture of which was shown in the December 31, 1927 issue of the Nebraska Farmer. The buildings include two cow barns, both having ! cement floors, and with a capacity to store and feed practically all the • hay necessary during the winter months. Good fences of hedge posts and woven wire have saved both time and trouble. Summarization of my records from 1923-1926 show me that a com - bination of legumes and livestock brings the most profit; that poultry and dairy products the farming minor sources of income are regular and should be considered on every farm; that good improvements well kept are a profitable investment. I had a labor income of $2135.00 \ in 1926 after paying 5 per cent on an investment of $62,700, and will ! have approximately $2900 in 1927 after paying interest at 5 per cent on $103,000. ■ </seg>

REl'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FARM MANAGEMENT FACTS FROM CASS COUNTY L. R. Snipes County Agent — Cass County Mr. Chairman: From Mr. Yerkes Cost Records a farmer in Eastern Nebraska that makes a living could do well in Western Nebraska. Abe Martin says, "A few farmers made money during the last few years because they rented their farm buildings to manufacturers who placed on them cigarette advertisements. The manufacturer made money because he placed his advertisement where the people could see it, and he knew it." This same statement is true of a f( w farmers who kept farm records. They made money and they knew they did because they kept a record of all expenses and receipts, and took a beginning and closing inventory. In the same precinct, equally' equipped, one man made a net profit of $4,500, and the other a net loss of $5,150 m 1926. How could you find where the one made the profit and the other a loss if :hey had not kept a record of their farm busi - ness. For 5 years we have made a summary of from 19 to 47 farm records books kept by Cass county farmers -and 10 of these men have kept records 5 consecutive years. We compare the 5 most profitable, the average, and the 5 least profitable. Never, during the 5 years, has the farmer who comes m the class of straight grain farmer been m the 5 most profitable. The men who are classed as a livestock and grain farmer have always made up the 5 most profitable ones, and two men have been m the 5 most profitable every year of the five. For the year 1926 we compared the 10 most profitable, tbe average, and the 10 least profitable farms. </seg>

The ten high men have more than three times the receipts (with inventory changes) then do the ten. lowest farms. Although trebling the receipts the high ten had but $1217 more expense or 50 per cent more than the expense of the low ten farms. An important conclusion can be arrived at here. Almost any farm is going to have a certain amount of expense. This means then that as the receipts become . larger the expenses will he smaller in proportion. As a result every fanner should try to in - crease his sales from various sources. The item "Expenses per $100 Gross Income" may make our previous statement clearer. For every $100 taken in the ten high men had $47 expense while the ten low men had $104 expense on every $100 income, or were actually losing money on their operations. Two specific examples came Tip this year in our county. Two men who have been farming eighty acres each rented additional eighties for 1928. They will be able to farm this addi - tional ground without much more expense. We have said that never in the 5 years has a farmer classed as a • straight-grain fanner been among the most profitable group. Note ' the fact as shown by the table that the ten highest men have twice the number of productive animal units per farm; that their receipts | per unit are almost twice as high. Note the return per $100 invested I in cattle, swine, poultry. One of the best indications of success on the ! farm comes from the returns per $100 feed fed. There is a difference of $114 between the two groups. Again under the item "Important Sources of Income" the high group shows three sources against the two of the lower group. The men in the high group are keeping in .; mind that they must have something to sell. I ■ . .. " • ■ - ' 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p130">Ittil'DRT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sales on the ten high farms comes from livestock and their products. This is ten per cent more than the average on the ten poorest farms. If we had the time we might show that without a single exception the crop returns per acre were the highest on the ten best farms. The last item in the table, "Per cent of Crop Acres in Alfalfa and Clovers", shows the ten lowest farms with a larger per cent of alfalfa and clover. This is the first year of the five that such has been the case, and if these figures are correct you will find these men having large crop returns, coming farther up the scale on income and leaving the ten lowest places for those who raise neither legumes or live stock. HOW TO GET FARMERS TO "KEEP FARM RECORDS Based on these studies the following extension program for the county was adopted in an effort to increase the net profits of every Cass county farm. 1. Increase the acreage of legume crops. 2. Control erosion by the use of soil saving dams, brush dams, and terraces. 3. One hundred Farm Records for Cass County in 1927. 4. Make the use of legume crops as soil builders more common practice. 5. Promote the keeping of more livestock so as to market crop products in the form of meat, eggs, and milk. 6. Return to the land all of the manure available. 7. Keep records on individual farms to show in dollars what cer - tain methods of management return the operator. 102 farmers began to keep farm record books during January, 1927. Of these men 75 will finish their records complete for 1927. These men will know exactly where they stand and will be the larmers who • , will actively encourage the extension program for Cass County. QUESTION— Were the ones who made the profit located on valley land, or pretty well distributed? ANSWER— I think more valley land. QUESTION— What size were those farms? ANSWER— Around 250 acres; Those who made the least had 257 and the most successful one had 248 acres. ! QUESTION— 1 was wondering if the poorer farms didn't have some acres in legume for several years in succession. . ■ • ! </seg>
            <seg id="p131">. . "NEBRASKA CHOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION' ANSWER— Lately they have been sowing some in legumes, but . : . not enough to let the land build up. QUESTION— Was the cost of investment the same in all these farms? ANSWER — It runs pretty much the same;, in the last two years more than ever before. The men on the less profitable farms get a less yield perhaps. I don't see why those farms could not be taken and made to yield as well as the others, but it will take time to build them up. Mr. Jockim's farm has never been let to run down, and never" will, the way he handles it. QUESTION— Wouldn't that depend on what kind of a farmer a man is? One year a man might make money -on hogs and lose on cattle, and another year it. would be the reverse. . - I , ANSWER— Yes, that might be true. FARM ORGANIZATION FOR PROFIT. PROF. A. W. MEDLAR, Rural Economics Farm Organization is the science of the organization, operation and management of the various farm enterprises constituting the farm , business for the purpose of securing the greatest continuous profits. This definition assumes that we, are acquainted with the economic laws which operate in the field of farming. We speak of the law of supply and demand and of the law of increasing costs or diminishing returns and then sometimes fail to see' just how these are operating in farm business. We study the business cycle, the cycles of production, the corn and hog ratio and many of the other economic factors which are the results of. the activities of all farmers. Then the farmer sets himself to the task of organizing a business from which he may be able to- pay operating expenses, including a fair interest on his capital, a reasonable wage for his labor,' and a profit for his managerial ability. With these fundamentals as a background we may proceed to discuss the question before us. It is clear that we are discussing the business of farming and not the standards of rural life. An Iowa fanner puts | this distinction very aptly in a letter in Wallaces' Farmer of December , 23 when he says, "What I mean is, that a man may be a good farmer and yet put his crops and money to such a poor use that he eventu - , ' ally becomes a financial failure." I </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OP' NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Basic Principles for Farm Profit. . j Most profitable farm businesses must be built up on natural or economic advantages if they are to succeed. However, to these two factors must be added the desires of the individual farmer and his fitness for special lines of production. Professor Warren of Cornell has said that most fanners like to milk cows because there is a profit made by milking which could not be made without milking. Perhaps some farmers in your neighborhood milk for the joy of milking or because their neighbors do, but most of them are milking in order to add to the profits of the farm. There are ten basic principles which are observed by most successful fanners which are listed by the Bureau of Farm Management. 1. Profitableness as determined by general and local expenses. 2. The extent and distribution of enterprises. (This has much to do with the stability of supply and demand). 3. Location with reference to markets. 4. Conditions existing at market centers. 5. Soil and climatic conditions. 6. Cost of equipment required. 7. Amount and character of work required. 8. Seasonal distribution of labor. 9. Extent and possible market for the product and the probable effect of a considerable increase in the supply of the product. 10. Effect of the enterprise on the fertility of the soil. It will be readily observed that these ten principles are applied j differently by different men in the same community and by different men in different communities. And it will further be observed that when farmers in a given locality try to farm the same they obtain :• very different results. An illustration may be taken from twelve farms out of a group of 59 farms in Middlesex county, Mass, as sb^wn by the following table: Capital Acres Orchard Cows Farm Labor Income Income 7 best $17,916 114 10 Acres 16 $2,793 $1,897 j 5 poorest 18,945 125 7 " 22 -1,802 : 2,750 The best group received 49 per cent of their income from milk and 51 per cent fiwm apples, while the poorest group received 61 per cent . from milk and 8 per cent from apples. This evidently means that </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 . ASSOCIATION some of these farmers were exceedingly poor orchardists and probably not very good dairy men. They were in these two lines of production because some of their neighbors had been successful and not because they made a careful study of orchard trees and dairy cows. LIGHTS AND POULTRY PROFITS Another illustration of how practices do not bring anticipated results may be taken from a poultry study in California. Electric lights when properly used by poultrymen may increase the profit of the fiS ™-T S&lt; - fc BUt deCtriC " ghtS im PK&gt;Perlrused may be unpro - fitable Thirty-eight commercial flocks were listed in 4 groups. Group 1 used no lights, g roup 2 had lights turned on between 5 and 6, group 3 between 4:30 and 4:45, and group 4 between 4 and 4:20. The feat? me increased from 15 per cenfc fc first group to t I f J annUal f6ed consum P tio n decreased from 75 pounds per bird to 71% pounds; farm income per hen decreased from ?1.80 to ? .97; per hen and the percentage of eggs weighing 22 ox. per dozen ranged from 79 to 71.7 per^ cent. This makes a bad case for the .use of electee, lights and yet it! is probable that the trouble was not with the use of electric lights but with the manager of the poultry larm. He was probably trying to overcome some of his mismanage - ment by using electric lights butiinstead of helping him out, the lights only magnified his errors. The jthing that this group of poultrymen needed to know was that good ; breeding and flock management are more important than electric lights. And they further need to know that if a flock is not in good condition and vigorous, turning on electric lights early in the morning will ncrt only not fill the egg basket but will cause a heavy death loss in the flock.

            <seg id="p134">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE ROARD OF AGRICULTURE income from dairy products per farm of $710. Their incomes from all other sources averaged only $970 per farm. Among these 50 farmers were 21 owner operators, 16 owners additional and 13 tenants. The tenants' capital averaged $3,159, and their farm income $1,032. This gave them a good return for labor and management, $897 besides a house and farm products for family use. If an allowance of $800 per tenant had been allowed for labor wage the interest rate on their capital would have been a trifle over 7 per cent. The owners ad - ditional had an average capital of $18,255. Their farm income amounted to $1,099 and labor income $420. Now if this group had been allowed $800 for a labor wage the interest rate on their capital would have been slightly less than 1.5 per cent. Contrasted with these two groups is the owner group w'th a capital of $24,100 and a farm income of $941 — only about $150 less than the others — yet they have a labor income of only $96. If they were allowed $800 for wage their capital would receive only 7-12 of 1 per cent as interest earnings. This brief study is given to show how farmers have managed under adverse circumstances to get a little profit out of farm business. Thera was no tenant operator who did not make all expenses, earn interest on his capital and have something left over for his wage and manage - ment. One had only $121 and another $263. Five of the 13 tenants received over $1000 labor income and 3 more received over $900. Among the 16 owner additional farmers 3 failed to receive anything for wage. Three received over $1000 and 6 received about $45.00 per months or less than $500 per year. Twelve of the owners received no pay for labor and 7 received over $1000 for labor and management. </seg>

A brief study of the contrast of 15 best and 15 poorest farms out of a group of 77 farms which kept accounts for the crop year of 1926 as given in table VII will emphasize these factors. In the efficiency of labor the poorest group seem to rank first with 125 acres of crop per man. This is of f set, however, by the better group taking care of 3.5 animal units more per man. This may mean about 4 cows or 18 hogs more per farm and may partially overcome the value of 19 acres of crops. The horses on the better organized farms tend only one acre more per horse, but that extra acre means 32 bushels of corn or 24 bushels of oats or 20 bushels • of wheat — this is almost half enough grain to feed the horse for a year. After looking at the efficiency in acres we must next examine the efficiency in bushels of grain per farm. The 15 good farms grow 87 acres of corn making 32 bushels per acre, a total of 2,784 bushels. s This would take 138 acres of the poorest farmer's acres of 20 bushel j corn yet he produced only 76 acres. In wheat the good farms average ■ 700 bushels but the poor group only 338. It would require 54 acres of 13 bushel wheat but the group grew only 26 acres. If chinch bugs or \ hail storms or difference of soils caused these spreads we cannot blame the poor farmers. But if lack of legumes in the cropping system, poor seed bed preparation, lack of seed selection or the attempt to grow more acres than can be handled at the proper time — if any of these or other factors within the control of the farmer is the cause of his failure, then the fault must be placed at his door. A second factor in the growing of crops in favor of the better group is the fact that- they used approximately &gt;fc of their crop land for the cash crop — wheat — while the poorer group used only v e of their crop land for wheat. Another item of contrast between these two groups is the return from livestock. The good group not only had 14 more productive animal units per farm, but they received larger returns per animal unit. For each animal unit in swine the better group received $225 as against $156 received by the poorer group. For every dollar's worth : of feed given to livestock they received $2.09 while the other group received only $1.10. The net gain was $1.09 in the first instance but only 10 cents in the latter. This dollar gain on every dollar in feed used would add materially to the profit of the better farmers. Here I again we make allowance for disease or other uncontrollable factors. The size of the farms in these two groups compare favorably in value, $44,630 and $55,734; in acres, 240 and 218; and in acres of crops, 183 and 165. The profits obtained, however, are strikingly dif - ferent. The best group had a farm income of $3,341 as compared with j </seg>

In the tests at the Nebraska Experiment Station to be reported in this discussion, the spread in yields due to' the treatment given during this 10 week period, was from 14.3 bushels to 28.9 bushels as an average for five years. Just as the wheat crop requires water and. fertility, so also weeds use these substances in their growth. If weeds are permitted to grow during this 10 week period prior to sowing the wheat, they sap the soil of its water and tie up in their tissues, so far as the cur - rent crop is concerned, considerable fertility which would otherwise be available to the wheat. When the soil is in a cultivated, weed-free, and moist condition, maximum bacterial activity takes place in the soil, converting insoluble nitrogen into the nitrate form which is readily available for absorption by plants. The plants cannot utilize the soil nitrogen in any other form. Swat the weeds in their early stages of growth and thereby save soil moisture, convert and conserve a rela - tively generous supply of soil nitrates and establish a mellow moist seed bed in which the seed wheat may readily germinate, stool, and produce a strong root system.

            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ■'■•;; • -.. ■ The important seed bed preparation factors which are under the farmers control are time, manner, and depth of the tillage. Although plowing is commonly the basic) treatment, such supplementary tillage as disking, rolling, and harrowing may have much to do with the ulti - mate effectiveness of the seed bed produced. Listing or disking or some combination of these are substituted to some extent for the plowing. Although the exact results from various seed bed practices may be expected to vary somewhat in different localities, seasons, or conditions, I tiie results secured on the Experiment Station farm at Lincoln from 20 different methods of preparation during the 5 year period 1922 1926, should serve to point out emphatically that these problems should he given very serious thought. All of these determinations were made on comparative test plats in an apparently uniform field during the same years and according to customary experimental methods, and are regarded as fairly accurate. Pig. 8 — Wheat on early plowing In a co-operative test in Thayer County </seg>
            <seg id="p140">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It may be pointed out that for the sake of brevity of statement all plowed and listed plats were harrowed immediately after plowing 1 and Were uniformly disked just prior to sowing in addition to the dif - ferentiating treatments indicated for the various plats. The average results are all presented graphically in Chart 1. Combined Early Plowing and Timely Disking The effect of the time of plowing was determined in connection with two kinds of preparation, — plowing alone in July, August, and September to a depth of 7 inches, and similar plowing supplemented with timely disking to destroy weeds and volunteer grain. In the absence of supplementary tillage except harrowing im - mediately after plowing and double disking just prior to sowing late in September as given to all of the comparative plowed plats, in these tests, the yields of grain from plowing in various months were as fol - lows: September 15, 14.3 bushels; August 15, 25.5 bushels; and July 15, 22.4 bushels per acre. The wheat on the latest plowing showed .1 materially lower moisture content and available nitrates than in the case of plowing in the two earlier months. The seed bed condition was definitely inferior, being both ;nore cloddy and drier. Plowing August 15 proved 3 bushels superior to that done a month earlier, which at j first thought is contrary to the accepted principle favoring early pre - paration. However, without additional tillage to destroy -weeds, the land that was plowed July 15 had far greater opportunity to grow a thrifty crop of weeds and volunteer oats before planting than did the land plowed August 15. The latter plowing took place before the weeds in the stubble had made much growth and too little time remained thereafter before the final disking late in September, for very exten - sive weed development. Thus it may be concluded that in the absence of suitable supplementary tillage, mid-season plowing is somewhat more effective than extremely early plowing and far more so than late season plowing.

            <seg id="p142">KF.roUT or XEHKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The results were somewhat modified when the plowing at these same 3 dates was either preceded or followed by timely disking to control the weeds and thereby conserve more effectively the mois - ture and nitrates of the soil for the ensuing crop. September 15 plowing which had been double disked on July 15 and August 15, yielded 20.1 bushels per acre or 5.8 bushels increase due to the disking. August 15 plowing which had been double disked July 15 yielded 28.9 bushels which is an increase of 8.7 bushels over the September plowing. The latter had actually received more tillage to the extent of an additional double disking. In the case of this August plowing the double disking applied a month earlier re - turned 3.4 bushels more wheat per acre. Plowing on July 15 fol - lowed by double disking on August 15 yielded 28.4 bushels per acre, which is within half a bushel of the yield from August plowing which hail been disked in July. In the case of this July plowing 1 the doubled disking in August added 6.0 bushels per acre. From these experiments it may be concluded that where the main seed bed preparation for winter wheat consists of plowing, it should by all means be completed by the middle of August, and according to the time of plowing it should be either preceded or followed by double disking for the purpose of weed control as we'll as any beneficial physicial effects it may have. It is considered that these results are very fortunate in indicating a fairly long period, up to August 15, as suitable for getting the plow - ing completed. Because of other farm duties such as stacking the grain, threshing, or harvesting alfalfa, it is often not practical to complete the plowing in July. Barring unusual circumstances, the farm work can ordinarily be so managed as to enable completion of the plowing by about August 15, or 6 weeks after maturity of the crop. During 11 years, 1912-1922, as reported by the North Platte, Ne - braska, Experimental Substation, early plowing (August 15) yielded 16.2 bushels per acre compared with 13.7 for late plowing (Septem - ber \h.) Medium Depth Plowing Best For normal soil conditions such as represented in these experi - ments, plowing at a depth of 5 U 2 to 7 inches is most profitable. The matter of depth is a far less important factor in wheat yields than is the time at which the work is done. In a 5 year test of plowing depths during July and August in which suitable supplementary disking was practiced, the. average yields were as follows: 4 inches, 24.4 bushels; 5'^ inches, 26.2 bushels; T inches, 27.0 bushels, and 10 inches 27.3 bushels per acre. </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA. CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The "Law of Diminishing Returns" is fairly well illustrated by these tests. One can afford to increase the depth from 4 inches to 7 inches in order to secure the 2.6 bushels greater yield, but an added 0.3 bushel yield would not compensate for the added power required to plow to a depth of 10 inches. Land that was not plowed but double disked instead, in July, August, and September, yielded a bushel and a half more than Septem - ber plowing, which had been preceded by disking in both July and August, but it yielded approximately 7 bushels less than the best July and August plowing. Mere "stubbling in" of wheat as has been practiced to some extent in the west, is losing in favor because of un - satisfactory yields. : i At the North Platte Substation, plowing 3, 7, 10 and 14 inches deep yielded respectively 13.2, 15.2, 15.3, and. 14.5 bushels per acre compared with 12 bushels for mere disking as an 8-year average, 1912-1919. . . Wheat Responds to a Good Mechanical Condition of the Seed Bed As had been mentioned before the yield of winter wheat is deci-. " dedly influenced by the start it gets in the fall. This fall start is often closely. related to the mechanical condition of the seed bed at the time of sowing the seed. Cloddy, dry, loose soil is unfavorable for wheat development. Although , such a condition is sometimes entirely unavoidable it is more often due to poor seed bed management Such shortcomings may result from late preparation, or failure to work down the ground- with suitable, tillage implements. Ordinarily it is desirable to harrow the land almost immediately after the plow, before the soil has had time to dry out. The drying out of the soil by weed growth either before or after plowing, should be prevented by a timely disking or other effective tillage. A compact seed bed is generally known to result in far less winter . killing of plants in a very severe winter 'than takes place when the soil i is loose. In the Experiment Station tests which have been here reported, double disking at some time after plowing, together with the natural settling of the soil which usually occurs, appears to be quite effective from this standpoint. At least additional rolling with a cor - rugated land roller just before sowing results in no further increase in ■ yield. The effect of an unfavorable seed bed condition upon the stand and plant development may. be illustrated by the September plowing in these tests compared with that done in July or August The late plowing resulted in a reduction of 10 per cent in field stand, which to - gether with decidedly less stooling produced only two thirds as many heads on a given area of land as did the July plowing, </seg>
            <seg id="p144">KKI'UKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is reported by the North Platte, Nebraska, Substation that during 8 years, 1912-1919, the yield of wheat secured from packed soil was 15.4 bushels and from unpacked soil 13.6 bushels per acre. Listing vs Plowing for Wheat. The rapidity with which listing may be done and the satisfactory wheat yields resulting where this is used in substitution for plowing, make this a rather attractive basic method of preparing the wheat seed bed. Although not yet very extensively used, it is a method of continually increasing interest, and deserving of further investigation and trial in farm use. The most common procedure on farms where listing for wheat is in use, is to single list early after harvest, and level with a cultivator some time later, when conditions are favorable, and after volunteer grain and weeds have made a start. By harrowing ahead of seeding a fairly good seed bed may be expected. The method used in these tests at the Experiment Station was somewhat different from that described above and just what the dif - ference in results would be is not known. The land was single listed July 15, and the ridges were split with a lister on August 15. The ground was leveled by double disking and harrowing in September. The ground prepared by listing in this manner yielded at the rate of 27.8 bushels per acre compared with 28.4 bushels for land plowed 7 inches deep July 15 and disked August 15. Wheat Following Corn. Results from wheat drilled between the standing stalks of corn have proved this to be a very satisfactory manner of growing this crop in central Nebraska. In fact at the North Platte, Nebraska, Sub - station, higher winter wheat yields were secured following corn than after any other crop. An eleven year, 1912-1922, average is reported by that Station which shows the yield for wheat following small grain to be 15.2 bushels; following corn, 18.9 bushels; and 22.6 bushels after summer fallow. In the case of the summer fallow it takes 2 years to produce the one crop. Nevertheless it is a very successful method on extensive wheat farms in western Nebraska. At Lincoln wheat sown into standing stalks yielded 17.1 bushels compared with 28 4 bushels for 7 inch July plowing which was disked in August. Drilling into the corn field has not become common in eastern Nebraska and evidently it should not replace present methods. However, wheat may often be grown profitably in this way as a substitution for part of the oats acreage. Relation of Seed Bed to Grain Quality. Piybably as a result of the increased amount of available nitrates found in the soil in connection with early and thoroughly prepared seed </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NKBRASKA CHOI' GROWERS' ASSOCIATION beds, the protein content of the wheat is somewhat increased. A premium is often paid on the market for high protein wheat because of usual superior baking qualities. From these tests it would appear that the best preparation from the standpoint of yield is satisfactory from the standpoint of quality. A spread of 14.6 bushels in yield per acre, during the 5 year period 1922-J1926, was accompanied by a difference of nearly 1 per cent protein content of the grain in favor of the higher yield. The wheat grown on plats plowed July 15, August 15, and September 15, without additional supplementary disking, except just -.before sowing, had respective loaf volumes of 2010, 2014, and 1916 cubic inches. In. closing, it may not be out of place to state that in the matter of seed bed preparation for vJiriter wheat, the old addage applies: "It is the early bird that catches the worm."' PRESIDENT. MAGEE: We have recently heard a great deal about the use of combines in Nebraska. We are first going to hear from Senator Charles Warner of Waverly, who used a combine last year on his farm. We will then hear from 0. E. Linton of Dalton, Nebraska, who will discuss them from the Western Nebraska standpoint. WHAT ABOUT COMBINES IN MY PART OF NEBRASKA CHARLES WARNER, of Waverly ■ * i ■ . • MR. CHAIRMAN, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have only had one year's experience and probably can not give as much information as I would, like to. It might not be out of place to give you the reason why I had to buy a combine this year. I bought a new separator fifteen years ago and shortly after I bUght a gas tractor to pull it. These two machines are now almost worn out, and I didn't dare go into the harvest last summer with those two old machines. My winter wheat was heavy and. required good machinery so I had to do something. I began to look around for information and stopped in at the Agri - cultural' Engineering Department at the University to find out what information they had on the combine proposition. At first I was op - posed to the combine; I thought it was not a practical machine to use . in Lancaster County. But they gave me some reports so that I might see what they had done in other parts of the country. They said "Warner, you will eventually have a combine," and then they gave me that good old advice, "If eventually, why not now?" And I thought if I was gcing to get a combine I might as well get it soon. They gave me reports of April 1927 from the United States De - partment of Agriculture, which I read carefully. My attention was called to the fact that they had sent men into Texas, Oklahoma, Kan - sas, Nebraska and Montana to study the combines. Here are some of </seg>
            <seg id="p146">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE the most important figures that they reported in summarizing this study: &gt; Conclusions of U. S. D. A. on Combines "The combine harvester-thresher has given general satisfaction in harvesting wheat in the Great Plains region. Advantages of the combine are that it lowers the cost of harvesting and threshing, reduces the amount of labor required, and shortens the harvest and threshing period. Grain cut annually by combines of all types and sizes averaged 553 acres per machine. The capacity of the machine is primarily de - pendent on the width of cut and the length of the harvest season. The average for different types of machines ranged from 275 acres for the 8-foot machines, to 1,077 acres for the 20-foot machines. The average cut by 16-foot machines is 682 acres. In general, wheat was the only crop harvested. The acreage of other crops was small, and the time of ripening so nearly the same as that for wheat, that the use of the combine on other crops did not materially increase the capacity of the machines. The average rate of travel is 2.75 miles per hour, and for most machines varies between 2.5 and 3 miles per hour. The size of machine has no apparent effec*" on the rate of travel. The average length of the working day was 10.4 hours. Acres cut per hour ranged from 1.6 for the 8-foot to 4.5 for the 20-foot machines. The 16-foot combines averaged 3.8 acres per hour. The cut per hour for each foot of width is approximately 0.22 acres for most machines. The rate of cutting depends on the rate of travel and the size of the machine. For yields ordinarily reported in the Great Plains region, the rate of cutting is only slightly affected by the yield per acre. I ' . ' ' ■ Fig. 9 — Will the combine replace the binder on eastern Nebraska farms7 (Photo by Conservation and Survey DW. U. ol N.) </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA CROP GUOWEUS" ASSOCIATION ..j On the average, 0.6 of a gallon of gasoline per acre was used in the auxiliary engine. Fuel consumption per acre in the auxiliary engine is affected somewhat by the size of machine, rate of travel, and the yield of grain. ! A tractor with a drawbar rating of 15-hv»rsepower was used on most of the combines, although one-third of the 12-foot machines were drawn by smaller tractors. Fuel used in the' tractors on combines equipped with auxiliary engines averaged 0.8 gallons per acre The larger combines were slightly more economical than the small, machines in the use of fuel per acre. Fuel used in both auxiliary engine and tractor averaged 1.4 gallons per acre. The total fuel used per acre. in machines with power-drive was only slightly less. | Less than one-half of the labor used on combines was hired labor The . average amount of man labor furnished by the farmer for har - vesting with a combine is 0.75 man-hours per acre, as compared with d.6 man-hours usually furnished by the farmer for harvest and thresh - ing where grain is cut with a binder and 2.8 man-hours where the cutting is done with a header. The crew used for heading or for bind - ing if more than one binder is used. Repairs are estimated from available data at 10 cents per acre. For all combines, depreciation averaged 44 cents per acre. There is no apparent. relation between the acres cut annually and the esti - mated life of the machine. The per-acre depreciation charge is less for large than for small acreages cut by the same size of machine. For small acreages the expense of harvesting with a combine is greater than for either a binder or header. Where 75 or more acres are to be harvested the small combine may prove more economical than other machines. The large combine may be more economical than a binder or header if more than 100 acres are to be cut The choice between a large or small combine should be made on the basis of the capacity of the machine and the acreage to be cut. Where 300 or more acres are to be cut, the fixed charges of the combine are reduced to a low figure and the combine reaches its highest efficiency, i Where only the usual direct costs are considered, 100 acres could be harvested as cheaply with a binder or header as with a small combine. The average harvesting loss with combines is 2.6 per cent of the total yield as compared with 3.3 per cent for a header and 6.1 per cent for a binder. The actual loss for grain cut with the combine averaged 32 pounds per acre as compared to 40 pounds for the header and 74 pounds for the binder. </seg>
            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The average threshing loss with combines was 1.9 per cent of the grain threshed as compared to 1.1 per cent for the stationary tractor. Factors other than harvest costs which should be included in the consideration of the use of the combine are: Possibility of loss of grain from weather or from shattering, disposal of straw, quality of grain and moisture content of the grain as it is threshed. A 10-foot combine should harvest 375 acres in a 15-day harvest season. The minimum profitable acreage in the Great Plains where combines for custom cutting are available would be about 160 acres, while the maximum would be about 640 acre. A 15-foot combine " should harvest about 500 acres in 15 days, with a minimum of 200 and a maximum of 800 acre." Spread of Combines "The Agricultural Engineering Department also cited me to some reports by J. P. Blauser, Professor Agricultural Engineering, of the University of Illinois, Mr. Blauser made the statement that in 1924 there was one combine in Illinois, in 1025 there were 12 combines and in 1926 there were 64 combines. I do not have the report for 1927. In this article he maile the statement that he found that the greatest ob - jection to Vne combine came from people who had had no experience with them; that the people who had had experience had not complained. My attention was also called to Kansas, where in 1926 thirty per cent of the wheat was harvested by combines and 1927 forty-eight per cent was thus harvested. Nine years ago there were no combines in use. My attention was also called to the labor question in Kansas where as a rule ', there was a great shortage of labor. In 1927 there appeared in the Lincoln papers an editorial stating that the demand for farm hands in Kansas had dropped over fifty per cent, due to the combine. And after gathering all of that information I could not do anything else but buy a combine. My Combine Experience I bought one, and started to cut the best wheat I had on the place, which made 37 bushels to the acre. The price of wheat was $1.27!£ cents a bushel and I sold it at that, which was top price in Lancaster County last season. The wheat at the elevator tested 62 pounds to the bushel. And right here I might say that Mrs. Warner endorses the combine unqualifiedly. If any of you men have trouble with your better-half ■ because of harvest, I might suggest that this amounts to nothing when you have a combine. In Lancaster County with a combine you can thresh your wheat early, sell it early, and get the best price. </seg>

QUESTION— What acreage of wheat would you have to have in order to own a combine ? MR. WARNER— For a small combine you ought to have 75 or 80 acres. For a 16 foot combine 140 acres. WHAT ABOUT COMBINES IN MY PART OF NEBRASKA A. E. LINTON, Dalton, Nebraska 1 live in Cheyenne county, which r supposed to be the largest wheat producing county in the state. Mr. Warner just told us some - thing about the number of combines sold in Illinois. As near as I can rind out we have in Cheyenne County 400 combines, and at least three-quarters of the wheat crop was cut with combines this past year. The oat crop is largely cut with binders, although it can be cut, and some was cut this year with combines, and they do very good work. But there are two sides to the question of the combine; there are some draw backs of using the combine. Mr. Warner spoke of hail, Hail is a very serious objection and this year by letting the wheat stand the extra ten days that is really required to make it ripe enough to use the combine, we had some very heavy losses by hail. Then there is another loss in that part of the state, which is the shattering of the wheat by winds. This year we had some very heavy winds that caused some loss by shattering. But even taking those disadvantages into consideration since wheat is our main crop, the land lays level and is in big fields, the use of the combine is practical, and it makes it much easier to harvest that way. Someone asked how little an acreage the combine would be practical on. I think Mr. Warner was about right, a nine or ten foot machine would take 75 or 100 acres, and the larger farmers have 15 or 16 foot cuts. You can harvest with a 16 foot machine all the way up to 300 or 400 or even 500 acres. I have a 16 foot machine which I use on 300 acres. One advantage of the use of the combine with us is in getting the wheat off earlier so we can get the seedbed ready, which is very important in that section of the state, due to the necessity of conserving the moisture. Tha; mates a great difference in our yield of wheat. </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Fig. 10 — The combine has proved its value under Western Nebraska con - ditions. (Photo by Conservation and Survey Div. TJ. of N.) One question conies up in our section, in the heavy wheat, and that is the straw proposition. Mr. Warner spoke about plowing the straw - in. One disadvantage we find is not having the moisture that you have in this section of the state to rot the straw. Most people find it the best practice to burn the stubble off, but that brings up the question • of what such a practice will eventually do to the soil. In a fourteen year test at the Scottsbluff Station I understand that plats from which the straw is annually burned has outyielded one where it is left in the land. • A person must use judgment in starting to. use the combine or he will have more or less trouble in the wheat heating, but where it is reasonably ripe you will have very little trouble with that. Mr. Warner said we get less for our wheat in western Nebraska. This last year $1.09 was our top price; and where your wheat gets dry you may expect to get the top price. Some claim that by binding the wheat they get a better price, but when they started to haul from threshers they got only $1.12, or three cents more than we were getting for the combined wheat. When you count the difference in expense I hardly think you are making anything, because it costs so much more to cut the grain and harvest it that way. Then there is the help proposition, and the difference in work for the women folks. There is . certainly a great difference there. This last year during wheat har - vest it was wet and damp weather and we didn't get started until 8:30 or 9 o'clock, but we usually combined until about 8 o'clock at night. After that the dew rises and one can't do good work. More of these combines are coming into use all the time in that section of the state.

There is pretty good money in the custom work; it runs from $2 to $3 up to the thirteen bushel to the acre, and above that five cents a bushel. MR. KE1M — In this day of diversified farming it seems strange to me that we should begin to talk about combining oats. My father would not think (if throwing his oat straw out on the ground, and 1 am wondering how many farmers from eastern Nebraska have 75 acres of wheat and how many farmers this discussion is really in line with. I am inclined to think that very few men in this room from eastern Nebraska have 75 acres of wheat. If they have that much wheat they should also have quite a large bunch of livestock. Where they I hnve livestock they certainly don't want to throw the straw out on the ground. I heard a lot of farmers out in Cheyenne and Kimball counties last year say "Hang this combine business; if I had started at the right time with binders I would have had this wheat harvested in good shape." I heard a lot of elevator men say worse things. I am quite fairly sold on the combine under certain conditions, but Senator Warner painted such a rosy picture for eastern Nebraska that I could not help saying something in regard to it. QUESTION — Do you consider the straw of any value to you in Cheyenne County? MR. LINTON — Not very much except for taking care of what stock we have, and that is not much. There are thousands of tons of straw burned in the stack. QUESTION— Are they saving any more of it as the years go by? MR. LINTON — Not very much. Now they have straw spreaders on most of the combines that spread the straw four or five feet behind the machine. MR. GRAFF — I take it you are not a farmer by proxy, are you? MR. LINTON— No. MR. GRAFF — You understand your business out where you live, and you are a farmer yourself. MR. LINTON— I have 720 acres.- MR. GRAFF— Did you ever live in eastern Nebraska? MR. LINTON— Yes. MR. GRAFF— Would you recommend to every farmer in eastern Nebraska with 120 or 160 acres, and raising livestock and in diversified farming to use a combine? MR. LINTON— No. </seg>

The combine will handle grain under very unfavorable conditions. There are problems connected with the use of the combine which we must not lose sight of. The biggest problem in Virginia was not cutting the gram, but taking care of it after it was cut and threshed because of the moisture content. This is one of the biggest problems our eastern country has to solve. "'Beesi proDiems * ■ I ■ ■' Combines in Eastern States. Quite, a number of combines are operating in Pennsylvania. Last year they had five and this year thirty under observation. In New York state there are quite a number. They have tried it out on different grains and found that it worked very well with wheat rye, oats, timothy, clover and soy beans. Buckwheat ripens very un - evenly and was not harvested very satisfactorily. ' Indiana reported quite a large number of combines as did also Minnesota and the Dakotas. : For the eastern states it is necessary that the separating, capacity </seg>
            <seg id="p154">KKPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE should be increased; that is, the separator mechanism should be made wider in proportion to the cut than is used for our western Nebraska conditions. A man from Wisconsin was the only one who gave an adverse re - port Of three combines purchased only one was kept. When asked why this adverse report he said that in one case the combine was used on a farm that was rather hilly, and that it was almost impossible for a tractor to pull the combine. The man figured he would be better off without the combine. I want to discuss for a minute a swathing or windrowing attach - ment. This was first used, so far as I know, by Thomas Campbell of Montana. He took the binding attachment off of the binders and made them so he could place a 30 foot swath in one windrow. After the grain had been in the windrow a few days for drying he would go down the line with a hay-loader arranged in connection with the combine so as to throw the grain into the combine. This year at least one manufacturer has brought out an attachment which scoops the windrow up onto the combine platform. Men who reported on the swather method at this meeting were very much in favor of it for the eastern part of this state and in other states where there is a heavy rainfall in the threshing season. The cost of harvesting will, of course, be added to somewhat. One man was asked what happens in case of a severe windstorm. He replied that if the wind blows very hard it scatters the grain somewhat. To overcome this he has devised a scheme to stake the windrow down so as to take care of almost any situation that arises. Advantages and Disadvantages of Combines. Some of the advantages of the combine are: early plowing tending to conserve moisture and permitting the nitrogen to accumulate; imr mediate marketing of the grain hence no storage cost; and as Mr. Warner mentioned, it relieves the women of the drudgery of cooking for a larpe harvest crew. There are some disadvantages in the use of the combine; one of these is that it practically makes necessary the market - ing of the grain within a short time which is liable to lead to congest - ing of the market facilities. Damp grain must be especially cared for and that we must consider as a definite problem in the corn-belt states Some of us may not look upon the combine as a practical thing, yet we must look the facts squarely in the face and note that this new method of harvesting is coming very fast. The manufacturers have wanted to retard it as they were not ready in their development of this machine for the tremendous demand that has come for it. One manufacturer has made the statement several times that in ten years the binder business would be where the wagon business is today. One </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATIO.V man has said that the first year the combine owner should go on a fishing trip when the grain is beginning to ripen so that he will not get into the field and out before it is ready. It should be left about ten days longer in the field to become thoroughly ripe when the com - bme is used. If the grain is Weedy the combine will scatter weed seeds over the ground unless use is made of an attachment that collects the weed seeds. .-.-•. Hail is a hazard that must be considered as being liable to come along- and ruin the crop. The swathing attachment reduces this hazard somewhat for if hail does come it may pound the grain out of the heads, it lays there in the straw and much of it is picked up with the " pick-up attachment. There are two or three things that should be kept in mind with reference to the time of cutting. Namely, the degree of ripeness of the gram, the time of day to begin to cut and how soon one should ' resume work after a rain. Last year the United States Department of Agriculture set up a laboratory in North Dakota right in the heart of the wheat belt and made a study of these various factors. In this study it was found green weed seeds in wheat, which is sufficiently dry for proper storage, will materially lower the test weight and grade of the grain as well as cause heating in storage. Some method of re - moving the green material immediately is necessary. The moisture content of the grain is quite high in the morning and ' cutting should .be delayed in the day until it has dried out considerably. One should not get into a hurry to resume cutting after a rain as the moisture content will remain quite high for some time after the rain has ceased to fall. No definite rule can be laid down as to the length of time to wait as this will depend upon wind movement, tem - perature and humidity of the atmosphere. THE PRESIDENT— Perhaps we have a few minutes which may be ' used for discussion, if you have any questions you would like to ask Mr. Sjogren. QUESTION— I wonder about that picking up attachment after the gram is in the swath; in the long stubble that we have in Nebraska how is any hay-loader or attachment to get the grain out of the lone stubble? ; MR. SJOGREN— As I understand it the swath is not heavy enough to bear the stubble down, and furthermore the pick-up goes clear down and gets it all. The hay-loader was only a makeshift. QUESTION— How much straw do they cut where they use the binders in swathing? </seg>
            <seg id="p156">KPOHT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE MR. SJOGREN — Just enough to get all the heads. j MR. KEIM — How many farmers in the state can afford to feed baled straw? MR. SJOGREN — Of course that is a question to be considered! but if they use the combine and want to harvest the straw they will harvest it in the cheapest way. If a man can bale it stimultaneously it would seem to me to be cheaper than using a hay-loader. QUESTION — Do they use wire for binding on the baler? MR. SJOGREN— They have not perfected the binding part as that is what is holding them back. QUESTION — I read the other day a statement that they are now trying to use the combine on the grain sorghums, kaffir corn and so on just as they do on the small grain. That they were working out into the dryer countries where the corn grows short, and were even trying to work it on harvesting corn, but that at present the mechanism was a little light for that sort of work. There are changes being made in the mechanism and they expect to do these things. MR. SJOGREN— I might say on that that the harvesting of the grain sorghums by means of the combine has been going on for a number of years, and it has been determined that it is a very practical thing to do. One reason that the combine had had such a growth in Illinois is that it is very practical for harvesting soy beans. In har - vesting them by the old method they wasted from thirty to forty percent of the beans but by the combine this has cut to eight percent and less. THE PRESIDENT— Of course all wheat must eventually go to market, and they will give us what it is worth, but before they do that they get an expert to grade it. We are very fortunate this afternoon in having with us to discuss the subject of grading and inspection, the . | chief inspector of the Omaha Grain Exchange, Mr. Harry G. Clark. '. Mr. Clark is not unknown to us, because he has worked with us on our special trains as we went over the state, and I am sure we will be glad to hear what he has to give us at this time. </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMF ROVE NEBRASKA'S WHEAT CROP? HARRY G. CLARK, Chief Inspector, Omaha Grain Exchange I have been asked to tals on this subject from the terminal market viewpoint. We. in the 1 Omaha market, have in mind three things that can be done to improve Nebraska's wheat crop: The eli - mination of smut, rye mixture and mixed wheats. There are no good reasons why we shouldn't raise good milling wheat in Nebraska; everything is in our favor; excellent soil and climatic conditions being two of the most important factors. Now, why shouldn't we take advantage of these excellent conditions and pay a little more attention to the selection of our seed and the preparation of our soil. .Raise good milling wheat and the millers will make a beaten path to our doors. :| ■ ■ ■ • ' .-' - ■ ■ .! Fig. n— There. is too much rye in Nebraska wheat. Normally the price per biiHhel of whrat Is reduced one cent for every percent of rye that it contains up to ten vercont. above which the cut In price Increases rapidly. ■ , .j Smut- should be eliminated by all means. Do you realize that smut has cost the farmers of Nebraska millions of dollars? On the wheat marketed through Omaha in 1927, I am safe in saying that half a million dollars have been lost in smut discount alone, and when you take into consideration the loss in yield, the total loss will greatly exceed a million, dollars. Millers fight shy of smutty wheat so terminal elevators must buy it. They, in turn, must remove the smut by washing, liming or scour - ing, and that is the reason for smut discounts. The average discount </seg>
            <seg id="p158">kKI'OKT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE on smutty wheat ranges from two to fifteen cents a bushel. light smut normally discounts from two to four cents a bushel, medium smut four to seven cents a bushel and heavy smut eight' to fifteen cents a bushel. I might Rive you an idea of the percentage of smutty wheat ar - riving- at the Omaha market. In 1923—15.3^ of the receipts were smutty, 1924—22.9% " " 1925—32.4% " " 1926— 38.4 % " " 1927— 26.97 C " " The crop for 1927 shows a decided improvement over the 1926 crop as the 1927 crop was probably three times as large as the 1926 crop. This improvement has come about largely through the treatment of seed wheat for smut. Some very excellent work has been done by- the Nebraska College of Agriculture, Union Pacific Railroad, Burlington Railroad and the Omaha Grain Exchange on the treating of seed wheat for smut. In 1926 a wheat train was run over lines of 'the Union Pacific in Nebraska and in 1927 a similar train was run over lines of the Burlington in Nebraska. These trains accomplished a great deal ■ of good and it is felt that a very good percentage of the seed wheat planted this fall was treated for smut. What we are striving for, however, is that the seed wheat planted be treated 100%. If you are interested in the treatment for smut, get in touch with your County Agent, Nebraska College of Agriculture, Union Pacific Railroad, Bur - lington Railroad, or Omaha Grain Exchange, and they will gladly supply you with the information. Rye Mixtures Rye mixtures are getting to be very prevalent in Nebraska, and this year we have noticed it particularly. The range is anywhere from l c / c to 30%. Discounts on rye mixtures range from two to forty cents a bushel. Normally, the discount is one cent for every one percent of rye until a ten percent mixture is reached, then the discount widens out very sharply. It can be seen from these discpunts that it is not profitable to raise rye mixed wheat, and the boys at the Nebraska College of Agriculture tell me there is no good reason for having rye mixed wheat. Also, millers are not interested in rye mixed wheat as the rye darkens his flour. </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION Wheat Mixtures Mixed wheat along with other varieties of wheat which have no particular milling value should be eliminated. A mixture of Red Durum and Hard Red Winter or Red Durum and Hard Red Spring have no milling value whatsoever and, naturally, they are subject to large discounts. It is just as easy to plant a pure type of Hard Red Winter or Hard Red Spring as a mixture, and when you sow a pure type of Hard Red Winter or Hard Red Spring, you knew that you are planting the best milling variety and one which will bring you the highest price when you ship it to market. Other varieties that have no particular milling value are mostly of the spring varieties, such as Red Durum, Humpback, Ghirka and other scrub varieties. These varieties are easily recognized and suffer a very stiff discount. I have seen some of these scrub varieties dis - counted forty cents a bushel under a good Hard Red Winter or Hard Red Spring Wheat. Even if some of these scrub wheats yield more than Hard Red Winter and Hard Red Spring, it does not pay to raise them as the discounts will more than- off set the increased yield. . • ■ / Protein In the last four or five years the leading grain markets have installed protein laboratories to take care of analyses of protein. In the Omaha market a protein analysis is run on practically every car of wheat received. Millers buy their supplies of wheat on the protein contents; therefore, the price is governed accordingly. Unless you have watcned the newspapers and noticed the prices paid for protein wheat, you will be surprised at the size of the premiums. For a while this winter, on wheat running 11% or better, each tenth of 1% of protein was worth one cent a bushel. This condition has been brought about due to a scarcity of high protein wheat. The average protein content of the 1926 crop was 12.26%, while the average for the 1927 crop was 11.12%.. In normal years the average premium for one percent of protein ranges from three to six cents a bushel. In conclusion I am going to ask you to improve Nebraska's wheat so that we will have the millers asking for our wheat. We can do it with a little work. -■'■ ; ■ • ' ••;••■■■(-'• </seg>
            <seg id="p160">{KI'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURK ■ WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE NEBRASKA WHEAT . CROP, FROM THE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE VIEWPOINT D. L. GROSS, Extension Agronomist I have only a few words to say. Mr. Clark I think, touched on the very points I had planned on speaking about. One word on the smut proposition. We find the smut is coming east prptty fast and the wheat growers in eastern Nebraska will have ti&gt; pay more attention to their seed wheat in the future than they have in the past. Each year more smutty wheat is going onto the market from eastern Nebraska. We have been carrying on a campaign for the last two or three years to eliminate this loss from smut. We know that it can be eliminated by seed treatment. We find smut is not the same every year. Mr. Clark showed that in 1926, 38 per cent and in 1027, 27 per cent of the wheat reaching the Omaha market was smutty. I think a large part of that difference was due to the fact that we had favorable weather in the fall of 1926. The fall weather is an important factor in determining the amount of smut we will have the next year. Of course if clean seed is planted, no matter what Mnd of a fall we have there will be no smut; but with smutty seed sometimes we will have little and again if fall weather conditions are bad we may have a heavy loss. Wheat germinated very rapidly in the fall of 1926 anc oven where the seed was quite smutty it came through in very good . shape. Many times a farmer will treat his seed while his neighbor will - not. It may so happen that the one who did not treat his seed will have as little smut as the one who did treat. Those two farmers might get the idea that seed treatment didn't amount to much. They might not realize that the weather and soil conditions were the controlling factors. Seed treatment is the cheapest kind of insurance against smut. We may not have heavy losses every year even though we do not treat, but neither do we have a fire every year. Nevertheless we always keep up our insurance. We can't tell what kind of fall conditions j we will have when we sow our wheat, or how much smut there is likely to be. </seg>

Most of you are acquainted vrith the certified seed sold by members of this association. To those of you who are not familiar with that I will say that it is seed that conies from the college and goes to the differerent farmers, and is grown under certain rules and regulations. It is inspected in the field by some one from the college or from the Crop Growers Association, and if it passes the in - spection it is called certified seed. This is then sold to anyone who wants to buy it, for probably a little increase in price. This year for the first time a sales tax was charged. Each one who sells certified seed for planting is supposed to pay to the association 2 per cent of the sale price of the seed. This tax is used to advertise the seed and to help carry on the other work of the association. A quantity of pure Marquis spring wheat has been shipped into northwestern Nebraska. This is being certified at the present time and we hope that eventually most 'of the farmers of that section will be growing this one variety. If only one variety is grown in a neighbor - hood, a more uniform grade of wheat will go to market.

I don't know why that is unless it is be - cause of the big advertising campaign that Kansas started awhile back advertising- her wheat. This advertising is still going on. As a matter of fact we know that in Nebraska we have fewer varieties of wheat than they do in Kansas and consequently a more uniform quality. In Kansas they have a large number of different varieties and for that reason the quality of their wheat must not be as uniform as ours. We need to do a little advertising 1 ourselves. One of the main purposes of the Crop Growers Association at the present time is to get the fanners to growing one or two particular good varieties of wheat, or at least to eliminate some of the poorer varieties. Nebraska farmers are at the present time growing mostly Turkey Red, Kanred and Ne - braska No. 60. If we can concentrate on these varieties we can im - prove quality and uniformity of our wheat. QUESTION— Wouldn't smut on the ground, and volunteer wheat that wouldn't be treated, make a great difference in the amount of smut ? MR. GROSS — Volunteer wheat is very seldom smutty, because the smut spores get on the seed when it is threshed. QUESTION— What causes smut? MR. GROSS — It is a parasite that grows from a spore on the seed. This spore germinates when the seed does and infects the young - plant. The wheat right now is either infected or it is not infected, and it will remain that way because infection takes place at the time the seed germinates. Cool weather at seeding time is in favor of the smut. Warm weather and plenty of moisture, causes a rapid germination of the seed and is not favorable to smut infection. THE 1927 WHEAT YIELD CONTEST D. L. GROSS, Extension Agronomist The wheat yield contest conducted by the Agricultural College in 1927, was participated in by 21 wheat growers, 13 of whom were in eastern Nebraska and 8 from western Nebraska. For several reasons this contest did not work out so successfully as we had anticipated, and it is most likely that it will not be continued. First of all of course was the seeming lack of interest. Records on but twenty-one men do not give enough figures, from which one might draw reliable conclusions. In the second place, the yields and profits per acre can not be easily correlated with proven farm practices. The weather element in wheat production seems to over shadow other factors, to such an extent that recognized good practices are forced more or less </seg>

            <seg id="p164">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE nOARI. OK AGRICULTURE more economical machine for harvesting the crop than the binder and threshing machine. An average of twenty-six acres was entered by each man. Thresh - ing machine ov combine weights or measures, certified to by the con - testant and another disinterested party, were used in determining the yield. The measurements of the field were certified to in much the same manner. THE PRESIDENT— We will now hear a few words from the high man in the wheat yield contest, Mr. A. E. Ldnton, of Cheyenne County. MLR. LINTON — I was surprised to come out the way I did in the contest, because 1 thought I had a low yield compared with what I had had before. I had 37.2 bushels on my field entered in the con - test, and I thought I wouldn't have any show at all. It was possibly due to the way I handled my ground, the time I prepared' it and such things as that. In preparing this seed bed for summer fallow for wheat, after corn planting I gave the ground a good disking and har - rowing. I have found that in order to cut down the cost of labor on the ground it is well not to plow too early, because it requires a great deal more work than it does to disk and harrow it and let it lay, and then beginning about the middle of June to plow it. I began about the middle of June in this one field, and I plowed good and deep, and. then harrowed it; also I kept the weeds down. There are many dif - ferent ways of doing that; some do it with a harrow, others have a . knife arrangement which is coming into practical use out there; also a blade machine. There are so many different machines it is hard to say which is the best; but the main thing is to keep the weeds off in order to get the moisture, and when you sow your seed you may know it is going to germinate. I also practice treating wheat for smut. I have used the copper carbonate treatment for several years; it costs three to five cents an acre to treat the seed, and it is hard to tell how much you will gain by it, but it makes a tremendous difference. There is a large loss from smut every year, but in 1926 it seemed to he much larger than usual. I use one of the commercial treaters. This year I got one of those power mixers. We can get along with less seed out there in the west than you can in the eastern part of the state; this year I sowed 45 pounds of seed to the acre. Of course we use combines to cut down the expense on wheat, which this last year I pulled with horses. I haven't had a tractor so far and I don't know whether that would cut down the cost or not. In larger farming, horses would not be practical. THE PRESIDENT— Yesterday when we got to talking and got into a little discussion, Mr. Linton proved to be very well posted on his </seg>

' ■ J ".■...' - REPORT OF 1927 TEN ACRE CORN YIELD CONTEST By P. H. STEWART and D. L. GROSS The fourth annual Nebraska Corn Yield Contest was participated in by more corn growers than in any previous contest. One hundred seventeen completed in 1927, as compared to 68 in 1926, 87 in 1925 and 39 in 1924. The 1927 contest was fostered and supervised by the Departments of Agronomy and Rural Economics of the College of Agriculture. P. H. Stewart and D. L. Gross of the Agronomy department and Mason Yerkes and Arthur George of the Rural Economics department were active in conducting the contest. The latter department was interested from the stand point of figures on cost of production, while the Agronomy department sought to draw correlations between various agronomic practices with yield and profit per acre. The rules for the 1927 contest were much the same as in previous years. The state was divided into three regions, eastern, central and western Nebraska, those who irrigated their corn being placed in a class by themselves. . '• </seg>

The average yields of all the contestants in the various sections . •were as follows: Eastern region 68 bushels, central region 47.3 bushels, western region 40 bushels, and irrigated class 67.8 bushels. For the eastern section the 1927 contest demonstrated more than ever the importance of legumes in their effect on soil fertility, with the resulting higher yields and consequent increased profit per acre. In the central and western sections this correlation was not so ap - parent. In these sections, tillage practices used, are no doubt the dominating factors. Unquestionably, however, those practices which tend to maintain the organic matter content of the soil, whether in eastern or western Nebraska, will in the end result in maximum yields. A new feature of the contest this year was the securing of soil samples from fields entered in the contest in Cass and Douglas counties as well as from adjoining or nearby fields of the same soil type, but which were badly run down due to poor management. A comparison of the high ten fields in Cass and Douglas counties to five nearby poor fields, shows a yield of 81.2 bushel for the good fields and 20.0 bushels for the poor fields, (see diagram below). The organic matter content of the soil on the good fields averaged 4.15%, while that of the poor fields was 2.75%. In other words a 33y 0 reduction of ' the organic matter in the soil was associated with a 75% reduction in yield. No doubt all of this difference in yield was not due to the dif - ference in organic matter, but it would appear at least that this is the </seg>

These poor fields, originally, were as productive as the good fields, and even now have the same potential yielding possibilities'. They can be brought back to their original productivity by seeding them to legumes and by the applica - tion of. manure. They are as rich in mineral plant food elements as the good fields, but are lower in nitrogen and organic matter. Two years of sweet clover would work wonders with these fields.

The average yield on the nine upland fields was 85.1 bushels, while the six bottom land fields yielded 81.5 bushels. These fifteen fields averaged only a little over two years since they were seeded down to a legume, and yielded 83.fi bushels. The 72 con - testants who finished in the eastern region with an average yield of 66 bushels, grew their corn on land which on the average had been farmed for but three years since it was seeded to" a legume. ' </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The average yield for all farmers in eastern Nebraska was 38 bushels. Figuring that these men spent as much man and horse labor as the average man in the contest, their cost of growing and cribbing corn this year was about fifty cents per bushel, while those in the contest produced their corn for 37c per bushel. In central Nebraska the 19 contestants who finished had an average yield of 47.3 bushels per acre and produced their corn for 35c per bushel. The fields entered in the contest had been farmed on the average 16 years since they were seeded to a legume or were in sod. Only five of the nineteen fields were bottom, land. The average yield for all farmers in the central section was thirty bushels for 1927. Using the average cost figures for this section, the cost of growing and husking corn was in the neighborhood of forty-five cents per bushel-. In the western section eighteen men completed with an average yield of forty bushels and produced their corn for 35c per bushel. The six high fields in this section were on bottom land in Furnas county, and averaged 66.5 bushels. The other twelve fields with one exception were on upland in Cheyenne county and averaged about twenty-five bushels per acre. The average estimated yield for the whole western section in 1927 was twenty-two bushels per acre. On the average cost basis, it cost forty-five cents per bushel to produce corn in western Nebraska in 1927. In the irrigated class the average yield of the contestants was 68 bushels and their cost per bushel was 33% cents. No average yield for all irrigated land is obtainable, and accurate average cost figures cannot therefore be calculated. Estimating the average yield of corn under irrigation to be forty-five bushels, the average cost per bushel would be in the neighborhood of forty-two cents. Table VIII gives the estimated average yield, costs etc., for the various sections.

            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The importance of high yields in reducing the cost per bushel of growing corn is shown by the drawing below. The various items are calculated after rent has been deducted, and apply only to the re - maining corn. With corn yielding 38 bushels per acre and valued at 65 cents per bushel, 27 cents of the value of each bushel must go to the cost of man labor, 22 cents for horse and machinery cost and one cent for seed. This leaves fifteen cents as the profit, on each bushel. With a yield of eighty-six bushels which was the average of the ten high men in the eastern region, twenty-one cents of the value of each bushel goes for man labor, 9.6 cents for horse and machinery cost and .4 cents fpr seed, leaving 34 cents as the profit on each bushel. Placing this on the acre basis the following diagram shows that the profit per acre with a 38 bushel yield is $3.45, while with an 86 bushel yield the profit is $17.58. per acre. In other words one acre yielding 86 bushels is as profitable as five acres yielding 38 bushels. The man with 86 bushels yield could put half of his land in legumes and still make two and one-half times as much profit on his corn as the man with a 38 bushel yield, besides having the legumes for the pro - duction of livestock.

            <seg id="p172">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The profit per acre from the various yields is shown even more graphically in the drawings below. These show that for eastern Ne - braska a forty bushel yield is over two and one-half times as profitable as a thirty bushel yield, and an acre yielding fifty bushels is as prof - itable as four acres yielding thirty bushels. Likewise an acre yielding fifty-two bushels is as profitable as two acres yielding thirty-eight bushels. In central Nebraska one acre yielding forty bushels is equal in profits to two acres yielding thirty bushels. In western Nebraska an acre yielding thirty bushels is equal in profits to two and one-half acres yielding twenty bushels. Comparing the different sections we find that a thirty bushel yield in central Nebraska is twice as profitable as the same yield in eastern Nebraska. This is due to a difference in rents and to the amount of labor required to produce an acre of corn. For the same reason a twenty bushel yield in western Nebraska is more profitable than a thirty bushel yield in eastern Nebraska. A study of the labor records for producing corn reveals some interesting facts. In the table below it is seen that there is a general tendency to produce the corn with less and less man labor per acre. In 1924 it required about nine hours of man labor for each acre of corn in eastern Nebraska, while in 1927 only seven hours was ex - pended. Likewise in central and western Nebraska there seems to be a general reduction in the man labor requirement. Unquestionably this is being brought about largely by the more general use of larger machinery, particularly the two row cultivators, gang plows, and two row listers. This tendency will no doubt result in cheaper corn produc - tion provided the labor saved, can be employed usefully elsewhere. Unless this is done however, the added cost of larger machinery is not justified and would result in higher rather than lower costs. The tendency towards fewer farmers and larger farms in Nebraska, is an indication that the time farmers are saving by larger machinery, is being profitably employed.

Unusual conditions most probably contributed towards the attainment of this record. Under average conditions either more horse or man labor would have to be used in order to produce a good crop. Some interesting data was secured in the 1927 contest by making counts of the stand on a number of fields. It was found, for instance, ' that in thirty-three typical eastern Nebraska contest fields there was an average of sixty-five per cent of a stand on the basis of three stalks per hill and the rows three feet six inches apart. The highest yield, 92 bushels was produced on a field having 77 per cent of a stand while the lowest yield, 40 bushels, was grown on a field having a 44 per cent stand. The soil on this low yielding field was rich, it being the first crop following a legume but there was not stand enough to make a high yield. The eight fields having the highest yields averaged .84 bushels per acre and averaged 73 per cent of a perfect stand while the eight lowest yielding fields averaged 48 bushels with an average stand of 53 per cent perfect. All of these particular fields were in two adjoining counties with fairly uniform weather conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION fprfTf 8 * *?"* - StandS Wi " the best results will depend on soil fertility and moisture conditions. Only one field of the entire 72 in the 1927 contest -was -too thick. This field had a 102 per cent stand and showed considerable. damage byffiring. Had timely rains fallen this field would undoubtedly have made about 100 bushels per acre. Gerald Wiicox of McCook, Nebraska under irrigation, plants his com thick and in rows only 33 inches apart. His yield of 93.5 bushels this year and past yields ranged well over 100 bushels per acre shows that where moisture is not a factor thick planting pays. It is inter - esting in this respect to note that Ira Marshall of Dola, Ohio who holds the worlds records for the yield of corn on a 10 acre field plants very thick, averaging about 19,000 stalks per acre which would be 184 aLTiX? n °™ aI three * er m 8&lt; and. It must be remembered though that in addition to being located under very favorable climatic conditions he has an exteremely rich much sub-irrigated field such as few if anv other farmers have. A good stand considering local con - ditions must be had though to obtain a high yield. When we realize that, of the acre cost of growing a field of corn, the seed cost normally I amounts to but less than one per cent of the total cost-we begin to appreciate ithe fact that the cost of seed corn is a minor matter. It is nard to over, emphasize the importance of good seed of a well selected and adapted variety. Planting poor seed is an extremely poor way to start an economy drive in growing corn or any other crop for that matter. ■ • ■ - i TABLE XI-COMPARISON OF STAND, EAR SIZE AND YIELD OF CORN IN EASTERN, CENTRAL AND WESTERN NEBRASKA 1927 Corn Yield Contest I III % iiil jj il Western Nebraska":..

            <seg id="p176">RKPOriT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PRESIDENT MAGEE— I am a little at a loss as to how to in - troduce the next speaker, because he is much better known to this audience than I am. Perhaps if I would tell a little story about my own experience it would bring home to you the work of this family in Nebraska. I had the misfortune of being born in the city and not being able to distinguish oats from wheat, and of coming out to Ne - braska and being dumped onto a farm and told to run it. That was about twenty years ago. My first move was to go to the college of agriculture and holler for help, and the man to whom I went to gather information about pigs was the father of our next speaker. We surely would not have a complete agricultural program if we did not include some member of this family; the work that they have done in. this line is untold. So I do not present to you, because you already know him, but I bring before you Ex-Governor Samuel R. McKelvie, who will present the medals to the winners in our contests. PRESENTATION OF MEDALS TO CROP CONTEST WINNERS S. R. McKELVIE,, Publisher, Nebraska Farmer I wish I might spent much more time in meetings like this, where we come in contact with the most vital aspects having to do with the agricultural industry. In viewing these charts this morning and in hearing the discussions of this subject and the questions that were asked regarding the way you allow for labor on the farm, I had in mind ultimately this; that the manufacturer on the farm, and that is what the farmer is, when as efficient as the man in the factory, should figure his labor at the same wage as is received by the man in the factory, and I hold that until that can be done you cannot get away from the thing of which there is much complaint today, that is, th" variation in the exchange value of the products from the farm and those of the factory. If you have two factories lying side by side, one operates efficiently and the other less efficiently, one figuring his labor costs upon one basis and one upon another, and those two factories are obliged to exchange their products, you will find contant strife be - tween them and ultimately the efficient one will win over the other. And what you will find in industry in the city you will find upon the farm. 1 should like to feel, in contests like this, leading up finally to the progress we hope to make in our agricultural industry, that it will result in the very same thing that has brought America to its suprem - acy in industry. And America does reign supreme in industry, for which there are many reasons, reasons that are just as plain as can be when analyzed. We find the American mechanic has turned his labor to the best account by combining it with machine labor. This has greatly increased his own efficiency and increased the income of </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS^ ASSOCIATION both laborer and employer. That is the thing which seems to me im - portant upon the farm, and that is the direction in which we are tending in agriculture today. And how fine it is that the Nebraska fanner is the most efficient fanner in the world today, measured in terms of horse power. And we shall, I am sure, become more and more so. I ■ This is a wonderful record of high yields on ten acre fields. And we find that the men who had these high yields have done it at very little more cost than did the average . farmers. It is developing con - stantly among our farmers that those who are growing the largest yields are those who are getting the most rapidly ahead. We may deprecate all we choose the increased production by the individual, but when you figure as. between the two classes of men you can see that the fellows who are producing 60 to 80 bushels and more per ' acre can take a great deal less per bushel than their neighbors, and still stay in the farming game. It was shown here this morning that between the ten farmers who pvoduced average yields of 81.2 bushels per acre and five who produced only 20 bushels per acre, there was a difference of only about 30 percent in the organic matter of the soil. These high men had ' a rotation of legume crops. If we are going to increase our yields and our farm efficiency as we want to, we must of necessity have part of our land in grass. We must have a rotation of crops, in order to in - ' crease the blessings of the land to us and to generations yet unborn, in order | to save and maintain the fertility of the soil; that was done by our forefathers. . They have passed it on to you as their sons and grandsons in a better state of fertility than they found it, and that we must do for those yet to come. It can be and must be done. Think of it, in fine counties like Douglas and Cass, with some fields yielding 90 bushels or more of corn per acre; we find exactly the same type of land producing as low as 20 bushels to the acre on other fprms. Does not that pronounce a curse upon the future of American agriculture; and who is to blame but we husbandmen of the soil? I am happy to appear before you and present these medals to the winners in the wheat and corn yield contests. .'9 ■ . ■ </seg>

McARDLE, Washington, Nebraska Winner First Place— Eastern Section 1927 Corn Yield Contest My methods apply generally in my community in Douglas county. I farm an upland soil of loess origin which is similar to thousands of acres of land lying along both sides of the Missouri river. I find that farmers are an observing bunch and if a practice is found which seems to be best for a certain community soon all of .the neighbors will be using it. Most of my corn is surface planted and checked although when I can I list the level land which does not wash as I can raise listed corn with less labor. I like to plow as much as possible in the spring and then harrow promptly behind the 'plow. I make it a point to tell my men that they can drive as close as pos - sible to the buildings with the harrow and not hurt the land by over harrowing. I will if necessary stop plowing a little before quitting time at noon or at night so as to have time to harrow. I always plan to double disk and harrow just before planting. In cultivating we try to keep down the weeds as well as possible because I realize that they use water and plant food that the corn needs. We use ordinary one row cultivators. This ten acre contest field, which was really ten acres taken from a twenty acre field, had been seeded down five or six years to alfalfa. Some years back this twenty acres which was on a slope was getting pretty poor and I thought it was a shame to have land like that on the facm so I sowed part of it to alfalfa and part to red clover. I con - sider that a wise move and a double accomplishment as I built up this soil from the poorest to the best on the farm and- consequently grew this high yielding profitable crop. In the future as much as possible I intend to sow a legume crop with all my small grain, plowing this under for the most part the following spring. I plant m rows 42 inches apart and probably average a little less than three kernels per hill. The high yielding field was Reid Yellow Deni corn. </seg>

BULL, Elkhorn, Nebraska Winner of Second Place in Eastern Section The field of corn on which I was able to win second place in eastern Nebraska was located on some bottom ground about four miles south-east of Elkhorn. This piece of ground is quite often flooded which inj a measure accounts for its fertility. It was first broken out five years ago, till then had been used as a pasture, having a very good sod of blue grass and white clover. It has been continually planted to corn since. This crop was listed about May 12. The seed was planted quite close, a kernel about every sixteen inches. The seed corn was of my own jselection and raising, it was gathered early the previous fall. It was a dimple dent type of yellow dent, a type of com found very satisfactory in this section. The field was disced before listing and the first two j cultivations were with a two row listed corn cultivator or go - devil. The third cultivation was with a two row cultivator. The three cultivations being all that were necessary to keep the weeds down. In a discussion concerning a crop like this we should try to ac - count for the yield in order to derive any benefit from the contest. I think the factors having a bearing on the yield might be divided into those over which we have no direct control, such as rainfall and climate in general, and those &lt;jve can control as fertility, seed and cul - tural methods. While we cannot control the climatic conditions we can in some measure take advantage of them or lessen their damage. Through good cultural methods and a soil plentifully supplied with organic matter we can get along without very much rainfall. This was brought jout this year, when this crop was grown with a rainfall of less than sixteen inches for the year at my place. Quite a little of those sixteen inches fell after the crop was grown. The soil in this field was quite plentifully supplied with organic matter and had in previous years been deeply plowed so that it was able to store and hold a large amount of the moisture we had in the prcc-clint- fall and spring. The dry weather made it possible to keep the weeds down in good shape, eliminating another source of moisture loss. The lessons I have learned from this contest, regarding the raising of corn are briefly this: that the relation of yield to organic matter s almost in direct proportion and that to raise crop economically we must have a high yield. The presence of organic matter requires that we add to the soil that which will -add organic matter and nitrogen as fast as it is used with a little surplus to build up the soil. Legumes and manure will do this faster and better than anything else. Live - stock and legumes, alfalfa, sweet clover and other clovers on a farm are the source of economical corn production and the highest market is here produced. </seg>

The ground is har - rowed just before the corn comes up which helps to kill the weeds and loosens the ground, if the weeds grow fast the ground is harrowed for the second time. The corn is cultivated three times instead ol four as I find the fourth cultivation is injurious to the roots. HOW I WON FIRST IN THE IRRIGATED SECTION OF THE CORN YIELD CONTEST GERALD WILCOX; McCook, Nebraska My prize 10 acreB of corn was not given extra care but just the same attention, as was given all my corn. The land where I had my corn is the same land which produced my prize corn in 1925. In 1926 this field was m potatoes. They made 200 bushels per acre. This ground was worked three times m the fall; once with the potato digger and once with the lister to get all the potatoes. I harrowed once after using the digger and once after using the lister. In working the ground m this manner the ground was m fine shape for the corn crop m the spring. We' also got 95 bushels more potatoes. Last spring I disked the ground with a Number 20 once over. May the first and May the twelfth I harrowed cross ways. May the seventeenth I listed with a two row lister. The lister was set 32 inches apart. On June 22 I cultivated with a sled two row machine. This machine takes all the weeds out and throws fresh dirt to the corn. "In laying the corn by I use the largest shovels I can get for my cultivator. I cultivate two rows at once with a single row cultivator. How can I.' do that? jlt works- fine where I have my rows 32 inches apart By turning one shovel one way and the other the other way, it works fine. By having the rows close together the corn shades the ground better, the water also soaks into the ground and does the corn more good. I watered the corn July 23, once over and that was all it got The kind of corn I plant is a long yellow dent. I do not care how long or how large the ear is, if it will mature, the longer the ear the better. I aim to save my seed corn m the fall. I have already tested my seed for this year and practically every kernel sprouted. </seg>

Cozad, Nebraska In telling you how I raised my ten acres of corn, I will- first say that this is on irrigated ground. This ground has been in beets, potatoes and corn, the three preceeding years. Therefore was plowed deep two years, kept clean, and well ir - rigated. I have an early variety of large yellow corn, seed always picked from the field m the fall before frost and hung up to dry. In preparing the ground, I cut the stalks and single disced. I might also state I used two-row machinery all the way through. I listed this plot on May 22, the rows being forty inches apart. I used a ten inch drop plate and covered the rom one-half inch deep. During the first and second cultivation I throw all the dirt to the corn that it will stand. Then the third cultivation I use the disc instead of inside shovels, ridging dirt around stalks pretty well and leaving aisle as level as possible. By using this method of culti - vation, &lt;luring irrigation the water does not get up on stalks and still soaks up the ground more by having the aisles level. I never leave water on a run more than three hours. If necessary, water again as it is hard on the eround if the water is left so long and not handled properly. I might also state that I think good seed, and work done on time are m my opinion the essentials of a good corn crop. W. R. Nicholson GROWING CORN IN WESTERN NEBRASKA W. R.

ARNOLD DEERING, Norfolk Winner in Madison Com Yield Contest First of all I want to congratulate all the other winners in this contest. My luck has been usually good, being a winner for two successive years, in the state high yielding contest in Madison County. My place is located three miles west of Norfolk on High - way No. 8 and m the Elkhorn river valley. Now I did not give my ten acre contest field any better care than the rest of my fields. The soil is black bottom land. Some of this land has been farmed for fifty-five years. This ten acre field had been m sweet clover pasture for four years, and broke over m the fall of 1925, and then planted m corn for two years. I sow sweet clover with all my small grain, and keep enough stock on hand to get enough manure to cover forty acres. I usually have 100 acres m corn. The corn that I used two years m my contest is an early yellow dimple dent. I try to pick much of my seed m the fall. But the early variety matures well and I have had very good results picking seed l out of the cribs. I check most of my corn using a three foot four check set I use a eight inch furrow opener set shallow just to make a track about four inches deep. That is to get all the seed m moist ground. After the corn is up I take a harrow and roll the loose dirt around the corn. This helps to keep ■ the fields clean from weeds because you can not grow good corn, were you have a weed crop. I plow about seven inches deep, harrow after plowing:, and if not too crowded with work disc and harrow before planting. The main thing is to have good seed, good fertile land, good weather, and to do your work on time. It did look bad last spring with our wet fields, and all our spring work coming on at once. This weather man, Mr. Brown predicted that 1927 would be a year without a summer. But as it happened to be the most prosperous year for Nebraska. </seg>

The soil is a rather light loam. The land was double-disked about April 15th, I then listed the corn on May 13th, after the corn was up about two inches I went over it with a two row go - devil throwing the banks out. The season was very backward and I wanted to get the banks worked down as soon as possible, so as soon as I got over the field once I went over it again throwing the dirt out again and running the shovels beside the corn. After this was done I waited about a week and gave the corn a double harrowing, this brought the ridges nearly level. In about a week I went over it again with a go-devil and pulled the dirt to the corn. As soon as the corn would do to lay by, I went over it with my cultivator. I usually grow corn on land that has been m small grain for two years previous. Most of my seed is gathered early m the fall, I use medium sized cars that grew well m comparison with others for seed.

W. W. BURR, Chairman, Dept. of Agronomy We are all of us familiar with the phrase "bank balance". To meditate upon our individual bank balances may be pleasant or may cause a peculiar feeling of uneasiness,— depending upon circumstances. It does not take a Mathematician to tell us what will happen if we continually draw upon our bank balance without replenishing the supply. Sooner or later our banker will use red ink to notify us of insufficient funds or an overdraft. It is a perfectly simple matter and we all understand it; — that if we are to maintain our balance we must deposit into the bank an amount equaling our withdrawals. While we are all familiar with the above illustration, perhaps very few of us have ever thought of our soils as a bank. In many respects ■ the two are similar. In the one we have our working capital in the form of cash and we draw on it as needs be by writing checks. In the other we have assets which, while not cash, have a cash value and are to us as fanners an indispensible part of our working capital. In • this bank we have organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and numerous other assets necessary to the production of crops. In the first bank if we want to use some of our capital, we write a check. In the second bank we check against our balance by cultivating the soil and by planting, and harvesting our crop. The process thus far is quite familiar, but there is one important difference, — namely, our bankers. In the first case we can draw freely and even exhaust our funds before receiving from our banker the unmistakable warn - ing, — or in kniency he may even violate the law and allow an overdraft, but Dame Nature never. She begins to send put warnings early, before the danger point has been reached. She speaks gentle, at first,— so gently that her warnings are quite generally unheeded. Perhaps un- </seg>
            <seg id="p186">KKPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE known except to the one who has trained himself to see her signals, — a slight dropping off in yield, a little more difficulty in tillage or the formation of little gully. As our balance in the soil bank continues to - ward depletion, her warnings become more clear and evident, and there is a point beyond which she will not permit, — for Dame Nature allows no overdrafts. 1 wonder if we appreciate the immense capitalization we have in this "Soil Bank of Nebraska." The figures are astounding. We doubt - less realize that the most important resource in the State of Nebraska is the soil. According to the 1920 federal census the value of Ne - braska farm land, exclusive of improvements and equipment, was three and one third billion dollars, — or 80% of the entire capitalization of her agriculture. This immense capital certainly deserves careful super - vision. These figures in dollars stagger us and we may not fully ap - preciate them. Let us look at it from another angle. Nebraska is 15th in size among the States containing 76,510 square miles. Of this some 26,000 are known as loess soils, — recognized as among the most productive soils of the world, and famed for its comparative ease of tillage. 7,000 square miles in S. £. Nebraska are covered with glacial drift, — formed from parent material which was rich in the elements of ' plant food. Some 16,000 square miles is high plains soil, rich, friable and generally deep, — capable of abundant production when moisture con - ditions are favorable, and some 6,000 square miles is first and second bottom or terrance soil, generally recognized for their productivity. In fact all of the State, excepting the Sand Hills, and some minor areas of out-wash soils, which are droughty are recognized as A-l. That these soils are productive is evidenced by a study of the agricultural statistics, to determine the relative rank of Nebraska among the 48 states. In considering these statistics we should realize that Nebraska does not have a sufficient rainfall over a considerable portion of her area. In fact the rainfall here at Lincoln only averages around 28 inches, — scarcely more than enough to meet the current needs of the ] vegetation. Westward it becomes less and less until an average of around 15 inches is reached. Furthermore, approximately % of the state is covered by sand hills, which is limited largely to meat produc - tion. Yet, with these two admitted handicaps, Nebraska during the past 8 years has averaped fourth among the 48 states in the value of her crops r&gt;nd livestock products. And 4 times during those 8 years she has been 4th in the total value of these products. This speaks well for the inherent productivity of Nebraska soils, the greatest factor of which— considering the climate — is their depth, which allows the ac - cumulation of rpserve moisture in the subsoil to carry the crop through periods of drouth. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">■.-■ ■■;.■ NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ; . JThe working capital-or our free balance in this bank-is the ability «f the soil to produce crops. It is represented both in the Siri-I T Plant f °° d ** the 80il contains &lt;»&gt;•&gt; the ease ,wt ? 6 f 1S "^P" 1^ ti«age instruments. The very fact that Nebraska soils have befn and are so productive is, in a way, a danger. It lulls us into a seny-unconsciousness of the fact that the soils may be and are being depleted. Let us examine, briefly, just what the present condition of the soil is. Our soils certainly are not 'Wo out. The rank of the state in agricultural production tells us that. But it is folly, and we are merely trying to fool ourselves, when w|e say they will not wear out or that we are maintaining their virgin productivity. It is true that agricul - tural statistics do not show a great deal of decline in the average pro - duction, but the production has (been kept up by the introduction of better adapted and more productive strains of crops, better tillage machinery, better tillage practices, and a whole lot more work than the pioneer farmers put upon this land. The observation and experiences 01 the men who have occupied the various farms in the state for many years is that the soil has lost, in I a measure, its ability to produce The yields have grown less and the "soil has become more difficult to ' ■■■-.' ■ ■'•' ' ' - : - \ V '■'-■■■ i : • </seg>
            <seg id="p188">KKl'ORT OF NBBRAS1CA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE handle. This fact is also borne out by the investigations made at the Experiment Station. In our work with soils we have found that ap - proximately a thousand pounds of the organic matter of the soil arid 50 pounds of nitrogen, are dissipated each year through the cultivation of the land and the production of the crops. In the work of our soils department is a very interesting and instructive study of 91 fields on Nebraska farms which have been under cultivation from 3 to 60 years. The analysis of the soils of these fields shows a correlation between the length of time of cultivation and the loss of organic matter. Nine fields cultivated from 3 to 7 years, show 6% per cent loss of organic matter. Nine fields cultivated 8 to 15 years show a loss of 14 % per cent. Twelve fields cultivated 17 to 30 years show an average loss of 25.6 per cent; 25 fields under cultiva - tion 32 to 43 years show a loss of 26.2 per cent. Twelve fields culti - vated from 46 to 60 years show an average loss of 28 per cent. And fifteen fields cultivated from 30 to 60 years, but badly eroded, show an average loss of 56 per cent, of their organic matter. Among these farms are nine fields cultivated from 30 to 47 years that have had occasional applications of manure and have been rotated with red clover, alfalfa or sweet clover, that show an average loss of only 6% per cent, — or no more than the newer soils cultivated from 3 to 7 years. The nitrogen content of the soil is approximately ! %o of the organic content and its loss is in direct ratio with that of the organic matter. We do not feel that it is a practical proposition to aim to maintain the organic content of the soil at its virgin percent. Under the thousands of years of natural grass cover the organic con - tent was built up to a point where when put under cultivation there was more than could be held under conditions of cultivation. Due to the degree of decomposition of the soil, or to some factor unknown, there is very rapid depletion when the soil is first put under cultivation, but after a few years a point is reached where the depletion is more gradual. This is probably the approximate point of practical main - tenance and 1 an", not prepared to say just what it is on a percentage basis. We do know that when it lowers from this point there is a decline in yield. As I said before the nitrogen content of the soil is correlated with the organic matter. From all of our observations, investigations- and experiences we have concluded that organic matter is the most im- : portant constituent of Nebraska soils and that its depletion is our greatest soil problem. Organic matter is not a direct plant. food, but it affects the soil both chemically and physically. It carries the nitrogen of the soil, and nitrogen is an essential plant food. Without it plants cannot grow. The shortage of nitrates in the soil is what makes the crop look sickly and yellow and stunted, — as we often see </seg>
            <seg id="p189">•NEBRASKA' CROP GROWERS ASSOCIATION I • them on old fields or eroded hillsides. And the presence of abundant nitrates gives the crops a dark green color that we associate with healthy growth. Furthermore, the organic matter is the food of bac - teria that are essential in making plant food available. These bacteria are the cooks that put the raw food into condition for plant "use. In the process of the decay of organic matter some organic acids are given. off that react with the mineral elements of the soil, releasing mineral plant food. From the physical standpoint the organic matter is fully as im - portant. It is that in the soil which gives it the dark, rich looking color, and jthe crumbly, granular, friable condition. Without it the soil would jbe merely a mass of pulverized rock, incapable of being brought under satisfactory tilth! As it becomes depleted, soils be - come less friable, more sticky, harder to work, stickier and stiffer when wet, and harder and cloddier when dry. As it is depleted, the soils shrink more and consequently crack more and wash easier. The greatest solution to the prevention of the tremendous loss through soil erosion in this state is the maintenance of organic matter. I repeat that the organic content of the soil is its most important factor. I do not want to give the impression that we feel that Nebraska soils have worn out That is far from true. There are however, many fields and farms where the soil depletion is a matter of serious con - cern and throughout the major portion of the eastern part of the state the question of soil fertility is already being felt That these soils have been and many of them still are good, has been demonstrated. That they will wear out and are wearing out, may not be so clear. We sometimes wonder when we ride through southeastern Nebraska and see the soil washing and great gullies cutting down through, some of the most productive agricultural soils to be found anywhere, if the people really realize what an asset they have in the soil. We have been fortunate as it has not been necessary for us to apply lime in order to grow legumes on most of our land. We are not required to use commercial fertilizer,— our soils are generally well supplied with potassium and fairly well supplied with phosphorus. The farmers of the east frequently supply from three to ten dollars per acre of commercial fertilizers annually, depending upon the crop to be grown. |This adds that much more to the cost of production. In our work with commercial fertilizers we have not found much response to their use, but we have found abundant response to the building up of the organic content of the soil and consequently increasing not only the total nitrogen of the soil, but ■ the- rate of nitrification. If we are to maintain the productivity of our soils, we must give attention to the matter of soil maintenance. Doubtless you are all familiar with the methods. It is merely more legumes, more grass. and more livestock. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Land laid down to grass accumulates organic content. The legumes not only add organic matter but they are especially rich in nitrogen and well rotted barnyard manure is the best fertilizer ever found for our conditions. I need not go into what these things do for the soil. They merely ' correct the various things that we mentioned as happening with the depletion of organic matter. It is generally recognized now that the growing of sweet clover increases the yield of the crops following. Eighty-eight farmers replying to a questionnaire a year or so ago esti- • mated the increased yields of corn, wheat and oats, to be from 50 to 60 per cent, following sweet clover. At the Agronomy Farm carefully conducted experiments show that proper applications of manure have consistently increased the yield of standard crops. But as still further evidence, many men in the state are actually practicing rotation with legumes and the use of barnyard manure, and are maintaining the productivity of their land.

We might also say that good fertile soil contains in perfect form all the con - stituents of fertility, and in keeping up the fertility these constituents must be replaced and maintained. And one of our greatest problems is to find the remedy for decreased production, if we have any, or how to keep up the fertility. We all know this is a wonderful country; we all have in our com - munities farms of high fertility and farms of low fertility; we have them in your community, and in ours. Across the road from home is a nice level farm, well improved, wonderful buildings, and for the last twelve years, with the exception of forty acres which has been rented out and which has been used by the Weather Bureau station, the rest of this land was rented to a neighbor, without an acre being sown down to legume or an ounce of manure put onto it, and the renter this year finds it pretty hard to pay his rent. His average yield is much less than the yield of those who use legumes and livestock. Most renters have little regard for or interest in the welfare of the soil which they are working; and you can scarcely blame them, because under our short term system of tenancy which we have throughout the corn belt the renter gets very little compensation for improving the productivity of the soil. „■■■ •■ • ■ ■ .■- '..■'■"-..-.■.-•.■-- ■-'■'■-'" ■ . ■ -.]l F'.g. 26— "Livi stock needs legumes, legumes need livestock, the farm needs them both," said J.

            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION maintained a large herd of dairy cattle, and each year has plowed and sowed more grain, carefully stacking his barley and oat straw, using every bit of it with his dairy herd, and his farm is in just as high a state of fertility as it was twenty years ago. Some distance northeast of this is a farm owned by Gelston Brothers, shorthorn breeders, where they have kept a large herd of about one hundred to one hundred and ten breeding cows. Consequently it has taken quite a bit of hay for these cattle; and every bit of the straw has been used. And every part of that farm today is in as high a state of productivity as it was years ago. At home I found I could not live on a farm without livestock. Ever since I was a kid Dad had livestock, and it was up to me to make a record of the calves, and register and care for them. I have found that legumes need livestock, and livestock needs legumes, and farm needs both. We have quite a bit of roughage around the farm, such as straw, hay, corn stalks, and some hay that has been hulled for seed crops which can be used to great advantage by livestock, which other - wise of course would go to waste. So a person must have feed, and we have to have hay, and each year I have considered it my duty to keep up the home place by putting a certain amount of acreage of legume. I have one eighty on which I have in the past year been spreading as much manure on as I could; a year ago I got it into my head that each year twenty acres would be sown down to legume, and last year I sowed twenty acres, and this year" twenty acres, and next year I will sow another twenty and when I get the eighty sowed I will start over. Several years ago I was farming fifty acres of land laying up on perfectly level ground and twenty acres which sloped tiff toward the bottom. In farming this I was really ashamed of the twenty acres, which was the very poorest part of it; and it occurred to me that occasionally a thing of this kind is beneficial, to find that you have, some poor land on your place land which is not producing, because it gives an incentive to a person to go ahead and try to increase the fertility of this land. The north ten acres of this was sowed to alfalfsi and the south ten acres a year or so later was sowed to red clover aid timothy, and this past year I put Oils held in the ten acre yield contest and won first place in eastern Ne - braska .witt a 92 bushel yield. I am convinced that if soil is run down it can be built up. There is no em l to the productivity of our soil, with the proper treatment. It can always be built up again. A good many neighbors in our community now are sowing down their ground, even the rerters, the landlords furnishing the seed. They are sowing the land diwn to sweet- clover and plowing it down in the spring and in that wiy return a good deal of fertilizine matter to the soil. " " ' ' • .' 1 ' * </seg>

I thank you. LONG TIME LOANS OR LOANS THAT NEVER COME DUE P. L. GADD1S, Chief Appraiser, Lincoln Joint Stock Land Bank The Nebraska farmer of forty years ago required practically no capital. He could acquire land through the homestead law or by putting out a few acres of trees. Nature furnished him building material in the shape of logs and sod. The farmer's equipment was also simple at that time, usually consisting of a few cheap horses and some walking implements of simple construction. Running expenses usually were light, much of the living was produced on the farm and such as must be bought was obtained largely in exchange for the farmer's produce. Not infrequently housewives of that day had a credit at the stores having sold more produce at certain times of the year than was necessary to meet the household expenses. Farm labor bills were very light then due to the fact that the fanner exchanged work with his neighbors when he had special jobs to do that required considerable help. There has been a great transformation since then. Land has taken on value depending upon its productiveness and the demand for land. The farmer thinks that he can no longer get along with the buildings that used to be considered comfortable, but in many cases he provides a home comparable with city homes and he cannot in • any wise be blamed for this provided he can afford such a home. Equipment is much more extensive and costly now as the old walking implements have given place to larger and better riding machinery which in many cases is pulled by tractors. In addition to this the farmer goes from place to place in a car instead of with wagon and horses. Living con - ditions on the farm are more nearly on a city basis than they have ever been. The average farmer raises but little of his living on the farm. It is not uncommon for the farmer's wife to buy meat at the meatmarket and vegetables in cans which was unheard of three or four decades ago. Farm labor is often quite an item on the farm as hours are shorter, wages higher and less work is exchanged than was formerly the case. And so within the span of a lifetime the farmer who could not have sold out for $1,000 and whose turnover was probably less than $500 a year finds himself now operating a' farm </seg>

            <seg id="p196">RKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE But before 1916 interest rates were high to farmers and loan con - ditions unsatisfactory. The term was too short to permit payment of the loan from the earnings of the farm. A man must have funds com - ing in from outside or must expect to renew his loan several times be - fore he finally paid it off. Commissions were high and the exact con - ditions or even the possibility of renewal uncertain. The farm loan machinery was inflexible and functioned slowly. Reason for Federal Farm Loan Act It was these unsatisfactory conditions that lead congress to send a commission to Europe to investigate long time loans and, upon the return and reporting of the commission, to pass on June 28, 1916, the Federal Farm Loan Act. This act provided for loans, made for agri - cultural purposes only, ranging in length of time from thirty-three to forty years to be repaid on the amortization plan, that is, to be paid back in small installments along with the interest payments. A glance at an amortization table shows how these installments are paid and that with each payment on the principal the interest on the balance of the loan is reduced so that more of the next payment can be ap - plied on the principal. The payments remain the same throughout the life of the loan. Just a little extra effort to pay an additional tworthirds of one per cent to one per cent will retire the loan. Two to three cents per day for each thousand dollars borrowed is sufficient, or as one woman said, "An egg a day will clear the mortgage away." To furnish these loans banks of two kinds were provided, the federal land banks and the joint stock land banks. The federal land banks are purely cooperative institutions owned and operated by the borrowers who are stockholders investing to the extent of five per cent of the proceeds of their loans. They receive dividends depending in amount upon the earnings of the bank. For the operation of federal land banks the United States is divided into twelve districts with a federal land bank in each district. We arp in the eighth district comprised of the states of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota and Wyoming the bank being located at Omaha. </seg>

            <seg id="p198">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE The joint stock land banks are operated with capital furnished by out - side investors, that is, the borrower from these banks is not required to invest in stock although he may do so if he desires. He has no responsibility beyond his own loan and unless he does invest in stock he has no voice in the management of the bank. The number of joint stock land banks is not limited as in the case of the federal land banks. There may be two or more operating in the same state in com - petition with each other. Each joint stock land bank is allowed as territory the state in which it is located and one adjacent state addi - tional. There are two joint stock land banks operating in Nebraska, the Lincoln and the Fremont. The Fremont Joint Stock Land Bank was formerly operated from Fremont but is now managed from the branch office at Lincoln. During the first few years of their existence the federal land banks were not permitted to lend more than $10,000 to one individual but that limit was raised to $25,000. Joint stock land banks have since their organization been permitted to lend up to $50,000 to a single individual. Loans are not permitted to exceed fifty per cent of the value of the land and twenty per cent of the permanent insurable im - provements. The valuations on which, loans are based must be made by federal appraisers who are appointed by the Farm Loan Board at Washington which has supervision of the entire system. How Federal Loans May be Secured A farmer wishing to secure a loan through a federal land bank must join a local association which is managed by a secretary-trea - surer. He places his application with the secretary-treasurer and if the local loan committee approves of the application it is forwarded to the federal land bank for consideration. A farmer wishing to bor - row fiem :i joint stock land bank inquires of his local banker or iv riles t-.&gt; a land bank operating in his territory and secures an applica* - tion blank. He may be referred to a local agent who solicits business in his vicinity or he may be sent an application blank to be filled out and forwarded direct to the bank. After the application reaches the federal or joint stock land bank the procedure is the same. The ap - plication is placed in the hands of a federal appraiser who examines the security and if values and conditions surrounding the loan are satisfactory he recommends a loan. When the appraiser's report reaches the bank it is examined by an executive committee appointed for the purpose, and if it is approved the secretary-treasurer or local ajrent and the applicant are advised of the amount. If the amount' is acceptable the applicant then sends his abstract of title which is ex - amined by the attorney for the land bank, and if the title is found satisfactory the note and mortgage papers are forwarded with the draft for closing the loan. </seg>

In fact, we are glad to cooperate with our borrowers in reducing their loans as fast as they may be able. At the first option date if a bank is lending at a lower rate and the loan has been carried satis - factorily, the borrower is given a reduced rate agreement without ex - pense to him. The federal farm loan system has been in operation about ten years. For about two years of that time business was suspended be - cause of the fact thaf the constitutionality of the Farm Loan Act was being tested. In about eight years of actual operation an immense amount of money has been furnished to the farmers of the United States. On October 31, 1927 the federal land banks had outstanding loans in the amount of $1,147,135,166.89 while the joint stock land banks had loans in the amount of $610,049,918.90. The entire system had loans amounting to more than one and three-fourths billions. In Nebraska the two joint stock land banks have in about seven and a half years of activity made loans amounting to $35,196,690. I do not know the exact amount that the federal land bank has loaned in this state but it is considerably more than the joint stock land banks have loaned. All Borrowers Profit Some farmers will perhaps say that the federal farm loan system has been of no help to them as they have not been able to get loans in the amount that they need. It is not infrequently true that a farmer's requirements are beyond us. At the same time those very farmers are benefitting greatly by the government lttans. The very fact that this system has placed many millions of dollars in farm loans in Nebraska has released other money to be loaned to those whose requirements aro larger than our standards of lending will permit us to meet. There has br-en a reduciion in commission charges and there are better terms on farm loans than was the case before this system was placed in operation. What of the future with repect to farm loans? One thing certain, the farmer is demanding a long time loan and most of the farm loan business of the future will be in ihat form. Some agencies outside of the federal system are now offering loans on a long time basis. It is probable that most lending agencies who expect to compete for farm loans will eventually find it necessary to offer such loans! After the federal loan system, is thoroughly seasoned it will be even more effec - tive than it is now. The fact that agriculture is becoming more stabil - ized and that farmers are learning better how to meet all kinds of conditions and still produce something is going to add to the security </seg>

With the spirit of speculation curbed, farm business stabilized, general farm - ing conditions and rural life satisfying, and with plenty of competition in the farm loan field the farmer of the future should not have to worry but ithat he will be adequately financed. FEDERAL INTERMEDIATE CREDIT BANKS A. KOPPERUD, Vice Pres. Intermediate Credit Bank, Omaha Congress- first created the Federal Reserve Banks, which were to aid banks in taking care of short-time loans. Then Congress created the Federal Land Banks, which made long-time, low-interest loans on land. It was found that, in spite of the two agencies previously men - tioned, . the farmers could rot be - properly financed on their produc - ing the marketing loans. The depression that followed the war showed more clearly than ever that there was great need for a system of credit that would enable the stockmen and farmers to properly com - plete their operations when once undertaken. At that time many borrowers found themselves forced to sacrifice the accumulation of years in order to raise the cash to irjeet short time obligations at a time when their stock or crops were not finished and in shape to bring the jbest return on the market. This condition affected everyone in the business, as the markets were flooded and even the producers who were free from. debt suffered from the competition of these forced sales. To meet this situation, Congress passed the law creating Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, which became effective March 4, 1923. The farmer must have credit at sufficiently low interest rates anJ for a long enough time so that he can properly equip his farm with buildings and- machinery, raise his crops, and breed and mature his live - stock at the lowest possible cost. It is a dangerous practice for the country bank, subject to the rise and fall of deposits, to loan its money to breeders needing two to three years to mature their stock. The practice is also dangerous from the standpoint of the farmer and ranch - man, as often the bank must call its loan at a time when it means a big loss to sell unmatured livestock or to sell on an unfavorable markrt. The Intermediate Credit Bank fills a gap between the commercial bank and the Federal Land Bank not now served, and will be of great assistance to the farmer and ranchman for the reason that it can finance the farmer successsfully in his production loans. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Organization of Credit Banks The Intermediate Credit Banks are owned entirely by the Federal Government which furnished five million dollars capital for each of the twelve banks. In addition to this capital, each bank is authorized to issue tax-exempt debentures up to fifty million dollars to provide addi - tional funds to carry on its operations. The debentures are secured by the notes that the Intermediate Credit Bank discounts, and they enjoy a ready market at a very low rate. Consequently the source of supply of Credit Bank funds is comparatively stable and borrowers who are making use of its services may feel confident that they will be able to hold their products until ready for market if proper care and attention is given. Debentures can be sold for such maturities, up to three years, as are needed to carry the loans through. Intermediate Credit Banks cannot make loans direct to individuals, but may purchase notes of acceptable borrowers when properly en - dorsed and guaranteed by banks or corporations qualified and approved as rediscounting concerns. Corporations should be organized locally, under state laws, with a minimum capital of $10,000.00. These corpor - ations can make loans to farmers on their livestock, which loans will be carried by the Intermediate Credit Bank, on the endorsement of the corporation, until the livestock is fit for marketing. Loans can also be made on storage checks or warehouse receipts covering grain, and to co-operative marketing associations. A corporation may loan to any one borrower an amount not ex - ceeding fifty per cent of its unimpaired capital and suplus. The amount which it may rediscount with the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank may not exceed ten times the amount of its unimpaired capital and surplus. Banks are restricted to the usual legal limit as fixed by national and state banking laws. Requirements for Loans There are certain general requirements which all paper handled must meet. Intermediate Credit Banks are permanent institutions and their usefulness will depend to a great extent on the soundness of their loans. Notes must be secured by a reasonable amount of acceptable security. The security must be livestock v&gt;r agricultural products which will ordinarily be marketable to liquidate the loan within a reasonable time. The margin required will depend to a considerable extent on the borrower's individual financial statement and the hazard. Short time loans running less than six months are not eligible. Interest rates are governed by the rate paid on Federal Intermediate Credit Bank deben - tures, but the maximum rate is fixed by law and will usually be com - paratively low. At the present time the rate is 4%% to the Discount Corporation and from 6 to 7% to the farmer. </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Federal Intermediate Credit Banks are in no way a temporary relief measure, but a permanent addition to the financial structure of the country. The Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Omaha is in position to handle suitable loans for borrowers throughout its district, which covers Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Its officers • are familiar with customs and needs of the stockmen and farmers and are anxious to be of the greatest possible service. Borrowers are urged to get in touch with eligible endorsing corporations when they are able to use funds profitably. In case there is no local corporation, various larger corporations throughout the district are available. The Intermediate Credit Bank will be very glad to have an opportunity to put borrowers in touch with the nearest and most suitable concern. We have frequently been told by lending companies or agencies that if they had to return to the old method of doing business — rediscounting or selling their paper to commercial banks— they would go out- of busi - ness voluntarily. illustration of Financing I wish to recite an incident] showing the .practical benefit of Federal Intermediate Credit Bank financing to the livestock breeder and grower: In the fall of 1924 Mr. A had 2700, 2 year old steers. In addition to these steers he. had between 3000 and. 4000 other cattle on his ranch, and had all the equipment, ifeed and labor services nesessary to handle these 2700 steers as well as the other 4000 cattle. The total cost of running these steers elver another year would not have been more than $15 apiece at the veVy highest, probably not more than $10 or $12 apiece, since he had all the grass, hay and other feed necessary, and had to maintain his equipment and keep his help in order to run the rest of his outfit. However, his bank required that he reduce his indebtedness, and he had to dispose of these steers. He shipped them out in the fall of 1924 and they brought $48.00 apiece. One iof his neighbors had a string of the same brand of cattle, which were brought up from Texas at the same time as yearlings. The neighborj was able to carry his stuff over, and sold them in the fall of 1925 as threes, to net him about $98.00 apiece. Mr. A, then, received (after deducting the cost of carrying them over) a net amount of $35 apiece less for his steers than he would have received had he been able to carry them over; in other words, he sacrificed from $90,000 to $100,000 profit which he might have had had he been able to carry these 2700 steers over. ■ : •■ ••■■-!■■■ ; ' T ■ ■ '!'.■■■ . ■"-•■'■..

Intermediate Credit is becoming a real source of funds for livestock - breeders, ranchmen, feeders, and dairy men, according to the last re - port of the 12 Intermediate Credit Banks. In fact, the great majority of paper rediscounted by the Intermediate Credit Banks west of Chicago and New Orleans is paper which represents loans by livestock loan companies, agricultural credit corporations or other lending institutions. Each year since these government operated banks were started in 1923 (.he amounts of loans on live stock of one kind or another has increased. During that time they have loaned all told approximately $170,000,000 to rediscountinp agencies, the major part of which had livestock as a basis of the loans. They now have oustanding about $25,000,000 on live stock, compared with a total of $40,000,000 on all agricultural paper rediscounted. The service rendered lending agencies and the borrowers is so satisfactory that these banks are bound to increase in popularity and usefulness as the demand for more than 6 months' loan increases. The early days of financing the live stock business or cattlemen was really about as colorful as the history of the western cattle busi - ness itself. Eastern money was borrowed at low rates by middle-west commission firms and re-lent to cattlemen, largely to insure the ship - ment of their cattle to these agencies. This type of cattle lending concern is largely passed. Likewise, the big packers were prominent in this field oi live stock credit, through their livestock Loan Companies, but they too have mostly retired. The War Finance Corporation was an emergency activity. It stayed with the live stock industry remarkably well, aiding thousands of ranchmen and farmers to pull out when they were virtually in - solvent and at the same time saved many banks. In fact, about the only War Finance Corporation money outstanding today is that which is tied up in defunct banks. Thus it was only natural that a number of livestock lending agencies having received loans from the War Finance Corporation should turn to the Intermediate Credit. Banks as an agency particularly suited to take their cattle and other live stock and sheep paper.

This wouldn't finance all of agriculture, but it would make quite a splash in] the financial pool of the country should it be called upon to fall in. They have lent, since establishment in 1923, a little over two - thirds of ■ a billion dollars to co-operatives and rediscounted agricul - tural paper, including live stock, totalling a third of a billion dollars. It is roughly estimated that more than a million farmers have thus been aided. About 557 agricultural credit corporations have been or - ganized specifically with a view of utilizing funds from these banks. &lt; During 1926 rediscounts totalled approximately 40,000,000; these were divided roughly into $15,000,000 on cattle, $10,000,000 on other livestock, mainly sheep, and $15,000,000 for other general agricultural purposes. The latter loans were largest in the South Atlantic States, and Louisiana. Marketing Organizations Can Use Funds Farmers all over America are studying the problems of co-oper - ative marketing much more earnestly than ever before and a few words about how Intermediate Credit Banks have financed co-operative mar - keting-associations would undoubtedly be of interest. The (South Dakota Wheat Growers Association with headquarters at Aberdeen has taken advantage of the facilities of the Intermediate Credit Bank of Omaha. It advanced to this co-operative about $500, - 000.00 in 1924, $800,000.00 in 1925, and $550,000.00 in 1927. Thus these growers jWere assured of an early payment by the cooperative on the wheat which they pooled, and the organization was enabled to carry out its program of orderly marketing. The- association pledged the - storage tickets received from members to this bank as collateral security for the loans; in other words, the warehouse receipts. The loans amounted to approximately 75% of the low Minneapolis cash sale price, less the cost of getting it to Minneapolis. Final settlement was made by the association after the wheat was sold, each grower getting the average of the pool, according to grade. We jhave just received a very interesting chart showing the rela - tion between the market price of No. 1, Dark Northern, the pool price, and the rate at which the wheat was delivered to the pool in 1925-26 and also for the previous year. For the year closed in June, 1926, the pool price was about $1.64. From August, 1925, to June, 1926, the market price was below the pool price for six months and it was above it in December, January and August and June. In the latter months the pool did not have much wheat to sell, but during the peak of the year— December, January and February— it sold 36% of the pool and in March and April 20% more when the price was not far from the average! </seg>
            <seg id="p206">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE If the growers had been marketing their wheat during the monthl succeeding harvest, they would have taken the lowest price of the year. They delivered to the pool 37% of their wheat in September when the price touched the bottom— around $1.38— and 19% more before it had risen to $1.50. The chart for 1924-25 is fully as. encouraging. This is a graphic illustration of the kind of service which it was intended the Intermediate Credit Banks were to render to cooperative marketing organizations. In this district the South Dakota Wool Growers Association located at Brookings and the Wyoming' Wool Growers Association, with headquarters at McKinley, have utilized $2,000,000.00 of Intermediate Credit money for orderly marketing of wool. The loans to wool grower's organizations have made it possible for them to secure an average price for their warehoused and orderly marketed wool which has netted them more than they would have obtained if they had been forced tu sell early in the season. Although the alfalfa seed growers have only borrowed a relatively small amount, they are satisfied with their results. It permits them to ohtain a liberal advance on their seed as soon as it is properly ware - housed. In loaning these funds to cooperative marketing agencies, the Omaha bank has a very satisfactory record so far as payment of principal and interest is concerned. The various advances have been liquidated within normal seasonal marketing periods of the different commodities. The Intermediate Credit Bank stands ready to finance other co - operatives when they desire the money and can offer as collateral ap - proved commodities stored in acceptable warehouses. Of the list of products approved by the Federal Farm Loan Board, aside from those already lent upon, there are relatively few which are handled cooper - atively in this territory. The list includes, in addition to wheat, wool and alfalfa seed, such commodities as cotton, tobacco, rice, hay, olive oil, prunes, raisins, canned fruit and vegetables, red top seed, maple syrup, broom corn and nuts. Other commodities are being added from time to time. Only recently strained honey was included at the request of the Omaha bank, and the intermountain honey producers through state cooperatives are now using Intermediate Credit. By utilizing a common sales agency, they hope eventually to market 200 cars an - nually. The loans to farmers' cooperative marketing associations are the only direct loans made by the Intermediate Credit Banks.

During 1927 the Omaha institution handled 4,753 rediscounts ag - gregating $13,660,259.13. This compares very favorably with 1926, the best "preceding year, when 3065 rediscounts were handled aggregating $11,375,406.71. Altogether the Omaha Bank has lent about $32,000,000.00 on live - stock, $18,000,000.00 of which has been renewals. These loans have all been made by livestock loan companies, or other agencies for the pur - pose of financing livestock — the feeding of cattle or sheep — financing of breeding herds — dairy cows or range cattle. Nearly a hundred agencies have been so served. The largest amount outstanding for these purposes is approximately $5,500,000.00 which amount we have loaned at present. This is in spite of the fact that the number of agencies ! now rediscounting is much smaller than a few years ago when both banks and agriculture were distressed. ■ - ' ■ ' Direct loans to co-operative marketing associations dealing in wool, wheat and alfalfa seed, during 1927 were $931,574.16.

The liquidity of the rediscounts or chattel mortgage secured notes handled by the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank of Omaha is illus - trated by the fact that during 1927 cash payments by farmer and stockmen borrowers from natural liquidation or the selling of livestock completely finished and ready for market, amounted to $4,610,998.93. ■*■■■■ In the face of this heavy natural liquidation the total loans today outstanding exceed those at the close of 1926 by one and one quarter million dollars.

The Life-Blood of Agriculture is ample credit at a reasonable rate of interest and for a period of time that will enable the farmer to properly equip his farm and breed, raise, and market his livestock and crops. Grains need to be bred as well as livestock.

SHOULD WE DIVERSIFY? H. D. LUTE, Paxton . • Note: This address was given at the Crop Growers' program at the Agriculture meetings at Sidney, December 7-8-9, 1927. It is of such general interest that it is given here. There can be but one answer to this question if we are looking forward to a permanent and prosperous agriculture and to the building of real homes on the land. It is not for me to say where, when, or how to diversify. Every, farm is a problem in itself. Every farmer is a law unto himself in this matter. There are various types of farms. There are a variety of, conditions. And then there are farmers and fanners. There is no set plan for diversification that will fit all needs or conditions. Each farmer must study his farm, his environment, his ability and to some extent his inclinations. Soil Mining A one-crop system without diversification is but soil mining and leads to suitcase farming. Years ago many of the farmers in the wheat growing section of eastern Oregon stayed on the land long encuph 10 harvest and sepd the crop and spent the rest of the time ■ baskinc; in the sunshine of southern California. Many farmers in western Nebraska in years gone by were inclined to grow only wheat and live in town the rest of the time.

            <seg id="p210">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE . An Ever Increasing Problem Conservation of soil fertility is an ever increasing problem. This means a variety of crops must be grown so that certain particular elements shall not be unduly depleted. It means also the growing of legumes of the kind adapted to the conditions and of the kind best suited to fit into the general plan for that particular farm. It means keeping live stock, either dairying, growing stock on the place or feed - ing out. W. F. Taylor, in a little publication called "The Furrow" (no doubt most of you get it) says, "The farmer who tries to farm without live stock has a business on his' hands that is entirely out of balance. He is without barnyard manure which furnishes plant food and and im - proves the physical condition of his soils." . I can well remember when we had cattle and did but very little farming and it was a chore to get the manure disposed of and we had a pile as big as a barn back of the corrals. Now we feel that we must keep stock in order to have the manure for the crops, especially the sugar beet crop. Then, too, we feel that live stock furnishes the best market for feed grains and roughage and practically none of this is sold off the farm. In fact our cash crops are beets and live stock. Farm Is a Home The farm is more than a work shop. It is A home. Agriculture is move than a mere job. It is a life. The farmers are builders and their reward lies in the knowledge of a. task well done and a life well spent. But to leave a farm and a home for posterity there must have been a variety of field crops, including legumes. There must have been live stock to build the soil. There must have been poultry for pin money. There must have been trees and shrubs and (lowers for the artistic influence and benediction. There must have been comfortable buildings for protection and comfort. There must have been children to furnish the incentive for building a home out in God's open space. So I repeat: There can be but one answer to the question if we are looking forward to a permanent and prosperous agriculture and to the building of a real home on the land. </seg>

            <seg id="p212">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Summer Fallow vs Corn and Wheat Summer fallowing versus a corn and winter wheat combination brought out a warm discussion and a wide variation in opinions. The diversified fanning men advocated corn and reported yields of wheat in corn land that substantiated their ideas. The stalks hold the snow. The value of the corn more than balances what extra wheat is grown on fallow, there is less risk in farming, labor is better distributed and livestock may be kept, were the main arguments brought out by the com advocates. On the other hand those in favor of wheat rotated with fallow argued that neither the corn or the wheat amounted to much when grown in rotation; there is too much labor in husking the short low down corn, corn fields are often too dry to start wheat properly in the fall; and that it is impossible and impractical to handle as large an acreage of corn as of wheat which is necessary in a corn wheat rota - tion. The advocates of fallow argued against stubbling in wheat, at least on any large scale, and advocated the use of what corn land there may be for growing spring grain such as oats or better yet barley. After all perhaps each man must weigh these arguments and make his own decision. "How shall we handle our wheat straw and stubble?" was another question that stirred up several arguments. It seemed to be the quite general concensus of opinion that so far as immediate results are con - cerned the highest yields of wheat are being grown on fields where the straw is burned off. Just what this practice will lead to if continued was questioned by some who pointed out that such practices must even - tually result in soil depletion and that straw should be turned under. To off-set this argument farmers who had plowed under straw reported that it rotted very slowly, if at all, for several seasons and tended to dry out the soil doing, on the whole, more harm than good. The writer pointed out the reasons Why straw applied to land may reduce crup yields. It was shown that numerous experiments have proven, probably without doubt, that straw applied to land may have a depressing affect on grain crops that follow. This is because soil bacteria work on the straw combining the cellulose ■which it con - tains in large amounts, with the nitrates of the soil. Nitrogen or nitrates, which is the form in which plants use nitrogen, is the element most likely to be deficient in Nebraska soils. The lack of available soil nitrates reduces the yield of grain crops. For this reason straw spread on wheat fields or worked into the soil often reduces the yield of wheat. It was further reported by the chaiman that at the Mitchell station two plats have been growing spring wheat each season for many years. . ;. J </seg>
            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The straw) on one plat has been removed each year while the straw on the other has been returned to the land each season. The yields over a 14 year period are 17.2 bushels for the straw removed plat and 16.8 bushels where the straw has been put back on. the land. A study of the yields during the past five years during which time the accumula - tive results xjf the treatments should become apparent show a yield ' - of 11.4 bushels where the straw was removed as compared to 10 3 bushels where left on the land. j The-results of some studies by Professor J. C. Bussel of the Ne - braska Agricultural College on the losses. of organic matter and nitrogen in western Nebraska soils were reported. In brief these studies show a loss of organic matter and nitrogen at practically the same rate as for eastern Nebraska. On the whole the loss approxi - mates nearly a per cent a year, that is, fields that have been farmed under the! summer fallow plan for 15 years have lost from 12 to 15 per cent of their organic matter. Fields farmed for 40 years have lost J?uf W Ut 2 ° Per Cent ° f their orffanic matter and "itrogen. Table. XIV gives some representative figures on this.

Two years of sweet clover seeded on well prepared land should make satisfactory stands and a growth sufficient to restore fertility to a high standard. . The question box ended, with a discussion of combines. Most farmers in attendance felt that the combine was a machine that had come to stay but that it brought with it a number of problems. Its chief advantage is its economy and saving of labor. Figures given indicate that with combines one can cut, thresh and put wheat into trucks at about the cost of binding and shocking. The handling of wet grain during seasons such as the 1927 one is a great problem. Some </seg>
            <seg id="p214">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE farmers start to combine before the grain is ripe enough. Others attempt to handle too many acres per machine. Some farmers reported that the binder used to start the season is a safety measure well worth while. THE WHEAT SMUT SPECIAL D. L. GROSS During the month of August 1927 the Nebraska Crop Growers co - operated with the Burlington Railroad, the Omaha Grain Exchange, and the Colleges of Agriculture of Nebraska, of Colorado and Kansas, in conducting the "Wheat SmUt Special" train. An indication of the im - portance of this work is ascertained by the report of the Omaha grain Exchange which shows that in 1926, 38 per cent of the wheat reach - ing that market was graded smutty. Most of this smutty wheat came from the western half of the state, and it was for this reason that it was through this part of the state that the train was run. The schedule of stops was as follows: August 15th Crawford, Nebr. August 22nd Oxford, Nebr. Hemingford, Nebr. Cambridge, Nebra. Alliance, Nebr. McCook, Nebr.

These consisted of four cars, the first showing the life history of smut, how it attacks the wheat plant, an idea as to the extent of the losses from this disease, and means of control. The second car was a flat car on which the demonstration in seed treatment was held, and where various machines for treating the seed were! on exhibit. The third car told how new varieties of grain are developed, and how these varieties are passed on to the Nebraska Crop Growers Association to be grown by its members under rules whirl) allowed the increase to be sold certified seed. The fourth and las* car, prepared by the Omaha Grain Exchange, showed how tht prdin is handled when it reaches the terminal market. It brought out thn importance of producing seed free from mixtures and smut A stand was maintained " in this car where bulletins from the Agricul - tural College were. available to. the visitors. I • Attendance at Train . Representatives of the Colleges of Agriculture, the Crop Growers Asfwirition, the Omaha' Grain Exchange, and the Burlington were stained in the different exhibit cars and explained the exhibits to the vK'ors as they passed' through. A' total of 25,409 visitors passer through the train. Cards filled out by the visitors indicated that an per cent treated their wheat in the fall of 1926, while 82 per cent ivcH ' 'reat their wheat in the fall of 1927. "'he train was put on exhibit at the State Pair, and was visited by 49 000 people. ' Much publicity was given this train before and while it was on the roar! It is felt that.it did much good towards reducing the smut losses, in acquainting the people with the best varieties of small grain which nxj being certified by the Association and in improving the general quality of grain which reaches |the terminal markets. The success of this train would not have been possible, had it not been for the hearty cooperation of the local people at each stop. At each town where the train was stopped a local committee was in charge. The time and effort expended by these committees was a splendid contribution to the cause of better fanning. Points Stressed By Train Throe points were especially stressed at the various stops. These hiui o &lt;!o with the importance of the proper use of the copper car - hnw •&lt;• -rtjatment, the effect of temporature and seedbed conditions on the'. ount of smut, and- the desirability of using pure seed of the t&lt;&gt; apoty, free from smut and mixtures. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">REPORT OF XEBHASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Owing to the fact that the copper carbonate method of seed treat - ment is new, many growers not understanding the principles involved, have not used the method properly and consequently have had poor control of the smut. The result of these experiences was to cause many farmers to condemn the treatment as ineffective. Careful work at many experiment stations and on farms has shown beyond a doubt that the treatment will control the smut if properly used. Investigations as to why certain farmers failed to. get good results with the treat - ment, have shown that in most cases . improper methods of applying the powder were used. The copper carbonate method is not completely ef - fective unless all the seed is thoroughly coated with the ponder. This cannot be done by using the scoop shovel to mix the powder with the wheat, nor can it be done by running the seed and the powder through an elevator or an anger conveyer. The only really effective method is to use a good commercial machine (some of these are useless), or to make a home made mixer from a barrel, box, or cement mixer. The barrel type of mixer shown in the illustration has proven very satis - factory. Even with this type of machine a poor job of treating can be done, however, unless the operator follows directions. The most com - mon mistake made is to put too much wheat in the barrel at a time. The more wheat put in the barrel the less room there is for proper I . — .■■.] FiK. 27_An effective way to treat seed wheat with copper; carbonate dust Is In a home-made barrel such as this, which can be easi y and cheaply built. </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION mixing 1 , the more turns it requires for a thorough job of coating the seed, and the harder it is to turn. For a fifty gallon barrel not more than a bushel of wheat at each operation is recommended, and a half bushel works move satisfactorily. A load of wheat can be treated as rapidly if hot more so, by using a half bushel as can be done by using a bushel. At the same time chances' for obtaining a thorough coating of the seed with the powder are better. By treating one-half bushel at each operation, two men working together can treat 30 to 35 bushels of wheat in an hour. The . same can be done when a thirty gallon barrel is used, and the turning is easier. A feature of the copper carbonate method of treatment which has caused certain ones to dislike it, is the fact that the inhaling of much of the copper carbonate dust often causes illness. This of course should be guarded against. The treatment should be done in the open where the breeze will carry the powder away, and where the operators can avoid breathing too much of the powder. Wheat may be treated with copper carbonate at any time 'and stored until sown. Copper carbonate treated seed is poisonous and should not be feed to livestock or. sold on the market. If chickens or animals of any kind pick up a little that may be scattered in the treat - ing process there is no particular danger of injury. . ! . Weather and Smut The second point stressed was the effect of weather on the amount of smut in wheat. A few growers seem to be of the opinion that weather causes smut and that no amount or kind of seed treatment will control the smut if weather conditions are favorable for its develop - ment. There is of course no question but what weather and soil con - ditions do have considerable effect on the amount of smut in any given year. To say however that "weather causes, smut is of course untrue. Smut can not develop regardless of weather and soil conditions if the smut .spores or "seeds" are not present to start with. It would be as logical to say the weather causes corn. We' know that the proper weather conditions are necessary for the production of a good corn crop, but we know also that even with the best of conditions we can not grow a [crop of corn unless we plant the seed. So it is with smut. The fine black dust that is found within the smut balls is composed of millions of tiny smut spores. These have the power to germinate the ' same as any ordinary seed. If the spores are on the seed when it is planted, they germinate and ; send a tube inside of the young wheat sprout. Once inside of the wheat plant the smut continues to grow there without apparently affecting the growth of the wheat. When the </seg>

The damage if any" is all done lust as the wheat is germinating and coming above the grouid. It may thus bo understood why, if soed is treated, and the spores &gt;n the seed killed, that no smut can possibly develop. The copper carbonate treat - ment nrotects the seed after it is planted from any smut scores which might be in the soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p219">■•■■■■■ NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Obviously then, it is only the weather and soil conditions ui&gt; ynuu. - ing or germination time that have any influence on the amount of smut in the succeeding crop. In the smut car a drawing, as shown in figure 28, was displayed. This shows that smut germinates most rapidly at the temperatures between 48 degrees and 68 degree. Consequently if the soil is at this temperature at seeding time, and untreated smutty seed is sown, a heavy smut loss can be expected. It is for this reason that late sown wheat is more apt to be smutty. Early sown wheat usually' encounters a soil with a temperature at 70 degree or above. Even smutty untreated seed sown on soil of this temperature and : containing sufficient moisture to promote rapid germination, may come through with very little smut infection. In other words, conditions which promote rapid germination of the seed tend to reduce smut losdes, and the opposite conditions tends to magnify the losses. Since the soil conditions cannot be controlled entirely ' the safest practice is to treat the seed, and then, regardless of conditions, the smut will be controlled. .. '.

This condition can be improved by growing only the best varieties, by keeping out mixtures, by careful harvesting methods, and by seed treatment to control smut. Nebraska can produce a high quality, uniform, grade of wheat, that will sell for a premium on the market if these things are watched. SEED IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES OF THE NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS ASSOCIATION P. H. STEWART, Secretary The most outstanding activity of the Association along crop im - provement lines is the seed certification work. This has b'ejen carried on by the Association for a number of years and is now on a sub - stantial basis. This work has meant much to the state of Nebraska as it has furnished a supply of good dependable seed of standard recom - mended varieties. "Why certify seed 7 ", may be asked by some whu are not familiar with this activity. Why should the Crop Growers Associate in Certify seed anyway? There are several reasons. The Nebraska Agricultural College through its Experiment Station spends considerable time, effort and money in developing new and in testing old strains and varieties of crops for the people of Nebraska. When a very promising sort is dis - covered at the stations it is then tried out over the state in cooperative trials on farms under the supervision of County Agricultural Agents. When finally it is felt that the new variety is worthy of distribution it is put out by the Experiment Station to a number of good farmers who for the most part are members of the Crop Growers Association. Un - less such seed stock is traced, inspected and listed for sale, it soon be - comes lost and mixed, and its further distribution is at an end. How - ever, when certified by the Association, listed on the official Association seed list and given publicity through the press its spread is greatly ir creased to the benefit of the entire state. As will be noticed in the rules for the Seed Certification work a sales tax of 2 per cent of the selling price of certified seed sold for seed purposes is now paid by the growers for the promotion and carry - ing on the seed certification work. This together with the inspection fees make the work self supporting and is therefore not an expense to tax payers althn they profit on the whole from it. The following rules governed the Seril Certification work in 1927 and in 1928. 1. Requirements for Certification. Applicants for certification must be members of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association. The membership' fee is $1.00 which </seg>
            <seg id="p221">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION entitles one to life membership, a copy of the printed annual report of the Association, and other membership privileges. 2. Crops eligible for Certification. Fields of Kanred, Nebraska 60 winter wheat, Marquis spring wheat', Nebraska 21 oats, Burt 293 oats, Kanota (Fulghum) oats, Trebi,' Minnesota 184, Velvet and Comfort barley, Rosen rye, and ■ such other crops and strains as may seem desirable, will be ■ , eligible for certification. 3. Source of seed, etc. . Fields to be eligible for certification must have been sown co seed which came from the Nebraska Agricultural College or other similar satisfactory sources or which was certified the previous year. Because of the danger of mixing through volunteer grains, ..certified fields of fsill wheat and rye can not be grown on land which the previous season was in other varieties or uncertified seed of these crops. Rosen rye fields must 'be at least one-fourth mile from other rye fields due to the danger of cross pollination. Since other small grains do not cross, different varieties may be grown side by. side, and if cut separately and carefully handled they will be eligible for certification. 4. Disqualifications of fields. ■ ' I " ■ • ■ When fields are unsatisfactory as to volunteer crops, identity of variety, mixing in cutting, purity, mixture of other grains, smut or noxious weeds such as the small-flowered morning' glory, the association retains full right to refuse certification.- Final deci - sions on these matters will rest with a Seed Certification Com - mittee of 5 appointed by the President of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association. 5. Nature of Inspections of field. The field inspection will be made so far as possible just before harvest. The purpose of this inspection is to check up on purity, disease, mixtures, noxious weeds, and to get acquainted with the grower, at which time methods for handling, cleaning, and selling the seed may be discussed. 6. Threshed sample Inspection. lEa'ch grower, before the seed is finally certified, must submit a; representative threshed sample similar in quality and condition to what will be supplied to customers. This sample will be passed on by the Certification Committee and if satisfactory as to quality, purity, and germination, will be passed for final certification. A </seg>
            <seg id="p222">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sample of seed submitted by the grower will be put into the hands of the State Seed Analyst who will report on the germina - tion and purity. This information in addition to that supplied by the field inspection report will be used by the Certification Com - mittee as a basis for certification. All seed sold by growers must be tapped as required by the Nebraska State Seed Law. 7. Fees for inspection. An inspection fee of $3.00 per individual will be charged r&amp; (ranl)ess of the number of fields and varieties provided they are all on one farm. Checks for this amount must accompany the applications. In case of hail storms, drought, or other unfavorable crop conditions, or in case the field can nut qualify, the application may be withdrawn and the fee returned providing the inspector has not left the secretary's office for that county. In addition to this certification fee a sales tax of 2 per cent of the total value of the certified seed sold for seeding purposes is levied by the as - sociation. The grower should accompany such a fee with a list of the parties to whom he sold seed. The funds raised by the sales tax will be used for the purpose of advertising the seed, carrying on certification work and for the general promotion of the certi - fied seed work. 8. Application. All applications should be in by June 1 and none will be ac - c&lt;i&gt;t&lt;'l after June 1"). All applications must be on official applica - liun lil-inks which will be supplied by the association.

T]i i"i ll&lt;m inn- description is for the varieties that were certified in 1027. Nebraska HO Winter Wheat is an improved selection from common Turkey Hod winter wheat, which has continuously outyielded ordinary Turkey lied winter wheat in trials covering a number of years. In general appearance it is similar to ordinary Turkey Red. This variety is very popular wherever trrown in the state, being particularly- good in winter hardiness, strenuth of straw, and quality. 'Kanred Winter Wheat is also superior to Turkey Red in yield. There seems to be an appreciable difference in the milling and baking qualities \&gt;f Kanred, Nebraska 60, and Turkey Red wheat. Results at Nebraska Experiment Stations and on Nebraska farms show Nebraska fin and Kanred to be high-yielding, satisfactory varieties for Nebraska. </seg>

Kanred wheat is more resistant to some forms of Black Stem Rust. Rosen; Rye, a Michigan product, has been grown over the state for several seasons with excellent results. It has a heavier straw, larger head, and larger kernel than common rye and has given increased yields of 2 to 3 bushels. Nebraska 21 Oats is a white selection of the ordinary yellow Kher - son variety. At the Nebraska Experiment Station, in cooperative tests, and on farms out in the state, they have been outyielding ordinary Kherson oats from five to ten per cent. The color makes this variety especially i attractive. They are very similar to the ordinary Kherson in length ! and strength of straw, and earliness. They were first dis - tributed several years ago and are now being grown widely over the state. Farmers waiuting barley-free Mats are referred to the men listed in this seed list. : .1 Burt J293 Oats was distributed first in 1927 after several years of careful testing. They have been .outstanding in yield in cooperative tests and ;in Experiment Station trials they have shown up exceptionally well. The kernel color varies from white to brownish, but the prevail - ing color | is light.- They ripen even earlier than the Nebraska 21 oats. This variety should prove very popular in all parts of Nebraska. •Kanota Oats (Fulghum) are very popular in Kansas where they out-yield jail other varieties. At Lincoln they have not yielded quite so well as the Nebraska 21 and Burt 293 varieties. They appear to be best adapted along the southern border of Nebraska and it is suggested that farmers of that part of the state give them a trial. In earliness, and length of straw they are similar to Nebraska 21. The grain is somewhat shorter and thicker and of a grayish brown color. Comfort Barley has proven very promising in Nebraska Experi - ment Station' and cooperative tests. This variety was developed by crossing I at the Minnesota station. It is bearded, but the beards are smooth, that is they do not have the rough edges which makes ordinary barley so disagreeable to handle. This barley straw should make valua - ble feed.) The Comfort barley is early and has a stiff straw of medium height, j This variety seems to be the most promising of the smooth bearded sorts for Nebraska as a whole^ Velvet Barley like the Comfort is a Minnesota cross. It is slightly later and taller than the Comfort which would seem to make it best ad - apted to northeastern Nebraska or at least the northern half of the state. In Minnsota it is reported as out yielding the Comfort variety. The beards are even smoother than the Comfort variety.

Imported and southern seed has been commonly sold in this state where it has lacked hardiness to survive our winter weather. It was in a effort to foster alfalfa seed production in Nebraska and to attempt to develop a j supply of dependable seed that the Nebraska Crop Growers- Association worked out plans for alfalfa seed certification. This service was offered growers in 1927 for the first time but unfavorable weather prevented the twenty or more men who applied for certifica - tion from growing a seed crop. The rules for approval and certifica - tion have been worked out by the Association as follows: Rules for Alfalfa Seed Certification 1. Membership.— Applications for certification must be members of the Nebraska Crop Grosvers Association. The membership fee is $1.00 which entitles one to life membership, a copy of the printed annual re - port of the asociation and other membership privileges. Applications for. alfalfa seed certification should be in by July 15 and will not be accepted after August 10. ■ 2. Varieties.— The following kinds of alfalfa seed will be eligible for approval and for certification providing they comply with conditions as stated.) </seg>
            <seg id="p226">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR APPROVAL 1. Nebraska Hardy Alfalfa.— Seed from fields of alfalfa which are at least 8 years old and still a reasonably good stand will be eligible for approval. These fields may be of any variety such as common or Turkestan or they may be Grimm for which certificates from recognized associations are not available. Since this seed will be of an unknown or undeter- • mined variety, it can not be certified as to variety but will be called approved seed. Seed from fields seeded to approved seed or from fields tracing directly to registered approved fields although they may themselves not yet be 8 years old will be eligibte for approval. FOR CERTIFICATION 2. Grimm and Cossack. — Seed from fields for which satis - factory proof can be submitted proving the field to have been seeded to certified Grimm or Cossack seed from a reliable source, will be eligible for certification. Fields of these vari - eties must in addition show typical variegated flowers when field inspected. Only seed from registered fields as certified to by recognized state seed associations will be considered as being from a reliable source. C. Hardistan Alfalfa. — There are in Dawson County a few fields of hardy, alfalfa which during a considerable period of time have proven very hardy and in Experiment Station tests have yielded well. Since definite proof is lacMng as to what variety these fields are, the name of Hardistan has been given to this alfalfa. Seed eligible for certification must trace directly to the original hardy Arnold Bros, field at Cozad or to certified seed of this strain. 3. Disqualifications.— The full right to reject or accept fields of alfalfa for the certification of the seed crop rests entirely with the certification board of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association who will base their judgement on the proof offered as to the origin of the seed sown on the field and the reports of the inspector as to plant char - acteristics. Alfalfa fields having more than a slight trace of sweet clover will be disqualified. The presence of dodder, Canada thistle, or small flowered morning glory automatically disqualifies the field. Cer - tification services will be refused any grower who fails to comply with ' the rules as to reports, cleaning, sealing, and tagging the seed or who . in any other way jeopardizes the standing of certified seed and the confidence of the public therein. </seg>

This is to prevent danger . of mixing. 4. Inspections.— Growers interested in having alfalfa yields regis - tered and seed, approved or certified must submit an application blank • giving the requested information regarding the field. Once fields are accepted they will be registered; with the Secretary of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association and given a definite number. .. A field inspection will be made when the field is in full bloom to check up weeds, sweet clover, and variegated blossoms if the field is Grimm or Cossack.' In November, December or January a second inspection or "threshed seed inspection" will be made at which time the alfalfa seed must be cleaned and sacked in association sacks. After cleaning the growers must submit sample for purity and germination tests. When the seed meets the requirements for quality and germination and purity the inspector will. then seal the sacks and leave official tags ■ and sales cards with the grower. 5. Fees.— A certification fee of ?3.00 must accompany the applica - tion blankj This will be returned if the application is refused on the basis of the information supplied on the application blank. If a field inspection is made the fees will be retained by the association. A sales tax on certified seed sold by growers will be levied this to be paid following the sale of the seed. A sales tax fee of 5 per . </seg>
            <seg id="p228">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cent of the sale value of Hardistan and Nebraska Hardy alfalfa, Grimm and Cossack alfalfa will be charged. 6. Use of Fees. — It is the plan to make the small grain and alfalfa seed certification self-supporting and to put it on its own expense as soon as possible. To begin with the Nebraska Agricultural College and Nebraska Crop Growers Association and County Farm Bureau will foster the work. The sales tax funds will be put in a fund to pay the expenses of inspections, advertising, and general promotion. Even - tually when considerable volume is built up the sales tax percentage can be much reduced. </seg>

J. PETERS, St. Michael SECRETARY L. K. CROWE, Lincoln PROP. H. P. DAVIS: This year in the absence of our President, Mr. E. J. Peters, I am assuming the gavel. I Each year at the annual meeting of the Nebraska State Dairy - men's Association, we call on the Secretary for a report. However, our program is a bit crowded and inasmuch as his report will be published in the proceedings of the Association and will be available for all of those who are members, we will dispense with the reading of that report at this time. Any organization that does business, must have committees and any organization that perpetuates itself must of necessity elect officers. In order that our time may not be delayed, I will appoint a nominat - ing committee which later on will report, when we may elect our officers. As members of that nominating committee, I would like M. L. Flack, Chairman; Mike Hepperly; and Vernon Andrews. For resolu - tions I would like to appoint C. K. Morse, Chairman; R. W. McGinnis; and A. L. Haecker. For the auditing committee, which is rather a ) perfunctory job, inasmuch as the treasurer handles no funds, I will ap - point A. L. Haecker and M. N. Lawritson. These committees will re - port later. Dairymen are dependent upon good cows for carrying on a pro - fitable dairy business and good cows do not just happen, there is a reason for it. And to explain a little bit the reason for good cows and the relationship of the purebred, I have the great pleasure and honor </seg>
            <seg id="p269">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION today, to present the secretary of one of our great breed associations, Mr. Karl Musser, a graduate of Kansas. He has been connected with various dairy organizations from one end of the country to the other from Washington to Connecticut, and is now Secretary of the American Guernsey Cattle Club, Peterboro, New Hampshire. I take great pleasure in presenting Mr. Karl Musser. MR. MUSSER: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: ' May I say in starting that , it is really; a pleasure to come to Ne - braska on my maiden speech trip, soto speak. The only other time ■ that I have been in Nebraska was on a sight-seeing trip from your neighbor on the south, and that was seventeen years ago. My experience in dairying 4 Kansas I imagine is quite typical of that which your people have had and that starts.back in the days when . our parents or our grandparents ran beef cattle, on the plains. My grandfather drove them from Abilene, Texas to Abilene, Kansas. And with a herd of 300, we always had 25 to 60 cows milking. In those • days when a cow dropped off in production, she was turned out with the feeders, and we brought in 1 another cow ttat had freshened and milked her until she declined." Those times have changed and we have now through those states, in this section and in the United States, greater interest than ever before in better dairy cattle. Better dairy cattle, as your chairman has stated, are a necessity to successful and profitable dairying, the background of good production. An economically sound breeding pro - gram or the dairy herd is of course the purebred | regardless of the breed Purebred cattle have bee'n in existence for many years. They were founded of course by many types of people. The Jersey and Guernsey were founded through the interest of isolated students of religion, in having for their' own table the type of product they wanted . If you will study the history of any breed of dairy cattle, you will find back of it has been a great desire of those founding it to produce cattle specialized in the production of milk This has been going on for ages, so to speak, and it goes without say - ing that if Nebraska is going to have more efficient cattle, then they should look to the pure bred to do it for them. The pure bred will 1 carry on in such a way that you wil^have every assurance of success - ful grade cattle. Use pure bred sires from dams that have a potency for moving forward from that point at which your herd pro - duces at the present time. I can say that ten years from today as I return to speak to a group sucH as this, that the audience will be made up of a much larger percentage of pure bred dairymen. I feel that Nebraska in dairying is in the transitional stage. I believe in the heart of every good dairyman who does not have pure bred cattle, ■■'■': ■ . ■ . ■ . : </seg>
            <seg id="p270">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE there is a desire to have a pure bred herd. I am, therefore going to devote considerable of my time to the difference in the management of the type of dairying that you must recognize if you change from a good grade herd to a pure bred herd. I will have something to say also about the responsibility of pure bred breeders to be found in Nebraska. Nebraska is one of the high ranking states in the interest of pure bred cattle. Never before in the history of three of the breeds that I am acquainted with, have there been so many inquiries regarding pure bred cattle from this state. I want to lay down one or two statements upon which I am going to base my talk. The first one is this, I can see but two purposes for a pure bred cow. One is to reproduce herself, and the other is to furnish bull calves and through them raise the average production of dairy cattle in America. In America today, we have but three per cent of the dairy cattle that are pure bred. Yet at the same time, the figures by Dr. Larson of the United States Department of Agricul - ture, Dairy Bureau, shows that there has been in the past ten or twelve years a great increase in the average production of dairy cattle in the United States. He attributes it to the Pure Bred Sire . Campaign that has now been in force for seven or eight years. Through that procedure, we will travel more rapidly than through any other. My conception of pure bred cows is their contribution to the improvement of their own kind, and more especially in sons that are going to make dairying more profitable. Without this, I doubt if any breed can long sustain itself as a leader. Those of you who have excellent grade herds, and there are many in Nebraska I believe have a great desire to see what they can do with pure breds. I want to tell you that the operation of a grade herd is exactly to me as the keeping of a "private dairy." The happenings are quite largely your own business. There was a time and there are places now where the matter of tubercular testing is a matter for your own initiative. If you have grade cattle, it is con - sidered a matter of your own business. Everything that happens in a grade herd is undt r your control. It is something that your neighbor or even the man purchasing your product has little to say about; When you go into pure breds you must write more down than you ever did before and it is a volume for the "public libraries." You are duty bound to record every detail effecting your herd. When you start breeding pure bred live stock, you become a public benefactor, so to speak and your herd is no longer your own business. For instance, take the individuality of a grade herd — I have in mind the grade herds that y used to visit when I was a cow tester, herd improvement I un - derstand you call it now. The best herd that it has ever been my pleasure to work with, led its association for seven consecutive years, </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION because of the wisdom of the breeder in the selection of sires for production. He paid no attention to teats, and udders were terrible. All the way from teats that you could hardly reach around to teats that you could hardly milk. Yet that man made money and he has . . today one of. the finest herds in Connecticut, and conducts his herd in the same way today. He slaughters the cattle when they play out. The individuality, he cares nothing about, and that is largely true, though not quite so true in sections of Wisconsin where many hundreds of carloads of grade cattle are shipped each year. When you have a pure bred herd, you immediately have an added difficulty an added problem of carrying on that herd, because the pure bred business today requires more now than any time in the past in developing its individuality and any other characteristics you may desire. If you have a pure bred herd, and have not had to make a tuber - cular test, you. are duty bound to test. There are often arguments that there is more tuberculosis found in pure bred herds than in grade herdB. The fact of the matter is easily shown by the data on file in Washington which shows that there is a larger proportion of pure bred herds tested for tuberculosis than there are grade herds. You cannot expect to market pure breds unless you can give a clean bill of health for tuberculosis. That goes without saying. Contagious abortion is prevalent more or less all over the United States and England, and all other countries, except semi - isolated regions. The pure bred industry today faces a demand on the part of people founding herds that they be sold animals free from contagious abortion. There are a number of states that require similar tests for contagious abortion that they do for tuberculosis. And if some purchasers were to come to Nebraska you would have to furnish them blood tests showing that your herd has no contagious abortion. Udder trouble: I am a firm believer that the tendency toward udder - trouble is an inherited characteristic and I have been convinced of that because of seeing some families within the several breeds of cattle that have a tendency to have light quarters before they are old cows. The clientele that call on you today in pure bred herds are not in - quiring into that as closely as they will ten years from now, but never - theless, it is something that you must bear in mind. If you buy from a herd that has a high tendency toward udder failure, you will find that they will carry that tendency into your herd. If you have a grade herd and you have a number of scouring calves about the place, it does not make so much difference, but if you have a pure bred herd and there are white scours, you will have a hard time to sell foundation cattle, because the clientele who have studied the matter believe that there is a tendency on the part of </seg>
            <seg id="p272">KKPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE herds that have white scours to pass on a tendency toward abortion, if not contagious abortion, weakness in breeding. With a grade herd, the matter of production plane lies largely in your own hands. If you are satisfied with 250 pounds of butter fat, and you find that you can make a profit, that is your business. If you should have a pure bred herd that will not produce more than that, then your added investment is a total loss, and I am sorry to state that there are too many pure bred herds founded today on cull cattle because of the great demand for pure bred cattle. And I speak of this in this case because we need more people in Nebraska interestd in pure bred cattle and 1 want you to consider this when you found a herd. Be - cause a man has one cow in his herd that has broken a world's record, is no reason that you will get the blood of this cow in youi foundation cattle. But if he had a herd of consistently good producers \ - from the two-year olds to the old cows, you can make a selection from that herd with a greater degree of certainty that you are going to have a profitable dairy herd, and the pure bred herd that is founded on anything else than making a profit on production is a detriment rather than a boom to the dairy industry. When you have grade cattle you may keep private records for your own use, and those private records will be accepted on exactly the same basis that you can borrow money on your word. Private records are worth just exactly what a man's words is and should a stranger come to that herd, he knows you only as he comes, and he banks little on your private record. If you go into breeding pure bred dairy cattle you must add to your prog-ram a system of keeping a more complete record than the private records. We are rapidly reaching the stage in pure bred cattle when America will have herd testing. Then a man who wishes foundation animals will be able to go and select them from herds of the pro - duction plane he seeks. It is an effective measure of protection for pure bred cattle in America, and it is only a few years until all breed associations will have herd test records. Advanced Register work is today the record that is recognized more in a commercial way than any other because of the circumstances under which the record is made and the positive identification of the cattle. There was a time when dairymen purchased bulls or foundation cattle and the only question they asked was "How much is it?" Eight years ago if a cow had a 600 pounds record, that was the only question the clientele wanted to know. That day is past and the man who buys will look for cattle intelligently. He wants to know the age for the record, he wants to know how many times a day the cattle are milked. And he also wants to know more about the handling, whether in summer time he had electric fans and that sort of thing. The man who goes on a general principle of testing for Advanced Register records, is in my opinion aside from the question. Because of the failure of one cow after . ' </seg>
            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION making a 600 pound record to come into your herd and make 600 pounds on daily milking under ordinary farm conditions is no reason why you should discount all register records made. The wise man looks into this situation and finds for himself a family of cows that have been consistently good producers, rather than a family that has produced one world's record. I believe it is good advice for those of you who contemplate the founding of a pure bred herd or those who will purchase pure bred sires to add to your grade herd that instead of buying- an animal by mail, add to that price whatever it may be, enough to travel and see the . herd from which he comes. It is of tremendous importance that you see the dam and the grand dam and all the family that he comes from. It is not sufficient that you have a ■ cow that has made a suc - cessful record and she has a. son that has transmitted the ability to produce large quantities of milk and fat. It means much to you, however, that if you find in a particular family the tendency to cease breeding after producing two or three calves, longevity of repro - duction is a characteristic that is inherited beyond the shadow of a doubt. May I then add another suggestion in founding a herd. Let it be this: Select your foundation cattle from a herd in which the majority of breeding cows live to the period of eight to twelve calves. That is a severe rule but is the best protection that you have in founding pure bred herds. He who has persistent stamina for long breeding life in his cattle is the man who will lead in the future. 1 have, in mind an. illustration, along this very line, of a herd in New York State that was founded twenty-eight years ago. This man pur - chased two cows. The family from one cow has an average during all these twenty-eight years of slightly over three calves breeding life of each female in that family. The other cow has an average of eight calves. I do not need to tell jyou which one of these cows filled the barn with her progeny. And the happy situation is also that the long lived cow has been one of faiij production, but the only world records were from the short lived families but the profitableness of that breeder's operations were made large, not by the spectacular records of the short lived family but by the constant reproduction and fair pro - duction of the long lived family. For those who •. contemplate establishing a pure bred herd, I have two things to say. The first thing I want you to study is the reproduction and the breeding of the herd. Do not pick an animal here and an animal there. Pick out the herd that is the kind of herd you would like to have and then buy if it is possible, even though it costs $50 to $100 more per head. You will find that at the close of twelve years, that you will be ahead. It takes eight to twelve yeara to find out whether or not you made a successful purchase. You </seg>
            <seg id="p274">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE must bear in mind that you will probably not be able to tell whethei you have purchased, rightly or not for eight or twelve years. That sounds rather discouraging but I doubt if anyone who has seen as many pure breds and as many pure bred herds, as I have seen will be able to dispute this statement. The foundation cattle that you as - semble for your pure bred herd will not tell their story in the majority of cases short of eight to twelve years. With grade herds, the matter of rearing young stock is your own business. If you want to breed them at fourteen months or eight months, that is your own business. But if you have a pure bred herd, you must breed them so that they will mature with their first calf. By maturing, I mean they will have average size represented and will have an opportunity to develop in udder and constitution and be a credit as a member of that herd. If bred too young, it is impossible for them to do this. In grade herds dehorning is a matter of choice. In pure bred herds the horns should be left for the benefit of the observing buyer of foundation stock. I mention this as one of the minor points of raising pure bred live stock. Many a breeder has paid dearly for the set of horns he took off his cow. You know as well as I do that the cow that brings the money today is the animal that has appear - ance, individuality and show ability and at the same time producing ability. And the removal of horns discounts the value of that animal considerably, in some cases. Breeders of pure bred live stock feel that the tendency toward refinement is indicated in the homs as much as any place else. The establishment that has pure bred cattle must take on a different appearance than those which have grade herds. There is no more important operation than that of keeping detailed breeding records and records of identification. It is not sufficient to say that your cattle grow up with you and that you handle them every day and that it is impossible for you to make a mistake. A man coming into your herd, a pure bred herd and finding records poorly kept, finding the breeding dates written on the barn wall and that sort of thing, im - mediately has fear in his heart because he might think that you may have made a mistake in the breeding dates, service dates, or even the identity of the calf. When two cows are turned out to pasture a man remembers the one as the larger arid if another one passes it in growth, he remembers the one that went out as the larger one and a mistake is thus made. The man who breeds pure bred cattle must guard himself on every side to escape criticism in identification. Grade herds can allow the sire to run with the herd. You can - not establish public confidence in a pure bred herd and let the bull rm» </seg>
            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION with" the herd. Before you found a pure bred herd, build a bull barn or a bull pen. Never make the mistake of allowing the bull to graze with the herd. I would not think of purchasing a foundation herd from a farm where the sires are! allowed to graze with the cattle. When "you have a pure bred herd, the variation in the value of the members of the herd is much more than it is in a grade herd. The purchaser going into a grade herd can offer $100 to $175 for his "pick" of any animal in that herd. When he goes into a pure bred herd, he might do the same, but if the breeder of that herd knows his values, it will not be so. I want to give you just one illustration and that is this. In the herd of a Milwaukee millionaire a man for the past seven years has been buying the animals at $176 apiece and the lowest record that any animals has made from that herd has been 453 pounds of fat and up to 673 pounds of fat as two year olds. They have all been sold for thejsame price. The fact of the matter is that the man does not know the value of his cattle and if you intend to go into the pure bred cattle industry you must read and study • and know when you have a $1000 or $100 animal. That is a very im - portant part' in financial success. Come back now to the matter of grade herds, or "Why The Pure BredT" and some of the propaganda that has been put out to prove that man is foolish to breed pure bred cattle, when he can do so much better with grades. They are generally discussed on the basis of two cows; a good grade and a poor pure bred. There are three classes of cattle kept in pure bred herds that are not kept in grade herdB, I refer first to the old cow that lost her udder but breeds won - derful stuff. She would not be kept in a grade herd because she does not produce milk enough to pay for her board but she reproduces the kind of animals wanted and therefore is a financial benefit Old cows that just because of declining years have dropped \&gt;ut of pfbfit from a milk production standpoint are kept because of their calves. Second: One of the things wise breeders of pure breds will do is to keep cows that are unprofitable at the pail because of age, but are good breeders. Third: In pure bred herds will be found animals that produce wonder - fully profitable progeny but they themselves as. producers of milk, are not profitable. The wisdom of this is riot within the province of my talk today. ■ -' ■ ' - ■ ■ The pure bred industry has changed just as much as has the matter of milking grade cows even within our lifetime. There was a time when you would see pure bred sales from 50 to 100 animals, everyone of them a cull but on the block brought a high price for no other reason than because they were bred to John Smith's $10,000 bull: You have all seen it, but that day is past and I want Nebraska </seg>

Those who are breeding pure bred cattle must not submit to the temptation to sell great breeding animals. If you were making shoes in a factory, just because you had a machine that was making 25 to 45 more pairs in a day than any other machine, you would not sell it Think in the same terms of pure bred herds and grade herds. Don't sell your machine. Keep those old breeding matrons that produce great cows and they will bring to you assurance of longer periods of profits. PROF. DAVIS: I am sure that all of the points that Mr. Musser has brought are appreciated and if we could just remember these, 1 think we could appreciate how valuable and necessary it is to take these precautions that he has mentioned. The points he has previewed brought back some of the things that I have studied in the short time I have had the dairy herd here, and I just- want you to have a little thrill with me as I had this morning when we found that one of our cows, six years old has just dropped a bull calf. Now the arrival ol a bull calf may not mean anything to lots of people, but in this particular case I feel a great elation for the simple reason that this cow had produced in ten months more butterfat than any other Holstein cow of her age. She is a world record cow. .1 do not sup - pose we will ever have another chance to break a world record but we got a real thrill and we would like to have every dairyman have the same thrill. But there are a lot of other fellows that will have some of those thrills if we develop the purebred herds that are coming into this state. Dairying is only satisfactory when it con - tinues to be a profitable source of income as one of the farm major enterprises. We hear about propaganda all the time. We wonder if it is worth while and I don't know any better way to give you an answer to those questions than to call upon a man who has seen the dairy industry of the present generation develop throughout the country and who has been in a position to have his hand on the pulse of its development and to have a major hand in guiding its develop - ment, so I take great pleasure in presenting Mr. A.

            <seg id="p277">■ NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION most is the gathering of new visions and the grasping of new op - portunities. • . . It is my privilege to relate briefly factors essential to making dreams come true in the field of dairying. What is the dairy industry? ' How important is it to the welfare of our country? What has been done to develop this industry and what is there yet to be done to cany . . it forward and upward? Too many people consider the dairy industry small and insig - nificant. Only a few comprehend that the income from dairy products, by-products, worn-out dairy cows, veals, etc., amounts to more than one-fourth of the total agricultural income of the nation. If we had a few centers where the dairy industry was concentrated like the meat industry of Chicago, Kansas City, or Omaha, it would make itself more impressive, although of no greater importance. The dairy in - dustry is scattered and made up of small units ■which do not em - phasize its immensity or importance. The very fact that the dairy industry is made up of local units directed by persons patronizing them gives it a vitality and a strength that is of tremendous im - portance in directing, this industry and in establishing it upon a firm and solid foundation. PRODUCTION OF MILK STUPENDOUS ■■ . Not only is the value of dairy products in excess of any manu - factured product, but the quantity of milk produced is stupendous. If the yearly production of over fourteen billion gallons were placed in milk tank cars, to transport it would require over trains reaching across the 3,170 miles that separate New Yojk from San Francisco. If placed in cans and transported in express cars, it would fill solidly twenty-three tracks between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The one hundred twenty-one billion pounds of milk produced in • 1926 is difficult to comprehend even when stated in its equivalent of over one and a third billion 10-gallon cans' that if placed side by side would girdle the globe fifteen times in passing from Chicago westward across the United States over the Pacific Ocean, through Japan, Asia, Europe, . over the Atlantic, and then back to Chicago — a high - way of milk sixteen feet wide and two feet deep going around this [ world of ours. Turned into a canal like the Erie Canal, this milk would float the commerce of the 'Midwest from Chicago to the Gulf, with enough milk left over to fill a harbor that would float the U. S. Navy. We see huge tank cars of gasoline and filling stations located at every crossroad and marvel at this demonstration of the extravagance </seg>
            <seg id="p278">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of the American people. Yet the dairy farmers of the United States produce a quarter more milk than the nearly eleven billion gallons of gasoline that last year were consumed by automobiles, trucks, tractors, engines, and for other purposes. The total production of milk for 1926 was over sixty million tons,— nearly two tons, — or 440 gallons at every tick of the clock during the 24 hours of every day in the year. CONSUMPTION INCREASES FIFTY-ONE PER CENT The consumption of dairy products has shown a startling in - crease, one that is gratifying to milk producers. In 1916 the consump - tion of milk and dairy products was equivalent to 37 billion quarts of milk, as .compared with 57 billion quarts in 1926, an increase of over 51 per cent in ten short years. It is a matter of satisfaction to the dairy farmer and evidence of his efficiency that this increased consumption has been supplied with fewer cows and with consequent better profits to the producers. I Production per cow, even using the most conservative figures, has increased from 3,700 lbs. in 1916 to 4,700 lbs. in 1926 or a 27 per cent increase per cow. At the same time increasing population with no increase in number of cows has ■ brought the number of cows down from 225 to 189 cows per thousand consumers a decrease of 16 per cent. The increase in consumption of dairy products has been brought about in part by an increase of 17 per cent in the population of the United States in the past ten years, the yearly increase now being nearly two million people. Even more important, however, has been the effect of the increased per capita consumption of dairy products, an effect doubtless due to the improved quality of milk and the educa - tional programs that have brought before consumers the value of dairy products in the diet. Per capita consumption of milk and manu - factured dairy products in 1926 was equivalent to 484 quarts of milk, an increase of 29 per cent over the 374 quarts in 1916. While in 1916 the average consumption of dairy products was equivalent to two pints of milk daily for 100 million people, in 1926 it was 2.6 pints daily for 117 million people. This is an increase of over a glass of milk a day for each of the 117 million persons in the United States, with 17 million more people than there were ten years ago. The following: table shows how milk production and con - sumption have increased and how much our cows have increased in milk flow. </seg>

OVERPRODUCTION Since the inception of the dairy industry, fears have been con - stantly expressed that dairying is likely to be overdone. It seems to </seg>
            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION me more concern has been expressed about overdoing the dairy in - dustry than any other branch of agriculture. It is rather difficult to analyze this. Farmers do not; make dairying an important part of their work unless dairy products sell for relatively higher prices than other farm products. When dairy products are too low in price, it - is a- simple matter for every dairy farmer to sell a cow or two, More - over, one-third of our cows are not paying for feed consumed, and the understanding of the importance of good cows is greatly reducing this . number. . On January 1, 1927, there were 625,000 less cows than on January 1, 1925. This reduction in the number of cows took place when prices for dairy products were relatively higher than other farm com - modities. The work that has been done to advise the consumer of the importance and food value of milk and its products has been a tremendous factor in keeping demand ahead of supply. The increased ■consumption of one-third of a quart of milk per person per day brought to the dairy farmers in 1926 j over $500,000,000. There is still op- - portunity to increase the consumption of milk at least one-third if not one-half quart per person per day. Several sections of our country are consuming comparatively little milk, and several million more cows are needed to meet j this requirement. The years 1926 and 1927 are among the very best that dairy farmers have experienced. In 1919 prices of dairy products were a little higher, and so were prices of feed and labor. It can be said that in these years the dairy farmer was in a position to jmake more net profit than any time since the beginning of the dairy industry. It seems rather a strange coincidence, but nevertheless it is true, that as this dairy industry has developed, prices of dairy products have advanced constantly. This does not mean that there have been no periods of depression, but the trend of prices for dairy products has been constantly upward. TWe should not neglect to consider that the income of labor has been increasing during this same period and this should cause us to be interested in the laborer receiving a good compensation- and constant employment. I would not venture the as - sertion that there is no danger of overproduction because no man is wise enough to know just how well labor will be employed. Should there be a tremendous slump in the business of the nation and many people left without employment, I would expect to see prices of dairy products materially decline. If labor can be employed as it is now, I do not see danger of overproduction of dairy products. </seg>
            <seg id="p282">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE RELATION OF THE COW TO A PERMANENT SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURE The soil is the foundation of prosperity.' It is the foundation of civilization itself. There is no more important thing to consider in the advancement of civilization than the soil, for from it conies our food and the raw material for our clothing. It should be held sacred and passed on to the coming generation as good or better than we found it or we have not been true to our trust. Many times I have heard that prominent dairymen, Uncle Perry Goodrich, of my city, say that we do not own a foot of land; that we are only here for a short time and that the future generations have as much right to it as we have. Now, what relationship does the cow bear to keeping the soil fertile and full of its life giving properties? I sometimes think it would not be much of a stretch of the imagination to say that the very foundation of life is the good dairy cow, because she contributes so much to keeping the soil in a high state of fertility and provides a food of prime importance. How does she do it? Dairying cannot be made profitable unless most of the feed is raised. The best feed to raise for the dairy cow is that which is rich in protein, namely, alfalfa and clover; in fact, all of the legumes. In growing clover, alfalfa, soy beans, and cowpeas, we enrich the soil as well as provide a protein feed for the dairy cow. This is accomplished through nitrogen-gathering bacteria of which we all have an under - standing. Some scientists advise plowing under the legume crops, claiming that they will be more valuable to the soil than when fed to cows. This may be true, but I consider it uneconomical. The dairy farmer who feeds his hay to his cows has a splendid market for it. In sections where the dairy cow is not kept, especially in the West, it sells in the stack for $8 to $10 a ton, and in Wisconsin it sells readily for $20 to $25 a ton. The dairy cow, therefore, not only supplies a market, but she advances the price of hay. Further - more, she returns 60 to 70 per cent of the fertility to the soil which was necessary to produce this crop. Butterfat is largely condensed sunshine. There is no fertility in butterfat. The air is filled with carbon dioxide which makes carhobydrates. When 100 bushels of corn arr sold about $12 to S15 of fertility is taken from the farm. Every thinking person knows that the soil must be fed, and it is not an uncommon practice to use so good a feed as cottenseed meal for sup - plying it with nutriment; 300 lbs. per acre is the usual application. The dairy farmer would not think of following this practice, but he sells cottonseed meal, oil meal, bran, corn, and various other crops to his cows, and she hands back to him a large part of all the elements he needs for the soil. The cow also utilizes the feeds that are wasted on the farm with - out her. The cornstalk, which carried from 30 to 35 per cent of the </seg>
            <seg id="p283">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION total feeding value of the corn plant, is wasted feed in many secaons. Of course, plowing under cornstalks enriches the land by adding humus to it, but it is better to feed them to the cows and then to the soil. When we consider the relationship the dairy cow bears to the land and what the soil means to the people, how the cow utilizes waste that would not bring the farmer any return without her, how she in - creases the price of other farm products, how she adds to the price of hay we raise on the farm and that she is the most economical pro - ducer and produces the most perfect food on earth, can you not see that this animal has a great, future? Can you conceive that this animal will go down to destruction before civilization is ready to pass? As we go forward in this country and develop and become in - telligent about our diets, the dairy cow will hold a prominent place in agriculture. CASH INCOME The good dairy cow not only pays well, but she pays cash. The daily return which she brings to her owner is a great stabilizing force and to a large extent takes the gamble out of dairying. The wheat fanner plants his seed in the spring and he markets his wheat in the fall. He has an income but once a year and he is not certain what the price of wheat will be in: the fall, even though it be high at the time of planting. With the dairy farmer he knows approximately every day what is being paid for his product, and with this cash income he buys more discriminately, which is a contributing factor to his success. The amount a dairy cow pays in wages to her owner depends upon what kind of a cow she is. Some cows do not pay any wages. *When their feed is figured at market price they do not pay for their board. The Minnesota Experiment Station, a year or more ago, gathered information on 21 dairy farms in. Steele County. The purpose of this work was to gather information concerning the management of these farms, the approximate \ cost of producing various agricultural crops and to determine as far as possible the net income from these crops. On these farms the sale of butter fat furnished 35 per cent of the income, the sales of dairy cattle and veal calves 17 per cent, •a total of 62 per cent of thej income. Next to the dairy enterprise, hogs were most important as I a source of income, furnishing 25 per cent of the total. From a bulletin issued by the Minnesota Experiment Station, I take the following statement. "The return per hour for time spent in caring for cows among 21 cost co-operators in Steele County varied form 7 to 77 cents. Three obtained 65 cents or more. The cows produced an average of 192 pounds of butterfat per year. The average return per hour of labor was 20 cents above market prices for feed and other ex - penses. If the charge for barn rent and horse labor is ignored, the </seg>
            <seg id="p284">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE average return per hour for man labor was 26 cents. The principal factors needing attention in order to get a return of 65 cents or more per hour are: Feeding in proportion to production,- feeding adequate rations, having adequate all-season pastures, weeding out the. poor producers, having cows that are sired by pure-bred bulls of high pro - ducing ancestry, effectively controlling losses from abortion, tuber - culosis, garget, and other diseases, and a reasonable overhead for bams and equipment." It was shown in this bulletin that high production and high return per hour usually went together. IMPROVING OUR HERDS BRINGS NEW PROBLEMS IN FEEDING A different system of feeding is necessary to meet the requir - ements of high producing dairy herds than for those giving but little more milk than essential to meet the needs of their calves. In this state, adapted to growing both alfalfa and corn, the dairy farmer has easy opportunity to meet the feed requirements of his cows. It may be said that our 22,148,000 dairy cows in the United States are underfed, and it is my estimation that we are not pro - ducing more than enough protein to meet the requirements of 18 to 19 million dairy cows. If it were possible to take the feed which 22,148,000 cows consume and give it to 18 or 19 million, we would be able to produce as much milk from these fewer cows, and the profits would be many times larger. The natural advantages which you have for growing alfalfa and all other legumes leave no excuse for not providing all your dairy herds with an adequate quantity of protein so necessary for milk pro - duction. I do not know of any crop that supplements corn silage as well as alfalfa hay. A ration made of 35 to 45 lbs. of corn silage and from 10 to 20 lbs. of good alfalfa hay will provide enough nutrients to permit a good cow to produce in a year 6,000 to 8,000 lbs. of milk containing 225 to possibly 300 lbs. of fat. A ration made of these two feeds is better by far than the average ration fed to dairy cows of this country. However it isn't wise in the light of the experience which Hoard's Dairyman has gathered from many dairy farms and its own, to use only alfalfa and corn silage in the making of a dairy ration. Some grain, preferably a mixture made from three or four different kinds, should be used for supplementing these feeds. Dairy farmers who follow this practice are the ones that are pro - ducing the most and are returning the greatest profit. ADVANTAGES OF ALFALFA AND CORN It is like carrying coals to Newcastle for me to mention the value of alfalfa and corn in this state. I shall not dwell at length concern- </seg>

In securing material for these articles, he visited many farmers throughout the Middle West who had been growing sweet clover and he had done some experimenting hSelf at his own farm and at the Illinois; Experiment Station. As you know, sweet clover may be sown with any crop like barley oats, or wheat. When the nurse crop is removed, the sweet clover comes on very rapidly, and when it grows to the height of a foot or more cattle may be turned on it. Usually by the first of August it mil be ready for cattle in this latitude. It is well not to pasture swee </seg>
            <seg id="p286">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE clover too close the first year as there is danger of injuring the crop the following season. Professor Fraser found that a little over a half acre of sweet clover would support a cow a month or a month and a half the first season. The second year less than three-quarters of an acre would support a cow about four months. This means that the old and the new seeding would pasture a cow 5% to 6 months each year. It has been found that one acre of good sweet clover pasture provides four times as much feed as an acre of blue grass. Blue grass is one of the most disappointing crops we can use for pasture, at best it provides fped for only 60 to 90 days. Of course, it grows in places where no other grass grows, and it does fairly well with very little or no attention. It has worked its way into our system of farming with very little effort. Sweet clover in too many instances has been considered a weed and a valueless forage crop. The Wisconsin Experiment Station has founri that blue grass pastures can be improved materially by sowing - them to sweet clover. It must be remembered that sweet clover is a biennial, and if it is to be used for pasture some should be sown each year. The new seeding can be pastured six to eight weeks in the fall and all next year. It comes on early in the spring and the cattle can be turned on it when it is six to eight inches high. It is well to have enough stock to prevent the sweet clover from becoming too large, because when it becomes too large and woody, cows do not eat it freely. It is the practice of some farmers to cut sweet clover pasture for hay if too many of the plants get beyond the grazing stage, but it has been observed that it is better not to do this. If thp plants become to'^ large, it is better to leave them standing than to attempt to improve the pasture by mowing. Growing sweet clover requires about the same attention in the preparation of the seed bed and quantity of seed as alfalfa does. I find it is the practice of some good farmers to sow sweet clover with all their grain crops. They do this to improve their land as well as to provide pasture for cattle. COW TESTING ASSOCIATIONS Successful dairying depends not only upon feeding the cows .well but upon selection of capable animals. Low producing cows of this country are being gradually eliminated and we may well congratulate ourselves upon the progress that has been made. In other words, we have decreased the cow population and materially increased milk pro - duction. I can not urge too strongly the testing of cows for the pur - pose of determining whether they are helping to keep the farmer or whether the farmer is keeping them. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE PA1RYMB.VS ASSOCIATION- There are conditions in your state where the poor cow will yield a profit, and it is far better for farmers to keep that kind of cow than to keep no cow. It is not necessary, however, for a man who catches the vision of the value of the good cow to be long without one for through the selection of some good dairy bull it requires but a few years to secure a herd of good producing cows. The day is fast passing when we can hope to continue farm operations by the rule of the thumb. One of the reasons why agriculture has been passing through a period of depression is the new demands for a forward step m agricultural practices. We must have more capable cows if dairy farming is to be made really profitable. PROVEN SIRES The cow testing association not only locates good and poor cows but also locates good bulls. We have not made use of this part of the cow testing association until recently. Last year over 1000 bulls in cow testing associations became proven sires; that is, sires capable of producing daughters with high records. When inquiry was made con - cerning them, over 800 had been- sold to the butcher. We must get a keener understanding of the value of the proven sire.' The profit be - tween the bull that will sire animals capable of producing 250 to 350 pounds compared with animals that will produce 350 to 450 pounds of fat is tremendous. I am fully cognizant of the prejudice against the mature bull. which is more or less unruly and difficult to handle. We must submerge our prejudice and lay plans to handle old bulls if we expect to establish -breeding upbn the proper basis. On a recent visit to the Bureau of Dairy Industry I discovered they had records of bulls that had advanced and lowered production of herds. Here are the results of two of them: A pure-bred bull was bred to dams that produced on the average 7,890 lbs. milk con - taining 425 lbs. fat in "a year. The daughters produced 2,439 lbs. of milk less and 110 lbs. of fat less than their dams. Another pure-bred bull was bred to dams that averaged 8,521 lbs. milk containing 489 lbs. fat in a year and the daughters of this bull averaged 13,486 lbs. milk 675 lbs. fat. This' bull increased the production per cow 4,965 lbs. milk and 186 lbs. fat. Doesn't this, indicate the necessity of proving a sire before he is extensively, used? I Of course, consideration should be given to type as I do not believe it is necessary, when procuring high producing animals, to disregard beauty of form. The true breeder will secure both good type and good producing animals. MUST PUT HONOR IN PRODUCTS ...... We have many opportunities to improve the quality of our dairy products.

Science has not yet discovered how to make bad flavored milk and cream delectable." In the city of Bagdad lived Haykem, the wise one, and many peo - ple went to him for counsel, which he gave freely to all, asking nothing in return. There came to him a young man who had spent much but tfot little. He said, "Tell me, wise one what shall I do to receive the most for that which I spend?" Haykem answered, "A thins- that is bought or sold has no value unless it contains that which can not be bought or sold. Look for the priceless ingredient." "But what is this priceless ingredient?" asked the young man. Spoke then the wise one, "My son, the priceless ingredient of every product in the market place is the honor and the. integrity of him who makes it and markets it. Consider his name before you buy." We must put in our dairy products that which can not be bought or sold. We must put honor in our work which will not only increase the consumption of dairy productions, but will bring better prices for &lt;= quality products. I could cite many instances of 1 increased consumption of butter and cheese when the consumer has been able to purchase quality products. DAIRYING IN WISCONSIN H occurs to me that it is not out of place to give just a mere out - line as to how ami why the dairy industry has become such a large, part of the income of the farmers of Wisconsin. In the early years of our state, and for a period of 30 or 40 years, wheat growing was the chief crop. At this time farmers were in rather severe circumstances. Land that had been growing wheat con - tinuously for a third of a century did not produce profitable yields. Seven and eight bushels per acre was the average crop. Land sold for $15.00 an acre; farm buildings were poor and farms heavily mortgaged; the whole agricultural situation was discouraging and many people left this state to seek newer fields where they could grow wheat. It is estimated at this time, that the yearly income from the dairy cows was about one million dollars. This was in 1872 when the Wisconsin Dairymen's Association was organized and began to direct itself to the building of a larger dairy industry in Wisconsin. Not all has been well with our agricultural conditions in Wisconsin the past six or seven yoars, but they have not approached in any way the situation as was fdUnd in the early '70's. We have not received for our products all that was desirable, and a few instances can be </seg>

DAVIS: I think I could add nothing to what Mr. Glover has told you and I hope that his message you heard today you will take to your community and tell the other folks' that there is" a little hope for agriculture and a little hope for dairying. Fundamentally we must have good cows if we are going to have successful dair'ving. And good o.ows means that we have got to find out which of .those four-footed animals that we have in our barns are doing a profitable work. You have all seen the kind of man that could pick out the good cows ,n his herd. But the man who can pick out the good cows in us herd, without a record is either a magician or a common ordinary liar, and I am inclined to believe he is the latter. You just can't tell &gt;Jow the cow testing association, the bookkeeper for cows; dairy herd improvement association, is what it is now called, but I am of the old school and I helped organize the first, cow testing association and it is hard, for me to change the name; will point out to you the good cov.-s in your herd . Those associations are doing the thing that Mr. Glover mentioned, in raising production. I think it is only fitting mat the cow testing or dairy herd improvement association ' should hear from a man who has also had a lot of experience in the dairy line He knows how they are organized. He is now. the editor of the [Dairy Farmer, one of our large national papers in dairying, and I take a lo't of pleasure in presenting Mr. E. M. Harmon, who is going to talk on "The Cow Testing Association." MR. HARMON: Mr. Chairman, Ladies anil Gentlemen. Rapid changes have taken place throughout the entire industrial and business world during the past few decades. ■ The changes in the agricultural industry, while just as great, have not in all cases been so noticeable. Twenty years ago when the first dairy herd improvement association in this country was organized in Michigan, there were probably few people who realized what a tremendous influence it was to exert on the dairy industry in later years. In- fact, it would be hard to estimate even now just how great the.ee changes have been, or how important has been the influence of the vast number of dairy herd improvement associations that have been organized since that time. Census figures on the cow popula- </seg>
            <seg id="p290">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE tion and production even as late as twenty years ago are not entirely satisfactory. We do know that from 1920 to 1926 the total milk pro - duction in this country has increased from 89,000,000,000 pounds per year to 120,000,000,000 pounds. During that same time there has been an actual decrease in the number of dairy cows on farms of 7 per cent. This would mean that the actual production per cow has increased during that time from 3800 pounds of milk per year to over 5100 pounds. This represents an increase in revenue of some - thing like a billion dollars a year to the American dairymen, to say nothing of the increased soil fertility and better balanced system of farming;, which have resulted, and which in turn will bring additional revenues. Such a figure is far greater than any that I have heard mentioned by any of the farm relief advocates. The dairy herd improvement as - sociation of the country, through the introduction of better methods of ■ feeding, breeding, care and management, and through their influence in eliminating unprofitable practices and inferior cows are largely entitled to the credit for this tremendous increase in revenue. There can be no question about the value of these associations. In every state, in every community where we find them in operation we find outstanding examples of the increased profit and prosperity which has followed. As a result of this influence dairymen throughout the country are coming to realize that it is only the reasonably high producers that are profitable. Several years ago when feed prices were lower than they are now I had occasion to analyze upwards of a thousand of these records. In this particular case I found that with the cows which averaged 100 pounds of butterfat per year, there was an average feed cost of 51 cents per pound for producing butterfat. This charge in - cluded nothing but the feed and pasture and did not take into consi - deration labor, interest, taxes, and other items above feed cost. In this same group of cows, which came from the same herds, those which averaged 400 pounds of butterfat per year produced it at a feed cost of 17 cents per pound, or just one-third. Converted to terms of four per cent milk equivelent, this would mean a feed cost of 68 cents per 100 pounds of milk with the better producers and .$2.04 with the inferior ones. Another similar illustration came to me just recently. In going through a herd of about 50 Holsteins the herdsman pointed out two good looking grade cows, and asked me which of the two I considered the better. There was so little difference in them apparently that I could not answer the question to my own satisfaction. The records, however, showed that for the past year one of these cows had pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION duced butterfat at a feed cost of 26 cents per pound, while the other had. consumed 51 cents worth of feed for every pound of butterfat produced. Similar records for several years back told the same story. Such contrasts must be eliminated. No business can tolerate them and continue profitable. We can well contrast this with two merchants who have an article which they must retail at forty cents. One of them is paying- 51 cents for it, while the other is buying it for 26 cents. The one is doomed to fail. The inefficient dairyman is just as certain to be compelled to fall by the wayside. Such examples as this can be found all over the country, and their influence is being felt wherever dairy herd improvement associa - tions are in operation, and where dairymen are keeping records. It is true that we haven't anywhere near the number of such as - sociations as we should have. It is also true that some of the foreign countries are far ahead of us in this work. We might as well admit these facts and face them as such. Doubtless there are reasons why testing has not gone forward as fast in this country as it should have. Personally I believe that one of the most important of these reasons is that in far too many cases the association has not proved its value to the man who joined. Too many men retain their membership in such associations for only a few months, up to two or three years, and before they have reached the point where they can capitalize on their results and use the information they have secured to do a real job in building profitable herds, they drop out. In this connection I might mention a statement made last spring by Mr. Paul Burchard, secretary of the Wisconsin Dairymen's Associa - tion. He stated that while only about 3 per cent of the Wisconsin cows are now on test in dairy herd improvement associations, he is reasonably sure that something like 10 per cent of them have been en - rolled at some time or other. What he said of Wisconsin I think is equally true of most other sections. Probably one. of the reasons for this is that a good many so - called dairymen are not capable, themselves of getting the most good out of an association. Some dairymen refuse to interest themselves in these records to the point of studying them. I have even known of cases where the tester reported that month after month he would find the record book in the same! place, and with the same dust on it that had accumulated ever since he was there the month before. Such men are simply tolerating the tester and the association and must have their interest awakened if they are to receive any good from it, or to be an asset to their organizations. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">HKI'OKT OF NEBRASKA STATR BOAKI) OF AGRICULTURE On the other hand, I think that some of us have done the wrong kind of a job of selling the record keeping idea. I myself spent nine years in dairy extension activities, much of which were devoted to dairy improvement associations. Personally, I will have to plead guilty in a good many cases during the first few years of urging record keeping on the basis of the sale value of the records. Certainly these records am worthwhile from that standpoint but the sale value of the 'lain- improvement association record is a very little thing compared to the big results which the members should get. As one enthusiastic association member, whom I know especially well, used to say, "These records are to the dai;yman what the cash register is to the business man. They are our business guides. They serve as a means of eli - minating the leaks and of putting our dairy operations on a profitable businesslike basis." When we get that idea across in its fullest mean - ing, up neod have no fear of the future of our testing and record work. At the present time there are many dairymen who are actually afraid of dairy heivi improvement association records. This applies not only to men with grade cows but also to purebred breeders. Doubtless many people would want to challenge that statement. How - ever, from personal experience I know that it is true. To prove it, we need only to no down the road in any section of the country and talk to every dairyman with whom we come in contact about such associ - ations. We will find that a large percentage of them will tell us' that they believe such associations are all right, but are simply waiting until they can got a barn built, a silo up, a good stand of alfalfa hay or something else which they feel at the present time is handicapping them in th" milking of big records. In other words, they, .are afraid that their records will not measure up to those of their neighbors. Anyone who ha* had his ears to the ground and worked closely with associations knows this to be true. I firmly believe that this is due in a large measure to our methods in selling the dairy herd im - provement association idea, and to the publicity which we have given to individual records. It has undoubtedly caused lots of men to look to thi = as the primary purpose of these organizations. I can point to case after rase where associations have been wrecked for no other reason than this. It is argued by some that this sort of publicity is all light, and even if it is not all right, it cannot be stopped. Dairymen who have these records are certain to commercialize thorn. Doubtless they will, and I would be the last to say that they should not. However, this is one case where the spectacular thing, or the one which makes a good news story, is not the point which is of primary importance. I believe that it can be minimized. How much better and how much more far </seg>
            <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION reaching effect can be secured through stories and publicity dealing wth increased profits and better living, which has come as the result of using: a high class herd sire, a comfortable dairy barn or a balanced ration. During the last three or four years that I spent in dairy extension work I do not believe that I ever once : mentioned pubhcly or through publicity the sale value of cow testing association records, and I am thoroughly certain that this had a strong tendency to make for better dairy herd improvement associations in Missouri. It is of utmost importance that every member of such an associa - tion be made a good member and one who thoroughly backs the or - ganization. One member lost is likely to mean a lot of prospective members shaking their heads and asking doubtful questions. On the other hand, one member permanently sold on the idea is almost certain to mean that others will follow. It is hard to estimate how much farther advanced this work would be in this country if the associations had done a one hundred per cent job of convincing every man who has joined of their value. We need to pay more attention to the member who is only half sold. It used to be a favorite hobby of mine to tell our testers not to worry particularly about publicity to the man who was thoroughly sold on the organization, but if necessary to lay awake nights figuring stories and local publicity which! would help convince the man who was only half sold. I used to tell them not to worry about the man who was already studying his records, but to devise every means possible of finding some way of interesting the weaker and less interested members. In fact, they are the ones who really need the association. The poorer a man is, the greater his need of money, and the poorer and less profitable his herd, the greater his need of this association in getting rid of the leaks and building profits. I believe that continually emphasizing these points helps to make the kind of associations that will last over long periods of time and that will do a real job of putting communities on the dairy map. The steady, consistent growth in numbers and strength of these or - ganizations in Nebraska would indicate that you are doing a splendid job along that line in this state. : The dairy herd improvement association should be the business guide of. its members. It should be their best means of maintaining contacts and of applying the worthwhile information which comes to hand. As such it should develop the leadership necessary to maintain it and to spread its influence throughout the community. In any locality where there is not a steady, uniform increase in associations and in sentiment for them, there is something wrong. When they are functioning as they should, they will serve the dual purpose of putting </seg>
            <seg id="p294">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE dairy farming operations on a business basis and of elevating the standards of living. In this connection I have in mind a brief survey made a year ago and covering eleven Minnesota associations with 280 members. Among these members 108 had farm lighting plants, 97 had complete water systems, 257 had kitchen sinks and nearly half the homes were equipped with heating plants. This is the sort of utilization of pios - perity which should come out of the leadership which these associ - ations develop. It is the kind of prosperity that will keep the best boys and girls on the farms, and continue to elevate the standards of American dairying and dairy farm homes. Times are changing. We want free mail delivery,, automobiles, modern homes, pleasure trips and hundreds of other things our ances - tors never dreamed of. One of these days we will all want to own our individual airplanes. We would not be satisfied with the anti - quated methods and inconveniences that our grandparents tolerated. But we must pay for these pleasures and comforts. In order to do it we must eliminate inefficient producers and inefficient methods. The 7,000,000 so-called dairy cows in the United States which do not even pay for the feed they eat are not helping us out of our present financial depression, nor are they helping to pay for automobiles and water systems for the home. Cash register methods are the only ones which will keep us up with the fast pace industry is setting, and give a comfortable, pros - perous living to the dairyman. Just in proportion as we adopt these methods, in that proportion will we bring satisfaction, contentment and prosperity. Clear thinking and intelligent action are the only hopes of the American dairyman. Both demand the adoption and application of business methods to our industry. PROF. DAVIS: Mr. Harmon has emphasized to you the im - portance of these organizations of dairymen for dairymen, and what they have been doing, and one of the important parts of our dairy as - sociation meeting is the little ceremony that goes with the awarding of some little recognition for the achievement in these herds. But before we have that little ceremony I have just about three or four minutes of business to transact. We will do it very rapidly. First I will call for the report of the nominating committee.

We wish to commend the work of the dairy clubs and cow testing associations and all efforts that, have been used by various societies and clubs to promote interest and information on the dairy industry.

            <seg id="p296">KKPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATR BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is not your dollar so much, we want your interest, that is the im - portant thing. The Nebraska State Dairymen's Association has co - operated very largely with the State Extension Specialist of Dairying, p.-.ii'the Nebraska Dairy Development Society in the organizing of dairy herd improvement associations, and I want to introduce to you Mr. M. L. Flack, State Extension Agent in Dairying. MR. M. L. FLACK: Dairy Herd Improvement Associations are what were formerly known as Cow Testing Associations, the name having recently been changed. This, I believe, is a step in the right dirf'Ction, the old name has often been confused with T. B. (tuber - culosis) testing. From now on the old name will be discarded. The past fouv or five years Nebraska has been coming to the front as a dairy state, and we hope it will not be long until it has few rivals. Much interest has been shown th" past few years in herd improvement work. This work being done largely through Dairy Herd Improvement Associations and Dairy Calf Clubs. In 1923, the state had one as - sociation operating in one county. Now we have sixteen complete or - ganizations in the state covering parts of twenty-eight counties. Several new counties are now in process of organization. The following is a brief summary of Herd Improvement growth: 1924 1925 1926 1927 Numbers of Associations 1 2 6 10 16 Number of farms enrolled 61 139 241 381 Number of cows tested 904 2462 3542 5860. Number of cows unprofitable 70 245 340 556 Per cent cows unprofitable T.T 9.9 9.6 9.4 In every case all associations have increased their average pro - duction from year to year. Two associations are well over the 300 pound butterfat average for all cows on test, they are namely: North Platte Valley and Lancaster County. Other associations are increasing their averape production and several are near the 300 pound butterfat mark. The results this past year were greater than we had anticipated. It is very difficult to tabulate all results, because there are a number of helps and influences that are never taken into account. Com - munities are materially helped by such organizations. Just this past year several dairy herd improvement associations were in a large measure responsible for calf clubs, this was true in York, Seward, Fillmore and Washington counties. In all these communities clubs were organized and old ones enlarged. </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA STATIC DAIRYMR.VS ASSOCIATION Results for 1927.

One of the many convincing facts that dairy herd improve - ment is worth while is the fact that average production for milk and fat has been increased from year to year. A good example of this increase can be shown by the Douglas County Association. Over a four year period this association increased from 260 pounds butterfat to 299.4 pounds, a total increase of 39 pounds butterfat on 500 cows. In. 1927 the Douglas County Association received 19500 pounds more butterfat from 500 cows than they did four years before. Also an increased profit of $7800 with butterfat figured at 40 cents a pound. We are now at the beginning of 1928 which we hope holds a bright future and prosperity for the dairy fanners. During this year we hope to have over twenty dairy herd improvement associations and many more calf clubs.

            <seg id="p302">:i:i'iil!T UK XKBRASKA STATK HOARD OF AGUICl'LiTL'RE SECRETARY'S REPORT There are several means by which the advancement of a state in :inj industry may be measured. We of course are interested in meas - uring the progress of Nebraska in dairying. First »e may note the increase in pounds of milk produced. In 1!&gt;2H this was 2,4B8,373,0D0 pounds while for 1!)27 it is estimated as 2,591,792,600 pounds. This is an increase of about five per cent. At the same time the number of cows has increased from between 590, - 000 to 595,000 in 1926 to an estimated 600,000 for 1927. The aver - age production of all cows in 1926 was 4160 lbs. and for 1927 it is 4.300 lbs. Not only then are the cows in Nebraska increasing in num - ber but the average production of these cows is being increased. This increase is marvelous when it is considered that less than 1% of the total number of cows are being tested through dairy herd improve - ment associations, so that their owners are able to know which cows are unprofitable and dispose of them. The number of dairy herd improvement associations is another index as to the advancement made by a state in dairying. These as - sociations have increased from 2 in 1924 to 16 in 1927, there being 6 new associations organized during the year, 1927. The number of pounds of creamery butter manufactured serves as a measure of advancement. In 1926 Nebraska manufacturers made 90,882,000 pounds of butter while present reports indicate a make of 95.000,000 pounds for 1927. Nebraska with her natural conditions for the production of large amounts of roughage and concentrate feeds should develop as one of the leading dairy states and all indications are that she is coming up to expectations. The position of Nebraska as a dairy state will de - pend mainly upon two things; the proper kind of cows properly cared for, ami the proper kind of dairymen in charge of them. Nebraska must have "dairy-minded men". "Dairy-Minded Man" ■ !;i successfully managing a dairy herd, the man is the first essen - tial. So matter how favorable conditions may be or how good the mark. I ■, the man must at heart he a "dairy-minded man" or the profits will n it be what they should. The right kind of cows are indispensable and the proper kinds of fepd an? a necessity, but both would fail to bring the desired returns if the man behind them failed to give the proper care and manage - ment. Cows of quality must be fed milk producing feeds in sufficient </seg>

A cow that SZ *h ge T ntity of milk is often notional and has v**y ***** about the way she wants her feed arranged and the way she is milked.

Photographs of the cows and their daughters were mounted and placed on a continuous moving belt, while the bull was standing in the pas - cure in the background. This device was built at an approximate cost of $100 while if purchased would have cost at least ?350. A miniature windmill, pump, milk of cream cooling tank and ?tock tank, were assembled to show a simple but effective method of arranging a cooling system for milk and cream on the farm. Some of this State Fair exhibit material was sent out to county fairs to be displayed there. Other exhibit material was sent to organi - zations and individuals throughout the state for use at dairy meet - ings. We are hoping that in future years a greater number of or - ganizations and individuals will request the secretary to supply them with exhibit material. This exhibit material is for the use of anyone in the State of Nebraska. The association sponsored as usual the annual student, breeders and cow testers dairy judging contest held during Organized Agri - culture. Medals were given to the five high men in the breeders and students contests and to the two high men. in the contest for cow testers. A cup was given to the winning team representing dairy herd improvement associations throughout the state, and a medal was pre - sented to each member of the team. Three speakers of national reputation were secured for the annual meeting. A record crowd attended this meeting. At the annual meeting medals were presented to owners of herds of five or more cows whose average production was more than 300 pounds of butterfat. The owner of the herd with the highest aver - age production of butterfat was presented with a gold medal while the owner of the second high herd received a silver medal. The dairy herd improvement association having the highest average butterfat production for the year for all herds was given a large trophy cup. The cow tester adjudged to be the most efficient in his work for the year was given a medal. The winning individuals in the annual high school dairy cattle judging and Babcock testing contests were given- medals. These con - tests are sponsored by the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. Kach member of the winning dairy demonstration in each county was presented with a medal in recognition of their supremacy in their work. The dairy cattle and dairy products team representing the Uni - versity of Nebraska at the National Dairy Show at Memphis, Tennes - see were supported financially to the extent of one hundred dollars </seg>

In addition the herd owner is enabled to intelligently select calves for replacements in the herd. Should he desire to dispose of his calves, a good price can always be obtained for them, as there is a strong demand for good calves from cows with high production records for members of Boys' and Girls' Dairy Calf Clubs.

Mr. Shelby Ramsey, Seward, Nebraska, a member of the Lan - caster-Seward Association, says, "Before we had our Dairy Herd Im - provement Association I noticed- that most of the people had been feed - ing corn fodder and stalks and in the main were not getting very much milk. Now it is a different story, they will ask you about the different feeds in your ration and how much milk your cow is giving. These association records show what the cows are and what they are doing. They so even farther, not only showing what the cow is doing, but what it costs for her to do it. That influence is spreading quite rapidly among the people in my community. I think we have been very fortunate in having: splendid testers. Our testers have been princes among men and have been quite a benefit in arousing interest. But we hope that in a short time our further advance will be shown and that our present association is just commencing to wield the influence that it can in the community. We hope to pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION ■ ' ■ ■ '-' ; duce an influence which -will keep up and will spread until we stand second to none in the United States in the Dairy Herd Improvement Association work," s Mr. Ray Hindmarsh, Fremont, Nebraska, a member of the Tri- County Association says: "I joined the Association to leam what my cows were doing, to weed out my herd and leam more about feeding. The tester had visited my place but a couple of months when I could see that there were cows on the red side of the ledger. They promptly went to the block. I learned that I was feeding unpro - fitably. Many times when a man comes to buy cow, heifer or bull, he wants to know the production of dam, how many daughters or how many sisters you are keeping in your herd, what their records are over their dam's record, how much of an increase over the previous year's record. None of these questions can be answered unless you have Herd Improvement Association records. "I'm for the Dairy Herd Improvement Association." Mr. Charles Rosacker, Omaha, Nebraska, a member of the Douglas county Dairy Herd Improvement Association says: "All I know about cows when it comes to testing and some of these other points is the knowledge that I gained when I joined the Dairy Herd Improvement Association. "For one thing we noticed" that the milk given by the cows from a certain sire that we had in our herd began to show up better. We had six old cows and their daughters on test. We started them on test at the same time and found that the daughters milked 50 per cent better than their dams. We began to know the influence that one sire had on the -herd. One thing in particular that I want to emphasize: I used to think it cost too much money to feed a common herd. Well I tested out and one year when I did not raise too much oats, I just mixed up our ration according to the prescription I got from the tester. -In two months time I had more milk on this balanced ration and it was costing me less money than it had before. I tried the prescription to find out what the results would be and they were very satisfactory." </seg>

Dairy club work develops more and better dairymen.

"Upon the calf's arrival, I began the fitting project for the State Fair. I fed her a growthy ration consisting of one-half oats, one - fourth bran, and one-fourth cracked corn with a small amount of oil - meal. The calf was. given milk, and all the alfalfa she wanted. The grooming process included the many small tasks necessary to make the best general appearance possible, and the training in posi - tion which should make her show to the best advantage. "At the. age of. seven months and three days, she won first in her class, and was champion female |of the Nebraska Boy's and Girl's Club show. She won seventh place in the open class" and first in the Inter - state. I exhibited her at the Gage and Pawnee County fairs. She won first, champion and grand champion in the club and open classes at each of these fairs. "With this calf as a foundation, my aim is to build one of the out - standing dairy herds in this breed. I shall always try to make the best better." Leonard Miller, a 17 year old club member of Kennard, Nebraska, says: "In the spring of 1925, I joined a three year dairy calf club project with a purebred Jersey calf, bought for me by the Ne - braska Dairy Development Society. During, the last three years, I have kept close records on her and showed her with moderate suc - cess. This last year I kept record on her milk production and the . profit which she made me. Her record was 6,4fl8 lbs. milk, 374.1 lbs. butterfat, with a total profit of j$126.81. I sold her bull calf for $60.00 at. six weeks of age. With the money I made at the Fairs as prize money, I have purchased three other heifers, so that my herd now consists of four head of well bred Jersey cows. Besides these cattle and dollars and cents I have gotten wonderful experience during the three years. I won the Union Pacific scholarship which I have used an i am thankful for. "In the future I hope to have a fine herd of Jerseys and be a dairyman." Elmer Young (age 17) club member of Havelock, Nebraska, says: "After spending four years in different projects of 4-H club work, I turned to the dairy project, feeling that there was an opening for better dairying in Nebraska. </seg>

During the past year, Liebers and Lawritson have devoted three months time to the selection and purchase of 626 dairy cattle for 262 farmers, club mem - bers and breeders. Fifty of these were registered bulls, 91 dairy calf club calves and 485 cows and heifers for foundation of herds. In addition to this direct personal service, we have been able to assist many other farmers by referring them directly to the breeders in our state who have a surplus for sale. The society keeps an up-to - date record of information of the purebred dairy herds in Nebraska which is available for any one desiring to locate breeding stock. On an average, two requests daily for service in locating dairy stock are received by the Society. It is the Society's policy to give preference to Nebraska breeders in the purchase of dairy animals. The Society makes no charge for this service except that the actual expense incurred is pro-rated by the puchasers. At every opportunity the society has discouraged the importation into the state of inferior, unprofitable or unhealthy dairy stock. Ne - braska will be benefited by the importation of good cows to replace the boarders and build up our cow population to at least five or six high producing cows on every farm. In building our dairy herds it is more important to emphasize quality rather than numbers and to make i </seg>

SUMMARY AND RESULTS OF FOUR YEARS ACTIVITIES During the past four years, Manager Liebers and Assistant Manager, Lawritson have: Discussed dairying at 925 meetings in 88 counties in the state with a total attendance of 258,293 people. Made on request, 2,692 farm visits. Rendered service to 11,856 additional persons by correspondence or telephone. Purchased a total of 1,987 dairy cattle for 784 Nebraska breeders, club memhers and farmers. The purchases consisted of 178 pure - bred .-ires with proper t\ pe and the .very best breeding. Four hun - dred twpnty were club calves with good breed and dairy type and out of dams who have produced 300 lbs. butter fat per year or more, and remaining 1,389 cows and heifers for the building of better herds. Assisted 162 Nebraska breeders in disposing of their surplus breeding stock, including 131 purebred bulls. Through effective cooperation with the agricultural extension de - partment, of the University of Nebraska increased boys' and girls' calf club work from 21 clubs with 199 members in 1923 to 64 clubs with 504 members in 1927. Through cooperation with the Dairy Specialist of the Agricultural Extension Department and County Agricultural Agent increased the numb r of herd improvement associations from two in 1924 with a membership of 61 testing 004 cows to the present 16 active associ - ations with 381 members having 5,860 cows on test. In the fall o{ 1924 the society in cooperation with the Burlington and North Western railroads conducted a tour through Wisconsin and to the National Dairy Show held at Milwaukee, Wis. Four days were spent visiting some of Wisconsin's best farms and dairy manufactur - ing plants which gave the 100 Nebraska dairymen on this tour an op - portunity to study Wisconsin's successful method? of production, manu - facturing and marketing of dairy products. This tour has resulted in the organization of more Dairy Calf Clubs, Herd Improvement As - sociations and the adoption of successful dairy practices in many Nebraska communities. The society cooperated with the railroads operating in Nebraska a state-wide dairy development campaign. In the fall of 1923, the </seg>

DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION - SUMMARY r Dairying: was discussed by Manager Liebers and Assistant Manager Lawntson at 376 meetings with a total attendance of 15,752 people .Eighteen of these meetings were devoted to the organization of herd improvemnt associations. One hundred eighty-two were for calf club work and 176 for general dairy development work. Made 934 farm visits on request for definite service. Two hundred Mty-f our of these were in the interest of herd improvement association work and resulted in securing 83 new members who enrolled 1,126 cows. Three hundred seventy-six dairy calf club members were visited and given instruction "on fitting, feeding and showmanship. Three hie™ VlSitS W3re made f ° r SCrvice On general dair y P r °- The society received definite requests for service through the of - fice from 1,284 individuals. Seven hundred five of these were by letter. Two hundred eighteen personal calls at the office and 361 requests over the telephone. The society purchased 626 head of dairy cattle for 387 Nebraska breeders, farmers and club members. These purchases afforded an opportunity to assist 72 Nebraska breeders in disposing of 189 of their surplus dairy stock. The cattle purchased, consisted of 91 calves for club work 485 cows and heifers used for the foundation of dairy herds and 50 pure - bred sires of which 39 were purchased from Nebraska breeders. The society cooperating with the Extension Dairy Specialist and County Agricultural Agents, organized six additional herd improve - ment associations with 2,318 more cows on test. Nebraska now has sixteen herd improvement associations with 381 herds testing a total of 5,860 cows in comparison with 10 associations with 241 herds testing 3,541 cows last year and two associations with 64 herds testing 904 cows, four years ago. Through effective, cooperation with the Agricultural Extension department, 13 new dairy calf clubs were organized with 121 addi - tional members. The total number of club members at the end of th» year does not adequately express the growth and development of club work u the state because each year a number of the boys and girls complete their three years project and many reach the age limit of club work and automatically drop out. Nebraska now has 64 dairy calf clubs with 594 members developing 601 dairy calves. *ai N S£ S^ttK StateS »»«»«» « Agriculture. BWr ly </seg>

Evening j . , • '•''.• 'I ' ' I ■ . '■■ ' H. J. GRAMLICH, Toastmaster Lincoln, Nebraska. MR. CHARLES GRAFF: We have all had a wonderful time here this week. This is the fourth banquet that we have been privileged to attend. There has been no let up of enthusiasm throughout the week at the meetings. This is the closing part of the program. We have a number of visitors here and we want you to meet them and hear them for a moment, so we have selected a fellow by the name of H. J Gramlich to preside at this program. Of course, if anybody talks over forty-five minutes and Gramlich does not call them down, we will. Professor Gramlich take the chair. PROFESSOR H. J. GRAMLICH: It is indeed a pleasure to be here this evening presiding: over this banquet. When I arrived and found the alarm clock, I thought it might take some of the pleasure away from the evening. Seeing the alarm clock reminds me of a story I once heard about a man who was applying for work The em - ployer looked him over and said to him, "Are you one of the dock - watching type of men?" The man. said, "No I am not In fact I iiave always worked in a creamery, and I am a whistle listener."

A colored maid once asked her employer for a quarter. Her employer asked, "What do you want with a quarter?" "Well," said the maid, "Our minister is going away for a vacation, and we want to give him some momentum." We have a number of speakers who will say a few words this evening. It gives me great pleasure to call upon a gentleman whd has traveled a considerable distance to be with us. He has a national reputation and comes from Wisconsin. Mr. A. J. Glover, Editor of Hoard's Dairyman has been affiliated with the dairy interests of the United States and of the world for the past forty years. MR. A. J. GLOVER: Some people were once going through an insane asylum and wanted to know the time. There was a clock in the room and they turned to one of the inmates of the asylum and said, "Is that clock rijrht?" "Is the clock right?" said the inmate, "Is the clock right? Do you think that clock would be here if it was right?" f sometimes think, Friends, that people who attend banquets and get at the speaker's table, if they were right, would not be there. I do not know what to say to you tonight. You have a fine state. I enjoyed the ride down here from Omaha. Each year the state looks better than the last. We have lots of problems in agriculture, but I think these meetings are going to make us consider them in a different light and that we are going to get out of them a different vision for agriculture. I hope that agriculture will never fall into the stupid condition of the man who had traveled much, gone all over the world, visited all the interesting places. That was before the 18th amend - ment. He once found a little group of men talking and he said to them, "I have traveled all over this world. I have seen everything and I do not care to see anything more. There is nothing more for me to see." After he got through bragging he stepped up to the bar and asked for a drink. A man who had had a little too much to drink, walked up to him and said, "'Excuse me friend but did I hear you say you had seen everything and heard everything?" "Yes Sir you did." "Well then friend, have you ever had delirium tremens?" "No, I haven't." "Well then friend you have never seen anything, or felt any - thing, or been any place or heard anything." That man thought that he had had all the experiences and visions necessary, but he met a man who discounted his idea of himself about one hundred per cent. I do not want to see agriculture get into the condition that it knows everything, that there is nothing more to be done in a substantial way to save it. I want agriculture to have a vision. What we need in agriculture is optimism. We have been doing damage by advocating things impossible to accomplish and then show- </seg>
            <seg id="p329">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION lnt ' U P this Sreat industry of ours in a light. that is not going to lead young people to engage in it. A lot of young people listened to a farmer from Minnesota speak to them. He told how he had started with a mortgage but at that time, owned over seven hundred acres of land. After the meeting the boys paid, "Send us more springers We want more optimism." Many have felt like leaving agriculture be - cause they saw no hope. They must get a vision of this great industry We must not be like the fellow who had traveled every place and had seen every^iing, and had no more to learn. While we "have sometimes taken a gloomy outlook at agriculture and have had our problems we are not going to get out of it by complaining. I do not know how seriously practical farmers have taken this talk. There were three fellows from three different states bragging about their states. Each was trying to prove that his state was the best. The fellow from Texas said, "You ought to see the alfalfa we raise in Texas. We cut a crop and before we can get the rake in the field to gather it up, another crop has grown. The man from California said, "I'm from the Imperial Valley in California and it is so hot there that the flies can't f?^\ G Pknt 0Ur vining. crops like melons and the vines grow so fast that they wear out the little melons, trailing them along on the fnT k H fr ° m NebfaSka Said&gt; " : have lived h « e *» Nebraska in his cornbelt for many years.

" '.I think that agriculture has a bright future. I believe that out of all this discussion, we are going to get a better understanding We eStl w T m ° dern Conveniences ' e°°d roads, motor trucks,, education, etc., but what sooner or later it is going to make agriculture one of our greatest and most profitable industries in this country I am reminded of the story of an old tramp who came into town and «St f a r n a , n \ asked for a hand - out No one «- him -y - hing to eat..

We are going to try to keep the program from becoming monoton - our. Negroes are known for their pleasure in using big: words. An old Southern negro used the word monotonous a great deal. One day he was asked what the word meant. "Well I can illustrate -what the word means," he said. "When a man has three wives, that is polygamy, when he has two wives that is bigamy, but when he has just one wife, then that is monotonous." So by way of diversification, we are going 1 to ask that the teams of the Dairy Department be introduced. I am going to ask Dr. Downs, the coach of the dairy team, to introduce the young men of his department. DR. DOWNS: It gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce to you tonight, the students who represented the University of Ne - braska at the 11th national students judging contest on dairy pro - ducts at the National Dairy Show held in October in Memphis, Ten - nessee. These students went to this show and competed with eleven other teams in the judging of dairy products — milk, butter, ice cream and cheese. The members of these teams are Addison Miller of Lincoln, Otto Dillon of Bostwick, and Erwin Hutchinson of Waverly, the third member of the team in the contest who was unable to be here on account of sickness. Also I want to introduce Mr. Elvin Frolik who was the alternate. These boys went down there with the idea of learning something about dairy products and while they did not win the contest, they felt that they came home with a better knowl - edge of equality in dairy products. PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: The Dairy Stock Judging Team was coached by Mr. Morgan and Mr. Hansen. . Mr. Morgan will introduce the boys and I will call upon Mr. Hansen later. MR. MORGAN: Most of you are aware of the fact that the dairy show was held in the land of the south — the land of cotton — in Memphis. The boys remember the city of Memphis as the city of strong coffee. The contest this year was one of the largest ever held. There were 32 teams competing, teams from practically every state in the Union and from Canada. Representing Nebraska, we had four boys. However, one or two of these boys can hardly claim residence in the Cornhusker State. In the first place, I want to introduce a boy from one of our neighboring states, Colorado, but very close to the Nebraska line — Harold Fulscher. The next member of our team is close home, from DeWitt, Nebraska and at the National this year he did exceptionally well for a Sophomore in college, winning a Holstein Friesian $400 scholarship, among almost one hundred boys and girls, many of whom had judged cattle in foreign lands, and came </seg>
            <seg id="p331">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION to Memphis for a free for all competition. Most of the teams were made up of seniors, ,so as a Sophmore in the University of Nebraska, he did exceptionally well. Mr. Elvin Frolik won the Holstein Friesian scholarship. Another member of our team also almost got out of the State of Nebraska but claims his home in Chappell.— Mr. Glenn Hed - lund. Austin Goth of Red Cliud, the fourth member of the team is not with us this evening. Nebraska placed second in the contest with thirty-two teams competing. PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: The fire trucks outside tonight re - mind me of children in school who were asked by their teacher what they would like to be. Tommy said he would .like to be a fireman. "Willie, what would you like to be?" asked the teacher. "A policeman," said Willie. "And Mary what would like to be?" "I would like to be married but I don't know how to get that way." The next speaker on the program represents the beef interests in the state, Mr. H. R. Smith who needs no introduction. MR. SMITH: It puts anyone in a difficult position to follow so noted a speaker as our friend from Wisconsin. I worked with Mr. A. J. Glover for many years. I think very highly of him. I will explain to you one reason for his fluency. He was once a minister. I do not know just why he resigned from the ministry but this is the story told to me about his early experience. He was doing very well, but some dissatisfaction was caused by his being very slow in delivering his messages. He was called before the board of deacons. They told him that he was talking too slow. He said, "Gentlemen, I want to say to you that the reason that I have been very slow in speaking is because I have lost my teeth and will have to get some new teeth." The deacons- said by all means to get teeth immediately. The next Sunday he talked so rapidly that no one could follow Mm. He was again called before the board. He said, "I sent to Sears and Roebuck for a set of new teeth and they made a mistake and sent me women's teeth." I am very glad to be here. I have enjoyed very much the session tonight. I have noticed tonight a number of old timers here and they have brought back many pleasant recollections. They and some of the men who have gone on, have laid the foundation for a great industry in this state. It is an industry that lacks great skill and knowledge. I don't know that I can offer a great deal of encouragement and yet it seems to me that conditions are rapidly improving. The new men who are coming in have reason to feel that prospects have greatly improved. This week, cattle sold in Chicago for the highest price every paid, not excluding war time prices. The cattle situation is ex - ceptionally good. We have reason to believe that these prices will </seg>
            <seg id="p332">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE continue for some time. With this state and its facilities for growing great crops of corn and alfalfa, the prospects are very good for young men to take up this work. The hog situation is different. There is a decline in exports, due to the increase in production of hogs in Ger - many, Denmark and other foreign countries. I believe the time is not far off when we will not have to depend on export trade. The time will not be long until we will have enough consumers to take care of the pork in this country. I don't want to spend very much time on this particular thing. These facts, you probably know. The country as a whole, as far as farming is concerned, is on the road to improvement. We are just now entering an era of better prices for farm products. I had occasion to visit in Kentucky a few weelcs ago and if people down there can make a living on that soil, ■we ought to be able to here. A Kentucky Colonel was asked what was his ideal dinner. He answered, "Corn whiskey, a good beefsteak and a dog." "What is the dog for?" he was asked. "The dog is to eat the beefsteak." I also heard a story told of two prohibition of - ficers who were trying to locate a still in the mountains. They ap - proached a boy and asked him where his dad was. "In the moun - tains," was the answer. "What is he doing?" they asked. "Making whiskey," said the boy. "Well you take us up there?" "I will for two dollars," the boy said. "All right we will go," the men said. "I must have the money before we go." They paid him the two dollars. On the way up the mountain, one of the men asked, "Why did you insist upon having the money in advance?" Why did you not wait until we came back?" "If I take you up to wh8re my dad is, you will never come back." That is the way they do things in Ken - tucy. I do not want to go away without just a word about a subject that I have been dealing with for several years and which has proved to be a very interesting enterprise. It is the great campaign in this country to get rid of tuberculosis. Various market, railroad men and bankers have been behind it. More than half of the breeding cattle have been tuberculin tested. It is reducing the losses in market cen - ters. Through this campaign, the percentage has been reduced as was indicated by government records to 1% last year. We are not getting the same decline on hog losses, but it is due to a new element in the situation, the fact that poultry causes disease in hogs. I want to say this, that so far as Nebraska is concerned, I do not know of a state in the Union that has made better progress in tuberculosis on the amount of money expended, than the State of Nebraska. The amount of the appropriation for this work has been small. Nevertheless, great progress has been made. We hope to have in a few years, a practi - cally free state. </seg>
            <seg id="p333">. . NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION - PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: At this time it would be very fitting to hear from some of the other teams. A story is told about Profes - sor Loeffel when he was in college. He wrote home to his father for $15 to buy an encyclopedia. His father wrote back and said, "I will not send you the $15 to buy an encyclopedia. I always had to walk when I was in school and you can do the same." Professor Loeffel will introduce the members of the meat judging team which represented the University of Nebraska in Chicago. PROFESSOR LOEFFEL: You are all interested in meat, if not from the standpoint of producer, then from the standpoint of con - sumers. Without a question, the more people learn about meat or meat producing animals, the better it would be for the livestock pro - ducer. A year ago, the National Live Stock Board at Chicago in - augurated the first meat judging contest. This year there have been held three contests. In the men's contest at Kansas City, Nebraska was represented by Cecil Means of Red Cloud, — he was high man — , William Snyder of North Platte, Louis Taggart of Lincoln, and Paul Jenkins of Gothenburg. In the Home Economics contest at Kansas City, we were represented by a team of Home Economics girls. In introducing these girls, I want to give credit to the Home Economics Department for their excellent cooperation, also to the packers and - retail meat dealers who have assisted us in coaching the teams. The members of the Home Economics Team are, Dorothy Norris of Laurel, Marjorie Schultz of Western, Mary Schaaf of Lincoln and Louise Genung of Cams. In closing, I want to serve notice on all of you, that if you ever try to sell beefsteak from worn out dairy cows when these girls order choice beef, you will get into trouble. PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: The other Animal Husbandry team, coached by Professor Derrick, I am sure you wish to meet also. Mr. Derrick came to us from Texas. The first introduction the boys of the north had to him was when he said to his first class of seventy-five Sophomore students, "Well boys, now I will carry you all out to the barn." . PROFESSOR DERRICK: When I say it is a pleasure for me to introduce one of these teams, I feel just a little bit reluctant this year. Just why, I do not know. Heretofore I was convinced that it was a real pleasure. But I have had to work, toil and cuss a little to get these boys along and all that took the pleasure out of the fact that I was trying to coach them for the team. But in spite of all this trouble, the^boys, under the guidance of Professor Weber won first at the National Western Show at Denver. In our system, Mr Weber takes the boys to the show in January and in the spring, he casts them on to me. In a way I think possibly it is the cast-offs he brings back to me. I worked with these boys just a short time in the </seg>
            <seg id="p334">itEI'ultT OF NKBKASKA STATIC DOAHIi OK AOUIClM.f I'UK summer and during state fair time, they were good enough to go back to Peoria and win first place. Mr. Robin Spence was fortunate enough to be high man in this contest. At Kansas City, in November the team did not fare nearly so well as they had fared in the previous contests. For some unknown reason, they slipped down to tenth place. That took the wind out of my sails. I did not know what to do from that time on, and particularly 1 with Chicago, the goal of our judging work, within two weeks of us. We were fortunate enough, even though we took tenth place as a team to have a high man in this contest. Cecil Means won the in - dividual honor by a record-breaking score. At Chicago, practically the same team that competed in the previous contest came back, I suppose to show me that they could do better than tenth place. After the smoke had cleared away, we found that we were in fourth place. We were very glad to be there. I was glad particularly when I stopped to think of the very keen competition at the International Livestock Show. There were some twenty-two teams, representing the states of the United States and provinces of Canada, sending their very best to the show to win the high honor. The boys who entered • this contest are Phil Snyder of North Platte, Cecil Means of Red Cloud, Arch Leu of Curtis. Mr. Leu is the black sheep among the - boys, in a way. He really is not an Agricultural Colltge Student. He comes from the school of Jewish Engineering. With all that handicap, he has made an excellent showing. Robin Spence conies from Crab Orchard. He saw the handwriting on the wall and with - drew from the Business Administration College. The other members of the team are Paul Jenkins of Lincoln and Louis Taggart of Lincoln. PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: We appreciate the efforts of these boy* and \\v know they worked hard to do justice to this institution. I will now introduce a man who is well known to the breeders of cattle, especially Guernsey cattle. Mr. Karl Musser is the Secretary of the American Guernsey Cattle Club of Peterboro, New Hampshire. MR. MUSSER: I must first pay tribute to your toastmaster be - cause of his correct pronunciation of my name. I did not have much to do with the selection of that name but have had one or two em - barrassing experiences with it. I went to the same college for a little while that H. P. Davis attended. I don't know whether anyone in Nebraska knows him. He went to school in Missouri. The first posi - tion I got when I got out of that institution was in Connecticut. The faculty was always assembled there the second week after college opened to be introduced and to get acquainted. I was one of the new members, as was a very good looking blonde. She was on the re - ceiving: line. I always have had a weakness for blondes. So when I </seg>
            <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA STATE DAlUYMBN'S ASSOCIATION saw this young lady, I figured about how I could play my time to have extra time with her. P. A. Downs knows her also and was . there at the same time. I was introduced to her as Mr. Musser. I worked fast and thought I had made considerable headway when it was her turn to introduce me and she said, "I want you to meet Mr Smear." It is useless to say that I changed my opinion of blondes. ■ It is really a wonderful experience to. come out into the Corn - husker State. I was raised in the Jayhawk State and have seen our football and basketball teams trampled to death so often that I have always had a desire to see what the people here looked like. I had a ride around your city and I could not but contrast your opportunities here and your great fertility of soil with that of the New England States. The fertility of the soil here is outstanding as compared with that of the New England States where I am working. The soil is so poor in New England that when they bury a man, they put fertilizer in the grave so that his soul will be up on resurrection day. I cannot help but tell you a bit about Mr. Glover.' We younger fellows in tins great agricultural industry have always looked to Mr. Glover for leadership and are always happy to have a chat with him. He wounded me deeply l ast night. At the table I heard him talking to Mrs. Davis and he said, "If I had been allowed to make two real wishes in my life, the first that I would make is that I would never I, be grey until after I am fifty. That wish has been granted The other one is that I would never be bald." Why he should say a thing like that in my presence is more than I can understand. I think on ! occasions of this kind, the people in the audience rather look upon us fellows who take this punishment as a bunch of experts and I wonder whether you really know what an expert is. Professor Kildee at Ames says an exdert is a common ordinary guy a long ways I from home. I am sure that a lot of us who sit back at the table and are expected to pass out wisdom would be very happy to sit here [ and hear you tell about your experiences and your state. We come to | you quite largely for education." My point of view of Nebraska in t dairying and agriculture has changed a good deal since I have been here ttus week. The pleasing thing that I get out of this meeting tonight is to hear these students announced and to see here men that ,,; I know farm and raise livestock for a living and to see some who . have courage enough to bring their wives. Agriculture is a family institution and I always like to see banquets of this kind where the women are represented. I lam. old enough and bald enough so that I can hand bouquets to wives without anybody thinking it is advertising I think you will agree with me that those men who have been sue , . cessful m agriculture have been aided by their wives TW v diooses to farm without the support of L w^TdoonS tSlS I Professor Davis and I were-talking today and we got to tJttJSS </seg>

The inspiration for my life work came out of just such a meeting. In my office is a grand - father's clock. One day 1 sat in my office trying to think of an in.-pi ration for a talk. 1 sat with my eyes closed. When I opened my eyes the door in the old grandfather's clock was open and there the pendulum was swinging back and forth. That pendulum that for over 100 years had been swinging bad; and forth making the same distance each trip. What a terrible thinjj it would be to be a pendulum making the same trip every day. 1 triod to draw a picture of the pendulum in the agricultural activity, especially in dairying. Many men turn away from dairying because of the tendency of the pendulum swinging, milking cows every day, doing the same thing over every day. I thought of the drudge of farming — some people think it is a drudge. Then my eyes fell upon the face of the clock. That pendulum never made the same trip. Every tick and every tock marked one more second in time. It was progress. Did you ever notice that the hands on the face of a clock never go hack? Those interested in agriculture doing those constant chores, the things that come to you to do, you are the tick and the tock that is creating a new second every minute, driving forward constantly into time this great industry of agriculture with your endeavor. PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: Marion Stewart and his bride are here this evening. Will they please stand? You probably all know that Senator Warner has a new baby. It seems that the Senator was in Waverly, the other day and had the baby in the cart. The Senator was crying and a Jew asked him why he felt so bad. He said he was just up to the minister to get the baby baptized. "The minister wanted two dollars, and I didn't have it," he said. The Jew gave Mr. Warner a five dollar bill. He took it and in a few minute came back smiling and handed the Jew three dollars. "Now are you happy?" said the Jew. "Yes, I am," said the Senator. "Well then, there are three people happy," said the Jew. "How's that," asked Mr. Warner. "Well in the first place, you are happy because you have the boy baptized, the minister is happy because he has the two dollars and I am very happy because I have three silver dollars for a counter - feit five dollar bill." We have just two or three other speakers on our program. The next speaker needs no introduction. Last night he posed before us as the king of trumps, but tonight he comes to us as simple George Jackson. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION MR. JACKSON: If we did not like the toast-master for his mean - ness, we could not like him at all. I have known him for a long time and have watched him develop. I am proud of him. He is known all over the United States as one of the best stock judges. His word • is authority.' He had a hard ' time getting his education. I can re - member when tills young; man was going through college. First he studied to be a minister. He studied four years for the ministry and "for four years failed, for lack of religion. Then he studied law. With the foundation he had, it did not- take long before he was admitted • to the bar. Then the state went dry. Here he is one of the authorities on stock of our country. We are proud. of him. I used to drive a stage in the mountains when I was a young man, before I married my first wife. An old stock tender could not get up in the morning early enough, so he sent down into a town for an alarm clock. His friend bought him a second hand one and took it up to him. The stock tender looked it over and said, "What makes it go . off" "You have to get up and pull the string to make it go off." his ...; friend answered. I think thatis the same kind of a watch that is here on the table. I know that the hands haven't moved a bit since we have been sitting here. PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: We have heard much of the four horsemen from Notre Dame but not so much about the four horsemen of the C. B. &amp; Q. Agricultural Department. Mr. Ford will tell us about the models that he has on the floor at this time. I . ' MR. FORD: 1 am very glad to be here where the west begins from out where the west is. Recently I was in Nelson, Nebraska with George. Just to show you what kind of a town he comes from, I I happened to meet a fellow that was the town musician. He was the -leader of the band. The height of his accomplishment was a mouth &lt; harp. He was the outstanding musician of Nelson. A band came to the town and this musician took great delight in this band, especially in watching the man with the trombone. He followed the band all | over town, all the time keeping close behind the man with the trom - bone. George took keen delight in watching this musician. Finally George went up to him and said, "Well Si, have you got it figured , "out yet?" "Not yet, but by cracky that fellow don't swallow' that thing every time he blows." This week while I have been here, I have heard Nebraska referred to as the pioneer state and I am rather young to be talking about development in this state but I think that Nebraska has made wonder - ful progress in the last three to five years. We were out a few years ago with a purebred sire special, trad - ji; ■' . ing purebred bulls for scrubs. We went out into the western part of </seg>
            <seg id="p338">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICrr.TI'nK the state. Professor Davis was to give the demonstration one day. He asked all the fanners using scrub bulls to bring them up. One fellow brought his bull onto the car to trade it for one of our fin£. purebred calves. Professor Davis worked hard to try to show the superiority of the purebred over the scrub bull. Professor Davis was going good and had gone into a great deal of detail on the wonderful pedigrees of this bull calf, the show herd winnings and its ancestry. He had gone over the confirmation of the two animals. He had pointed out the fine qualities of the purebred and had compared them with those of the scrub. He thought he was going good, but all of a sudden this fellow who was to receive the purebred bull said, "Hold on, and r- maybe you think that this bull that I have got here has not got a pedigree." He pulled out a big long sheet of paper with a gold seal j and read: j PEDIGREE OF SCRUB BULL "We warrant this bull to be an inbred calf, His form and style will make you laugh. He'll take no prize at a livestock show, But he'll eat and drink and maybe grow. He was born by chance in a suspicious way His mother died and his dad ran away. He is lousey as Heck and somewhat thin, But he's a damn good bull, for the shape he's in." PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: I know that this would not be a com - plete evening if I did not call upon a gentlemen who has meant much to Nebraska's agriculture. A man who typifies that expression which we often hear that the institution is but the shadow of a man. He has been the head of this institution since its infancy. I am sure we all realize the important work which he has done here. Dean Burnett. DEAN E. A. BURNETT: I suppose when one begins to re- . minisce, the audience thinks it is about time to pass out. I could not help thinking this evening as I review the week's program, of the year 1924, when we completed the old engineering building on the farm campus. We gave free lunches to all the members of organized agriculture during the week with twenty-five to fifty present every day, for two or three days and I suspect perhaps some of you are here tonight who were here then. I remember among that number, Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Bassett, Mr. Macintosh and Mr. McGinnis. I would like to ask whether anyone here in this audience remembers that parti - cular year. I was just thinking of comparing that with this week. Tues - day night, the great banquet presentation of Master Farmers, Wed- </seg>

I wish you many happy returns of this week and always we extend the welcome to you to come to tho Agricultural College and be our guests. PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: We will now have the announcement by Mr. Hansen of the dairy judging contest. . MR. HANSEN: A number of the participants i.i the dairy cattle: judging contest held yesterday, are here this f.vi.ninj. We were glad this year to have two outside dairymen with us to act as juduros, Mr. R. L. Holden of LaFayette, Indiana and Mr. E. M. Harmon of Des Moines. (The list of winners may be found on page 91 of this report). PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: We have with us the newly elected president of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. We will call upon him for a word of greeting. Mr. L. H. Daft. MR. DAFT: It is a little bit difficult to be tied on to the tail end of a program like we had here tonight. I thought I might have some distinguishing feature ■ about me by which you could remember me, but Karl Musser wears his hair the same way I do. I want to say, representing the Nebraska Dairymen's Association, it is a pleasure ! . to be at a table with distinguished guests. We get a lot of help and inspiration out of the messages that these men from out of the ; . .rtate have brought to us. This is the season of the year when every kind of industry balances its books and makes new resolutions and plans and has new ideas for the future. There are a lot of things we' have to charge to profit and loss, certain accounts become worthless. Every fanner can look back and see where he made mistakes. When 1 • we have, a series of meetings and gather together as groups of in - dividuals with the same ideas and the same aspirations, we take hold of the future with a deeper insight and wider outlook and more optimistic thoughts than in the past. When men like Glover and Musser and Harmon come out here and give us these messages of ! encouragement, it does us all good. As a citizen of Lincoln and of the I State of Nebraska, I want to tell you folks we like to have you come , to Lincoln and we like to have you come to Nebraska. h PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: There are a few here who have ex - pected to be called upon. I trust you will take the same attitude of the teacher when a boy came to school and said "Teacher, do you be - lieve that a boy should be punished for not doing a thing that should have been done."

            <seg id="p354">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE GREETINGS MRS. IDA WILKENS BERGER, President ; Another year has past since we met for Organized Agriculture. 1928 — just think of it! I am glad to see so many faces that I saw here last year, and wonder how many brought a friend or neighbor. It gives me great pleasure at this time to extend greetings to all of you. We hope that these three days will be days of "happiness hours" and may we each extend these hours of happiness that we have here experienced, to our home, our neighbors and our community. Each year in planning our program we are confronted with the following questions: What shall we have for our program this year? What topics will be interesting and helpful to the homemakers of Nebraska ? What theme shall our program center about? These and similar questions are asked by the program committee. As soon as the meetings of Organized Agriculture are over, plans 3 ' are begun for the coming year. Last year we tried a new plan. A letter and questionnaire were prepared and sent out to about fifty Nebraska women. The questionnaire was as follows: Questionnaire 1. What part of this year's program did you enjoy most? 2. What numbers on the speaking program appealed to you most"! Why ? ■ ' 3. What subjects do you wish to have stressed in our 1928 pro - gram? (Please designate 1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice.) A.

            <seg id="p356">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAIiD OF AGRICULTURE Many of them wrote beautiful, whole-souled letters and sent them with the questionnaire. These were certainly appreciated by your president. Next the questionnaires were checked and it was found that a majority of tho women checked the topic, "The Homemaker Herself." Many said in their letters that we had stressed the farm-home, the pre-school child, the grade-school child, and the last year the ado - lescent child, and now let us take an inventory of the Homemaker her - self. -\. The second choice was Civics or Citizenship and Nebraska Laws. Child Behavior and Round Table Discussions were other subjects that many wanted to have stressed. One day in October the committee was called together to work out a program for Organized Agriculture. It was one of those rainy, gloomy days when you want to sit around the fire and read and think. This is the substance of some of the thinking. — The Homemaker Herself Her Appearance Feeling 1007c fit Saving Her Time and Energy Her Life with Her Children Civic Responsibilities "The Homemaker at Her Best" was finally chosen as the theme of the 192S program. Then the hardest task of all came, who would the speakers be? Who could handle the subject in an interesting and worth while way? I'm not going to tell you another thing about this program but let you judge for yourself, but we want you to know that the homemakers of Nebraska, through their splendid letters and checking the question - naire have had a large part in determining what should go into the program for 1928. For several months I have been thinking, What is an ideal home - maker? What things go to make up an efficient homemaker? When is a homemaker a success? The last national census list us, the home - maker, under those with no occupation. In the first place she must be doing a good job in her individual home. She must so order her life that she is contributing in the highest measure to the health of her family. The homemaker is the engineer of her family and health comes first in a successful life. </seg>
            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION She must so order her life that the members of the family find mental stimulus in the home. In her, the husband should find mental companionship. Properly raised children should go into the world with a broad outlook. The wife and mother should be a real force in directing the thinking of the family. There must be a fine spiritual tone in the home, making possible the building of strong character; that the mem - bers of the family will do their share toward the building and main- • taming high principles and. standards. She must so plan her home that her sons and daughters will be able -to fit into whatever group they may later join; that they may realize their responsibilities to these groups' and make their contribu - tions to them; that they will become actively participating citizens. She will send into the world, men and women who are developed physically, who are alert mentally, and who are well balanced spiritually, who have a sense of their responsibility toward the group. Sometime ago, in one of our rural clubs, we conducted a round table discussion on "What goes to make a successful homemaker? What dees it take to make a farm woman a success?" These are some of the points brought out in that discussion. . First of all, she must have a desire for something better Then she must have vision, foresight, stability, "levelheadedness" and plenty of good common sense. She must not be afraid to work but her work need not be money making directly. All the women said "a working partner". The woman who does her own sewing and saves the expense of ready made garments, the woman who buys her material wisely, the woman who does home canning to cut the cost of the grocery bills, is making money. Indirectly, it is true, for "a dollar saved is a dollar earned". The Homemaker must know how to manage so as to make her work count and not allow it to become drudgery. If she has a family she must know how to care for them physically, mentally, and ' spiritually, in a wise, understanding, and sympathetic way. This in - cludes keeping- posted on hygiene, on methods of teaching and on what is going on in the world, besides knowing how to teach them the great spiritual truths of life. She may not be able to sing or play but she must know how to dress well. I don't mean keeping up with the latest fads or paying extravagant prices, but knowing- how to choose what is best suited to her affairs. She must know how to take an in - telligent part in community affairs and be able to assume leadership if necessary. I ' She must know, the school,' the church, the recreation of the com - munity. Making the community attractive and the efficient conduct of </seg>
            <seg id="p358">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE public affairs in the community are her responsibility as well as the care and ordering of her household. Furthermore, the true homemaker takes her share of responsibility in the life of her community, but must not sacrifice her family in so doing. These are high standards, of course, but we are judging the finest and the most important job in the whole world. But they are not too high, nor are they higher than the standards that hundreds of women are reaching in their farm homes today. And what is all this talk about the successful homemaker? It all reflects right back to the home. C. B. Smith, of the U. S. Depart - ment of Agricuture, in a paper given at the National Country Life Conference held at East Lansing, Michigan, says: "Of first importance in the home is good living. The farm family that furnishes the food for the nation should itself have first choice. A good table contributes greatly to the contentment of the family. The farmer may have that good table not as a, result of an increased in - come but as a result of a little better planning and a little more work. Fruit and vegetables, meat and milk, honey and flowers, should be a part of every farmer's table. The meal is the social event of the day in the farmer's family. It is a time when all the group are together. A plenteous and graceful meal begets happiness and conversation. It is the forerunner of hospitality, the finest grace of the rural home The stranger or neighbor is invited to stay for dinner. His coming enlivens the conversation of the family. New ideas are presented, new suggestions made. Intellectual stimulus follows. The satisfaction of exhibiting the commendable things of the farm and home are experi - enced. Hospitality extended invites hospitality in return, and so the fanner and his family go more— as result see more. The following poem gives many of the little things a homemaker does and yet each are a joy to us. LITTLE THINGS How I love the little things That every daily cycle brings. .The morning song of the coffee pot; The sizzle of bacon smoking hot. The half hour spent with the daily press Before the children awake and dress. The washing of faces and restless hands; Tying ribbons and buttoning bands. The gleam of silver, the shimmer of delft; A cup of tea from the pantry shelf. </seg>
            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The busy music of dish and spoon; The hurry and flurry of odorous noon. A neighbor's greeting across the fence; A dollar saved on the week's expense. .A merry call and a slamming door, And, "Mother, I'm home, it's half past four." The snowy table, the berries red; The evening lamp lit over-head. Some boisterous kisses at eight o'clock; A quite hour with a book or sock. The "Good night, dear," o f the one loved best; The long sweet hours of well earned rest. And When Lord Death has loosed my bond, And I slip into the great beyond, : My hope is not for jcrown and wings, But just for homeljl little things. . ' ■ :•:; . • ' I ' . ■ :■ : . "THE HOMEMAKER APPEARING HER BEST" Mrs. Howard Gramlich First, I want; to suggest that our meeting next year be devoted to husbands and fathers for theyhave a large part in every home. A mother's chief job is mothering, and that in itself is no small task. Since I gave that talk some time ago on time schedules, I have been trying to decide which are the "must do's" "need to do's" and 'may be doneV. Mrs. Dewey once said that all of her work was done before she came to a meeting. The person to whom she was talking replied, "If all my work! was done first, I would not be here." There should be more intimate companionship of parents with each other and parents with their children. Most of us set a bad example of being away from home too much— mother at her clubs and social affairs and father at his clubs. I am wondering what I shall do when my three year old daughter is old enough to belong to Camp - fire Girls clubs, Girl Reserves club, etc., in order tor give her enough contact with outside activities and still have her spend the proper amount of time in home entertainment. Too much recreation is • found outside of the home, instead of being provided within the home, under the supervision of the parents. Because of the many labor saving devices in the home, the mother should have more time to de- </seg>
            <seg id="p360">(KPORT Or .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE vote to her family, having- picnics and outings with them and visiting 1 the children's school? Are we not devoting that time to more church affairs, clubs affairs and things of that kind? I have a nr-ighbor who has three children and to me their home life is almost ideal. Veiy often they declare "Daddy's Day'' and on . that day the children %o with their daddy for an outing, perhaps a luncheon at tiv. 1 chamber of commerce, or to a good movie in the after - noon, or if in th&lt; M):i;iL or . umn.cr time, on an outing into the country. In thc.-amu wa\ ' i&lt; y have "Mother's Day" and "Family Day." The children show thf effect of this close companionship in their affection for each other. There is too much restlessness in our modern- homes. Both the auto and the radio contribute to this. We are not satisfied with hearing K. F. A. B. over our radio, but want to hear New York or some other far away place. Mothers should make provision for a little more leisure time. Be - cause of the many routine duties of the home life, it is said that a married woman loses the power of concentration. I have made a New Year resolution to set aside a few minutes each day for some mental work, alone. There is an article on this subject in the October number of Good Housekeeping. It suggests that a mother take time each day and exclude herself from all thought of family and use this time for her mental development with a book or magazine. She should have good reference books and become interested in a certain subject. In crease the length of the reading period each day, and if at the end of thirty minutes you are able to concentrate with no more than five wanderings of the mind you have developed the power of concentration. Miss Nelly Don who designs dresses that we are all familiar with, has written an article in the American Magazine. She says, "It is all right to be a wife, but don't look like one". She started life poor and with no conveniences, but she determined not to assume a dowdy appearance. Thus she conceived the idea of making- house dresses that look brijrht and cheery. I believe that we should* wear clothes that are bright. This is not vanity, but common sense. A slouchy appearing ' woman gets on ihe nerves of a man and really it reacts on herself. A mother's appearance also has its effect on her children. The children like to sec their mother look pretty. We like to be proud of our chil - dren and we should like to have them proud of us. When we are not clean and looking our best, it causes us to have a sense of depression, tho we sometimes do not realize it. Among other things, I think that bobbed hair is a means of dressing quicker and easier. In summing up, I should say that we mothers need to take more time for recreation, more time for play, more time for mental con - centration and more time for refreshing ourselves in the outdoor air. </seg>
            <seg id="p361">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' Marriage is in itself a career that entails the same chances of suc - cess or failure as any other career that we might have chosen, and let us all join together to make marriage not the end of life, but the beginning. "The Homemaker and the Press" was discussed briefly by: Miss Clementine Paddleford, Farm and Fireside Mrs. Julia Kiene, Capper's Farmer Mrs. Florence McReynolds Williams, Nebraska Farmer Miss Paddleford told the women what meetings of this kind meant to her. How it is the means of her knowing the type of things in which rural women are interested, and how she then attempts to give related material in her paper which will help the homemakers in their homes. She told the women of the library of materials which they have in leaflet form which is available for them if they care for it. Mrs. Kiene told the audience how she used the Extension program as one means of a guide for her material in her paper. She says that the home magazine is another unit to help the women with their home program. Mrs. Williams said that thru their paper they attempted to tell what some women were doing which had proven helpful to them. Mrs. i Williams said this gives you a chance .to check up on yourself to see if you are using these ideas and if not, possibly they will be of help to the reader. She said their aim is that these suggestions will help the woman of tomorrow to be better homemakers. ';■ . Miss Ruth Staples of the Home Economics Department was ill I and not able to take her place on the program. "The Homemaker and ' Her Children" which she was to discuss was given by Mrs. Eva Morse 1 of Omaha. "THE HOMEMAKER AND HER CHILDREN" . MRS. EVA MORSE The father is quite as much the homemaker as the mother. At 1 one time after speaking to a meeting of homemakers a woman came to me and said she was having trouble with her fourteen year old girl i who seemed to have gotten beyond her control and she wanted to know if I had any suggestions to give. I asked her if she and her husband had talked the matter over and she seemed very much sur - prised and she said that she never talked those matters over with her . husband as they did not agree on matters pertaining to the children. . . She said, "Well, now, I don't know that I had thought of it before, but ' when Nancy was little her father started to correct her and I grabbed . ■ . ■ ■ • 3: ■ :■■■ - ..__■„... ■•. ~-' : - -.'■"" ' ' </seg>
            <seg id="p362">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE her up and said, "Don't you dare touch my child". Instead of saying, "Father, what shall we do?", we say "my child". Father is quite as much interested in the child as mother is. What should the homemaker stand for in the home and what should she do for the children? First, the home should give the chil - dren the foundation of health. They may destroy it later in life, but they have a right to start out with it. Second, an understanding of sex. This is of great importance and especially to good health. Third, the ability to adapt themselves to living. Volumes have been written on each subject. Under the topic of health comes sleep, food and elimination. All these things are under our control as mothers. When the neighbor chil - dren stay up at nights it is hard to convince our children that it is neces- . sary for them to have an early bedtime hour. The amount of sleep required by human beings differs according to age, but children netd a great deal of sleep and very few get the proper amount. The child grows most during the hours that he is asleep. A mother once told me she didn't know what to do with her children, because they were so irritable when they got up in the morning. I suggested that her chil-' dren were cross because they were getting to bed at eight in the evening instead of seven o'clock. She tried putting them to bed . at seven and in a week her children were not getting up cross. Sleeping late in the morning is not as good as getting to sleep early in the evening. It may be all right for adults, but it is not the best way for children. The pre-school child is allowed to sit up at night to see daddy. At kindergarten age, he must be at school at 8:30 or 9:00 and therefore, cannot sleep in the morning as he used to do. This . breaks his habit of morning rest, but he still continues staying. up late at night. Thus the rhythm of sleep has been broken. Sleep during the dark* hours is a normal thing for the child, after the bright day, and the morning sleep does not take the place of it. There should be no association in the child's mind with bed, ex - cepting sleep. It is a mistake to have a child's bed in his play room, because his interest would be aroused with his play things. This was demonstrated by a woman who tried to take her afternoon nap in her sewing room. Her mind kept wandering to a bit of sewing that she very much wanted to do and sleep was chased away. The child's association with his room should be one of quietness and cleanliness. I am very much opposed to sending children to bed as punishment. It gives the child the wrong impression of the meaning of bed. I am not in favor of bed time stories unless one bad feature of this can be overcome. After one story is told, the child asks for </seg>
            <seg id="p363">Nebraska home economics association another and another and so a half hour soon passes, that should be spent in sleep. Then often a chapter ends at an interesting point and the child begs to hear more until time passes all out of proportion to what a bed time story should be. A bed time story should be very short, restful and fitting to repose. Fresh air is very necessary to sleep, whether it be cold or hot. A peaceful mental condition is also necessary. We should see that the children are not too much excited before going to sleep. Food is equally important. In late years the school has done a ' wonderful piece of work in cooperating with homes to get children to eat proper food.- A woman who was the mother of several children once said, "It is so hard to keep my family filled up". This is not just the question. .The human body is made up of certain things that it must have. When I was a girl I was visiting a friend and her mother had to leave before luncheon and she told us we might have' anything for luncheon we wanted. As strawberries were in season we decided to make a shortcake when it was done the pan was full of something, but it Tiad a greenish cast. When the mother returned we discovered, we had used washing soda instead of baking powder. This incident illustrates the fact that it takes certain things to make the right kind of a shortcake and it takes certain kinds of food to make a right functioning human body. One day my father decided to oil and clean the family clock, .but when he put it together afterward, he found he had one more wheel than he could use. When the clock was put up again it looked all right, but it did not work right. When we are not getting the right kind of food, the human body may look all right, but it does not work right. We forget that we must have milk, vegetables and fruit every day and we should not plan a meal without these. The calcium helps to make the blood coagulate and make muscles and nerves. Sunshine is vitally necessary for the proper growth of children. If you will raise a stick from the lawn in early spring the grass underneath is a yellow cast, showing what lack of sunlight has done. The same thing , is true in children. Nebraska does not have enough sunlight in the winter time especially and a substitute of cod liver oil should be given children during the period. This oil is taken from the cod that lives deep in the ocean, but comes up to the surface of the water and stores up sunshine in the form of oil, to be used during the period which it passes in darkness. I ■- ' ■ ; ' • ■ . I consider it very necessary that all conversation during meal times should be of a happy type. . I once knew a family who were all dyspeptics.

When this matter was corrected, there was no more trouble with dyspepsia. The matter of elimination is a very vital one. Regularity is the keynote for success in this. Cooked bran should be eaten freely and large amounts of water used. No one can be at their best when there is improper elimination, and depression is often the result. It is possible to encourage regular habits of elimination. At noon the County Home Demonstration chairmen met for a luncheon at which time they held a round table discussion. TUESDAY AFTERNOON The afternoon session opened with Miss Margaret Fedde presiding. She first introduced Mr. Oscar Bennett, of the Voice Department, Ne - braska Wesleyan University, who had charge of the music which was given at the opening of each meeting. In introducing Mr. Bennett, Miss Fedde told how Mrs. Carrie B. Raymond, deceased, had charge of " the music for the past number of years. Her selection of musicians was always greatly appreciated and the memory of this association with Mrs. Raymond will always be remembered. Miss Fedde said that Mr. Bennett was one of the musicians that Mrs. Raymond so often brought to the meetings and that it is a pleasure to have him in charge of the music for this program. Mr. Bennett with Mrs. Ben - nett accompanying on the piano, sang the following: Gipsy John — by Clay Lilies of Lorraine — by Connor The Lane Dog — by Homer "CAN THE HOMEMATCER FEEL 100% FIT" MISS CLARA RAUSCH This week marks the beginning of a new year. Everyone has started in making new resolutions. When we meet our friends on the street we say we wish you happiness and health for the coming year. To me, I think I can sum up all of these resolutions and all the dif - ferent things that people say to me in that they wish me health. What do we mean by health ? Do we mean physically fit, having good teeth, good digestion, strong muscles? That is not all that makes good health. In fact these are only a small part of what good health is. Good health is radiated from the person who has it so that all the people around know that that person has good health. Good health means more than free from disease for health is endurance and energy and ability to do what ever one wishes. Free from disease is probably one </seg>
            <seg id="p365">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' of the. best parts and has a great deal to do with good health. Emerson said! that 90% of the people who go to see the doctor could control their own ills by themselves if they only had the will power and the scope of their own knowledge. Statistics of the college girls in the University of Nebraska give us interesting facts. During the 1926-27 semester in the physical education department we had over 1428 girls ar.d in that group 330 or over 23% were physically unfit to do even" the simplest form of gymnastic work required by the University. That is, they were unable to do setting up exercises, exercises to help to build the body better than it, was before. Those girls could not play tennis, hockey or do horse back riding because sometime somewhere someone had failed along the line to make them 100% fit. A girl who has probably a defective heart is not able to run, play hockey, etc. She gets her exercise by laying down on her back and moving her arms and i legs. In 1927-28, first semester, we have enrolled in our classes 1551 girls and of that number we have 245 who are doing individual gymnastics. There is one reason for this drop from other years be - cause before last year we had no facilities for taking care of these girls. They formerly got a reprieve. That is, they had no instruc - tion and consequently they got out of it altogether. They were the ones who really needed the instruction, more than the others who did receive the instruction. At the bottom of this loss in life energy and happiness is the ignorance ofl the body and its care. You would be surprised to know the number of girls who know nothing about the laws of hygiene. They do not know anything about taking care of the body. They know nothing of anatomy, physiology. These girls are now getting a great deal out of this sort of thing. The first requisite then in being 100% efficient is knowledge of the human machine and its workings in order that we may control or limit the 90% of stallings or breakdowns we now tow off to the doctors. ■ The 10% whom Emerson did not mention are the ones whom the doctors cannot do anything for. The other 90% who can help themselves are the ones we should be interested in right now. You will- find papers, magazines and books everywhere that deal with all types of information concerning the . neglect and indiscretions of diet, exercise and rest. Some of it is very good, some questionable and being guided in the right way we can pick' out | a good deal of. useful information and profit by it One of the best magazines on the market is Hygeia. One of the worst is Physical Culture. ... j There are several reasons why we are inefficient. The first reason is lack of knowledge. That is we do not know or understand the struc - ture ■ of the body and the workings of each part of the machinery. Careful construction is necessary in every part of. the machinery and it must be properly set up, otherwise it will run with friction and waste. The human body is very often poorly built not because «f the fault of </seg>
            <seg id="p366">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the architect but thru igonrance and carelessness of contractor, builder !■' and owner. An inefficient product results and less than 100% ef - ficiency in the works results. The second reason why we are inefficient is that the body is constructed too light or too heavy. Life Insurance Companies have made tabulations which show that the mortality is lowest among those ranging 15 to 20% over weight from the ages of 20 to 34. From the ages of 35 to 49 the lowest death rate is among those from 5 to 10% underweight. What are the causes of under - weight? First, is it the kind of food, or faulty nutrition? Over work, too long hours, worry and too little rest are also causes of under - weight. In this age we probably have a little more time to rest, and '■ I wonder how many of us know how to rest to relax. In my &gt;■ classes I teach the girls how to relax. After several attempts they learn to relax in a few minutes and drop off to sleep. A result of under weight is poor posture. The body lacks packing, support and protection j to the organs which is supplied by the normal amount of fat. Such ' persons are nervous, tense, have little endurance, tire easily and worry a great deal. On the other hand the persons who are over weight - are slow, sluggish and don't care to move. Their elimination and metabolism is deficient Such machines lack power and will not run up hill very far unless they have an unusual engine and unusual strength. The third reason why we are less than 100% efficient is muscular weakness. Forty-one percent of the body is made of muscular tissue. Well balanced and well controlled muscles are needed rather than large and big muscles, altho the latter are an asset in moving heavy objects. Well balanced, controlled and developed muscles are necessary to make all muscles work to the greatest advantage. Other things being equal the less muscle strength, the greater the drain on the nerve force. It is extremely important that we have strength of trunk mus - cles, that is, the back, abdominal and side muscles. A person is as strong as the weakest spot in the back. Persons with weak backs usually complain of tense necks and soreness thru their shoulders, weak abdominal muscles give insufficient sunport to the large abdominal organs. These organs fall out of place and faulty digestion is the result. Relaxation and stretching of the abdominal wall causes sagging and displacement of abdominal organs, and results in constipation, indigestion, headache, backache and a feeling of unfitness, such as just dragging themselves around. Muscles as a whole are untrained and lack coordination. Thinking and movements are related. Such as, if n "Tson moves slowly, he acts deliberately: moves quickly, he thinks quickly and is equal to emergencies. If he moves heavily he is more or J less relaxed physically and thinks ponderously. If ho has jerky agitated movements he is inclined to be nervous and unpoised. If he is careless in his movements he is apt to be careless in his thinking. ' </seg>
            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The fourth defect which keeps us from being 100% efficient is a poor chest. For most people breathing is little more than raising the chest up and down by neck muscles. This type results in a rigid chest, diaphragm used but little, sluggish circulation, congestion of lungs, prominent collar bone, and scrawny neck. The body must have sufficient amount of air, otherwise its efficiency is lowered. We can compare the body to the automobile with an insufficient combustion chamber, which is stalled in the road and is unable to move. If the gas is not used up, eventually the engine will not run as it should. A good developed chest gives you endurance and vitality. The type of breathing is closely related to the mental . state, such as if a person is frightened he catches his breath, if sad, he sighs; if agitated, the breathing is jerky and rapid, if he is calm and happy, the breathing : is slow and deep. : Deep breathing helps the mental state. The fifth reason for inefficiency is flat feet. The examination of College girls shows that more than 10% of the girls have flat feet, and a higher percent with foot troubles of some sort. It was found thru the draft, that of the number enlisted, 176,000 men were suffering ' from flat feet. Four thousand were injured in one year from accidents due to high heels. The American Museum of. Safety states over 90% of- the people have feet more or less deformed from wearing im - properly fitting shoes. Shoes lead to all other foot troubles. They cause toeing out, the toes are crowded, and the great toe is forced into unnatural position. Shoes are often incorrectly designed, they are stiff' or too short and limit the action of the muscles and cause them to lose their elasticity and tone' and .become a hindrance in walking.. Another painful condition is the falling of the anterior arch. It is the small arch across the foot where the toes are joined to the foot itself. The bones are thin and very fine, and very often these give way, be - come flattened out and intense pain is the result. First warning is pain in the 3 outer toes and directly under the ball of the foot. The pain is so intense that the shoe must be removed and foot manipulated so the bones are adjusted and pressure on nerves relieved. The con - dition is again caused by poorly shaped shoes, especially those too short or with high heels and pointed toes. High heels push the feet forward into the toe of the shoes and a cramped condition follows. The toes are held in such jl manner that spreading and flattening is further aggravated. Most foot troubles come from improper use of feet in standing and walking. In walking the toes should be pointed straight ahead. Another cause of flat feet is just plain muscular weakness of the whole body. One of the worst things a woman can do is wearing party shoes around the house. These shoes are designed to wear only one or two hours at a time and not designed to wear from morning until night. All this effects the efficiency of the person in work and pleasure. The crop sown by tight and badly fitting shoes brings an </seg>
            <seg id="p368">tKi'OKT I IK VIOBIi.ASKA STATE BOAKU OK AGRICULTURE abundant harvest, callouses, corns and bunions are minor ailments com - pared with fallen arches. Nature pays us back as we pay her. Squeeze your feet ami she makes them bigger by flattening arches and enlarging the joints. The sixth reason for inefficiency is poor posture, or the machine is poorly set up. The .statistics that we have on the University girls show that out of 217 girls, about 10 girls or 4.67o have perfect posture, who stand up well. There are 70 girls who have B posture, 92 who have C posture ami 25 who have D posture. Posture expresses person - ality and also th. profit am! pleasure we got out of life. People used to value posture merely as a thing of beauty but today we know it has definite value in hygienic, economic, social and esthetic lines and is an asset of ijreat importance. In the hygienic value, we know the organ;: are put together like the parts of a machine. If shifted thru improper carriage they fail to work in an efficient way and results in waste of wrrv and strength, and fatigue comes early in the day. In the social value, good posture reacts upon the individual as to give him an increase of self respect and confidence of ability to present a good appearance and power to look the world in the eye. Posture expresses mental statis. Emerson said "What you are speaks so loud, I can't hear what you say". It is true that assuming a cer - tain attitude that expresses a certain emotion tends to produce that emotion. In the esthetic value, from the viewpoint of appearance, good posture is important. An erect bearing is more pleasing to the eye than a slouchy bearing. Clothes show more graceful 1 lines and appear to greater advantage on a figure held with dignity. An alert, well set I up individual is noticed at once and an involuntary tribute paid to the value of posture. j When we say, "How well that person carries herself", in the economic way, posture has strong value. The standing and sitting posture assumed by employees effects their efficiency and by making them comfortable their output is increased. For the homemaker, she can increase her efficiency by having her stool the right height, im - prove the height of her ironing board, wash tubs, have brooms, mops hung on nails to avoid stooping over. It is a better practice to have things high rather than low so as to get stretching exercise. A recent applicant walked herself out of a good position in eight sit-jjo. The Director of a well known private school asked to see candi- ' dates for the position. The first one was rejected before she spoke a word to them. ' </seg>
            <seg id="p369">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION When we analyze posture from the standpoint of health and character and not merely as indicative of the prevailing fashion, it is 1 a rather indifferent person who is willing to continue publishing her deficiencies to the • world thru posture and carriage. What can we do about it? What chance has a busy housewife who thinks she hasn't time for exercise nor for making delinite and specific attempts at correction ? In the first place v/alcii your weight. Weigh yourself at least once a week. Eat noui-ishiny food, neither too much or too little. If underweight, get all sleep, rest and relaxation you can. Avoid worry and excitement. If overweight, be careful of diet and follow out a systematic program of exercise for reducing. Walk as much as you can. Remember the old adage — a lean horse for a long race. Second — increase your strength. Best method and most successful way to do this is to find out where your special weaknesses are and get suggestions as to the specific type of exercises. Have a good thoro physical examination once a; year by a reliable doctor. Avoid quacks. In the third place, pay attention to your chest. The place to start correction ■ of the chest is by strengthening the back that supports it and the abdomen that must be strong enough to prevent a downward pull on the chest. ; In practicing expansion it must be done laterally and the diaphram brought strongly into play. Stand before a mirror and watch that your chest is not lifted by the neck muscles. But most important of all think about breathing deeply especially when out of doors. Be sure your shoes are correct. The same shoe does not fit every foot but all good [shoes have straight inner borders and low heels. Point toes straight ahead while walking and carry weight on outer border of foot. If feet are in a bad condition they need some special exercises. - . • High heels have long been a source of argument. Some say they must wear high heels to be comfortable yet high heels are undoubtedly responsible for many sore feet, aching backs and touchy tempers. If nature had planned for our heels to be lifted from % to 3 inches off the ground, she would have built our feet that way in the first place. Do not transform your foot into a hoof by wearing pointed toe shoes with high heels. Do not wear short stockings. Be sure they are long enough so there will be no constriction of the toes. Stand with the arches drawn up and weight on outer borders of the feet. This strengthens the foot and prevents rolling in. Treat your feet kindly. Remember that " a soldier on the march is no better than his feet." For good posture strengthen muscles of the trunk, stand and sit as • tall as possible. Walk with abdomen drawn in. Pull the chin back and </seg>
            <seg id="p370">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in stretching up from the top of the head separate the shoulders from the hips as far as possible. Train this muscle sense of good posture before your mirror. To do this be sure the weight is well balanced over the arch of the feet. From the feet lift the body in a straight line. Hold the chest high, not out, the hips should be under the trunk, not tilted forward or sprung behind. Arms should hang naturally at side. When sitting, sit far back in chair, do not slide down and Tforward in chair. Feet should rest comfortably on floor. Lean forward from hips and don't collapse at waist. In selecting cloth - ing be sure nothing binds nor constricts. Straps should fit close to neck and not sag down over tips of shoulders. Most of these defects mentioned may be corrected with little time and effort. One thing absolutely necessary for their correction is that . you interest yourself in testing them out. With the interest and will to correct them you will find opportunity a dozen times a diy for think - ing and doing simple constructive and corrective things that will in a few months bring such satisfying results that never again will you need to be convinced of the importance of a sound and controlled body and the possibility of its increasing your success and happiness. The talk "Memnnes from Twenty-Two years of These Meetings" was given by Mis. L. W. Wilkens and Mrs. E. A. Burnett. Before in - troducing these speakers Miss Fedde asked for those in the audience who were at the meeting 23 years ago to stand. The following people stood up: Mrs. E. A. Burnett, Lincoln Mrs. L. W. Wilkens, Lincoln, (formerly of DeWitt) Mrs. J. D. Ream, Broken Bow Mrs. J. C. Pentzer, 1924 No. 27th, Lincoln Mrs. Pheobe Gregg, College View Miss Fedde in introducing Mrs. Wilkens who spoke first of the earlier meetings, mentioned that she is the mother of the president of the organization and that Mrs. Berger was one of the children who was left at home to be cared for by Mr. Wilkens when Mrs. Wilkens came to these first meetings. MEMORIES FROM 22 YEARS MRS. L. W. WILKENS When Miss Rosa Bouton, chairman of the Home Economics De - partment and vice-president of the Home Economics Section of Or - ganized Agriculture, wrote me a card and invited me to come to the meetings of Organized Agriculture in 1909, I was very happy.

To leave one's family of small children for nearly a week is not so easy I immediately devised a way to put husband and children in a good humor so that they might not miss me too much. I filled a four gallon cookie jar full of white cookies, another one with brown nut cookies, also baked a long fruit cake -and roasted a ham, and then . proceeded to get ready. We had to take a very early train from DeWitt and had to have the breakfast over and the children ready for school before going away. The dedication of the new pome Economics Building was that year of 1909. Mrs. Ellen Richards came to Nebraska fro-.n Massachu - setts in honor of the dedication. Our new Home Economics Building had not been equipped with many of the beautiful furnishings it now has. The tables in the dining room were beautifully laid with white table cloths and at each table were a host and hostess. Another in - teresting feature that I remember is that the blessing was said before eating. The food was so good that the most critical epicure could relish it. That year we had a very interesting session and a large attendance. Among other things Mrs. Richards told us that we should educate our store keepers to supply our wants according to our wishes, our neces - sities and our purses. From those meetings we took a great many new ideas home with us. In the following year of 1910 a very heavy snow fallen on a soft road bed and all odds were against my going to the meetings. But I was not to be daunted, and with the help of a boy to carry my suit - case, we walked three milos down the railroad track and reached the depot in time for the train. The road was in such bad condition that the horses could not be taken out. At that time I remember the morn - ing meal was late. The storm had caused everything to be at 6's and 7's and. it looked as if I would not get to so. But finally my husband said to me, "You go, &amp;nd I will take care of things." So he sat down on a chair by the stove to stir the mush and read his book. At the same time I made my escape, hoping that I too would find an easier way to work. i In my early married life I learned that in order to be successful, T had to be equal to the occasion and to be able to attend these meetings each year since 1909, I had to plan before hand and devise ways and means. There were times when the early settlers did not j. know whether the dollar was round or square for we saw so "few of them. But we made away to go. After we arrived at the College of </seg>
            <seg id="p372">FtEPOKT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Agriculture we were met by a warm welcome and the genial smile with which we were greeted by Mrs. Dean Burnett shall never be for - go'ten. 1L? first recollections I have of anything approaching Home Economics was the time when Mr. and Mrs. G. A. Gregory of Crete, Nebraska, introduced the Crete Plan. According to their plan, the peo - ple of Crete openr^l their homes to give lessons on foods and cooking to the girls of the schools. The Crete meetings were a grand success. Once a year they held general meetings for any of the people of the county who wished to come. These meetings I attended four years. The plan was u&lt;~d in many parts of our country and was even carried to Europe, u was abandoned only when the Home Economics school was fully established at the College of Agriculture. I assure you the citizens oi Crete and the surrounding country availed themselves of these meetings, which were a step in interesting the people in an insti - tution as we have here. About 1914 Mrs. Whitmore of Valley intro - duced to us a home made tireless cooker made by herself. Ami so down the years from 1909 to 1928 it has been my privilege to attend, year oy year, these meetings of Organized Agriculture, which have grown bigger and better every year, and here farm folk from ever&gt; part of the state come to talk over many problems. Inspiration, recreation and education were afforded by these meet - ings. Thru all these years we have had excellent speakiArs present stilling messages and discussions and they have been full of interest for tvery one who attended. The many good things we have found in store for us here at Organized Agriculture have helped to inspire and refresh us. Thru all these years we have studied Home Management problems, Citizenship, care and rearing of children. Last year thru the splendid talks of Dr. Hedger, we were able to study the adolescent ch,U. We are living in an age when people are inclined to do things, not individually and alone, but together, thru the medium of organization. Our homes can receive no better stimulant than that which is given by ' the Home Economics Department to the individual. It is the business o{ our Home Economics Department to furnish a constant, intelligent, up to date, and forward looking program to our homemakers.

REMINISCENCES MRS. E. A. BURNETT From the many memories of twenty and more years of these meetings, it is difficult to choose for a ten minute talk personalities and interests which should all be included. When Miss Rosa Bouton, • then head of all there was of the Home Economics Department, called on me one morning in that long ago and suggested that the wives accompanying their husbands to the meetings of Organized Agri - culture might be interested in some organization especially for them, she probably had little idea how far the candle thus lighted would throw its beams. It was in the days of women's auxiliaries, of farmer's institutes. The women from these auxiliaries and other rural leaders such as Mrs. W. F. Johnson, Wilkens, Apperson, Reams, were from the first our heartiest supporters. The list is long of earnest minded and public spirited women who have been the inspiration of these meet - ings both of those who gave and those who carried away helpful mes - sages to their own groups. Mrs. Wilkens has already told you of rome of the difficulties .women overcame, to attend these meetings. In the membership list of twenty years ago are some who still come to this annual meeting. Among these is the first president of this organi - zation, Mrs. Whitemore, then of Valley, wife of Regent Wnitemore and mother of eight active and interesting children. She kept no maid, never had a doctor in the faniily and her household machinery seemed , always oiled with the spirit o|f love and good fellowship. There was time in that home for reading aloud and for hon?e entertainments. i Time also she somehow found to be a leading spirit in the community mothers club. Cooperation was a real thing in that home, even tho , baby had a part in it, when floor waxing was made a game among the children and the- baby seated on a rug or something was laughingly scooted from one side of the floor to the other in the polishing process. (That baby is now one of the popular young society women of Lincoln.) There were no automobiles or radios and few telephones to take away the isolation of rural homes so there was much more discussion then than now of ways to relieve the monotony for farmers' wives and 1 their children. The traveling , library, good books for the homes, get - ting together in study .clubs,| besides the fundamental industries of cooking and sewing were the i leading topics in these early meetings. The coming of Mrs. Ellen H. Richards in 1909 meant much to us. j-j • In 1912-13 Mrs. Harry Keefe of Walthill was president of the associ - ■ ation, living and being, active, like Mrs. Whitmore, in a rural com- I </seg>
            <seg id="p374">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE rrmnity herself and being also a leader in state club work and filled with a zeal for helpfulness, she extended the contacts with leading club women of the state and furthered the cooperation of town and farm women. In the meantime the Home Economics Department of the University had developed marvellously. It is responsible for the founding of the Woman's Section of Organized Agriculture and from that time to the present it has been the backbone of its working organization. Its efficient staff of teachers and extension workers together with for - ward-looking women of country and town have worked hard to make it the success it has always been. The Agricultural Extension women were coming more and more in touch with farm women and children, starting boys and girls clubs and clubs of various kinds looking to the betterment of living. Mrs. Davison for a number of years the head of the Home Demonstration work of the Extension Service, served as president here from 1914 to 1917. Her charming personality, her gift for friendships and finding excellence and worth while gifts among the groups she met thru the state helped tremendously to fill our as - sembly hall to overflowing with live, wide awake women at every session from Tuesday morning to Thursday afternoon. I have a vivid picture of every seat filled, solid lines around the walls and people perched in the windows. If the windows had to be thrown open frequently to let in a little sweeter air it didn't matter. Since then the growth in at - tendance has been continuous. Many things contributed to the importance ' of the rural work during these years of the terrible World War and the government was generous with its money for Extension. The power of women's clubs began to be felt and a closer cooperation with all workers in the state was felt to bernecessary. Miss Loomis, Miss Vance and others became war workjws as\vell as University workers. Mrs. Gramlich and Mrs. Burr succeeded M&gt;s. Davison. Some of the topics of those years, 1918-20, were Boy4 and Girls Club work, textiles, style shows, mar - keting, house management, art in the home, dietetics, better babies movement (fosteretf by Mrs. Vance) talks on patriotism, food substitu - tes, war time service, conservation and rural club reports which is always a most valuable part of the programs. These told of much community service. To Mrs. Davison must also be given the credit for discovering and bringing to us our next president, Mrs. Hudson. In remote district of Cherry county as Mrs. Hudson herself said, "Twenty-five miles from a bottle of ink or a spool of thread" where she had then lived twenty odd years, she was found doing inspiring service in a rural club. How much she has given to us in the later years I don't need to </seg>
            <seg id="p375">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION" remind any of you who have met her. We smile as we remember how diffident she at first was about speaking here and how fluent she proved as our president for two years. Her gracious personality and her bnlhant gifts, her wide reading and her, love of all nature her kinship with it, endear her to all who meet her and make her a very popular lady whenever she appears in Lincoln. Thru her and Mrs. Sheldon we have learned that Nebraska birds are an important contribution to the happiness of Nebraska homes. Thru Mrs. Hudson we are again impressed with, the fact that it is not where we live but how we live that matters. After war reactions appear in discussions of Opportunity schools, vocational education and thrift compaigns, etc. A list of topics from 1918 on reflects the still widening vision and contact of women's home with outside interests, the widening field of service connected with problems of general public interest. Laws pertaining to women by Mrs. H. H. Wheeler who has many times appeared on our programs, Mother's Pensions, the Smith-Towner Law, the League of Women Voters, Vocational Opportunities for Girls were other topics. To Miss Fedde now head of Home Economics Department, are we in - debted for our later good programs. She has told us of opportunities' open to girls in the various fields of medicine, finance, journalism, law, insurance, religious work, etc., besides the many phases of home economics work. There have been programs devoted to each stage of child and youth development. The contributions to health and hygiene given forcefully by Dr. Hodger, are fresh in our minds and now we are this week evidently gathering together to consider the Home Maker at Her Best. Personally, I have hosts of memories of the many delightful people these meetings have brought together, people who have contributed much to the cheer and wholesomeness of living. . In these 20 years we note especially the changing emphasis in ideals and the almost total wiping out of lines of differing interests be - tween rural women and town women. Perhaps there are some still who regret this. Dean Vivian of Ohio contributed among other good things this bit of sensible nonsense. . The farmer's wife in early days, got up at half past two, And shmed the plows and milked the cows and put the prunes to stew, And breakfast for the hands she'd set upon the stroke of four And then she'd bake the bread and cake and scrub the kitchen floor But now-a-days the farmer's wife has time to call her own Good gracious!" says the government, "How idle she has grown!" The farmer's wife in times gone by, brought up the calves and lambs, And sacked the oats- and fed the shoats and' smoked the hickory hams, And when she'd cooked three great big meals, she cheerfully arose, And with her churn, sat down to earn the money for her clothes.

For more than 30 years the National Congress of Parents iind Teachers has been studying and working for children, training parents, promoting cooperation between home and school, with steadily increas - ing success, if one may measure it by the growing numbers of men and women who are identifying themselves with this movement. As the years have brought experience in the methods best adapted to the attainment of the ideals of our honored founders, there has been a developing consciousness of the fact that in order to work together it is necessary that parents and teachers should be working on projects ■ which are of mutual interest, at one and the same time; and that since the professional program of the school can not be subject to adaptation to outside conditions, the program of the home and the community must have sufficient flexibility to meet the more fixed re - quirements of the rducational system. At the meeting of the National Education Association in Philadel - phia, in the summer of 1020, the splendid program offered by the then president Miss Mary McSkimmon, centered around the challenge of the child to the teachers of America, its framework being the summary of education which had been presented by the committee appointed two or three years ago to study the content of the curriculum in secondary schools and bring in recommendations for its possible improvement. That committee returned a report to the effect that if education were to exercise its fullest function of fitting a child both for making a living and living a life, it should include seven great objectives: sound health; worthy home membership; vocational effectiveness; use of the tools and techniques of learning; the wise use of leisure; useful citizen - ship; ethical character; and it's further recommended that the school curriculum provide for the meeting of these requirements. What a challenge to parents lies in these recommendations, so simply made! In an address made before the General Assembly of the National Edu - cation Association thi., challenge was taken up on their behalf and the </seg>
            <seg id="p377">. NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' section meeting of the Congress held in connection with that conven - tion, was devoted to a consideration of the responsibility of the home to the childhood of America. But this subject was not merely one for discussion it demanded action, not by an individual but by a nation. On not one single point could the school be reasonably expected to carry out successfully its . splendid enterprise without the support and active cooperation of the home and the community as represented by parents and other citizens. Health taught for brief periods five (lays in the week during a school year varying from six to nine months in length and neglected thruout the balance of the 36'5 days would have little chance of per - manent establishment, and a health program delaying its inauguration until the first six years of fundamental health building is oi&gt;e which starts with an insuperable handicap. It is of little use for the school to train children to demonstrate the teachings that are not available to every child; yet we know that in a large proportion of the so-called "homes" the atmosphere is not conducive to the development of domes- • tic virtues nor are the examples set such as may be recommended for imitation. Ernest R. Groves of the University of North Carolina says, "We need conservation of the family -even more than conservation of the soil. The home will always disappoint those who attempt to extract from it pleasures inferior to proper gifts. It is folly to expect persons submerged in a materialism that robs them of all sense of values to enjoy good family life. The home can not perform miracles, it can not be better than the members that compose it. The unhappy home merely discloses the wrong way of living of those who belong to it. The worthy home contributes to the individual, to the family as - sociation and to society itself. To the individual it presents opportuni - ties of growth. One member does not develop at the expense of the other; husband, wife and children all grow in personality and in character. They also, each of them, achieve self-expression. The home is never primarily sacrifice, it is essentially achievement. The right home also teaches interpretation of true values. At the time when the desire for luxury has become universal, no home can prosper unless each member learns to discriminate in his choice of values. The home develops in its inner life an understanding of the dif- ■ ferences between people, and a. tolerance and sense of justice in deal - ing with one another difficult to obtain without family contacts. A good family also provides thru its association a comradeship of parents and children who, in spite of their differences in years, enjoy being with one another in the fellowship of affection. Out of this comes a loyalty of each toward the family as a whole which in these </seg>
            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE days gives i he family greater security than comes from the attempt to establish a home upon forceful authority and dominance. The good home encourages social sympathy and cooperation in relation to the life outside. It is never shut in. It is never harsh in judgment. It has concern for the welfare of neighborhood, community and nation. It is not content merely to feel right toward other people, it acts according to its opportunity because each member has learned the value of cooperation and has a sense of social obligation. If the bad family throws out into the life of a community every sort of evil influence, it is equally true that from the good home always must come everything that makes for social well being. Vocational training is the work of the expert, but the vocational effectiveness specified in the report we are considering is quite dif - ferent matter. Vocations are seldom followed under the conditions existing in the school nor always with the equipment there provided, and the test of the training is the facility with which adverse condi - tions are met and the acquired principles are applied in different en - vironment. Men and women in America may work with certain limitations, of course, at any vocation they choose to follow. There are no rigid caste lines, there are no social barriers which compel a child to follow in the footsteps of his forbears. Given energy, sufficient intelligence, and the opportunity for training, and there is no calling into which a man may not enter if he truly desires to do so. Here again is the genius of our national industrial life — there is no limit to which a child may not aspire, there is no height he may not reach, if he will but choose carefully and build wisely. As parents, I would have you recognize the importance of the parent - child relationship as it relates to the choice of a vocation. Ideally the best counselor of a child as to the life-work he should follow is the parent of that child. No one knows the child better than the wise parent, yet it is rare father or mother who is wise enough to counsel effectively with the boy or girl on this matter. That this is so is due largely to the limitations of our own education. How can we counsel concerning that of which we ourselves are ignorant? But there is no excuse for our remaining ignorant. There is always a rich and growing bibliography in this field. As individuals you can become intelligent' concerning vocations, their requirements, their limitations, their rewards, the training necessary, to the end that you may wisely counsel with your child concerning the choice which is second only to that of choosing a husband and wife. As parent-teacher associations you can form study groups on the problems of choosing a vocation, you can sponsor a vocational shelf in your city and high school libra-: </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ties, you can influence your high school principals and city superinten - dents to make adequate provision for an effective program of counseling as an integral part of the public schools. Be alive to the danger that you may unconsciously become the. dictator rather than the counselor concerning your child's future. Lay before him all that you can learn concerning those vocations in which he may be interested, but take not from him the privilege and respon - sibility for making the final choice. In regard to the tools and techniques of learning, the general public quite naturally feels that here surely is responsibility — if by this time it has been assumed — maybe shifted to the school — that these are matters for the educator and for him alone; but a moment's consider - ation will show that here too the burden rests almost wholly i\pon the citizen, for while the educator may administer more or less successfully, after all the tools and methods will be just as good or as bad as the public allows. The school must work within its incomes. The quality of the equipment and. the efficiency of the teaching depends upon the taxpayers who supplies the funds from which supplies and salaries are met. Mrs. Susan B. Dorsey, Supt. of Schools, Los Angeles, Calif., says, "The tools of learning maybe set down as Vhose studies which are most serviceable in facilitating intellectual understanding and social inter - course among men. What ever else the schools may, or may not, teach children, it is necessary for the self-respect of children, for their success in a vocation, for their own intellectual satisfaction and for their usefulness as citizens, that they be taught to read under - standingly, to do the single computations accurately, use language ac - ceptably, write legibly, and spell correctly. The mastery of the fundamentals will not of itself make an educated person. The schools ! have done only a small part of their work if the learning acquired there does not function in better, happier, and more useful lives, in better homes and communities, in a better nation and tetter world, for, after all, there can be no possible object in learning . just for learning's sake. It is the humanizing of knowl - edge, the making of it available for the purposes of life, that is the main objective. Every child has. a perfect right to ask, "What good is all this?" and the school is a .failure that can not satisfy with more than a formal answer. It must' give proof positive of the good that is, and will be, in every subject taught, and this is just what the schools of today are bound to accomplish, namely, to fit knowledge to the needs of the child and thru him to the needs of society. </seg>
            <seg id="p380">KKI'iiKT OK NEBRASKA STATIC HOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the wise use of leisure, again, we have a great opportunity, for the child who has acquired the habit of using his time to advantage will not bi tho problem child, of the social worker and the juvenile court. This important habit must be made as nearly automatic as pos - sible in tho pre-school years. It is the child who perpetually wails: ".Mother, what ean I do now?" who is the corner loafer or the side - walk flirt of later years. The boy or girl whose interests and abilities, however limited, are developed to be many and varied has better safe - guards than all the precepts and restrictions which anxious parents may employ. Uut the encouragement of a desire for expression in pre - ference to continuous impression must be supplemented by the means to that did, and here again we are faced by the demand for civic action in the provision of ample play space and opportunity for exercise in many sports, for the elimination of the vicious literature which is now scattered like poisonous weeds on the fertile soil of keen young minds and for a determined effort to secure some control over the type and quality of motion pictures exhibited in neighborhood theatres, a control now exercised entirely by the producing industry in its equally determined campaign to keep the market wide open for its output, regardless of anything but the box office returns. If united action on thii last line can be developed by the men and women of this organi - zation and those of several othnrs now equally aroused to the need for it, to a degree at all commensurate with that existing within the corporation controlling the films, a distinct improvement of the situ - ation may be confidently expected. In the field of recreation, the chief end is not land, structures, and facilities; legislative enactments; technique or departmental arrange - ment; iiicety in prrjnam emphasis and the professional dignity of the recreation workers, but thf&gt; health and happiness, physical fitness, moral integrity, and the citizenship of boys and girls, men and women, in every nook and cranny and in whatever station in life they may find themselves. In other words, leisure time facilities, opportunities, pro - gram and leadership must needs be of, by and for the people if desired ends are to be achieved. Ample provision and leadership should be made for physical plays, games, pastimes, and sports. "Everybody in the game and a game for everybody." Boys are forgetting how to play baseball in many cities because there is no place to play baseball, even the back lots are passing and modern transportation has made play in the street dangerous. Citizenship does not consist of the ability to sing the first verse of Star Spangled Banner, or the lifting of the hat an inch or two as the flag passes, not yet of the celebration of the birthdays of Washing - ton and Lincoln.

' NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION" in the promotion of the public welfare, and those who set the patterns . for this objective are not only the parents and teachers, who are looked upon by the rising generation as ex-officio compelled to preach certain doctrines, to teach specific observances, but are even more the average citizens, professional men or preachers, bankers or business men, policemen or railroad employees, going about their everyday con - cerns and showing by their methods of doing their work, what it is •that produces success or failure, and how they contribute to the pros - perity of their community. True liberty is not license but universal observance of law, and the goid citizen is one who both obeys and enforces it. Will C. Wood, State Superintendent of Banks, Calif., says, "If we would have better citizens in America, we must have better homes. Try as we may to find a substitute for the home in the training of citizens, we are foredoomed to failure. The basis of American citizen - ship is the American home and it must remain so unless human nature is transformed. Citizenship runs back to character, and character runs back to . habits and attitudes. Habits are formed by a series of acts. "Sow an act and reap a habit; sow a habit and reap a character." In banking we lend money on credit. In order to obtain a loan, one must build up his credit. The banker doesn't lend money on present professions of honesty and capacity. He takes 1 into. consideration the life of the pios- I ■ pective borrower checking up on his acts and transactions from early ; manhood. If the general course of ]ife justifies trusting the man, he is trusted. If the course is crooked, his application for a loan is t denied. Credit is built up by innumerable little acts, many of which may seem unimportant at the moment. Little by little one builds his J credit standing. So it is with character. From the time the child be - j conies conscious, he is reacting to the stimulus of life about him. Chan - nels are being established in his brain. Connections of thought are being made; attitudes are bei:ig determined. These are the golden years when good citizens can be made. It all depends upon how well we do our work, and that in turn depends upon how much we know about child training, and how willing we are to apply what we know. ■ With this conception of the importance of early training for citizenship in mind, we realize the need for better training for the most, responsible work in life— that of training little children. We have attempted to help parents meet their responsibilities thru parent - teacher organizations and thru parent education courses. Ey such means we hope to bring to parents the principles of child psychology and character training so that they may take better advantage of those precious first five years. We are convinced that to have better citizens l|i we must first have better parents. </seg>
            <seg id="p382">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The final test of education, its development of ethical character, is fundamentally the task of the home and the church, with visual edu - cation as to its potency thin the actions of teachers and citizens who are under the keen observations of the children to an extent seldom rralized by them. A teacher gives ethical instruction in every action and attitude nf mind — and so docs every parent. Here is the supreme need for a common standard, that right may be right and wrong, wrong, in the home as in the school, and that some of the good old fashioned virtues of obedience and deference, of coui-tesy and consider - ation which flower into character, may be restored to favor and may p.xoni.-e tlieir '-&lt; n'i ■ influence: iVr right living: is the result of right thinkintr, and thoup-htfulness for others and regard for their opinion are two strong factor? in the productions of that results. Joy Elmer Morgan, Editor of the Journal of the National Educa - tion Association en education for ethical character says, "There is now a growing inclination to accept children as they are — to appreciate their limitations and their gifts, as suggested by Wm. Hawley Smith in his excellent book "All children of All the people". This increasing knowledge of childhood is throwing light on four great sources of character in the child — health, experiences, intelligence, and ideals. Most authorities agree in putting health at the foundation of character development. A sound mind in a sound hody is a funda - mental of happiness. Good health heightens pleasure and diminishes pain. It gives tone to those delicate organs of sense by which we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. It is thru these intricate sense mechan - isms that we get our knowledge of the objective world, and it is by means of objective data that we maintain our sanity in an age when we are constantly dealing with forces that are unseen and remote. Ill health and physical defects tend to fasten the attention of chil - dren on themselves to the exclusion of those broader interests •which, ' underlie the happy life. Health makes hard work pleasure, and honesty and courage less difficult. Physchiatrists and criminologists are now discovering that much of the prevailing insanity and crime are due to physical defeats. Health — including both the mental and the physical — is a founda - tion of character growth. The aim in character culture is greatest hap - piness of the greatest number. In the rightly lived life each year should be happier and richer. In the campaign of ethical character, then, let us put first a reasonable program of physical and health education for every child, with ample provision for parks and play - grounds and classes out of doors. </seg>
            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION . If the child is to grow in ethical character, there must be things to do. that involve moral situations. Progress is not made by don'ts and quits and. stops. Necessary as these may be at times, they are not the normal approach to growth, joy and power. Let us, then, in the campaign for ethical character, seek to create ■ a school that is rich in freedom, fertile in responsibilities within the' ' power of the child, generous in its provision for clubs and free activi - ties working in cooperation with organizations like Boys and Girl Scoute-built around a curriculum that thinks of education as child - centered rather than knowledge-centered. BUSINESS SIDE OF HOMEMAKING CLARA INGRAM JUDSON "Where shall I put this?" . a -TT\ **, &amp; daily question tha t P uzzl es the homemaker who has decided to keep a record of every cent spent. Perhaps every business iias as many extras and unusual expenses as are incurred by the home Plant but it is certain they can't have any more! No sooner is a home account book made out with columns and lines for everv imagin - able entry and lo!! something has to be bought or provided for or' repaired and the novice is dismayed when the neat columns are sur - veyed There seems not a place where the unexpected expense can lay its head. A shoe shine, raising the kitchen sink,, the ticket you .thought you had to buy which bids fair to be no advancement and certainly is -no desired luxury, hair pins which are neither food nor clothing and all the many odds and ends that in most household ac - counts get into a poor, orphaned column called miscellaneous. A good deal of the occasion for this dismay at the apparent helter - skelterness of home bookkeeping comes from our long inaccurate think - ing about home and personal expenses. We haven't been trained to think accurately about spending money, so many a time we spend be - cause we happen to want something without ever a thought as to the all-roundness of our financial situation. Fortunately the problem isn't half as complicated as it looks' at first glance; indeed, it isn't compli - cated at all and a very little straight thinking will make the whole question seem very simple. One of the first things to decide in setting up the budget system of business is that there shall be no miscellaneous column. If yoir have such a column, five dollars a month will slip into it, yet sixty ■dollars a year is far too much to spend without knowing what you get </seg>

            <seg id="p386">tKl'OKT OK NKBKASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE for it. That's just what money entered in the miscellaneous column means ; it means you don't know what you got for it. You think it wasn't op'Tatin?- expense, or food or clothing or advancement or luxury ni ,«,avinirs; you know pretty well what' is was not, but don't know what is wa.-, and that's poor business. .Wxt, what (io you want your money to get for you? That's easy. Y.'ii htivp to have food, shelter and clothing and you want to have II a; ni;ch &gt; l.sp ;:■■ possible for your money. ' II For tin p'l.nn v, ho boards, food and shelter are fairly easy to [I account for as they usually can be paid in lump .sums, but the home- Ij maker doesn't riii'.' it a. u simple — she has to account for 0&gt;" thousand Ir and one little expenses that go toward keeping up a home. Just as 1 soon, however, as she begins to think of her home as a business plant, 11 th( n she can begin to decide what expenses properly can be charged to operation. The expenses that fall under "Operation" are listed in one of the aceompan&gt;iiiR tables-. All of these items, it will be noticed, go towards making up the externals of the thing we call "home". Twenty - five to thirty-five per cent of the family income will be accounted for in this single heading. In some cases just at the present time, an even higher percentage of income may be used for operating altho such an increase is at a great sacrifice of all-round efficiency and should never be a permanent policy. "Food" seems to be an easy column to keep but in case any meals are taken out, th" careful housewife will want to keep a separate record in a sub-column for such expense so she can tell exactly what meals served from her own kitchen have cost. This may seem like an unimportant matter, but just as soon as the housekeeper knows exactly how much she is spending for food. ju6t that soon will she have a chance to divert some of that money from food to savings. Many times we spend for food and say we have to spend it, when What we really mean is that we have to spend it for food we are used to. A little study into the principles of eating wouid save many a dollar and increase health. In the interest of healthful living it is well to recall I' that experts tell us the money spent for milk should be the same ■ 1 monthly as the money spent for meat except in faniiliej where there me M veral young children, i'l which case the money sp.nt for milk should be more than money spent for meat. This is an interesting point to think over when you wonder why your meat bill is so high and why you feel so "loggy" and miserable in the spring time. The clothing column would seem as simple as the food column. It is for new clothes, but as a matter of fact, it's for much more than that. It records all money spent for new clothes, for accessories (here comes the hair nets) ant: also all money used for the upkeep of I I </seg>
            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION clothes such as shoe shines, pressing/cleaning and dyeing. A separate record should be kept for each member of the family. It well renavs the time and bother. ' v * AH moneys spent for that which increases efficiency and usefulness is recorded under "Advancement". This includes money allotted for health. Real economy means allotting health money regularly and spending it for. annual physical examinations and for semi-annual visits to the dentist. Thus weaknesses will be discovered in time and health will be guarded as well as money saved. "Advancement" also includes money for recreation, books and the like, education (this will mean some clubs, lectures ami concerts as well as actual tuition), gifts and charity. The. careful accountant will wish to keep separate sub-columns for these various items as it is easier to make out income tax papers if a separate record is kept for all charitable giving. "Luxuries" are the things you like but can do without with no real loss of health or efficiency. What is a luxury for one is not even desired by another so each must, decide what will go into that column. It pays to be honest and to find out frankly just what your luxuries are. Then, if hard times come along and you haven't as much to spend, it is an easy matter to lop off luxuries till a more sunny day, financially. Keep a careful record of all expense, putting each item under the proper heading and at the end of the quarter, check up and see how actual expenses compare with the budget decided upon for the year. The money saved- should be more than tfiat spent for luxuries and should be half or more than half of the sum of that spent for luxuries and advancement. Last and most important of all, the saving column that should come first in every account book. Many folks ask questions about savings; just what are they and how should they be counted? Money that is "saved" includes that part of the income which is put m the sayings bank, into government or other securities, payments on properties and certain forms of insurance such as twenty-payment life or endowment; Money invested in new equipment which will enhance the value of the "home plant" comes under the head of "home investments." For just as a factory owner may increase his business efficiency by building a new power house, or putting in a sprinkler system, so the homemaker must make occasional investments in his nome-the new sleeping porch, a washing machine. This new invest - ment is not to replace something worn oui^-that is charged under operating expense-but to .bring home something new and value - increasing. </seg>
            <seg id="p388">UEI'OKT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OP AGRICULTURE Money that is "saved" for a special purpose, such as a trip, a motor or the like, is not really money saved; it is merely set aside for a future use and when finally spent, should be charged under the pro - per heading;.

HOW THE AGRICULTURE COLLEGE HELPS THE • HOMEMAKERS OF MY COUNTY MRS. CLIFFORD ESHELMAN, Red Cloud, Nebraska I would divide the homemaker into four classes of people, thus: first, those who think they need no help; second, those who are too proud to accept help; third, those who are ignorant of the help they might receive; fourth, those that have receptive minds. In those of the class of the ignorant type, I told one woman that I would like to have her come and study convenient kitchens with us and she said, "I will not do any more kitchen work than I am doing now. I will come to club to take care of my grand - daughter". Well, she is still coming to club to look after grand - daughter. In. the class of men and women with receptive minds, they know there ib help and they are ready to receive it. If you are a person with a receptive mind there is much to learn. The attitude that the College of Agriculture takes is suggestive and not com - pulsory. It merely suggests that there is a better way to raise your hogs, after observing the work that you are doing. Then if you are not willing to take other suggestions, they are not going to force you to. You are .adults and have the right to choose. If the teacher suggested to John that he do this and that, instead of com - manding him, it would not work very well, but we are no longer children. and all people can do is suggest to us. Education begins when school days are over with experience as the head master and conditions are the under-teacher and so we are progressive, or else we are going back. Since the work is sug - gestive, it is up to you to get the full measure of help from our Col- </seg>
            <seg id="p390">I'.EPOKT OF NKBHASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lege of Agriculture. We have great advantages for knowledge. These come in the form of circulars, newspapers and bulletins. I have put these first because I believe they reach more people than other helps. In looking over my county, I asked all the people where they were reared, in town or in the country, and I found with one exception the men were reared on the farm and stayed on the farm. I found ten women who have never lived on the farm before they .vere married. Most girls do not choose the farm, but just get that thrown in with the man and the diamond ring. Can you imagine the young bride on the first butchering day when John brings large amounts of meat into the wash house and says that he has done all that he can with it and the rest is up to her? She has never seen so much meat in her life, except in the butcher shop and does not know where to begin. Can you image on an early spring morning when John calls and tells her to get up and that about all of the chickens in the box are dead. To girls raised in town these things are tear - ful. I was raised in town and was never on a farm in my life until I was married. Because of these things, many couples can not make a go of the farm and we find big, strapping fellows who should be tilling the soil, taken to town to work behind the counter selling peanuts. It is up to the women to make a go of the farm. It is possible for town girls to learn the farm because there is so much material available if they will just study it. Aside from that, there is so much knowledge to be gained from our women's home demonstration clubs and 4-H clubs. In Webster county we had eight clubs composed of 99 women. We thought if we got 14 clubs we could have the demonstrators with us for two days, one day in the north part of the county and one in the south part. So the women and myself organized 14 clubs. When Miss Smith came out, she said, "Only 14 clubs! You really should have 16." Well, we got so enthused, that we got 20 clubs. So instead of 99 members we had 276, and the women were really interested in it. These ciubs are the outgrowth of kensington clubs. Women don't care to travel that far to sew in the afternoons. Wom - en really want work and like to work. I have asked in our club if the women could have any kind of - assistance that they wanted, what kind they would want. Some said they would like a course in nursing, One mother said, "My baby was sick once and I could not get a doctor. I would have given any - thing 1 owned to have known how to fight a fever." Another thing women need to be informed on is laundering. I found they put in a surprising amount of time on this. Few of the women had power </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION washers. Why don't you have them? The husbands have all the new machinery and trucks to help in their work. Perhaps there are four times as many radios as there are power washers. Is it be - cause the radio is a family affair and the laundry is not? I do not know. I think if the matter of a power washer was pushed the women could have them, if men could have fine cars, implements, etc. Another thing the' women need and most of them do not know that they need it, is to keep records. The women do not keep a record on the ' chickens, because there is no one to take up their papers. Could- this not be carried on thru clubs? These women - do not realize what keeping records would mean to them. If they kept records they would cull as no orator could induce them to 1 cull. We would have 150 women in our county keeping records, where we now have only 6 or 7. These records could be handed in to county agents. I would like to see. a record kept and taught thru our project ladies. Much toward contentment could be accomplished, if poultry could be put on a paying basis. I am so thoroly in - terested in this subject and talk it so .much that one day my little boy said to me, "Mother, if you would drop egg money, would it break?" Another I thing I want to talk about is recreation. Did you every stdp' to thing that preachers, bookkeepers, teachers, etc., all get summer vacations ? Often they spend a part of that vacation with us when we have our hands fuU in the summer time with j threshers, hayers, etc. We would gladly have them in the winter time. It is a treat for them to get on a farm. One time when I had threshers, I had as many guests as threshers. For this reason, the mother's summer camps are a wonderful' thing for the women on the farm. These are conducted on the order of summer chautauqua, [/ We can write anyone and say we are going to br gone the first 1 ' week in June. " ■■'.■'.. No one buys a radio for the education it furnishes them, but for recreation. The College of Agriculture puts on many educa - tional programs and programs full of inspiration. Shortly before Thanksgiving, I happened to tune in on the University and heard a well known voice telling the story of a Thanksgiving: greeting. We were so glad to be able to listen to a program of this kind in the \' midst of the confusion and tasks of our busy life. It was like a Denediction to hear somthing so thoroly beautiful. Our College of Agriculture brings wonderful things to us along this line. One of the greatest things they bring to us is contentment. I believe there is no class of people that have as beautiful J' home life as farmers. I once asked a question in my club of how </seg>
            <seg id="p392">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE many evenings were spent away from home. It was surprising how many farmers spend their evenings at home. Most of them were out only one night in a month, the highest number was five nights. As a class, we stay at home. The children come home from school and stay at home. It is too far to go to the neighbors. Their lives are very beautifal. The wife can see husband most of, the time as he is doin^ his work. If there is not enough rain for the crops, she knows it ahead of time and is able to cheer her husband. When a boy is feeding a bucket calf he is in good company. If you are a homemaker on the farm just be proud of it. You are familiar with the old story of the two sisters who lived under practically the same conditions. One was named Martha, the other Mary. Martha was cumbered with much serving. She saw only drudgery. Mary saw spiritual things. I believe it . is within the power of the College of Agriculture to make us not Marthas, cum - bered with much sen-ice, but Marys who have chosen the better part. WHAT 4-H CLUBS MEANS TO THE HOME MARGARET TROBAUGH, Fairfield 4-H Club work is one of the greatest helps to the home that I know. Many have been aided in carrying on the work in their own homes by what they have learned thru work. For instance, I have a girl friend who, I think, owes her life's happiness to club work. When she entered her first club she could not even bake a cake. Her mother would rather do the work than take the time to show her. In our community we first organized a canning club, and my friend seemed very much interested in the work. We studied our booklets and pamphlets. Thru these we learned to can fruit and vegetables in the easier and better way. Each was required to do her own work individually. In this way each learned to do her work without the aid of her mother. After finishing this project, my friend joine&lt;l a cooking club. Not long ago she was married and her present home is only a short distance from mine. She has a happy home and I have heard many people remark about what a wonderful cook and housekeeper she is. 1 think that this shows very plainly what club work can do for any girl. For me club work has done a great deal. Before I belonged to a club, I could not can at all and could cook only a little. Now, when I am at home, I do nearly all the canning, cooking and baking. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Besides the cooking club, I have completed one project in sewing, one in hot lunch, three in poultry, -and one in livestock. By taking the project work in sewing and thru the leadership of a sewing club, I have learned to make my own clothes. This saves a great deal of money. Another club which is important to the home is the hot lunch club. IV keeps the rural children in good health, and it teaches them what they should eat for a balanced meal. I know of one little boy who would not eat his breakfast until they started to serve hot lunches in the school. After learning the reason for three balanced meals a day, he began to eat his breakfast and he gained in health . very rapidly. In some cases girls clubs have been organized to increase the family income. Before the 4-H Club work there were many things that peo'ple ate from their gardens in the summer. As soon as the season was over they had to wait until the next season to have these foods. Thru the work of clubs girls have learned to can many things which used to be destroyed. They have also learned to use combinations of things that are left from meals. This does away with much waste. Until I joined the poultry club we had a mixed flock, of chickens. I started with a few purebreds. My parents became in - terested and after I had finished the project they took the flock over. In a like manner I started with a purebred pig and my father ; took my purebred hogs over. I joined the pig club that year be - cause there was no girls club in the community. You can see that 4-H Club work helps not only the boys and. girls but reaches beyond them into the home, to the father, mother, and even to the community. I have found a statement 'by Gov. McMullen which illustrates my idea exactly: He says, "One of the activities in rural life that is , approved by every one is that of the boys and. girls in club work. To watch the growth of a calf or pig or a flock of chickens, making friends of them as they respond to kind treatment and good living, affords keen and abiding pleasure. It develops responsibility, initia- I tive, a desire to do things betier than dad or mother did, enjoying a real thrill when a prize is won. It is not ; so much that one is , first among a group, but pride that something worth while has been '. accomplished." • As Irwin Hutchinson was unable to be present, Mr. Frisbie gave this introduction to his paper: "About ten minutes ago I learned that Irwin Hutchinson would be unable . to be here, because he is &lt;]'&lt; sick in bed, but characteristic of him, he wrote down his talk and </seg>

He was chosen as one of the most outstanding' workers in boys and girls clubs in the state last year to represent our 4-H folks in the first National boys and girls camps. For four years Irwin has been helping other boys and fiirls and acting as local leader. He has been chosen as one of the Superintendents of the Lancaster County Fair Association because of his activities." 4-H CLUB WORK AND AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IRWIN HUTCHINSON My subject is 4-H Club work and agricultural practices. I think th( most practical thintr 4-H club work is doing is turning out better citizens and better men and women from the boys anil girls of Nebraska. William Jardine, Secretary of Agriculture, says: "One of the most significant movements in the U. S. today is the. effort being made by farm people to cooperate in production and merchandising and in the development of a fuller country life. In this movement one of the greatest contribution comes from boys and girls club work."' One of the most outstanding pieces of club work in Nebraska is the dairy calf clubs. There are now 250 purebred and high grade dairy calves in Nebraska under the perpetual club contract. Ac - cording- to the contract the first female returns to the man who ' originally furnishes the boy or girl with the calf. The parents and the boys and girls have been so sold on the project that rather than return the first offspring they have bought the first offspring. The minimum B. F. ' record on the dams of these heifers is 300 lb. B. F. with an average between 300 and 650 lb. The average production for the whole state is only about 155 lb. B. F. Thru this we can see a marked difference in the value of the purebred dairy cow of the club boy or girl and the value of the average Nebraska dairy cow. Thru experimental work here at the College of Agriculture it has been proven that it is more economical to feed baby beeves than older cattle. This fact has been brought to the people out over the state, thru 4-H club work more than any other one thing. </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA HOME | ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION • . ■ I In my home community I [know that baby beef clubs have aided materially in changing the feeding practices of many fanners. Thru pig club work hog lot sanitation and improved types have been brought before the eyes of the (farmers. When an extension man has something he wishes to bring to the people he always finds the boys and girls much keener and more interested than the older people. Last year over 50 individual hog houses were built by the boys of the Waverly Vocational Education Department arid that many or more will be built again this year. The most of these hog houses go to the farms of boys who are or have been in pig club work. Poultry club work is another phase of club work which is very practical in its application to agriculture. Thru poultry work the boys and girls learn culling and better, methods of feeding and man - agement I am especially interested n that phase of club work which rep - resents Nebraska's greatest crop. That is corn club work. We have in our community probably one of the most outstanding corn clubs in the state. In corn club work the boys learn better methods of selecting and storing seed corn, judge grain, grade hay, put up educational booths at fairs, identify weeds, learn how to control them and many other practical things. Corn club work has aided materially in teaching the farmers the value of adapted seed and thus increasing the production of corn per acre. ■• • This year two demonstration plots were carried on in connection with the work in the Waverly corn club. A total of 75 plats were planted in these two plots. Regional strains ' from ten different states, seed of each of the club members own corn, hybrid and inbred strain from the Nebraska Experiment Station and commercial growers, seed treated with Bayer dust and Sen Sen, and rough and smooth corn, were compared in the plots this year. The regional strains from the different states and the home grown corn of the club members show the adaptation of the home grown seed and the advisability of using home grown seed.. The hybrids and pure lines show what' is being done in corn im - provement work at the Nebraska and other Experiment stations. One definition of service is "the price we pay for the space we occupy." I think we older club members can best serve our clubs, our </seg>
            <seg id="p396">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE communities, and our country by serving as local leaders of clubs. By serving as local leaders we can pass on to the younger boys and . I girls some of the benefits we have derived from club work and some of the better fanning practices we have learned here at the College of Agriculture. Mr. Frisbie in introducing Ruth Davis spoke as follows: ■ . "Ruth Davis of Syracuse is another of the four young people chosen as one of the most outstanding workers in boys and girls clubs in the state last year to represent our 4-H clubs in the first National boys and girls camp in Washington. I am especially proud of the work Ruth has done.' 1 THE NATIONAL 4-H CAMP RUTH DAVIS, Syracuse Seven months ago we were in Washington. Four of us were chosen for our record in club work and leadership, then we were judged on a story we each had to write on club life. The financing of the trip was quite a problem. Our trip was a problem. Our trips were financed half by our own counties. We are very proud to think they were willing to do this. The rest of the money was given by different organizations. My money was furnished by the Lincoln Rotary Club. We should be very proud of the fact that such clubs as the Rotary and Chamber of Commerce are backing our clubs. By this they show that they know the hope of tomorrow is in our boys and girls of today. The whole week spent in Washington was a great inspiration. It is a city of great historical interest and we saw things we had studied about and were much more impressed with them than before. They are always going to mean more to us for having seen them. We made friends from eastern coast to the western and it is wonderful to receive letters and Christmas cards from all over the United States, helping to tie us up as a nation. The personnel in the various departments of Agriculture was fascinating. Having met them causes us to have more j interest in them and what they are doing. No one could see Washing- - ton as we saw it. We saw it from the inside out. We saw all the places of interest. The greatest feature of all was the atmosphere of our own camp. We were chosen for their trip, not because we had worked for it, because we did not know anything about it before hand, but were chosen only because of the work that we had done to earn it. The people were very much worth while and were the ones who really did things. </seg>
            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Each evening we had vesper service of some sort, giving us a chance to find ourselves. There were some Indians in camp. It was hard to realize that the first Americans were Indians. They had a part in each vesper service. It caused us to feel a sympathy for their service. Chief Smith himself has written a poem that shows the type of thing we listened to in Washington. It follows: To help lift the burden, point the better way, Give vision io toil and the hope of a ' better day. To teach the larger life, encouragement of soul. To still greater tasks, a still greater goal. To look heyond the' plough, teach a more full part In community and town, in assembly and mart. j Club work is training, of greatest value when It is the goal of achievement, for the inspiration — the making— of men. In introducing the next speaker, Mr. Frisbie spoke of him as fol - lows: "I wish that you might have some of the fond recollections that I have when these people get up and perform as they have today. At these times I always think of Guy McReynolds. The first time I met Guy was in the laboratory in Fairneld High School. I had been telling about what Rome other clubs had been doing. Guy came up and said, "Where do you get the information about the pig clubs"? I told him that information was prepared by the Animal Husbandry Depart - ment, the dairy clubs by the Dairy Department and so on. He asked me more about the Agricultural College and said, "Do you suppose I will ever get to go?" The answer will be given here on the platform. Guy not only knows his vegetables but when to market them. When he was .told of this talk he had to give, he asked me what he should talk about and I told him just to tell you the truth." 4-H CLUBS AS AN INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGE GUY McREYNOLDS, Fairfield If it had not been for 4-H Club work, I would never have been to college. In 1921 when I first came down to Lincoln in the club work I wondered why I could not attend and every year when I returned from club week, I hoped that I could some day go to college. I rep - resented our county for two different years at the Nebraska State Fair with judging teams. When I came to school here I became interested in judging work. Just yesterday I found that I was chosen on a team that will next week represent the College at the livestock show at Denver. I was very much pleased. </seg>
            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE '% After I made up my mind to come to college, I found that I lacked cash. The club work helped to take care of this consideration. I got the idea of breeding and showing Chester White hogs and have been showing at fairs each fall since 1921. In this way I accumulated enough cash to bring me to the College of Agriculture. I had to make money before I could spend it. So club work was responsible not I only for me wanting to come to college but it has made it possible. I ! believe every student of club work would find club work a benefit to. them in making it possible for them to come to college. ROUND TABLE DISCUSSIONS j The rest of the morning was spent with round table discussions. i Each home maker had the opportunity to attend whichever discussion she desired. Five sections were held. A brief report of each of the dis - cussions follows. Round Table Discussion on Banishing the Bugbear of Finances led by Mr*. Judson The discussion opened with questions from the audience. The { first one was, To how young a child may an allowance be given? Mrs. Judson answered this by saying that the first time a child asks for a penny, he should be given some money and to be told that it would have to last for a certain length of time. Second question, How much freedom should a child be granted in buying clothes? It is well to divide the year into seasons and then allow according to season. Allow as much as the mother would spend • ; and then add a little more because the child will make some mistakes. The child's allowance should be first divided into weeks. Then the • child should be taught to save from the week's allowance for clothes. Stockings and underwear are the first articles that a child should be made responsible for in buying. The mother should learn to keep her hands off unless the child asks for advice. To illustrate this point, Mrs. Judson told how her daughters had been buying their own underwear material with their al - lowance and then making them during their vacations. One sum - mer the girls decided they did not want to make their underwear but preferred to buy them ready made. In purchasing the under garments, the girls did not think of quality and as a result their under - wear was in bad condition long before their allowance permitted buying more. The result was that the next vacation the girls announced that they wanted to make their own underwear. When purchasing the material they were very anxious for suggestions from their mother. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA HOME KCOXOMICS ASSOCIATION The girls said that they had far more respect for their mother because she made a rule and stayed by her word. Often times the younger generation are lax in many things because they have observed that the parents have not stayed by their word. • - Third question, At what age should a child help to earn his own money? As early as the child wants to. Should a mother pay for small tasks done as washing dishes, etc? A child should feel that the home belongs to the whole- family and there are regular duties that must be done. Each child should feel their responsibility in sharing with these duties. • • If some duties are to be hired done, it may be all right to pay a child a small recompense for doing the duty. However, they should not be paid what aYi expert would receive until the child is very ef- . ficient. There are some chores that a child should do without receiving pay for because otherwise a child will get the idea of being paid for everything he does. ' A round table discussion on family finances is most worth while. The budget should be made in the presence of the whole family so that each child will know where the money goes and how much it takes to run a home. There were about 65 present at the discussion. . . . Round Table Discussion on Making the Most of our Present Day Furnishings by Miss Evelyn Metzger Curtains and draperies and walls are things that are renewed from time to time so if you are going to do these parts over be sure of the right color and design for the particular room before you buy. Walls,, ceiling, floor, curtains and draperies are the most important features in a room, because they are the background against which everything is seen. If these are well chosen, nothing else matters much, except that one must consider arrangement and not have too many things about. Generally in starting to make the most of what we have we begin by eliminating the unnecessary and unlovely objects that somehow get into our houses. We should learn to differentiate between genuine beauty in an object and poor design whether it is in an old hooked rug or an oriental. Usually if a thing is useful and comfortable it has some beauty or can be made beautiful. The old fashioned patent rocker can be worked over into a beautiful chair by padding the unattrac - tive angles of its ornate walnut frame work and covering in old blue </seg>
            <seg id="p400">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE velour. A hard and straight line mission chair is improved with a chintz slip cover. Many old glass oil lamps can be fitted with shades and will take on new light and interest. Good arrangement is most important in creating beauty. A balanced effect of large pieces of furniture on opposite sides of the room and large pieces arranged parallel with the walls is important. A bit of weaving, an old shawl or a remnant of figured drapery material hung on the wall over a piece of furniture is good to make that piece the dominant interest against a wall. Getting the right things together will give beauty. One must appreciate that besides the harmony of sizes, colors and shape there must be a consistency in ideas. We should arrange in a group the things that go best together — the old chest of drawers with an old mirror, a piece of weaving and a hooked or rag rug. New materials look shiny and raw when used with the rich mellow quality of color that old wood and old textiles take on. "Art in Every Day Life" by Harriet and Vetta Goldstein was sug - gested for reference. A study of the principles of design was sug - gested so one will really be able to judge for one's self what is good in design and not have to depend upon what people say, regardless of rhyme or reason. Clipping pictures that seem good and analyzing them according to principles of design helps one to grow in the ap - preciation of beauty. There were 58 women present. Round Table Discussion on "Meat — How To Judge and Cook It", led by Miss Rebekah Gibbons Miss Gibbons opened the meeting with a brief discussion of the meat roasting work done at the University in connection with the National Purnell Quality of Meat project and told the group of the household method of roasting meat with a thermometer which has developed from this. She distributed the U. S. Department of Agricul - ture leaflet No. 17, Cooking Beef according to the Cut, and commented briefly on it. Miss Marjorie Schultz then told the group how a meat judging team functions and what the Home Economics team has done this past year. Miss Louise Genung then conducted an identification contest for the group. Fifteen pieces of meat such as would be found in any butcher shop were on display. After the women had tried identifying these, Miss Genung gave them the correct name for the cut and briefly discussed the proper methods of cooking it. Miss Dorothy Norris then discussed the factors influencing the quality of meat using wholesale cuts provided by Armour and Co. </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The women learned what factors effect tenderness, high percentages of lean, juiciness and flavor. A general discussion followed with many excellent suggestions for storing, aging, and canning meat made by the various women in attendance. Thirty-five were present Round Table Discussion on Discipline in the Home Led by Mrs. Eva Morse Mrs. Morse opened the meeting with a discussion of the funda - mentals of discipline. She suggested that we test our discipline by seeing if we can substitute the word teach for discipline. If we can then we may know our discipline is sound. Among the questions that were asked were: What can I do to interest my little girl in outdoor activities? How can 1 get my children to carry their responsibilities? My boy insists upon having a gun and I .think he should not have one. What shall I do? How can I train a child to know the difference between truth and imagination ? There were forty present. Round Table Discussion on What Shall be the Next Step in our Home Demonstration Extension Work? led by Mary-Ellen Brown To open the discussion the question was asked, "What Home Demonstration Extension work' is being- done now that you and your club are enjoying?" A number of replies were given in which the ■ women told about the value of the different projects which the special - ists are demonstrating. They also expressed . their approval of the methods which are being used. The sec'ond question asked was: "'Which parts of the work do you wish to have continued and what more do you wish to have added?" Summarizing briefly from the replies which were given, are the fol - lowing: We want to have the music project continue and we hope it will follow the plan being used now which is that of having the notes on the sheets. Perhaps something could be done to help us with budgets by having 1 each specialist give some work on budgets during one of her monthly training: meetings. </seg>
            <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Some time in the future we would like to have a specialist who has a project on interior decoration. This was followed by a discussion of the Mothers Vacation Camps. They are in favor of having the camp thrown open to any women in the county who are members of the Home Demonstration Project or Study-Clubs rather than to limit the camps to only two members from each club. If the members enrolled became too large to be handled, then those who paid their fees first would be entitled to attend. They asked to have the music work continued in the camps, also the vesper services, stunt night and the county song contests. To have a few good talks but not too many, to have parliamentary practice work given and to have recreation and child study work similar to that given by Miss Cleland and Mrs. Bruce. They wished to have some hand craft work given for the clubs and thought a good way to start it in the state would be to have work of this kind given at the camps. In this way we could find out how well the women enjoy it A discussion then followed about the desire which the women have for assistance on the child training problems. . It was suggested that assistances along this line could be given in a county if there was a Home Demonstration Agent in the county who could attend to the details which would be needed. There seems to be a strong senti - ment toward having- work done on child training in the near future. As Miss Smith's project on the Convenient Kitchens has been given in nearly all of the counties, it 13 to be discontinued next fall so the women were asked for suggestions in regard to her next project. Some of the women suggested that the laundry work is a big- problem in the homo and a project on this would be helpful. Some of the wom - en thought it would be well to have only a part of the project on laundering but after a discussion on what would be included the in - terest seemed to prow. Even short cut meals for wash day were sug - gested as a need. There was also some thought given to meeting the over-crowded condition at the county training meetings we will be facing in some of the counties next year due to the growth in the number of clubs desiring; to have the work and the limited number of specialists. The sentiment seemed to be strongly in favor of having the presi - dents of the clubs present at the first meeting for the year's work and have them again at the February meeting. This helps the president to keep closely in touch with the plans for the work and its progress. More work on the study of pictures was requested. </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' At the Home Demonstration Project Leaders luncheon, five other round table discussions were held. A report of each of these dis - cussions will be found with the Thursday morning's program. "WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON The afternoon program opened with the president, Mrs. Berger, presiding. The music for the opening of the meeting was furnished by a quartet from Wesleyan Universtiy. They were: Mr. Dwight Mason, Tekamah, first tenor Mr. Floyd Hason, Clay Center, second tenor Mr. Norris Schroeder; Hoskins, baritone ,':'■- Mr. Loren Winship, Lincoln, bass They sang the following selections: The Old Gray Robe Ashes of Roses — Cole Boys of the Old Brigade— Parks "HOW CAN WE MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE CHANGING HOME" MRS. J. G. ACKERSON Through all the changing years the same old' story has gone out of changing conditions and the changing home including the dangers to youth and' to future because as David Harum said "Human nature is the same in all of us, only more so. in some", and in each generation these changing conditions have been viewed with apprehension and not without cause for all dangers to the nation those that threaten the home are and should be of the greatest concern to all interested in a strong and stable government for no nation rises above the level of its homes and we do not always stop and think when we criticize those high in authority and ask ourselves "Who is the Government". Our favorite indoor sport is to grab a newspaper and say with a groan "What is the Country coming! to", forgetting the we are the country and we. are the government. So it is with our young people: we look them over and shake our heads and wonder what they are coming to and what they will say and do next forgetting that they are precisely what we were at their age only more honest; in fact their honesty is appalling: and we - who were raised in a more reserved manner are ignorant of. just how to deal with this frankness and honesty. Henry Van Dyke says "The greatest wisdom on earth is that which knows its own ignorance", and we of the present generation will show our wisdom </seg>
            <seg id="p404">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE by remembering that we were just as foolish and not half so well equipped to meet the world.. Remember that each child is a separate entity and requires separate understanding and training. "You my grind their souls in the self-same mill, You may bind them, brow to brow, But the poet will follow the rainbow still, While his brother will follow the plow A document copied from an Asyrian tabled dated 2820 B. C. says, "Our earth is degenerate in these days, bribery and corruption are com - mon, children no longer obey their parents, the end of the world evir dently is approaching". Another, Plutarch's Lives says," When Caesar - happened to see stranger in Rome carrying young dogs and monkeys in their arms, and fondly caressing them, he asked whether the women in their country ever bore children, thus reproving with a proper severity those who lavish upon brutes that natural tenderness which is is due only to mankind." Thus history assures us that every age has pointed to some incidents which appear to be in the process of over - whelming society and the home. These articles sound very much like present day writing in magazines and newspapers concerning the young business woman and the general decay of home life. We have traveled a long distance from the necessity for friendly service that confronted our pioneer parents, but humanity is the same now and forever, and the need of unselfish kindness and an understand - ing of the problems of our neighbors and above all, of our young peo - ple, will go far to help us adapt our homes to changing conditions for it is true that we can never go back but must press forward even if the going is difficult. Did it ever occur to you that it is mainly in Christian lands that the world Home appears ? We have the equiva - lent of House in many languages from the hovels of savage tribes to the palaces of others, but many languages have no word that means what we, in English, call The Home, and to us of the great middle class in the United States I sometimes think Home means the most as we are neither so poor that we cannot appreciate it nor burdened with such great wealth as to have too many homes, and consequently rests upon us a greater responsibility. This being the case, I see only the age - old remedies of Patience, Love and Self-Sacrifice, that have been prac - ticed by parents thru all the ages, and by Parents, I mean BOTH, as under present day conditions Father as well as Mother must be on the job teaching the children the same old reliance on obedience to all law and dependence on the Bible and true religion. Mrs. R. E. Norris, leader of two poultry clubs of Cas3 county, was introduced by Mr. Frisbie as entitled to carry away the state silver cup </seg>

The first is to do less work; the second to (work more effectively, saving time and effort., ■ By doing less work one does not mean letting beds go unmade, dishes unwashed or the family unfed. The home must be run with orderly care, meals must be nourishing and appetizingly served and the house must be clean. But there is a happy medium between neglect which lowers efficiency and happiness, and the fussy, over-particular care which pampers the family and makes ' of the mother a slave, a martyr, or both. No matter how busy or tired she is, there is one task every house - keeper should do and do well — her own thinking. It's high time every woman made an efficiency expert of herself and overhauled her own job. "But I'm too busy." exclaims some one. "I have my hands full every day. What time have I for studying my job?" That excuse is no alibi; it is merely the proof that her job needs studying. She above all others, is the one who cannot afford not" to study! Start today. Take the first task of the morning. Or if the father must get off early and the children are in a scramble for school, wait till they are" all gone and then take an inventory of tasks to be done, and later in the day think over the early morning work. What </seg>
            <seg id="p406">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE would you naturally do first after the children are gone? Why do this job? Is it necessary? Do you do it in the easiest possible way? Then the next task. Why do it? Is it necessary? Do you do it in the easiest possible way? Don't fear being lazy. It is just as thrifty to save effort as it is to save cash; waste of either time or money never bring success. In the olden days the housekeeper who was everlastingly on her job. who worked from sunrise till sunset and then tackled her sewing in the evening was held up as a shining light. Not so now. We know there is too much of interesting and useful work needing to be done outside in our larger housekeeping or inside in many activities we might enjoy or profit by. The model housekeeper of this year is the woman who works with such judgment and skill that she does not have to work all day. "It's all every well to talk theory," say someone, "but I wish you'd come to my house and tell me what to leave out!" Very well, Look at your living room, Is it easy to clean? Have you any unnecessary pictures, vases, pillows, curtains or the like? Every single article in that room ought to have its purpose — you should actually need it there for use or for beauty. How many wedding pres - ents, prizes and gifts — to say nothing of one's own reckless purchasesl ■ — would have to hurry out of the room if we used that test. The Japanese fashion of enjoying one ornament at a time is an excellent one. A room freed of useless frippery is not barren, it is restful, beautiful and easy to clean. Now visit the dining room. Could its arrangement be improved? Is the service table conveniently placed ? Is silver that is not needed daily kept out on the buffet or is it wrapped away in camphor? How about the bed rooms? Is the family trained to air beds, to pick up personal effects ? Are the linen closets and clothes basket so placed that even youngsters can get out their own towels and put away soiled clothings? The mother who with thoughtless, intended kindness, "picks up" after a child of five, gets out a towel, straightens a closet, makes herself work and, indefinitely worse, gives her child' a training in dependency. If each member of the family gets the habit of caring for personal belongings, the mother is saved at least an hour in the best part of the morning. And better still the family gets an in - valuable training they will appreciate later on. By this time the woman who has looked at every particle of her work with a question mark in her eye will have caught the habit. And once one gets started, it's astonishing how many useless tasks we can discover. </seg>
            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION In this thrifty frame of mind the housekeeper comes to the time-, honored question, "What shall we eat today?" and asks, "How much of my cooking time is spent for actually feeding my family? — How much for social pleasure?" For it must be remembered that the table is the meeting place and a certain amount of care and time may justi - fiably be spent making meal time comfortable and happy.) But one cannot help the follow-up question, "How much of my time at the cook stove is just convention — just for cooking things we are used to but might be happy without?" So much for eliminating work. How can we increase our skill so as to save time and effort? First, by questioning every method and making sure that we use the best. This isn't so easy, either, for we women have a habit of doing things the time-honored way! But by careful reading of article on methods; by getting the newest state university bulletins and study - ing them; and by comparing notes (open mindedly) with other house - keepers, we can improve our ways of working. Then a careful study of labor-saving devices pays, but only what you are certain will actually be helpful in your work. Each additional utensil is just that much more to care for. Make it pay for its keep. Be sure each tool you use is the best type for your work. Anything else merely clutters your work-shop. There is an old proverb that is the housekeeper's best friend, "A place for everything and everything in its place." How much time do you spend in a day, a week, a year, hunting for things. Study your home, room by room, and see that you make a logical convenient place for each thing you own. Then set about the long, difficult, but Oh! so worth-while task, of training yourself and your family to keep things where they ..belong. It can be done. And it pays. Of course these and many other suggestions that might be offered will not take all the work out of housework. But each housekeeper who gives critical thought to simplifying her work and improving her method will find her time well' spent. And time, nowadays, is the most costly commodity there is. We should save our time as we save our money, for saving of time and strength means less sickness, more happiness and enjoyment in the home, and more energy left over for enriching life. . • .

            <seg id="p408">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE The following- reports were given from the Project Leaders Round Table discussions: FAIRS Mrs. Clifford Eshelman, Red Cloud I. It is doubtful if all members of the county fair board are con - versant of the Home Demonstration Project work, that space allowed for the project work exhibits varies with the different counties. II. Home Demonstration Project clubs' exhibits at the State Fair would have an educational value. Nebraska is behind her adjoin - ing states, Kansas, Iowa, and South Dakota, because they have Home Demonstration Project exhibits at their state fairs. III. Without a County Home Demonstration Agent the County Project Chairman should take charge of the fair exhibit, and should be given power to appoint committees on preparing and assembling of fair exhibits. IV. To encourage a good display of project work at the State Fair, it is necessary to have a definite sum to help defray expenses. Money prizes were not considered essential at State Fairs, but were at county fairs. V. Booth exhibits need to be unusual and more, attractive. The use of better worked posters is to be encouraged. Miniature exhibits take too much time in proportion to their value, unless they are unusual. VI. Things brought for exhibts to the State Fair need to be protected from dust and flies. This could be accomplished by use of screened buildings, by separating food exhibits from other exhi - bits, by using dampened saw dust on floors and by more careful handling. LEADERSHIP Mr*. Max Adams, Dannebrog What is a leader? A leader is an individual who leads or directs the way of some action, opinion or movement. Some' of the qualities of good leaders are tactfulness, unselfishness, initiative, spirit of co - operation, dependability, willingness to learn and ability to overlook criticism. </seg>
            <seg id="p409">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION In home Demonstration project work not all members can be leaders, therefore it is not practical to try to take turns acting as • leaders, or to set a certain time limit to act as leaders. Not all leaders realize the importance of their prompt and regular attendance of both county meetings and local club meetings. Members should also be made to feel that their attendance affects the progress of their club. Many project leaders felt that they derive much more benefit from, the work than the time and energy expended. Many club mem - bers would like to meet with the State Agents and get the work, but do not like to give the work to their own groups. We found some clubs thi leaders are helped by the club paying their expenses' for the day, such as gas and dinner. Leaders ex - pressed a great satisfaction in being able to take this work to a group of women who for various reasons have no other way to receive it. Leadership develops an individual by establishing her self con - fidence, creating and reviving her interests and skill and willingness to carry responsibility. It also makes new acquaintances and creates a feeling of unity between town and farm women, women all over the state and women of the different states. GOALS Mrs. H. W. Hunt, Lincoln Our discussion was the finish-up of the club and in speaking of goals some thought it better not to stress goals too much at the first meeting of a new club. Altho in clubs having been organized more than one year it would very likely be better to have a definite un - derstanding of things to be accomplished at the first meeting. Good is accomplished in every project which is impossible to measure by the number of approved practices accomplished by the club. The goal is the ideal which we strive for. Attainment of the goal does not always . work our progress. Some member may have made greater achieve - ment with a 75% completion than others with a 100% completion. Publicity was suggested as a means of reaching outside people and also a means of inspiration to other clubs. It was also suggested that publicity might be a means of having the Nebraska law changed so a home demonstration agent might be secured. We seemed to agree that goals were desirable and completion an incentive for better work and that different projects require different goals and that the satis - faction that comes with a good finish-up was most beneficial. </seg>
            <seg id="p410">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ACHIEVEMENT MEETINGS Mr«. L. E. Rupp, Aurora The members of the round table working on Achievement pro - grams believe that while our present average attendance of fifty-five is good, we should be able to raise this number by the proper use of publicity, by using halls or churches wherever available, by evening meetings and by a cordial invitation to new people. We consider these local meetings very valuable but not of more benefit than the county meeting since in most communities we reach a greater number of new people at the county meeting and it also serves to promote friendliness and good fellowship among the people from all parts of the county. A combined meeting of the men's project, boys and girls clubs and home demonstration projects would be a splendid way to arouse family interest in one another's plans, however, as conditions now exist there are many objections to the plan, tho we do consider it very desirable to have our boys and girls assist in the program whenever possible. A tour or picnic might be a pleasant change from the Achievement program, altho that will depend largely upon the nature of the pro - ject and the wishes of the women themselves. In closing we would like to say that for the most part things are very satisfactory as they are and our greatest problem lies in teaching more people each year to make use of the splendid oppor - tunities available. MAKING THE WORK GROW Mrs. A. R. Leavitt The project leaders in the state are to be highly commended for fine work they have been doing. They have given freely of their time,' put a great deal of effort in the work and in many cases have con - tributed freely of their money in the way of taking their cars, driving about their communities or over their county to push the work. ■ But there is still a great deal to be done. A very small per cent of the rural women have been reached. There are 7000 women in the state taking the work, yet that is less than the population of even some one of the counties. </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION . Our task now is to find ways in which we might make the work grow. One means might be thru the newspapers. We must learn to known our local editors. Call on them.' Get acquainted with them. If they do not know the work explain it to them. Invite them to attend some special meeting of the club. The editor must come in personal contact with the county chairman and project leaders. Then after a press correspondent has been chosen from a club, she must be regular with her items of news and get them in on time. An editor is not interested in stale news. The position of county chairman is practically a new one yet it is growing to be a very important one. The committee felt that great care should be used in selecting a county chairman. She must be a woman deeply interested in the work, willing to put her heart into it and to be able to see the value^of/the work. She must be a woman of strong personality, sympathetic, community spirited, willing to take . suggestions from any one. I; would be well to have the clubs thruout the county invite the county chairman to visit their clubs. She must have the cooperation of all the project leaders and the assistant county chairman. Another way in which project work might grow is to have a visiting day either have a special day or invite women to attend any of the regular meetings or 1 , local and County Achievement. Invite women whom you think you might interest in the work, in fact invite all women. By making exhibits and showing them at local and County Achieve - ments, also County and State Fair is a good way to show what is being accomplished and a splendid way to create a desire for the work. This is also true of the 4-H Club work. The committee thought that sometimes an occasional change of project leaders would be recommended as new leaders might reach a different group of people. Project leaders like county chairmen must have many good qualities. They must be agreeable, and capable of bringing the work back. They must have the cooperation of the club members in order to get the best results from the work. Some mem - bers of the committee from counties having had Home Demonstration Agents, feel that their work is not as well developed as it was in the past. They feel the loss ii the number of 4-H clubs and women's clubs. They feel the need of more training for the 4-H club leaders. Each member of. the committee present expressed a desire for train - ing in community recreation, parliamentary practice, inspirational meetings, community singing and the training of press editors. The program of work is too large for one agent in the county and the </seg>

Davis, Otoe County— President Mrs. Max Adams, Howard County — Vice-President Miss Helen Rocke, Lancaster County — Secretary-Treasurer CHARACTER EDUCATION C. W. TAYLOR— State Superintendent Ladies and Gentlemen, we are pleased to be present at this meet - ing with you for a few moments. Character 'Education has developed so much during the last twenty-five years that it not only covers all of the range of human activities but is covers the full range of human attitudes, and human actions.' • The last Legislature passed what is known as the Character Edu - cation bill, Senate File 236, introduced by Hon. Allen Stinson of Knox County. This bill passed the Legislature by an almost unanimous vote in both houses. It was interesting* to me particularly as a professional school man to watch this bill Las it progressed through the Legislature. I had been conscious, as a school man, for a number of years, that the public was becoming increasingly critical of the public school system in general. I was conscious of course, that during the last ten years we have had a good deal of discussion in the newpapers and periodicals along the line of subjects just as these; what is the. matter with the school system; what' is the matter with our schools; the implied conclusion of which would be that in some way those of us who are responsible for the conduct of the schools are not doing what should be done in the way of leadership. I think now some of Ed - ward Bok's Editorials in the Ladies Home Journal which sort of con - stituted a series of articles first came to my attention; then the minis - ters of all churches both Protestant and Catholic, and the lecturers on the platform have all criticized the schools and I began to wonder if the Legislature was not expressing a cross section of the public at - titude toward the schools. Now "that is a vital problem to myself and to all others who are 'trying to render public service in school activi - ties. I want to say that as a school man I am not conscious of the fact that there is any procedure in school from the time children enter the school ground or building until they leave, this is, pointed in any., other direction than in the direction of right character and citizen - ship. Upon behalf of my \ own profession I am compelled to say that, I am aware of some radical statements in some of the columns of some papers where public opinion has expressed itself in such a </seg>
            <seg id="p414">KKl'OKT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE way that I feel like asking, will you please tell us where we are doing anything that is tending to produce bad character or anything this is not pointed toward the production of the right kind of Character. Now the thing I have just said is the thing that you would expect a school man to say. As a Professor I am more or less sensitive to the things that this law tries to do. So when Senator Stinson, the ■ father of this bill, came into my office, we had a very interesting con - versation. I wanted to assure myself that the Senator really had in mind Character Education as the subject and he assured me that he had this in mind. This is very largely an audience of ladies today and I want to say that the only lady in the Legislature voted against this bill. Mrs. Mabel Gillespie of Sarpy County was the only lady member of the .Legislature and she voted in the negative on this bill. Don't take that seriously ladies, but it is one of the facts that I noticed when the bill was passed through the Legislature and I just thought I would mention it. The bill made it the duty of our office to prepare a course of study on this subject by September 1. I am sure that the Legislature was not conscious of the problem involved. Courses of study don't grow on trees like fruit. You cannot reach into the blue sky and pull down a course of study. Courses of study evolve out of experience of many years and judgment of many people. The course of study should be the result not only of the judgment and experience of a Professor but it should come on the advice of students and of people outside of the profession itself. I am confident that the common citizens of the state should help us work out this problem and I am sure that would help us if we are going to evolve a course of study in Character Edu - cation which will be satisfactory. After this bill became a law I called Mr. Burnham, then the Department Chief in my office, and now superintendent of schools at Beatrice, and I said, "Burnham, you know how to teach Character Education in the schools unless you attempt to prepare teachers. Seems to me that with about six thousand normal trainers in the state that they should have some introduction to this subject. It seems to me that we should incorporate something about this in your new pamphlet". He looked up at me and said "Taylor, what do you know ahout Character Education", and I said "don't know anything about it separately and apart from the usual activities of the school". I said, "What do you know about it, Burnham" and he said "I don't know anything". I said "The State of Nebraska is in a peculiar situation. Here is the State Superintendent of public instruc - tion and his appointee who don't know anything about this thing. We will not give any publicity to that but we are going to get busy next week. I propose that you and I take lunch together and discuss this matter' 1 . So we got together and talked it over and we came to the </seg>
            <seg id="p415">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION conclusion that because of the shortness of the time we would be com - pelled to select, some. one man in whom we had confidence to do this and in our minds we wanted a man who would have a constructive outlook toward the problems of life. We have in the world today as we have always had certain people who do constructive things and certain peo - ple who do helpful things. They are the ones who make human pro - gress possible. I am not saying that men who 'think negatively are distinctive for criticism, is certainly helpful. But for a background' of Character Education we wanted an individual if we could find one in this state who would take such far reaching hypotheses and build on it even though he might noi treat scientifically all of the points con - cerned and so we selected Professor F. M. Gregg of Nebraska Wesleyan University and started him to work on this task. We finished the work thirty days late, the three of us, producing for that course of study a book of 208 pages. The Legislature had commanded that we have it in the hands of the teachers by September 1 and we did so by October 1. ■ Our first job was | to get at the viewpoint that should be taken; the next problem in starting to work with Professor Gregg was the problem of religious instruction. Bearing in mind that a work of this character that is to be used by all the grades in the public schools from grades one to twelve must cover a wide scope because this law. made an obligatory for Catholics, Methodists, Lutherans, Episcopals, Seven Day Advents all to use this course of study in grades one to twelve. That is required by law. Then this is the first time that by law in Nebraska the State Superintendent has been given control over any part of the High School curriculum. I was interested in that be - cause I know there is much sentiment in Nebraska against too much centralized authority. We had here a law which our Legislature passed giving control over Character Education and placing the power in the hands of one individual. Yet many people are opposed to too much cen - tralization of authority. But ;I want you to notice here is a bill that the Legislature passed giving control of Character Education all over the State to one individual. Now then in this problem of religious instruction, we find there are large religious denominations who believe very definitely that there can be no moral training except through religious instruction. They believe that is the only way you can achieve the kind of Character Education you want. We have spent much time in discussing that with the leaders of those two churches. We are convinced of the sincerity of their view point. Then among other denominations, and I have in mind one of the largest Protestant denominations, we. find a well defined movement to introduce religious instruction in the public schools. Then back of that we have a very strong idea in this country that there shall be no joinder of church and state. In making us this course of study I find that to be a very serious problem and the course must b» one that will not violate the </seg>
            <seg id="p416">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cherished religious ideas of any large part of the people of our com - monwealth. I do not hesitate to say to you that it is my belief that any attempt to inject any religious beliefs into such a course of study is a step toward the union of church and state. It may be a small step, but it is a step, so for the present we are not going to make any attempt to weave religious instruction as such into this course of study Wr have attempted to build a course of study that will not violate any cherished religious beliefs of any church. Without that, do we have enough left to make a course worth while, so we invite the most critical analysis of the vigorous criticism toward this course of study that may be made. We perhaps have made it very general for the simple reason that any definite course of study in Character K.lucation that might be strictly adapted to the schools in Omaha and Linculn might not fit the situation in schools of the small villages in the western part of the state or the rural schools. What might be fitting- for a rural school of thirty-five pupils might not work out at all with a rural school of five pupils. We felt as a department, that all we could do was to lay down a general course of study which any school in any part of the state could use and that we would thus make some progress toward the goal of turning out better citizens than in the past. So far as this is concerned if there has been any implied criticism on the part of the Legislature, I am willing to accept that in good faith. I am now making a plea to my own profession through the various avenues not to misconstrue the action of the Legislature and not to assume any foolish attitude toward the subject, but to join with us in a cooperative fashion to giving more emphasis toward the thing which seems to be very much in the mind of the public at this time, turning out with better character, better citizens from their schools. In correspondence with Milton Fairchild of the National Institute on Character Education, in one of my letters to him I said concerning this law that we will not be able to go far in the development of a Character Education program until we discover some way of testing out what we are goin? to produce. Mr. Fairchild wrote back a very interesting letter of which one paragraph particularly challenged my attention when he says the public is going to put one test on the schools. My ears stood up and my mouth came open as I read what followed: for his next statement was this: that public is going to expect an immediate decrease of our juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime. He said that is the test which the public is going to put on the product of the public schools. Then it took me a minute or two to get my breath. It is that fact perhaps that made me very anxious to come out here and talk to you people today on this subject. I want </seg>
            <seg id="p417">; NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION you men and women to think that over. He means to say that the public schools are held to be responsible at least in part for juvenile deliquency and juvenile crime. Then I began to ask myself the ques - tion, is this the thing which has been going around in the public mind and which all of these articles have been discussing about the schools. Does it mean that we are. going 1 to hold the school and the school alone responsible for the character of the boys and girls who are graduating from our schools. Then I began to search. I went up to the State Library and I said to. the librarian, I want some statistics on juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime. The answer was that they didn't have much except to bring out an old volume of census reports. One of the justices of the Supreme Court heard us. I took the volume but a few minutes later this justice of the Supreme Court came in and laid down a book on my desk being the proceedings of a joint meeting of the Bar' Associations of Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana and which a Prolessor Banks, a great authority on law subjects, had ad - dressed the meeting of this United Bar Association on the meeting of Statistics on Crime and this professor had said among other things that there are no available, dependable statistics on juvenile deliquency and juvenile crime. We do know, men and women, that the ages of criminals have been decreased steadily in the last ten or fifteen years. We do know, that the great majority of criminals in Houses of Cor - rection at the present time are between fifteen and seventeen years of age. We do know that the average age of criminals in the United ■ States is now about twenty-three years of age. We get that from the Federal Census reports, and that is about all we know about juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime. I cannot find any discussions as to the causes of that thing or where the responsibility for that situation should be placed. I was very grateful to the Judge for bringing that volume down. Then I went down to see Mrs. Hornberger, who has done such •wonderful work for years in the juvenile courts of Nebraska. 1 said to her that I am in search of facts on this subject, not opinions but I want facts on juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime. She said there are none. I said, what do you mean, you have been dealing with juvenile delinquency for twenty years and do you mean to say that there is no place that I can get information on this? She said, that is exactly what I mean, il am only interested in boys and girls up to eighteen years of age and she further said that our District Judges, in the State have charge ef juvenile, courts usually hold hear - ings wh\ch are very informal. The Judges hesitate very much to place a written record opposite the name of a boy or girl. They prefer rather to parole that boy or girl to some responsible individual in the community and throw the way! of every safeguard around the boy and girl without making a record which may ultimately follow the boy and girl in after years even if they have reformed and started to live the </seg>
            <seg id="p418">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE rifeht kind of a life. Then she said this to me, if you will talk with any of these men and women who have charge of these reformatories, they will give you one word to explain a large part of the causes of juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime. I said, what is that word and she said it's spelled H-O-M-E. She said, you can go out to the people of the Stale „..&lt;! tv.il Lhv.::i that it is the opinion of those who work with juvenile delinquency that it is the Home as an institution which is falling down rather morn than the schools. Another institution which is falling down is the church, not meaning any particular church. TV thins that is needed is more of the right kind of home life, and nvne of the right kind of religious instruction, and then I began to ■■■■■• the prchl.-m ::.-■ it exists from the standpoint of a course of study in Character I-'.&lt;ucati.;ii. I began to think of the American Home and I began to think of he fact that a child is moldrd in the first five years of its life. We teachers can always tell the first day that a child comes into the school room whether or not it is going to be cooperative with other children and teachers. Many teachers have seen little outlaws the first minute they enter the school room and they never acquire the attitude of cooperative respect for opinions outside of themselves. Then I began to think of the community outside of church work and all that sort of thing. I began to think of the fact that we only have a child in school for six or seven hours of the day. The home, the church and other community institutions have the child for the rest of the time. I began to think of the complex life we are living. The child today knows much more at the age of twelve than young people twenty-five years ago knew at the age of twenty about problems of that kind I thought of the home situation right here in Lincoln which is one of the best citi»s in the world to live in. I think there is no other city quite like Lincoln, the one you live in is second best but the one I live in is best. Even here we have fathers and mothers who will get in their cars and go out to the Orphanage on Sunday afternoons after dinner and take the children out and love them for a little while and give them a ride for two or three hours and then take them back so they can go on about their way of living for the rest of the week. We have many parents who do that. Perhaps that isn't the typical home in Lincoln. I am trying now to talk frankly about some things that have vitally to do with Character Education. I have come to the conclusion in my own mind that we must come back to some of the old fashion things, to the old fashioned home. I wonder where that home has gone at the present time. 1 wonder why it is we don't have more old fashioned homes where the life of the father and mother are predominant factors in the life of the child as it crows up; a home where the father is head of the family.

            <seg id="p420">REI'liltT ul" XKBKASKA STATE IJOAKD OF AGRICL'LTL'RE doesn't believe in the American home as we believe in it. As an illusra - tion of that I call attention to the primary attack on the home made in Russia as soon as the present Socialistic Communistic Regime was established. There are atheists at heart. This Julius family down in Kansas who recently broke into the lime-light with their barnyard mar - riage or two-r-who are they ? He is the man who has been publishing Socialistic obscene or near-obscene literature and atheist literature for years and years. The newspapers don't tell us that. Yet he was played up in the headlines in the barnyard marriage proposition. Among other things, in the few minutes remaining I want to call attention to in this modern life we are living at present is the psychological pressure under which these young people whom we turn c at at such tender age are not able to stand. As I said, the child to - day has much more worldly knowledge at the age of twelve than other young people at twenty but yet the great majority of those turned out are making good, but the problem that we have been discussing are not those just of the majority but are those of the minority. We meet this problem of graduating young children from the High School at the age of thirteen or fourteen years for we have some Freshmen here in the University who are only fifteen years of age. They show too much emotional strain being placed on youth. That is one of the best agreements for the Junior College that can be produced. It is just pro - bable that we will have to evolve in our future development a system . of psychiatric examination. That would weed out some of the sort of cases that is now developed in California. The boy came from such a home. When we go far enough in a medical examination we could perhaps select such people before they graduate from our schools and choose certain individuals who are lacking in poise and balance. It is from such a class that a large part of our criminals come. These young people are not able to stand the stress and strain of this modern life. We may look forward to the time in our state school systems when there will be definitely introduced a system by which we can select groups of young people so inflicted that we will never have to allow them to go out into society without proper restraint. Why should the.^e individuals who cannot control themselves, who want to kill somebody or knock somebody down be allowed to run loose until they commit some terrible crime? I want to say friends, this problem of Character Education is one which is larger than the confines of the school, it touches the home, the church, it touches the community at large. There is the question upon which we school people must ask you citizens to give us every assistance you can. So it is a problem upon which I have been glad to talk to you in this frank way. The Presiding Officer then introduced Dean W. E. Sealock of the Teachers College of the University of Nebraska, who said a few words as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION BY DEAN SEALOCK I am very glad to appear before you today for just a moment. I would like to say in regard to Professor Taylor's address that I agree with everything he said and I might go a little further in one or two things than he went. Personally I am convinced that we can teach Character Education as such. The whole school course must teach Character Education. That is, we must teach it in our arithmetic, in our economics or in whatever subject we are presenting and not just say that we are going to set aside from. 11:30 to J2:00 o'clock in which to teach it. Even more than that we must teach it in the home. We must recognize that in geography, home economics, manual training and all subjects must be built around that. When we do that we are going to begin to solve the problem of Character Educa - tion in the schools. I believe in the law which was passed. I believe a great deal will come from this But we must not think of doing just this one thing and expect to teach it during one certain period of the day. . LEADERSHIP, WHAT IT MEANS W. H, BROKAW, Director Extension Service During the past seven years agriculture has occupied the state as it has never occupied it before. Nearly everyone has had a pet theory of the needs of agriculture and a j plan for righting its wrongs. There have been so many solutions discussed. If you have followed these discussions and have analyzed them and the solutions suggested you will have discerned that there is in the background something un - mentioned but really the heart of the difficulty. This thing which none have mentioned but all have sensed is the lack of leadership. Recognized leadership is an essential of any successful movement, in - dustry or nation, Agriculture has not lacked self admitted leadership nor plans for its welfare but thej recognized leadership which has al - ways been evident in other crises has been wanting. The agriculture of the immediate past has been so busy in producing efficiently that few leaders have been developed and but little thought has been given the future. If agriculture is to be the nation in the future, what it has been in the past, it must keep pace with the other industries. This can be done only by development. Development or growth can only come through competent leaders and these leaders must have a vision. Leadership can only come through 1 study and desire. A study of conditions convinces . one more and more of this lack of leadership. This in turn calls to mind the statement of an eminent </seg>
            <seg id="p422">CiU'ORT OK NEliKASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE authority that whenever a democracy fails to furnish good and suf - ficient leadership, the democracy will quit the stage. This has been the history of the past. It will be the history of the future. With this thought in mind, is it not well to turn our attention to the develop - ment of agricultural leadership. Nor is this a selfish idea for while this leadership is needed for agriculture and community development, from these leaders must come leadership for state and nation. Although suggesting national leadership and recognizing its value, this discussion is intended for community and local leaders. From these local and community leaders must come our state and national leaders and such development is essential. Rarely do we have men or women spring from obscurity to national prominence and while we, at this time perhaps have the most striking example in Lindbergh, years will roll on before another appears. The great mass of leader - ship is developed slowly step by step, and all must have learned first the great underlying principle of leadership — namely that of being a good follower before the opportunity comes to lead. While a study of our great leaders might prove of value, com - munity leaders and their responsibility and achievements is our theme. There is no glamour or mystery and not so many thrills surrounding . community leadership unless you go into their own neighborhood and find out the facts of accomplishments and self-sacrifice that really exist. There is no need of my telling you about local leadership for you can turn back to your own community and tell me more wonderful stories than I can tell you. Yet I can meet with you and come away with a thrill for the things you folks have accomplished in your own community. The things close to home we often do not see. Two persons may walk down the road, one seeing many things worth while, with a beauty that excites and inspires which the other uncon - sciously passes. All because he or she was not attuned toward nature and her beauties. So it is in your own community. When you return look for those things in your community which are up-building, beauti - ful and worthy of mention. I am sure that you folks will do that. I wish to tell you of the things that leadership means and a few of the qualities of leadership. The first is the power of initiative. You say I do not have it. It is not possible for me to think out things for my community. Initiative is an essential quality and we must work to develop it. Too often it is a lack of faith in your own ability. In the beginning do not expect too much. Do the things you see to do and beiore these are accomplished new ideas will come. It is not so much the lack of initiative as it is the power to start — inspiration. This brings us to vision another essential quality.

The development depends wholly upon yourself studying their com - munity with an unselfish attitude: So many of you have already been so successful, as leaders in your community, I know you have the vision and the ability. _ The following quotation has! been an inspiration to me and the things which you are doing as leaders prompts me to use it at this time: ■ ■ m o/' I lA be !u Cr T 4 t0 Uve tha " not t0 serve; for onI y fa y carrying more of the threads of fine human endeavor to the loom of life than one takes away of the fabric that has been woven by the unselfish toil ol others, can one be an asset instead of a liability to society. » .

I wish it might be possible to recognize in this state all of the leaders who are doing things. This morning we meet to honor those who have carried forward one type of service. As we look over the work of ten years and the Agricultural Extension Service, I don't know how it would be possible to recognize all of the leaders who have served on county boards and who are backing up all these projects. We have men and women on the County Boards of the Farms Bureaus who have done a wonderful service. I wish I could tell you something about that service but the ones who we are talking about this morning mainly are those who have been carrying out your project work. So this recognition of service is taken today for those who have taken charge of Home Economics demonstration projects from the County standpoint. Now I am going to read you the names of those who have been County Chairmen of the Home Demonstration Projects and to those who are here at this time, I will further address myself.

Your friends and neighbors have chosen you county chairman of home demonstration project work.) They believe you to possess that ability to. serve and that spirit of self sacrifice so necessary for suc - cessful leaderhip.

            <seg id="p426">\EPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Your selection was an honor and privilege, but it also implied duties to perform and obligations to fill. Your regular duties have not prevented your meeting these tasks and we recognize that only busy people are successful leaders. By a faithful performance of your duties, you have inspired a confidence in you and a friendship for you that can only be secured by having been a friend to others and by a faithful performance of . obligations assumed. One is not worthily a leader who is not doing all in her power to enlighten her community by becoming, in so far as humanly possible, an example of right living and service to others. While the work you have done and the goals achieved are highly commendable, you have but entered into this field of leadership so es - sential to Agriculture's welfare and to National progress. Others may assume in the coming years your tasks of the present, but leader - ship accomplishments imply growth of the individual and point the way to broader fields. Do not misunderstand, that no field, appearing to many a higher field or greater accomplishment, is more essential than the one you are filling now. Your community, your county, your state, the nation, are observing: the character of your service. They will expect much of you and in this we are sure they will not be disappointed for into the hearts of all human there has been implanted, and it depends only upon proper cultivation for growth, that desire for leadership so essential to an oc - cupation such as ours and to the welfare of a Christian Nation. I now wish to present to you this the token of appreciation from the Home Economics Association of Organized Agriculture •which you have earned as leaders of the Home Demonstration Project Work, (presenting to each one a little pin with H.

HOLLAND of St. Paul, Minneapolis Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to me to come here and learn something from your program and catch a little of your spirit, and to sort of measure your purpose. You are working toward what we are trying to accomplish in America, the production of a race of boys and girls through the efforts of you who are trying to raise the standards of leadership a little higher than we have it. When I was sent this topic I almost wished I had been born a woman instead of a man so that I could view the work of the household from -the more active rather than the passive end of the business as a mere man. </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA HOME|_ ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ■ ■ . ■ ■ ' ■ t" ■ I want to approach the subject of the Home Makers Ideals a little differently than some of those who have been on the program and perhaps a little differently , from what it is stated as my topic. I want to talk to you of the rights of those who cannot speak or fight for themselves. A few months ago I stood at the place where the soldiers made King John of England in 1915 grant what they called a Bill of Rights. Up to that time man had had no rights except those delegated to them by those who were supposed to have them all. That struggle went on until about 1776, that only date in American history that I can always remember. In that time human rights and human government pushed ahead in other step. Our great American Govern - ment launched forth on its mission toward an end that yet worries some pessimist. A pessimist is one who worries about the hole while he eats the doughnut. About 1840 a noted authority found that there were .not yet very extensive woman's rights and that in that time there were just seven things that, a woman could do including home -work, nursing, and teaching. . Then began a period of progress toward wom - an's rights. Then there were only three higher educational institutions open to women. About that time a group of women said we must advance woman's rights. From that time on we men have seen our castles crumble until now there are only about five professions in which women can not star along with their fathers and brothers of a family. There are now some six hundred vocations in life in which a woman can earn her living, there being even women blacksmiths, and mechanics and garage workers. But those are not the ones of whom I want particularly to speak. I want to lift my voice in behalf of the children and of children's rights. They cannot plead W themselves. They accept life as we would from the hands of God without being consulted as to its quality or its quantity. They have to make. their way in the world and accept things as given to them by somebody else. In a general way, all of you- people here will agree with what I say. As I go on I believe I can point out the rights of the child more clearly. This is still pretty much a pioneer work. I am putting what I have to say in an alliterate scheme so it will be easy to remember and you can take it back to your community. In the first place, the child has a right to be WELL BRED. We grant that to a calf, we grant it to a chicken, we grant it to a colt, in fact we grant it to everything and everybody but children. I know it is a touching subject. I know myself, many children who are damned into this world instead of born into it. We know that we cannot get well bred stock without providing it with a good origin. That is the only way to lift up the production of any stock through careful selec - tion. We are hot going to get it through the barnyard marriage as it </seg>
            <seg id="p428">IEPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE was expressed a while apo. Children had better never be born into the world than be born under handicaps which might have been prevented had society taken in hand the great eugenic processes of human life. It seems that God Almighty has arranged the world so that we come into it heart first instead of head first. We have to make two great decisions in life without any science, pick out what we are going to do in the world and who we are going to live with. We just jump into those heart first. That is the denned plan. It would be so much better if those who have learned by experience a correct philosophy of life could somehow take a hand in this great question. At that we will not revolutionize the world in one, two or ten generations, but processes can be reached by which the human family can be improved ir. physical conditions, increased in moral vivacity, and secure a greater vision of soul. When I went up from a little town near Chicago to be the pastor of a great church, I found a girl whom I had known a long time. I knew of her marriage and I met her in that city and I said, I want you, Helen, and Bill to come over to the church and her eyes filled with tears. 1 said, I am sorry that things haven't gone for the best, some times singleness is bliss and marriage is not bliss, and I wanted to know what the trouble was. She opened a little door to a room and on a couch lay a little baby, a mass of sores from head to foot. I didn't say any more and she said no more. The poor little baby was damned into the world and fortunately for all concerned, it passed away in a few weeks. That is only one phase. That is the physical phase. I talked recently with Dr. Kuhlman -of St. Paul whose wife attends my church. He has charge of the examination of many little children who are confined in a Feeble Minded Institution many of whom are of that class who will always remain about twelve years old as long as they live. He tells me that class is increasing in the State of Minne - sota. We wouldn't let that happen in the barnyard and we wouldn't let it happen anywhere else than in the human family. We haven't tackled the problem with our head as much as with our sentiments. Second, a child, has another right. The right to be WELL FED. When Lincoln Strauss in New York City took up the campaign for milk for children everybody hearlded him as a great leader for thau - sands of little children began to grow bigger and more vigorous when they got milk. But everybody thought the problem of malnutrition was confined to the towns and cities. But just outside of the edge of St. Paul and Minneapolis in a dairy county in Wisconsin they put on the campaign and fouid some thousands of malnutrition children in that county. Now we have improved vastly on the right to a child in being well fed. But with all that improvement and with all the scientific as - sistance and with all the culture in the human family, this very day </seg>
            <seg id="p429">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION one-third of the children in the world are being either improperly fed, under fed, or not fed at all. I venture you can find people who are within five miles of your home, wherever you live you can find families too ignorant to feed their own children properly. I have found them within three blocks of my own church in the city. We want to impress this idea that the child has a right to be well fed. A child has the right to be WELL-READ. I grew up as you probably did up until the coming of the war thinking that everybody in America could read and write and that we were a perfectly mar - velous country. I went to Camp Dodge at Des Moines during the ter - rible world war where they were training boys from our section of the country and training them in the processes of killing; and I saw a group of four hundred fellows from my sovereign state of Minnesota stand up in line to learn their A-B-C's, and learn to read and write. They were the children of Finnish mothers and. Hungarian mothers. We found a little over two hundred thousand of those boys from more than a mil - lion get together who could not read and write the American language. Somebody had slipped. They were denied their original right to be well read. &gt;. . I have been looking over the High School buildings of this city. I looked over the schools of a town in the state of Iowa where I dis - covered America at once. Some people say that we are spending too much for education. "We are not spending as much for education in this country each year as we spend for cigarettes even at the dis - comfort of the tightwad tax payer. We should not shut down on those things until we spend as much for such things as we do for the lux - uries we burn up. That may be dreaming. The right to be WELL READ doesn't mean that everybody has to - read Latin or Greek or such but it means that every child should have, a right to a particular type of preparation for life; every child should be trained to do what he can do best, most efficiently, and most happily. Let's see what the average American home is now. Father is sitting at a little stand that he has set up to see how many stations he can get. Mother is reading a magazine or knitting. Daughter is reading the Black Cat Stories and Son is working the cross word puz - zle: That is the culture we find today. Perhaps that isn't true out here in Nebraska because you have about the highest average of culture of any state along with Kansas and South Dakota. I am pleading for an education. I think it was James Russell Lowell who said the American Constitution was written by the scholars of its day and if it ever becomes interpreted by any one not the scholars of their day the fabric of the American public would crumble. I went out into the country yesterday afternoon to see a woman whom I had known </seg>
            <seg id="p430">lEI'OUT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE as a girl. I find their monetary condition has not been such for that family as they would desire but she has moved up close to this town of colleges and culture because she said, I am going to see that my children get a chance. Not very long ago I was in a factory where I saw some boys and girls whom I felt sure were under the school ag-e and were not by law allowed to work in factories at that age. I asked the Superintendent how old they were and he said, it is none of your damn business. I made up my mind it was and I went and found out how old these children were and also found out that their parents had lied as to their age, that some of them had been taken out of school at twelve or thirteen years of age. Men were going to coin money out of their ignorance. These children are now getting some education, but I am told that their parents kicked against the interference with their business but those children with my child have the right to a com - mon knowledge and a common culture. It is their right. If the home doesn't see to it who is going to do it? I don't know, but the whole thing comes back to the home. A child has another right, the right to be WELL LED. You will say now, preacher, I knew you would come to that. I was in the Alps Mountains and there was a lady there from the South; who had a child with a group of other people. As we were coming down off a glacier the little child called out, "Don't step so long, I can't keep up with your steps." That child expressed the whole philosophy of life. The child has the right to be well led. When listening a while ago to the excellent man at the head of your educational system to a lot of the things he said, in my heart I said 0. K. When it came down to our own child my wife and I looked down the years and thought we could have her for our very own. When she was four years old she started to kindergarten and since then she has belonged to somebody else for about half of the " j time. I suppose some younp; dude will foreclose on her in a little while just like 1 did on her mother. I remember a book by a psychologist of Harvard University who said that we don't have any changes in the bent of our character after we are six years old in other words our likes and dislikes are practically established but by that time we will like red or blue when we are six or we like a certain class of people and dislike others when we are six years of age and will hardly ever change those likes after that. I know that a child learns obedience at the time it is six years old or it will go out a law breaker and without respect for any authority unless it learns it there. I think it was Mark Twain who said there is just as much Government in the home now as there used to be but it has changed hand*. It has heon said that a crook is somebody who wasn't- told to fro straight early enough in life. I would rather had never been </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION' born than to have been born as I know some children are born, but 1 am glad. I had a Christian father and mother who sometimes taught me by warming up the northwest corner of my anatomy by the lay - ing on of Apostolic hands. When I thought I knew more than they did they taught me the lesson of obedience. That's the first thin*- I ever learned and if I hadn't learned it there I possibly would W never learned it at all. Judge Orr of the Municipal Court of St Paul with whom I took lunch has spent twenty-five years on that bench and he said to me when I told him 1 was coming down here. Doctor, say this to them for me: That we are never going to have a better civilization in this country until we have a home life that assumes the responsibility of guaranteeing every child as far as possible its fundamental right to learn obedience to authority while young I wonder if he. is right or wrong. I think he is right. ■ right the child has is to be WELL WED. I know some of the pl am old people who are talking now kicked up their heels' tiien. It , s natural for young people to kick up their heels but they ZTT V\ ? Wr ° ng tim? - l WOnder if we as AnerieZ - people haven't left too much to chance in the mating of men and women in this world. I wonder if we have realized that every child has the right to be well-wed. Over in some of the pagan or less civilized countries, the father and mother take a little interest in the* way their children marry, who they shall marry and how they shall Not long ago I refused to marry a couple and they were not divorcees either. I just didn't' like the looks of them. You might say that isn't any of my business for- they, can look like they want to' but I refused to marry them. Upon- asking them, I found that she had known this man but five hours. That girl began to think and she ooked over and said, Dear, let's put it off a little longer. She had known him five hours, she met him at a dance at seven o'clock and came at five minutes to twelve to be married. When you sow such stuff you are going to reap the whirlwind. They waited until the next day and her mother got in her oar. That wedding wa« Tiever consummated. Much to the happiness of the girl it developed that young skunk had a wife and child in a town in Wisconsin. Why even my daughter, eighteen years old, has a right to know what she mav expect in the way of obligation and training for the coronation of womanhood which is motherhood. Why should not a young man be taught those beautiful obligations? I know that is in the clouds but we are going, to get awfully deep in the mud if we don't keep up in the clouds.

Some men suggest that this is going too much to the emotional nature of children. I ' think we are going to have to do it soon. We are going to dehorn some of this movie stuff. Either we are going to cut out some of this stuff or else we are going to throw up our hands when a young fellow in California takes a girl and practices what he sees on the films. If we are going to have a better race in the future we will have to bring some of these things about. Emerson says that if you want a thing brought about you have to have people talk about it or in other words there has to be a certain amount of talk in order to get things done* You're talking in this Home Economics program about crop produc - tion that is most important, that is the prppogation of the human family under natural safeguards. In that way we must raise our civilization or our civilization will go down. John Brown had a little dairy and John Brown had a son and a daughter who went to the district school and finally to the High School. Commencement time came and mother got her new dress and everybody got ready and the boy manicured his nails and the parents went in to see their children graduate from High School. Mother in - structed father that no matter what happened he was to keep still. The parents watched John and Mary and thought of the long years they had worked together and their hearts filled with pride. John was the Valedictorian and Mary had some little part in the music. Now the old man's heart came up like a super-goiter as John came on to deliver his address and he could not keep still any longer and he leaned over and in a whisper that could be heard all over the hall, he said, "I guess that is the best crop we ever raised." I believe that is our goal, the production of a better race, the training of a better race, the leadership of a better race which the wise Creator lias put into our hands. </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA HOUR ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION" PART II Mother Vacation Camps The past three years, the Nebraska Home Economics Association has helped to finance speakers for Mothers Vacation Camps. These camps are a real vacation for the mothers who attend— three days of recreation, inspiration, stunts, fun and visiting. After breakfast, in - stead of the hustle and hurry to get dishes washed, chickens' fed and the bread kneaded, the women have the pleasure to sit and talk with. other mothers, listen to worthwhile music, etc. Such programs cheer up. the women, broadens their view point, and helps to make them better citizens in their communities. . Speakers which the Home Economics Association made possible to assist in the camp programs were as follows: Miss Margaret Cleland— Instructor Primary Department, Lincoln City Schools Mrs. CO. Bruce— Lincoln Mrs. E. W. Johnson— Omaha t Through the discussions lead by these leaders' the women decided that every homemaker should have a hobby as these help to broaden life and make it more worthwhile. The discussion on civics helped to interest the women in and to be more familiar with our own state laws, courts and institutions. Such discussions give women the opportunity to become more intelligent citi - zens. Under, the discussion of character building the women brought out that each mother must know her children. This may be done through: . (1) Scientific study. (2) Reminiscence. (3) Observation of other children. (4) Study of inheritance, environment, home, schools, churches, teachers, etc. </seg>

            <seg id="p439">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION PART III 4-H Club Project The Nebraska Home Economics Association. is interested in train - ing girls to be happy successful homemakers. The Association realizes that through the • 4-H girls clubs a splendid piece of work is being done toward giving early training to 4-H club girls in approved stan - dards for the home and the responsibilities of home making. In recog - nition of this most worth while piece of work and to encourage the girls, the Association gave one hundred dollars for the promotion of the Home Economics judging contests. The aim of the judging contests is to establish and recognize stan - dards and to enable the girls to carry the characteristics of high stan - dards in their memory. In these contests the girls place the articles and then give reasons for their placings. Judging contests are held in the counties and then state wide con - tests are held at the State Fair. The money from the Home Econom - ics Association was used to send the high ranking clothing girl and. the high ranking food girl to the Sixth National Boys and Girls Club Congress which was held in Chicago. At this congress the girls en - tered contests in which all the states were represented. The following letters gives some idea of the value of such a trip. . . Blue Hill, Nebraska, December 7, 1927. Miss Florence Atwood, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Miss Atwood: I wish' to thank, the Nebraska State Home Economics Association for the money given me for my trip to the Sixth National Club Girls and Boys Congress at Chicago. I am enclosing a story of my trip. Again thanking you kindly. Rosie Varricka. My Trip to the Sixth National Boys and Girls Club Congress Leaving Blue Hill, Saturday, November 26, at 10:09, myself and Miss Rachel Overing of Red Cloud began our journey to Chicago when we were to compete in the International Livestock Exposition. We were joined at Lincoln by our Club leaders, Mr. Frisbie and Miss Cameron. Other 4-H club members joined the group along the way until nearly all the members were together in Omaha. From there some of the club folks transferred to the Northwestern railroad and to the Rock Island as those two branches offered trips to various winners in the state contest. </seg>
            <seg id="p440">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Our first meal in Chicago was eaten at the Northwestern depot on Sunday morning, where we were joined by the members traveling on the Rock Island. Then we retired to our rooms at Hotel La Salle. The Nebraska delegation attended church services Sunday morn - ing at Central Church. The services were broadcasted over radio. The afternoon was spent taking a special bus trip through the Chicago Park System. Some of the interesting things observed on this trip were the Soldiers and Sailors' Field where the Dempsey-Tunney fight was staged last October. There is a space there for the parking of 45,000 cars. The Morrison Hotel, which towers upward for. forty-two stories, arrested our attention for some time. The mammoth building that houses the Wrigley Chewing Gum factory was another interesting spectacle, as was the building of the Jap Rose Soap factory. Monday dawned a rainy day but that did not dampen our spirits. Breakfast was served to us at Hotel La Salle, after which we made our first visit to the International Livestock Show. At 9:45 both Miss Overing and myself entered the Girls Home Economics Judging Con - test. As I was in the clothing judging with Miss Eleanor Dixon of Blair, Nebraska as my teammate, we started to judge the six classes that were assigned to each of the contestants. Points were given for judging the texture, neatness, style suitable for the individual and occasion. Reasons were given on three classes and each judge had one class. The afternoon was given over to completing the judging. At 7:30 that evening, a special entertainment was held in the Wil - son Auditorium for all the club folks. Miss Dixon and I were asked to leave the parade and enter a decorated wagon which was drawn by six shining black horses. This was to honor us as the champon team in clothing judging in the nation. Other teams who rode with us were the winners of the canning, baking and livestock judging. We were taken to the Arena of the International Amphitheatre where the club folks were assembled. We were introduced and then cheered by our fellow club folks. Tuesday morning we were taken to the Armour building where breakfast was served. The Nebraska delegation then had their pic - tures taken. We had the experience of dining in Hotel Morrison, which, as said before, is the largest hotel in Chicago. The dinner was given by the National Livestock Producers Association. In the afternoon the boys went to the Field Museum, while the girls spent their time at the Art Institute. The original painting of "Song of the Lark" was one of the most beautiful pictures we saw. Quite an unusual thing to us was the furniture brought from Holland, England, Spain and many other foreign countries which was collected through the different ages. </seg>
            <seg id="p441">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The club members own banquet and annual rally was held that evening in the Grand Ball room of Sherman hotel. Among the inter - esting people who talked to us were Doctor C. B. Smithe of the U. S. Department of Agriculture; J. C. Penny, and Mary Hastings Bradley, famous woman African explorer. The girls and boys were , given different places to. visit on Wednes - day. Our group went first to the supply house of Montgomery Ward &amp; Company where we were served breakfast. We ti'.en had a bene - ficial tour through the North Western Yeast Company and learned how to make yeast. While | we were going through these places the boys went, through" the Corn Refining Company at Argo, Illinois. Lunch was served the girls by Marshall Field &amp; Company and we were shown through that company's supply house. After lunch we attr.mle-l the special matinee Horse Show at which prize winning horses of the United States were on exhibition. The National 4-H Club party was held at Hotel La Salle that everting when a health talk- was given by Dr. Carolyn Hedger. The health Champions were present at the party. The evening was given over to games and music. Thursday, our last day at the International Exposition, was the most enjoyable of all days. Our trip through the International Har - vester Company was very educational. We watched the making of tractors from start to finish. One hundred and twenty tractors are turned out by this company in a day. Lunch was served by the In - ternational Harvester Company. At Lincoln Park we saw birds, boats, and animals which made an attractive display. After our Wd through the park we went to Hotel La Salle for our final banmiet. where we were guests of ten different branches of railroads in the United States. We. left Chicago at 10:30 that evoninc: for our return trip. Snow was falling when we left Chicago, but when we reached Nebraska idea', weather prevailed. I certainly enjoyed this trip and got very much knowledge from it. By Rosie Varricka. .■■.'■-■ ' ■ ... " .. ■ . ; ; . j * - ..■■'■ ' ■ . </seg>

It certainly was a worth-while trip and I appreciate the kindness of the Home Economics Association. I am enclosing a re - port of my trip. Yours respectfully, Rachel Overing. The Four-H Club Congress in Chicago The week of November 25 to December 2 witnessed the gather - ing of about 1150 boys and girls, representing 605,000 4-H club mem - bers in the annual club Congress in Chicago. Delegations were sent from forty-four states and Ontario. There were forty from Nebraska. The Nebraska delegation left in two groups, one over the Rock Island railroad and one over the Northwestern. The one leaving from Omaha, of which I was a member, left Saturday evening in a special Pullman and arrived in Chicago Sunday morning. Mr. Frisbie, Mr. Lawrence and Miss Cameron were on our train. Our first glimpse of Chicago was at dawn. Tall buildings rose up to meet a cloudy and smoky sky; there were street cars attached together like trains; and electric signs were flashing in front of the store windows. Nebraska's official headquarters for the week were at the La Salle Hotel. It was here that we slept and where we met before going on our trips. We also registered for our badges and bought our banquet tickets here. After registering, the Protestants marched in a body to Central Church at Orchestra Hall and the Catholics went to St. Mary's. That afternoon we took a special bus trip through Chicago — forty miles without leaving the city. Some of the things we saw were Lake Michigan's white-foamed gray waves stretching far out of sight and dotted with ships streaming shining water behind them; the </seg>

Most of the next day was spent in contests by those who entered them and trips through the International by the rest. Sears and Roe - buck gave a barbecue at noon. In the evening Wilson and Company gave us an entertainment and dinner, after which we paraded around the arena at the Exposition grounds with the winning judges in a wagon at our head. After breakfast at Armour's Tuesday morning the Nebraska dele - gation had its picture taken in front of the . 4-H club building. The : whole congress was given luncheon by the National Livestock Pro - ducer's Association at the Morrison Hotel. In the afternoon the boys went to the Field Museum and the girls to_ the Art Institute. We saw original paintings, statues, china, tapestry, and English, French and Gothic . rooms. One centuries-old English room had been brought piece by piece from its original setting and reconstructed. In the evening we attended the annual banquet and rally at the • Sherman Hotel. Among the unusual features of the program were an illustrated talk by Mary Hastings. Bradley, the African explorer; a harmonica virtuoso, and the Pullman Porter Quartet. The style show and health contest winners were also ' presented this evening and sev - eral close-ups were taken with movie cameras. Wednesday the girls visited Mongomery Ward's, the Northwestern Yeast Company, and Marshal Field's retail store. In the afternoon everybody went to a special matinee horse show at the Exposition grounds. In the evening there was a 4-H club party on the nineteenth floor of the La Salle Hotel. The International' Harvester Company, who were our hosts Thurs - day morning, showed us how they manufacture tractors and binder twine and" also displayed their many varieties of farm implements and trucks. In the factory we saw vats of white-hot molten steel flash sparks as they -were emptied into heavy buckets; we saw them pound heat-softened steel into, shape by the use of immense hammers and molds; arid we saw electromagnets carry hundreds of pounds of iron. Lincoln Park was the scene of our afternoon visit. There were lions, monkeys, and birds indoors as well as all kind of living things outside in places resembling their natural habitat.

After which "Love's Old Sweet Song", and "Juniata" were sung by Mrs. Ahrens, Mrs. Burgess, and Mrs. Hodgkins, with Mrs. Tobin at the piano. The chairman gave an appropriate talk in her greetings which opened the meeting. This was followed by a helpful discussion given by Mrs. Elmer KahJ of Sidney, Nebraska. She was the District President of the Parent Teachers' Association. In her talk she said if we would invest our time in the development of our children as well as in the development of crops and livestock, our return will be not only dollars and cents but in joy and happiness. Mrs. Kahl advocated Rood reading matter in the house and advised doing away with literature that harms children morally. If we wish to have a happy heart, do something for the neglected child; if we help in this work we are helping to prevent delinquency in children. She stated that the membership of the Parent Teacher's Association in 1920 was 200,000; in 1926 it was 1,000,000; while in 1927 it was 1,300 000. Ne - braska has 15,193 of these members. </seg>
            <seg id="p445">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Miss Nellie Williams, of the Public Library Commission of Lin - coln, gave an interesting talk on "What Shall Our Children Read?" Miss Williams had with her a large special collection of books for children, which she brought from the library. These were a perfectly lovely group for us to come in contact with. Miss Williams advised fairy tales for children as they help to broaden a child's imagination. Many good books of fifty years ago are the same books we are read - ing and talking about today. .1 Miss Margaret Cleland, of Lincoln, who has assisted with the Mothers' Vacation Camps, gave, a talk on the topic, "Mothers, Do ' You Have a Hobby?" A hobby is a subject or plan in which one may become interested and which will detract attention from our daily tasks. A hobby may be a pastime, an amusement, and a recre - ation. It should be kept bridled so we may be able to make the most of it. Following Miss Cleland's talk she had a round table , discussion. The women present reported enjoying a variety of hobbies, such as: committing poetry, enjoying music, making scrap books, taking care of children and keeping them well, making the home convenient with the least expense and tending flowers and gardens. Following the discus - sion each lady arose and told her name and address. ' Afternoon Session — Dec. 8, 1927 The president, Mrs. Bluhm, called the meeting to order, after which music was furnished by Mrs. Clarence Johnson, of Potter, and Mrs. J. F. Calloway, of Kimball, with Mrs. Place at the piano. Mrs. A, R. Leavitt, of North Platte, was to be the next on the program, as her train was late Miss Mary Ellen Brown, State Home Demonstration Leader, of Lincoln, spoke on "The Type of Old Ladies We Wish to Become", until Mrs. Leavitt arrived. Miss Brown drew an imaginary picture of two women, one being a woman with a strong, pleasing personality, and the other one being just the opposite. Pic - tures of these two women had been used in a lesson with girls which was called "Now and 50 Years From Now". The girls had named the two women Mrs. Glad and Mrs. Worry. The girls decided that Mrs. Glad was. kind, thoughtful, nelpful, honest when she was a jitl. She had not waited until she was 50 years old before she began to be a Mrs. Glad; instead, what we are today determines what we will be later in life. Miss Brown gave a cure for the blues — that of getting busy and doing something for someone else. She also talked about the word that would describe our homes. • She said we all wanted to have our homes comfortable and satisfying. ■ ■ ■ ■ ' ' '■• ' ' t </seg>

She gave several good illustrations. </seg>

At the business meeting a suggested constitution was read by the secretary. A motion was made that it be adopted; this was seconded and the motion was carried. The report of the nominating committee was read and a motion was made and carried that it be adopted. Mrs. C.J.' Royal, of Crawford, was elected president; Mrs. E. H. Bluhm, Sunol, vice-president. The Secretary-treasurer is to be the County Home Demonstration Project chairman if the next meeting is held in ■ an organized county. \ ' ■ ' . Following the business meeting Rev. L. H. Knub, of Sidney, spoke on the topic, "A Woman's Civic Responsibility". Rev. Kaub stated that out true debt to womanhood has never been ascertained. Where men become famous, back of each) is a woman— a mother who had more to do with the placing of that individual than the public has had. Who trained these men who signed the Declaration of Independence"? It came from the teachings of a woman, a mother. "The hand that rocks the cradle Is the hand that rocks the world." No nation can ever rise higher than its- motherhood. A mother's in fluence is tremendously more than that of a father, but back of it all is the Home. We can get along without the church, even the school, or any institution, but never without the Home; therefore a woman's civic responsibility is to train children into the right kind of citizenship. In closing the morning session the members of the advisory'com - mittee gave short talks, responding to the topic, "What Shall We Take Home From This Meeting?" Friday afternoon there . was one general meeting for men and women. Mrs. C. J. Royal Secretary CONSTITUTION OF HOME ECONOMICS SECTION Article I.

            <seg id="p457">PROCEEDINGS OF THE Nebraska State Horticultural Society TUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION • - JANUARY 3, 1928 The fifty-ninth annual convention of the Nebraska Horticultural Society met m Room 106 of the Plant Industry Building of the Agri - cultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska, on Tuesday afternoon, January 3, 1.928, and was called to order at two o'clock by the President, Mr J. ' R. Davidson, of Aurora. THE PRESIDENT: The first subject is "roadside Markets for Vegetables." In the absence of Mr. Haber, who is unable to be with us, the topic will be discussed by Mr. C. V. Holsinger, of the Agri - cultural College, Ames, lowa. "SELLING VEGETABLES AT ROADSIDE MARKETS" MR. C. V. HOLSINGER, Ames, lowa This kind of work does not fit into the subject of roadside market - ing as some other phases, like fruit or melons. With the advent of good roads and better automobiles, residents of the city are now very much inclined to drive long distances. Most of them are out for pleasure. Their demands are, as a rule, for things other than neces - sities. You will find cars parked about roadhouses, where oftentimes other things than chicken dinners are served. During the late summer and fall . m our neighborhood, quite a few roadside markets ; are maintained. The products offered for sale m the vegetable line are largely the non-perishable kind like potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, and onions. Of course some more perishable products are offered such as tomatoes, peppers, etc. The point that I wish to make is this, that the traveling public </seg>
            <seg id="p458">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGKICULTURE is more interested in stopping at a melon stand or at one where a basket of fniit can be had, something to be consumed at the stand or on the way in the car. Only a relatively small amount of the products of this kind purchased are taken home for subsequent consumption. Of course it is true that some folks use the idea of marketing in this way as an alibi to cover up an excuse for driving to the country. Frankly, I do not know any of our enterprising vegetable growers who maintain a roadside market. Our growers find that the growing of vegetables requires most of their time. The retailing* is left to another group. . '. In our neigh orhood, melon stands are very much in e f ' : 'ience. One man in particular has pone to considerable expense to decorate his place. In a single season, he has taken 8000 dollars from the sale of his melons. He grew most of these himself. Later on he had his troubles in the growing of melons and had to purchase quite a little of the stock he sells. This is the way a large part of the roadside markets end. In a recent 5000 mile trip by auto, we had occasion to make some observations along this line. We saw hundreds of stands or places where many things could be purchased, but green vegetables were not among the number of things offered for sale, with only a few exceptions. Fruit, such as blueberries, blackberries and cherries were to be had, but only in limited quantities. On the other hand, I know quite a few fruit growers that have been very successful in selling their crop, if not in this way, at least they were able to sell at the farm. Two of them that I have in mind sold more than $10,000 each last fall. Apples were scarce and folks desiring fruit for winter use drove in some cases as much as 100 miles to lay in a supply. One of the most enterprising of these people has put signs 20 to 30 miles distant from the farm. His fruit will run almost 10091 worm free and has built up a good trade. In this case, the buyers are looking for a supply of fruit for future use. Duplications to a certain degree of the above, can bo found in many parts of Iowa. THE PRESIDENT: If there are no questions, the next number is "New Developments in Vegetable Production," by Mr. H. O. Werner. i i </seg>
            <seg id="p459">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY •i :•••'■ "NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN VEGETABLES" H. 0. WERNER, Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska Members of the Horticultural Society: In discussing the subject assigned me this afternoon, I shall endeavor, instead of giving an exhaustive exposition on any one subject, rather to give you a little information on some new knowledge which has developed in vegetable production within the last few years as the results of experimental worjc, new discoveries which are of interest to you as vegetable gardeners. It is quite possible that the best way to get at this ques - tion would be to handle it as a discussion proposition. If you are . interested in some one phase of it, it will be proper to bring that up later on. To me, one of the most interesting developments which is occur - ring at the present time is the development of new varieties of toma - toes for early production. Quite a number, of years ago, two brothers in the northern part of New York were producing tomatoes for the cottagers who went up into the Adirondack Mountains. The earliest varieties they could get were not quite early enough. They went to the trouble to select their tomato seed from the earliest tomatoes, and gradually they found this was not the best way; then they saved the seed from the plants which produced the early tomatoes. About fifteen years ago they had a distinctly early strain. They found that soon they were growing, tomato seed rather than tomatoes, because they could sell the seed at five dollars an vmnce, and could not pro - duce enough to supply the demand. That strain became famous the country over. The North Dakota Experiment Station tried out this strain in comparison with others and ten years ago found it to be very early. They saved seed from some vwry early plants out of that strain and improved this strain still further. The most recent development out of the North Dakota work has occurred within fhe last year. After five years of selection, they were not makiner any progress, i They had made all the progress by selection they could make. Then they endeavored to procure greater earliness, and perhaps improvement in quality, by crossing this Earliana with another variety. They used a small English variety by the name of "Sunrise" — producing tomatoes about one and one-half inches in diame - ter. (The "Comet" is a similar variety, and another is the "Victoria.") They crossed this North Dakota selection with the "Sunrise." They made certain selections and got two varieties. One of these is the "Red River," named after the region where in it was produced; and the other is the "Agassiz." The "Red River" is an extremely early variety. It has many characteristics of the "Earliana," and is very desirable. </seg>
            <seg id="p460">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There is something better on the way. This year the North Dakota Station has sent to different experiment stations tomato seed of an entirely new type. For several years the Burpee Company of Philadelphia has put out a tomato which does not develop strong shoots in the axils of the leaves and does not do as much branching as the average variety. It has the habit of apparently ceasing to grow at the proper time consequently preventing the development of vine, and avoiding the trouble -we find so common of having the tomatoes going all to vines. It is self -pruning and is a pink variety of the "Globe" type. It is quite productive in our gardens. It is called "Self Prun - ing." This self-pruning variety was crossed with the "Red River," which was a cross between the North Dakota selection of the "Earliana" and tho "Sunrise." From that they have an early type of tomato which is very much earlier than the "Earliana" and having the characteristics of the Self-Pruning variety. The statement was made at a meeting of the American Society for Horticultural Science at Nashville last week, that in North Dakota they have had individual tomato plants producing forty pounds of tomatoes. Up to any one certain date — like the first of August — this new variety or varieties will produce anywhere from five to ten times as much as the ordinary commercial types of "Earliana." The seed probably will not be available for commercial gardeners until the summer of 1929. Some other work which has been done on tomatoes on pruning and staking may be of interest. There has been quite a controversy as to the merits or demerits of the practice. The Ohio Experiment Station and the one at Cornell are agreed that earliness can be in - creased by pruning and staking and that we can thereby get larger fruits and avoid stem rotting, although the ordinary tip rot of the tomato is worse when pruned and staked. In some cases the gains are remarkably good. This matter needs to be considered from the standpoint of early tomatoes and from the standpoint of getting the fruit off the ground in a wet season. Another variety of tomato which is new and probably worthy of a trial is the Marglobe. I do not have the history of this tomato on hand. It is a variety developed by the Department of Agriculture for getting wilt resistance. Wilt is a serious problem in the south. This variety has many of the characteristics of the Globe, but it is a red tomato, and quite meaty, with good carrying qualities. I am told the frnit remains of uniform size throughout the season. They do not produce a few pickings of good tomatoes, with the rest of the pickings poor ones. The tomatoes are constantly uniform. In Missouri they </seg>
            <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA STATIC HORTICULTURE- SOCIETY consider it the most desirable of all their midseason varieties. We have tried it here, not on as extensive scale as we should like, hut suf - ficiently to realize that it is a good tomato with considerable improve - ment over other tomatoes of its class. I might mention both the "Red River" and this new group of varieties produce relatively little seed, and consequently some seedsmen are not enthusiastic about them. The canner- and the home user find them desirable. They are relatively solid tomatoes, which is very much to be desired. In connection with some of. the ' work at the Experiment Station here during the last few years, we have concluded, that although irri - gation is not considered necessary for tomatoes, perhaps in our latitude the commercial grower can afford to install a system of overhead or surface irrigation (the latter if he can operate a centrifugal pump). In the season of 1926 we got increased yields — not double, but as much as eight and ten times the yield— from irrigated plants we did from unirrigated plants. "When using irrigation, one must see to it that the plants grow constantly and that you do not force them to much, or one may be forcing vegetative growth at the expense of fruit deve - lopment. The plants should be kept growing at a constant rate, avoiding a check in growth. , If one snow's the growth to slow up ap - preciably, two things may happen. One is, gnarly, rough tomatoes, and the other is cracked tomatoes may result. If the tomatoes are ripening and suffer for lack of water and irrigation water is then supplied, the fruits are likely to crack. Those who have followed, the trade journals and some eastern ex - periment station reports know that considerable has been written about the value of acid phosphate in stimulating earliness. The New Hampshire Experiment Station had found the addition of acid phos - phate up to 1500 pounds per acre, together with manure, to be desir - able. We have conducted a detailed experiment here for two years. As a result of this work, especially of the 1926 season— the 1927 figures not being summarized — we are of the opinion that acid phosphate does not do. us any good here on the heavier soils. On the lighter yandy soils — there might be some use for it. In heavier soils such as at Lincoln, we get if anything a depression in yield due to the use of acid phosphate, and we can not see that we get any increase. These experiments were conducted with, and without the " sprinkler system, with the John Baer variety. In the extreme northern and perhaps the extreme western end of the state there might be some use of acid phosphate. It remains to be tried out there. Another piece of information worked tout by the Michigan Experi - ment Station is that there is danger of hardening tomato plants ex - </seg>
            <seg id="p462">:EPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE eessively before transplanting 1 them. This hardening may result in - tentionally on the part of the grower, — to harden the plants against the period of transplanting; or it may come from plants suffering severely in transit from the south. In some respects hardening is a hazardous practice. They found that when plants were thoroughly hardened, the yield was cut down appreciably, as well as the number of fruits. They got 2916 fruits from tender stock, and. from well hardened stock they got 1610 fruits — a difference of 1306 fruits. I think the number of plants was 162. The production was 87.5 from the tender, and 40. from the hardened. The tender plants produced only 6 per cent culls, and the well hardened plants produced 38 per cent culls from the first picking. Hardening is necessary, but it might be better to delay transplant - ing a little bit, so that it would be necessary to plant thoroughly hardened plants and give each a steady growth, which you are less likely to get from planting plants when excessively hardened. There is another proposition that has come up, concerning which you have heard a great deal. That is the importance of vegetables in the human diet on account of the vitamine content of the vegetables. Vitamines have been spoken about so extensively that it probably is not necessary to say very much here as to what they are. We do not know just what they are. There have been some attempts made to learn more about them by chemical analysis, and possibly they may be definite chemical substances. They occur in small quantities,- and are absolutely necessary for certain vital processes. Certain vita - mines am necessary for growth, and others to prevent certain di - seases. In China they have trouble with beriberi, which results from the excessive use of polished rice. Then there is a vitamine necessary to prevent rickets in children. You have heard many stories about the seriousness of scurvy in the Klondike, in the civil war army camps, and years ago in our army post camps throughout the west. The trouble was that the diet did not, include such foods as contain vita - mines. All vegetables contain some vitamines, and some are high in one or more. The crrcen leafy vegetables have an especially high con - tent. Those who have connection with the green house business know that the demand for loose leaf lettuce has not been as good as it used to be, and that probably, taking the country over, it is declining every year. This has been a serious situation. A few years ago the vege - table greenhouse men started to claim that northern green house let - tuce was better than head lettuce or lettuce grown in California. They made many claims perhaps not based on facts then known, but largely </seg>
            <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA. STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY on supposition, claiming greenhouse lettuce had more vitamine content. About a year ago one of the horticultural men from the Michigan Agricultural College who received his training as a plant physiologist at this University — John Crist — tried out the different lands of lettuce; the inside leaves of head lettuce as compared with the outside; also lettuce grown in the greenhouse and outdoors. He fed these lots to white rats according to the approved style for studies of that kind. The results were reported a year ago at Philadelphia and have been published in some scientific journal since then. Dr. Crist secured this result: When he fed the outside leaves of head lettuce to rats, they made a greater gain in weight than when fed the inside leaves. They continued to gain for a longer time. When he us.ed the outside leaves of head lettuce compared with leaf lettuce, or used the inside leaves of head lettuce compared with regular green lettuce — loose leaf lettuce — then the loose or green leaf was ahead of the other insofar as the gain of the rats was concerned. There is a common supposition, — due to the fact that ultraviolet rays do not pass through ordinary window glass, that greenhouse lettuce consequently does not have the vitamine content of lettuce grown in the open. Dr. Crist checked up on that. There is consi - derable relationship between the ultraviolet rays and the development of these vitamines in food products. He found no difference in food values between leaf lettuce grown out of doors and under glass. ' This is of especial interest to the greenhouse men. At a meeting last week, Dr. Crist reported results secured in feeding bianched or white asparagus such as is raised in California and on the Atlantic coast, in comparison with green asparagus such as is raised here and throughout the northern vegetable producing region. Practically all canned asparagus is of the white type produced almost exclusively in California. He got some striking results. Here again white rats were used. When the green asparagus was fed to the white rats, they grew at a normal rate. When white raw asparagus was fed, the gain of the rats was slow for a week or two; then they started to lose weight. Very quickly they were losing weight rapidly; in fact, it almost seemed amazing that they lost more rapidly than the rats fed nothing at all! They died off quickly. Then he tried canned asparagus and cooked asparagus. Asparagus cooked in the ordinary way gave very much the same results as the raw asparagus, except that the rats did not lose weight quite as rapidly on cooked blanched .asparagus as on the raw product In the ' case of high pressure cooking for an hour or so, the results were similar, but not as good as I with the cooked, product. The. explanation made is that certain vitamines that promote growth -were not; •• :.-:•' '"■•■' ■•'-■ • '■■■ . '." !?■•-;:• </seg>
            <seg id="p464">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATIC BOARD OF ACKICl'LTl'RE in blanched asparagus. They are ordinarily associated with the pro - duction of green coloring matter in vegetables, and develop as rapidly a? the green color develops. As for the unfavorable, even injurious, results from the use of blanched asparagus, that was possibly due to the fact that certain amino compounds, which are in a way incomplete compounds from the standpoint of the proteins such as asparagin and quite a number of others, are quite prevalent in blanched asparagus and are somewhat injurious to animal life. Consequently if those experiments are carried out further and borne out by the investigations of other people, we will probably see quite a change in the asparagus market. There will be a greater tendency toward the canning- of green asparagus. I should like also to call attention to one other piece of work con - ducted during the past year, upon the value of cultivating or not cul - tivating vegetables. I will show some pictures concerning the root systems of vegetables, out of a textbook, published by Dr. Weaver of the Botany Department of this University . Its application comes from a piece of work published at the Cornell Experiment Station. (The pictures showed the root growth of a number of the more common vegetables, indicating the distance from the surface of the soil of the roots, which were mainly lateral, rather than vertical, and within two to six inches of the surface, so that cultivation would des - troy much of this root growth.) The object of cultivation is to destroy weeds and to close up the cracks in the soil and prevent loss of water; and also to have the soil loose so that it will absorb rainfall. That appears to be a sound principle for vegetable gardeners to apply. Dr. Thompson, of the Cornell Experiment Station has found with many vegetable crops that when the soil is kept clear of weeds, he got almost as good yields as where he cultivated just once or twice. He is not ready to say that one should not cultivate at all. Where cultivation was frequent and deep, considerable damage was done and the yield was cut down. In this com country with the common two-shovel corn cultivators, — which in order to do a good job necessitates plowing up six-inch furrows, we need to be careful. It may be necessary to get other types of cultivators with thre^ or four shovels so that it is n'ot neces - sary to move as much dirt with each shovel. It might be desirable to use knife-blade cultivators more extensively than at the present time. The aim should be to penetrate the soil as little as possible so far as depth is concerned, but keep it loose enough to absorb the rainfall. Whether that means one or two cultivations does not matter very much. Once in a while the market gardener's conscience disturbs him. He has heard at sometimes about the importance of cultivating eight </seg>
            <seg id="p465">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY to. ten times. While frequently gardeners get best results, they get it not because of frequent cultivations, but because they control the weeds. If those same fanners would practise a type of cultivation ' which is more adapted to these places, they would probably find their results just as good, and probably better, and they would save the labor cost. There are other features I wanted to take up, but my time is going by, so I will stop at this point. Are there questions on some of the matters brought up? THE PRESIDENT: This has been a wonderfully instructive lec - ture. We should like to have some questions. Discussion (Answers by MR. WERNER.) Q. Where can you get this early tomato seed? A. You can get the "Red River," which is good stock considerably ahead of anything else tin the market, from the North Dakota Agri - cultural College, or from the Wedge Seed and Nursery Company of Alberta Lea, Minnesota. The other stock won't be on the market this year. I think they want to get a large quantity before they let any of it out so that outsiders will not commercialize -the proposition. Q. What is the best average . date . to plant tomato seed in a hot bed or greenhouse to get your plants in the best condition for setting out, for the average year in this country? You said you could plant too late, or harden them too much. A. In this latitude, I am inclined to think the middle of March is plenty early enough. Frequently you get better results by seeding the end t&gt;f March and keeping* the plant growing constantly. While some of the earlier horticultural' works suggested that it is a good thing to have blossoms on the plants, it is often a bad thing. You may have noticed in greenhouses that sometimes your stock is not growing vigorously. The fruit sets and growth stops until the first fruits have ripened. When these fruits are picked off there is a renewal of growth. That has been worked out. There, is a definite reason for that. As the fruit sets, the growth is likely to be checked unless the nutrition of the plant is well balanced. If it is out of balance, the plant won't keep on growing. : Q. What about sixty days? A. That is" around fifty days here. ■■ </seg>
            <seg id="p466">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. STYER: I do not figure more than forty days at most for transplanting. We may not get such a large amount, bu: we get early tomatoes which bring big money, and that is what we are after. After a while we get a lot of them and there is not much in them. A MEMBER: I have put plants out the second day of April. A MEMBER: So have I. but they didn't do well. (Laughter.) MR. STYER: A neighbor set out to put overcoats on them. Q. Have you used plant caps successfully? MR. STYER: Not on tomatoes. MR. McCOMB: I do not put them out before the last ofi March. A MEMBER: Putting them in a cold frame and transplanting holds them back. MR. HOLSINGER: Our most successful grower gets his out early for strictly early tomatoes. He has them in six-inch pots. It takes from fifty to sixty days from the time he is ready to pul; them in the field. I have seen cold northers come and he had to cover every plant. He told me a few days ago he had sold over a) thousand dollars' work of tomatoes from three quarters of an acre. By the time he had them, they were worth twenty-five cents a pound. Bj[ the time the rest of us had them we got a cent a pound. A MEMBER: Two years ago I had to cover nine hundjed plants but it paid to do it. I THE PRESIDENT: I have experimented with the Burbank tomato. I have had plants grown in greenhouses in small pots, arid I have planted the seed. I get them about as quickly from the seed as from the green house plant. I want this spring to make six— or [eight-inch boxes, probably four inches high, and cover them with glass cloth and plant tomatoes early under those little boxes and put in a few radish seed to break the crust. I believe I will be ahead of :he green - house. I shall try it, anyway. Q. Would it be practical to put them in six-inch pots?

            <seg id="p467">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY "VARIOUS METHODS OF DISEASE CONTROL" DR. R. W. &lt;JOSS, Lincoln, Nebraska Before discussing: the various methods of controlling vegetable di - seases it might be well to de scribe briefly some of these dieases in the hope that you may recognize some of the abnormal plants which you have grown and wondered aoout at various times. It may seem pre - sumptious for me to state that you have wondered about these ab-. normal plants without recognizing them as being infected with distinct and often preventable diseases. I have never yet seen the grower who can consistently produce a crop free from all diseases however, nor have I met any man capable of recognizing all of the diseases produced, so that your lack of knowledge concerning many disease conditions is excusable. It is possible and usually profitable for a grower to become acquainted with the symptoms of these - diseases and the methods of preventing them. It is also cheaper to obtain this information from ■ the college than by practical experience with the diseases as they occur in your fields. In the intensive truck crop areas of the United States these diseases often become one of the chief limiting factors in the production, of .a crop. The growers in those localities of neces - sity become familiar with the diseases and methods of combating them. In the newer and less intensive areas and in the home gardens • the grower is often not as well acquainted with these diseases as he should be and as a result often suffers losses- which would be disastrous if they occurred to the larger growers in the same proportion. Some of these diseases are very common and often a small grower will un - consciously discount these losses even before planting when they could be cheaply and effectively prevented. If the total average yearly loss due to diseases occurred only once in ten years it would be considered a national calamity but familiarity often breeds contempt even though it is expensive. When I speak of disease I refer to those abnormal plants which occur as a result of infection with fungous or bacterial organisms and those infectious diseases such as mosaic which are known as virus di - seases. Of course there are many other abnormalities produced by un - favorable conditions of soil, moisture, temperature or nutrients as well j . as the many insect troubles which are often confused with infectious diseases. In as much as insects are often easy to see while fungous and" bacterial parasites are microscopic it is a very common failing to attribute all damage to insects. In controlling the diseases of plants we must emphasize the im - portance of preventing infection. The individual plant in vegetable i crops is not valuable enough to treat after it once becomes infected so_ that all our efforts are directed toward the prevention of initial infec- </seg>
            <seg id="p468">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion. Many diseases under favorable conditions may become i epidemic after they have once started in a field and many others after they once become established in a garden soil are difficult to deal with in the future. As many of these parasites have entirely different life histories it is impossible to devise means of combating all of them with any one treatment. It can therefore, be easily seen that a knowledge of the characteristic 'symptoms is necessary so that the disease may be identified and the proper methods of control applied. (Specimen showing characteristic symptoms of the diseases listed in the table were exhibited and described.) (See pages 24 and 25.) It might be well to now refer back to the subject assigned me, that is, the various methods of controlling these diseases. There are 5 general methods of combating plant diseases. These are (1) Exclusion: This method is applied chiefly by legislation thru the quarantine laws which prevent or restrict the shipment of plant material from a country or state where certain diseases are present to other localities where the parasites do not yet occur. This is a much debated subject and one which I do not wish to discuss in detail at this time except to point out that such quarantine can hardly b 5 expected to forever prevent the introduction of a parasite into new territory. They do however, delay the spread so that other preventative measures may be developed. It is also true that most of our severe diseases have been introduced from other states and countries. The application of this method of exclusion by the individual in a voluntary manner is the phase of the subject I wish to emphasize. Many of the diseases I described you will remember are introduced in the seed and are chiefly controlled by the use of disease free seed. This is true or all three of the bean diseases mentioned, cabbage black-rot, anthracnbse of cu - curbits and bacterial spot of tomato. Many other diseases iwhich are not serious at the present time in Nebraska can be introduce!! by seeds and seedlinfr plants. The indiscriminate introduction of new! seed and plants into an agricultural section as small as a vegetable garden often results in the occurrence of diseases which are ever after a "source of trouble and expense. Obtain healthy plants and disease free seed from as near home as possible and to doubly insure yourself against the in - troduction of parasites on such seed practice the second method of control. (2) Eradication: This method refers to the killing of the para - sites and while there are various methods of doing this we are only concerned here with vegetable crops where the method is that of seed treatment. There are various ways of treating seed depending upon the parasite and the seed as the aim is of course to kill the parasite without injuring the seed. The chief substances employed are mercu- </seg>
            <seg id="p469">NEBRASKA STATE HOUTICULTUltE SOCIETY l-icbi chloride (corrosive sublimate) formaldehyde and ht&gt;t water. There are also a number of organic mercury compounds on the market under various trade names which may be effective against certain di - seases. The treating of cabbage seed with a 1 to 1000 solution of corrosive sublimate .for 30 minutes, rinsing in water and drying and the same treatment of tomato seed for 5 minutes with a 1 to 3000 solution should be practiced when the origin of the seed is unknown. Corrosive sublimate (bichloride of mercury) can be purchased in the drug store in tablet form with directions for making up to the re - quired strengths. Hot formaldehyde solution is used for the control of potato diseases carried on the surface of the seed potato. Such treat - ments should be considered just as necessary a part of growing a crop as any of the various cultural operations performed. The slight effort and expense involved in thus j insuring a crop against disease is amply repaid when the crop is harvested. Under the heading of eradication we can also include the destruc - tion of the parasite along with the. infected plant. The pulling out - and discarding infected plants is one ttf the chief methods of con - trolling cucumber wilt, and the various mosaic diseases. The eradica - tion of the weeds upon which the disease or parasite overwinters is also a necessary practice with the mosaic diseases. Another form t&gt;f eradication is that of killing the organisms in the soil. This of course can only be applied to the seed bed and is usually practiced by steam sterilizing the soil. There are also various - chemical methods of sterilizing the L'oil. New soil or sterilized soil is necessary in the seed bed to cpntrol damping off and other parasitic diseases that live over winter in the soil and .which start infections in the seed bed which may not be causing any apparent damage but which are later spread to the field and cause considerable loss. The third general disease control method is that of Protection. Under this heading would come the use of sprays and dusts which form a protective covering of the foliage and prevent the parasites which fall upon the leaf from growing and entering the plant. I 1 . will not go into this matter in detail as several references have already been made to the use of Bordeaux mixture and exact recom - mendations can be obtained from the college. The essential point to remember in spraying is the timeliness and the thoroughness of the application. The fourth method of control is that of planting resistant or non - susceptible varieties. Such varieties have been selected and bred up until i't the pies&lt;nt time there are successful resistant varieties for use with a number of crops. They are often used to combat diseases which live over in the • soil such as the wilt diseases of cabbage and </seg>
            <seg id="p470">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tomato. Varieties of asparagus resistant to rust, and of beans resistant to blight and mosaic are also now obtainable. The use of resistant varieties is the logical and practical method of controlling many di - seases but the work required in selecting and breeding theqe varieties is slow and laborious but good progress is being made in this direc - tion. The fifth general method of control is that of Inhibition or Sanita - tion and this is a method that can be applied by every grower at a. slight expense. This method of control is of great assistance in com - bating many diseases. It is of special importance with vegetable crops when the area of land involved often does not allow for long rotations and when the large amount of top growth affords ideal con - ditions for the overwintering of organisms when such plant refuse is allowed to accumulate. This method as applied to the host plant usually means the nearest approach to the ideal conditions for the development of the plant as possible. The relation of the plant to its environment, soil, water, nutrients, cultivation and so forth are always thought of in con - nection with the production of large crops but such factors are also of importance in disease control. Unfavorable environmental conditions often result in weakening the plat so that it is more susceptible to infection by parasites. This is especially important in the seed bed. For example, the damping off disease which attacks a large variety of plants in the seeding stage or as cuttings is caused by one of a considerable number of fungus organisms which live in the soil. They do not cause any damage as long as the plant is kept under ideal conditions but when ' the seed bed is crowded, or poorly ventilated and excessive moisture is present along with high temperatures they are capable of attacking the stem at the surface of the ground and killing a large percentage of the plants. Under such conditions the disease spreads rapidly and causes severe losses. The same unfavorable con - ditions in the seed bed are also conducive to the propogation and spread of other parasites which will do their greatest damage after the seedlings are transplanted in the field. It is therefore, essential and easily possible to avoid these conditions and prevent damping off and also the inception of other diseases before transplanting. The use of new soil in the bed and the sterilization of infested soil has already been discussed but can again be emphasized in connection with the prevention of diseases in the seed bed. The rotation of crops is not always practical on small areas but the continuous use of soil for the same or related crops should be avoided as far as possible as the soil inhabiting parasites will rapidly multiply and under favorable conditions ■will cause severe losses. The </seg>
            <seg id="p471">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY destruction of infected plants and the refuse of plant parts is a more practical means of controlling' diseases in the case of vegetable crops than with field crops.' It should always be practiced as a sanitation method and it will do much to inhibit the diseases caused by organ - isms which live over in such refuse. The same method is also v&gt;f as - sistance in controlling insect pests. There are only a relatively few -ways in which diseases of vege - table crops live over winter, in or on the seeds, in the soil or plant refuse and sometimes in perennial weeds. . Remember this when you arc attempting to control plant diseases. They are only controlled practically by prevcntative measures. The control measures I have outlined are essential if losses due to diseases are to be avoided and they become increasingly important in proportion to the length of time an area is devoted to the raising of vegetable crops and the intensity of the agriculture in that area. . Discussion (Answers by DR. GOSS) Q. You spoke about sterilizing the soil. What do you use for this? A. Steam, usually. The usual system has been a boiler connected with an inverted pan which sets over the soil. I have also seen hollow tile put under the ground, connected with the heating system, and steam 'running through that. I think the steam pan has been the most practical method. , Q. I tried mixing Semesan with the soil a year ago, but it was not successful. A. We have not tried it on vegetable diseases. There have been reports it is effective in controlling certain diseases. There are reports it is effective in controlling potato diseases, but it is not in Nebraska. We get some control for Rhizoctonia, but we are not recommending it for the control of scab. The hot formaldehyde method is so much better. THE PRESIDENT: If no further questions, the next subject is "Commercial Vegetable Production around Omaha," by E. G.

            <seg id="p474">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "COMMERCIAL VEGETABLE PRODUCTION AROUND OMAHA" E. G. MAXWELL, County Agent, Omaha, Nebraska Mr. Chairman: 1 am not very friendly to Mr. Hoppert for put - ting me on this program, because I feel there are a number of other people, and some who are here, who could give you a better story about commercial vegetable production around Omaha than I can. Mr. Hoppert has a habit of putting one on the program and notify - ing him later. (Laughter.) So I have pretty nearly got to go through with it. It is not easy to find out very much definitely about the extent of vegetable production around Omaha. We have no organization that takes in the entire number of people who produce vegetables commercially, so it is difficult to get information about the extent of the business. There is probably 100 thousand dollars' worth of surplus vegetables produced and marketed in the vicinity of Omaha. A small percentage is marketed at roadside stands. Some is sold direct to the consumer by the growers themselves by house to house canvass, but not a large percentage. Most of the vegetables are marketed either to the grocers at a market maintained in the market center, or to curbstone brokers. We have a fruit and vegetable association known as the Omaha Fruit Association that handles quite a lot of the fruit produced, but not much of the vegetables. The vegetables are mostly sold at pub - lic market to these grocers who come to buy their supply, and to curbstone brokers who buy them and sell either by house to house visiting or to the grocers. These are the fellows who know the situation probably better than any other set of people in Omaha. They know what they are doing. They are the shrewdest bunch in this line. They know how to buy the stuff and how to sell it. The territory where the vegetables are produced extends for quite a distance from the north line of Douglas county to some little distance into Sarpy county. The soil is well adapted to vegetable production. It is Knox silt loam, and if there is plenty of moisture, there can be a large amount of vegetables grown on it. I do not think the disease and insect pests are limiting factors in vegetable production in the vicinity of Omaha. I believe there could be and would be more vegetables grown if it were assured that they could be sold at a profit. I think the ability to sell the products at a profit is the limiting factor in the quantity of vege - tables produced around Omaha. The housewife says vegetables are too high. I doubt if there are 50 per cent of the vegetables consumed in Omaha that would be </seg>
            <seg id="p475">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY consumed . if a well conducted advertising 1 campaign to boost vege - tables were put on. I took occasion to talk to some of the house - wives about this. I asked what they thought about the price of vegetables compared with other food products. They had the idea vegetables were too high. One person called my attention to a fam - ily who had gone onto almost a strict vegetable diet, cutting out practically all meats and quite a lot of dairy products, too, and they said it raised the cost of living. Their food bill was higher than for - merly. I believe it is more or less a general opinion that vegetables cost too much; yet the growers are not getting too much for their product. You can guess where the trouble is. I think if we had an advertising campaign to boost the value of vegetables in the diet, even though they were high, a lot of people would use more than they are now using. •" I ran across an article the other day, and since something has been said about the food value of vegetables, I will give part of it to you. I think it contains some good stuff. This fellow evidently had gone into literature and picked up a lot of statistics, and he gives us something to think about. He says: "The total annual income of the families in the United States is about 70 billion dollars, which, divided among the 45 million earners, gives $1,555 for each head of a family or person gainfully employed. A study of family budgets shows better than one-third of this is ex - pended for food. Is the vegetable grower getting his rightful share? I suspect he is not. There (is keen rivalry in the game of dangling attractive foods before the eyes of the consumer. The packer argues every family should have meat once a day. The dairyman insists it is not safe to leave out milk and butter. Oranges and pineapples have been dramatized to the public. We are waiting for some one to give us a story of the food value of the truck products. "More than a million fa:-ms in the United States are without gar - dens. Why not start a campaign to put vegetable gardens on the farms as well as in city back yards? This would be nearer the old admonition: 'Physician, heal thyself.' "There is one acre of commercial asparagus for 3,500 population; one of green beans for 1250 population; one of peas for 15,000; one of Brussels sprouts for 105,000; one of cabbage for 900; one of lettuce for 5,000; and one of spinach for 10,000." I do not know how true these figures are, but I imagine they are not far off. </seg>
            <seg id="p476">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I have not told you a great deal about vegetable production around Omaha. There are probably not very many definite figures to . ■ be had. I know there aren't. There are probably 100 thousand dol - lars' worth of surplus vegetables produced in the Omaha territory, and probably 125 thousand dollars' worth of fruits — apples and small fruits. Much of the fruit is sold at roadside markets,' but not so much of the vegetables. Probably there are 250 people in the terri - tory who are producing surplus vegetables. Only a small number market their stuff through the Omaha Fruit Growers Association. I am not familiar with just how it works or how effective it is in helping the farmer dispose of his stuff; but I believe it has been of considerable benefit. It is not truly co-operative. It is a stock com - pany. They are some men here who are members of that Associa - tion who probably would be willing to tell us something of how it works if any one is interested. If you have questions, I will try to answer them. Discussion MR. HOLSINGER: I think Mr. Maxwell is conservative about the amount of surplus vegetables produced around Omaha. I have spent a good many years around another market of a town larger than Omaha, and have seen as many as a thousand wagons loaded with fruits and vegetables on the Kansas City market in a single day. I believe if the gentleman doubled his figures he would be con - servative. I have a tenant farming about fifteen acres. I do not know how much he takes in, in a year. He is a foreigner. I have had two tenants in nineteen years. The first one left- at the end of five years with lfi thousand dollars to buy a little farm. He made it selling vegetables and trucking to the Kansas City market. I used to be in the fruit and vegetable game, and drove a mar - ket wag-on from the time I was ten years old until I left the farm ' to take up this work. We sold both fruit and vegetables. I have been interested in so many phases of the subject this afternoon. I was interested in what was said about tomatoes and asparagus. Somebody brought up the subject of vitamine content in blanched asparagus. In Illinois and eastern Iowa they are using ' green asparagus for canning purposes. Last fall was the first time I ever saw green asparagus in a commercial can. The Northwestern railroad served it in the dining car. The steward brought out the can when I asked to see it. It was canned at Rochelle, Illinois. Lots of interest is being shown in it. ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY In some respects you can blame our home- economics people for that. I have a grudge against them. ' I'll wager there are ten bush - els of carrots raised now to where there was one bushel raised eight years ago because of the drive made on them. It just happens I do not like carrots, and my wife does; so we have carrots oftener than I want. (Laughter.) I think maybe there are other men in the • same boat. . There is more sense • than fiction to the statement if the vege - table growers could put on a drive for the consumption of vegetables like the dairymen have 'with their products and the folks in Califor - nia with their fruits, and the apple men coming here we could quad - ruple' the use of more vegetables, and society would be better for it. I like meat as well as the rest of you folks, but I think I know I am better off when I use less meat and eat more green vegetables. THE PRESIDENT: The next subject is "The Vegetable Grower Needs Modern Equipment." It will be discussed by Mr. Holsinger, of Ames, Iowa. "THE USE OF MODERN MACHINERY IN VEGETABLE •GARDENING" MR. V. V. Holsinger, Iowa State College, Ames In discussing this subject, I wish to say that it would be well to divide it into two parts, namely, market gardening, and truck " ] \ farming. ' For the ordinary market gardener who handles anywhere from 5 to 10 acres of land with perhaps a few exceptions, relatively '. little improvement has been made in the last 25 years so far as equip - ment is concerned. It is true that from time to time some kind of machinery and equipment is produced that is worth while, but in the long run very little has been done that has been of much benefit to the ordinary market gardener with two or three exceptions. Probably the auto truck has been worth more to the market gardener, than all the rest combined. It was jnot so many years ago that it was my fortune, or perhaps misfortune would be better, to be a fruit grower and gardener. To get our products on the market, it was necessary to get up anywhere from 1 jto .3 o'clock in the morning in order that we could be on the market learly enough to get the most out of the products which we had to sell. At the present time, a market gar - dener who is farming a piece of this ' same land and which I still own, can arise at 4:30, crank up his Ford truck, and be on the mar - ket inside of thirty minutes j or less depending, on how fast he drives. - As soon as he has disposed jof his load, it is only a matter of a few moments to reload his empty receptacles and be at home in another thirty minutes. Measured by the time which it took us to make </seg>
            <seg id="p478">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the round trip with a team and wagon, the truck easily makes a saving of 2% to 3 hours. This man is able to get his supply of barnyard manure which is hauled from the stockyards and transfer barns a distance of some five miles, and is able to make four loads a day. In our time with a team and wagon, it was a good eleven hours' job to get two loads a day, loads that would weigh from 4,500 to 6,000 pounds. Last Christmas, while visiting the farm, these people were able to get out four loads a day in much less time and loads which would average almost as much per load as we were able to do with the old farm wagon and horses. The market gardener still has two or three essential things that he must bear in mind when he starts into business. Probably the thing of most importance would be a supply of water, at least a number of market gardeners have told me that if they were starting over again, this would be the first factor that they would investigate on locating. To be near a supply of fertilizer, particularly barn - yard manure is quite important, but due to the fact that there is a shortage of this type of fertilizer, it is not quite so essential, though highly desirable. Commercial fertilizers can be made to take the place of barnyard manure, but in the long run, in growing vege - tables, the latter is very much to be desired. More market gardeners make use of glass for the forcing of plants and vegetables than they used to. A great deal has been done in the way of increased use of glass during the past twenty or twenty-five years. Because of the shortage of manure already referred to, glass structures are being put up by most market gar - deners. One great change in the use of glass, particularly hot beds, has been the necessity for heating the soil with hot water or steam instead of by using the fermenting 1 barn yard manure. Comparatively few gardeners in Iowa are using this method as yet. However, it is only a question of time until many of them will have to come to it. I am not sure but what better plants in the long run will bo. grown by this method than by the old method where the fer - menting manure has been used, but some changes in methods of handling the beds will have to be learned by the grower before he can get tho most out of bed where straw or hot water is used. Referring to the subjects of water supply, the object of this was for the purposes of irrigation as well as for watering greenhouses and hot beds. Water is used in rather large quantities and is greatly to be desired. When plants are to be irrigated in the field, there are some three methods that can be used, namely, the overhead system, subirrigation and surface irrigation. Market gardeners will proba - </seg>
            <seg id="p479">. NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY bly find the overhead system by far the most satisfactory. The prin - ciple drawback to this type of irrigation is the cost of equipment and installation of it. In many cases, however, the cost of installation can be taken care of by the increased yield, sometimes in the same - year the plant is installed, when we take into account that a crop on a single acre of ground will sometimes ' in favorable seasons give a' gross return of a thousand dollars or more. This is particularly true in seasons of drouth when crops would be complete failures if water could not be supplied. 'Last fall during 1 the period of hot dry weather which we had in Central Iowa, my attention was called to a field of lettuce which was set in a thrifty growing condition due to the water supply which' was administered by an overhead system of irrigation. During the heat of the day, the water was continually sprayed on the lettuce which was to keep it cool and prevent its being burned. On a near - by field where no water was applied, the plants were almost com - pletely destroyed. Some celery plants under similar conditions were badly burned and were of no value whatever at the usual time for bleaching. As to the cost of installation, it depends very much on who builds it. One system with which I am familiar was constructed by some very enterprising market gardeners living near Des Moines. To reach the place where a constant supply of water was available, it was necessary to lay a 4-inch line but a distance of 2,600 feet from the greenhouse , and gardens. The water table, where the wells or ' points were driven, was some 15. or 16 feet below the surface of the ground. A number of points were driven, a dozen or more, and connected up with a Diesel engine. The pumping plant and point would cost about the same, no matter where the garden was located, but the pipe line itself was one of the interesting factors in connec - tion with this job. The owner was able to buy second hand pipe from a second-hand dealer, buying it as junk. This pipe happened to be old boiler tubes 18 or 20 feet long. These were carefully inspected. Any that were too badly rusted or had any holes in them were discarded. However, most of the pipe had been recently taken but of boilers in the plant, that had been used for generating steam right up to the time they were condemned. Most of them ■were in pretty good shape for the purpose wanted. These sections of pipe wore then placed end to end and were welded together into sections 200' feet long. A new piece of pipe a foot long and which had been threaded was welded onto each end of the old pipe. As soon as enough pipes of this kind had been welded together, they were dragged into position.) and connected. The biggest saving was in the kind of pipe used. The owner, at any rate, told me that this </seg>
            <seg id="p480">IEPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICI'LTITRR 4-inch pipe after it had been welded together and placed in the line, cost him a little less than 10c a foot. Second hand pipe bought at junk prices was used for overhead irri - gation. To maintain the overhead pipe at the proper height, old sections of pipe not good enough for the conveyance of water were driven into the ground at the proper height. Instead of using the roller supports that the manufacturers send out with their equipment, supports were made out of heavy wire that seemed to answer the purpose. The long sections of pfpe which were connected with the direct feed line were easily disconnected at the feed line, and a second perhaps 300 feet long was carried from one field to the other as needed. Enough hands were maintained on the place to make it quite feasible to handle the pipe in this way without taking it apart each time the field was to be irrigated. In addition to the construction of the irrigation plant, referred to above, the people operating it maintain a large greenhouse of some 30 or 40 thousand square feet and have used old junk pipe for much of the construction of the greenhouse. They also use the heavy 4-inch pipe for conveying the hot water throughout the build - ing. The market gardener who has an abundant supply of water easily within reach whether from shallow well, lake or stream, is in - deed fortunate. Growers who live close to a supply of city water are probably the most fortunate of all. The trouble that one has in keeping the power plant in repair is then eliminated. Another simple pumping outfit that has come to my attention is located in the Des Moines River bottom near Ottumwa. In this case, a few points were driven into the sand, a small gas engine was installed which in turn was hitched onto a rotary pump. Enough water was secured from this small outfit to irrigate several acres of ground, but all in all, I am sure that the fellow who is able to equip his place with the overhead system of irrigation is the one that is going to succeed in the long run. Many market gardeners are using various kinds of machines for tying bunches, but most of them with which I am familiar make it a practice to bunch much of their green stock in the field. Cotton string used to be the material most generally used for tying. How - ever, many market gardeners are using the elastic band and find. that they can snap these onto a bunch of radishes or onions or any other green stuff that requires bunching more quickly than they can by the use of machines. Bunching machines for tying of asparagus are being used in some places. I think, however, that most of the asparagus grown in the Middle-West is put up in half-pound bunches. </seg>
            <seg id="p481">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY These in turn are largely tied together either with string or with rubber bands. Transplanting machines are used to a limited extent by market gardeners, but as a rule, these are used by gardeners who are plant - ing considerable more ground than the man who I have in mind in this discussion. The transplanting machines are very handy for planting cabbage, sweet potatoes, strawberry plants, and other plants of this nature. One party of my acquaintance who was in - terested in planting some eighty acres of asparagus had two of these transplanting machines and used them for this purpose with considerable success. To get the most out of them, it is necessary that the machine be drawn very slowly, or there will be quite a number of plants missing in the field. With crops like cabbage and strawberries, any that are missing will be quickly noticed and" missing plants may be replaced. When it comes' to equipping of truck farms operated on a large scale, much labor saving machinery is available. This applies to growers who specialize in one or more kinds of truck, such as cab - bage, onions, sweet potatoes, etc. Here each grower must find out what machinery he can use to best advantage and equip himself accordingly. One grower in the north part of Iowa specializes heavily in onions. At a recent visit to his place, he showed me a field of onions on which only power-driven machinery was used up to the time the onions were harvested. Some of these were carted to the railway with horse-drawn wagons. All of the planting, cultivating, and other work was done by tractors, or trucks. In this particular field, the land was plowed and cared for by a tractor. As soon as the land was prepared, a . seeder drawn by a Ford one-ton truck was used to do the planting. This same truck was used later to draw the cultivator. Four drills fastened rigidly together insures the rows. being 1 planted the same distance apart. Cultivators having been fas - tened together cultivate the 1 same four rows planted by the four row drill. In this district, one field of forty acres of onions, was cultivated for a little less than $10 per acre. It is needless to say that this was possible only because the land is almost entirely weed free. .Over in the Davenport region is another section where onions are grown rather extensively. Almost the entire crop is produced from small sets which of course have to be planted each spring. One of these enterprising men has invented a machine for planting, the sets. A few years ago 1 , all of these sets had to be put in by hand. Now with a plantar which is capable of planting two rows at a time and ■ which is pulled usually by a small garden tractor, the work of ten to 25 men is done in one day by one skillful operator. </seg>
            <seg id="p482">LKPOKT UK NKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Because they can use machinery to such a good advantage, a full carload of small garden tractors was purchased last season (1926). As I have already stated, much labor saving machinery has been perfected. Still much of the hand labor of gardening still re - mains as it was fifty years ago. When we reach the stage where the asparagus tips can be cut with machinery, bunched and tied as farmers now do with small grain, or when only mature radishes and onions can be pulled from the row and bunched in the same way and when ripe tomatoes can be picked, wiped and placed on baskets, then market gardening will be greatly simplified. THE PRESIDENT: We will stand adjourned until 9:30 on Wednesday morning-. I hopn you will all be present. WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION January 4, 1928 The second session of the convention met on Wednesday morning, January 4, and was called to order by President Davidson at 9:35 o'clock. THE PRESIDENT: I know you are waiting patiently for this program. We have a great many things of interest to discuss. I will not take up much of your time for my address. I know you would rather hear these experts. I do not claim to be an expert. PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS MR. J. R. DAVIDSON, Aurora, Nebraska Members of the Horticultural Society, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is with genuine pleasure that I am enabled to meet with you again. A society is judged by its membership and by what it ac - tually accomplishes. Our last year's program was one to be proud of, and I doubt if many people of the state, realize what was accom - plished. It seems to me a report of the year's activities should now be ready for distribution. Our January meetings were exceptionally good and were well attended. Our fruit trip through Southeast i Nebraska was a hummer, and an eye opener to all those who went on this trip. I read a newspaper report that said there were 100 autos on this trip, and while I did not count this many, I- know there were a lot of autos as well as people present. Starting at Union we took in every orchard and vineyard to Shubert and I want to tell you that we put in a full day of it, had </seg>
            <seg id="p483">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY a great time and were treated royally by the owners of the orchards and vineyards. At Shubert the meeting was called to order and we listened to Hon. A. J. Weaver, who told us of the growth of the apple business in the country we had just been through, and that he believed there was -no better apple country anywhere. Mr. Weaver said that he was investing in orchards right along. We also had a talk from Mr. Boles of the Missouri Pacific R. It. telling us how the railroad was doing everything possible to cooperate with the growers. I believe a trip of this kind is worth while, but I believe it would be better if we could have two days for the trip, as we had to hurry too much and could not look around as much as we wished. I believe the success of this trip was in a large part due to the planning of Prof. Hoppert who even had the turns of the road marked with arrows, so none of us would get lost. The fruit display at the state fair was a wonder, and I had a hard jog trying to make people believe that those wonderful apples were raised in Nebraska. But I believe I succeeded in making them believe that Nebraska grew the finest apples in the world, and I often wished I had a sample to give them, to clinch what I had told them. I think it ought to be possible to have a much greater plate dis - play, as so many different parts of our state are now growing fruit, and if there was some way to get the people to send in their best fruit, it would help the display a whole lot. I believe this can be worked out with the help of the county agents and others in - terested in fruit growing. Another thing I want to mention is this, I do not believe the central and western parts of the state should compete with the Missouri river counties. We all know the eastern part of the state is. more favorably situated for fruit growing, and I should be in, favor of dividing the state into three districts, having the lines run north and south across the state, making an eastern, middle and western division, and that fruits from these sections should be grouped together, and should compete together. I believe this would stimulate the displaying of fruits at the fair for as it now is we of the central part of the state only expect to get a second premium now and then.. If members think this is worth while, I would be pleased to see some action taken. I have enjoyed being your president, and want to thank you all for the kindness and consideration shown me. I thank you. The next thing on the progrkm is "The Importance of Pollination in Fruit Growing," to be discussed by Mr. W. W. Yocum, of Lin - coln. (Applause). </seg>
            <seg id="p484">IKPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BUAHU OF AGRICULTURE "THE IMPORTANCE OF POLLINATION IN FRUIT GROWING" MR. W. W. YOCUM, Lincoln, Nebraska I hope I may be able to make my talk resemble a modern woman's dress, in that it is long enough to cover the subject, and short enough to be interesting. (Laughter.) The blooming season is the most critical season of the year for most of our tree fruits, and it is a time of great anxiety for all fruit growers. The chief cause of anxiety is due to weather condi - tions at that time, fruit men are apt to overlook other factors which may influence their fruit crop. I refer especially to the pollination of our fruits. In the past there have been heavy losses in many orchards due to lack of proper pollination. To remedy those conditions it has been necessary to resort to extreme measures su&gt;ch as uprooting and replanting a part of the orchard, or top working a part of the trees. Investigations on the subject of pollination have been carried on in relatively recent years. The work is slow, because the polli - nation work can be conducted only during four or five days for each variety during the blooming season. It is a particular job, too. By pollination of fruits we mean the transfer of pollen from the stamen to the pistil of the flowers. This gives opportunity for fertilization which is necessary for seed production. As we know, very few of our fruits are produced without seeds. In the case of apples and pears, those fruits which produce the most seeds are more apt to stick and reach full development than those with a smaller number of seeds. It is commonly known that most of the apples that fall in the June drop contain few or no seeds. That is due par- . ti'ally to a lack of pollination and partly to nutrition. Nearly all fruits produce more blossoms than they can mature fruit. Even if well pollinated, some would have to drop because of competition for food. If none of the blossoms are pollinated, all are apt to drop and you won't get a set of fruit. If pollination occurs between the flowers of one seedling plant, we call it self-pollination. If it occurs between two seedling plants, it I is referred to as cross pollination. You will see that most fruits . | require cross pollination. At first thought you might think two Jona- ' than apple trees should pollinate one another because they are indi - vidual trees. When we remember, however, that all Jonathan trees have been produced by budding and grafting, we will know they are really a part of the parent Jonathan seedling produced some years ajro. It is the same with other varieties of fruits. </seg>
            <seg id="p485">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Those which produce fruit successfully from their own pollen we speak of as being self-pollinated and self-fertile. When fruits require pollen from some* other variety to cause fruit setting, we refer to it as cross pollination. These varieties are self-sterile, since they can not produce fruit satisfactorily from their own pollen. A third condition may exist in the case of certain varieties which will not suitably pollinate one another. This is called intersterility. .As an example, we have Grimes Golden failing to pollinate Wine Sap successfully. • The study of pollination in this country began near the close of the last century with a study of pear orchards in the eastern states. There were blocks of pears planted to single varieties. They were not fruiting successfully. A man from the United States Department of Agriculture found nearly all varieties of pears do hot produce fruit from their own pollen. . Since 1900, the most important work along tins line has been a study of sweet cherries in the north west. Many of the orchards in the northwest came to bearing age and did not fruit successfully. They had varieties interplanted. They found the cause of unfruitful - ness was due to intersterility, or sterility between certain varieties. Their investigations enabled them to find varieties that were suitable pollinizers for commercial sorts. In recent years the trend in the production of apples has also . tended to p'roduce a more serious situation in the pollinization of our apples. Market requirements have cut down the number of stan - dard varieties, also disease resistance, hardiness and a number of other factors have caused many varieties to be eliminated. Now we have a smaller number of varieties ordinarily planted. It becomes more important as the number is reduced to find those varieties which • pollinate one another successfully. So pollination is more of a.prob - lem with apples than formerly. The studies of pollination have shown that sterility is not a fixed character. One variety may be self-sterile at one time or in a certain locality. In another locality it may be self -fertile. So that the condition of sterility varies with the nutrition of the tree and the I • soil and climate. Therefore the study of pollination is not only a | study of varieties, but also of conditions. • You may think from what 1 1 have said it would be difficult to give any definite statements as to the condition of pollination of our fruits, or make recommendations. I think we can make some statements that will be worth while, and recommendations which should benefit our i orchard practices. I will take up in order our orchard fruits and </seg>
            <seg id="p486">:EPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE discuss the pollination condition in each. Most of my work has been with apples, and for that reason I will be able to give you more in - formation on apples than other fruits. Most varieties of apples are self-sterile. Even those varieties which are self-fruitful are benefited by cross-pollination. Some varie - ties which are fairly self-fruitful and may produce a profitable crop with their own pollen in certain sections are Grimes Golden, Wealthy, Duchess, and Yellow Transparent. In our work in Missouri the past two years, we found Grimes was entirely self-sterile, so I would not bank on any of them and trust to their setting fruit that way. At the Maine Experiment Station 119 varieties of apples were tested to see if they were self-fruitful or self-sterile. Only fifteen varieties were self-fruitful enough to produce a satisfactory commercial crop. At the Oregon Station 87 varieties were tested, and out of that ' number, only fifteen were self-fruitful. So you see the amount of self-fertility in apples is relatively low. When we remember it varies with soil conditions and the seasons, you can see it would not be safe to plant large blocks of a single variety, even if it "is fairly self - fruitful. I have given a list of varieties most self-fruitful. We have a list of those self-sterile to a high degree. All varieties in the Wine Sap family as Winesap, Black Twig, Stayman and Arkansas Black, are self - sterile. Thr reason for self-sterility in this group is they do not produce live pollen. The pollen is abortive and only a small per - centage of it is "ffective. For that reason we can not depend upon the Wine Saps to pollinate their flowers or those of any other variety. Some other varieties which are se\f-stevi\e are Missouri Pippin, Rome, Genet, York, Mclntosh, Northern Spy, Rhode Island Greening, and Maiden Blush. Going- back to the Wine Sap family, we might give more attention to the Black Twig. It is a valuable variety, but in many sections it has failed to set fruit satisfactorily. I do not know what condition it is in this state. It set fruit well here last year. In the east they have carried on investigations to try to determine what varieties will be the best pollinizers for the Black Twig, and they found delicious and Jonathan were the most effective. They found also in most of the I eastern orchards Black Twigs had been planted with Grimes and other I members of the Wine Sap family. Grimes will not pollinate any mem- ■ ber of the Wine Sap family, but it is good for other varieties. This ! explains why Black Twig often failed to set fruit in that section. Most intersterility seems to be due to the production of poor \ pollen. This case of Grimes failing to pollinate a. Wine Sap is one i </seg>

            <seg id="p488">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE orchard, we recommend that at least two or more varieties of each of these main groups be planted together. If planting American plums, plant two or three varieties together. If planting the European sort, do the same, so that they will provide pollen for one another. As in the case of other fruits, they should bloom at the same time. Sour cherries are generally self-fruitful, while sweet cheeries are largely self-sterile. We are chiefly interested in sour cherries here, and are glad to know that one variety will pollinate its own blossoms.- The Duke cherries vary. They are best pollinated by sour varieties. I here refer to the cast- of the sweet cherries in the northwest. There is a higher degree of inter?terility in sweet cherries than in any tree fruits so far studied. That does not concern us much here. The pollinizing agents, which we ordinarily think of are wind and insects. In the case of our tree fruits, wind is almost a negligible factor. It does not carry pollen to a satisfactory degree. This has been tested in a number of ways. One way has been to put plain glass slides smeared with vaseline between the trees in the orchard at blooming time, and catch the pollen if it carries across. After some, hours, the investigator studied those slides under the microscope and found very little pollen was carried across, even under rather strong wind. The pollen particles seem to be quite heavy and fall directly to the ground. Another way of investigating has been to screen certain trees to exclude insects, and trust to the wind to carry the pollen. It was found that they do not set fruit when trusting to the wind alone. Of the insects that pollinate our fruits, we know the honey bee is the chief one. However, in some sections wild bees or flies may play a large part in pollinating the fruits. Even night-flying moths may be effective. It is claimed in England that most of their fruits are pollinated by bumble bees. The importance of the honey bee is such that we should provide honey bees in ample numbers to insure the transfer of pollen between our fruit trees. In the northwest in the cherry section, orchardists have been renting colonies of bees. The rent they pay brings them a higher return than any other cost of pro - duction. Perhaps orchardists inj this section could afford to do likewise. It is hard to make a definite statement as to the number of colonies to be placed in an orchard. A good deal depends upon the age of the trees and the abundance of bloom. Older trees will require more bees than yountr trees, and trees in full bloom will require more than if a smaller amount of bloom is produced. But in general, it is recommended that one hive to every two acres should he provided. These hives should be distributed over the orchard so that the bees </seg>
            <seg id="p489">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY will not have to travel. a long distance. The distance over which they will work is not definitely known, but it is claimed they will travel in fair weather from one to two miles, if there are flowers in the intervening space. In favorable weather, even large blocks of a single variety would be successful pollinated, because bees could carry pollen from a neighboring orchard. However, it is unfavorable weather .which will determine the num - ber of colonies which should be placed in an orchard. The distance the varieties are planted apart will have something to do with the effectiveness of pollinization. It is usually recommended that we plant not more than four rows of a single variety of apples before we plant another variety. The reason is bees will not work much over two hundred feet against strong whjd, or in case of a spell of unfavorable weather they can not travel over a long distance. In planting orchards, we should alternate the varieties, planting three or four, rows of a standard commercial sort we care most about, and then a second variety which will also be a commercial variety, to provide pollen. Remember if it is the Wine Sap variety that is planted, we must plant at least three varieties in succession so that we provide pollen for i the variety that pollinates the Wine Sap. Those best pollinizers Delicious, Jonathan, Ben Davis and Grimes would be varieties to be planted with almost any apples. In the case of an orchard already planted and not provided with suitable pollinizers, some remedy may be given. The only permanent remedy would be to top work part of the trees in the orchard at regular intervals to a variety which will provide pollen. In case the orchard is already in bloom, we might insure fruit setting by cutting branches from those varieties and putting them in buckets of water under the trees to ■ be . pollinated. If that is done, they must be dis - tributed throughout the orchard. It is not satisfactory to put branches in buckets of water close to the hives of bees, because the bees will I pass them up and not carry enough of the pollen to pollinate the orchard. • ■ ; In the case of our self-fru tful trees as peaches, we might think since the peaches will successfully pollinate their own flowers, they would not need any insects, to t ansfer pollen, because the flower parts am side by side, and it would seem pollination should occur. That is net the case.. Not enough of the pollen goes across to cause a satis - factory self-fruiting. They have investigated with prunes in California by screening certain trees which were self-pollinated by insects They set a crop of fruit of li.9 per cent, while those trees from which insects were excluded had three-tenths of one per cent of the blossoms set fruit. So even for the self-fruitful varieties, honey bees should be provided. \ ; </seg>
            <seg id="p490">IKPURT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In closing, I may say with practically all of our standard sorts of fmits, two or more varieties should be planted in a planting in re - gular order, putting varieties not more than three or four rows apart. In the second place, be sure to provide bees in sufficient numbers to transfer the pollen. Put one or two hives to every acre. (Applause.) Discussion THE PRESIDENT: I should like to ask if the Wancta plum is not self -f rrtilizing? MR. YOCUM: My knowledge of plums i.= not very great. Most American plums are self-sterile. They require cross-fjollinization. THE PRESIDENT: I should like to ask Mr. Marshall about it. MR. G. A. MARSHALL, (Arlington): I thing the Professor has as much information as is to be had in that line. We know the Waneta is wonderfully productive, but I have not studied the trees standing ! alone enough to answer that question. It is too productive. It breaks itself all to pieces. I should like to ask Professor Yocum what he thinks about the pollen on these hybrid plums — the sand cherry and plum cross, for instance; and also the Hanska varieties? There are three or four of those varieties being cultivated to some extent — the Hanska, Toka, •. Tokata, and Kaga. They are a cross between the Americana and the Prunus Simoni, and there is quite a difference in their bearing qualities. I am wondering if their pollen will pollinate other plums. What do you know about it? MR. YOCUM: Nearly all hybrids are sterile. Their pollen is not good. I do not know about these particular varieties. | MR. J. J. SMITH, (Omaha): I should like to ask about, the Jonathan apples. What do you recommend as a pollinizer for the Jonathan apple? MR. YOCUM: The Delicious or Grimes or Ben Davis are all good. A MEMBER: For the Wine Sap? MR. YOCUM: All of the varieties in the Wine Sap family are self-sterile. They do not produce good pollen. Those same varieties I have named will provide pollen for the Wine Sap, except the Grimes. MR.

            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTUKE SOCIETY MR. YOCUM: I do not Lean to say they are self-pollinizers.

The branches we place in the buckets should be in about the same stage of development. MR. SMITH: How long should the branches in the pail remain in a condition for pollinizing? MR.

His subject is "Advertising- the Apple." : . "ADVERTISING THE APPLE" MR. PAUL STARK, Louisiana, Missouri Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska Fruit Growers: I am not President of the American Pomological Society, but I am ex-Presi - dent. I am President of Apples for Health, Incorporated, which is a national apple advertising campaign. I am not prepared to give you a speech, but I think we can just get together and talk about adver - tising apples, and bring up certain points we. realize are before the apple industry. There is no use beating around the bush. It is a situation we must face. . </seg>
            <seg id="p492">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE About twenty years ago, when people spoke of advertising it cast a reflection on what was advertised. It meant it was a patent medicine or something not right. I believe it was President Coolidge who said, "The American people live by advertising." People who smoke cigarettes have been hearing about, "It hasn't a cough in a ■ carload." We expect to have a little competition from oranges and pine - apples and such things. But we have a corner on health. "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." Along comes a man in Cincinnati and gives the idea you can carry your health in your pocket in the shape of a little ■ yeast cake, and even sauer kraut is advocated. When the apple has competition like that and from other things, we must realize we are liable to go back rather than forward. The American dollar is just so big. If we do not fight for our share, some one else will get it. Personally, I think we orchardists all agree the apple is a fine product. The whole medical fraternity has recommended apples from a health standpoint. We have the most wonderful backing from experts and authorities, but we have not done anything to boost our own game. A year ago this fall when we had a large apple crop, a lot of us. woke up. We have been letting the other fellow do it, and as a re - sult no one doing it. To give you a little historical sketch, the American Pomological Society some years ago started a campaign for increasing the demand and consumption of fruits. A year ago in September a conference was called in Chicago under the auspices of the American Pomological Society, at which all apple growing sections were represented, and the matter of advertising apples nationally, like those other fruits, was brought up. The Apples for Health, Incorporated, was formed, with a national board with representatives from all sections of the country. They set about to unite the different apple sections to make them realize that, instead of Missouri fighting the east, and the east .fighting the central west, if they would join hands and -work together they could get somewhere. Briefly, what has been accomplished in the past eighteen months is that under this national association, all sections have realized in order to do the best for themselves, they must boost the apple. I recently read an article on the subject of advertising by a lead - ing man. He brought out this point: "Formerly it was Smith. against Jones. But times have changed. It is now industry through co - operation advertising collectively. The lumber manufacturers spend millions to fight wood substitutes. Wood shingles are pitted against </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA STATK HORTICULTURE SOCIETY composition shingles, and brass againt iron pipe, and brick against lumber. It is an era of co-operative advertising." It is the apple industry against the banana. You probably have seen something of this banana campaign, ' I think they are spending several million dollars a year on it. One of the big growers in Wena - tchee told me last summer when they had a tremendous amount of apples, those banana people sold carloads of bananas to those apple people themselves! It was nothing but advertising that accomplished it. That is the way the situation stands. The Association spent all of last year getting the eastern section of the country and the central wok lined up to join this movement and back it and unite and realize that each section was in the same boat with the other. All the apple people had virtually pooled their in - terests. ; Last winter Secretary .Gorby went to the northwest and laid the situation before the apple growers of that region. Later others went out and held a series of meetings in the different apple sections in the northwest. As a result, we now have all the northwest back of the campaign. As you know, tne northwest represents 50 per cent of the entire output of apples. It was important that the national as - sociation should have the backing: of this great apple producing region. They had planned a local campaign of their own to feature north - west apples. We explained we had the rest of the the country lined up and we wanted them to join us to feature the apple — its food and health value— and make people realize that if they ate apples they would not have to buy so many drugs; to teach the new generation what the generations before us knew and have begun to forget. This is what Mr. Jones, who is president of the Wenatchee Fruit and Distributing Company, writes: "Since the visit to. the northwest of the executives of the Apples for Health, Incorporated, at which time numerous meetings were held, there has been unanimous support of the movement. At the north - western meeting 1 , the growers and shippers approved and adopted this plan of advertising. . The norihwest believes this plan is the most practical and practicable plan Jfor increasing apple consumption ever considered by the apple interests. " "In addition to the support of the growers and shippers, we have also backing from, railroads, bankers, and business men, and the large amount of actual financial support in these groups will be a surprise to some people. We are anxious to join with our brother apple grow - ers and shippers in other sections, realizing each section is henefited by the tig increased consumption certain to follow." ■'■ . ■ ■■•'"■ •(■'■■■ ' ■ ■ .'■ . ■ ; ' " , .'■''. ■:.;■■ .■'.'■■. • - </seg>
            <seg id="p494">tEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATIC HOARD OF AGRICULTURK I want you to know how the northwest feels. Professor Hoppert and others went on a tour of the northwest two years ago, and you know what tremendous plantings they have and how important it is to have their support. I want to give you a general idea of how the situation stands and what is going to be done in the future. Last year there was considerable publicity that the Association carried on in the way of news articles in the press and advertising posters, etc. That was largely to bring all apple growers to a realization they must unite for a big, smashing advertising campaign. A little advertising does some good; but if you put on a big outstanding advertising campaign in competition to others, you can get somewhere. Mr. Miller is one of the leading advertising men of the country. His Company put over this "Say It with Flowers" campaign, and the Laundry campaign. You have seen the big bill boards with the laundry proposition. Possibly we get so close to this apply proposition we do not realize just what it really means. A man from the outside looking in can appreciate it better than we can. This is a letter written us November 10, 1927. Mr. Miller writes: "We have been connected with many advertising campaigns for advertising products; but I do not know of one that offers such a wonderful opportunity for outstanding advertising results as the apple. That is one of the main reasons we are interested. We feel funds invested in intelligent apple advertising will show as great or greater returns than funds invested in any other advertising campaign. "People are already sold, and it is just a question of reminding them. From observations made throughout the country, we know the apple industry is awake to this situation and is anxious to follow the same proven methods of modern salesmanship and put their industry on a permanently prosperous basis. It is just a mathematical problem. The increase in consumption of any product is in proportion to the amount of funds intelligently used through creating a demand for it by national advertising. It is such a large industry and so many peo - ple are interested, a big campaign can be put over without being a burden on any individual. Good co-operation and financial support will raise a fund to make it possible to dominate the fruit and food situar tion and make the slogan "EAT MORE APPLES" stand out in the minds of the entire American public. We are confident great success will follow the grasping of this opportunity." That is from an outside standpoint. He realizes what the apple is and what the opportunities are in advertising it along the same lines these industries have followed. </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIKT.Y In regard to the Miller arrangement, one of the big problems in any national campaign is a large organization that knows its business and knows how to raise money for advertising. There are so many people in the apple business— growers and shippers and allied indus - tries interested in seeing the apple growers make money. The problem is to get some organization that knows how to get funds from these different individuals, and then put on a campaign that will be out - standing. • ■ We looked over the situation and took it up with the national florists and laundrymen and others, and found it is the Miller Company of Indianapolis that did the advertising- for these people, but they had an organization to raise the funds, to put on a campaign. Selecting an advertising firm is like selecting a specialist for an operation. You want the man who knows the most about the game. We arranged with the Miller Company to take this proposition over, and they pre - pared and are now working on' a book that is practically like the book in the Flower compaign and the Laundry campaign, the Jewelers, etc. It is a form book adapted to apples. It goes to the fruit growers and shipper and allied industries. It has raised 20 million dollars in the last few years through the M Her Company. It is a proven proposi - tion. We know what it will do. They can take it home and sit down and actually go into details and know what is going to be done with every dollar of their money. (Here Mr. Stark showed sample pages of the dummy, reading the captions on each page, as follows:) "Join, to Double Apple Profits." A merchandising campaign to increase the national apple market. This first page shows the larger the crop, the less money is made unless something is done to increase the demand. People made more money this year with a smaller crop than last year with a bountiful crop. We have to face these facts There is such a tremendous opportunity that with co-operative adver - tising you can do what the orange people did.. Fifteen years ago the orange people had a crop that brought 12 million dollars. They flooded the market and thought they had reached the saturation point. Last year they sold 26 million dollars worth as against 32, and they had a shortage. They increased the demand and have all the doctors telling orange juice is good for pretty nearly everything that happens. They did not pay the medical men anything, to say that. The doctors feel the same way about apples. All we have to do b get ba-k of the campaign. ■ '.'■.■' : ! ■ . "Publicity Makes Money for -Other Industries."

Each section is represented on the national board, and it tells how the money is handled. ■ "Teaching Millions to Eat Apples Every Day." This brings out national' publications in which advertisements showing the use of apples will be featured. Here is one difference and one reason the Miller people are interested. In the Flower campaign, the man in i . ... .1 .l..i:-t \~. iiut interested ill the advertising campaign in Chicago or New York or Kansas City. He was interested in his own. In the apple campaign, every one of us growers ships apples to different markets. We want to see the apple prices in the big centers kept at a high level so that we can make a profit. It reflects on our crop. A lot of this money could be spent in the large consuming centers where the price of apples is set, and it would benefit every - body. We g-et better efficiency by concentrating in these larger produc - ing centers all over the country. "A Powerful Sales Drive." This is a sample newspaper advertise - ment. If one market gets flooded with apples, they will jump into the daily newspapers and get quick returns. Here is a typical recipe book sent to the housewife telling new ways of using apples. This is teaching the youngsters how to get the apple habit. They are good for recess and in between meals. H&lt;&gt;re are magazine and bill board advertisements and truck signs and other forms. Here is a page outlining how the money is to be raised on a per bushel basis with the growers, a per car basis with the shippers, and a quota basis from the allied concerns.

"A Million Dollars a Year Insures Success." I want to let you see what has been done, and want you to realize the entire sections of the country are back of it, and the longer it goes, the stronger it gets. I want you growers in Nebraska, since this is the first time we have had a chance to present this matter to you, to realize you have just as vital an interest as any other " grower in any other part of the country.

The bright side of the situation is that this is the first time we have ever gotten all the horses pulling together. If each will do his bit, it will mean we can put this thing over in a big way, and then we can do as the orange people did. Instead of turning a small crop into a surplus, we can turn a big crop into profit. We do not want prices so high people will not eat apples. We want the growers, year after year to make money.

THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Stark was put on the program ahead of the next speaker because he has to make a train. Discussion MR. W. B. BANNING, (Union) : I should like to ask Mr. Stark why it is that lately we have not seen advertising from the ■western fellows we used to see? Is it on account of the shortage of crop? MR. STARK: There is a short crop and they feel it -would be * best to retain their funds until another year when they will have a big crop. I think pretty nearly everybody realizes with the short crop this year, all things being equal, we will have another big crop . next year. I have been over the east. They all feel that way. That </seg>
            <seg id="p498">JEI'OKT OF XKBRASKA STATE riOARD OF AGRICl'LTCRK is one reason they have held off. The other reason is the fact they are retaining their funds to get into this national compaign. Instead of pushing their own individual brands, they can do more by putting their money into a campaign to sell apples and make people realize they must eat apples. As long as they do that, the people in Missouri will get their share. They have switched strong. They are for this big national campaign because they realize in union theycan get some - where. MR. BANNING: Could we have a few minutes more to discuss this? I have something on my chest I should like to get off. We have a great market for our own apples if we could get them to the people; but we have a lot of handicaps and some things we must over - come locally in this state. For instance, our constitution gives these cities a perfect right to make rules and regulations for selling fruit in those localities. If we want) to get apples into different towns, we are shut out unless we send our own individual trucks. The grocery - men in Nebraska and those fellows who handle fruit seemed to be combined against the Nebraska growers. In the first place, they are working from a selfish motive. They want to handle every bit of fruit that goes into their town. When we get ready to market our apples, if we want to send a truck into some smaller town, the local fellow does not want a load of apples. We must admit the truck is something coming in the way of transportation and sale of our fruit in eastern Nebraska. We will depend on it more than the railroads. We have good graveled high - ways and can transport one hundred miles and find a market for them. Here is where we are shut out. It might be a good idea for some of us to work on this proposition at home. If you want to sell a truck load they want to assess you from $20 to $35 a day. Take Fremont . with $30 a day. We must own the truck and the stuff. You must pay an occupation tax and give $30 a day to sell apples in Fremont. They shut this fruit out. What they want to get from hucksters is our culls and seconds, and they want them as cheap as they can get them. You can not sell first-class apples in those small towns. The grocers want to handle them at a profit. You can ship a car and get on the outside and take an order and deliver it from the car, but you can not deliver it, or sell to a huckster to deliver to the actual consumer. Later on the western stuff comes in. People will say, "Why can't we buy Nebraska apples in Nebraska?" I do a little advertising in the papers near by. If we could get the public in central Nebraska to understand these apples -are put out in eastern Nebraska, they will come and get them here. I think Mr. Stark's idea is a good one. It is all right. But we </seg>

I am going to send out my own trucks. These people are entitled to an opportunity to buy this stuff, and we are entitled to this market. MR. MARSHALL: I think both of those are all right. They are separate and distinct from each other. This , national campaign is to increase the demand for apples. That is the. idea. Good health and a fat- pocketbook and all. This other is a local affair. We should look after both of them. I. ■ • I should like to have some one offer a resolution approving of this national campaign, that we might have a chance to vote on it here. I should like to have our Nebraska Horticultural Society join it. SECRETARY HOPPERT: Can the whole Society join? MR. STARK: It is each grower. We would like the Society's support of course. We have had the' support of all societies where it has. been presented. Some of the societies have helped out financially, but we have gone to the individual members for five dollars per year. • MR. MARSHALL: . If the Society joined, our Secretary would get all the reports. ,1 -■ ■ \ ! ■ . MR. STARK: He gets them already. We want to give every in - dividual orchardist and shipper and grower a chance to receive these reports and be in close touci with the situation. Each individual can do a lot of good in his locality. There are a lot of activities we can .carry on to have a netwoik of support of this national movement working toward the end of eating more apples. MR. MARSHALL: I move it is the sense of this Society we apr ■ prove of the apple advertising campaign as outlined by Mr. Stark, and that all individual growers and shippers in this state be urged to join the national movement. The motion prevailed uranimously. MR. SHUBERT: I think Mr. Banning was right to try to fix it so we can sell these apples in different towns. I have had people come to our place and tell us they asked as high as $30 a day for the privilege of selling apples in certain towns. | They did not want them in there. It is a question as to whether this should be handled by legislative enactment or not. Of course the several city councils can ' make any law not in conflict with state law. It seems to me if we could get some further legislation that woud give the boys a right to -sell their stuff, we ought to do that. I do not think we ought to let it go over. Before we have our next meeting the legislature will </seg>
            <seg id="p500">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTl'RK be in session. We should organize and go down there and take this matter up before the proper committee and get something done. There are some points we should not forget. The President talked about zoning this state. It seems to me that should apply to taxation, too. When we go to got an appropriation for the Horticultural Society for the eastern part of the state, the western part will not be in favor of it. I think there should be lines drawn through this state, and especially along the eastern side, I think we could get appropriations if wo could zone the state for taxation. Let us get this ready so that we can do something a year from now. MR. CHRISTY: A person should sell his fruits wherever he wants to. I can not buy Mr. Shubert's apples. The trouble about legislation is this: we can not make legislation whereby we can sell Nebraska apples and can not sell Iowa apples just as well. There are some technical points to be taken care of. Frank Shubert can sell his apples, or send a man as his agent; but I can not buy his apples and then sell them in a town without paying a license. MR. SHUBERT: I do not have time to go out and sell them. The fellows come into our sections and want to buy apples. They will buy a truck load of apples and ask for something to show they ore selling our apples; and the next time they sell for somebody else and use our letter. It is a question whether -we ought to give those letters. MR. SMITH: This question has two sides. I live in Douglas county. The worst thing I have to contend with is the apples from outside Douglas county. They do not belong to Mr. Shubert. It is the Jews who take truck loads of apples from around Brownville and buy culls or seconds and haul them to Omaha Saturday afternoon. On Sunday they drive outside the city two or three miles and take a posi - tion perhaps right by my gate with a load of apples. He sets out a box of apples, he will sell at a lower price than I can sell my first - class stuff. I sell mine at the house. That is their stunt. I have never gone before the city council or had anything to say about it, but I know the situation. The grocers feel the. effects of this competition from these Jews. They pay no taxes. They wear out our -roads. We who own orchards in Douglas county pay a heavy tax. When you go to the legislature, you will have competition. If it could be. regu - lated it would be well. They are entitled to sell those apples. There is no question about it. But if Mr. Shubert or any other grower goes to Omaha with apples they sell them for the grade they are and at a price they are worth. When the apples get into the hands of these truck men, they rob the people. They are experts in loading a truck. My customers possibly came to my gate and buy these apples. There </seg>

ENRICH ORCHARD SOILS WHILE THE TREES GROW* PROFESSOR R. J. BARNETC, Manhattan, Kansas Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station Good management of the soil on which their trees are growing is, in the majority of orchards, the most important production problem . confronting Missouri valley fruit growers. On its correct solution, both the yields of fruit and the length of life of the orchard depend. The adoption of wrong methods of soil management leads to irregular and light average crops and to weakened and short lived trees. In contrast, the selection of a well adapted system will go far toward in - suring abundant,* annual crops and will tend to make an orchard what it should be/ a safe source of abundant income for two generations of owners. ♦Contributed No. 77 Department of Horticulture. 1 Orchard trees derive their nourishment .from only two sources. The first of these, the air, supplies oxygen and carbon dioxide and • * from these much the greater part of both the plants and their fruits are built up. But in order that the gases of the air may be used by the plants it is necessary that they be supplied through their roots with the second type of food, moisture and certain inorganic com - pounds from the soil. This supply must be continuous throughout the life of the tree. These other inorganic foods are of the type of nitrates, phosphates and potash. Orchard trees make a heavy demand on the soil for all of these nutrients but experiments generally in - dicate that shortages of nitrogen and water are the principal causes of poor growth and low yield in the case of the tree fruits. Skillful farmers would not expect to grow thirty successive crops of wheat on the same land without taking steps to maintain its fer - tility and the same principle would seem to constitute a safe guide for </seg>
            <seg id="p502">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE the orchardist, long lived and productive orchards are found only on fertile soils. Much of the virgin soil of the Missouri valley was suf- ■ ficiently fertile to produce a good orchard and carry it through to a ripe old age without the addition of fertilizers. But when soil of the same general type is sot to orchard after having produced 20, 30 or even 50 crops of grain, a very different condition must exist. Orchards on these depleted soils call for the best methods of soil management which the owner can devise. The Growers' Problem It would seem then that the fruit grower has two important things to accomplish through his method of soil management. They are (1) to increase and conserve the supply of moisture in the soil and (2) to maintain or increase the plant nutrients, especially the nitrogen, present in his orchard soil. All evidence indicates that these two are of primary importance and, also, that they and their effects on the fruit trees are closely related or interwoven. Even those who have made the longest and most intensive studies of this rela - tion seem unable to say, "these results are due to moisture relations and these come about because of the supply or form of nitrogen." Conservation of soil moisture for the use of the trees really in - volves one thing and that is the suppression of all other growing plants on the orchard land. If no weeds or crop is allowed to com - pete with the trees, especially during their time of heavy water requirement, the grower has followed the best practice for regions where summer drouths are likely to become a limiting factor in tree growth or fruit production. If the grower were to act as though every rain which falls between the middle of May and the latter part of August is to be the final rain of the season and that the soil must be so managed as to absorb as large quantities as possible and to con - serve it as long as possible the hazard of summer drouths would largey disappear. The amount of water which a soil will absorb as af - fected by its physical type and by the amount of organic material or " humus it contains. Soils composed of fine particles, though not so fine as to be the hard-pan type, and those containing large amounts of org-anic material and humus have good water absorbing and water holding capacity. The grower in his attempts to improve the moisture conditions of his orchard land cannot greatly change the size of the soil particles but he can rather readily increase its organic content. Clean cultivation reduces organic matijer while the incorporation of cover crops, crop residues or barn yard pianure in the soil increases it Orchard trees make a heavy demaiid for soil nutrient during the early part of the summer, especially in 1 the young orchard. It is at this season of the year, then that abundant nitrates should be available to the trees, free from competition witji other plants. This condition </seg>
            <seg id="p503">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY can be actually produced only by giving the orchard clean cultivation through this period, of rapid tree growth. The time during which this demand is strongest is shown for a rather typical year in figure 1. Twig. growth extends over a longer period than that is shown on young trees while cambial expension occurs through the whole growing season. Hence young orchard trees grow best when soil nutrients and moisture are abundant and available from early spring until late sum - mer. Figure 1 shows the rate of growth curves for a tree just com - ing into bearing. •HTT~H~I H | -H-f i-i-i-i ■[ n hiii || 1 1 (^fff i : [d±Er ±d= : -" :: BHE± :: ± ■ , i I ; . noURtnLRATtorcocwrH ~ u ~^— r~ — i — | — — ' ; K 1 — I WINEiAP Unz TREES ' * — ' — ' — ] — F~1 — I — ; ' 1 - i UK!

Cambial gTOWtli continued through the entire season. Orchard Cover Cropping Organic content of orchard soils can be maintained by adding animal manure or crop residues or by growing and plowing under cover crops. Animal manures in adequate quantites are now available for but few commercial orchards in this region. Hence the new im - portance of cover crops. Every fruit grower • recognizes that a young orchard does not fully occupythe soil of the land on which it is growing, and many of them consider the -unused pcirtion as being at least temporarily wasted. ; r - ■ ' ■/ ■ :■ </seg>
            <seg id="p504">RKI'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATIC BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ties are clean cultivation, sod culture, and cover cropping. A cover crop is a crop grown on the orchard soil between the trees and turned back into the soil for its physical improvement and, if the crop be a legume, its chemical enrichment. Whether it be a legume or a nori-legume it gathers plant nutrients from the soil during the fall while they ate still available but when the young: trees do not need them, and, the - oretically at least, returns these nutrients to the soil the following spring when the need of the trees is greatest. Fig. 2.— A general view of a young orchard planted to a cover crop of winter vetch. The vetch was drilled in the preceding- August and was plowed under April 20. Nitrogen added to each acre of this soil by the vetch would have cost about thirty dollars in the form of commercial fertilizer. A cover crop system of orchard soil management, with which, of course, must be combined clean cultivation for about four months, is best adapted to young orchards. The trees of older orchards too fully ' shade the ground to permit the successful use of cover crops. Because of this, it is probable that the organic material added to the soil is j • the most valuable contribution of the cover crop. In the final form, humus, it may persist for a long time after the trees become large and so stimulate activities of the soil flora and contribute to the forma - ion of available nitrate of which organic substances are the sole ulti - mate source. Plants for cover crops.— Cover crop plants lend themselves to classification on two bases: hardiness and botanical characters. The principal botanical basis is the ability of the plant to fix free nitrogen . from the air through the aid of certain bacteria which attach them - selves to the plants' roots. This is true of leguminous plants only. </seg>
            <seg id="p505">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Table 1 shows these characters for a number of the important kinds of plants which are adapted to cover crop use and have been tested in the station orchards at Manhattan.

            <seg id="p506">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Some additional discussion of the facts shown in Table 2 seems desirable. Wheat was discarded as a cover crop because it must be Planted August 15 to September 15 if a good ground cover crop is to he estabhshed before freezing weather. When planted at that time the Hessian fly attacks it, reducing the yield and constituting a hazard for near-by wheat fields. This insect does not injure rye. Dwarf Essex rape seems to deserve fuller test befor discarding. The seed lings died because of drouth during its one year test. In fact dry weather between August 15 and September 30 will much reduce the value of any of the tender cover crops.

Seeding may be delayed if the late summer is dry and the trees likely to suffer for lack of moisture, upon the cessation of cultivation. Rye or winter vetch may be seeded in dry soil but some of the other crops, as dwarf Essex rape and cowpeas, will germinate in soil too dry to sustain the seedlings. They should be planted only in moist soils. Young fruit trees tend to grow too late in the season so, among them, the cover crop should be planted early as its competition tends to hasten their maturity and dormancy. Young bearing trees may on the other hand need all available soil moisture and nutrients to mature their crop. The best calendar dates for planting seem to vary be - cause of these influences between about August 1 and September 10. Later sown cover- crops have, as a rule, been of very little value in the station orchard at Manhattan. Rates of seeding are given in Table 2. This question has been tested out for the winter vetch and the results shown in Table 3. Better stands are obtained if the seed is drilled in rather than broadcasted.

Considering the moisture I and nitrate content of the soil and the response of the trees, experiments indicate that the period of maximum growth while the stems of the plants still remain succulent should be chosen for plowing. This seems to be just about the time of first bloom for both winter vetch and rye. It will vary between late April and May 30. The drier the spring and the older the orchard the earlier the crop should be] plowed under. Tender cover crops may be turned under just before they are killed by frost, in early winter, or in early spring without measurable difference. Plowing at these times • .. ■"'-■-. . </seg>

Discussion Q. When do you plant the cow peas and when is the best time to plow them under? A. We have found the correct time to plant,— possibly it would be a little late for the eastern part of this state.-is the latter half of August. If we plant earlier and the trees have a crop, we in - terfere with the size of the fruit. In the young- orchard we can plant earlier, because it is desirable to have competition for the growing trees, particularly in the fall, in order to induce them to ripen up their new wood a little earlier than they are apt to do, especially in cultivate] land. From the fifteenth of AuRUJt on. is when we recom - mend the planting of iho cover crops. Tf the soil is dry, there is no use to plant cow peas and soy beans. Rape will germinate, and the seedlings will die if moisture is lacking. Any one of three times for plowing under is equally good. We could find no appreciable difference: just before the crop was killed by freeze in the fall; just after, and letting it stand, plowing it under the next spring. I like spring plowing because this stubble is a fine holder of snow and keeps it from drifting, as even rough plowed land will help." </seg>
            <seg id="p509">XEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Q. In your young orchard on bare ground, what will it be like if you plant vetch or cow peas at corn-planting time? A. In that case spring vetch would be used. Winter vetch is not adapted for the purpose. It rests from July first to the last of August. We can not follow that system' around. Manhr.Vav- because of our deficiency of moisture. In a region with aboundant moisture, some cover crop could be grown. We drill our rover crops and leav° in the field. We have good success with broad-casting and harrowing them in. The rape' takes between two and three pounds to sped an acre. In case of harrowed cover crops, we allow them to grow through the winter.' Rye and vetch are illustrations of this. The hardest pro - blem is to determine when to plow them under the next spring. We wish to get an abundant growth of organic mineral in the spring . before they are plowed under. But the trees are making their biggest, demand for soil -moisture and carbohydrate forming materials at this time. The twig growth is completed in about four weeks of the spring period. A younger tree grows through a longer period. If we plow it under early, we lose in the quantity of organic ma - terial turned under. If we delay the plowing under, the growing cover crop will compete with the tree, and decay will not take place in time so that this new formed plant food will be available for this heavy spring growth. The best time seems to be just as it is getting into bloom, whether it is vetch, a legume, or rye— a grass crop. Q. How many years do you recommend to follow this? A. That would ' depend on how poor your soil is to begin with. I think from three to five years, and at irregular intervals during the first eight or ten years of the age of the orchard. This would put the soil in condition to remain productive for a long period. With soil likfi curs, I' do not believe — following it every year, as long as we can have room to grow them, would be too- much. ■ Q. When using barnyard manure, do you scatter it around the tree ? A. We cover the whole surface, with trees from eight to ten years of age. When we plant the rye cover, we will have a circle where the rye cover crop does poorly, showing the distribution of the roots of the trees. Q. Using a spreader, you would spread it over the whole surface between the rows? A. Yes, sir. I have known orchardists to ; pile it around the trunk of the tree, which is the most foolish use that could be made of it. </seg>
            <seg id="p510">IF.I'OUT OF NBHUASKA STATK ROARD OF AGRICLTLTURE Q. Where corn will produce ten to fifteen bushels, would you think it advisable to prow corn in a young orchard more than a year after it is planted ? A. I think it is wholly an economic problem. If the profits from the turn will mean more to you than additional profit from the orchard twi nty-fivf years from now, 1 would say to grow the corn. ' The soil is depleted and the trees are injured from growing- corn between them. Whether this injury is more than the results you get is an individual problem, 1 think. The corn rows ought to be moved from the tree roots. I have seen corn planted so close they had upright growing trees. In order to get into the light, the trees grew straight up like a Lambardy poplar. Q. How about an orchard twenty-five years old? A. So far as I know, there are two methods: barnyard manure and commercial fertilizers. Q. How about throwing- straw on the ground without discing it in V A. That is beneficial, but somewhat slower than if buried. We have two rows of Delicious trees under straw mulch for six years. Up to the present time they have made the heaviest growth and yield of fruit of any Delicious trees we have. It means we put four inches of wheat straw over the surface of the soil every year. Don't cultivate in any other way. We put it on whenever we could get the straw. It co.-t one dollar a ton at first. Now it is two dollars a load. The faimers have found nut we want it. Cj. Discinjr makes a fertilizer as well as plowing? A. I think so. If the soil is loose, discing would be the better method. Q. Do you think it will do much harm to plow the area between the trees after they are ten or twelve years old, by disturbing the roots? Just occasional cultivation? A. [f you do not plow deep, little harm would be done. Every time we plow an orchard we cut many roots, but they will quickly reform and without great expenditure on the part of the tree. I would hate to make a general recommendation about plowing up the soil of an old orchard. If it is combined with other rejuvenation methods, such as pruning etc., I suspect it would be a good proposi - tion even in an old orchard to break up the sod. In hilly regions we must guard against erosion of the soil. That would lead us into another problem— the terracing of land and planting on contour. In </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY my opinion, there are orchard lands in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska, with excellent soil, where it would pay to terrace the soil before the orchard was planted and plant on contour so that we could cultivate. . ■ i ' ■ i Q. A good discing would probably be the better method when the ground is rolling. A. I think we have to avoid cultivating all of such land. There must be strips left that act as a dam to the run-off of the water — to spread it out and lessen the amount in any particular channel. It is a big problem, but not one I had planned to discuss here. Q. How often do you recommend putting on* this commercial fertilizer? A. You did not hear me recommending putting it on at all, did you? (Laughter.) When we. talk about commercial fertilizers for the apple orchard, we mean nitrogen. The chemist will say, "Your soil is sour." It isn't. Soil top sour for alfalfa is sweet soil for apples. If we want to grow a legume cover crop, you may have to sweeten -it to grow the legume. A commercial fertilizer is usually applied about three weeks before bloom. A good average application is five to six pounds per tree. This should be hand-scattered under the ends of the branch — a strip four or five feet wide. All those ef - fects are gone within probably. three months. Q. Is the potato "as good as corn as an inter-crop? A. I do not know of any serious objection to potatoes as an intercrop. In my experience, little apple orchard land is good potato land. Nearly all potato land is too poorly drained to be good apple land. If adapted, I would not hesitate to use potatoes for an intercrop. Q. Do you recommend sowing red clover in trees less than five years old? '. A: If the lay of the land would permit, I would keep wide strips cultivated under the trees up to five years of age. Following that, clover could come in. Q. Take a two-year-old tree. How close would you plant corn to that tree? A. Ten feet from' the trunk, I should think, on each side. I sometimes have observed the rule of starting with six feet on each side, and moving out two feet each year, which keeps away from com - petition between corn and tree roots. Q. ' In our orchards we kept them clean until the middle of July. • After that we had. a wonderful weed growth. The weeds got </seg>

I was wondering if those weeds would not be as. good a cover crop as we could get? A. In my opinion, they serve the same purpose as these crops. There is objection to them. If you let them go to weeds, obnoxious weeds are likely to come in that are not a desirable addition in the orchard. We could not do that at the Station orchard, and the same applies to a commercial orchard, because the looks of the matter arc to be considered, and a weedy orchard is not a thing of beauty; whereas a cover crop orchard is beautiful enough to put on a canvas. They (rather the blooms of this vetch to decorate banquet tables. Q. Here is our situation. If we want to plant vetch, we would have to cultivate our trees too late or we would have a great growth of weeds. A. Your cultivation must br carried on up until you plant your cover crop, so it can get a start with the weeds. If rye or vetch or cow peas will come up, they will compete with the weeds. Q. Would you plant vetch in an old orchard where there was bloom ? A. It would be good if there is room. It must have sunshine. If I needed to increase the fertility of the soil, I would keep on planting it. ' Ordinarily there is little room for it. &lt;■). Should a mature orchard be kept clean with disc and tractor? A. I can not give you a general answer. It is almost an in - dividual orchard problem. There are so many things that affected it. A man ought, I think, to get this idea; I am a fruit grower and will learn all I can in a general way of general relations applying to the care of the orchard, soil, etc., and then I will take this general knowl - edge and make specific application to my own condition. That is why Heston said the best fertilizer for an orchard is the footsteps of the owner. Q. You sow vetch as a cover crop. Will it die out? A. Y r es, it is an annual. Q. Do you get benefit from nodules on the roots? A. The first crop has to be inoculated with that specific bacterium. For future crops it lives over. We have blocks we have sown only once in five years. We left a four-foot strip in the middle of the row unplowed, and the cross cultivation was sufficient to distribute that before the time it sprouted in the fall. I had a good cover crop for five years. </seg>

This practice dries the ground out badly, but not as much as rye. It is ruined if you let rye ripen. Q. Is it worse than corn? A. Much worse. They are uncultivated crops, and the corn you cultivate and do not rob the whole body of the soil. Thank "you. I have enjoyed meeting with you very much. (Ap - plause!)

In January 1927 the Winter meetings of the Society were held at Lincoln in conjunction with Organized Agriculture. The first ' session was devoted to vegetable growing. Mr. E. H. Page of. Missouri was - securcd to discuss dusting as a method of control for vegetable pests. In addition local speakers \\ eve secured' to talk on other topics of in - terest to commercial vegetable growers. This was the first meeting of the kind held under the auspices of the Society and it is hoped that enough interest will gradually be aroused to get the vegetable growers to form an auxiliary of the State Horticultural Society. There were two sessions devoted to fruit topics and one devoted to ornamentals and windbreaks. The report of the meetings has just come from the printer and is available now. </seg>

Dinner was served by the Ladies Group of the Congregational Church at Brownville. Here a number of vineyards and orchards were inspected and then the crowd drove to the McCandless orchard where before inspecting the orchard the group was treated to refreshments on the banks of the Nemaha. The Moore orchard at N'emaha was the next stop and then came the Weaver orchard at Shubert. Finally in the late afternoon the group assembled at the Loess Company orchard just west of Shubert for some more refreshments' and a few short talks.

Some of the promising 1 new plums are Tonka, Radissan, Red Wing, Underwood, Monitor; cherries — Zumbra and Nicolet; apples — Haralson. Just how valuable these varieties will be here in Nebraska it is hard to say before trying them out. Nicolet cherry does not seem hardy. The Heralson apple is too poor to warrant a place in the orchard, but the Red Wing plum and the Tonka and Underwood seem to hold some promise for us. An interesting piece of breeding work being carried on is the plum and peach crossing. This cross is very seldom successful, that is only a few of the seeds produced from artificially pollenating plum flowers with peach pollen or vice versa, will grow.

The individual grower with a large volume of one variety should have room to stack about two car-loads of packed fruit while the com - munity house that packs many varieties must have enough space for packed fruit to permit assembling carloads of each of several varieties, perhaps simultaneously, unless cold or common storage facilities are available. Sizing machines vary considerably in the amount of floor space required for a efficient operation, some may.be successfully operated' in a space 20 feet long while there are others that require at least 60 feet. An individual grower or an association with a few members. that grow only a few varieties, with good shipping or storage facilities, /night be able to handle 500 barrels per day or a floor space of 4,000 square feet, while even 7,000 feet might inconvenience an organization with many growers that deliver many varieties. In general, it may be said that 5,000 to 6,000 square feet of floor space will provide room for efficient handling of 500 barrels of apples per day under average conditions. The packing house floor should be raised to the level of auto trucks and car floors, if adjacent to a railroad siding. Even though it may be necessary to use artificial light for portions of the day and on cloudy days, provision should be made for as touch natural light as possible. This may be introduced through continuous windows, just below the ceiling of the room, on all exposed sides of the building or by sky lights. Some provision must be made for storage of empty barrels, baskets and possibly other containers. This makes a second floor over at least a portion of the building a necessity in most cases. Various devices may be constructed for lowering the containers to the packing floor and to the place where they will be used. The second floor often provides better conditions for doing a portion of the stencil - ing. Perhaps the most important point to bear in mind when planning a packing house is to keep the fruit moving in one direction. Congestion means less output per unit of labor and greater cost of packing. The tree run fruit should enter one end of the house and the packed fruit leave the opposite one. This means that space shoud be provided for stacking tree run fruit at one end, placing the sizing machine in the middle of the house and stacking the packed fruit at the opposite end. </seg>

If apples are packed in barrels a hydraulic barrel press may constitute a part of the equipment. They are expensive but they enable a header to head 25 to 35 per cent more barrels per day. Grading and Packing Costs It is not likely that many middle western and eastern growers will adopt the west box as a container for apples because the returns for box packed fruit have not been high enough to justify the added ex - pense, except in cases where a grower has gradually worked up a special market. The bulk of the winter apples from Western New York are still packed in barrels. In Michigan, the summer, fall more tender winter varieties and even many of the varieties less susceptible to bruising move to market in baskets. Certainly, the tendency is to- </seg>

The Air-Cooled Storage ™ ., 5 J ech / nical "frigeration, or so-called "cold storage", is the ideal method of prolonging the life of perishable fruits, but the costs of construction and operation are excessive for the grower or growers with, less than 50,000 bushels of winter, fruits. Ordinary cellars may be frost proof but the fruit seldom keeps well because there is usually no provision for quick cooling of the fruit in the fall; the winter tem - peratures are frequently too hW to prevent the growth of decay organisms; the fruit, may shrivel and conditions are often favorable for scald development. The common or air-cooled storage is designed to overcome some of the serious faults of the common cellar. The essentials of an air-cioled storage are insulated walls and ceiling, a number of cool air intakes just above the ground o r floor level on all exposed sides of the building, one or more ventilators or warm air outlets and doors for both the intakes and outlets which may </seg>

All opening must be tiphtly closed when outdoor temperatures are higher than these in the storage room, but when the temperature of the outdoor air is lower than that in the storage room, both the air intake openings and the outlet flues should be opened to permit the warmer and lighter air of the storage room to pass out through the outlet flues and an equal volume of the colder outdoor air to enter the loom through the air intakes. The fruit is thus cooled by passing cooler air about it and is held at a low temperature by preventing warmer air to come in contact with it. The temperatures maintained in an air-cooled storage during the fall months tend to follow the seasonal outdoor mean temperatures. If the storage is well managed, a storage room temperature three to six degrees lower than the average mean daily outdoor temperature may be contemplated. Our average monthly mean temperatures in Southern Michigan are: October 51, November 39 and December 28. We can expect the temperature of the fruit to be reduced to 32 degrees Fah - renheit by the last week in November or the first week in December and from that time until spring the storage room of a well constructed building may be maintained at 32 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit, even though the outdoor temperatures drop to -12 degrees for two or three days at a time during the winter. Your average mean monthly tem - perature at Nebraska City are: October 54, November 40 and Decem - ber 27. Thus your average mean October temperature is three degrees higher, your November mean is essentially the same and your Decem - ber mean is slightly lower than ours. Your mean minimum temper - atures for the months, however, are slightly lower than ours, so that you could anticipate about the same rate of cooling as in Michigan. Apples have been under the observation of the Michigan Experi - ment Station in many storage houses during the past six years and winter varieties have kept satisfactorily in well constructed and well managed houses each year except possibly this season /when fall tem - peratures were exceptionally high until about the first of December. The fact that dozens of new houses are built each succeeding year and that one of our fruit exchanges has just completed a 50,000 bushel building- expresses the confidence that Michigan growers have in air - cooled storage. Construction of the Storage The storage room must be sufficiently insulated to prevent freezing during the coldest weather that may be anticipated. Your mean mini - mum winter temperatures differ but little from Michigan's. The amount of insulation usually provided mechanically refrigerated rooms is not necessary for air-cooled storage houses because mechanical re- </seg>
            <seg id="p525">NEBRASKA* STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY fyigeration is expensive while the only expense involved in cooling the. air-cooled storage is the labor involved in opening and closing the in - takes and outlet doors. Frame wall construction i is not satisfactory because the humidity of^a storage room must be sj&gt; high that wood is inclined to warp and rot. Concrete absorbs moisture and has a rather high rate of heat con - ductivity. The air spaces in ordinary tile are so large that a double wall must be used to provide sufficient insulation and this involves too much expense. Interlocking tile is laid up in such a manner that there are five small horizontal air spaces in a 12 inch wall. Further - more, mortar joints (mortar has very poor insulating properties) are - broken twice in the width of these walls, thus preventing the entrance of frost thrpugh the mortar. These walls must be waterproofed by plastering both the inside anfl outside with a 1:2 cement plaster. In two or three instances we have erected two-inch furring strips inside the tile wall and nailed a laj/er of "Celotex" to them. This interlock - ing tile type of wall construction has been used more than any other kind of material in storages that have been built since 1923. The joists for the ceiling of the room should be placed so that their tops are one or two inches below the top of the wall. If the ends of the joists rest on top of the wall, some difficulty will be ex - perienced in preventing the entrance of frost. We prefer to use either i"Celotex" or lath and wood pulp plaster underneath the joists. Neither will absorb much moisture and both are long lived. There are several good ways of providing additional ceiling insulation. Three inches of materials known as "Thermocrete" or "Insulex" may be poured between the joists and the joists covered with matched boards. If "Celotex" is used beneath the joists, another • layer may be laid above the joists and this covered with water proof paper and matched boards. Another satisfactory method is to lay an inch of hair felt or other similar materials of like thickness above the joists, then waterproof paper and matched boards. All doors must be insulated. They may be made by placing three of four layers of "Celotex" between matched boards. Another satisfac - tory method is to build a box like door using two-inch material for the edges and one inch matched boards for the two sides. A four inch space between the boards may be stuffed with hair felt, oiled shavings or crushed cinders. The edges of the doors should be beveled to fit tightly against door frames buveled in like manner. Dirt floors are the most satisfactory because they help to maintain the proper humidity (about 85 percent relative humidity) in the storage room. Concrete or wj&gt;od floors result in considerable shriveling of the fruit unless water is added to the room rather frequently. </seg>

In general, it is not advisable to plan a width of more than 40 feet unless forced ventilation is to be used. From the stand - point of convenience in handling the fruit, the width should be at least 2J feet. The length may he such as will provide the necessary capa - city based on two and one-half cubic feet for each bushel. Ventilation of the Storage Tho cold air intakes are window like openings located at or near the ground line on two to four sides of the building. They should be IS tn 20 or more inches high and 24 to 30 inches long. The number of intakes is determined by computing the number of cubic feet in the storage room and dividing this amount by 700. In general, there should be one 18 by 30 inch intake for each 1000 bushels storage capacity. The warm air outlet flues should extend from the ceiling of the room through the roof. The upper end should be covered to prevent the entrance of rain and snow but the cover should not in - terfere with the "draft" or free exit of the air. The various patented ventilators are satisfactory but they are quite expensive. There should be one square foot of outlet flue for each 1200 cubic feet of storage room capacity or two square feet for each 1000 bushels storage capacity. Small outlet flues do not permit a free movement of the air. They should never be smaller than 30 by 30 inches. For a 10, - 000 bushel house, two ventilating flues, each 36 by 42 inches are pre - ferable to three flues, each 30 by 34 inches. Such proportions for in - takes and outlets provide about three air changes per hour in the storage room under average conditions and this normally reduces the temperature of the fruit about one degree per night. Motor driven fans increase the volume of air movement through the room but the cost of installing and operating them is high com - pared to the cost of increasing the number and size of air intakes and outlets sufficiently to produce the same volume of air movement. We use them in one large storage where intakes could be located on only the south and east sides. Placing the fans in the north-west corners of the rooms enabled us to pull the cold air across the rooms and thus bring it in contact with all the fruit. The cost of construction of above ground, interlocking tile wall, ( storages of 5,000 to 20,000 bushel capacity has been 40 to 50 cents per I bushel of storage capacity. The cost has varied with the size of the structure, the number and kinds of accessories and the height of the j roof above the ceiling of the storage room.

A copy may be had by addressing the Department of Horticulture, Michigan State College, East Lansing, Michigan. Diicuition Q. In what manner are the culls fed ? A. If the floor of the packing house is elevated above the ground like this floor, I like to make a hole in the floor and run those cider apples into a basement room. Perhaps you can back a truck in and haul to the cider mill. If not, let them run into some sort of a conveyor and be conveyed into a bin where they can later be hauled to the cider mill. Get them out of the way just as quickly as possible. Four to six thousand square feet of space with the one shown here is necessary. Q. What do you understand by cider apples? A. As a matter of fact, we have two unmarketable grades. One is known as "Canner stock," which consists of apples larger than two and one-half inches, but having some imperfections such as being knobby, which does not permit their going into the second grade. Then we have the cider grade, which may consist of smaller apples, or apples blemished so that they can not go to the canner. Q. Any rots? A. No. Q- How long in those big plants do they cool apples before they are packed. A. I only know of one fruit exchange with a pre-cooling cold storage room. They built that to help out with strawberry and raspberry fruits. Q. How about storing such fall varieties as the Jonathan? Would it be satisfactory? We pick these about the middle of September, Grimes, Jonathan, and Delicious. </seg>

You can hold until the average temperature rises somewhat above ( freezing. Your average September temperature at Nebraska City is 66 degrees. Ours is 63 degrees. We seldom put any fruit into storage before the first of October. I make this suggestion. At that season of the year if you pile your fruit in the shade outdoors, it will keep nearly as satisfactorily as in storage. When your storage is below 50 degrees, move this fruit in early in the morning and you can get your storage room temperature down earlier. Ordinarily we have 32 degrees storage by the last' week of November. This has been our poorest air-cooled storage season since 1921. Q. Have you any special service for entering your apples day by day- without letting in so much hot air? A. In practice, we move fruit-in whenever it is picked. Theoreti - cally, it is better to let it stand in the orchard until morning and haul the cool fruit into the storeroom. Q. Have you something 1 that would avoid letting in hot air? A. We have not done piat. All these storages are built above ground. We have some partly below, but we have difficulty in con - trolling winter temperatures. Above ground storages are cheaper to build. Q. Would there be any advantage in underground storage to run the fruit in after it was picked, before, packing? A. We sort our orchard run. We pack it as we sell it It is easier to handle and speeds up fall operations. The average cost of construction has been forty cents per bushel of storage capacity. Q. What are these crates composed of? A. We have a good many different kinds. They are all made of i rough, unplaned, hard, wood., about three-eighths inch thick and ont&gt; and three-fourths inches wide. They hold a little more than a packed bushel. They are usually about 16 inches square and 12 inches high. Q. Do you have knowledge of any storage house with supplemen - tary cold storage attachment? Here we have the proposition of grow - , ing Jonathan and Delicious. We have no means of cooling them. j A. Some of our growers have made provisions so that they could use a few tons of ice in the fall for quick cooling, or install mechanical refrigeration, later. None has done it. </seg>

Out in the west I saw a co-operative plant that had big con - ducting pipes like a warm-air furnace, with little slots in the bottom. A larue ammonia plant generated the cool air which was forced around to the different rooms. They had big storage rooms for the orchard run apples and would pack and ship up until Christmas. A. They could blow the cold air to different rooms? Yes, the cold air is blown down over the stored apples similarly as lettuce and small fruits are precooled. Q. I was wondering if you had knowledge of any one using that type for summer or early fall varieties? A. Oui trvowers have been successful with the air-cooled storage nearly to the Ohio River. That far south they have had a little dif - ficulty. There must be three or four dozen such storages in the south - ern part of Ohio. Q. May 1 ask if they practice any sorting before putting them into storage? Do they take out mechanical bruises? A. They speed up operations as much as possible. No, the apples go into storage as they come from the pickers. Q. If the basement is partly below and party above, are the ventilators above the ground ? A. Just above the top of the ground. Q. Have you figures to give us of the ratio for ventilators? A. One 18"x30" intake for each 2500 cubic feet of storage room; and two square feet of outlet flue for each 2500 cubic feet of storage space. We have not used fans to accelerate the movement of air ex-, cept in this large 50,000 bushel storage.

            <seg id="p531">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY "THE 1927 SPIAY TESTS AT SHUBERT" MR. E. H. HOPPERT, State College of Agriculture, Lincoln The profit in apple growing in eastern Nebraska depends in a very great measure on the success .with which the grower controls the codl - ing moth. A man may grow good trees and be very good at marketing his crop but unless he is abls to control the pesky little worm he will soon be a "has-been" orcharlist. Therefore it behooves him to study the problem. And believe me, it is not as simple as adding two and two either. In some section! ; thorough spraying 10 or 12 times won't do it. When some of our powers heard the remarks of a Kansas grower at the Fruit Show at Kansas City recently one of them re - marked "Thank goodness my orchard is in Nebraska and not in the Arkansas Valley." I agree heartily with these sentiments. But let us not fall into a rut. Let us keep abreast of the times. The codling moth does and that is why he is hard to control. He is fighting for his very existence and a beautiful scrap he is putting up, too. He seems to try different tactics in different years. If he has brains he is sure using them for something besides a hatrack. In order to help out witl control measures for the codling moth the Horticultural Department and the Extension Service are carrying on some tests at Shubert in the orchards of Art Shubert and one of the Loess Land Co. The former is an old orchard which lias previously been badly infested with -worms. Last year (1926) the spray tests were all carried out in the young orchard just west of Shubert Some of the growers objected, saying that it is easy for most anyone to produce relatively clean fruit in a young orchard where the infestation is usually light. This year ve took on the old orchard, too. We found that the problem is far more difficult. This old orchard has about half a stand of trees, most of them Jonathans over 30 years old. Conditions here are favorable for the worms. There are hiding places galore. The trees are very tall and rather hard to cover well. The orchard is in sod. We know what we were up against and therefore made special efforts to do a good job of spraying, using- as high as 20 gallons of material to cover some of the trees, the average, however, being between 10 and 15 per applica - tion. Different schedules aid different materials were used. There were two rows to each plat except in the case of the three west plats which consisted of one row. All of the plats were given a pink appli - cation and a petal fall or calyx application. The first cover spray was timed according to moth emergence in the cages and proper tempera - tures for egg laying. All of the plats were given this application also. Plot A was given one cover spray per brood, using 3 pounds of Lead Arsenate per hundred gallons of water and no spreader. </seg>
            <seg id="p532">IF.PORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AQBICl'LTl'KK Plot r.— 2 spray? per brood using lead avsenate 4 to 100 and sp reader. Plot C— 3 dust.-' per brood using the sulfur arsenate dust. Plot D— P, sprays per brood — lead arsenate 4 — 100 and spreader. Plot E— 3 spray.- per brood, 1 gal.

Plot X2 — 3 dusts per brood using sulfur arsenate dust. Plot X3 — 3 dusts per brood using copper arsenate dust. The plot given only one spray per brood and the three dusted plats were the poorest of the lot, over 50% of the apples being wormy. Right here I want to say that Art Shubert was a pretty good sport not to have offered complaint at the apples lost through worms because of the lack of proper spraying. Probably 100 bushels of Jonathans went into the cull pile inst^id of into th? car simply because of poor control. In discussing the results Art said "you certainly won't have to repeat that part of tip experiment again next year. One year's results ought to show plainly enough that it won't do." And I can't say that I blame him either. Putting on only one spray per brood is rather risky, too, especially in an old orchard. There were almost as many apples injured by worms as in the dusted plats. Two sprays per brood did fairly well but even here the propor - tion of damaged fruit was too high, namely 39%, 28% of which «ere stings. The plat that seemed to give the best control was the one on which one gallon of Volck oil and 2 pounds of Lead arsenate were used. Here the damage from wormy apples was only 4% whereas 21% were stung. The next best plat was one on which Lead arsenate at the rate of 4 pounds to 100 gal. of water were used together with % pound of caseinate spreader. In placing weight upon these results we should take into account the amount of infestation. The fact that the dust gave such pnnr control affects the whole schema of things. Let me co into detail. We had two plats where lead arsenate 4 to 100 with spreader was used- One of these had a dusted plat to the west of it. Here wo found 13% of the applos wormy but 59% of them were stung-. In the other plat where sprayed plats were on both sides we had 12% wormy and 19% stung. By the way the Volck plat was likewise favored by not having dusted plats next to it. For this reason I would go slow on laving in a stock of Volck. Per - haps if the conditions had boen reversed the Volck plat might have had more worms. In next years tests we will drop the dusts and the one per brood spray. . I </seg>
            <seg id="p533">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY One of the things that we will want to try out is the use of an oil spreader in the first brood :over sprays. Some of our growers used them this year and : found tt at they certainly caused the lead to stick. However, if used on the latj sprays they may injure the finish of the fruit. Those of you who U-ere on the tour we held in August will remember that oil spreadeJ had been used for the second brood in August in the Moore orchard at Nemaha. Wherever drops of spray had dried on the colored cheek of the apple, there the skin failed to color properly so that the apples had a blotched appearance. We noticed that the same thing: on the Missouri Pippin Variety in our test plats where Vokk was used Therefore I would suggest that oil spread - ers be omitted late in the season. Another thing about these oils; don't figure that because a little is good a lot is better. In one of the orchards visited ll/ 2 gallons per 200 gallons had been used in - tead of 1, as recommended and here the leaves and fruit were badly burnt. If then any of you have old orchards where the infestation is heavy, here is my recommendation: Use 4 lbs. of lead arsenate to 100 gallons in the calyx application. Then use the same strength and % gallon of an oil spreader in addition per 100 gallons for each of 3 cover sprays. The first cover spray should be determined by cages and moth traps and a careful watch of temperatures after the moths begin to appear. Make the application right after the temperature goes to 60 degrees Fahrenheit at 8 :00 p. m. Then make the next two appli - cations at 2 week intervals. The second brood usually comes on about the first week of July. Make another application at this time again using 4 pounds of lead ars«nate to 100 gallons of water. But do not use oil at this time. Another spray might be put on 2 to 3 weeks thereafter if the infestation is bad. This ought to be sufficient under Nebraska conditions, especially if a thorough' job is done. Use plenty of material and coat the pranches and trunks. Remember that the worms do not have to eat the lead to be killed. It has been found that merely crawling through or over the material will kill quite a lot of them. The lead arsenate .residue question has aroused a lot of interest Unless we spray late in August and use oil spreader there ought to be little residue left after the fall rains have gotten in their work. Wiping machines evidently have not proven effective in removing the residue in the west. Then: they have resorted to washing the apples in a weak hydrochloric acitl solution. This method is not satisfactory we were told at Kansas City. Some of the people in touch with the situation claimed that 50% of the apples that were washed and put into storage had to be dumped in the Missouri River because they began to rot We hope that we will be spared the necessity of wash - ing our fruit. </seg>

The tests this year gave very good results in nearly all plats except where onlv one cover spray per brood was used and where the calyx application was omitted. Here, too, the dusted plat showed move injury than we like to see, namely 12% The best plats were the ones on which lead arsenatc 4-100. and 1 gallon of Volck were used. The plat sprayed ■ With Volck, however, showed considerable russeting. The check trees in the you™ orchard .showed about 20% wormy where the wormy apples were picked off. In the cage where this was not done 26% of ' the apples were wormy. An interesting thing about the caged tree that ought to be re - ported is that scab was much worse than where the check tree was not caged. The conditions under the cage evidently were more fa - vorable for scab development than out in the open. In the case of young orchards it seems comparatively easy to control worms. But as the orchards increase in age the problem becomes increasingly more serious. Therefore it would seem advisable to use precaution to keep ahead of the worms. Spray thoroly even when there is a light crop TVo cover sprays for the first brood seem sufficient in a year such as 1927 but in a year that is more favorable for worms I would rec - ommend three covers. The idea is to cut down the number of first Drood worms to a minimum so that the iatev broods will cause no =enous damage. So much for the worms. Every commercial grower ought to be sufficiently interested in the codling moth to study its life history and its development each year _ for each year conditions vary and with them the life history ol the insect. Cage up 50 or 100 of the worms early in the spring. The easiest way is to band 8or 10 trees with burlap along in August. Another way is to examine orchard barrels and cull bins for the larvae. A glass jar covered with cheese cloth will serve as a cage. Flace this jar under a tree in the shade. When 10 or 15 of these nave hatched and the temperature has reached 60% at 8:00 P. M. then put on the first cover spray. Another method to determine when the moths are out is to place a pint of cider in a small pail. Put in a tablespoonful of brown sugar and a cake of yeast. Then fasten it up in the top of a tree. A convenient arrangement is to place a screw eye high up in the tree, attach a small pulley to this; tie a long cord to the pail and run the cord thru the pulley.

To be sure what the codling moth looks like, plaeu a few of the worms in a covered jar in the house during the late winter and watch what happens. You won't easily mistake him when you see Trim the next time. It is best for each grower to go to this trouble himself in order to play safe. We will continue the spray service as given the past two years but sometimes local conditions may differ from those where, the observations are made. We will have Mr- Mapes at Union make observations the coming year so as to check up on the condi - tions in this locality. Scab this past year made it.; appearance in spite of the fact that the two previous years were extremely unfavorable for its development. In fact some growers felt that the pink or cluster bud spray need not be applied. Later on it was found that con - . . siderable scab had developed. Pathologists tell us that something new has been found out about scab, namely that it can live on dead leaves for several years and when conditions become favorable it • . will spread to the trees. It certainly must have worked that way this year. It may seem li ce a waste of money to keep spraying . for scab each year when we so seldom have serious outbreaks; but it. will pay frequently enough i;q warrant making the cluster bud spray a regular and an annual affair. ■ :■ ' . ■1.--V '•■•&gt;■ ■ ■ ■ '. '. ■ Frog Eye During the past year still another fungus trouble was evident in a few orchards, particularly on the Jonathan variety, — namely frog eye. This spot is easily identified, being brown for the most part, with concentric rings. The margin of the spot is purplish in color. Infected leaves drop prematurely, thus weakening the buds for the following year. The organism that is responsible for the injury is the same one that produces black rot on the fruit and limbs. It lives over on dead limbs and in cankers and wounds. Here small black pimple-lip growths are produced which in the. spring expel the spores. These spores can grow thru the surface of tender leaves but late in the season, can only enter leaves thru wound. Ordinarily the regular scab sprays will control frog eye very easily. Either lime sulphur or Bordeaux may \&gt;2 used as fungi - cide. In order to make control by sprays easy, it is well to 'remove dead limbs and small cankered limbs. Where large limbs aTe can - kered it is well to. trim oft the diseased, bark and paint the wound with a good tree paint. In conclusion let me say that we had better stick close to the present methods of control ing our worst pest, the codling moth- </seg>

Lately other methods of controlling pests have been advocated, for example, vaccinating trees, and from the Wenatchee section comes a method suggesting the use of bats, not baseball bats but the animals that fly at dusk and feed on insects that fly at that time. Until we know more about other things let us keep our spray outfits in good shape and use them as often as necessary. Watch the development of the moth with cages and cider traps and spray thoroly. Use oil spreaders early in the season if at all. Try to get good control of the first brood so you won't have to spray too late in the season. The spray residue is receiving lots of attention and publicity. We hope our section never has to take measures against the residue. But in the meantime watch some of the other sections where methods of removal are being tried. We may have to use some such method some day. In apple growing as in many other industries the saying is true, "Eterna? vigilance is the price of success." I thank you. Discussion Q. What kind of oil spreaders did you use? A. We used no oil spreaders the past year. Calcium caseinate was the spreader used. Q. You did not use lime and sulphur with Volck, did you? A. No, we did not. We used lime-sulphur when the buds showed pink, and omitted it the rest of the season. You can not use oil with lime and sulphur. You must use Bordeaux if a fungicide is necessary and you wish to use Volck. Perhaps some day we will have dusts that are desirable, because they simplify our spraying. I spent in our own orchard this year a thousand dollars putting in equipment to convey water to the tops of some of the hills. We must have water and if we can put it to the tops of the hills it will save time. With dusts, we would not have to have that. I would prefer to use dusts if I had confi - dence in them. I will have to be shown better results than we secured before I will invest in a duster. Would you trust the dust - ing method for controling insect and fungus pests, Mr. Porter? MR. GROVE PORTER, (Nebraska City): I do not believe I would at present, tho I am going to try it again on a small scale next year. A. With our spraying experience, I am not convinced it is a good thing. MR. PORTER: I think every orchardist who has over fifty acres should have a duster for emergencies. Say you have a lot of rain. </seg>

Your fruit takes on a better finish. But at present I am not sure about it. We use both liquid and dust, and used the duster when our sprayer was on the bum. A. You do not have complicated equipment — no hose or noz - zles. It is simpler and lighter than the sprayer. MR. PORTER: I think' another, important thing with the duster here is our climatic conditions. Whenever we have sprayed with a liquid sprayer, the wind is blowing. In using the duster, we had to start about three o'clock ; n the morning and dust until about nine o'clock. Lots of times tie wind would be blowing too strong by seven o'clock. I think the duster would be all right if it wasn't for the wind. I think it will get the worms, but you can't put it on right unless it is absolutely quiet. When it is still, the dust will float around the tree a long time. A. We never had that kind of conditions, and we started early, too. Occasionally you will have it still, but every so often you would get a gust of wind that made it impossible to do a good job. Q. If you want to watch results the coming season, the Iowa State Department is conducting experiments at Missouri Valley. A. We have worse conditions than they have. TJhey can get along with one cover spray for worms. We have to put on at least two. I would rather compare notes farther south where conditions are worse so far as codling moth is concerned. Q- Nebraska City isn't so far away. • Q. What pressure dc you use in spraying? - A. Two hundred fifty to three hundred pounds. We have high-pres - sure pumps on our sprayers. We have not tried that new system, of blowing both air and spray material out of the nozzle at the same time. I think a man in Missouri is operating an outfit of this type. He uses it at' low presure. It works a good deal like an atomizer. It dusts the material on, but there is a little liquid with it. Q. Can you see dust on the trees any length of time? .A. It will stay quite a long time, but it does not stay on the fruit very well, it stays on as long as there is a little fuzz on the fruit. ' Q.

A. I am wondering whether the Company could not profitably use- a larger percentage of lead in proportion to sulphur? There is no particular need for sulphur in the middle of the summer. Q. You can make it any percentage you want to. A. Perhaps that would be the thing to do. We do not know enough about it to make recommendations. I am not satisfied I am sure it cost Mr. Art Shubert $150 to know that the dust was no Rood. He did feel we should try it again next year. But he was a good sport about the year's loss. Q. You recommend four pounds arsenate of lead to one hundred gallons. How much lime sulphur? A. It would vary with the different sprays. Start in with one - and one-half gallon* to 50 when the buds show pink. The first ap - plication is not a worm application. If you have lots of curculio, use two pounds of lead arsenate to 50 in the first spray. It does no harm, but is not usually needed very early in the season. For the petal fall spray, use one and one-half gallons of lime-sulphur and 1 k pounds of lead arsenate to fifty gallons of water. It is concen - trated in the calyx cups, and one and one-half pounds to fifty gal - lons would be sufficient. When you begin on your cover sprays get those worms before they get to the apple. Q.

The manufacturers recommend one gallon to one hundred • gallons but we cut it in hslf. Two gallons to a tank is too much. It costs about fifty cents a gallon. About the latest time to use it is in the first cover spray for the second brood. In fact this is getting dangerously late. You are getting into July with the second spray and some varieties are beginning to color.. The oil causes a blotched color effect that is undesirable. Q. Do you have trouble with arsenate of lead clogging up and turning to dough? A. Any brand will do that if you do not have a good agitator on your spray outfit. Some have a paddle at each end and spray material will tend to settle out at the center of the tank. I think if you -had another paddle attached in the middle, you would get better agitation. Q. One brand would leave a deposit of nearly two gallons of dough in the bottom of my tank, and the other, using the same strength of machine and pressure, came out clean. A. We used different brands. None seems to have that trouble. In 1925, we used as high as twelve pounds and did not have much sediment. Q. Isn't there a difference in the water? A. Yes; but using the same water, there should not be a dif - ference. Some leads may work better in certain kinds of water. Q. Did you strain the lead? A. I did not I mixed it and used them just alike. Q. Perhaps you could ciange.the position of the agitators. A. Most brands of leac. ■will stay in suspension for a few minutes without any agitation whatsoever. We find that some growers mix their spray materials at a jtank and shut off the engine -while driving a half mile before spraying. In such cases the lead has a fine chance to settle out and is not entirely brought into suspension when the engine is started. i ■ . . </seg>
            <seg id="p540">UKl'iiUT nK NEUUAKK.V STATK UOAHb OF AQRIIHM.Tf!!K PROFESSOR SVENK: I learned something which may interest others here. Recently, results were given of tests made during the pa.st season regarding the resistance of codling moth larvae to arseni - cal.s. Every one knows that in different localities this resistance varies. That is largely the basis of the difference in spraying programs. A program that works nicely in one locality may be applied in another with disastrous results. The codling moth larvae in different localities have varying resistance to arsenicals. This has been definitely proved during the past year. The codling moth larvae from western localities have been placed under identical conditions with eastern larvae. The eastern larvae died while the western ones did not perish. The two were hybrids and the test showed an anomaly, indicating that although the two insects are structurally identical, there are two physiologic strains developed, one of which is receptive, and the other only miHly so. In Nebraska we are between the two, and our problem is one that will have to be worked out locally. Regarding the bats, that program of natural control is being dis - cussed some. Unfortunately, we do not have in Nebraska anywhere those colonizing species which have been propagated for codling moth control in the north-west and in Texas. We can hardly look at that as being of value to us. To import them is of questionable value. On motion, adjournment was declared until 9:30 o'clock Thursday morning. THURSDAY MORNING SESSION January 5, 1928 The final session of the convention was called to order by Presi - dent Davidson at 9:45 on Thursday morning, January 5. . THE PRESIDENT: The first number on our program this morn - ing will be a talk by our State Superintendent of Schools, Mr. Taylor, or "Nebraska Needs a Forestry Program." "NEBRASKA NEEDS A FORESTRY PROGRAM" Mr. Chas. W. Taylor, State Superintendent of School*, Lincoln Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I want it distinctly under - stood I am not a specialist in horticulture or forestry.

            <seg id="p541">. NEBRASKA. STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIKTY and forestation. Just now the departments at Washington are giving attention to the subject of forestation and the 1 flood control of the . Mississippi valley basin. Th;re is a movement on foot for the ex - penditure of hundreds of mi lions of dollars for flood control in the Mississippi valley. The danger in this program upon which we as a nation arc cm - barking is that the expenditure of these sums of money may be taken up by our lawmakers from the standpoint of a pork-barrel proposition for the benefit of the political party in control of the governmental machinery. It takes about forty years to reforest a given area — to develop a forest from the time the seedlings are planted until ready for com - mercial use. Inasmuch as evjery one is agreed that the problem of re - forestation is one phase of this flood-control situation, it would seem ■ we should practically approach this flood control situation from the standpoint of what might be termed a long-run program, extending over a period of thirty to forty years. It would be highly desirable if our statesmen at Washington could be foresight ed enough to approach this situation not from a political viewpoint, but from an economic view - point, irrespective of party lines or party polls. . : It was my pleasure to talk the other day with one of the leading hydro-electric engineers who is just back from a two years' stay in the center of Mexico, studying engineering problems there for great cor - porations in the. east. This gentleman expressed the idea that what is needed in the flood control situation is a preliminary period of study, not only from the standpoint of engineers of his type, but a survey of the problem from the standpoint of the general economic situation one bit of which would be this problem of forestation, from that point of view. That is the reason I think every state in the Union — parti - cularly in the northern ps rt of the Mississippi valley — should have not now, but should have had in years past, a definite forestation problem. We are going to have to develop a belief that is wider than our own back yard — wider even than our own state — in these days when we. live so close together, and our economic and social welfare is so . dependent upon the other! fellow four thousand miles away. As I see it, we need a general reforestation program for the whole United States. I have seen conflicting statistics put out by organizations of - people interested in this. It seems possible to prove almost any sort of . statement by statistics, with no way of arriving at the absolute truth. Nebraska is part of the great Mississippi valley basin, as you know. In Nebraska we have in years past paid a good deal of atten- </seg>
            <seg id="p542">{KroRT uF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion to the planting of trees, as a state. Years ago we had tree claims in Nebraska. I think it was conceded to have been more or less of a failure; yet when we travel around we can see many places where the state has benefited greatly from those trees planted twenty - five years ago, which we have left to take care, of themselves from that day to this. That illustrates that the flood-control program should be studied not from what we will do this year, but what we will do for the next thirty years. You know Nebraska led in the matter of establishing Arbor Day in 1895. That distinguished citizen, the Honorable J. Sterling Morton, was the founder of a Tree Planting day. It is hard to say what was in the mind of Mr. Morton. Undoubtedly these things and many more of like nature were in his mind at that time. Nebraska used to be called "The Tree-Planting State." I talked to a gentleman who said, "It is a desert-looking state for a man to discuss a fbresta - tion program." A few years ago we were supposed to be a part of the "Great American Desert," but people are giving up that idea. There are people in the western part of the state who have worked the problems out there and proven that the western part of Nebraska is of quite as much value as any other part of the State, or any neigh - boring state. My mind runs back to years ago when I was a student of the classics, and I remember in the time of the ancients the old temples were groves of trees. Somehow in the human heart from time im - memorial has come down the idea the tree is a sacred or devotional thing. Groups of trees were commonly the churches where individuals met to worship. Personally, and I know I ■ am speaking the senti - ments of most of you here, I love trees. Sometimes when I drive up and down the roads of Nebraska and find our road department slaughtering beautiful trees, I wonder whether they are. in harmony with the best interests of the country? I suppose that representatives would like to have somebody raise the question as to whether we .should denude all the roads of trees. Rows of trees detract from the fertility of the soil within an area of several feet. But they tell us the government has demon - strated that you can reforest or produce a forest in forty years; and the lumber firms are demonstrating it pays financially to take land suitable to forest trees and plant that land to trees, and not to expect an income from it for forty years. At the end of that period they can repay enough in the way of timber purposes to pay them as a commercial investment, including interest on the investment, etc. " </seg>
            <seg id="p543">NEBRASKA STATE. HORTICULTURE SOCIETY "We •will not advocate that all this fine farm land should be plant - ed to trees, but we do have large areas of land suitable to some kinds of pine trees. The government has demonstrated that pine trees can - be successfully raised in certain parts of the sand hills. We have by nature vast areas of land that could profitably, either as a state enterprise or a private enterprise, be set apart for foresta - tion. That is one angle of the program. There is no doubt each far - mer could set apart, by judicious selection of trees, a portion of his farm for this purpose. Many trees have been planted without scien - tific knowledge as to the kind of trees to be planted; but there is no doubt it would be well to encourage general planting of trees around farmsteads and homes. I spent this last summer in northern Minnesota, with my family. We have forty acres of ground. There is enough granite there to build forty capitols like ours. It is covered with varieties of pine and birch and maple. My wife said, "We must take back one of those birch trees." We worked a whole day in the rocks and dug out a wagon load of rocks following the roots, and got two out. The growth . of the trees had temporarily been stopped by frost. We wrapped the roots up. Coming home, we struck that spell of hot weather. The trees had been taken from within twenty-five miles of the Canadian line. I said, "Those things can't possibly live. Let's throw them away." My wife and boy planted these trees and watered them. The nurseryman said they are both doing fine. We will be a happy family if those two beautiful birches, about six feet high, live in our back yard. The Canoe birch is not the type of tree that will thrive here. We brought down a mountain ash. I am told it should thrive here. We have one here and are going to play with it. Lots of us get pleasure out of working with those things; We brought down some evergreens and some are living. We are interested in them. There is something abcut a tree that seems almost human as it grows. In the schools we will attempt to do what little we can in creating an interest in. trees and in this program of reforestation. My object in accepting the kind invitation to talk to you people was to let you know that we as a Department of Education believe in re - forpstatinn and in the conservation, of forests and of the trees we have and in the conservation of our wild life — our fish and birds and wild animals. We believe human beings who are developed as they should be will have at least some interest in such things as trees and the wild things of nature. Nebraska is a wonderful ' state.

OF AGRICULTURE us a variation in rainfall and climate that makes it possible for us to have a delightful combination of those things in our own state, as compared with other states like Iowa and Kansas. I do not know what this Society may be able to do towards a program of reforestation. I have no program. I am ignorant as to how it should be started. But I am convinced in my own mind, as a state we should do something to encourage the planting of more trees and taking care of them, and the dissemination of knowledge of how to raise them; because in forty years you can raise a tree that will be useful for commercial purposes if we have no sentimental feeling for trees. I have noticed the difference between Canada and the United States. In northern Minnesota and Wisconsin you can travel hundreds of miles in forest wastes where the lumber companies have taken out the cream of the trees from the standpoint of lumber. They have not cleaned up after their own work nor planted for the new crop. Of course that is natural. The problem is in fifty years there won't be any more trees than now, in a country ideally situated for the growth of trees. In Canada, the Canadian government gives to a lumber com - pany the right to cut the trees, but they put on inspectors to see that the company lives up to the cutting contract. When they have cut over the timber, the Canadian government insists that trees be re - planted and the ground cleared up. You can find hundreds of thou - sands of acres of that Canadian forest country where the young trees are coming back. It is with a little feeling of regret I have noticed the difference between the attention our government gives to the matter as compared to the attention given the same problem across the line. Last year our Department co-operated with the Izaak Walton League in putting on an essay-writing contest. We are ready to do that again, and to co-operate with any state organization that wants to do something to stir up more interest and enthusiasm in the mat - ter of reforestation. I thank you.

            <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA STATE IIOKTICULTUUE SOCIETY "GARDEN CLUBS" ■ Mrs. George W. Hart, Omaha, Nebraska Bill Shakespeare, the bard of Avon stream, once said in days gone by, that many a blushing rose was born unseen to live and die. His flowers were of the borders and of the modest setting of cool green woods. The Garden Clubs have changed all this. True, every live garden club has its pilgrimages, as was undertaken, to apple-blos - som land last year, but real acquaintance with our flowers has its greatest fulfillment at the shows. The winter shows by the numerous glass-house florists, chrysanthemums, carnations, and roses, are in a class by themselves. The outdoor growers \* ait until spring, and then in gay suc - cession come displays of iris, peonies, roses, and gladiolias in wonder - ful array, each flanked by other seasonal blooms. It is not enough to grow flowers with a moderate degree of suc - cess, but to know how to cut and arrange them in pleasing combina - tions for indoor delight is an accomplishment. It is at the shows that we find the new varieties with their proper botanical names. The novice sometimes complains about this nomen - clature, saying it is easier to remember the common names; but - botanical Latin is the Esperanto of the garden, the so-called common names changing with every locality. An interesting fact comes to light in this respect. A group of English students found thirty - seven different names for ihe viola, or pansy, in as many different shires. For the digitalis; or foxglove, the tally was seventy-one. About three years ago the Sass iris hybrids began to be seen on the show tables, their wonderful new plicates lined and dotted with fawn and lilac, or sprinkled and sanded with, peach and fawn, all heavily bordered, heavy textured, and large flowered. Hans Sass' first named peony, Florence McBeth, had .its premier at the Des Moines show of the National Peony Society that year, receiving the first-class certificate. New honors of bronze medals and certificates have since come to the Sass brothers, and last spring the silver medal of the Iris Society was awarded their wonderful display at the show in Omaha. We are indeed fortunate that their gardens are so near and accessible. The exhibitor finds a helpful spirit prevading the show room. Containers, water, and helpers are ready to aid in getting the displays ready for the exhibition tables. The collections, groups, and named single specimens must all be distinctly labeled and placed in respective positions. </seg>

Have plenty of extras to offset this condition, if you can. It is essential to the judges that count be correct, neither more nor less than speci - fied; and remember the blossoms are judged as they see them, not as they appeared the night before or the day after; so sometimes what may seem to us as an unfair reward may be assigned to some such cause. But what a thrill after they have finished, to see the blue ribbons dot your entries, and the satisfaction of achievement with red and white tokens generously, and we hope justly, rewarded ! The juniors in groups, ages up to eight, and twelve to sixteen, are now able to compete in many of our exhibitions, there being special classes in floral display and arrangement to test their skill. Flower shows can teach conservation. At a recent national ex - hibit, a natural woodland scene, reproducing a bit of Nature's plant - ing, was arranged by the Garden Club of America. A contrast corner was a characteristic defilement of the holiday tripper, leaving ashes of a fire, empty cans, broken dishes. A label read: "God made the fields; God made the flowers; God made the moss-grown stump. A picnic party came along, And now we have a dump." (Laughter.) Our shows have improved our garden perspective. The beauti - ful rose, peony, or newly acquired iris has its price, though some - times it is hardly more than the cost of a box of candy or of a theatre ticket. One friend wondered how she could get slips to grow so she could give her friends plants of her wonderful rose bush. She was shocked when told: "Why bother? Why not have them buy plants? They cost only a dollar." For garden beauty money must be spent. And then, to quote our Eddie Guest: "The man who wants a garden fair, Or small, or very big, With flowers growing everywhere, Must bend his back and dig."

Last year they found it advisable to make two classes both for the original conception and the adaptation of famous pictures of flowers in their containers. They were surrounded by a frame and took their proper position in this frame. The frames had a box built at the back to hold the picture. The effect was a framed picture when looked at from the front, but the flowers were: .natural. The first time these llower pictures were shown, they experienced a little difficulty be - cause one contestant had pressed the flowers flat and used straw (lowers. It was not the idea of the Club to award on that basis, but to use fresh flowers, and some good effects were obtained. It seems to have struck a new note in Club decoration. There were a great many entries. In reading of the Peony Show in Peoria, I found that a special gallery of nearly one hundred framed flower pictures had been ar - ranged.

Usually the back - ground is a rather pretty piece of drapery or tapestry which blends in with the conception of the picture. MRS. M. T. WHITE, (Omaha) : Another interesting exhibit we have had at our Flower Shows was a number of miniature gardens. THE SECRETARY: It looks like it would take a lot of time to fix up those gardens. They are little reproduction^ of gardens, and everything is worked out with flowers. MRS. WHITE: It is really a miniature landscape. ; THE SECRETARY: I am sure we would be interested in it, but 1 was wondering whether we could get anybody to spend much time on such an exhibit. ;■■■■■; MRS HART: I think Ly are made 18 by 22 inches. A peach crate would hold the contents. They are not built on the floor of the exhibition hall, but displayed on tables. We make them up and bring them down. It is the originality shown in making little garden scenes ha counts. They try to ] get them to scale. They are just called miniature gardens." If yo^ , im j t thdr size&gt; th b possible but 18 to 22 inches is the maximum. Some exhibitors intro - duce water in them. t Jtw ? E&lt; ? ETARY: D ° y° u know how much it would take t"o"at - tiact that kind of exhibits? The prizes for our best table decorations Xa'r^rsT 0 &gt;V0UMthat be h * h "^ * MRS. HART: I think that would be high enough. THE SECRETARY: wUd it be better to have ribbons or money?. MRS. HART; Ribbons, and if there is any 'money coming to us, we would look for it also. THE SECRETARY: That's just like a woman! We have not given anything but cards in the past, and they are not valuable. Some people would prefer ribbons to money. They say money is soon gone, but if you have a nice ribton, you can use it to advantage in your trophy rooms. ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A VOICE: It might be advisable to call them "Amateur Flower Gardens," because we might get professional gardeners and florists in - terested in them. MRS. WHITE: This might be made a water garden— a pool— or a rock garden. THE SECRETARY: That would be included in the flower garden. MRS. WHITE : We have had several little pools with the plantings around them that were pretty. THE SECRETARY: I think water adds considerably to the ap - pearance of the garden. It would not exclude them from entering. MRS. WHITE: What would be the date of this exhibit? If on Labor Day, it would enable all of us to come. THE SECRETARY: Labor Day is the opening day. I think they should be judged the morning of the following day. It will be difficult to hold those exhibits up until the end of the week. We can not possibly hold flowers a week if we have hot weather. We will insist we do not have those exhibits in place until Monday, be - cause that is the time most people can get away. Getting ready for some of these flower exhibits is no small job. I think we shall insist they be entered Monday and judged Tuesday morning. We can not judge the same day. MRS. WHITE: Usually with flowers you have to do that because they do not hold up long enough. We generally ask them to have their exhibits in place by a certain hour and have them judged im - mediately. THE SECRETARY: That will be quite a job if they do not work faster than last year. It took them all day. If we have many classes, we will get into difficulty. We may have to have two or three series of judges. MRS. WHITE: We had a set who judged the miniature gardens and the art pictures, and another set for the other gardens. That helps out. MRS. HART: Couldn't they be classed under one set as a matter of arrangement, and have another set of judges to judge the quality of the blooms themselves? THE SECRETARY: That is not a matter we have to specify in I our premium list. We can make the needed arrangements next fall. THE PRESIDENT: Mrs. Mills, of Omaha, will also address us on the topic of "Gardens." </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE HOKTIC UtiTURE SOCIRTY "GARDENS" Mrs. J. F. Mills, Omaha, Nebraska When I was asked to speak here I understood it was to be a round-table discussion of our Gardenj Club work; so I wrote Mrs. Francis King and asked her for a message to add to the round table. She writes as follows: • "■ • • The Valencia, St. Augustine, Florida • ' &gt; December, 27, 1927. My dear Mrs. Mills: • So beguiling is your letter oi! the 19th that I can not help .. answering it at once and rather at length. But before replying to your suggestions, I must say that I am sending you a box of seeds from last summer to' give to any at your Round Table who may special - ly like to have them. I have so many this year — We had a wonderful season for ripening seed — that I am only too glad to share them. The . delphinium seed is very remarkable and little known in this country — a perennial. Of course, show the little 1 garden picture — I enclose one or two more, too. And I shall put in a list of my books here, since you are so good as to say that you wish to make them known. A most delightful member of the Little Garden Series will appenr in early spring: "Spring in the Little Garden", by Miss Frances Mcllvane of Philadelphia. I consider it one of the most charming and valuable little works on gardening eyer done in this country. The first word I would send to your Clubs is the value of some study of design, of pattern,! in the small garden. A Club, might well secure 'a copy of the large] book, "An Introduction to the Study &lt;rf Landscape Design," by Hubbard and jKimball, which, in spite of its formidable title, is really a popular book and would well repay study, taking it up at meetings, chapter by chapter. Fletcher Steple's "De - ngn in the Little Garden" is.another book which would help enormously in this way. Of course the main reason for more or less design in the small garden is that thus the best use of every inch of space is to be had ; and as soon as ground is really well used, it becomes beautiful. It must. "All's fair that's fit," as Charles Eliot's motto has it. One thing in your letter strikes me a little odd. Why do you make rock gardens in a rockless country? Why kick against the pricks? Why have the type of garden thai means extra labor, cost, and so on, to get, when there must -be a type really suited to your locality? In New Hampshire or Vermont, rock gardens? Yes, by all means. How difficult to have anything else there. But although I don't know Omaha and the surrounding country, my impression is that the latter is fairly level; that the soil is very fine; that a garden on the level or slightly ter - raced is the' simplest and best form for your region. I-^know that rock gardens are beir g urged now all over the coun - try, especially since the visit of that wonderful man, M. Henri Cpr - revon, to this country last jyear; but how impossible to make Alpine gardens with any success in the mor4 level states bordering on the , ■ Mississippi J Again, "All's fair that's fit." But perhaps I am beginning to preach. I do not mean to do that, as you know. I am so interested in the Clubs you have, and in </seg>
            <seg id="p552">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the work they are doing. In this day when roads are filled with ma - chinery and smells of oil and gas, people will begin to tire of contin - ual going. They will turn back upon their own houses, their own land, for relief from the boredom that a standardized recreation must always bring. They will begin to garden as never before. Your clubs will show them the way; and the more who learn through you the better will it be both for others and yourselves, and the richer will your own gardens become to yourselves for having been generous with them. Thank you for the word about the poppy seed. I feel as though I— even I — had made a little pool in Omaha through you, with small pink ripples, spreading, spreading. With all good wishes for your meeting, and the hope that this line or two may not in any way offend, believe me Very sincerely yours, LOUISA KING. The list of her books which I requested her to send is as follows: Published by Charles Scribners Sons — "The Well-Considered Garden" "Pages from a Garden Note Book" "Chronicles of the Garden" "The Beginner's Garden" Atlantic Monthly Press and Little Brown &amp; Co. "The Little Garden" "Variety in the Little Garden" Frederick A. Stokes &amp; Co. "The Flower Garden Day by Day". The pink poppy seeds she is sending unfortunately had not come when I left home. She spoke of putting them with Baby's Breath. If you care to have me do so, I will send them to the Lincoln Club so that you may have an opportunity to have some. It isn't good form to open a talk with an apology, so I am going to state facts. I am not an authority on garden pools. I am not an authority on rock gardens. But if I can cite a few paragraphs that I have read which perhaps you haven't, and afterwards you tell of some you have read which I haven't, together with any experience we may have had along these lines— well, maybe we'll have some good pools and rock gardens. Water has always taken its part in our scheme of garden delight, since the first garden was created. A further incitement to the use of water has been provided by the many forms and colors of water lilies now so easily to be had. Even the smallest back-yard garden is made more attractive by a pool, however tiny, or water in some form or another. The least thread of running water can be turned into a narrow stone-bordered rill that can be easily stepped over, with tiny pools at intervals. If this can be connected with a rock garden, so much the better. </seg>
            <seg id="p553">NEBRASKA • STATE. HOUTICULTIJRE SOCIETY A matter of some importance that is too often over-looked is that the water in pools should be kept at the right level, and that level should be as high as may bewith regard to a practical overflow. Nothing - looks more neglected than a half empty pool. We have so many good looking pools in Omaha, but I should like to tell you about one made by Ford Bates of the Nebraska Power Com - pany, at his home. .He has used flat pieces of limestone set in cement flush with the lawn, and no planting around the edges — a perfect jewel in the center of a half sunken garden. His yard sloped down to the house in the rear. He has dug out the space for his pool, leaving a terrace flanked with a perennial border, of about four feet at the back, graduating to nothing at the house. One feature of his pool he claims so satisfactory is that on each end he has partitioned off a space with a narrow wall of cement in which he places the soil for' his lilies, leaving the center free for his fish, thus doing away with the handling of unsightly tubs or boxes \ for the lilies. In this picture the pool is part of the flower garden at the side and back, and is correctly edged with flowering plants. Most pools are made for water lilies, but sometimes in formal gardens, pools are placed where the whole effect gains much by great trees in the background and their reflection in the -water. Here is a pool entirely different from the others. What a de - lightful surprise to come upon this lovely bit of water in our walk around the garden! It is always the unexpected which gives us the greatest thrill. Perhaps rock gardening is only a fad, but some of us will build rock gardens; so let us make them well. ■ To do a thing well, we must try to understand a few of the fundamentals. In the making of a rock garden, almost more than in any other kind of flower work, success depends upon certain basic, structural points. It is not just a case of tumbling a few big stones together, hit or miss, and sticking plants in the cracks. If you are going to make anything really last - ing and lovely, you must start to build it well below the surface of the ground. If it is not fundamentally right down in the hidden regions where the life of its plant inhabitants is really centered, it ■ can hot be expected to fulfill its role as a bit of luxuriant mountain . scenery on .a tiny scale. i . ■ . - . ■ - . To support a majority of desirable Alpine plants, the r6ck garden must be well drained, and yet provide a deep run where the soil will remain fairly cool and damp in summer. One of the best ways of as - suring this is to set in large flattish rocks so that only their tips </seg>

Xow, that is heart-breaking news when rocks an- so few and far between, isn't it? These should be placed in ll slantin.sr position in order to catch the rainfall and carry it under - ground rather than turn it away. If you plan to grow a fair variety of rock plants, it will be neces- • sary to vary the soil in different sections of the garden. Certain pockets should be acid; others, neutral; still others, alkaline. In "House and Garden" magazine for 1927, Louise Beebe Wilder writes some very interesting articles on "Flowers for the Rock Gar- ' . den," taking a different color each month, and giving long lists at the end of the article describing the plants in full and their likes and dislikes as to soil conditions. I am sure we will find these lists very helpful when selecting our rock garden plants. Where the construction is bold and extensive, fairly large subjects may be used, but, generally speaking, the ends of beauty are best served when the plants chosen do not exceed a height of one foot, nor the shrubs more than three feet, when full grown. Within these limitations is a wide choice, and some are fit and some are not fit foi the purposes of a rock garden. Planting in rough stone steps and walks should never interfere with the use of either and should be mainly restricted to the edges, so as to give the impression that the plants had sprung from seed scattered by those growing near, rather than having been deliberately planted. Any local stone is good for dry walling, and it is better than brick because the irregularity of the pieces provides larger openings for the plants; but brick with earth joints can also be used with suc - cess. It is not by any means small plants only that are fit for dry - walling, for mulleins, foxgloves and columbines are among the best, especially if they are grown directly from seed in the joints, and many bushy and half-bushy plants succeed admirably. A high, dry wall planted with lupine and irises with pinks at the foot make a pretty picture. Perhaps the ideal rock garden site is the hillside slope— one whose fall can be broken by paths and level spaces. Dry stone steps are laid on a cinder loam foundation having soil pockets in the face of the risers. If any of you would care to visit some rock gardens and pools while in Omaha, I have the addresses of several that are very attrac - tive; and you know true gardeners are always eager to show their gardens to all who are interested. </seg>
            <seg id="p555">XKUUASKA STA'.'E HOKTICULTUUE SOCIETY Some one has said a picture is worth a thousand words, so I am going to pass around a few pictures of rock gardens and pools, and ask some of you to tell of your experiences. . • . ' Discussion MRS. WHITE: We have rocks in our country and in our locality. A rock garden is like a painting. If jwe can not have an original, is that any reason why we should have no pictures on our walls? We can get the stones we have and put them in our gardens in a way I think is attractive. I am sure certain varieties of plants thrive upon our rocks — maybe not the true Alpine plants, unless we are better acquainted with, their nature and .how to care for them. All rocks are moisture-absorbing. Their will nourish plants, in a way, and pro - tect the roots from the heat of the sun . One authority says we should never have a miniature mountain. I am inclined to take issue with him. If we want a mountain and . if it would add to our happ ness and i npro've our landscape, I think it is all right to have one, provided we can blend it into its proper .••': setting and create the illusiojn. It is hard to procure thi; rocks, but they are plentiful if we will take the trouble to get them. It takes time and labor, but if we want a rock garden we can have it As for me, I want one and I am going to have one. THE PRESIDENT: The next on the program will be Mr. Frank . B.

            <seg id="p556">IKl'ORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I am glad of the opportunity to tell you briefly something about the work we are doing in this state. We of course are primarily interested in the conservation of our game and fish. But we are de - veloping a new line which it seems to me is tremendously important to the welfare of the state and its people, and that is in the line of recreation. As the country is becoming settled and Nebraska is rapid - ly acquiring good roads and modern transportation, the outdoor re - creation problem becomes more acute. It is more difficult for people to find places to camp and fish and hunt without encroaching on pri - vate property. We are trying to get hold of this problem and develop public grounds where people may spend a fortnight or a week end trip and not be in a place where they will be thrown out — not get on private property — and to make it a place which they can enjoy and get something of the wild life and the beauties of Nebraska. With this in mind, we are purchasing holdings throughout the state. We have secured four — one in southern Hall county; another in Sheridan county at Hay Springs; a holding in Cherry county on a large and beautiful lake, and the last one at Fremont — 165 acres of abandoned sand pits. Of course these properties are in the rough. They were cheap land. We felt by securing this cheap land and developing it, it will not only be good for people for recreational purposes, but it will beau - tify Nebraska and make it a nicer place in which to live. There is great opportunity in the abandoned sand pits. We find them along the Platte and other rivers. They are eyesores to the com - munity. The water in these pits is good for fish. They are deep and have speed which keeps fish from freezing in winter time .and gives the fish fresh water in summer. By grading and landscaping and planting of trees, these places can be made into nice recreational grounds. We have started at Fremont. It is a big job. It will take five years before we can make much of a showing. We believe we will do something worth while for the people, and you people who arc interested in this particular thing and have technical knowledge can help us with your ideas and suggestions along this line. We will be glad at any time to hear from you. We have started in on landscaping at Goose Lake and Hay Springs. We planted three thou - sand trees, and will plant some at Fremont this spring on the part we have prepared. Providing recreation for people is becoming very important. There is so much artificial entertainment and recreation today, it is a big thing to get the children and the older people away from the artificial, to study life in the open country where they can come in contact with Nature. When a boy goes into the open places, it broadens him and makes him a better citizen. I think one of the </seg>

When twilight comes, there is no one for miles and your children get a new idea o^ what a great thing Nature is and the majesty of it all. I think by developing these places we are going to do a wonderful thing for coming generations and some - thing for the state that will make it a place of beauty. Discussion , . ■ • THE PRESIDENT: I should like to ask what varieties of various trees you are using in this reforestation? A. We are trying to maki them natural to the state rather than artificial, so we are, using the commoner varieties of trees found here. Q. Are you planting some bait near by? (Laughter.) A. Thats' a good suggestion. Q. I should like to ask whether your department is attempting to co-operate with our state paries? We have three large tracts known as state parks— one at Arbor Lodge; one in Custer county, and one at Grand Island. It occurs to me in connection with his idea, that it would.be well if you could co operate with the state parks by adding fish and game to those parks ahd make the two -work together They could help you and you could help them. It might be under one board of control, for that muter. That! is just a suggestion. They are so related that they should be co-operative. Are you doing anything about stocking up these state parks? A. Yes,, we are. The po nt is well taken. The work is similar, and we have done some work and expeci to do more. We have co - operated with Chadron, and ar£ putting in now a fish pond at Victoria Park in Custer county, cutting off the olji creek bed, putting through a ditch, and making possible, not only fishing but boating at those particular places. There is one thing we must bear in mind. Our Fish and Game , department is self-sustained, practically, by the fishermen and hunt - ers. We collect $150,000 a y^ear from licenses and fines from those who hunt and. fish, i The Park Board under a commission is supported by funds. We use |no tax money because we have sufficient funds to operate from the license morey. We feel the major part of this money should go for the purpose for which it is paid— the promotion of hunting and fishing. However, I believe that the hunter and fisher •would not object to a considerable sum I being spent in the develop - ment of state parks. I think if the legislature should see fit to do that, there would be little objection, and it would dovetail the two and enable us to help them, and they in to help us. </seg>
            <seg id="p558">Kl'oliT UK NKIIKASK.V STATK BOARD OK AGRICULTURE y. Is there any way possible to get rid of the cavp out of the pits? A. It is a hard problem to handle. There is very little that can be done in the sand pits. It is a difficult feature. It is hard to eradi - cate the carp. We can reduce their numbers, but can not eradicate them altogether. In places not so deep, we can get them out by sein - ing. By the use of lime we can eradicate all fish life, but that kills i .•■ trame fish as well. It is difficult to separate the sheep from the goats. THE PRESIDENT: What variety of fish seems to be the best in these sand pits? A. Black bass do well, and so does the croppy. Practically all the fish we are propagating will do well, with the exception of trout, . which need fast-running water, as found in the western part of the state. The perch and bullhead and catfish do well, but the catfish will not propagate in the sand pits. It requires constantly running water. The bass, which we are producing in large numbers as a game fish, and the perch and croppy, and bullhead for the children and those who prefer a fish easier to catch, are all being used. Have you tried the pike? A. Not very much. There is considerable pike in this state of certain varieties. Last year we had a million eggs, and hope to catch two million this spring. It is a matter of experimentation. Q. Would lake trout be feasible? A. Mr. O'Brien says they tried them out eight years ago and never had success with them. Q. Will the walleyed trout live in the sand pits? A. We have some of them at Lake Quinnebaugh, near Tekamah. Last summer I saw fifteen nice pike in the sand pit at Fremont. We hope to be able to bring them back not only in artificial bodies of water, but in the rivers as well. Q. How long hefore you can do fishing at Fremont? A. There are several lakes open for fishing. Last year's catch on bass was good. We are starting something new. We have had some lakes in the sand hills overstocked with bullheads — so many they are stunted and do not do well. We are developing a large truck to run on the highways similar to our fish car. The boys call it "The Bullhead Special." We will bring the bullheads from the sand hills where we can get them and stock these places with bullheads for chil - dren. We are going to dump the big fellows into one of those lakes at Fremont by the truck load. </seg>
            <seg id="p559">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Q. If a party has a sand pit of his own and stocks it himself, must he have a license? A. Yes, for. Nebraska fish- on private property. The man who owns it can control the fishing on it. jWe stock many private places, but make a charge. If it is understood it is open to the public, we will stock it free. If for private use, they must pay for the fish. Q. How long does it require to grow a fish until it is large enough to catch? A. From two to ten yetrs. Some catfish are forty years old. Q. How about the alkali lakes? A. The only solution for an alkali lake is fresh water. At Hay Springs this lake is alkali. You remember the "monster"? That is the lake that drew the unfavorable publicity. We have diverted Hay Springs creek into the lake and run ip through. The abundance of fresh water has reduced the alkali to the extent that the fish are doing splendidly. There are thousands of fish in there now. If it is a large lake and we can not get fresh water, it is impossible to propagate the fish. We have a lake in Scofrts Bluffs county which may interest you. That is where we get our gold fish. These gold fish are nothing more nor less than the carp with his. Sunday clothes on. They have the same destructive habits thej carp has. They grow large. The flat tails we import. Some of them are beautifully colored and make fine fish for public parks in the larger pools. They are not a success for the smaller pools. Q. Are there any of those spring creeks in the Platte valley with trout, or will trout live in i;hem? A. If you have enough spring water. It is a matter of temper - ature and moving water. If the spring is adequately maintained and the temperature net too high, it will be all right if you keep away from flood water. - . Q. Did you look at Barnum creek south of Columbus on the Y. M. C. A. boy's camp ground? Would trout do up there? A. They might. Q. It is cold to wade th ire. A. There is another interesting thing in regard to trout. There are private hatcheries starting up. The boys at Beaver Crossing are raising trout successfully. We figure about sixty-five streams have good trout fishing. If the fish are raised to several inches long and </seg>
            <seg id="p560">IKPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE released in natural water, 50 per cent reach maturity. When raised under the old system, only 5 per cent reach maturity. Q. They dredge that water out so that it is warm enough to enjoy swimming. A. We will be glad to send a fish culturist up and make an in - vestigation and take the temperature any time they wish. Q. I had experience with fish. We "had a flood. I was acting on a plan of my own. There is an artesian spring there. I was going to put a lot of bass where there was no carp and start food for them. I Then replenish the lake and get away with the carp. My idea is to have the bass feed on the carp, and get so many bass they will hold J the carp back. A. You have the right idea. It is the same as any thing else in nature. It is balance of power. In one lake this year we have a tremendous hatch of bass which wiil overcome everything else be - cause of numbers. One variety makes a big hatch and holds the bal - ance until another big hatch comes along. Your idea fundamentally ' is right for the propagation of them. Q. 1 caught one bass 23'ji inches Jong that weighed seven pounds. I caught one later 27 inches long. I put it on ice. This was Thurs - day morning. Monday morning it weighed only seven and one-half pounds. You can take a five-pound bass fish out of the lake, and in four hours it will shrink half a pound. THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Field is not going to be with us to . di«cu*s "The Perennial Border," but perhaps we can have a discussion on IVivnnials. THE SKCRETARY: Perhaps we might start a Round Table on l'&lt; P v.iials, beginning with some of the various individuals from dif- - fon-nt parts of the state. Mr. McComb is an old horticulturist and ■ perhaps could give us suggestions as to what does well in the North Pl.itto section. There are frequently questions asked of us here in the Department as to the types of ornamentals that do well out here. PERENNIALS MR. McCOMB: At North Platte we have an idea every home ought to have some kind of a flower or a shrub around it. We have been trying a lot of different perennials. There are two I want to mention which will grow anywhere in the state — the peony and the iris. Peonies in favorable years are marvelous there. They should be planted with a little windbreak in the direction where the winds do most damage. We have had thirty-six varieties and most of them are doing wfll. </seg>
            <seg id="p561">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY The iris will grow anywhere in the state and it is very beautiful. Our collection is not large. We have around fifteen varieties- -nearly all good. I presume you are familiar with those. As I see it, 1 think no place ' should be ' without those two perennials anywhere in the state. I believe we can make that statement hold. We have beautiful perennial popj ies. They are difficult to trans - plant'and you will have difficulty in 1 getting a 100 per cent stand, but you can absolutely gel good results. It is not the nurseryman's fault, nor yours, but the nature of (the -poppies which makes them difficult to transplant. You will have some loss unless you arc care - ful. I usually get 90. per cent to stand. At North Platte we sow seed frequently to keep up the stand and enlarge it. Another thing I think a good deal of is the tiger lily and other lilies. Our lilies stand high and bloom clear down. We have some good yucca. They bloomed the first time this year. One stalk was seven feet tallJ They lose a little of the color of the leaves and droop, but I have not had any winter killing. The kind we have may be a little tender for some parts. There is an - other yucca which is hardy. For some of the people that would be an ideal plant to use. The gallardia is attractive. I see no reason why some of it could not be grown. '. One of the prettiest things this year was a bunch of columbine. They do remarkably well on the north side of a growth of shrubbery giving them winter protection. They will ..self seed. I am able to keep up a patch and enlarge . it from ordinary self -seeding. If trans - planted, they will grow in certain places if properly located. These things I have named will grow if just given ordinary rough care without much attention to winter protection. When we want to winter protect and give a little irrigation, we can extend our list about as far as we want without getting into the pure southern stuff. I think we can grow practically everything you can grow in the eastern part, if you will give winter protection. Lots of things will stand the cold if they don't thaw and freeze too frequently. We have such heavy snow fall, some of ihe perennials are apt to have that happen .to them. I thank you for this opportunity, DUcuMion Q. Will columbines grow on the north? A. Yes, if given shade. </seg>

I have had best results with them. Q. You would not plant in July? A. I never tried it except with one plant. That one grew. THE SECRETARY: There is a lot of inquiry about the yellowing of plants. What do you suggest as a remedy for that condition? A. That is quite common in western sections on both irrigated and dry land. Some of the yellowing is due to alkali conditions. That is not the big problem. It is where we do not have alkali. I find we do not know anything about it or what is the cause. There has been a general theory it is due to lack of iron. I am satisfied that probably is not the reason entirely. I have put iron around plants in soluble condition, and it did not bring the desired results. It may be the lack of iron in some cases. I do not believe necessarily that is the cause out there. I have found in the spirea I can keep it down by heavy pruning; but do not think that is the final answer to the question. I had some fuchsias heavily yellowed and pruned them. It did not do away with the yellowing entirely, but they did not have that ugly appearance. In strawberry patches we put lime, arid sometimes it will answer. These suggestions indicate there may be more than one cause b;uk of it. The station has been sending out men for a few years, but I do not know of anything really definite that has been accom - plished. Q. Do you have yellowing in the eastern part of the state? A. Alkali will always produce it. It is more distinctly a western condition. THE SECRETARY: In many cases, spraying the leaves with fer - rous sulphate will help. A. The iron is more available in ferrous than in ferric sulphate. Lots of people use the ferric and do not get results. In some places iron would be the solution of the problem. Q. In connection with the yellowing of plants, of course that has been a serious problem especially with the pineapple in Florida and other places.

Watkins, Extension Forester The history of forestry in Nebraska would probably be a more interesting subject if earlier information were available. There is some very conclusive evidence that at one time a considerable portion - of the present plains area was covered with forest. It is certain that some fairly large trees existed in the western part of the state because logs and stumps are still being -dug out when excavating for build - ings, Etc. The present knowledge of forestry would make it seem that these largo trees would not be growing singly but were remnants of a one-time forest. Further we know that pine is native to north - west Nebraska and twenty-five years of planting pines on the Nebraska National Forest has proven that these trees grow successfully under existing climatic conditions. In spite of the fact that Nebraska is still considered by some as part of the Great American Desert, every county in the state can show some very fine artificially planted farm proves that were grown under natural conditions. To say what happened to Nebraska's timber would be only guess - work on my part but I can repeat some plausible theories advanced by men who knew the state in the early days. Fires evidently played an important part and in fact evidences in the way of fire scars are found on some of the buried logs. We also know that grazing was one of the first industries started in the state and severe grazing is very destructive to young timber. These two factors would certainly account for checking reproduction. Lack of reproduction and cutting mature timber for construction and fuel could not continue indefinitely without the apparent result. We know now that a farm woodlot or windbreak fenced into a pasture is doomed because the ground be - </seg>

NKIiltAKKA STATK lIOItTIC IJLiTUHK SOCIETY comes packed, the undergrowth is eateii or killed out and the trees gradually die from starvation, while if the ground is kept in cultiva - tion until the trees shade out the grass and weeds, the natural process is for the litter to! form a forest, floor bejfore the ground becomes pack - ed. Under these conditions trees will grow and I think this is an im - portant factor in the future success of farm forestry in Nebraska. Fires and unrestricted grazing would not permit this condition to exUt and could undoubtedly be held responsible for at least some forest destruction. I would like to mention some evidence which to me bears out some of these early theories of drastic changes in conditions altho it is somewhat aside from forestry. The Dismal river valley of western Nebraska, familiar I am sure to most of you, was known in the early days as the best elk hunting, ground in the world. In using the term "early days" here I mean about sixty yoars ago. Thepoint 1 want to make is that if it was possible to exterminate thousands of head of elk in comparatively few years, would it not have been possible to use and destroy thousands of acres of forest? This is all more or less problematical so far as most of us are concerned, but we do know that a greai change has been made in the state by tree planting during the past fifty years. "While we consider eastern Xebraska fairly well planted to trees now, those of you who - knew the state fifty years .ago realize that the. native timber at that time was confined to fringes along streams and during this period it has extended up stream, in some cases, several miles. To be sure if we had depended on natural regeneration for trees here we would .still be living on the windswept plains, tree planting was, and in fact still is, an important activity, so important that • Nebraska was given the name "Tree Planters State". One of the early forest laws affeiting Nebraska was a Timber Culture act introduced by a Nebraska Senator, and was intended to promote farm forestry in the prairie section. It required that trees be planted on ten acres of each quarter section before patent could be received. While this wad strictly a conservation measure and an ideal throty, the people comijig- here fnjm more humid sections found difficulty in keeping the trees alive until the patent was received, and in many cases this law was fraudulent y used as were many of tin - earlier forest laws. It is probably true] that little success in the tree planting resulted from the Timber Culture Act since title to the land was the goal rather than developing a home. More important than any laws was the desire for trees by the .real home builders who will always be figured in the history of Nebraska's development. There are innumerable interesting phases of fairly forestry development in Nebraska and the influence of some of the pioneer tree planters is </seg>

Sterling Morton, a lover of trees and the founder of Arbor Day, established a lasting forestry demonstration on the grounds of his home at Nebraska City, Another type of forestry development started with Dv. ttessey's program about thirty years ago when his knowledge and keen interest brought about [hi establishment of the Nebraska Xationa! Forest which now is a liv - ing memorial to his untiring efforts. This planted forest of some 1^.000 acres of pine is a demonstration of what trees will do in the mUiill section of the state. The experience gained by this project ' i.- worth ;i great deal to present day tree planters. The U. S. Forest Stivio operates an evergreen nursery in connection with the forest uln-ii stock is grown for their annual planting program of 1000 acres. Tin- &gt;urplus planting stock is distributed for planting windbreaks and woodlots on farms. The Nebraska State Horticultural Society has done a great deal toward guiding the forestry development of the state, and the annual reports of this society present a very comprehensive outline of how the work has progressed. Some of the papers presented by members a vi- very pood evidence of the thought that has been given to forestry. , The next step in forestry development was the Kinkaid Law under which any farmer living in the sixth Congressional district could re - ceive a limited amount of tree planting stock from this Forest Service i Nursery. There were many thousand trees distributed under this law and some very fine plantings resulted, but the fact that the trees were ! free and no requirements as to care caused many of the plantings to l&gt;e neglected. I have inspected many of these Kinkaid plantings where final proof on the claim had been made, the buildings abandoned and range cattle taking care of the trees. The stalks of what had been four or five foot evergreens were evidence that the planting hed been successful, and given a fair chance the trees would have reached ma - turity. The Kinkaid law can be considered as only partially successful in ! p i-tting trees started on the farms. , The most recent forestry legislation was the Clarko-McNary law of M&gt;'2h which made funds available for forestry education and stock for farm planting in states willing to cooperate with the U. S. De - partment of Agriculture in the f arm forestry project. Nebraska took advantage of this in 192G and during the three year period following nearly a million forest tree seedlings have been distributed to 4000 far mers for planting windbreaks and woodlots. The Agricultural Extension Service has employed a forester for the purpose of teaching better methods of forestry practice in planting and care of trees, and gen - eral assistance in farm forestry. What success will result from this law is yet to be determined since the law is young. However, the interest being taken in tree planting and extra emphasis being placed </seg>

Let us boi.o that in the future as in the past we can have the hearty cooperation of all organizations interested in Nebraska's development. i- :■ ■■- ■•-•■■•■ . i- ' .■: : </seg>

WEBBER I have been asked to give a short talk this morning on the topic "Sheep Feeding Facts". This subject is very interesting to me and I hope it may prove equally as interesting to you. The letters coming to the Animal Husbandry office indicate that many Nebraska farmers keep fairly accurate records of their sheep feeding operations. Some of these records furnish valuable information relative to the feeding methods which may prove most profitable in the future. However, it is sometimes difficult to explain the low gains made by certain bunches of lambs. Occasionally an abnormal death loss occurs for no apparent reason. As a result we find that sheep feed - ers often arrive at radically different . conclusions because of the results which they get with different rations fed under varying con - ditions. Feeders Do Not All Agree On Best Rations Thousands of lambs are fed near Omaha each year upon corn and alfalfa molasses meal. Some feeders insist that the corn should be cracked; others say that cracking the corn is an unnecess - ary expense. A few prefer a 50% molasses mixture, but probably the majority favor 30% molasses. Nor are they agreed as to. whether beet or cane molasses is the lest. Differences of opinion also exist regarding the advisability of adding a protein supplement to the .ration. The kind of supplement to use under given price conditions varies according to the personal opinions of the operators. What arc the facts and how can they be obtained? It is obvious that some of these preferences are not based upon facts. . Corn and Alfalfa a Standard Ration ' ■ '■ ' * ■ -I I have the greatest respect for a well estabished practice that is used by the majority of farmers. However, a careful search for the facts of the matter may reveal that the practice is faulty or merely a tradition handed down from one generation of feeders to the next </seg>
            <seg id="p576">UKI'dKT OK NKIUIASKA STATIC l\n.\lU&gt; &lt;&gt;K Ai'.RU-J'hTt'KK For almost twenty-five years the Nebraska Experiment Station has been experimenting: with different feeds in an attempt to improve upon shelled corn and alfalfa hay for fattening lambs. I need but say that ' we are still trying out various combinations of feeds to prove that we have not been successful in finding a substitute that will give better results under all conditions. However, some progress has been made. We are all interested in the methods of feeding which will result in the greatest profit. But feed cost is not the only thing that determines profit. We must also consider margin of soiling price over purchase cost, gains, death losses, weight of feeder lambs, and kind of sheep, whether ewes, wethers or lambs. Feed Costs are Important J know of a double deck of lambs on feed at the present time that cost $13.00 per cwt. about 75 days ago. They averaged 63 pounds at Omaha. If all the lambs bought are marketed at 88 pounds and the gains cost UMjc per pound and the cost of marketing but not the cost of labor is figured in; then they must sell for $13.30 per cwt. to break even. Or if the gains cost 10% instead of 9V4c, they will have to bring $13.60 per cwt. in order to hold the money together. In other words, at the present prices for lambs and feed each increase of $1.00 per cwt. over $9.50 in the cost of a hundred pounds gain means that 30c must be added to the selling price per cwt. to absorb the additional feed cost. Or to state it still differently, an increase of $1.00 per cwt. in feed costs means decreasing the profit per Iamb 25c or what is more likely, increases the loss per lamb 25c. When feeder lambs and fat lambs are bringing about the same prices it is easy to see that the feed cost, other thincs being equal, helps determine profits and losses. Linseed Meal Often Improves Ration What is the cheapest and best ration to use at the present time? An average of 14 tests at this station shows that it will be profitable to add linsood meal to a shelled corn and alfalfa hay ration whenever 40 bushels of corn and one ton of alfalfa hay will buy one ton of linseed meal. That means that with corn at 70c a bushel attd alfalfa hay at Sir..uo a ton, one ton of linseed meal is worth $43.00 to feed the lambs. The addition of linseed meal makes it easier to keep the lambs on a luavy feed of urain and also results in slightly faster gains. Cotton - .-&gt;•&lt;■ .1 cake has proved practically equal to linseed meal when fed with shelled corn and alfalfa hay to lambs in two trials at this station. We are feeding 8 lots of lambs this winter on shelled corn and alfalfa hay together with linseed meal, cottonseed meal, and corn gluten meal fed separately and in various combinations, in an attempt to find a more I satisfactory supplement than either linseed meal or cottonseed meal. I i </seg>
            <seg id="p577">NEBRASKA IJUFKOVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATE Avoid Death Loss if Possible Substituting alfalfa molasses meal for alfalfa hay does not de - crease the cost of gains. Grinding J the alfalfa results in a con - siderable saving of roughage. Our experiments show that one ton of alfalfa meal is worth fully as much as 1 * 1 V* tons of alfalfa hay, and is - apparently worth, that much because of the hay wasted. There are times when money spent for sheep feed had better be spent for some other grain than corn. The relative value of such grains as barley, corn, oats, kafir, milo, etc., has been quite accurately de - termined by numerous feeding trials. I What effect will a 2% death loss have on the necessary selling Diice to break even on this double deck of lambs? If the lambs die when averaging about 75 pounds, it will mean that the lambs remaining must be marketed at 20c per cwt. pounds higher in order to absorb the loss. In other words, a 3% death loss and an increase of $1.00 in the cost of 100 pounds gain require about the same increase in selling price over what it would otherwise had to have been in order to break even. ■ ■ We have found, as an average of several trials, that lambs can be pushed harder on grain with a lower death loss where alfalfa molasse3 meal or alfalfa meal is fed than where alfalfa hay is fed. When a heavy ration of corn is not mixed with' roughage an excellent opportun - ity is afforded the greedy lamb to over-eat. If one desires to shorten the feeding period with less danger of i loss this is an apparently a good way to do it. However, shelled corn and alfalfa hay still make the best ration if the lambs are started on feed gradually and care is exercised to keep them from over-eating and going off feed. There is no question but that some death losses are hard to explain. We need more infor - mation on this problem. ■ ■ For the "benefit of those who have' just come in, I want to state that we feel that we are very fortunate in having a man with us today who have had a great deal of experience in sheep production in Illi - nois, a man who has a reputation for being practical, and who is probably conservative on the farm flock question. I take pleasure in introducing professor W. G. Kammlade of the University of Illinois. </seg>

KAMMLADE, University of Illinois Gentlemen: I am afraid when I get up here 1 will talk over some of your heads. I am glad to en me out from Illinois where it has been rather cool and enjoy some of your go:&gt;d Nebraska weather. I was in the Pnutry Department office this morning and I saw the sign on the box '"Nebraska Sunshine Eggs", but from what the poultryman told me I ilon't believe that it has been all sunshine that has produced these eggs here in the last few days. I am asked to talk on the Farm Flock. What, Where and Why, I believe are the three words that follow the farm flock. I suppose that some of you raised sheep. J suppose that some of you may want to raise sheep, and I suppose that some of you are like the old maid. This particular od maid hated men. Oh! how he hated them! She hated them so bad that she wouldn't even have a mail box around, and I sup - pose that is way some of you are about sheep. You hate them so you won't have them around, and to you I have nothing to say. I want to talk this afternoon, to those who first of all like sheep. Sheep raising as a farm enterprise continues because there are many people on our farms who like sheep and because sheep raising is profitable business. There are numerous qualifications that need to be added to the two reasons given if they are to be suitable to all con - ditions and there are many other influences which might ~be given in support of the farm flock; but I propose at this time to set up as two commanding motives in farm flock husbandry; first a liking for sheep, and second, a profitable financial inducement. My task then is to be the support of these statements and the offering and explanation of sug - gestions having to do with the handling of a farm flock so that it will give something to its owner in the way of happiness and money. What Farmers Should Have a Farm Flock During the last few years one of the most frequently asked ques - tir.ns regarding sheep has been: "Do you think I should keep sheep on my farm?" It is not always asked in just those words but the same idea is conveyed. In a great many cases this question has been answered by the statement that there should be a flock of sheep on every farm. This reply is not justified any more than a contradictory one to the effect that no sheep should be kept on any farm is justified. My opinion regarding the matter is that sheep are useful servants of </seg>

They contribute very important products that influence his well beinp, comfort and happiness and as such may be produced by those farmers who desire to use them as a part of a well balanced system of general farming. But that is not all, for while the head and heart of the farmer are considerations of major importance in farm flock establishment and management, other elements demand consideration Among these the fanner may include the number of .sheep to be kept, the type of farming followed, and the farm equipment available, kind and extent of o.thev livestock enterprises, the kind of crops grown and relative profitableness of sheep compared to other enterprises. It is no discredit to the sheep raising enterprise if fifteen or twenty brood sows return more profit than fifty ewes. The important consideration is: is the farm, as a whole, more profitable and does it make the farmer and his family happier to have the fifty ewes than would be the case without them? The Size of the Flock it Important The size of the flock is often not carefully considered. Let me say first that in talking about a farm' flock of sheep I do not have in mind four or five ewes. Such a number could hardly be considered a farm flock any more than one Jersey cow would constitute a dairy farm or one Hereford steer a beef producing establishment. In terms of animal units five to seven sheep are tVie usually accepted equivalent of one average sized cow. From the standpoint of commercial lamb production, therefore, on a farm of 160 or 240 acres, the ewe flock should contain at least 35 head. Fifty is a better number and about 100 is even better. This further explains why it is not advisable to advocate a flock of sheep on every farm. Some studies in the form of surveys are available to confirm the above statement.

Who can afford to buy the best ram, a man with seven or eight ewes or a man with five to ten times as many ewes? Just figure the relative sire charge on the lambs with a $50 or $75 ram in each case. Who stands the best chance of having good lambs at market time, the man |who has enough ewes to justify a vigorous, correctly made purebred ram that shows in his general appearance and minute detail of conformation that he carries with him the "duke's revenues" or the man who has so few ewes that he keeps </seg>

How Much Equipment is Needed Another question — Which man's flock is of enough significance in size to demand some attention at lambing time? At shearing time? Who is most apt to supply proper equipment? Who will have enough lambs and enough wool to warrant some care in pre - paration for market? Who will be in best position to fit sheep raising into a successful sy?t?m of farming? If you will think about these things you will come to the right conclusions about the size of the farm flock and will realize that perhaps after all one of the real reasons for the criticisms of farm flock husbandry in many sections of the cornbelt lies in the failure of many of us to appreciate some of the fundamental features of successful farm sheep raising. The equipment, farm buildings, fences, feed racks, etc., that are available on a farm bears directly on the problem of sheep raising. Few sections of this country demand elaborate equipment The farmer intending to keep a good sized flock is better able to supply suitable shelter. One of the most practical, least costly and healthful shelters for sheep is a structure that is open on the south. A shed that is located so as to have good drainage, that has a good roof to keep the quarters occupied by the sheep dry and at the same time offer protec - tion on the north, west and east exposures is not excelled as a sheep shelter. Each pregnant ewe of average size will require about 12-15 square feet of floor space exclusive of racks and partitions. Exposure to very strong, cold winds is a frequent cause of temporary blindness. Exposure to cold driving rains in late fall and winter is likely to lead to colds and stiffness. Troubles due primarily to exposure to extremely adverse conditions may be overcome to some extent by good feeding. However, healthfulness of the flock, good results at lambing time, par - ticularly in the case of early lambing, and good wool production by the ewe flock are most certain when shelter of the kind suggested is pro - vided. In the case of early lambing, special shelter in addition to the shed may be needed. Fences Should be of Woven Wire Fences for sheep are, of course, best when made of woven wire. When pastures are good the tightness of the wire and "fancy points" about fencing need give the sheep man little concern. This is why sheep may be so satisfactorily raised on temporary pastures.

Feed racks are constructed in a great variety of ways. My preference, for mature sheep, is a flat bottom rack with straight slat . sides arranged so that the sheep may jeat from both sides. These are easily built, easily moved, easily cleaned, economical to construct and are not wasteful of feed. Proper Feeds Should be Available The system of farming followed enters into any consideration of sheep husbandry. Is the farm producing crops ti.nt may be" used to maintain the flock in the best producing condition? Do these feeds contain the great variety of nutriment materials that nourish the animal body without any deficiencies' Of course, farm grown feeds may be supplemented by purchases but many times this is inconvenient and not the most economical practice. It is true, too, that sheep may live on waste feeds and feeds of very) poor quality and of low palata - bility, but successful flock husbandry ;is more than having a bunch of cues to eat weeds and gather, burs' in their He.v.-i &lt;. There is a si-eat difference in the attitude of a man who keeps sheep as scavengers of weeds and that of a man who keeps sheep because he likes them and because when given needed care theyj return a profit thru the sale of their lambs and wools. Sheep may be used to destroy many weeds if kept for the production of lambs and wool, but they cannot successfully produce lambs and wool if kept mainly to destroy weeds and forced to subsist on them and waste feeds entirely. There are basic nutritional requirements that must be supplied, after that weeds and waste feeds may be used for sheep feeds. The point I wish to make is this, that sheep should be considered as useful farm animals that produce profit when properly handled. A right attitude toward sheep is essential and will go a long way toward improving- farm sheep raisins'. Unrler these conditions then the system of farming* crop I rotation, etc., become im - portant in connection with sheep, production.

            <seg id="p582">KKl'uKT OK XKHHASKA ST.VTK IliiAKH OF AGRICULTURE earlier, the extra quality and condition of the lamb from the medium sized ewe are likely to off-set this and the maintenance charge of the smaller ewes is certain to be less. Ewes that are no longer suitable for range use are often very suitable as farm ewes. Such ewes, if sound in mouth and udder, even though lacking in conformation, when mated to good purebred rams are capable uf producing market topping lambs. In many sections of the world ewes no longer useful in one section move to another for a year or two after which they move to market and are replaced by a new selection. Such a practice may be justified in this country and is said by some to be more profitable than .the retention of ewe lambs as flock replacements. In such cases the greatest importance attaches to the ram. If the ewes are small the ram may be from one of the larger breeds or else be a large ram of one of the medium sized or smaller i breeds. Ewes Should be Flushed Before Breeding If the flock is established in the fall, the breeding season is first ' consideration. There are many practices that I have no time to dis - cuss and I wish to mention but one; that is flushing. This is commonly followed in some countries and represents a deliberate attempt by the owner to put his ewe flock in the most thrifty condition possible. It is generally accomplished by the feeding of grain, say about one-half pound per ewe daily, or by turning on to very good pasture — better than the ewes have had. Advantages claimed for flushing include earlier breeding and increased lambing percentage. That such is the case is indicated by figures from the United States Department of Agriculture's work at Beltsville, Maryland. Feeding the pregnant ewes during- the winter season is more important than many realize. At this time ewes are in need of many nutrients for they are maintaining their own bodies, producing a crop of wool and developing a lamb crop. In a general way their chief needs are for proteins, energy, minerals and vitamins. Wool contains mainly the elements that are found in protein; the dry matter of the developing foetus and of the ewe's body is likewise largely protein. That protein must be plentiful enough to meet these needs is evident. Energy for the body processes and for storage in the form of fat must not be overlooked. Minerals for skeletal growth and performance of vital functions must be supplied. Neither can success - ful sheep feeding be practical without the vitamins necessary for growth, for the deposition of minerals in the skeletal tissues and for^ reproduction. ! i j I ! </seg>
            <seg id="p583">NEBRASKA IMPROVED *IiJ.VKSTOCK HKEEDKRS' ASSOCIATE Legume Roughages Are Good Ewe Feeds Practical sheep men need not worry greatly about these rather technical considerations. It has been said that protein is necessary for sheep. ' Make a legume roughage such as alfalfa or clover the basis of the pregnant ewe's ration and this need is supplied. Here then is the way. it works; grow legumes in your crop rotation to follow good farming practice; feed legumes to your sheep to have a good basis . for your rations. Apparently there is no great danger from feeding only alfalfa, clover, soybean or sinjrilar hays as ewes have been so fed thruout the pregnancy period at the Illinois Station. A ewe that weighs 150 pounds will need about 2-3 pounds of legume roughage as a basis for her feeding. To this may be added straw, Btalks, pastures. • etc. Alfalfa and clover will not only supply the needed protein but will take care of minerals as well. If ewes are fed on mineral deficient roughages and grains, then mineral mixtures are needed; but in my opinion, it is better farming and better sheep raising also to put minerals on the soil if necessary in order to grow feeds that supply these not only to sheep but to other livestock as well. Alfalfa is also a good source of at least some of the vitamins. Furthermore, it may be that a lack of protein or minerals that leads to the trouble often referred to as before lambing paralysis in ' ewes. Constipation and auto-intoxication may be other causes. In •our experience ewes supplied abundantly with legume hays have not developed the trouble.. Three lots of ewes at the Illinois Station are now being used in an attempt to produce the desease by feeding. Two lots of them are not receiving any legume roughages nor any protein supplement in their rations. We may not be able to produce the disease but our observations leads us to think that it is a question ' • of feeding and management. Pregnant Ewes Need Some Grain Some grain is suggested for pregnant ewes under farm conditions. A half or three-quarters of a pound daily for the last month or two of pregnancy will enable the ewe to come to lambing with a reserve of . .fat and her body in good condition for the strain of the suckling period. A pregnant ewe may well weigh 30 or 35 pounds more at lambing than at breeding. The average loss at lambing will be 15 to 20 pounds, so the supply of fat under such conditions is not excessive. At one time the leading Shropshire breeders in this country was credited with a statement to the effect that ewes that are in proper condition at breeding time will not be too fat at lambing time. This was his way '■ of expressing the importance of good feeding in winter. i ■ .'■ . ' ; ■■ ■• '•■■ ■ ■ ■ ■-.■■■ </seg>
            <seg id="p584">UKJ'UHT of XKHKASKA STATK IM).\ltti OV A'UUCCLTrRK Silage may be used for ewes and is generally credited with a reduction of the cost of keep. Good silage fed to the extent of 3.5 to 4.5 pounds per ewe daily will not handicap ewes in any way. It cannot be considered as a good source of protein and is; therefore, best fed with legume roughages. Two and one-half pounds. of average silage is equivalent in food value to one pound of dry roughage. Therefore, if ewes are fed 3.5 pounds of legume hay alone and 2.5 pounds of silage is added, the legume roughness may be reduced to 2.5 pounds also. After lambing the ewe enters the period of the real drain on her system. If she is a good stickler she is certain to lose in weight when her lamb or lambs are everlastingly after milk. If lambing occurs boforw pastures are ready, grain feeding needs to be more liberal than during pregnancy. Two things insure a good milk flow-— a natural tendency to do so on the part of the ewe and an abundant supply of necessary materials — proteins, minerals, vitamins and energy. A pound of grain— oats and corn equal parts— and small amounts of bran and linseed meal together with legume roughages and silage supply these. Feed Young Lambs in a Creep Lamb feeding is frequently neglected. The little fellows like grain mixtures when about two weeks old — two parts of ground oats, 2 of ground corn, 2 of bran and 1 of linseed oil meal is an excellent mixture of which the lambs may eat at will. They will also relish some of the finest and choicest legume hays. At the Illinois Station young growing lambs, nursing their dams and eating grain and alfalfa hay in a creep, produced 100 pounds of gain in weight on about 40 pounds of grain and 50 pounds of hay. Compare that to 350 pounds of grain and 100 pounds of hay needed to add 100 pounds gain to western lambs and judge as to its economy. In case the ewes and their lamb- are on very good blue grass pastures the returns may be very similar without the use of grain. When blue grass pastures are used it is not uncommon to find that the Iambs will eat only very small amounts oi grain even though they have constant access to it in the creeps. The "marking" (docking and castrating) of lambs is considered one of the important practices which successful sheep men follow. Methods of operation differ; each has advantages and disadvantages. Select a method you think you will like and "mark" your lambs. That'B the important thing and is the only way of getting the "long tails" off the market. It would be a boom to the sheep industry if our markets adopted a definite policy of regularly cutting the price on all ram lambs two or three cents a pound. </seg>

Brag about its goodness to your neighbors ; have faith in your product and increase the consumption of lamb. Up to the present Nebraska's reputation in this respect is none too good. Increasing the consumption of lamb, however, is without question one of the leading issues concerning farm sheep raising. A good product will help.

I hope I haven't bored you too much. If you have any questions that I can answer I will be glad to do so. QUESTION: Do legumes effect sheep by bloat like they do cattle? MR. K.AMMLADE : Somewhat, alfalfa is perhaps the worst to cause bloat. Red Clover is next and sweet clover will very, very seldom produce bloat. I have a sneaking Idea that this depends somewhat on the individuality of the sheep. We have had ewes in our flock that will bloat no matter what you give them'. We get them out on 'green and they will bloat up and fly away. On the contrary, we have taken for three years now, lambs direct from the western range. We have run them out on green alfalfa in September and we have never had a case of bloat. Just turn them out and let them go. I think there is something about the individuality of the sheep or the way they digest their feed causes some to bloat more frequently and more severely than others. But it is a pretty safe! practice. When we undertake anything foolish like that we just say! that it is an experiment station and let it go at that, but I think it is well to give them a good feed of dry roughage before you turn them out. 1 QUESTION: What about alfalfa? Sometimes it is a.little mouldy. MR. KAMMLADE: Mouldy feed is always dangerous no matter whether it is alfalfa or regular feeds. You can't tell by looking at it Some mouldy feed is alright and of course it depends on the variety of the mould.

We buy a lot of feed from Nebraska. qlKSTlON: I),, you think sheep are not as liable to bloat as cattle? From your .statement I would judge sheep are not as liable to bloat. Take for instance turning your sheep on to green alfalfa. Mr. Kammlaik'-. Well, 1 know you can't but we have done it back there. Of course we can't advocate it but we do do it, because just as soon as you advocate it somebody is going to have a lot of bloated cattle or sheep on his hands. I don't know that there is very much difference. I believe if you would turn a bunch of cattle on green alfalfa, you would have a number of bloated ones. We have had a number of advices not to do that from feeders, that they would blow up, and 1 thought they would, but they didn't. QUESTION: What do you think of sweet clover for pasture': MR. KAMM1.ADK-. It is not as good from the standpoint of grow - ing lambs or from the standpoint of, well I guess it is not good for maintaining sheep, but more from the standpoint of lambs, as alfalfa, pasture or a mixed pasture of blue grass, and I would use it under farm flock conditions. I would make sweet clover my pasture. While it is not particularly palatable and it won't produce the gains which we can get on alfalfa or mixed pastures, still we can get enough to make it worthwhile to use it. Just as Mr. Weber says, a lot of traditions and things grow up, but you go to any experiment station, I cannot pay your expenses or anything of that sort as I have enough trouble maintaining myself, but you go and grind feed and if the whole ones don't beat the ground ones, you are a good experimenter in favor of the ground stuff. I have always been able, to advise the ether way. QUESTION: Is cane a good roughage for breeding ewes? MR. KA.MMI.ADK: Now you will have to ask Weber ov somebody else for that as we don't raise cane in Illinois except in Chicago. QUESTION: Do you recommend minerals? MR. KAMMLADE: I didn't recommend minerals. I said put min - erals on your soil. Raise legumes on your soil that produce minerals. In that country we never feed minerals except as an experimental feeding. Of course you have to supply salt in addition. You might call salt a mineral, but we never feed minerals except experimentally to our sheep. QUESTION: By having sheep on sweet clover, are they subject to getting lame or sore feet? I had a bunch of ewes on pasture and as quite a few of them were lame I thought it was probably due to that. </seg>

Gentlemen: It is hard sometimes to recognize permanent changes in the feeding industry because of the fluctuations which we have from year to year, however, the permanent change that has taken place in the type of western range lambs has been f very decided. Ten or fifteen years ago the average feeder lamb off'jttie range weighed around 50 to 55 pounds and was small, light boned and rather on the order of a cull. Now, because of improved breeding and because of the deterioration of the western ranges, we get a very different type, , heavy, big framed and stretchy, but not fat. Out of about 80,000 1 lambs on which a record was kept in northern Colorado last year, the </seg>
            <seg id="p588">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE average weight into the feed lot ran 65 pounds and most of these lambs coming into the feed lots were big, thrifty lambs yet they were for the most part thin. So when you come to the question of handling western lambs in cornfields in Colorado you must figure your average lambs off the western ranges today are going to be big, thrifty, heavy-boned, and that they are not going to be carrying very much flesh. This works an added hardship on the feeder because of the consumer's demand for lighter finished lambs. Heavy Grain Feeding Responsible For Most Death Losses Lambs are peculiar in their ability to take a certain amount of grain without trouble — and no more. After years of feeding in the West, feeders are coming to realize that heavy grain feeding is responsible for most feed lot losses occuring after the first few weeks of feeding. These losses have been blamed on many things; mouldy hay, lack of minerals, and other causes, but indications all point toward too heavy grain feeding. In dry lot feeding the average experienced feeder takes about six weeks to put lambs on a full grain feed of 1 to 1.5 pounds. Lambs are brought up to a pound of grain very gradually, for once off feed they never respond to a full grain feed in a normal way. Even with such precautions, digestive disturbances occur. The sudden change from mother's milk and dry range grass to the richer feeds on the farm must be made with care. Now, with these things in mind, what about cornfield feeding? At the outset we must recognize two different classes of sheep, natives raised on the farm and western sheep raised on the range. Our experience has shown that farm raised lambs are much more safely handled in the cornfields than range lambs. Give Other Feeds Before Turning on to Corn The general recommendations in cornfield feeding are fairly simple. Lambs are turned into the cornfield about September first. They are fed alfalfa hay, sometimes oil meal. Rape or soybeans are often planted with the corn or in adjoining field3. Under ordinary field feeding conditions they are fattened off in a 60 to 90 day feeding period, making from 15 to 25 pounds gain and using from 1.75 to 2.25 bushels of corn per head. They eat little alfalfa, usually one-half to two-thirds pounds per day and ordinarily a 40 bushel yield of corn will carry about 20 lambs. Feed costs are usually about 15 per cent less than in dry lot. If it were not for death losses cornfield fattening would be very simple. What usually happens is this: During the first </seg>
            <seg id="p589">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK 13HEEDERS' ASSOCIATI few weeks the lambs find plenty of green feed, leaves and weeds and eat very little, if any corn. Then the corn! is exposed to view. They get a taste for it and the problem is how to keep them from eating too much. Will limiting the time on corn be effective? Observations have shown that in one hour jmany lambs will consume the equivalent •of three ears of com or during two one hour periods in a day, from two . to four pounds. Apparently limiting the time alone is not sufficient. It has been our observation that one way to control amount of corn eaten in pasturing corn is first to fill the lambs up each day . with a variety of feeds before they are given access to the cornfield, so that they will not be able to consume enough grain to hurt them. ■ A successful feeder in Colorado uses a certain system in cornfield feeding. Each morning his lambs are taken from the pen and herded slowly over alfalfa stubble, through a field of piled beet tops, then through the cornfield and finally back to the alfalfa feeders in the pens. ■ Each aftesnoon the same procedure is followed. The sche - dule is so regular that each day at the same hour the lambs may be found at about the same place. This system which requires very little labor after the lambs become' accustomed to it, has been very effective in producing good gains and cutting 1 down death losses. It has been successful in filling up the lambs and limits the consumption of corn. Of course, a system in which one could pasture the lambs rather than herd them would be simpler yet. It is sometimes recommended that a small portion of the cornfield be separated off with a temporary fence and pastured, then another portion and so on. This scheme should work well with constant supervision. The danger lies here in judging just when to change the lambs to a fresh field. This would be especially true where 1,000 or 1,500 lambs were handled] Stock Beet. Go Well With Cornfield Feeding At the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station we have done some work with stock beets; or mangles in connection with cornfield feeding in an attempt to develop a pasturing rather than a herding scheme. We turned lambs onto a field of stock beets at seven o'clock each morning and then into the cornfield at 11 a. m. where they were left until 4:00 p. m. when they were put back into dry lot on alfalfa self-feeders. One acre of corn and .2 acre of stock beets carried 40 lambs 81 days and produced 24 pounds gain as compared with 22 . pounds gain in dry lot. The lambs were not well enough finished for market at the e-nd of this field feeding test but were finished during a 30 day feed in dry lot. The use of the pastured stock beets cheapened the cost of gain, increased the gain over dry lot and straight cornfield </seg>

Tight-Fleeced Northern Lambs Are Beit We have also found that type and breed have somewhat to do . with success in cornfield lamb feeding where range lambs are used. We used different breeds representing the main classes of feeder lambs from the range. They were grade Hampshires or black faces from Wyoming, Rambouillets from Utah, Corriedales from the U. S. Government Experiment Station at Dubois, Idaho and Southerns (a light pelted grade Rambouillet) from New Mexico, and Arizona. We found that the compact fleeced hardy northern lambs such as the Rambouillets from Utah stood adverse weather conditions best and made the heaviest gains. The black faces and Corriedales gave ' practically as good results. We found the Southerns, however, not at all suited for cornfield feeding. They come off the ranges later in the fall, sometimes late in October and cornfield lambs should be started early in September. They are light pelted and not nearly as hardy as the other breeds and they show much lighter gains and heavier losses in the cornfield, though a desirable feedlot type. ■ COMPARISON OF GRADE RANGE LAMBS OF DIFFERENT BREEDS IN THE CORNFIELD New Mex. and Arizona Northern Southern RambouilUt Hampshire Corriedale Rambouillet Daily Gain 0.25 0.24 0.23 0.16 Average Gain 22;7 21.9 20.6 14.7 Loss 2.0 3.0 3.0 5.0 Cornfield lamb feeding appeals to the feeder for under favorable conditions it will produce quick heavy gains and at a low cost but every precaution must be taken to safeguard against excessive death losses. Supplemental forage, stock beets, protein concentrates and method of handling can protect against loss. I believe it is a practice which will never be safe for everybody but which can be used to advantage where a system is devised and with good supervision. QUESTION: What have your summaries regarding (death losses?- </seg>
            <seg id="p591">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATIC . PROP. MAYNARD: After the first few weeks in the feed lot the principal cause of death losses is a tod heavy grain feed and the more variety you can get in the lamb fattening ration, that is, using grain and some legume hay and then whatever supplementary feed you might have available like corn silage, corn fodder, or of course the beet by-products as we have out there, these things tend to check death losses but we have found that most of our death losses are caused by too heavy a grain ration. Early in the feeding period you have a possibility of hemorrahagic septicaemia, or of typhoid, or pneumonia or other diseases picked up readily at that time because of low vitality. Maintaining the vitality of the lambs from range to feed lot is an important factor in disease control. This may be done best by adequate feeding enroute.

They bring out their best horses or they will bring but a poor one if they happen to have it in order to make a class that will teach these boys how to judge horses.

            <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATI I Nine Horses Pulling a Three Bottom Tractor Plow on the Hugh McLaughlin Farm — Red Willow County You have asked me for my opinion as to the way to solve the Farm Power Problem and I lepeat that the only practical remedy is to ; • breed bigger and better horses and hitch them in bigger units when there is a bigger piece of machinery to haul. Until sufficient bigger and better horses can be bred and raised, more small ones will have to be hitched in big teams. Nebraska Needs More Team Demonstrations If this problem really is solved in the State of Nebraska, the Extension Department of this school should put at least two men at horse work on full time and if you will co-operate with the Horse Association of America, thai organization will gladly assist you. The College may put up the excuse of not having the means, but the money will be provided somehow if you can show your President and Dean the importance of this work. ■ The solving of the farm power problem in the state of Nebraska is | more serious than most of us realize. The horses of this state are not only getting old, but they are already old, and it takes too long to grow a horse to servicable age to delay breeding operations longer. The farmers know it is high time to raise replacements but on account !of the recent depression in the horse business and agriculture in general, and because some farmers believed that the horse was about to be replaced with substitutes, many of "them have become a bit indifferent as to the class of replacements they should try to raise and the care of their colts after getting them. ■ Horse Consumes Farm-Grown Fuel • We are not knocking the great manufacturers of motive power, as we concede the automobile has the driving horse definitely off the highways of this country, and the truck has its place on all long distance hauls, and the tractor has its place for belt power. But for all short hauls in the cities' and for such service as delivering milk, ice cream and all kinds of stop and start deliveries the horse is by far the more economical power and is more than holding its own for such work in the big cities. On the if arm the horse is not only the most economical and efficient power for all field work, but we must remember that he is consuming some of the products that we are producing and right at this time agriculture is not in condition to send more money East than we are now sending to keep us in all the automobiles, gas and machinery we are now purchasing. </seg>
            <seg id="p594">KKI-oKT OI-" \Ki:i;.\Sl\A STATK liOAUI) OF AllKU'ULTURR We should take into consideration the fact that farm produce has not increased i:; value in the same proportion as manufactured goods or the cost of labor for the reason that the big industry has the protection ol an unprecedented high tariff and labor is perfectly organized anil has the protection of a strict immigration law which keeps out the cheap laoor that would like to come into this country; there is also a transportation act for the railroads which practically guarantee them a lair return on their investments and we have elastic banking laws for the great financial interest. The farmer's prices ait now, and have been, on a Very nearly pre-war basis for the past sevtn years, while retail prices of most manufactured goods are almost on a war time level. We larmera have also tried for some legislation but our bills get vetoed. We have tried to control product. Oil and to establish co-operative market - ing, but thus far our efforts in tni.s direction have not been very successful. The cotton growers of the south gave us a fair example of how the farmer reduces production when a great effort was made in 1926 to reduce the cotton acreage. Instead of every farmer reducing his own acreage, as advised to do, he figured that the other fellow surely would do that and the result was the record breaking crop of 1926. Cotton fell from 18 cents in the fall of 1925 to 10 cents at the time of marketing the 1926 crop. We have about so much to pay out every year, and instead of reducing production under present conditions, we are forced to make every acre yield the maximum. If we cannot reduce production we should certainly use the kind of farm power that consumes part of our production and so reduces our embarrassing surplus. More Colts Needed for Replacements For one farmer or one community of farmers to each substitute one team of horses with motor power does not amount to much, but if every farmer in the country would do this same thing, agriculture would receive the hardest blow that has ever hit it, as we would not be able to curtail production to the amount the replaced horses are consuming. Motorization of our farms will be imperative though, unless the farmers of this country begin to raise more horse replace - ments and do it now. The U. S. Census shows a decrease of 2,933,000 horses and mules in this country from January 1st, 1920 to January 1st 1925. This would indicate well over 5,000,000 horses have been displaced in the past ten years. If each of these horses would consume 100 bushels </seg>
            <seg id="p595">XKBKASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATE ■' ■ ■ ". of grain per year, or the equivalent in grain pasture and hay, we would have a market for 500,000,000 additional bushels of grain. This is many times the amount of our annual exports of corn and oats, and is almost- one-half of our total average annual oat crop. Were we now working jiothing but our own power on the farms, instead of sending the money that is going out of the cornbelt to pay for substitutes and fuel, there would be a lot more money in our banks and we would be getting more mpney for our produce and. we would be doing our work more economically. It is estimated that over 600,000 farmers quit the farm last year and I believe there will be a lot more to follow unless we farmers do what we can for ourselves, and one very big item will be to solve the farm power problem by breeding bigger and better horses and then hitch them in bigger units when required. The most important work this great Agricultural College could do at this critical moment in agriculture would be to show all the farmers of Nebraska how to hitch and drive big teams and encourage them in the breeding of better horses and in that way grow, all the power for your own use. By so doing, you would teach your farmers the most efficient use of the most economical and elastic j farm power, the production and use of which would consume the surplus of your grains and feed, and so enhance the value of all other farm produce. PROFESSOR WEBER: We would be glad to have you ask any questions. Mr. Holbert will be glad to answer them. •■•i:ri -.■■•■■! QUESTION: How does our horse situation in the United States Compare with the horse situation in the foreign countries that you have visited. MR. HOLBERT: I have spent five months in Belgium and France this last summer. They don^t have to contend with the motor power problem at all. There was a time when the tractor broke into the country but they just simply have to fight the tractor because it was never an economy, in that country. They have the best of us • because of the fact that we never got on to the big hitch proposition. They have always been used in the European horse breeding countries. I will say one thing that over in the state of Iowa, we surely have • got them turned wrong side up when it comes to their motor power problems. We have about three men on motor power, but our horse men have the facts in their favor. ■•;:.:.:;•: i . ;■/; ■ : .. .We sold about six head of stallions two years ago, and we took a trip up through that country and we found so many good colts we </seg>

We offered $100 to the horse that had sired the seven best colts. They were offering $5, $3, and $2, and we put up $100, but that didn't suit us. We asked for $500 and finally they said if we would put up $125 they would put up $500 and we got $25 from the State Department of, Agriculture and they furnished the ribbons. Those barns are pretty small and we had 50 head of colts. First prize was $40 for males and $40 for females, and the prizes ranged down to $15 for tenth place. Our prize went to the seven colts produced by the same sire. It is just like catching the fellow that kidnapped the little girl out in California. Whenever you put up big enough money you can sure get the colts. Waterloo had the same proposition. Next year the State Fair has offered the same proposition. So has the National Belgian Show. The State Department put on about ten other colt snows last year. We think in Iowa we have got the horse so that ; he is pretty well on his way back. It might be a stallion proposition to a certain orient. In order to raise the kind of horses we want to raise-, it takes good stallions. There is a demand for the good"horse. You don't need to worry but what the breeders of this state will produce the right kind of stallions to produce the right kind of. colts that we must have. Thank you. PROFESSOR WEBER: Mr. Holbert spoke of the big hitch as the solution of the farm power problem. Most of you know Mr. M. B. Posson who used to be the Extension Animal Husbandman. He is now on a ranch in western Nebraska. He has done considerable work with big hitches. Mr. Waggener who is now the Extension Animal Husbandman has also done some work on this problem. Some of the county agents are putting on these demonstrations and are doing very good work. One • of these county agents who has been very successful in this work is Mr. V. J. Heine of Holdrege. He is here today and is going to talk to you or demonstrate probably, on How Many To Hitch. For those of you who came in late, I want it understood that the subject 'How Many to Hitch' refers entirely to horses. Although you may be hitched or going to be hitched, we are not going to tell you how many to hitch. Mr. Heine: </seg>

            <seg id="p598">IIKI'OKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to the plow. Mr. Schandoney was a farm boy, who in driving a ten mule string team in the Sacremento Valley, observed that in the hitching that the lazy horses were practically free, thus making a dead load on the more energetic horses. He worked out an equalizer to make the slower horses pull their share of the load. From the time of his invention, his hitch has been the important hitch used in big team operations in both farming and freighting. Later, a man by the name of Talkintfton, invented a hitch that was an improvement over the Schandoney hitch, in having more flexibility, simplicity and lightness. By changing the length of the equalizer, it can be used either as a string or bunch team hitch. Every Horse Pulls His Share in a Big Team A large number of horses, up to fifty, can be driven by means of this hitch so that each horse must pull his share of the load and no horse can pull more than his load. Two lines are all that is needed on the lead team to control the entire hitch. The hitch has this advantage also, when the lead team steps up each succeeding team takes up the load, the front team takes a step, it tightens the tugs on the next team and they pick up the load in such a way that there is not a dead pull in starting. This prevents any whipping as is caused on the large abreast teams when the hovses on the one side get a quick start. They throw the horses on the other side of the evener off of their balance and the team begins to "see-saw" back and forth. This is impossible with this type of hitch because it is just a matter of following the leaders and the flexibility of the hitch gives each horse ■ a chance to get into the collar before the load is started. Don't get the idea that this hitch is only practical on big units, you may not have machinery large enough to hitch a ten horse team but the same principles will apply on the smaller units from three up to fifty. If you are workinjr four horses on a plow, why not put on an extra horse and make it five? If you are working five, the sixth horse will put that much more pep into the gait of the team nr-. 1 . will keep the outfit moving. In other words, where much larger teams are not practical, I would advocate using these hitches and adding a horse or two so as to take off the heavy drag when just enough horses were hitched to pull the load. Use Horses Enough to do a Standard Day'* Work There is such a thing as a standard day's work in plowing — a standard easily observed and applicable to any farm. It requires that teams shall move 20 miles a day in actual tillage operations. Distance covered in turning at ends or to and from the barns, is not </seg>

Get one of the little pamphlets from the Horse Association that will be distributed and go home and try this hitch. All you need to construct it will be a log chain or two and some hard wood sticks. You can make it in a few hours on your farm. You can even cut down some hard wood trees and hue out the pieces that you need so that the cost will be very little. The big hitch gives you the opportunity to use the horses that you have on the farm in bigger, efficient operations and use some of the cheap grains as fuel irt the cheapest and best locomotives yet devised. QUESTION: Where do you put a green horse? MR. HEINS: We put a green horse right next to the draw bar. Take a green horse,, put him in next to the draw bar and he has to stay in his place, that is about all there is to it, because he is chained to it and has to follow the horse directly in front of him and he can't get too far ahead because the buck rope and tie chain keep him in place. QUESTION: Will he step over the chains? MR. HEINE: A horse is not likely to step over those chains. I know the experience we had out in our county. The people were very skeptical about not knowing how to hook those horses right. We just plowed out a small land and after making a few turns, the most skeptical man in the crowd said he guessed that it was alright. The horses quickly find their places within the hitch and stay there, and as soon as they become used to it, you can give them a little more length on the lead chain and ease up on the buck rope, and you will find more opportunities of fighting flies than they would have if they were hitched in the regular way. QUESTION : For a two bottom plow do you recommend that hitch? MR. HEINE: Put two behind and three in the lead. We have used it very successfully in our county, and people who have used it say they wouldn't go back to the old system. MR WEBER A demonstration of this team hitch will be given right away just outside. If you get a chance, go outside and see the team hitched. That will conclude the program. • Following the program a hitch demontration showing 1 the method of driving horses in large units by the "buck back", "tie in" process was staged by Mr. Waggener in co-operation with the Horse Depart - ment of the College of Agriculture. Practically all those in attendance at the meeting inspected the hitches and observed them in operation. , </seg>

LOEFFEL, Chairman Mr. ' Waggener: Gentlemen: This modern age is an age of substitutes. We have substitutes for meat. Henry Ford is talking about substitutes for milk and the General Motors Company is talking about substitutes for Fords. In fact we have substitutes for everything. We planned to give you an old fashioned program without a single substitute, but things somewhat modern creep in, "and so this morning we are going to present you with one substitute and I am it I have the pleasure of substituting for three nice looking girls who know how to judge meat. If you think I can substitute for all those, well all right, and if you don't all right, for. I am going to substitute anyhow. I might be a little like Pat and Mike were about Pat's condition of starvation. Pat says: "What's the matter with you this morning?" Mike: "Starvation is staring me in the face." "Sure, and I don't think it would be very pleasant for either of you." The girls were going to give you a little work on "Before and After", showing you something of what a carcass looks like on foot as compared to what it looks like after it is on the hooks, but since the ladies wanted them on their program over in the Home Economics Section, we felt it better to send them over to the ladies' program, and start our program off a few minutes earlier, by virtue of their absence, and if anything, get through a little earlier, in order to get on to this country buying debate, which it appears is going to a trifle more time than it was scheduled. Your chairman this morning is a man that knows hogs from A to Z. He does, not only look at hogs from the outside but from the inside as well. The other, day he was figuring up and said that if the small intestines of the hogs that he has butchered were all put together end to end, that you could start feeding the hog the day •t was born, and none of the food would reach its large intestine before it died. That is how many hogs Bill has killed. Mr. Loeffel. MR LOEFFEL: Polks, that is' quite an assignment, I am sure. Now we have quite a full program this morning, and it appears from the interest which has been aroused on the matter of country buying, that we are going to need every minute of time that we can scrape up for the program for the discussion of country buying. I think we will omit the flowers and start right in with the program. </seg>
            <seg id="p602">KK1MIRT &lt;&gt;F NKBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE Unquestionably one of the big factors in profit and loss of hog operations is the toll exacted from disease. If we could eliminate the loss from disease, unquestionably we could eliminate many of the unprofitable features of our pork producing business. I don't mean from that that we could raise more pigrs, necessarily, but we could cut down the number of sows to produce a given number of pigs. Instead of keeping 10 sows, why not keep 8 sows and raise the same number of pigs? Certainly it would be an economy in production. I don't believe there is any man on the campus who is better qualified to talk to you about pig diseases than Dr. Alford. I think Dr. Alford is well known to all people, and I am very glad indeed, and I think we are very fortunate in having a man like Dr. Alford, whom we can call upon and consult in the matter of hog diseases. Dr. Alford. SOME PIG TROUBLES AND THEIR CONTROL DR. S. \V. ALFORD Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: It seems like foolishness to me to a certain extent, to kept appearing before you men here and elsewhere, to talk this thing of swine disease. It seems to me like we have about run the thing into the ground, but when we go around over the country, and see the loss from disease in the swine herds in the various parts of the state, you feel like you have just begun to talk about the subject. Intensive Production Causes Many Troubles It is true, as Mr. Loeffel says, that if we could just cut down on our losses from disease, certainly our pork production would be more economical, and would be more money in our pockets. But I don't know just how we are going to do that. That will not be accomplished in a year or so. You know this disease business is getting worse and worse each year. You fellows can remember that only a few years a^o, we had never heard of such a thing as flu, or enteritis, or necro a* it is sometimes called, or pig typhoid and a lot of other things. And it Vias only been in the last few years that we have had these things to deal with. 1 think the main reason for this trouble lies with our system of pork production. The same thing holds true of beef, poultry, and most any other livestock that we have on the place. Take for instance, we will start with the cow. The cow is normally an animal that reproduces once a year. Now then she produces a calf oftener than one a year. In fact, within a very short time after the calving, .she is in calf again. That has led us into trouble in </seg>
            <seg id="p603">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATK the way of breeding problems. We never knew what sterility was, or breeding problems were, until we began to do this intensive breed - ing and feeding with our cattle. So that is the way in which you are paying for this intensive breeding and feeding program you are carrying on with your cattle. The same thing holds true with poultry. You did not know what these diseases in poultry were a. few years ago, but with all the intensive breeding 1 and housing 1 with poultry, you pay for it in the form of disease. The same thing holds true with hogs. A few years ago, before the hog population became so dense as it is, and before we kept the. hogs under the conditions in which they are kept, we did not know what a lot of these disease were. We never heard of them. So that is the way we pay for our intensive program for any line of livestock handling. The chicken and the hog are a little better example for this thing than are the other livestock, because the chicken and the hog are what we might call ground feeders. They feed from the ground entirely, unless they are artificially fed. The natural place for a chicken and a hog to get its food is from the ground. Con - sequently, they are subject to the infections which accumulate in the soil, that is, they are subject to the results from the infections that ac - cumulate in the soil, for the reason that they pick up this infection from the natural method of obtaining their food. The older the country becomes and the greater the hog population becomes in the territory, the greater the trouble becomes. The same thing would happen to the hog population as would happen to the human population, if in a town like Lincoln, where there is approxi - mately 65,000 people, congregated together in a small area, if there were no sanitary methods of any kind exercised in our existence here, I dare say that if we would do away with all of our sanitary control measures that the Health Department has the power to^ enforce here in this city, that within a very short time we would suffer the ravages of diseases of various kinds here in the human family, or the human population in the city. With the hog, we have had no way of enforcing any kind of sanitary regulations, consequently the hog has been living for the past several years in the same old hog lot, and year by year saturating the soil with the excreta of his body, and the longer he lives in that hog- lot the more thouroughly saturated the soil becomes, with all kinds of organisms, many of which are natural habitat of the intestinal tract of the hog. There are a lot of hogs, in fact practically all hogs. that apparently are in normal condition, harbor certain bacteria in ■ the intestinal tract. Under or - dinary conditions, those bacteria are harmless, but when these mature ■ hogs begin to pass these infections to the small pigs, and the small pig is the one that is most susceptible to these infections, the trouble </seg>
            <seg id="p604">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE begins. The infection which these mature hogs carry is not of a very virulent type, in fact, a low type, but when you pass this low type of infection normally present in the intestinal tract of healthy, mature hogs to the young and more susceptible pig, the virulence of this infection increases, and by the time the infection has passed through two or three pigs, it makes itself known without any question of a doubt. You fellows have all had hog lot sanitation preached to you. The Extension Department, through the efforts of Mr. Posson and Mr. Waggener, has told you about hog lot sanitation for the past several years, and there is hardly any use to take much time in going over that thing again. There is a factor in hog lot sanitation that is due some consideration, and that is the character of the soil on which you fellows have to operate your hog production program. You know there are several different kinds of soil — what we call in hog lot sanitation, a permeable soil and an impermeable soil. What we mean by impermeable soil is a soil like we have in this country, and a soil in which the infection remains very largely on the surface, and if this infection remains on the surface the hogs are more likely to pick it up. Consequently our sanitation problem in this section and farther east, is a greater one than it is out west where we have a permeable soil. I think you fellows will all agree that their pig troubles are probably less out west than they are down in this part of the country. Vaccinate Against Cholera Now there are just two or three things that I wanted to mention here in regard to hog production, and it would be useless to try to touch all of them, because we would just be able to touch the high spots, and we would get nothing out of any of them. As I see it, from my experience with hog diseases, we have just about two im - portant things to consider. The first one, I think beyond any question of a doubt, is hog cholera. We have hog cholera with us all of the time. It becomes a serious matter occasionally and is less serious during the intermediate time. Now hog cholera is rather a peculiar disease. You no doubt recall the epidemic of hog cholera which we had last year, which took about two weeks to cover the entire eastern section of the state. This year we. had a lot of cholera scattered around in various neighborhoods of the state, but it did not take on an epedemic form like it did last year. Now why it did not, I am unable to say, and don't think anybody else can explain why. We know that every four or five or six years, we have an epidemic of hog cholera which spreads rapidly and the type of infection is very virulent. It kills quickly. With the state of Nebraska situ- </seg>
            <seg id="p605">I ' ■ ■ ■ ■ • , NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATJ ated the way it) is, you might say right in the hog belt, we will always have hog choljera to contend with. You fellows may think that - because you didn't have hog' cholera this year, that there wasn't any. Hog cholera is] always a factor with us in this section of ,the state because with tne hog population which we have, and Nebraska situated in the bog bel as it is, hog cholera is always going to be a factor in hog product on. Sanitation measures will not control hog cholera by any means. The other factor entering into swine production which 1 am going to menti&lt; n is sanitation. When hog cholera gets ready to swoop down on us, ii; will come regardless of the conditions in which the swine are kep :. There are certain conditions where pigs are well and thrifty anc are kept in sanitary environment, and are not exposed to diseases of any kind, which renders them resistant to diseases of any kind, but 'that doesn't mean they are immune to hog cholera. We can't do anything, we can't tell you anything about how you should control Jhog cholera. The only way it can be controlled is by continued vaccination and that is up to you fellows. If you fellows don't want to vaccinate, that is up to you. That is the only way we will ever te able to check hog cholera. If 85 to 90% of the hogs in the state were vaccinated every year, we would not have these epidemics of hog cholera because there would be no susceptible pigs there in which for it to operate, but when vaccination diminishes to 4 and 5 per cent of the hogs in the state, leaving the other 90 to 95 per cent of the hogs susceptible to hog cholera, and then when hog cholera takes &gt;n its active virulent form as it is in the habit of doing periodically, we cannot expect anything but a bad epidemic or an outbreak of hog cholera with 90 to 95 per cent of susceptible swine in the country in which to operate. ■i ■ ■ I ' ' ' ' ■' I ..;'.-. Demand for Serum is Irregular It might be well to go ahead and mention a little bit about the serum production business right at this time. The production of serum is. sort of a hand to mouth proposition. 1 You are dealing with a rather perishable product in one respect. ' Serum is not a very perishable product, but the expiration date government requires to be placed on it, leads the user to believe that it is and the serum producer has to handle it accordingly. The serum producer is handl - ing what is called a perishable' product, and has to be moved in a certain length of time. When you fellows quit vaccinating and the demand for this product falls off, what does he have to do? Why he has to cut down his production accordingly. He can't go ahead and produce serum at full speed if there is no market for it. He can't store up a lot of serum to protect you fellows and take a chance of </seg>
            <seg id="p606">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE throwing a lot -of it into the river. As a result, when you fellows quit vaccinating, he quits producing and the more you fellows cut down on vaccinating the more he cuts down production. A good example of that is the condition in which we were caught last year (1926) along in September. The production of serum last summer, in July and August (1926) was at the very minimum because there was no demand for it. Nobody was using serum, consequently all of the plants shut down. Hop cholera swooped down on us in September, and seemed to hit us all at once. Then everybody wanted serum. All wanted it right then, large quantities of it. Those who could have protected their herds in the spring and summer with 3,000 cc of serum were asking for 10,000 when hog cholera hit them. The hogs 'were much larger and required more serum. A lot of them had cholera and were increasing the doses and as a result, they were asking for about four or five times as much as they would have used had they asked for it at the proper time. So the result was — you fellows know what the result was. You couldn't get it. You had to wait until it could be produced. A lot of serum plants were idle and you had to wait. Hog cholera can only be controlled by vaccination, and that lies in the hands of you fellows. Sanitation Controls Many Diseases Now there are certain* other diseases that are termed filth borne diseases. They are acquired through the filth that accumulates in the hog lots. The one and most important of these is what we call pig typhoid, otherwise known as necro. That disease is increasing to an alarming extent. That is purely a filth disease that can be handled only from a sanitary standpoint. You will have to rely upon sanitary measures to control this disease, and not combat by the use of chemical ajrents. I think that is out of the question to combat this hog disease by chemical agents. You will have to rely upon sanitary measures entirely. You fellows can see for yourself that if you are raising hogs on old lots year after year, the infection is continuously and constantly accumulating and increasing in the soil from the body excreta. The hog is compelled to remain in that hog lot and eat his food from the ground, picking up this infection year after year, and the result will be that eventually he is not going to be able to stand this thing. As I said before, the larger hog or the older hog is more or less immune to this trouble. I think you will find it true that the older hog gives less trouble than the pig. The age is a factor that has to be considered in this disease. The old hog is what we call a carrier of this infection or a spreader of this infection, and may be of a rather low type of virulency, but when it gets to the little pig that is very susceptible to this trouble, the virulence of this organism increases </seg>
            <seg id="p607">NEBRASKA 1MPU0VKD LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATI and as a result causes more or less trouble with it. Now tucie » only one thing that we can recommend for you fellows to practice, and that is the rotation of hog lots. I think that every hog raiser ' that raises hogs to any degree or raises hogs to any extent, should have at least three yards or lots which he could use for that purpose. He should raise his hogs in one lot for one year and in the next year he should raise them in the other lot and put the lot that he Taised the hogs in the previous year, in some kind of a crop. The soil has the faculty of purifying itself if you give it a chance. But if you are going to raise- hogs on that lot continuously, . the hogs will deposit more infection than the soil can take care of, consequently, the accumulation of the infection is the reason why we are having this trouble now that we didn't have a few years ago. So it is really a matter of pig lot rotation just the same as the rotation of your crops. Now there were fellows brought to my attention this past year, that although they moved their hogs out of the old lots to clean soils they continued to have trouble with this enteritis, or necro, or pig typhoid, or whatever you want to call it, but on questioning them, I got these fellows that complained that there is nothing: to this hog: lot sanitation program, in questioning them we always found a loop-hole in their program. They- always fell down," or stumbled, or blundered^ somewhere. In order to accomplish best results, the sanitation program must be consistent. If only partially carried out, you will get partial results but not results you should. Hog Cholera Breaks Are Result of Necro Now there is a certain factor in connection with the vaccination of swine for hog cholera that no doubt many of you fellows have experienced that I want to call your attention to before 1 close and that is that there seems to be a certain relation between this pig i typhoid organism and hog cholera virus. A certain reciprocal relation. It'seems like that in the presence of hog cholera virus, the pig typhoid organism gains in its virulence to some extent. We have, as well as other serum handlers, have what we call "breaks" to contend with following vaccination. In many' of the so-called breaks following vaccination, we find associated with hog cholera pronounced cases of pig typhoid, or enteritis, or necrotic enteritis, or whatever you are a mind to call it, which seems to make its appearance shortly following vaccination. So there seems to be a certain reciprocal relation be - tween hog cholera virus and the typhoid organism, and you fellows that make a practice of vaccinating hogs under all sorts of conditions are going to have two things to contend with. It is not the fault of I the serum. It is not the fault of the virus and it is not the fault of 1 the method used, or anything like that. I think the fault largely lies .'■••■■■ .1 . ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p608">Cm; 15K1HIKT OF NKBHA8KA STATIC 11OAUI) OF .VIHH'VLTVHK with the condition of the pig at the time they are vaccinated. If they are harboring a virulent type of pig typhoid organism and hog cholera virus is injected at the time of vaccination, there is liable to spring up about 7 to 10 days following vaccination, an outbreak of h.ig cholera and pig typhoid or enteritis. So many, many times where this occurs, the first thought that comes into the swine owner's mind is that it is the fault of the serum, or else he did a bad job of vaccinating. When in fact, he has to deal with a mixture of diseases, which is caused by a mixture of filth borne pig typhoid organism and hog virus. We have certain men throughout the country that condemn vaccination on this very ground, that his pigs were apparently all right at the time they were vacc.nated, and he vaccinated and produced cholera in the herd and infected his premises with hog cholera. That is true but the per - centage of those cases is so small that one cannot condemn the general practice of vaccination for that reason. These are the two principal things that I had in mind to call to your attent.on this morning. If you have any questions in regard to problems that you are having on your farm in swine production I will be glad to answer them if I can. Thank you. MR. LOEFFEL, Chairman Folks we are running a little short, and we are going to need all of our time th.s morning for this country buying debate, as I imagine it seems to be the most talked of topic on the program. The next thing on the program is Mr. 0. 0. Waggener, who will talk to you on •He topic, "Th e Nebraska Pig Crop Contest". THE NEBRASKA PIG CROP CONTEST MR. 0. WAGGENER: If eleven men in Nebraska can manage their hog operations in such a way that every litter from every sow on every one of their farms weighs on the average over 1,385 pounds in six months, is it not reasonable to think that the state's average litter weight of approxi - mately 600 pounds at that age is much too small? Eleven men did make that average and here are a few of the outstanding facts about these men. Winners From All Part* of State In the first place, those men didn't all come from any one section or county of the state. Instead, they were scattered from Cheyenne county on the west to Saunders on the east, from Webster on the south to Colfax on the North, and were from farms as widely separated </seg>
            <seg id="p609">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATK and as divergent in output and farming practices as it is possible for farms to be and still farrow and feed hogs. They came from irri - gated farms and dry land farms, from rented farms and owner oper - ated farms, rofling farms and flat farms and highly productive farms and farms of ptor fertility. In fact about the only comparison that can be drawn between the farms from which these highly successful hog men came is that they were all pieces of land in the great state of Ne - braska and that each was being cultivated by a thrifty inhabitant and citizen of that great state. It would seem then that the location of the farm could not be considered a very decisive factor in the matter of efficient hog production. , ■■ Different Breeds and Feeds Used Moreover, those hogs which attained to that extraordinary average litter weight were not all of one breed, there being practically every breed of fat hogs and even one drove of crossbreds represented in the winning eleven. It is true, however, that although the hogs were not all ot one breed, all of them which made satisfactory completions were fairly well bred and of moderately stretchy type and conforma - tion. It would appear likely then that the matter of breed could not be considered a highly important factor in the successful production of good profitable average litters and that no one breed is outstanding in this respect. It is worihy of note that no two of these hog men used the same combination of feeds or exactly the same kind of supplementary feeds. None of them depended upon the use of the so-called and much advertised hog remedies to keep their hogs well or in condition; nor did any two of them use the same kind of hog minerals. Several used no minerals at all. Furthermore, none of them used any of the often supposed to be indispensable commercial pig meals for any great length of time, indicating that no one combination of feeds or no one pro - prietary feed or no given mineral combination is essential to rapid growth and efficient. gains in swine under Nebraska conditions. It is true, however, that all the hog men represented among the winners did use the ordinary simple feeds grown mostly on their own farms and supplemented these principally by such highly concentrated protein feeds as tankage, oil meal and cottonseed meal. The buildings and equipment on the various farms varied Some had large centrally located hoghouses with "concrete floors and feeding pens, some did not. Some had hog oners, some did not. Some were equipped with grinders on soaking devices for the preparation of the feed, some were not. Many had only the individual small A-type </seg>

But in reviewing the hog equip - ment 01 these taring three things deserve attention. Without exception lne»t men provided some means for their hogs to have good clean irtran water whenever they wanted it. Without exception they pro - vide! aek-ieeders that were clean, sure and of sufficient capacity to permit then hogs to have plenty of teed at all times, ana witnout exception they had a way of keeping their hogs in clean, uisease free quaiicio with ample protection from the weather, and plenty of green pasture until they had attained to the age of at least lour months. All Followed Sanitation When it came to the matter of disease prevention it was again a simple story. All of them saw to it tnat tneir sows were fairly free from dirt and filth before permitting them to enter their cleaned farrowing- quarters. To a man they practiced careful sanitation meas - ures throughout their entire operations. Every sow that entered and every pig that finished the contest had been carefully vaccinated with the serum and virus treatment against hog cholera. Hog con - ditioners, patent remedies and useless preventatives were found to be unnecessary, expensive, and out of place in the business of raising efficient, thrifty litters in these master hog men's farms. You have just heard about a lot of the things they didn't do. The question now is what did they do to achieve this success? Sur - prising as it may seem that is also a very simple story. They selected fairly well bred gilts, mated them carefully to a good boar, fed them bulky home grown rations that were high in protein content, and saw to it that their bowels were left open, and that they had plenty of exercise and did not become too fat during the gestation period. Before farrowing time, these gilts were brushed clean, put into scalded, disease free, well ventilated, warm, farrowing quarters. The pigs were creep fed, the young boars castrated while yet yjung, vaccinated at an early age, but not weaned at the same time they were vaccinated or castrated. The young pigs were given good protection from the weather and were self-fed a balanced ration, allowed plenty of pasture, and kept where water was available at all times. And what did they do? They all produced such rapid, cheap gains that every mother's son of those .hog owners got their pigs off to market early, while the demand was still good, and the price up. And which is more important, they all made some money. </seg>
            <seg id="p611">NEBRASKA! IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCMT1 The winners of the contest are as. follows, and I wish these men would kindlly step forward as I read their names: R. C.

            <seg id="p612">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR JOHNSON: I was somewhat surprised when Mr. Waggener notified me that I was one of the winners in the Nebraska Pig Crop. Contest, but I was more surprised when he told me I was high man, but I am sure more surprised that he has called upon me to give a talk. I don't know just what Mr. Waggener wants me to say this morning. While staying at the hotel, I jotted down a few points because last year I was caught this same way, and I can't hardly talk when I am prepared. But I did not get much done because I had to attend another meeting up to the Dairy Barn, and I just got in here a few minutes ago. Want* 2,000 Pound* of Pork From Every Sow I remember some statements that I made under circumstances similar to these last year. I made a statement that I was determined some day to produce 2,000 pounds of pork from every sow in the herd. I sure missed it didn't I? I didn't say when. I figured it up and I have missed it 21%. I failed by 21% of doing so. I thought I might come out with 1,200 pounds, a minimum, and I thought 1,400 pounds was awfully small, because I have been reading about the ton litters all of the time, but I found out that it wasn't a very easy task to reach even the minimum. I noticed in the paper the other day that the champion in hog raising, or something like that, an Iowa man, produced over 200 pounds more pork per sow than I did. He saved more pigs in the litter and had an advantage that way. His hogs weighed over 1800 pounds, averaging 240 pounds per head. My hogs this year averaged 216 pounds. Big Type — Not Breed, !* Deciding Factor You might be interested to know, I don't advocate breed, but I think Mr. Waggener took it for granted that I was breeding big type. I had 12 sows this year and. bred them to a boar of similar type. These sows were weighed when they were one year old, and just at farrowing they averaged right at BOO pounds. I think a spring gilt when she is heavy with pigs, should weigh right at 500 when she is 12 months old. That might sound a little heavy. These 12 sows farrowed 135 pigs, an average of 11 and one-third pigs per sow. The hog raisers who used to think that Poland Chinas only get twins and triplets have to change their mind, because they will get a big litter. I saved only 88 of these i35, which wasn't very good, but the first two sows farrowed the 18th of February, and if any of you remember that night, it was 7 below zero with a bard wind. The otber nine sows farrowed — nine the last of February and 7 the first part of March. The average birth was the 6th or 7th of March. </seg>
            <seg id="p613">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATI Used Individual Houses - These pigs were farrowed, of course, in individual houses. I wanted to start, them in right. Long ago I stopped using my big hog house. I. haven't used it for 5 or 6 years. The only thing I use it for is the sleeping 'quarters for my larger hogs, I am a strong advocator for sanitation for hogs. I have been planting an early variety of sweet corn, and I can hog that down in September, get it plowed the firsti of October, and put it in rye then the next spring, and have this rye pasture for March and April pasture for my pigs. Then the first of May I plow that ground and put it in sweet clover and in the fall again I hog it. down. • ! This year my pigs were weighed up the 6th or 7th of September when they were 180 days old. The 88 pigs weighed 18,900 pounds. On the last day of September or the first day of October, I trucked 66 of these 88 hogs to Omaha. They brought $11.25 and averaged $235. The 22 glits I still have. I am not going to hold my head down because prices are low. I think if we would all do it, we would miss out. We have got to get our hogs ready early. We can't hold our hogs 8, 9, 10 or 12 months, when they can be ready by 6. These 22 sows are all bred for an early farrow, and tomorrow or the next day they will average 10 months of age, and I would guess them to average 390 pounds. I don't know if I should take up any more time Mr. Waggener, I didn't outline much to talk from, so if there are any questions, I would soner answer the questions and give the time to someone else.

MR. K. Z. RUSSELL: Mr. Chairman and Ladies and Gentlemen: I don't believe it is necessary for me to say that it gives me a real honest-to-goodness pleasure to Ret before an honest-to-goodness bunch of Nebraska hog - men again. My mind this morning is just a little hit in a remininscent mood and I am going to take a minute or two minutes to say some - thing of that kind. I don't know if it was 25 or 26 years ago that the Nebraska Swine Breeders Association met here in this little old brick building, which was the first meeting of any bunch of livestock men hel'l at the State Farm. Now that seems not so awfully long ago to some of you, and a good while to others. I was talking to the Dean the other day, and we did not know whether it was 25 or 26 years ago, but it was the first meeting of livestock men in this country. We were criticized severly for having it away out in the country. There were no street cars or busses running out here, and they came in wagons and hauled them from 27th and Holdregn. The subject assigned to me is an old worn one, yet one of the most important in swine production. We cannot expect to produce a profitable bunch of pigs if the right kind of sow has not been selected and the right kind of management methods followed especially during the gestation and suckling periods. </seg>
            <seg id="p615">NEBRASKA ■ IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATI Select Gilti Carefully The question of whether or not old sows or young sows should be used will not be given consideration further than to say that we believe a sow that has proven a tried breeder and a good mother should not be discarded as long as her usefulness lasts. Naturally gilts must be selected to take the place of discarded old sows in the herd. We believe inj the old adage, "like begets like" consequently we would select gilts from sows that have given satisfactory results and whose general type and conformation suits us best. We believe that a gilt should be selected from not 'only a good sized litter but from a line of sows that have shown satisfactory production along this line. The gilts should have plenty of room which includes length and depth. As a gilt she should be somewhat more "leggy" than we would expect in an aged sow. For as she grows older she will build down and her legs as a gilt should be of sufficient length to prevent her udder dragging the ground when she becomes an aged sow.

Dispostion is one of the most important factors in the brood sow. It is sometimes extremely important that the herdsman be present at farrowing time and permitted to go into the pen and attend to such duties as are necessary without molesting the sow. So among other things we would wish to select our gilts from a sow that has a proven quiet disposition. The age at which gilts are bred to produce their first litter is a question to some extent but we are of the opinion that she should </seg>
            <seg id="p616">REPORT OF XKBKASKA STATK BiiARIi UV AQRICCLTL'RK be at least 8 months of age before being bred. This would make her about a year old when she farrows her first litter. From the time she is weaned until she is bred she should be given such feeds as are best to promote growth, develop her bone and muscle, at the same time put on enough flesh to have her in good condition but not fat at the time she is bred. It is always advisable to have hogs on pasture when it is available. ExercUe for the Bred Sow U Important Exercise during the gestation period is probably one of the most important matters in conditioning a brood sow. It is far better that the sow take this excercise voluntarily or in order to get her feed than to force her to take it. A splendid way to feed the grain rat.on is in the corn stalk field. This may be done by leaving part ■ of the c-orn in the field at husking time and by scattering either ear corn or shelled corn thinly throughout the field. In this way a sow will not get too much corn and will take plenty of excercise in getting what she does. During the past three years the following plan has been followed at the U. S. Experiment Farm at Beltsville, Maryland with splendid success. When the sows are bred they are placed in a stalk field in which a self-feeder containing 60 per cent tankage and a rack with good bright alfalfa hay so they would eat all of these two kinds of feed they desired at any time. In addition there was a self-feeder containing a simple mineral mixture and an automatic hog waterer These sows were fed two pounds of middlings per head per day and about a two per cent ration of shelled corn. In other words if the average weight of the sows was 400 pounds the average feeding of shelled corn was 8 pounds per head per day. Enough corn to last the sows 6 or 7 days was scattered thinly with a scoop shovel over an area of about 10 acres. One might easily think that the sows would eat an excess amount of tankage under this system, but such was not the case. The records show that the consumption of tankage was about 13% of the total feed consumption, which looks about right Sows would naturally eat more protein feeds during gestation than would hogs being fattened for market. Sanitation Should Be Followed At Farrowing Time From 70 to 80 head of sows were carried in the one field in this manner, and were brought through to farrowing time in very good condit.on. We follow the practise of leaving the sows in the field until about 3 days before they are due to farrow. At farrowing time the so-called McLean County System of Sanitation is recommended. This briefly is to thoroughly clean the farrowing pen and scrub thoroughly </seg>
            <seg id="p617">NEBRASKA! IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATII with hot water and lye. Bed well with clean wheat or rye straw. Before -placing the sow in the pen her sides and udder should be thoroughly cleaned by scrubbing with soap and water. This is for the purpose of removing all filth and dirt which may be infected with worm eggs. In this way the pig is born under quite sanitary conditions and is not required to swallow worm eggs* when he begins to nurse, which may easily be the case if the sow is put into a farrowing pen covered with mud from the hog lot An attendant should be at hand at farrowing time. When the pigs arrive they should be thoroughly dried and if the weather is cold they should be placed in a good comfortable place before being given to the sow to nurse. We believe it advisable to clip the teeth at this time. Care should be given in this operation to not injure the jaw bone. It is best to clip them about half way between the jaw bone to the joint. This can easily be done with a small side cutting pliers. If the litters are individually marked it should also be done at this time. After the sow has farrowed the pigs should be placed with her to nurse but if she is at all cross or irritable they should be removed after nursing and again placed with her about 2 hours later. This practice should be repeated as long as it is necessary. The farrowing pen should be roomy enough to permit the bow to walk around in comfort and be not less than 7x7 feet. A guard rail should be placed around the sides of the pen about 10 inches from the floor and extending about 8. inches from the sides. A 2x4 can best be used for this purpose which permits a 4 inch space between the guard rail and the sides of the pen. ■■'■ I Don't Feed the Sow too Heavily at First If any invariable rule were laid down it would be that during the first 24 hours after farrowing the sow should be given no food' whatever but plenty of luke warm water at frequent intervals. After this period feeding should begin first by giving a rather thin slop of shorts and middlings and gradually increasing in quantity and quality and adding some shelled corn until she is on full feed, which will be from 1 to 2 weeks after farrowing, depending on the size of the litter and the milking qualities of the sow. During this period the litter should be carefully watched before each feeding for white scours. If any of the pigs show signs of this trouble discontinue the slop and give the sow small" quantities of oats scattered thinly on the floor. Prepare lime water by disolving a piece of rock lime about the size of a base ball in a gallon of water. After it settles drain off the water and give it to the sow to drink. Also bathe the sow's udder and teats with some of the lime water. The pigs which are scouring should be given 5 </seg>

When the pigs are from 4 or 5 to 10 or 12 days old they must be watched for the appearance of "thumps". This trouble is caused by overfeeding and lack of excercise. The fattest and best pigs in the litter are the ones to watch. We know of no cure, once a pig 13 affected, but plenty of excercise will prevent the trouble. If the little fellows are confined to their farrowing pen and become very fat, force quite violent excercise in some manner. Driving them around the pen or in the alleyway of a farrowing house until they become tired, 3 or 4 times a day will usually cause the trouble to disappear. It is best to remove the sow and litter from the farrowing pen to some lot or pasture when the pigs are a week to ten days old. As soon as the sow is on full feed we follow the practice of placing her in a lot where there is a self-feeder containing shelled corn, tankage and shorts permitting her to eat any of these feeds at any time she desires. Mineral mixture is also always available. Self-Feed the Sows and Littert We carried on three years of experimental w.ork on the question of self-feeding as against hand feeding sows and litters during the suckling period at the U. S. Experiment Farm, Beltsville, Maryland, and found that at weaning time both the sows and litters in the self fed lots were in better condition thas those in the hand fed lots and further there was a saving of feed by self feeding. We do not know how many sows and litters may be placed on one self feeder but some 2 or 3 years ago we put 20 sows and pigs in about a 4 acre field of alfalfa pasture with one self feeder with very satisfactory results. These pigs were observed quite closely during the time and we believe that easily 5 more sows and litters could have been on the same feeder. The size of the feeder in this lot was 6 feet long, 5 feet in width and contained 3 compartments. One can readily see that this system of feeding saves a great amount of labor. All that is necessary is to keep the feeder supplied with feed and for the sows to have access to an automatic hog waterer Another advantage we found with the self feeding system was that more than twice as many sows in the self fed lot could be bred from 1 to 2 weeks before the pigs were weaned than in the hand fed lots. This is quite an advantage where two litters a year are bred. Another noticeable advantage was the weaning of the pigs. When the piga are to be weaned, our plan is to build a fence around the self feeder leaving creeps at two or three of the corners which would permit the pigs to get such feeds as they desired, but cutting the feeds off </seg>

Naturally the sows getting no feed except pasture the flow of milk would stop within a few days, generally 3 to 4 days; When the sows are transferred from the lot the pigs were left on the same' self feeder for any way two to three weeks. If they are to be fattened for market they may be left in the same lot. MR. LOEFFEL, Chairman: Perhaps some of you have some questions you would like to ask Mr. Russell. Are there any questions? . .• QUESTION: I would like to know what he uses in the self - feeder while the sows are suckling the pigs.

I don't have the figures with me but 1 will be glad to send you the bulletin on this if you will write to me. If any of you want to get this bulletin write to the U. S. D. A. or me. QUESTION: How old are the pigs when you wean them? 1/ ■ ■ ANSWER: We usually wean them at 10 weeks. I believe that we should take every advantage we can of the natural feed we have for pigs, and that -is the mother's milk. We follow the practice of never weaning at less than 10 weeks unless under some extraordinary condition. If ij had my own way, I would let the old sow wean them. QUESTION: I would like to ask him how about using ground wheat in place" of shorts? • ANSWER: When the price is satisfactory. It will take tho place o.E corn and some of your protein feeds too. Fine. It is all right. QUESTION: At what age do you vaccinate? ANSWER: That is a question that I cannot answer MR. LOEFFEL, Chairman: The next thing on the program is country buying. Last Octob'er we had a hog feeder's meeting at this institution. We had a question box and I think we had more questions on the advisability of country buying.

            <seg id="p621">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATU seen the error of their way and patronize the open market regardless of the few cents that is being offered by the direct' buyer in the country. After giving this matter serious consideration and the figures that I have had to deal with during the year 1926 and 1927 has brought to my attention the vast difference in the price of hogs. On a given number of hogs that we have shipped from our yards •we find a differ - " ence in some $7000 when we compare the price received" in 1926 with the price received in 1927. ! On a given number of hogs and, I dare say our experience is no different than the average feeder, when the balance of the' account was made we found that it took practically all of the profit made on the hogs to balance the steer loss. In 1927 it took practically all of the steer profit to off-set the hog loss and I am wondering; if the direct buying of hogs in the country has not had something to do with this difference. "j . How Direct Buying Got Started I appreciate that the export market has not been as flush in 1927 as it was in 1926 and that supplies have accumulated in cold storage to a larger extfent in 1927 than 1926, but surely it was not the differ r ence in the price that the. packer or retailer receive for the manufac - tured product in comparing the net cost between the two years men - tioned. It is a wonderful system .that has been worked out where they can let you make a small profit on one end of the feeding business and sustain a loss on the other end one year and the reverse the next so the man that made the remark that a live- stock feeder must be .an optimist is' surely true, for we find the average live stock feeder always hopeful and optomistic as to what the market is going to be just a few weeks hence or over the next feeding year period and as these condi - tions continue SI am of the opinion that it will take more than a war finance committee' to supply the needed stimulant to keep the average livestock feeder optomistic, and I am beginning to look with suspicion at any new plan that is submitted with reference to improving the con - ditions of the live stock farmer and feeder from the fact that usually we find a joker in the bill that takes all the joy out of having the bill passed by Congress for when it gets into actual operation the laws of this nature are shown to be born of either political parents or the designing interest of the few and not the producers. For instance a few .years agOia cry went up in Washington that the terminal markets were controlled and owned; by the packers so a law was passed com - pelling the packer to dispose of all of his interest in the terminal mar - kets and what 1 happens? As soon as he finds a buyer for his interest in the terminal markets we find small concentrating yards springing up all over the hog belt and I am just wondering what great benefit the producer has derived from having the packer dispose of his ter - minal yard interest.

Concentration Points Cost Money We must realize and appreciate that he maintain individual con - centrating points over the hog belt entail a considerable expense that must be borne by the producer and the packer and all of the incidental expenses incurred in the purchase and manufacturing of the product is added to the cost of the finished product and the price made on that basis. The problem that confronts each and every producer of live stock must he answered by himself if he is to compete with the packing interest in attempting to destroy the competitive market centers. It is plain to be seen that by dividing the territory the packer has every ad - vantage in that the farmer always tries to take advantage of the' extra few cents that is being offered him rather than look to what the future may have in store which he knows to be wrong and detrimental to his own interest. But human nature appears to be the same and the world over in that we fall for a few dollars to relieve our immediate condi - tions and let the future take care of itself always hopeful that we will be in better shape the next time we have something to offer for sale and if Mr. Packer has need for three-thousand hogs and he has advice from the concentrating points that they have rounded up twenty-five hundred you can well appreciate that he is a bear on the market, not a bull. Country Buying Limits Competition Consequently the only competitors that we have on the livestock is the few independent buyers that are not in a position to handle large volume and this, of course, gives them an opportunity to take advantage of the condition at the expense of the producer and, of course, the plan is now being used by the packer in purchasing these hogs based on the price that the terminal market is offering the day purchase is made and of course by holding out to the buyer that they can eliminate a certain terminal charge by selling direct, but he fails to tell you that if he can buy his supply of hogs in the country that he will not be on the terminal market to help make the market that he is offering you. This, of course, means that it will permit them to lower the terminal market to more than offset the added cost of maintaining the concen- </seg>

Should competition be entirely eliminated there can be only one answer, you will have only one buyer with no competition and you will be compelled to take the price offered or go into the sausage business yourself, so every producer should see that his livestock is sold on the' open market on a competitive basis and refuse to sell tjo the direct packer buyer. As a matter of interest to. you I find that points for hog shipments in Nebraska are now located at [Central City,; Valley, Fremont, Columbus, Grand Island, Hastings, Kearney, Lexington, North Platte, Sidney, Lincoln, Aurora, Broken Bow, Alliance, Superior and McCook and I can appreciate that when, all of these buyers cooperating with the local shipper covering the entire statcj of Nebraska that it gives the packer a wonderful op - portunity to depress prices on the open market so if it is wrong for the packer to own a part interest in the terminal market why should it not be wrong for him to own the concentrating points at the above named points, j At the terminal market he is in competition ■with att outside independent points.. At the concentrating points he has no competition and 'if this condition is allowed to continue I feel that the live stock interests will suffer the greatest handicap in the history of the business. I Overhead Cost at Terminal Markete is Too High I am wondering if the over-head cost of the selling and terminal market expense has not also had something to do with the producer being willing to sell direct to Mr. Packer as we all know the shipping expense on a jcarload of live stock within the last ten years has in - creased approximately eighty per cent. This would include freight, terminal year iexpenses and the commission for selling same and I have felt for some time that certain expenses incurred at the terminal yards and live stock; commissions should be reduced along with other reduc - tions that have been made in all lines and I am wondering if the'in - terest that is now being effected the same as the live stock producer would not be ;benefitted if they would come out and help combat the enemy and not leave the entire job to the producer alone. If they are really in. earnest about the matter of keeping open the competitive market f ot the benefit of all concerned I am sure it would be a step in the right direction to have them formulate a plan along these lines in order "that they might bold out to the producer some inducement for the effort that he puts forth in agreeing to sell on the open market at all times.

In the first place, the sellers are scattered, not organized and in many instances of limited means while the buyers are few, strongly concentrated, located at the leading live stock maik - ets of the country and naturally in close touch with the market con - ditions of the world and with the best experts that money can ob - tain for advice and assistance in the purchase. In the second place, the subject matter of the transaction is perishable. That is, after the animals are fattened and primed for the market, they must be marketed without any great delay, regard - less of market conditions. In the third place, the so-called "Big Pack - ers" buy probably seventy-five per cent of the animals sold in ten of the leading price-setting markets of this country, for interstate slaughter, and necessarily make the market, except only in so far as the small packers offer competition. These admitted facts, even in the open and competitive markets, give to the packer a very decided advantage over the producers and this situation calls for very serious consideration of the move to do away with the open and competitive markets and install in lieu there - of a sysfen of marketing and does away with competition altogether, with all governmental regulation and which gives the buyer the arbi - trary power to determine the grade and weight of the animal and to fix the price. So it is that the unorganized shipper, dealing with highly organized marketing agencies, is sorely in need ol some sort ot gov - ernmental supervision that will guarantee him fair play. Paclcen Want System of Direct Buying It is idle to suggest that the packers intend to maintain both sys - tems of marketing, because the signs point inevitably to the fact the private system of marketing is now being generally installed by them in this country. The stage is set, and with the building of greater concentrating points thruout the hog producing section of this country and receiving pens at their large packing plants, all to escape com - petition and governmental regulations. Even a blind man can see what is going on. There is no reason why anyone should be fooled on this question. The great growth of private buying within the last two years definitely settles that question. There is no middle ground in this matter. This country is entitled to the best system of marketing to bo had and is also entitled to have this question permanently set - tled and at the same time get rid of this agitation, which does no one any good. If the middle men should go and this system of private buying is sound, then I say let it be installed and close the present pub - lic markets, with good feeling all around. </seg>
            <seg id="p625">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATIC So in this matter, the system of private buying cannot last per - manently because it has no competition, no governmental regulation and the buyer is given the arbitary power to determine the grade and the weight, and to fix the price. No buyer of any staple article and particularly a necessity of life, should be given such great and arbi - trary power and I am wondering if there is no friend of the packers with sufficient influence to cause them to see the very serious mis - take they are making and I am hoping that this important matter will be settled in a way that is justly fair to the producer, the packer and the ultimate consumer. The producer needs the packer, the packer needs the producer and the ultimate consumer needs them both and I would appreciate having matters of this kind settled on the merits of the case rather than spend time, effort and money in petitioning Con - gress to pass a law to compel some one to do something that they should do in the interest of all concerned. I thank you. MR. LOEFFEL, Chairman: Our next speaker on this intensely interesting subject is Mr. W. B. Tagg, Ex-President of the Livestock Exchange at South Omaha. He will tell you how the commission men feel about this 1 matter. THE TRUTH ABOUT COUNTRY BUYING —AS THE MARKET SEES IT— MR TAGG: Mr Hildebrand made one remark at the beginning of his speech which will apply very properly to what is going to follow. My few remarks will be very brief indeed. . I would like to explain the at - titude of our people on this question in the very few moments that I am going to take. Direct Buying it a Producers Problem This is not a commission man's problem, except to a very minor ■degree, but it is the producer's problem. After the excellent treatise .you have heard on that question by Mr. Hildebrand, a practical stock - man and breeder of years of experience, there is not much that I can add except to o. k. most of the things he said, and you all can realize the one that I am not so heartily in sympathy with. I think we axe all more or less human, more or less selfish. We all of us make mis - takes in a good many things we do, but I don't believe the producers </seg>
            <seg id="p626">KKI'iiKT UK MCHRASKA STATK HOARD OF AORICl'LTURB or farmers of this country ever go very far wrong on their solatfon of any question, when they thoroughly understand the merits' of the problem, and if all the producers thruout this territory understand the conditions and the effect of this direct buying as well as Mr. Hildebrand does, you will get the right solution to it and you will get it very soon, because the question is a growing one. The Increase in Direct Buying Has Lowered the Price of Hogs Two years ago, practically 24 per cent of the hogs in this country ware sold direct to six hundred leading packing houses in the United States, according to government figures. The last figures available showed 36 per cent for the year ending June 1927. That means that the packer is already buying one-third, or a little over a third, of his hogs direct from the country, on which there is no competition what - ever at the market. Now if you are running a packing house, it is necessary that you have a supply of raw material every day, and if you have one-third of your day's needs in your pocket when you start out in the morning, you are in a pretty comfortable frame of mind and r cannot imagine that you would want to be bullish on the market that day. The direct buying has had but one effect on value and that is a depressing one. The conditions that 1 think show the best explan - ation of the effect of the direct buying are the keeping of the prices established at the competitive markets, at which points one-third of the buying power has been removed. With receipts for the eleven months of this year at the twenty leading markets showing an increase of around one per cent, the prices of hogs averaging 37 percent less or an average of $8.12 for December 1926 at Omaha against $11.26 for December 1926. That cannot all be attributed to direct buying. No one can estimate how much of it is, but it is a cinch that a good deal of it is due to that particular cause. Some few weeks ago, we were invited at the Omaha market to send a representative here to discuss this question, and 1 was selected one afternoon for the job. The next day a matter came up that made it impossible for me to attend. An - other speaker was arranged for and yesterday afternoon an objection was made to this gentleman appearing on this program. He is a man that has had years of experience in all angles, of this question and I think is probably one of the best posted men in the country, because he has ma ,|p „ deep study of it. To comply with the requorti his ap - pearance was cancelled, and I was advised at .3 o'clock yesterday that I was picked to come down here today, sn if I ramble a little bit in rny remarks it will be because I have not given it sufficient study. I had several points to bring out but Mr. Hildebrand has covered most of them, «o it is not necessary to repeat. There are a few points, however, that thinking men should take into consideration. I give the packer* credit for being honest, human, ambitious and necessary. 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p627">XKHUASKA I.UI'KnVICh LIVKSTOCK mtlOKI iKIW ASSOCIAT1 don't think he is any more honest than any one of us. He is a man whose word is absolutely good in all of his business transactions, but they are guided by the' same principle, the same economic principles that every successful business man is, and that is to buy their manu - factured products as cheap as they can and sell them as high as they can consistently. Now when you allow the packer to take away aiiy of the selling arguments that your agent, the commission man, has, you are weak - ening his hand. At the market the commission man is an employer of the' producer and the agent of the producer. He receives his pay entirely from the producer and is working for his interest. Each time you sell a load of hogs to the packer direct you remove that much of the buying competition from the market. Buying power is what makes thet market. As I said before, the packer is doing business like any successful business man should. This direct buying would be a very fine plan it he could get away with it, but there is only one class of people that can stop him from doing it, and. that is the producer himself. If the producers of this country want to market their livestock direct, that is their privilege and we have no fault to find with them. Division of Territory Prevents Competition With the elimination ot the public market you can expect a division of the territory with one buyer for your product. I say you can expect the division of the territory because that is what happen - ed at most all of the points where packers are buying in the country. I will venture to say that 75 per cent of the places where packer buy - ers operate in the country there is no competition now, and as com - petition is the life of trade, there should be more competition, as the lack of competition has but one effect, and that is to depress prices. The late J. 0. Armour, head of one of the greatest packing companies in the country, made the statement under oath in the Mistletoe Case ' that the private system of marketing was economically unsound and should not be installed generally. He recognized what it would mean in the long run. I think he was a victim of circumstance in that he had to support it to a certain extent but he knew that the system was not sound and would not be a good system .to continue indefinitely and he thought it would gradually die out. Now it hasn't decreased be-, cause the packers realize that in order to remove competition from the markets, the best method they can find is the system of direct buy - ing. It seems rather odd too that the beginning of the decline of the hog prices last fall started the first day of the meeting of the Insti - tute of American Meat Packers in Chicago. I don't think there was any connection, I don't mean that exactly, but it does seem rather pe - culiar that at the first day of the meeting the decline of the hog market started and it has been going along pretty well ever since.

            <seg id="p630">HKJ'MHT of XKiiilASKA STATIC IliMHU oF AUKIUUl/riTRE One might feel that the possibilities of the territory surround - ing these markets have been realized. I think there is no question but what the possibilities of Nebraska, especially as a livestock pro - ducing region, have thoroughly come up to the expectation of the pionoer packers who planned the exi.stance of their packing house at thcie larger markets. But some of the other sections of the country have not developed in the same way, .or according to the same ex - pectations. Whereas in 1880 and 18!)0 when that country south of us m\&lt;\ throughout this region was making its first great development of livi-.-UK-k production Kansas and Missouri promises to become as much of a country for hog growing as did Nebraska and Iowa, and much more than did the Dakotas and Minnesota. Today we find that those more southern states have actually gone backward in the pro - duction of hogs, so that in 1920 Kansas and Missouri had only 88 per cent of the hogs that they had in 1880, and in 1927 only 78 per cent of the hogs that they had in 1910. Furthermore, the period since the war has been characterized by the very remarkable devel - opment of Minnesota and the two Dakotas. Kantai City and East St. Loui. do not Receive Enough Hog. I am talking about hog production almost entirely, because hog production is the only thing that is affected in volume by country buying, with the exception of veal calves in a territory outside of the district in which you gentlemen operate. There is direct marketing of cattle from districts east of Chicago, that is direct shipment to the eastern markets, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Jersey City, New York, and so on. There is some direct marketing in those sections but when I speak today I am referring almost entirely to hogs, unless I qualify it othprwisp. There are two markets on which the packers placed their bets by the erection of large plants which have failed to live up to their expections. If the packers were to operate their plants at Kansas City and East St. Louis with the hogs that come to the public market only, Kansas City packing houses could be operated only at about one - third of their capacity, and the St. Louis houses only at about 40 per cent of their capacity. When one realizes that at such plants as Armour's at Kansas City, it costs around $1.25 to kill a hog when we are operating at about 50 per cent capacity, and only 60 cents when we are operating at 90 to 95 per cent, a difference of 20 to 30 cents per hundred weight, you can see what a problem is in - troduced. You can also see why Kansas City has increasingly drawn on Nebraska territory for hog supplies. It is evident that the com - petition of the Kansas City market has correspondingly been stronger and stronger against the Omaha market in drawing on Nebraska live - stock—more especially Nebraska hogs but to a certain extent fat cattle. </seg>
            <seg id="p631">■ NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATIC We had to come to Nebraska from Kansas City and assume greater freight charges on our hogs resulting from the greater distance from producer to market,, because, many times, it was cheaper to accept greater freight charges than to operate under the greater slaughtering cost. Hogs are Bought Direct to Satisfy These Markets Some of you will undoubtedly ask, why not buy those hogs on the Omaha or Sioux City public markets and ship them down to Kansas City? I do not care how strongly Mr. Hildebrand and Mr. TagK may defend market charges, in fact from their standpoint there is .little doubt but what they are reasonable, their multiplication by the intervention of market services three or four times between the farm and the packer makes such a practice almost prohibitive. Every time hogs are loaded and unloaded, handled or sorted, fed ami watered, it costs money— sufficient sums, when repeated, to put the products' of such hogs under a tremendous price handicap when they entor the wholesale meat trade. All of you are familiar with the amount of the market charges on carloads of livestock. You know when they are applied once that they probably result in a satisfactory increase in returns to the farmer through the services rendered. However, the intervention of such charges a second, third, or fourth time adds very little, if anything to the value of the animals handled and places a tax on the ultimate buyer through the forced increase in the prices he must pay. In fact, it would be much cheaper for us to buy and slaughter the hogs at Omaha or Sioux City and ship the product southward. Some of you may ask us why we do not follow that practice? The answer is simple. Each of the packers has a plant at Kansas City, a plant with tremendous investments and operating with tre - mendous overhead. Such plants can only yield a profit when they are operating at a reasonable percentage of their capacity. It would be impossible on the basis of plants of the size of those at Omaha and Sioux City to offset the losses due to operation at a small fraction of Omaha and Sioux City even if the northern plants were operated daily at a hundred per cent capacity. The shortage of production in sur - ounding territory applies equally to St. Louis and Kansas City. In fact they are both in grave danger of changing from major slaughtering points for hogs to mere distributing points for their products. As far as agricultural .manufactures are concerned, both cities are changing from producers to brokers. However, it will take too much time to present all the data covering this situation, and I shall devote no further discussion to it, except to point out that packers laid out their plants according to a scheme of livestock slaughtering and of a con - centration of livestock production, in line with what they felt would be the developmental possibilities of the country. The possibilities </seg>

N'ot only is it a question of plant supply, however, but it is a question of furnishing the neres-ary pork products and provisions for the peo - pli- who live in the South. Thi? is a factor i:: increasing the costs All of you know that the freight rates of t h 1 .- country were based on a westward to eastward ■ '•'' movement. You know that the cost of the movement of any products across th"&lt;e channel? of traffic is at least 10 per cent greater than moving them through the regular channels. Yet the discrepancy be - tween the arrangement of the packer's slaughtering plants as originally planned and th. modern changes in hog production are almost daily forcing increasing int&lt;n&gt;iediary charges between the producer and con - sumer. Yet the people of these southwestern districts must bo fed (1-spitp the shortage of their hog production. Since the use of the established marketing system was prohibitive when southern purchasing power was considered, it was necessary to develop some other method. Country purchase (if hogs and direct shipment to the plants short of supplies seemed to be the only method of overcoming the multiplication of these public market charges and placing the hog products at such high prices to all of you that if your dressed hog carcasses cost 25c a hun - dredweight more than your competitor's you cannot sell profitably in competition with them. To consider one factor only the north to south movement on pork products as compared to the east to -west movement adds five cents a hundredweight on dressed pork. It is only natural then that we should have sought some method whereby we could eliminate some of these intermediary charges. It was the increase in these charges for services that made it essential for the packers to seek some other method of securing their hogs, especially in times of shortage. I doubt very much, though, if the country buying movement would have gained any great force, if it had not been for the rapid increase in the business of the socalled 'interior" packers located away from the public markets in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The rapid growth and expansion of the business of these packers suggested that they had discovered some com - petitive advantage, and it was only when the packers at. the public markets discovered that these "interior" packers were able to pay the producer more for live hogs and at the same time have cheaper products, through country buying, that the secret of their success dis - closed. The elimination of the intermediary charges on hogs market- • ing was the factor enabling them to expand their business on a sound economic basis. </seg>
            <seg id="p633">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATE • "Interior" Packer* Force Big Packers to Buy Direct Some of the statements made by the preceding speakers were quite ■ misleading. Mr. Hildebrand pointed out that seventy-five per cent of the hogs, bought at public markets were purchased by the big packers. I do not know whether this statement is true or not, but it means little. About fifty-two to fifty-five per cent of the hogs killed under federal inspection in the United States are killed by these four packers. Furthermore, this is only forty per cent of the total hog slaughter of the country. When federal inspection was first established, the big packers killed about sixty-five per cent of the hogs so slaughtered. The percentage dropped to about fifty-five at the opening of the war, in - creased to sixty-three during the war and has dropped almost to fifty per cent since. Some of you may wonder as to the economic factor un - derlying this change. The fundamental cause lies in the fact that the products savings on hogs are |not sufficient to offset the additional overhead costs of large plants. In the case of hogs this averages only 3.4 per cent, but in the case of sheep it approaches 20 per cent and in the case of cattle 13 per cent. I think that these percentages show quite definitely why the big packers hold their position in cattle and sheep slaughter, but are losing ground somewhat in hog slaughter. It has therefore, been possible for small packers to operate very successfully in competition with the large packers on hog slaughter because the large packers had no advantage in efficiency over them. There have been at least three competitive factors inside the in - dustry, that have led to the increase in country buying on the part of the large packers. I have already referred to the interior packers. Up to the time of the world war they were not a particularly important factor competitively. They killed about 57 Dor cent of federallv in - spected slaughter. Following the- post-war deflation it was found that their percentage had increased to 10, while by 1926 they were doing 15 per cent of federally inspected slaughter. In a period of five ' years based on their proportion of the trade they had increased their business by 50 per cent. Pacific Coait and Eaitern Direct Buyers Furnish Further Competition Another factor that has had a very decided effect in forcing the packer to the country has been the growth of the Pacific Coast packers. Since 1910 hog production on the Pacific Coast has fallen off about 22 per cent, and the Pacific Coast packers have come fur - ther and further into the central West in order to secure their supplies. While they are occasionally found in the Kansas City and Omaha markets, they are constantly represented at such markets as Wichita, Denver, Fort Worth, Amarillo, Ogden, etc., and are regularly found buying in the country in the territory surrounding these markets.

These eastern packers operate on a straight turnover basis, and do not assume the responsibility of putting pork and provisions into storage. They sell their fresh cuts immediately, and dispose of their bellies, green hams, etc.. through brokers or other agencies so as to get a complete turn - over on practically all their products within ten days to three weeks viz the usual rate for the fresh meat trade. They have been able to develop a big enough business in their own markets, so that they can operate a profitable manufacturing business without taking on the responsibility of provision storage and distribution. They operate on the basis of the current market and have no handicap of the carrying charges mvolved in the holding of products three to five months af J the hogs are bought. They have been able to increase their business on the New York, Philadelphia, and other eastern markets, because of the demand for ,a,tern killed pork. They can usually secure from one to four cents per pound premium on eastern killed fresh pork as br!f ar von t Mr frigerated u POrk - Y ° U ne6d " Ot teke my WOrd on this ' ' f } .°" W1 " famine the quotations in the meat trade journals you In £ nd , that , ther V S never Iess than a cent ""Bin between eastern and western dressed pork. Since the freight rates on live hogs and dressed products are approximately equalized between the West and New Wk, it is possible for the eastern packers consistently to" pay fifteen to twenty-five cents per hundredweight more for the type of ho KS they can use, than can the large packers, because of the premium they receive for the bloom on their pork and the elimination of the storage sen-ice. This is the reason why the order buyers or eastern packers make the hog market. You have heard many people com - plain that the big packers do not come out early and bid in strong competition with them. There is no economic basis on which they can do so because of the competitive advantages I have just pointed out and the only way in which the big packers could secure any com - petitive advantage over them would be through one of the old-fashioned cut-throat price-cutting wars which neither the government nor anyone rl.=e would tolerate. Experience has shown that this sort of a things </seg>
            <seg id="p635">NEBRASKA IMl'liUVlCl) UVKSTOCK KREEDEUS 1 ASSOCIATIC not only uneconomical, but never solves any business problem, it sim - ply postpones its solution. The competition of these three types of small packers are the principal factors which have sent the big packers to the country. The effect has been to make less and less hogs available -on the* public market for the packers that are located there. I can say frankly that ■ the big packers have not wanted to go to the country. But they have been forced to go out there and purchase just the same as the off - market, packers do. They would much prefer to receive hogs at the public market adjacent to their own plants, but when the hogs do not come there, the only thing left for the packer to do is to go out after them. It is the very same thing which you or anyone would do, and is the only way in which you could' keep your business operating-. Direct Buying Hai Not Affected Price ■ Having discussed the two factors which have been fundamental from an economic standpoint, in bringing about direct marketing— viz., the change in the areas of production and the increase competition from off-market packers, I would like to turn to some of the remarks of the other speakers. First of all, it has been insinuated that the drop in hog prices during 1927 was the result of direct marketing. In response I should like to ask you gentlemen a few questions. Do you think that if more hogs had been sold through the public markets this last year that smoked regular hams would have not dropped 6 1-2 cents per pound, or twenty-three per cent? Or, that smoked picnics would not ■ have dropped 3 1-2 cents per pound or twenty per cent; that smoked bacon would not have decreased 4 1-2 cents per pound or sixteen per cent; that fresh pork loins would not have declined 7 cents per pound or thirty-one per cent; fresh skinned shoulders, 5 1-2 cents per pound or thirty-three per cent; fresh Boston butts, 6 1-2 cents per pound or thirty-two per cent; and boiled hams, 11 cents per pound or thirty - six per cent? If you believe that by having bought these hogs through the public market you could have kept up the pWce of provisions, j Armour and Company will employ .you at double the salary of the presi - dent, the only requirement being that you. guarantee your results. The price of hogs has gone down because the price of products I has gone down. The average price of hogs has dropped about $3.50 per hundredweight during the last year, or some 28 per cent. The average price of products quoted above dropped 26 to 28 per cent. This does not take into account also the drop in lard which occurred just ahead of this period, in fact at the time of the Packers' Conven - tion to which Mr. Tagg so insinuatingly referred. It dropped almost three cents in a period of about eight weeks. </seg>
            <seg id="p636">RKPORT OF VKBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICt'LTURE Loss of Export Trade -Reduced Dressed Pork Prices These price depressions occurred because it was necessary to force our normal export into the domestic trade. The first half of 1927 our exports were some 30 per cent under the 1926 volume, and European production is at its peak of all time. Thus, the first eleven months of 1927 Germany marketed 37 per cent more hogs than she did in 1926. During the same period Denmark exported a third greater tonnage of bacon to England than she did in 192G, and 50 per cent more than in 1925. Whereas the average exportation of bacon to Eng - land up till 1925 usually ran from 2800 to 3500 metric tons weekly at the present time is running around 7200 to 7500 tons. Poland and Czechoslovakia have tremendously increased their export trade, while the new states of Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania have also become important factors. Within the last year you could buy almost all the brands of bacon except Danish in London at 11.8 cents a pound Ameri - can money. This is for bacon of a somewhat better quality than is produced in this country, and illustration of the American hog pro - ducer, but he is in clover compared to the Britisher. I had a letter from Mr. Sanders Spencer, the dean of British hog producers, and he tells me that never in history has their swine production had to face such terrific competition. Yet perhaps the condition is going to change soon. The per - centage of sows slaughtered in Germany from June to October was 20 per cent greater than in 1926, and there is no question but what there is a big liquidation in breeding herds in all European countries. As soon as this crop in Europe is out of the way, conditions should im - prove materially, and perhaps be reflected in this country by fall. We rather expected that we would get an upturn in the market some - time this spring, but as the new government report on fall farrowing shows an 11 per cent increase over 1926, it may be that the upward turn in the market will be delayed until fall also. I do not know how correct the government report is, but in ten previous predictions they have only once failed to indicate the correct trend. Perhaps even then they were correct on the trend of farrowing, which they pre - dicted as somewhat smaller, but actual marketings increased due to the slaughter of sows as a result of the bad corn crop of 1924. Most Country Bought Hogs go to Small Packers Mr. Tagg referred to the fact that one-third of the hogs in the country are marketed direct and that the packer has one-third of his daily supply in his pocket when he goes out to buy. This is a very misleading statement. Probably 27 or 28 per cent are in the hands of the people who do not operate on the public market at all. He stated that the percentage of directs was 24 in 1925. Much of the increase since that time has taken place in the smaller packers, especially the "interior" packers. We never had, and I doubt if we ever will have, one-third of our supply in sight when we go out to </seg>
            <seg id="p637">NEBRASKA lMPROVttn LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOC1ATK buy. But suppose that we did have one-third of our supply in sight or even a half, 1 do not care what percentage one chooses, each hog that we have bought reduces the supply just as much as it does the demand. It does not change the relation between supply and demand one bit am) there is no reason why the law should not operate just as it did' before. If you have one-half of your hogs on hand and must operate at 75 or 80 percent, it is just as hard to get the remainder as it would have been in the first place, because the supplies are proportionately smaller. You will find that the price level remains the same, and its entirely unaffected by direct buying. Direct Shipments do not Affect Price Perhaps the best way to prove this is to study the effect of country buying in direct competition, with specific markets. Let us take Omaha as the basic market, for there are no direct shipments of hogs, so far as I know, to Omaha. To Omaha prices add 36 cents, the freight rate on a double-deck car of hogs from Omaha to Chicago,' and add the other freights from other markets correspondingly, ex - cept for S.t. Louis add the difference between the St. Louis-New York rates and the Chicago-New York rates. Taking the price of all but - cher hogs over a period of five years, and using government figures comparing grade for grade, Omaha is about 2 cents under Chicago, St. Louis about 60 cents over Omaha, and Kansas City about 18 cents over Omaha. Yet Chicago has had about 8 per cent of directs during the last three years, St. Louis about 20 per cent and Kansas City about 29 per cent. St. Louis margins are somewhat greater than Kansas City, because St. Louis has such an enormously greater ship - ping demand, but if anyone were to draw any conclusions as to the relation between direct marketing and the price level at various mark - ets, he would have to say that the more the direct marketing, the greater the margin. This applies without exception, even when other markets such as St. Paul are included when St. Louis is eliminated. However, I do not believe that direct shipments have any effect on the price level either- upward or downward. If hogs are so short at a market as to require supplementing, direct marketing increases, and that is all there is to it. The packer is forced to go out and purchase because. the hogs are not there. You may suggest that we can get more hogs at any market by paying a higher price there, but no market - can stay out of line with others because its products cannot be sold in competition with the pro - ducts of other markets. Hence it is necessary to supplement such markets by country buying. Another criticism made by Mr. Tagg and Mr. Hildebrand is that there is only one buyer at country points. This, may be true in communities producing a very few hogs, but it is not </seg>
            <seg id="p638">REPORT OF XKHRASKA STATE HOARD OP AGRICULTURE! true where there is a large production. A study of the concentration points and local packing plants in Iowa by' Mr. Derrick of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, showed some 4 to 5 buyers in each com - munity. In many places there were six to seven buyers to whom the local shipper could sell. Always there was the competition which the seller had between the local buyer and shipping to the public market. Mr. Hildebrand has pointed out the apparent fact that the packer has gone to country buying in order to avoid regulation by the Packer and Stock Yard Administration. This is the kind of a criticism that sounds well but means nothing. There have been no difficulties be - tween thp Packer and Stock Yards Administration and the packers over trading, and the packers have no feeling whatsoever on the mat - ter. The Packer and Stock Yard Administration has placed no handi - caps on packer buying at the public market, and there is no handicap possible under present honest operation. Country buying has increased not because of regulation but because of lack of hogs in relation to the plant capacity at the public markets. Packers Prefer to Buy Hogs at the Public Market! In conclusion I wish to agree on one essential with Mr. Tagg. Direct marketing is not a packer's problem. It is not a commission man's problem. It is a problem of the individual producer. If he wants to sell his hogs on the public market, there is nothing to prevent him. If he feels that country buying is working to the disadvantage of the public market, let him ship there and support the public market. The big packer wants the hogs there. But every shipper must decide that question for himself, and if he decides against the public market, the packer must take the necessary measures to protect himself, that is, he must do so if he wants to preserve his plants and to prevent his competitors away from the markets from taking his hog business away from him. If you gentlemen feel that it is a menace to sell hogs from the country to Armour and Company and Swift and Company, and not a menace to sell them to Morrell, Hormel, Rath, Decker or other smaller packers, that is, of course, your privilege. But that is not sound economics, nor is it the basis on which American business institutions am founded. If it is a menace for one man to encroach upon the civil rights of others, it is a menace for a second to do the same thing. Similarly, if it is a menace to sell to the big packer in the country, it in also a menace to sell to the smaller. There has been a lot of confused thinking on this subject, but the situation is bound to de - velop along lines that are economically sound. ' In parting I wish only to say that if you ship your hogs direct to the public markets, we shall be very glad to buy them there, but if you do not, you must expect us to go buy the hogs where they are. r </seg>

NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS ASSOCIATION Lincoln, Nebraska January 3, 1928 Following a box luncheon in Room 203 at the Animal Husbandry Building on the College of Agriculture Campus, the annual business meeting of the Nebraska Improved Livestock Breeders Association was called to order by President Charles Graff at 12.50 p. m. The minutes of the 1927 meeting were read and approved. The treasurer's report, including a detailed account of expenses on each activity to date and comparisons with previous expenditures on similar projects for other years followed. An estimate of ex - penditures contingent to the winter meetings then in progress was also included. The report was accepted as read. The approval of this report was followed by a short discussion on the nature and source of the appropriations at present being used by the association and the purposes for which they had been expended in the past. President Graff then called for recommendations from those present as to what future activities should be undertaken by the association and what funds should be appropriated to the pro - motion of each. A general {discussion of the results and of the various projects sponsored by the association in the past followed. The de - sirability of the continuance of each was discussed in a general way but no definite action was taken. In the line of future [ activities Mr. Stewart suggested that the association award some additional prizes for club work at the State Fair and other fairs with jthe thought in mind that Boys and Girls Livestock Clubs could be best stimulated in this manner.

J don't know how you people feel about it but it seems to me that from year to year as we meet here during Agricultural meeting week, that the people get more and more out of these meetings. Our program from year to year varies a great deal. The boys always try to put up something of interest to the farmers and stockmen of Nebraska. \ esterday morning you remember that you heard a topic that I thought had more dynamite in it than perhaps anything that has been put on here for a long time. 1 want to give the people credit for giving it a.- nicely as they did, so that when the packer had the final say it was past lunch hour and the people were barred from entering into the dis - cussion. I think maybe it was a very good thing, because whatever we should do here, I don't know that it is necessary to take up the far- </seg>

I just want to make these remarks because the morning 1 left home to come down here, a good friend of .mine, a prominent farmer, a feeder and a breeder, made this remark to me. He said, "Charlie I never wanted to go to the meetings as iad as this time, but it is impossible for me to get away." And he told me why and it was on account of that discussion that was coming 1 up yesterday morning, and I thought then, that there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of farmers over the- state of Nebraska who would like- very much to be here during these meetings, but it is impossible for them to leave their business and their management. Now, folks, as I said, the program this morning is sort of a mix - ture. It sounds to me that way, any way when I read it. If you find ■ it of interest, and we run a little over the noon hour, I don't think any - body will seriously object. This afternoon I know we all will wish to hear the prominent speakers here from abroad. The first speaker on the program is Mr. Harold Hedges. "Around the Corner." If you can guess what he is going to say you have got me beat. Mr. Harold Hedges. "AROUND THE CORNER" Mr. Chairman, Ladies and jGentleman: The cattlemen is a decidedly optimistic individual just now [and not without reason. Who wouldn't ' feel optimistic when he is selling cattie which cost him 8 or 10 dollars a hundred at 14 to 16 dollars,] and with a reasonable feed bill too. I am not here to expound on the glowing outlook for the cattlemen nor am I carrying a bucket of cold water to cool the ardor of the optimist. Instead, I want to call to your attention briefly some present and past facts that may give us a hint of what the future may hold for the cattle industry. The Market is an Uncertain Thing The market road is not level and straight, permitting a long clear view ahead. Quite the contrary. There are hills and hollows, twists and turns, rough spots and stretches of easy going. Certainly, such a road is not likely to become monotonous. We who travel that road are constantly wondering what may be over the next hill or around the next corner. An old cattleman who has been in the game for 20 or 30 years may say that he has been over the road many a time and knows every twist and turn. Still I doubt if he would care to drive over it with his eyes shut. Roads, like many other things which are the result of human endeavor, are subject to change. There may be a bridge out requiring a detour. There may be new construction under way and the warning signs advise us to proceed cautiously. </seg>
            <seg id="p644">KKPOHT OF XEBKASKA STATE HOARD OP AGRICULTUKE To carry this analogy a little further, ] am going to liken market statistics to a road map. A road map is a pretty convenient thing to have when one is in strange territory. Even in familiar territory it may prove quite useful at times. Occasionally, you find that de - tours an- /lcce.-.-.n-y — there are lots of them along the market road. The detours often take you away from the familiar track. Then it is that the road map may prove invaluable in picking a new route. If market statistics may be likened to the road map, then cur - rent market news — the present facts — may be likened to the road markings along the way. Even though you have a guide book and road map — the facts of the past — you still keep your eyes on the road ahead. The road sign causes you to slow up for the turn or warns you to glance to right or left and thus you may avoid accidents or col - lisions. It. may advise you of rough going ahead. It may warn you of a detour so that you may change your course and avoid delay, dis - comfort or disaster. As for myself, I am firmly convinced that a study of market statistics is of real help in giving one an understanding of market factors and their effects. It helps to better one's judgment in arriving at conclusions as to what the future may hold. Charts and figures may appear pretty dry at times but they often tell a very interesting story — and it is not always fiction either. The past year has seen a decided change in the cattle prices sit - uation and we are all in considerable doubt as to what may happen next I am going to cite a little past history in the form of a chart and let it tell its story. Then I want to discuss it in the light of present information so that we may decide whether its story is one of fact or fiction— whether we can trust it as an indicator of what the future may hold for you cattlemen. Prices Follow Cycles There is quite a well founded theory in the livestock industry that production and consequently prices tend to go in rather definite cycles. There is the four or five year cycle in hogs and the 14 or 16 cycle in cattle. The chart before you illustrates the cycles in the cattle in - dustry. You will note three high points in the purchasing power of beef cattle since 1880. The first high point is in 1885, the next in 1899. There is a lapse of 14 years between peaks. The third high point is in 1915, sixteen years after the high point in 1899. Those were the three periods in the last 50 years when cattle production was almost profitable. If history is to repeat itself, we would expect the next peak in purchasing power of cattle to come between 1929 and 1931. Possi - bly, history won't repeat itself; possibly we do not have the same fac - tors influencing cattle prices that we had in previous periods; perhaps there are new factors of importance to consider. </seg>
            <seg id="p645">.VKBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATK As I. see it, there is a difference between the viewpoint of the ' cattle producer and that of the cattle feeder toward high price.;. The range cattleman is producing a raw product to be converted into a finished product by others along the market route. His main interest is in a high selling price to cover his production cost and give him a margin of profit. The viewpoint of the feeder is somewhat different. He is not so directly interested in whether the level of cattle prices is high or low as he is in three other things: first, the margin between ' what he pays for his feeder cattle and what he gets for his finished stuff; second, the cost of feed; and third, the general trend of cattle . prices— whether up or down. The cattle feeder would much rather have advancing prices than high prices, because 'every advance adds to his feeding margin. Even so, I have heard feeders say they can make more money when cattle prices are high than when prices are low. It takes only so many pounds of feed to put on a 100 pounds of gain and it is an advantage to sell gain at a high price. . . Feeding Margin* Vary Now let us get back to our proposition of feeding margins and cost of feed for a moment. The second chart shows two things. The heavy black line shows the ratio of corn prices to cattle prices year by year since 1910. Chicago prices for corn and cattle were used in the calculation. The ration represents the number of bushels of corn that a hundred pounds of beef cattle will buy. When that ratio line is at a low point it means that a hundred pounds of cattle will not pay for many bushels of corn. In other words, corn is high in price. (Shows chart). The second line on the chart — the red one — shows the margin between the average yearly price of beef steers and the average price paid for stockers and feeders on the Chicago Market. Sometimes margins were wide— as much as $4.65 in 1919 — and sometimes quite narrow— down to $1.20 in 1913. However, the interesting thing of the whole chart is the relation of the two lines to each other. It means simply this: When corn is relatively high . it is compensated for by wider feeding margins; when corn is relatively low, feeding margins , are narrow. Thus do cattle feeders as a group adjust their operations to the changing situation. ! The third proposition of concern to cattle feeders — whether cattle j prices are advancing or declining — enters in here, too. In the five i yi'ar period prior to 1915, the purchasing power of cattle was ad - vancing. Corn was not unduly low as compared to cattle prices, but \ feeding margins were unusually narrow. The narrow margins were compensated for by the advanced tendency in cattle purchasing power. We are mainly interested in these charts which summarize the past history of the cattle market as they may serve as guide maps which </seg>
            <seg id="p646">KKri'KT UK M.li|:.\SK.\ STATIC UOAKI) OF AGlUCULTfllK indicate what the future may hold in store. If one were to judge from tin' cyclical movement of cattle prices in the last fifty years, the conclusion would be that a period of strong cattle 'very likely lies around the corner. Can we find any market data to support that con - clusion".' Receipts Largely Determine Cattle Purchasing Power The range situation has always had an important bearing in the beef cattle market. If I were to chart Chicago range cattle receipts on the first chart which shows purchasing power of cattle, you would see that periods of heavy range cattle receipts were periods of low purchasing power and vice versa. Range cattle receipts in Chicago this fall have been running much below a year ago. Even allowing for a greater movement direct from range to feed lot, the range cat - tle supply this fall has been below the average of the past few years. Total market receipts of cattle (67 markets) for the year to Decem - ber 1 were about 4 1-2 per cent smaller than a year ago while stocker and feeder shipments in the same period were 3 1-2 per cent under a year ago. Stocker and feeder shipments from 12 principal markets between July and November were 18 per cent below a year ago. While the winter beef supply may be much smaller than a year ago, a greater deficiency appears likely later. The average cost of beef steers in Chicago in early December was 40 per cent above a year ago. Total market supplies of beef dur - ing September, October, and November were 13 per cent under the same three months in 1926. Evidently a large part of the price ad - vance is not warranted by the decline in receipts to date but is in an - ticipation of still smaller market supplies later.

            <seg id="p647">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCrATIC . . Young Cattle Now Predominate Since 1920 there has been a continous reduction in cattle numbers in the United States. Estimates put the total reduction at 11 million head, making present numbers 17 per cent smaller than in 1920. The reduction in breeding herds added to the marketing of current pro - duction during the seven year period has accounted for the low level of cattle prices. A change m range production methods has occurred also as you are aware. The day of the big steer has passed and we have instead the quick-maturing younger animal. This charge called for the disposal of the surplus aged stuff in the past few years. That liquidation is now pretty well over and the range country is now down to a calf and yearling basis. We have records on 48 Sand Hill ranches for a 3 year period,, which should indicate what changes if any have occurred in that ranch - ing territory. Of the cattle sold in 1924-25 (largely in the fall of 1924) 51 per cent were calves and yearling. Two years later, 69 per cent were calves and yearlings. In the spring of 1924, 54 per cent of the • cattle, yearlings or older, were in the breeding herd. Last spring, 60 per cent of the cattle were cows and bulls. With the change to the calf and yearling basis of production, a larger number of cows will be necessary to produce the same beef ton - nage. As yet the Nebraska Sand Hill ranches have not expanded their cow herd, the number of cows remained practically unchanged dur - ing the past 4 years. With favorable prices again, the tendency to expand production is much in evidence and cows will be retained longer in the herds. A beef cattleman may not like the old dairy cow but she must not be left out of our calculations. The dairy industry has been growing quite consistently for many years, and discarded dairy cows and the veal calves which are by-products of that industry make up an important source of beef. Prices for. dairy products are still satisfactory enough to encourage continued expansion in the milk cow. business. The Outlook is Quite Favorable Summing up the cattle situation, our conclusion must be that the outlook is quite favorable, {and several years of light market supplies and firm prices are ahead. Nobody knows when the peak will be. Perhaps we are not at or near it now. Certainly it is true that pres - ent'prices more tha 1 ! discount the decrease in market supplies that has been made so far and discounts much of the probably future decrease.

They have become accustomed to cheap beef, and higher prices, even though they may be reasonable in relation to other prices, will be resisted. Then there is the foreign cattle situation to be consid - ered. Cattle producers should be vitally interested in keeping out foreign beef if they want present prices to be maintained. In conclusion, let me return to my opening analogy. It is well to approach the corner ahead with caution. A careful look out should be maintained for signs that may tell us of the nature and condition of the road ahead. And last but not least, perhaps it would be well to slow down occasionally and consult the road maps and guide books to make sure you are headed in the general direction you desire and toward the right destination — satisfactory profits. QUESTION: Does the increased price of cattle tend to draw up the prices of corn? ANSWER: I think that first chart we had there showed that very materially, because during periods of high cattle prices, the prices of corn seems to gradually come up to meet them. A good many peo - ple think that cattle are pretty high right now, and are inclined to change their views, and that is one thing that may hurt the market in the near future. Usually high feed and low cattle seems to put poorer finished types of beef on the market, and I think with the. feed- the way it is, which isn't very high, coupled with the cattle prices, it would be a good plan to finish them a little better. MR. GRAFF, Chairman: Right along that line statistics sometimes are a little faulty. This gvntleman over here brought up a matter in connection with cattle statistics that proves that. We know that is a fact. While Mr. Hedges was talking I was sitting and listening and doing a little thinking. Breeders Have Passed Through a Bad Period This program is under the auspices of the Improved Livestock Breeders of Nebraska. I might leave a word with you this morning that will be of more or less interest to you along that line. I am an ex-livestock breeder of Nebraska but I left those to follow me to take up where I left off, and I wonder sometimes if we hadn't better find time at the meeting in a year from now to discuss the problem of the Improved Livestock breeder. I want to tell you men this morning what the present situation is in the cattle industry in Nebraska, and in fact all over the country. The purebred beef breeders have been selling largely all their breeding stock at the market. They have gone for beef. They have realized more in that way on their surplus cattle than they could to sell them as breeders. The purebred breeder, as you know, hundreds of them have gone out of commission. You know </seg>
            <seg id="p649">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATI that the purebred record associations have had a hard time to finance their breed businesses. You know that the large prominent livestock Journals of the country have had to take their share of the loss. I have got it from the most reliable authorities that the Breeders Gazette, • a newspaper or publication, the only one of its kind, that practically circulates throughout the entire civilized world has sunk several hun - dred thousand dollars in their enterprise during this deflation period. You know that with' that condition there is going to be a reaction. The purebred breeders, in order' to save themselves, are selling largely their surplus breeding stock that goes to the block. It might be of in - terest to you to just site a condition that I am well acquainted with, because it was my sons that have gone, through that experience the last year — a surplus of breeding cattle. They started out with a car load of cattle on the show circuit. They stayed j out on the circuit and went to the International. The only kind of cattle that they could sell were the cheaper ones, those that they would price at prac - tically the same as they would bring on the market for beef. They had a big load in Chicago, 16 head, a 40 foot car just about all they could ram in. They left 6 of them at Chicago, that went to the packers. The feeders wouldn't buy them and they were too high for the breeders. A junior yearling heifer that weighed 1190 brought $14.75. An old bull that they bred, raised, and his ancestors two or three gener - ations back, a good animal, a good individual, well bred, in fact he was a senior and grand champion at 8 of the big shows over the country. I said, "Boys don't take that bull home. You haven't any use for him." the packers paid $10.75 per hundred. He brought §242.40. Men, I want you to remember that the time is coming, if you are going to buy any purebred seed stock that you will have to pay an enormous price for it. The time has passed when you can buy a good breeding bull for $100 to §125. No breeder can produce a good purebred breeding animal for that price. You | are going to have trouble in finding breed - ing bulls. In fact for over 30 odd years that I have been in the business I have never seen: the time that I have felt that the oppor - tunity was as fine as it is today for that farmer who is growing some boys in connection with his other enterprises on the farm to raise a little foundation of good breeding livestock, especially is that true in Nebraska. Now on the program vte have this* morning with us the champion 4-H Club team. I will cal. on Bruce S. Russell to handle that sub - ject. Is he present? MR BRUCE S. RUSSELL: Ladies and Gentlemen!

I persuaded Professor Gramlich, knowing his worst failing, he has a " tendency to want to play to the galleries, and I have convinced him that the shorter his talk will be this morning, the bigger the applause will be. PROFESSOR H. J. GRAMLICH: CATTLE FAX The cattle industry is rapidly finding its stride and like the new - born butterfly has emerged from the cocoon with a brilliance which i is very conspicious in the bright rays of the morning sun. Possibly we ( have already become too enthusiastic and permitted our effervescence , to get the better of our judgment. This seems scarcely probable as there it a unanimity of sentiment to the effect that there is a cattle shortage and that the demand will continue to be greater than the supply lor several years to come. All classes of cattle have been selling at very high prices, during the past six months. Feed lots are "ulay filied with steers, which have cost much more than any which have dined at the feed bunks of the Cornbelt during the past seven or eight years. If our market holds a.s it gives evidence of doing, these cattle will return profits and those who are backing the Industry will tie made happy. . . j </seg>
            <seg id="p651">XEBKASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS ASSOCIATI Livestock Prices Will Equalize Themselves There are a few things which should be kept in mind and possibly a brief review of these would not be out of place. Eventually the. price of all classes of stock must become somewhat equalized. The $15.00 finished steer is rather high when compared to the $8.00 hog. Either cattle will come down or hogs will go up.. Probably we will find that both will happen and that in the course of time' the values of the two will be considerably closer than at present. While cattle look very attractive at the present time, it is just possible that is will be well for the cattle man of the covnbelt to have some hogs and pin his faith in two nest eggs rather than one, as sooner or later- we are bound .to have an equalization. There are some funamental truths which will always hold an'd which can not be trifled with. One of these is that young cattle will produce beef at a more efficient degree than older cattle. At this writing, small cattle are receiving but a limited degree of publicity be - cause most of us have heard only of the fabulous profits which heavy steers have made during the past year. In many instances, these animals have yielded profits of from forty to eighty dollars per head following short periods Of ownership. On the other hand, those who have plodded along with light cattle have been forced to hold them much longer and have found when the day of reckoning came that they had only made a nominal pkofit on their enterprise. I think it well to call attention to two facts! First, that a year ago last fall the woods were full of heavy cattle. They were a drug upon the market. No - body wanted them either in the finished form or in feeder condition and, accordingly, every transaction made with heavy cattle represented a bigjoss to the seller. Acres of one thousand to eleven hundred pound feeders left the range country at six to six and one-half cents per pound net. At the same time thousands of head of fifteen hun - dred pound steers that had been fed upon a heavy corn ration for up - wards of a year were glutting the Kansas City, Omaha and Chicago markets and bring but eight to eight and one-half cents per pound. Many .of these were cattle that had gone into the feed lot costing from one to two dollars per hundred more than they wore sell - ing for. Consequently, conditions then were directly opposite to what they now are. ■ Young Cattle Gain Most Economically It might be interesting to state that experimental work conducted at the University of Nebraska over a period of six years tended to show conclusively that calves and yearlings made gains much more efficient - ly and were a much safer proposition from the standpoint of the feeder' than older cattle. Furthermore, the vast majority of people in the United States. want beef from light carcasses. The only reason that </seg>
            <seg id="p652">REPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE heavy cattle are enjoying much of popularity at the present time is that there is a shortage of them and scarcely enough can be found to supply the needs of the larger hotels and high-class restaurants of the east which must have heavy finished cuts for their established trade Consequently, the beef business still looks to be a cow and calf pro - position. During the past fall, feeder calves cost the cornbelt farmers $25 to $45 per head. Indications are that they will cost an equally high figure next fall. The man in the cornbelt is asking whether he would not be better off to procure cows and raise his own feeders? This can be answered by stating that the practice is profitable when cattle are high and unprofitable when they are low. We probably will have several years of high-priced beef cattle and it might pay a corn belt farmer to maintain a small breeding herd during this period. On some farms, this undoubtedly would be a splendid plan. These animals would use up vast quantities of rough feed which has relatively low value for other purpose. The range operator can raise calves to bet - ter advantage and he probably will be depended upon to furnish the supply necessary to fill most of the nations feed lots. Certainly the man on the good cornbelt farm who decides to raise cattle should count upon raising good ones. If it will be profitable to raise any calves , it will be those which can be finished into prime baby beeves. Good Price.-How Long Will They Last We are often confronted with the query of how long this era of high-pnced beef will last. There are so many factors which enter into the determining of the price level of any commodity that one hesitates to even make a guess to an answer to such a question. A few fun - damental points can be taken into account. We know that it is im - possible to increase cattle stocks very materially short of a five-year period. If there is a serious shortage at this time, it will be prac - tically impossible to increase the number to a point where there will be an over-supply in less than three to four years. Should the demand for beef continue to expand, it might require an even longer period to bring production to a point where supply would satisfy current demands. On the other side of the question, we must remember that a greatly reduced production of corn with consequent high prices of the same might tend to alter livestock values. Likewise, should some - thing in the nalurn of a financial calamity hit the country and materi - ally effect the buying power of the consuming public, we would have a serious factor to contend with in fixing beef values. In the main, it would seem as though there would be several years of comparatively high prices of beef animals and that this could be a good time for a person to operate along beef production lines without expanding to too great a degree but at the same time being in a position to take ad - vantage of the favorable market.

            <seg id="p653">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATIC MR. GRAFF, Chairman: Now the next speaker on the program, folks, is the gentleman ■from Missouri. He is going to talk to you on Baby Beef. Mr. Burch. MR J. W. BURCH: PRODUCTION AND FEEDING BEEF CALVES The last few years have .seen a great many good beef cows sent to. market. Farmers and bankers have held to the theory that a beef cow could not be kept a year under Corn Belt conditions for the calf she. would raise. The Animal Husbandry Extension Department; set out 4 years" ago to- establish demonstrations on farms where -beef cows were kept and get a record on the cost of keeping beef cows when they were economically and intelligently maintained. In 192G records on 22 herds containing o20 cows showing thut the feed cost per cow for . the year was $lfU0. §(i.2O per head was added for bull service, in - terest and taxes making a cost figure of $25.30 outside of labor. In 1927 records on 17 herds with 346 cows showed a feed cost of $21.30. This added to the charge for bull service, interest and taxes gave a figure of §27.50. This low feed cost for the year cah only be obtained where a maximum use of rough feeds, such as stalk fields, fodder and un - salable hay is made. Very little grain was used during the winter on these demonstration herds. One cooperator insisted on feeding shock • corn and in seven weeks during the winter fed his cows $15.00 worth of feed per cow, making his cost per cow for the year twice that of the average. Good legume hay was fed in small amounts supplementing the coarser roughages. The more successful cooperators supplemented their blue grass pastures with sweet clover. They did not over stock their pastures during the summer and had plenty of winter pasture when the weather was open. ■ ' Use a Good Bull . One fact has been outstanding in the demonstration work. A good pure bred bull must be used if profitable calves are produced. At the Sni-a-Bar farms 42 steer calves were divided into four lots and put on feeding test. Four of these calves were sired by an ordinary grade bull. The others were sired by good blocky pure bred bulls. At weaning time the calves sired by the grade bull were worth $2.00 ner cwt. less than the other calves fed exactly the same way. They averaged 560 lbs. in weight, which means that $11.20 per head was •«&gt;st by the use of the grade bull. </seg>
            <seg id="p654">UKI-OKT «.K NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Farmers who have good regular producing herds of cows are making their replacements from their own heifers because of the great danger of contagious abortion where cows are bought and brought into the herd. It is quite obvious that there is no one way of handling the calves that arc produced. Men who have strictly grazing farms will produce and sell feeder calves. Those that have larger amounts of corn to market through cattle will feed their calves out as fat yearlings while another class, quite numerous in Missouri, who have some corn and wish to market a fat animal with a minimum amount of corn feed the calves gram while they are nursing and sell them the first fall when they are around nine months old. Calves fed grain while nursing are usually fairly early ones drop - ped in February or March. They are started on feed in May or June so that they will be eating well when the hot weather, flies and short pastures cause the cows to slow up on the milk supply.

Both methods have proven sat - isfactory; therefore, the one to follow on the individual farm will depend upon the size of the herd, the location of pastures, the available labor and other factors. If the creep is to be used satisfactorily in fattening calves it must be located where the calves will pass it at least once each day while following their mothers. The ideal location for the creep is in the shade, near the place of watering. A salt box placed at or near the creep will tend to cause the calves to spend some time in that vicinity. </seg>

The creep should be constructed so that the calves can get into it easily and have plenty of room at the trough: The creep may be built from lumber, barbed wire or poles. The openings should be about 2 feet wide by 3 feet high. These openings will give room for the calves to enter and still be small enough to keep out the cows. A large self-feeder similar to those used for feeding hogs may be placed on legs and used in the creep. instead of a trough. This will keep the grain dry and prevent some waste. There should be little difficulty in getting the calves to go into the creep if it is properly located. However, it will be helpful to drive the cows and calves to the creep once each day for a few days, or it may be necessary to shut the calves in a lot for a while to teach them to eat grain. If there is an older calf that has been eating grain it will go into the creep readily and eat grain and the younger ones will follow. . - . ■ Feeding Grain to Calves Separated From Their Mothers Calves that are to be separated from their mothers, and allowed to nurse twice each day should bo provided with good pasture, shade and fresh water. Calves handled in this manner should be allowed to nurje ami to have their regularly. Care should be taken in getting the calves- started on feed in order to prevent scouring. It is probably that some dry roughage, such as good quality legume hay will prevent scouring. Whether the calves are creep fed or separated from their mothers, all feeders and troujrhs should be kent clean and free from mouldy or spoiled feed. They should be cleaned at least every two or three days. </seg>

Calves weighing above 530 pounds at weaning time and carrying sufficient fat may bo sold for slaughter at that time, although in many cases carrying to a heavier weight will be advisable. Those that are lighter usually will return more profit if fed until they weigh a minimum of 550 pounds. Heifers for slaughter purposes will sell at about the same price as steers of the same cjuality if sold when weighing 700 pounds or less. Calves fed grain while nursing will weigh at least 100 pounds more at weaning time than similar calves that receive no grain At Sni-a-Bar the grain fed calves when weaning at 7 1-2 months of age weighed 487 lbs. and were worth $2.00 per cwt. less. In the demonstration work in Missouri this year a summary of 10 herds where complete information was available on the sale of calves shows there w as a net return of $21.27 per calf after the cost of feed for the cows and calves, interest, taxes and bull sen-ice had been de - ducted. A study of the following table shows that calves have been more profitable this year than in 1926.

If the cow cost was figured at §30.00 per head this would still leave §40.00 per head profit. The 1927 prices of course are unusally high, but for the past four years these good, fat 600 to 700 lbs. calves have been bringing $10.00 per cwt. at home for steers and heifers.

DOES IT PAY TO CREEP FEED RANGE CALVES? I am very sorry that Mr. Swenson could not "choose to run here in 1928." Yesterday, Mr. Snipes, our Cass County Agent demanded that I substitute. Now as some of you know Snipes is a very deter - mined Missouri Democrat, and it takes about as much nerve to resist him as to try to tell you all something about creep feeding calves, so you see 1 may be following the line of least resistance. Back in the days when 1 played football, 1 used to substitute some but then 1 had the advantage of considerable coaching.

We like to get as many calves as possible before grass comes, for the later calves cannot handle all the milk at first, and so the udders require considerable attention for a while. We tried to keep the cost of our cows to a limit so that we can afford to sell our surplus to the packer profitably. In the case of the sire, we removed the limit, as we consider the right type of a Scotch Bull a large part of the herd. Began Using Self-feeder About a year ago, one of my boys conceived the idea of building a small self-feeder, suitable for either calves or hogs. Possibly the Ag. College is responsible for that. With about $35 worth of material he constructed a 75 bushel capacity feeder 4 feet wide, 5 feet high and 8 feet long, with V type bottom, and side troughs 5 inches deep and 10 inches wide. The roof boards extend over the sides, so the drip escapes the trough. It is built on skids and easily moved. At the time we had 10 or more late fall calves following their dams so we placed the feeder in one corner of the lot where the breeding cows stay at night, and constructed a creep to admit only the calves. , , The calves soon learned to use the feeder. We coaxed them in at first by putting some nice, pea green alfalfa hay along from the en - trance to the trough so they entered of their own accord and were not afraid. Owing to drouth conditions during 1926, we were short of alf - alfa, and as the price of- cotton cake was low, we used cake ground with ear corn to supply more protein.

            <seg id="p660">KEFOUT OK XEUKAJJKA STATE HOARD OP AGRICULTURE The calves seemed to get accustomed to this feed with almost no cases of scouring. When grass came, we moved the feeder to the pasture and before long the spring calves of 4 to 6 weeks old were enjoying it of their own accord. During the summer we used corn and oats, not ground, and ran out of cotton cake. Creep Feeding Payi Unfortunately, we have no scales, and have not been able to weigh the feed and the calves at proper intervals, so I fear I cannot give very reliable information as to how well this plan will pay. How - ever, I feel sure that our calves during the summer were carrying more flesh than usual, together with a good, hearty growth. In fact, they looked so good to us that about November 15 we sent a truck load ol heifers to Omaha. They weighed 800 pounds in Omaha, and brought $12.50 or $100 per head. That is $10.00 more money than we usually get for them, steers and all, the following June at an average of 14 months and 900 pounds weight. Our reason we think it pays is be - cause we have solved the trouble of weaning time by using it. The cows fuss a little but the calves don't seem to care much, and as they are on feed they get right down to business in the feed lot, and the feeder takes care of the new crop of fall calves about corn husking time, and it surely does save a lot of chores. Also when a farmer feeds his own crop ol calves, they are bound to be more or less uneven, due to difference in age. The feeding of a spring calf until he is well finished is a long slow task and cannot be hurried much. By using the creep on a bunch of 30 calves, one can cut out a truck load of 10 at 3 different seasons of the year, and have them fairly well finished. It also gives him an opportunity to take ad - vantage of any higH spots in the market. If he is planning to sell some of his best bull calves or the most promising heifers to fellow breeders, they are better fitted and more attractive and we don't need to be ashamed of them at any time. It certainly is a labor saver and we see no reason why it is not equally efficient on a small herd or a large one. I am sorry I cannot give you definite figures as to pounds of feed per head or per pound of gain, but we like it, and the calves like it, and we will probably use it 366 days this year. 1 thank you. MR GRAFF: Unfortunately our next speaker has found it impossible to be with us but in his absence Mr. Waggener has consented to give us a few figures from the operations which he is conducting that should be of interest. </seg>
            <seg id="p661">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS' ASSOCIATK MR WAGGENER: DOES IT PAY TO CREEP FEED RANGE CALVES IN NEBRASKA I am extremely sorry that it was impossible for Mr. Hartman to be with you this morning. Mr. Hartman is a cattleman from Maxwell m the country south east of North Platte. Along with his other oper - ations he raised annually from sixty to seventy range calves from a herd of well bred Hereford cows. Last year, following the example of the Missouri farmers referred to by Mr. Burch, he decided to try creep feeding these pasture calves on grain during the summer and fall to determine if possible whether the practice was an economically sound one. He kept an accurate record of his operations and here are the results that Mr. Hartman himself sums up. "The creeps were made available to the calves July 18. The feeder was of 100 bushel capacity and was placed in a creep in the shade near the watering and salting grounds. The grain was mixed at the home ranch and hauled 5 miles to the pasture where the creep was located. "The calves were started on a half and half mixture of corn chop and oats, but later changed to whole corn and oats because the corn chop was blowing out quite badly. Still later in the season a little barley was added along with the oats and corn already being used. "The calves took to the feeding quite readily, and by the middle ox August were taking sufficient grain to cause a few of them to scour somewhat. They were carried. on thru until November 1, when they were sold at the farm weighing 453 pounds each. •They ate a total of: 232 bushels of corn at .75 ..$174.00 368 bushels of oats at .50 .. 184.00 41 bushels of. barley at .61 .... 24.60 Total .. $382.60 delivered at the creep Haulage charge .. 12.50 641 bushels of grain cost .---$395.10 delivered at the creep On the average each calf consumed approximately 10 bushel of grain costing _.$ 6.00 Mr. Hartman was well satisfied with the results obtained, it be - ing apparent that his calves weighed about 60 pounds more than usual and. would have sold at weaning" time at fully $-10 more per Head, than they would have without the grain. Assuming that those figures are correct, the calves returned him about four dollars per head over his feed cost for his trouble of creep feeding them. The calves are being fed out for the spring market and more figures will be avail - able later. ' </seg>
            <seg id="p662">UliPtUlT i IK NKUKASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Another good cattleman in the state who has obtained satisfactory results from creep feeding his calves is Mr. J. 0. Swenson of Pleas - anton, up in Buffalo County. Mr. Swenson was requested to be at these meetings, but found it impossible to do so. I had the pleasure of visiting Mr. Swenson's ranch during the fore part of September. At that time his cattle were on short upland pasture. There were in all about 130 rather late calves which had access to two large .elf-feeders, in large barbed wire enclosures at both sides and both ends of which were creep calves eating at the creep at all times. About October 15 he made the mistake of turning the cows and calves on some green luxuriant bottom clover pasture with the result ' that the calves refused to continue to eat grain for some two weeks, j during which time they lost considerable finish. With your permission I will read a part of a letter from Mr. Swenson telling about his experiences with creep feeding. The letter carries the date of November 19. . i "These calves have eaten about 5 1-2 bushels of grain to date. \ esterday 1 delivered the steer calves to a man at Pleasanton, Started them away from here about eight in the morning, drove them seven [ miles and weighed up at two in the afternoon. Every steer born up to July 12 was sent, and there was quite a large number of late ones. .They weighed exactly 449 pounds, brought $11.40 per cwt. and netted me $51.25 a head. 1 kept the heifers and as nearly always true, they are the fattest. 1 will advise their weight, price feed etc., when I decide what to do with them. "Last year my steers from these same cows and bulls sold about the same date at $8.20 in Kansas City weighing 417 pounds. They brought $33.86 from which freight, commission, etc., must be deducted. If anything they were a bit earlier calves than mine this year. The calves this year evidently gained about 35 pounds in weight and at least u dollar in price by virtue of the $3.50 worth of grain they re - ceived. "I am well pleased with the operation and plan to try it again next year. 1 think this creep feeding business if handled properly holds the promise of a real money maker." These two examples I have given you, no doubt seem overly - optimistic but when considered in the light of recent experimental data they are not at all unreasonable. This station under the supervision of Mr. Gramlich has conducted extensive feeding tests which con - clusively prove that the calf is the most efficient producer of beef we have. Roughly these experiments show this: Take four beef animals of equal breeding and health, one being a three year old, one a two year old, one a yearling, and the other a calf.

            <seg id="p664">RKPOHT OF NKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE • COLORADO FEEDING RESULTS AS THEY APPLY TO NEBRASKA E. J. MAYNARD, COLORADO This is an age of information. An age of advice. You get it from everybody. From the government, from the state, from mixed feed concerns, mineral mixture companies, and many other sources. The big problem today, I think for most farmers is to pick the wheat from the chaff. In other words, you can't believe anything you see in print these days as you could in the days of Horace Greeley. I can say just as Mr. Burch has said, that the cattle feeding results secured here at this institution, are used all over the country. The comparisons that have been made between calves, yearlings, and two year olds; and the sex comparisons in feeding work are recognized as valuable through the west. Young Cattle Feed Most Economically Now here is the proposition from the range man's standpoint. He hasn't been able to make a go of two year old cattle. Each decade has found him marketing his stuff at an earily period and now he seems to see a possibility of these younger cattle paying out. He seems to see where he can run a cow herd, put all of his time on that cow herd, and not have to work with his yearlings and two year old steers, where he can increase the percentage of his calf crop so that he can make a reasonable interest on his equity. In other words, if he can get around $35.00 per head for calves he can show about 6 per cent interest on his operations, and the general results that have been secured here in Nebraska in the calf-feeding work would tend to indicate that a feeder can afford to pay a dollar to a dollar and half more per hundred weight for a calf, than he can afford to pay for a two year old feeder. Conditions are different in different parts of this country , and we must analyze experimental results to see whether they actually apply to our conditions. Now, of course, this analysis is not so necessary where the work is done under similar conditions with these that exist in your farm; but in reading farm papers and looking over the glowing reports that you get from mixed feed companies and mineral mixture companies and in getting information from other ex - perimental stations, see that they comply with the conditions that you have. Take for instance, the mineral mixture proposition. It is a live question with us out in Colorado at present. Now in ordinary farm rations, there are only 5 mineral elements that are ever likely to be lacking. They are sodium, chlorin, phosphorus, iodine, and cal - cium. Common salt will take care of sodium and chlorine. If you have a condition where there is a lack of iodine in your ration, it is generally indicated by some pathological condition such as goite'r. This leaves calcium and phosphorus for consideration. </seg>
            <seg id="p665">NEBRASKA IMPROVED LIVESTOCK BREEDERS 1 ASSOCIATIC Nebraska rations Carry Enough Mineral* One of the standard rations fed in Nebraska is shelled corn and alfalfa. Cottonseed cake added to this combination gave good re - sults in your last feeding experiment. Cottonseed cake is a very heavy carrier of available phosphorus, and alfalfa hay furnishes a plentiful supply of calcium, and so your mineral elements are all supplied with no need for an additional mix - ture. The feeding of a mineral mixture in a ration of this sort would be like putting sugar on candy. The question may occur, "Why do some experiment stations advocate the feeding of a simple mineral mixture, such as one composed of bone black, phosphorus, lime cake and a very small amount of potassium iodine. Some experiment station reports show that the feeding of a simple mineral mixture like this has been responsible for as much as ?5.00 per head more profit in fattening two year old steers. Let us analyze their ration. For instance, here is a ration that showed $5.00 per head benefit from a simple mineral mixture. They fed about 15 pounds shelled corn, 2 1-2 pounds linseed meal, 25 pounds corn ensilage, 1 pound of legume hay. Alfalfa hay here in Nebraska as well as in Colorado, is the back bone of the feeding industry. Alfalfa hay is .the high calcium feed that gives us all the calcium we need in our rations. Now there was a ration that didn't have sufficient legume hay and so in analyzing the ration, you find a lack of necessary calcium. You can see from this example the need for analysis of experimental results from other stations, where conditions may be radically different. The story of the Iowa farmer who went down to Florida to spend the winter illustrates this idea. He went to the Florida state fair. He saw a bunch of big, long legged, razor back hogs. He decided to show the people what a real hog looked like, so the next fall he shipped down a good, fat hog and entered it in the show. The judges didn't give it. a ribbon, however, and when he asked one of them why, the judge replied, "That's a good hog, stranger, but it can't run fast enough." "What do you want with speed in a hog?" he questioned indignantly. "Well, stranger," replied the judge, "Down here we figure that if a hog can't out run a nigger "it ain't worth a dam." Fattening Calves Requires Careful Feeding We find, along with Professor Gramlich, that it is safer to fatten younger cattle. We find, sometimes, though that we have more trouble in fattening cattle. They are harder to put on feed; they are more susceptible to some diseases that don't effect older cattle at all, but in the long run we find them more practical, I think, to fatten, be - cause they put on more economical gains and have a wider market outlet. .Out there we have barley to feed, and we feed quite a lot of </seg>

Steer. Outgain Heifers When Fed Together With mixed steer and open heifer calves we have had practically as good results when fed together as when fed in separate pens.

After we fed the heifers for 100 days they began to slow up on their gains, while the steers didn't slow up until after 180 days. Another thing which I expect most of you never do, but we see out there quite a bit, is to fatten calves without dehorning them. It is advisable to dehorn calves, particularly when there is some difference in size, because the larger ones drive the smaller ones away from the troughs. We raise our own calves for feeding experiments. We weigh </seg>

Now I have gone through this rather hurriedly, but I think I have touched the high spots, and if there are any questions that any of you • have, I will be glad to try to answer them. QUESTION: How old are the calves when you dehorn them? . MR. MAYNARD: They were April and May calves dehorned the first of November. I just want to jot down a table showing the gain that we secured with these steers and heifers fed together. ,■ Steers Heifer* Pound* Daily At.

' Spokane, Washington Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: Your Committee have asked me to speak of a comparatively new but. very important industry in the Northwest, i. e., that of Potato Glowing. In order that we may better comprehend the present, I want to briefly review the past. During pioneer days, and that was but yesterday in the Northwest, farmers had but little need for cash. They produced practically every - thing which their homes required. Their surplus of production was readily sold at the local stores, or exchanged for what they needed. In the matter of potatoes they planted whatever variety or quality of seed they had and produced, almost withvmt cost, sufficient for their home use and, generally, a small surplus which they delivered at the local stores, most always in bulk, unsacked and ungraded, or sacked in just any old sack, for the use of their neighbors in town. In those days, town-people, like the farmers, bought whatever they required of clothing, equipment and food in the rough raw state, paying a low cost and demanding nothing of style or beauty. Fanners fo'rmed the habit of offering their produce in an ungraded, unwhole - some and unpleasing condition. ■ Since all their surplus production was consumed locally or near home, they had no freight or transportation problem. The production was not above the demand, hence there was little or no competition. But while the farmer was becoming thoroughly set in this slovenly crude manner of offering his produce, there were three very important changes going on and progressing very rapidly. He seemed to be un - aware of them, though they all affected him vitally. One was the very rapid increase of production over local demand This brought abundant competition in the home market and forced practically every grower to ship, at least a portion of his crop to a far distant market for consumption. This involved heavy transportation cost and, ultimately, the net price received in the distant market governed the price of that portion sold at home. The second change was in the amount of cash he required to properly run his farm and maintain his home.

Our wives and daughters are not to be blamed Tor it. It has been forced upon them. They cannot escape tor ignore it. nor can we. The third change, which to me seems most important of all, is that the "Buying Public" has almost completely reversed its old time practice of buying for utility only. Today it is not the amount of food contained in a load or parcel, or the amount of warmth or wear in a garment, but "How does it look?" The people of today will pay many times more money for garments which make them look chic than they, will for garments which keep them comfortable. They will spend ten dollars to satisfy their fancy - more readily than they will spend one dollar to satisfy their hunger. In food, as in clothing, they will pay any price asked for that which is attractive, but nn ill refuse to pay almost any price for that which is unattractive or displeasing to the eye. As yv&gt;u see from the sample packages before you, and which I selected almost at random in one of your stores this morning, the buying public today demands its food supply put up in an attractive and small package. Many of these containers, as well as thousands of others on the market today, cost several times the cost of the content. The day of the 100 lb. sack of flour, rolled oats, or sugar is gone. The quarter of beef, the side of pork, the firkin of butter, the barrel of apples, the whole cheese, or the case of eggs is no more for the home. Instead, we have the small attractive, often the individual package, wrapped in tinfoil or in glass for one person one meal. Surely then the patched and filthy bag containing 100 or more pounds of dirty, ungraded potatoes, one-half hog feed or waste, is a relic of the past. The producers or dealers who put out these fancy packages shown here are getting their cost with "Big Plus." Their bank accounts are large. Their homes are luxurious. Their standing in the community is A-l. Why not follow their lead? Don't envy them! Imitate them! The last generation felt a change coming, but did not fully com - prehend it, would not admit it to be as complete or as vital as it is.

THE MARKET FOR NEBRASKA CERTIFIED SEED POTATOES Wm. MORROW, Manager, Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative, Alliance, Nebr. Our present meetings have called to mind the meetings at Chadron four years ago. We have the same good judge for our show that we had at that time. A good many of the same growers are in attend - ance that were present at the Chadron meetings. In 1923 we had over 300 cars of certified seed to place on the market and certified seed was not bringing satisfactory prices. This was evidenced by the larger attendance then, as well as the larger exhibition of show pota - toes. It is regretable that we do not take the same interest in our meetings when satisfaction prevails that we do when general dissatis - faction is manifest. Production had been .very greatly increased in 1923 and in spite of the fact that growers had been continually urged by those in charge of seed potato certification, to advertise and give some attention to the expansion of their market, no action had been taken. As a result, we were faced by over-production that year. Louisiana had always been the principal and most profitable market for certified seed, largely be - cause of the results of experimental work and demonstrations con - ducted by our University Department of Horticulture in that State Texas had been an important consumer but was unwilling to pay much of a premium for certified seed. Most growers had held their crop for the Louisiana market and did not seem to realize that more certified potatoes had been produced in Nebraska than would be used in Louisi - ana and there were a good many other states catering to the same market. </seg>
            <seg id="p680">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This is the fourth year of our co-operative marketing and our pro - duction is comparable to some extent to 1923. We have over 300 cars of Certified seed and our production has been greatjly increased over, last year. The Co-operative has furnished a mediufn. through which revenue for advt rtisinjr might be raised and advertising carried out in every Triumph seed consuming: region. We have n\!»t only done work in Louisiana, but in several other Southern States as well. We have tried to keep our marketing so systematized that resident distributors in each section worked with us in securing the best possible price for Nebraska certified seed. As a result our crop this year has moved at much better prices than it did in 1923 and certainly at a sufficient premium over the best uncertified to make certified I seed potato pro - duction profitable and attractive. I do not have figures at hand that would indicate the number of cars of Triumph seed that is used in the South. W,e know that the entire south uses considerably more seed potatoes than Nebraska will supply in the near future, therefore the exact quantity used is not im - portant. We must never lose sight of the fact th'at the premium secured on Nebraska Certified Seed is secured purely on a basis of quality. Other Triumph producing sections are continually striving to get a comparable product on the market and some of them are already putting good certified seed Triumphs into our markets although not in large volume. We must not only maintain our quality of seed and pack but must constantly strive to improve it or some other state is going to get our business. This year Nebraska Certified Seed will be shipped to Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, Arkansas, The Bermuda Islands and Porto Rico. In every one of these sections we can hope to increase our market, just as long as we continue to satisfy our customers by giving them the most seed value for their money. NEW DEVELOPMENTS WITH POTATO DISEASES R. W. GOSS, Assoc. Plant Pathologist, Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station During this discussion of potato diseases I am going to confine my remarks to those diseases which have either appeared serious for the first time in Nebraska or which are of common occurrence but due to certain factors have caused more damage than usual during the past summer. I assume that you are all fairly well familiar with the symp - toms of most of these diseases so I will not spend much time in des - cribing them. </seg>
            <seg id="p681">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Black Leg Many questions have been asked during the past summer in regard to the rather wide-spread appearance and seriousness of the black-leg disease. Many of you were not familiar with the symptoms of this disease which had not previously been considered of any importance in this state. Black-leg plants usually appear. early in the season as a small dwarfed plant with yellow rolled leaves. When pulled up the underground stem is found to be affected with a soft black rot from which the disease gets its. name. Such plants usually die before any tubers are formed. Plants may become infected later in the year and these symptoms will appear in a milder or modified form but the di - sease will progress to the new tubers forming a soft black rot at the stem end of the potato and often producing a brown discoloration of the vascular system which is difficult to distinguish from Fusarium in - fectiwn. During the past seven years I have observed this disease in only a few fields and then in small amounts. This past summer the disease appeared in seed stocks which had not been known to be infected pre - viously and sometimes 2 to 4 percent of the field was infected. This sudden occurrence of a previously unimportant disease is difficult to explain. Due to the recent work of Dr. Leach of Minn. Experiment Sta - tion, however, we are able to understand considerably more about this disease than was previously known. It has been proven that the seed corn maggot serves as the chief means of transmitting this disease. This insect which appears in the adult stage as a small fly about half as large as a house fly lays its eggs in the ground near the potato seed pieces. When the fly becomes infected from feeding upon infected plants or tubers with the bacterial organism causing black-leg, the eggs which it lays are covered with the bacteria. When the egg- hatches the larvae crawling over the surface of the egg become infected and then carry the organism t» the seed piece. The seed piece becomes infected and due to the combined action of the maggots and bacteria the seed piece decays and the disease advances up the sprout. The maggot's pupate in the soil and when the adult fly emerges it is infected, so that the insect carries the bacteria throughout its entire life cycle. More than one brood of insects occur during the summer and this gives rise to the late season infection of potatoes previously referred to. Both the disease and the insect occur under cool, moist conditions such as we have had this year. The disease has not been proved to live over winter in the soil, but it can live over in infected tubers and probably for a number of generations in the insect. The disease at present can only be controlled by planting healthy </seg>

Even with such practices in force it is evident from this years observations that the disease can occur when favorable conditions exist such as we have had this summer. We have had three, successive favorable seasons in western \ebraska for this disease and it has probably increased each year. L n,ler ncrmul dry land conditions the disease will probably never lie of an epidemic nature causing- great losses. Fusarium Wilt and stem-end rot This is a disease with which you are all familiar and which many growers believe is increasing in destructiveness each year. There is no question but that it caused serious losses during the past year and that it is one of the most important potato diseases in many'parts of western Nebraska. There is some doubt in my mind however"regarding •he supposed increase in s el erity in sections where the disease is com - inonly present. I can remember seeing fields seven years ago that were as heavily infected as any field this year. An examination of •-he cert.fication records for the year 1922, 23 and 25 show that while this disease cause many rejections the percentage of rejections does not show successive yearly increases. In 1922 with two field inspec - tions and one in the bin the percentage uf fields rejected for wilt were b per cent, 19 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. In 1923 there were 1 per cent. 5 per cent and 6 per cent rejected while in 1925 with 3 ;ield inspections, 5 per cent, 7 per cent, 13 per cent and 27 per cent were rejected. The greatest amount of infection in rejected fields was in 3922, the percentage dropped in 1923 but was high again in 1925. It would appear then that the yearly variation in the occur - rar.ee of this disease is probably due to a great extent to environmental factors. The work which has been done at Nebraska on this disease shows that in dry seasons affected plants show severe wilt in the field an.i that these plants do not produce many tubers. In seasons with plenty of moisture the wilt symptoms in the field are not so noticeable an., infected plants are able to survive and produce many infected tubers naturally resulting in many rejections for certification when they are inspected in the bin. The sreat concern over this disease is prob - ably due to the variation in the amount of disease in different years an., to the difference in the expression of the disease, i. e. as a severe »"ilt in dry seasons or a &gt;tem-end rot of the tuber in wet seasons. In addition 1 believe- and I am g-lad to see that the growers are more critical regarding diseases in their crop at the present time and are now worried over conditions which a few years ago did not cause them creat concern. The fact still remains that this is a major disease of potatoes in tm&gt; state and that it is not satisfactorily controlled by simply planting - healthy seed. There are also indications that the disease is becoming </seg>
            <seg id="p683">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION more wide-spread in its distribution. The influence of various soil types, cultural methods and crop rotations are not clearly understood. Additional work along these lines is necessary before we can determine the various cultural practices which would tend to keep this disease at a minimum. All diseases which are caused by organisms capable of living in the soil are difficult to control and the problem of combating them is one which would entail a number of years work on different soils and with various crop rotations and tillage methods. It has not been, considered feasible to undertake such work up to the present time. No work of this type has been undertaken in other states except Pen - nsylvania, where they report that wilt is worse on corn stubble or under conditions of poor fertility. • The problem is a local one in western Nebraska however, as results obtained in other sections of the country would probably not be directly applicable to the conditions we must deal with in our dry land sections. Before we close with this disease it might be well to mention the results I have obtained during the past two years in a few variety tests. In these tests alternate. rows of Triumphs, Cobblers and Early Ohio's were planted on ground which had produced an infected crop the previous year. Similar results were obtained both years and are the same as previous results obtained in the greenhouse. Practically no wilt occurred in the field but the tubers were cut and examined individually and were found to be infected. The Cobblers and Early Ohios were about equally infected and the Triumphs only showed half as much infection. These results are quite in accordance with field ex - perience and show that the Cobblers certainly should not be planted in many of our wilt infested soils. The disease is severe enough in the Triumph but is much worse in Cobblers under similar conditions. In connection with these tests it was also found that a treatment with Semesan Bel used after the seed was cut did not prevent infection or reduce the amount of the disease. . . Scab This is another disease which has caused enough loss this summer to create a considerable demand for additional information concerning its control. It probably causes more loss to both seed and table stock potatoes in this. state than any other single disease. You all know that seed treatments can be used to partially control the disease by killing the organisms that are carried on the seed tuber. This subject will be considered in detail tomorrow, and I simply wish to present at this time some of the known facts concerning the disease which may give you a clearer understanding of its occurrence and the problem of its control. No detailed study of potato scab has been made in Nebraska and we are therefore, indebted to workers in other states for much of our information on this, disease. </seg>
            <seg id="p684">KKPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It has been shown by various workers that the potato is only sus - ceptible to the disease during certain stages of its development The organism is only able to attack the tuber through the natural openings in the skin, the lenticels which you have all observed under wet soil conditions as little white tufts scattered over the surface of the tuber. It is only during the early development of these tissues before they become ruberized or corky that 'che organism can enter. This means that the scab develops during the early formation of the tuber or on the new growth when secondary growths as knobs occur. The amount of infection occurring from the soil depends on many environmental factors and also on the number of organisms present which is again dependant upon the other factors which have operated previous to the planting of the potatoes and which have influenced the growth of the organism. Among these various factors can be listed some which have been studied under experimental conditions such as temperatures, moisture, oxygen, and soil reaction, all of which affect both the parasite and the potato plant. It might be well to briefly summarize the effect of the various factors on the disease. Tempera - tures between 60 degrees and 75 degrees are favorable for scab with the greatest amount occurring at about 72 degrees Fahrenheit. The effect of moisture is intimately connected with oxygen supply. When soils are very wet the supply of oxygen is reduced and the organism fails to develop rapidly. Both of these factors, would of course be greatly influenced by the physical structure of the soil and this phase of the subject needs further investigation. Scab is also known to be worse on alkaline soils than on neutral or acid soils. We can now see that all the conditions most favorable for the development of scab are present in western Nebraska and as a result the disease is usually severe. In addition to seed treatments various other means of control have been resorted to at different times and places. In eastern United States where the soils are neutral or slightly acid it is possible by the application of sulphur to the soil to increase the acidity to a point where the organism is unable to develop. Such a control method is obviously impracticable for our highly alkaline soils. In England it has been found that the disease is decreased by turning under a green cover crop. The only tests of this method of control in this country have given negative results and it is questionable whether this practice could be applied in western Nebraska. The rotation of crops has been generally recommended for the control of the disease on the theory that the number of organisms in the soil would thereby decrease materially. A great deal of additional information is needed regarding the effort of rotations and previous crops on the disease. The ideal control method of course would be the discovery of resistant varieties but no great progress has been made in this direction. </seg>
            <seg id="p685">NKKKASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION In studying this problem we are chiefly concerned with methods of influpticing the period of susceptibility of the plant by cultural practices, date uf planting or other methods and with methods of decreasing the numbers or activity of the organisms in the soil by crop rotations, soil treatments or . cultural practices. The solution of this problem must take all these various factors into consideration and it is only by careful experimental work over a period of years that we can hope to arrive at some method of materially checking this troublesome disease. Virus Diseases I will mention the virus diseases, mosaic and spindle-tuber very briefly. Mosaic has been fairly easy to detect this season due to the cool, wet, weather. I hope you have profited by the opportunity thus afforded to rid your fields of this disease. During such years as this I would like to remind you that the same conditions which enable you to easily detect the disease are excellent for insect transmission and spread of the disease and therefore the earlier you get into your fields and get these plants out. the less disease you will have the following years. . The same conditions which make it easy to see mosaic tend to mask the symtoms of spindle-tuber especially in plants recently in - fected. High soil moisture, however, emphasizes the symptoms in the tubers so that the disease was easy to detect in the bin. Under these conditions we can expect to find more spindle-tuber in the bin than was indicated by field inspections. We have recently found that what we had previously called severe spindle-tubef is in reality a separate and distinct disease now called unmottled curly dwarf, and is more easily transmitted than the milder form. Plants infected with this severe form late in the season are hard to detect but will produce very dwarfed plants the next year with practically no set of tubers. It is the same general type of disease as spindle-tuber and I mention it chiefly to impress upon you the im - "portance of removing: this type of plant from your fiefd early in the season. We have also found that both unmottled curly dwarf and spindle - tuber can be transmitted by grasshoppers as well as by aphids. This is probably a factor in the rapid spread of the disease in the Platte Valley where grasshoppers are often plentiful. There is a great pos - sibility that there are also other insects capable of transmitting spindle-tuber. In regard to transmission by cutting knife and contact of freshly cut seed pieces we have found that if a healthy seed piece is brought into contact with a spindle-tuber seed piece or cut with same knife are </seg>
            <seg id="p686">liKli.KT (IK SKBHAHKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE planted immediately the disease is transmitted, but if they are allowed to dry thoroughly before planting only a very small percentage of in - lection occurs. In conclusion I would like to emphasize a point in growing seed potatoes that is beinq; somewhat neglected in recent years. I refer to the use of a seed plot which can be rogued very severely and used for the planting of the commercial field the following year. This is cheaper than having to buy a new foundation stock every few years and aiso decreases materially the amount of roguing necessary in the commercial field. This cuts the amount of hand labor and therefore the cost of raising seed potatoes and increases the quality of the pro - duct. Such methods are necessary if we are going to produce certified seed potatoes on a large scale. HOW CAN WKSTERN NEBRASKA CERTIFIED SEED BE IMPROVED H. 0. WERNER, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebr. The general quality of Nebraska certified seed potatoes is very high. In fact probably no place else in the United States can there be located nearly as many lots of Triumph seed of equal disease freedom and productivity. During each year since potatoes were first certified in Nebraska there has been constant improvement in the quality of the seed. The general average of quality is much higher than it was, say four or five years ago. The most distinctive perceptible advance during that time has been the practical elimination of mosaic from certified stocks, especially so rugose mosaic. Rejections for certification, however, still run rather high some seasons. The variations in seasonal climatic conditions have much to do with the percentage of rejections. Some seasons tend to mask mosaic while others provide very favorable conditions for bringing out the symptoms. The same is true of spindle-tuber and unmottled curly dwarf. Likewise some seasons are more favorable for the spread tif these diseases than are others. In the case of diseases caused by bacteria or fungi— such as scab, rhizoctonia, and fusarium, the preva - lence and severity is ven directly correlated with weather conditions. However, in spite of all these facts much can be done to maintain the quality of the seed stock and thus insure certification, and many things can be done that will bring about measurable improvement. Those who are interested in the future of Nebraska certified seed potato industry realize that we cannot stand still but must strive con - stantly for improvement. Increasing competition is one reason, the other is,— that commonly the industry that stands still soon is actually declining. </seg>
            <seg id="p687">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION" ■ We shall consider some things that can be done and then see who should do theni. We should also study the present market requirements and see which are of greatest importance and which are of no signi - ficance so far as, productiveness of seed stock are concerned. . Seed Potato Production Methods It will be well for us to critically observe our present methods — with the hope that we can find some place wherein improvement can be made.' We must remember at all times that we should also decrease . production costs as far as possible, consistent with maintenance v&gt;f high quality. In this connection it is of importance to realize that prac - tically all cost of production studies with " potatoes have shown that when costs per- acre are increased, with intelligence, the costs per bushel decrease, due to better yields. The Problem of Foundation Seed Stocks The use of a very good grade of seed stock is the first requirement with a certified seed potato producer. . Indifference in that regard is inexcusable and commonly brings disastrous results. Not every lot of seed potatoes which is good enough to meet certification requirements is . good enough fur the seed grower to use. The certification require - ments are designed to provide seed potatoes that are capable of pro - ducing a good commercial crop in the southern seed buying districts. , As these regions do not use their own potatoes for seed purposes they, can use stock with a higher disease count than can the northern seed grower, for they do not need to reckon with the consequences of virus disease spread and its effect on the following crop. With the seed .giower the best is none too good. The established seed grower frequently finds it not desirable but absolutely necessary to change his seed stock if he is to stay in I the certification business. The grower will do well to secure a better lot of seed whenever the disease content of a lot of seed is close to the limit allowed for certification, especially if such lots required much roguing to meet the requirements. It is difficult to reduce the amount of disease in such Jots, so that much roguing is constantly necessary. Seed stocks should also be renewed when conditions have been - favorable for the spread of disease. Some *&gt;f these favorable condi - tions for the spread are brought about by early planting, or any con - ditions which stimulate heavy vine growth, such as abundance of mois- I ture or fertility, or the presence of many insects such as plant lice and j grasshoppers, which are known to spread the disease, and others which { . . probably act as carrying agents. We have experimental data to show </seg>
            <seg id="p688">KKl'OKT «&gt;K NKBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE that spindle-tuber spreads mure rapidly in the low wet places of a field than on the dry hill tops. We have also found that when conditions are very favornl le for disease spread the spindle tuber content may increase from 2 or 3 percent to more than 10 percent the following; year. Early ami thoroue-h rojruinjr will be of much assistance but frequently is inadequate to keep down rlisease, due to symptom masking and spread before !\&gt;sruinp. Cruwer.- having such conditions— especially irrigation growers— will di ivcll to renew their seed stock frequently. The very best lots of seed should be used. Merely changing seed siock- is not sufficient. To be suitable for use as foundation seed stock a lot of seed should have a very low disease content, that is, les-t than a total of 2 percent of all serious .diseases such as mosaic, fusarium and spindle-tuber. Furthermore, it will -be well if the seed stock was produced in a relatively isolated place. It should have been rogrued early and thoroughly. It shwild have been produced in a region known tvi be unfavorable for the spread of disease. What Should the Seed Grower Have a Right To Expect from a New Lot of Foundation Seed? In connection with some phases he may be over critical, in others not sufficiently critical. He has a right to expect low virus disease content, espeeiall&gt; so with mosaic which has practically been eliminated from some lots. Because spindle-tuber is more difficult tv&gt; detect with certainty a little more latitude may need to be allowed with it. The stock should als\) be free from fusarium wilt. Some Things Are of Little Consequence So Far As the Productive Value of the Foundation Seed Stock Is Concerned One of these things is the size of the potatoes. The shape is of little consequence as long as one it certain,— from field readings, that the poor shape is not due tv&gt; spindle-tuber. Common scab and rhizoc - tonia. since they can be eradicated by seed treating, should not be taken too seriously with a lot of seed that might otherwise be nearly perfect. Some things that cannut be guaranteed in the crop raised from foundation seed are:— freedom from diseases that may come from the soil, such as scab, rhizoctonia, and fusarium; also one cannot be sure that the .-rock will pass certification requirements without roguing. This might happen the first year but is not certain after that. </seg>
            <seg id="p689">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION MARKET REQUIREMENTS FOR SEED POTATOES The market which absorbs the Nebraska Certified seed potato crop has developed a series of fairly definite demands. These demands are based more upon the appearance than upon other factors which actually influence performance. The principal factors are the follow - ing: — 1. Amount of virus and other diseases. .2. Shape of tubers, knobs, growth cracks, etc. 3. Color of tubers. 4. Freedom from cuts, rots, frost, or other injury. 5. Eye and sprout characteristics. 6. Degree of maturity. 7. Place where seed potatoes were grown. . 8. Cultural methods used, — whether irrigated or dry land. 9. Soil upon which potatoes were produced. 10. Source of seed or strain. Some V)f these factors are of considerable importance from the standpoint of the productivity of the seed potatoes. Other factors are based more or less on fanciful relations, or are the carry over of some discredited or obsolete idea. We shall attempt to discuss each of these, pointing out which factors are of significance . and which are not very important. It is well for the potato grower in the north to cater to the ' market demands as much as is necessary. It is however also advisable for him to have an appreciation of the facts which influence quality of seed potatoes . Frequently potatoes which cannot be sold to critical southern buyers are of sufficiently good quality to permit their use as seed stock in the. north. Virus disease's.— Spindle-tuber reduces the yield and injures the market grade, in that more small potatoes and more poor typ e potatoes are produced. The buyer is amply justified in being critical with re - gard to potatoes infected with this disease. Potatoes discarded • . because .of spindle-tuber should by no means be planted. Mosaic may not injure the type of the potatoes but will reduce the yield materially. Stome of the very mild types of mosaic may not be very injurious to the yield but it is well to eliminate such stock as rapidly as possible. Fungus diseases-Fusarium wilt causes . a poor stand, is frequently responsible for the rotting of the seed pieces, and may account for many of the weak plants occuring when infected seed has been I planted. Rhizoctonia reduces the stand, decreases the yield and tuber size. It can be controlled by seed treatment and buyers need therefore not be very critical so far as it is concerned. </seg>
            <seg id="p690">KKPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Common scab is a serious problem in western Nebraska. The disease can be controlled by seed treatment,— that is the disease which is on the seed potatoes can be destroyed. When judging potatoes with regard to shape it is important to have a g-ood understanding- concerning the factors which affect shape. Generally buyers discriminate against somewhat elongated potatoes on the assumption that such elongation may be due to spindle-tuber. Their critical attitude in this connection is commendable but it may go too far. Tuber elongation is brought about by several factors such as high temperature, heavy soils, hard soils, high soil moisture content, and relatively early planting. It has been shown repeatedly that tubers elongated because of these conditions are as productive as the better type tubers from the same field when spindle-tuber is not present. Furthermore if the abnormal shape is due to growing conditions and not disease the tendency will not be transmitted to the next crop of tubers. Knobby potatoes are frequently objected to. Knobbiness, how - ever, is no indication of lack of vitality. In some of our experiments we have noted that lots of potatoes that had very little spindle-tuber may have had relatively high percentage of knobs. This is probably due to the fact that the diseased tubers were produced on plants that were too weak to resume growth after a period of unfavorable weather. The color of the tubers is generally the result of environmental conditions. A fairly intense red color seems to be preferred in the case of Triumph potatoes. Such coloring is favored by moist soils, heavy soils, and low temperature; when conditions other than these prevail the tubers are very likely to be lighter in color. It must of course be understood that the spindle-tuber disease may cause a decidedly lighter color, but that when the disease is present, infected tubers can generally be distinguished by the shape or eye characteristics. Tubers with strong- vigorous eyes are preferable to those with weak eyes. Deep eyes are also preferable, however, since light soils will commonly produce rather shallow eyed potatoes wne should not be too critical on this point. Strong sprouts are very much to be preferred. There is a fairly general belief that immature potatoes are better than mature seed potatofs. Our experiments indicate that when di - sease is present the seed potatoes that are in the field for the shortest period of time are the best, due to the fact that they have had less opportunity to become infected. This is especially the case with the spindle-tuber disease. When disease is absent there is very little dif - ference in the performance of the potatoes representing different de - grees of maturity. In case the potatoes are very immature when harvested it may be very difficult to store them without suffering serious losses. Sometimes very immature seed is physiologically un- </seg>

There is also some relation between the decree of ma - turity and the time and rate of sprouting. The buyer is pvobably quite justified in insisting upon seed pota - toes being free from cuts, rots, and frost injury. In 1927 certified seed crop the percentage of cut and bruised potatoes varied from 4.4 per* - cent to 55 peicent in the case of different lots. The keeping quality of injured rutatoes is very uncertain, depending upon the speed with which the cut potatoes heal and the degree of infection which has occured before healing commences. No .one will question the damage done by frost when potatoes break down ar.d show distinct injury, however, considerable injury may be done the eyes of relatively immature seed potatoes. More needs to be learned abcut Ibis question. Growers will do well to give the matter of protecting against frost somp very careful thought. The injury caused by (lea beetles injures the appearance v&gt;f the potatoes and uninformed buyers will suspect such potatoes as being Fcr.bby. It is r.ot likely that the seed quality of such potatoes is injured by the flea beetles unless spindle-tuber was present. In that case there might be danger of disease spread. The place where the seed potatoes were grown may be "of conse-. eiuence if disease is present in the field, but does not scum to be of much consequence if virus diseases are not present. In some regions some of the- native plants may be carriers of diseases. Once it is proved that such is the case there would be a basis for an opinion on place affect. Cultural conditions are or are not significant according to the prevalence of virus diseases. In the case uf entirely healthy stock, irrigation or dry land culture does not appear to be a serious factor, however, due to the more rapid spread under irrigation spindle-tuber becomes more serious there than in the case of most dry land grown fields. . ■ The soil exerts a distinct effect upon the shape and color of the potatoes but it does not seem to affect the yielding power when seed stock is healthy. There are a. number of things-that a grower can do to improve his seed stock. He can secure the. very best foundation stock available. He can grow such seed stock in an isolated place and keep it free from disease. He can also rotate his crops so that his land will not be - come infected as readily as might be the case without rotation. Treat - ing the seed potatoes with hot formaldehyde to kill all surface borne diseases will be of considerable value. The more progressive growers </seg>

Nevertheless, the formula is effec - tive. Potato grown are in. doubt the worst "question askers" of any class of farmers. Maybe wo should say the best "question askers.'' Anyhow, it wn that the&gt; ask more questions than most anyone. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they have a largo investment and feel that they must know all abuut potatoes to make a success of growing and marketing them. Whether or not this is the reason, the fact remains that they are in the habit of asking questions, and this tact lias led to the revival of the potato industry in the Kaw Valley. Potato growers have been in a large measure responsible for the rapid development of experiment stations and research work. Only a few years ago our departments uf horticulture answered all the ques - tions about potatoes. But now we have questions that the horticul - tures turn over to the pathologists, bacteriylogifrts, physiologists, and economists. It onl) takes a two-cent stamp, a sheet of paper, and a "lVwnteil at Lincoln mooting, January 4, ]!)28. </seg>
            <seg id="p693">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION few minutes to ask a question, but it often takes a thousand dollars ' and considerable time to answer the question. The potato grower is not satisfied with an answer to Ms letter, he wants an answer to W s ques - tion. This fact has been responsible for the development of scientific /principles in potato production. Prior to 1916, the Kaw Valley produced an average of 100 bushels of potatoes to the acre. This was not a big yield by any means, but the growers were fairly well satisfied for this hundred bushel average included fields that -yielded as high as 300 bushels and some that yielded only 50 bushels. However, during the next few years the average yield" fell below 100 bushels, in fact, the average was only 88.4 bushels per acre. That something: was wrong- was apparent, but just what the trouble was the growers were at a loss to determine. They began to ask questions and sent for men at the college to go over the situation with them. It was determined that potato diseases were responsible for considerable loss, and steps were taken to conduct experiments to determine whether or not this loss could be checked. One of the larger growers, Mr. M. 11 Kilsey at Topeka, offered his land, equipment, and assistance to test various methods fbr the control of potato diseases. In 1918 the first experiments with seed treatment were conducted with the result that an increase of 60 bushels per acre was obtained. The method used was the cold corrosive sublimate treatment. This was only one year's results and definite recommendations could not be made, but the growers who saw the results were anxious to try the treatment and the next year 500 acres were planted with treated seed. That year, 1919, an average increase of 40 bushels per acre was obtained by seed treatment. The next year, 1920, the acreage in treated seed was doubled and from that time on the acreage in treated seed increased until today over 85 percent of the acreage in the Kaw Valley is planted with treated seed and the practice of seed treatment is well established. The method has changed to a large extent, however, for most of the growers now use the hot-formaldehyde method instead of the cold cor - rosive sublimate method. This consists of using two pints V)f formalde - hyde to 30 gallons of water, heating the solution to 124 to 126 degrees Fahrenheit, and soaking the potatoes in this solution from three to four minutes. Fall or early spring treatment while the potatoes are dor - mant has proved better than treatment just before planting. The seed treatment methods were the result of scientific investiga- • tion. They were adopted after careful trial. They were worked out in the laboratory and the field. Credit should be given the men who were responsible. Not one experiment station but several had a hand in the work. The hot-formaldehyde method was discovered by Dr I E Melhus of the Iowa State College. </seg>
            <seg id="p694">KKI'OKT I IK XKHIi.xSKA STATE HlUKU OK AORICTf/rrRK The establishment of the principle of seed treatment was the first step in the revival of the potato industry in the Kaw Valley. The next step was the application of the principle through organized effort Those growers who had an opportunity to witness the original ex - penments were quick to adopt the practice. Seeing is believing, and those who saw were convinced of the value of the practice But what about the other growers who had not heard of the treatment, and those who may have heard about it, but who felt as though it was some wild scheme or a piece of imagination? It is recorded that the first promoter of the telephone was arrested as a swindler. Who would be - lieve it were possible to hear another's voice over a wire? Potato growers who had grown potatoes all their lives were skeptical about a treatment that would increase the yield from 40 to 60 bushels per acre. Who could blame them? Here is where organized effort played its part. The county agents called meetings, a specialist from, the agri - cultural college gave demonstrations, and test plots were arranged in the various counties in the Kaw Valley. During the growing season, tours were conducted and the test plots visited. At digging time records were taken on the test plots, and the results were given to the growers by the county agents. These tests have been conducted every year. At present they are conducted to check new methods against the old and establish methods. The growers watch them carefully and critically. If there are better methods than those used at present, they want to know. r Seed treatment has been only one of the methods adopted to im - prove the potato industry. Other methods that have been adopted include the use of legumes in the potato crop rotation, the use of better seed, improved methods of insect control, and better marketing methods . Land is hish priced in the Kaw Valley and consequently potato grower* are anxious to grow potatoes as frequently as possible The question of a proper rotation has been given considerable attention, ine first tests conducted were to determine the relative value of leguminous and non-leguminous crops. The result was as expected The leguminous crops proved far more valuable than the non-leguminous crops in the rotation. But this did not answer the question concerning the value or the land and the profitableness or unprofitableness of con - tinuous potato production. Some growers have built their farm opera - tions around potatoes to such an extent that they have little use for feed crops and consequently are not interested in a long time rotation that will leave out potato production for more than a year. Other grow - ers have use for feed crops and pasture. Consequently, they can afford lo adopt a rotation that includes alfalfa and sweet clover. </seg>
            <seg id="p695">NEBRASKA POTATO rMPROVEWE.VT ASSOCIATION' T'he use of alfalfa and sweet clover has increased to a large extent among Kaw Valley growers. Preference is given to sweet clover when the grower can utilize it for pasture. Alfalfa is chosen if a hay crop is needed while some growers sell it as a cash crop in case they do not feed it. Sweet clover has, however, proved to be the quickest soil builder and has improved the quality of the potato to such an extent that it is replacing alfalfa to a considerable extent in the potato rotation. It is used satisfactorily by some growers who do not wish to leave the land out of potatoes for more than one year. Those growers who are not practicing a year to year rotation are using .a "one year rotation". This consists of the use of a green manure crop between potato crops. As soon as the crop. is harvested soybeans or cowpeas are sown. These are turned under just before frost and then wheat and winter vetch are sown to grow during the winter. In case the crop is dug too late to seed soybeans or cowpeas, the wheat and winter vetch are sown in the fall. This has proved satis - factory in most cases and "where practiced, a profitable crop of potatoes has been produced every year. Commercial fertilizers have been tried, but they give little or no increase jn yield. This is contrary to the situation in most potato pro - ducing sections. Chemical analysis shows .that Kaw Valley soils con - tain the elements necessary for potato production in abundance. This, together with scant precipitation during the growing season which would fail to make commercial fertilizers available, perhaps accounts for the lack of response to the application of commercial fertilizers in the. Kaw Valley. On the other hand, the use of green manure crops, which makes plant food elements available, may tend to obscure the effect of commercial fertilizers. The seed situation has been the subject of a great deal of dis - cussion in the Kaw Valley. Someone has said that the three funda - mentals of potato production are the soil, the seed, and the man. That seed is important is well recognized, but the problem of securing good seed is a difficult one. The Kaw Valley is dependent upon northern sections for its seed supply. Home grown potatoes do not yield as well as northern seed. There is too great a loss in vitality between the time the Kaw Valley ciop is harvested and the next crop is planted to use the home grown crop for seed. A second crop to be used for seed is satisfactory if it can be raised, but the lack of rain fall during August and September does not favor the production of. a second crop more than two years out of five. Consequently we are dependent on the northern sections. Seed certification in the northern sections has ultimately solved the seed problem for us. In this connection it must be emphasized that </seg>
            <seg id="p696">REPORT OF .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE the word ultimately was chosen deliberately. When seed certification was first attempted in the northern sections, the Kaw Valley growers were eager to get it. In fact, in Shawnee county, in 1921, over 75 percent of the acreage was planted with treated seed. Seed certifica - tion appeared to be the solution of the seed problem. But it was discovered that seed certification was far from perfect at that time 6ome growers must have run out of seed before their supply of tags was exhausted. Some of the seed that was shipped to Kansas was not first class table stock. Results of course were disappointing and as a consequence, certified seed received a "black-eye". In checking the matter with the northern inspectors it was learned that certification was then an experiment and the difficulties involved were tremendous. The most careful growers had not been determined, and the rules and regulations of certification were subject to revision. Then some remarkable discoveries took place. Professor H. 0. Werner of the Nebraska Experiment Station determined that there was a potato disease known as spindle tuber that was responsible for reducing potato yields. He carried a few specimens in his packet and told us how it looked in the field. We began to investigate. The next time we held potato meetings the growers came to the meetings with their pockets full of spindle tubers. They planted some to see what the result would be. Just as Professor Werner stated, the yield from these tubers was only from a third to a half as large as the yield from healthy seed. To our surprise it was found that some lots of seed carried as high as 30 percent infection, which you can realize is a serious situation. The solution to the problem has not been completely solved and we are still asking Professor Werner and Doctor Goss many questions about spindle tuber. The most promising control method for Kaw Valley growers appears to be the location of seed that is free from the disease. Many of the Kaw Valley growers go to the northern fields after their crop is harvested and inspect the fields to determine the absence or presence of spindle tuber and other diseases. Their ex - perience, however, has shown that the most careful northern growers are entering their fields for certification and in order to secure the best seed they must rely on the certified growers. Furthermore, since the diagnosis of the spindle tuber disease, certified seed that has been tested in the Kaw Valley has given much better results than it did R-hen it was first introduced in the valley. Reports from potato grow - ers indicated that they purchased enough certified seed this fall to plant one-fourth of the entire Kaw Valley acreage. The use of certified seed appears to be the solution of the seed problem. Increasing dif - ficulties in potato production have made the line between good potato growers and poor ones more distinct. The growers who take the pains </seg>
            <seg id="p697">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION and trouble to rogue their fields and follow the other practices neces - sary to produce good, seed realize the situation and are being rewarded by better prices through certification. That there is a demand for the seed is shown by the bogus "certified" tags that have been used by unscrupulous dealers. One must be sure that the certification is genuine and bears the stamp. of the proper authorities. The matter of varieties has been important in the Kaw Valley. Ten years ago, the Early Ohio was planted to the exclusion of most other varieties. Today, fully 90 percent of the acreage is in Cobblers. The Triumph is not grown on a commercial scale, chiefly because the Kaw Valley is subject to late spring frosts. If the Triumph freezes to the ground after the plants are six to eight inches high, the crop is small, while the Cobbler will recover to a large extent and make a good crop. In fact in 1924 a record crop was produced in spite of a killing frost in May. The Kaw Valley growers did not stop with improvements in pro - duction. They tackled the marketing problem as well. Prior to 1920, a 2,000 carload movement was the maximum. Since 1923 the shipments have ranged between 3,600 and 4,500 carloads annually. It will be of interest to note that the average yield in the Kaw Valley is now 110 bushels per acre as against 88.4 when potato improvement wfcrk was started. This in itself created a marketing problem. Besides, increas - ing competition from other sections confronted them. Consumers be - came more particular. It was necessary to seek more distant markets. What to do was a problem. It was no secret that Kaw Valley potatoes had been shipped with little attention given to grading. Distant mar - kets were not anxious to take on an unknown product. The only mar - ket open to the Valley was largely a speculative one. Dealers who bought Kaw Valley potatoes bought them with the hope that the mar - ket would rise and then they could sell them to someone at a profit. Rejections were the order of the day. A shipper expected a request for a price reduction if the market declined. To meet the situation the Federal Inspection Service was adopted. Shawnee county began ir. 1923 and the service was extended to the entire valley in ]924. The potatoes were graded according to United States standards and a certificate was attached to the bill of lading showing the quality and grade. This resulted in better prices, fewer rejections, and a stimulation off. .o. b. sales. However, the grading - and inspection service was discouraged by certain dealers who preferred to speculate. They were not anxious for the growers to know the quality of their product and were afraid that the inspection certificate in the hands of the grower would give him a wider market which might eliminate them. In some districts the growers did not take up the in - </seg>

They realized the advantages tf a standard product however, and secured the passage of a compulsory inspection law. This law went into effect in 1927. The compulsory inspection law applies to carloads shipped between June 15 and September 1. This usually covers the Kaw Valley shipping season However, this year approximately one-third of the movement took place after September 1 because of heavy rains during the usual digging period. It is important to note that after September 1 when the compulsory inspection service went out of effect, that 98 percent of the movement was inspected 'on a voluntary basis. This is perhaps the nest test that could be given the inspection service. It shows that the growers and shippers realize its value. Branded sacks have been used to a large extent in selling Kaw Valley potatoes. During the past season approximately 85 percent of the crop moved in branded sacks. Leading and grading sheds are beinjr used to advantage in some districts. These are increasing in number each year. Growers and shippers who have grading sheds are making a practice of even-weighting their sacks. The demand for an even-weight package is increasing- because sales to jobbers on terminal markets are made at so much per sack. Time does not permit a full discussion of the various production and marketing improvements that have been responsible for the revival of the Kaw Valley Potato Industry. It is no doubt quite unnecessary to say that there are many improvements that are still to be made \\e have many problems to solve. The questions are not all answered' In fact it seems that the questions are more numerous. In the field of marketing, potato growers shipping on the mid - season market have a big problem to solve. It appears that the Chicago market dominates the entire mid-season market. It is also ap - parent that Chicago daily prices are influenced to a marked degree by the carload arrivals at Chicago. The fact that the potato crop is not visible as are the wheat, corn, and other staple crops makes it dif - ficult to accurately estimate the total supply. This has led potato dealers to base their actions on present supplies rather than on poten - tial supplies. Thus, particularly during the mid-season market, mar - ket prices fluctuate violently with an increase o r a decrease of receipts at Chicago. Data on which these statements are made were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Potato Association *&gt;f America, in Decem - ber 1927. What can be done about this situation is another question. It will take the cooperation of several potato shipping districts. Just how it can best be accomplished is not clear. One thing is certain, however, </seg>

During this period however, a decided improvement has been made in handling potatoes. One of the radical changes made has been the switch from, early Ohios to Cobblers, the reason for the change has been due to the Cobblers not producing a second growth and not becoming knotty as dx&gt; the Ohios under varied conditions.

            <seg id="p713">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Mr. President: I am glad, you have called upon me for I would like to explain how we distribute the Agricultural funds, because from the things we hear in the office it leads us to believe that a large number of people do not understand. I will endeavor to explain how these funds are distributed and also our authority for doing so. During Mr. McKelvie's administration as Governor of the State he put in operation what is known as the Code Law. While the code law has nothing to do with these funds he did "however place them in the ha^ids of the State Board of Agriculture for distribution. First it might be well to know that there are seven Agricultural Societies in the State of Nebraska that are included in this appropriation of $28,300.00 for the bienium or $14,150.00 each year. These seven associations con - sist of: . 1. Home Economics Association. 2. Nebraska Crop Growers Association. • 3. Nebraska Potato Improvement Association. 4. State Horticulture Society. 5. State Poultry Association. G. Nebraska Dairymen Association. ■ 7. Improved Livestock Breeders' Association. ■: $14,150.00 is handled through our office r $650.00 is used for the handling these funds and making reports, which are checked and proof read. This year for -the first time we felt that there should be established as what is known as Organized Agriculture in the western part of the State for this reason: We find the winter meetings at Lincoln which were held a week ago, a very small percent from the western part of the state were represented, and we feel for the benefit of the people in the western part of the State, we should use $1,000.00 for Western Organized Agriculture. I might say when Gov. McKelvie did this, he instructed our Board that there was no particular amount set to any organization. Of the $14,150.00 we distributed them as follows: The ■ Improved Breeders Livestock Association, $1500.00. They carry on organized agriculture at the College in the winter, they send judging teams to Chicago and other points of Nebraska and secure speakers for meetings. Home Economics receives $500.00. This is used throughout the state, also for speakers and has been very successful with their work. Nebraska Crop Growers, $1500.00. Used in traveling over the state treating wheat smut and certifying potatoes, field work in general. </seg>
            <seg id="p714">KK1M.HT i.K NKBISASK.X ST.XTK BO.MU) OF A-ORtCULTURK State Dairy Association, $1500.00 used for prizes, winter meetings, nave speakers etc. Nebraska Potato Improvement Association, $1,000.00 Used for prizes and field work, doing a splendid work. State Horticulture Society, $1250.00, offer prizes, winter meetings and do a great deal of field work, mostly in the southern part of the State Poultry, §1500.00, carry on the State Poultry Association work, poultry- shows, and get as much as any other association. ?250 00 is &gt;.t aside of this total for my expense to travel on, as I am called out many times for meetings. I don't use a dollar unless I go out to I some Association meeting and I have spent S75.00 of this amount •M ,o.00 was used for delegates to Canada last summer. The State Board of Agriculture is behind the State Poultry Associ- " I ation to the fullest extent and we are doing all that we possibly can. A report about the coops that burned was given. The coops had been loaded the day before and stored in the warehouse, which was burned down, including sixteen trucks, eight horses and other material fortunately these coops were insured any place in Nebraska and will be replaced, so that the Association will not suffer any loss. Mr. Redditt spoke about the State Poultry Association not bein* represented at organized agriculture and that more should be done in the future. Mr. Knudsen, Secretary of the Association, then explained that the State Poultry show as so near at hand and officers in different lo - calities, that it was impossible to work up a program for the Organized Agriculture. Mr. Earle Smiley presented a letter received from Dentz Holcomb of Clay Center, Nebraska, Secretary of the Nebraska Poultry Improve - ment Association, organized in the interest of all phases of Poultry Industry, and this letter refers to an egg-laying contest that may be sponsored by the State Association, and have some one chtjck up the record once a month by some one and make it an official record, as it is anticipated that some of the hens or pens may make a woHd record Copy of letter as follows: At various times, the Nebraska State Poultry Assoc ation has appointed committees to work up an egg-laying contest for Nebraska 1 believe that you were on this committee one year. I was appointed on such a committee -a year ago last State Fair time. We are now having an egg-laying contest that may be sponsored by the State Associ - ation. ' . </seg>
            <seg id="p715">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION We first investigated the laying contest being conducted at Sutton, Nebraska. We found that the manager a good, straight-forward man who was deeply interested in chickens and also willing to give his en - tire time to the matter. He has been found competent with poultry. As soon as we found the contest could be moved to Clay Center where it could be properly supervised, we made arrangements and located it here. The time was short, we had to waive preliminaries and get down to business quickly. We got the sanction of the president of the Nebraska Poultry Association, Mr. C. D. Tharp and have retained the "The Nebraska Official Egg-Laying Contest." The entries this season are not large in number for the reason that the time was so short to make preparations. The number of entries, however, for the present are satisfactory. The hens, as you know, are of good quality. You are aware of this since you scored them. We have just sent out the first month's report on this contest and you wil find a copy herewith enclosed. We are giving the owners the privilege of replacing their disqualified pullets. One of hens in the contest this month is very favorable as compared with the report of year ago. As secretary of the Nebraska Poultry Improvement Association I have written to the members of the Board of Directors of this Asso - ciation and have obtained the sanction of approval from all to sponsor this egg-laying contest as an association. What we are thinking of now is that should some of the hens or pens make. world records in this contest, such records should not be questioned but authentic. We are expecting to give these hens the very best cave and hope that they will make records either this year ov some succeeding year to make Nebraska proud. We want the records auth - entic. We are open to any suggestions the Association may have to offer. It occurs to me that a representative should check up on our con - test once a month by running the trap nests a day each month. This is being done in other states and begets our confidence. Will appreciate your taking this up with the Nebraska Poultry Association if you will do so. We solicit your hearty co-operation. Very truly yours, (Signed) Dentz Holeomb Motion was made and seconded that Mr. Holeomb secure some one in the county or in the state, or a representative of the CColege of Agri - culture to make these necessary check's to bring about an official record of the ugg-laying contest </seg>
