From the Writings of Horace Mann A patriot is known by the interest he takes in the education of the young. Education is our only political safety. Outside of this ark, all is deluge.

Presentation Each contributor to thb Thirty-Fourth Biennial Report has made his statement in the consciousness of field conditions. In our treatment of the problems and affairs of public education we have kept before us the people we are privileged to serve. It has long been the policy in thb Department to be as helpful as possible at the point of contact between teachers and learners.. Accordingly, our purpose is to make this more than a Biennial Report of the State Department of Education. We have striven earnesdy to make clear the educational conditions and needs of our people in the field. I pause at the outset to acknowledge the good work and hearty cooperation of the members of die staff in die Department and all engaged in the cause of public education in the State. Contrary to the disparage - ment of public service in some quarters, officials of the State give themselves patriotically to dieir tasks. Their tasks are arduous, but even more trying than die round of duties is the achievement of progress dirough the efforts of others. I am particularly happy to pay tribute to die teachers of Nebraska, who have carried on nobly in dm period of economic stress and extreme climatic conditions. In spite of limited equipment, low salaries, and odier handicaps, teachers have pushed forward die program for more adequate preparation for citizenship. They have met the challenge of adversity with triumphant determination to succeed. This spirit is die ernest of National recovery. In diis same connection it is in order for each and every one of us in die teaching profession to recognize die heroic element in die homes of Nebraska. Boys and girls are seeking education diese days. They are flocking to school in larger numbers than any previous generation can show. Many of diem are making dieir own way. It is well also for us to recognize the sacrifices of parents for die education of their children. As teachers we are all familiar with die recurring expression of the fadiers and modiers in our communities: "I want my boy and my girl to have a better chance than I have had." </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Thus the ambitions of youth and the longings of parents for the more abundant life bring to us this- challenge to cooperative service in the public schools of our common State. Review of previous reports shows that many problems persist from biennium to biennium. It is encouraging to note, however, in these same reports that records of solutions keep pace with the problems as they arise. Our public schools like our homes and our churches and all the rest of our institutions are of humble origin. The equipment of today is the evidence of unremitting effort from year to year for the improvement of educational opportunity. The philosopher of the Capitol Commission summarizes the progress of our State in these words carved in the stone of the main entrance: "Honor to the pioneers who broke the sod that men to come might live." "Honor to the citizens who build an house of state where men live well." In the sections which follow, attention is specifically called to matters of vital importance at this time. The Report in its entirety is worthy of the careful study of all who have responsibility for the welfare of our people and our State. It is the policy of the Department to enlist cooperation in the study and formulation of legal provisions for the control of the schools. In dealing with the affairs of youth we must all proceed upon the basis of a search for the truth as it will inevitably ccrre to pass. On this basis we can move ahead, confident of a better civilization which is the goal of our public schools. The State Department of Education Centennial of State Departments of Education A century ago Massachusetts established the first permanent State De - partment of Education in America, and the Board of this Department chose Horace Mann as its secretary. Because of his part in the common school revival of the Forties, Horace Mann is called "The Father of the American Public School." Nebraska, in common with many other states of the Union, is deeply indebted to Massachusetts for pioneer work in the field of school administration. The commemoration during this school year of the establish - ment of the Massachusetts State Board of Education, with Horace Mann as its secretary, offers a timely occasion to review the service and support of the State Department of Public Instruction in our own State. Provision in Nebraska The Constitution of Nebraska, in these words, clearly places upon the State die responsibility for public education: </seg>
            <seg id="p013">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "The Legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the common schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five and twenty - one years." To carry out this requirement, the Constitution designates the State Superintendent of Public Instruction an executive officer of the State govern - ment and gives to the Legislature the authority to establish a state depart - ment of education. (Section 1, Article IV). The Legislature has largely delegated the responsibility for public education to die counties, municipali - ties, and school districts of the State and made die State Department of Edu - cation the specific agency for putting its enactments into effect. Provision is made by statute that die State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall decide disputed points in school law and that his decision shall be held to have the force of law until reversed by the courts. It follows naturally from this broad legal authority that die duties of the State Department of Public Instruction are as varied as the needs of the schools throughout the State. The State Superintendent, with the help of his staff and the school people of the State, works out the courses of study for the elementary schools and establishes programs for character education and instruction in the harmful effects of alcohol. In cooperation with the University of Nebraska die State Superintendent publishes die High School Manual. Members of his staff supervise the high school normal training courses and inspect the work. He is a member of die State Normal Board and is also a member and the executive secretary of the State Board for Vo - cational Education. The Bureau of Certification for Teachers and the Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses are divisions of his Department. All State apportionments for the public schools are made in the business office of the Department. These are merely examples of the official responsibilities included in the State administration of public education. Extra-legal Responsibilities In addition to these many requirements fixed by law, die State Superin - tendent and the members of his staff make every effort to sense the difficulties in the operation of die schools. With die counsel of die forces in die field and interested citizens of the State generally, adjustments are planned to meet the changing conditions of the times. Herein effort must always be directed to the future needs of citizenship in the service and development of the State. It is always necessary to keep in mind the fact that work in the schools must find application in the world of tomorrow. Viewed in this larger light public education is, in fact, the chief business of die State and all its citizens—Certainly, die interests of the schools must be as far-reaching as the vision of our National mission. Department Expenditures The cost of operation of the State Department of Education appears in the table of governmental costs included in this division of die Report. Chart </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT . 1 shows the trend and relationship of expenditures in this Department to other departments since 1923. Chart 2 gives corresponding informa - tion for the combined expenditures of the four State educational agencies— State Department of Public Instruction, State University, Four Normal Schools, and State Department of Vocational Education. In presenting this material it is in no respect the intent to reflect unfavorably upon expendi - tures in other departments of government. All branches of public service have carried increased responsibilities in recent years. It is the policy of the State Department to extend cooperation to other officials rather than to detract from the credit due them for patriotic effort. Cooperating Auxiliary Agencies In carrying out die commitments of his office the State Superintendent is happy to recognize the splendid cooperation of other officials of govern - ment and many auxiliary and patriotic organizations. The citizens of Ne - braska interested in die cause of education owe gratitude for the unfailing help accorded to all of die educational agencies by such organizations as the Nebraska State Teachers Association, Parent-Teacher Associations, the Fed - eration of Women's Qubs, die American Legion and die American Legion Auxiliary, die Federation of Labor, die Grange, the Farmer's Union, the various church organizations, and other similar groups. Especially do we acknowledge die splendid service of more than 25,000 citizens who accept trusteeship in die school districts of the State. LOW TAX LEVY The state tax levy is the lowest since 1921, and comparable with any previous levies since 1915, when the Legislature appropriated something over $6,000,000.00 for the biennium. Since the good roads program was started some twenty years ago the state has built nearly 8000 miles of graveled and paved roads at a cost of approximately $100,000,000.00 without a bond issue or a hangover debt, and every mile of road has been paid for during its construction and completion. In addition to the above, the state is in excellent financial con - dition. At the close of this fiscal year, July 1, 1936, the financial report of the State Treasurer showed resources of $21,621,929.68, which includes $13,747,005.70 of permanent school funds and $7,874,924.98 cash on hand and in banks, credited to the various funds of the commonwealth.—State Auditor's Report, 1934-1936. </seg>

            <seg id="p019">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Doe* Our Educational System Need Reorganizing? By J. W. Studebaker, U. S. Commissioner of Education Most of us are convinced that our depression-ridden, war-threatened world needs some drastic reorganization. We have had ample opportunity to experience the horrors of war and the desolations of a world-wide economic depression during the past two decades. The struggle against suicidal war and revolution-breeding economic chaos is the main event for our century.. Practically nothing can be considered apart from this struggle. For, if we fail to solve the war problem and the economic problem, our civilizaton will go down in a whirlpool of chaos and violence, carrying with it the institutions of light and learning. This is no time, if there ever was one, to stand aloof from world prob - lems in trie rarefied atmosphere of pedagogy, as if we educators might play our part simply by teaching the accepted scientific facts such as the multi - plication table, and the undisputed revelations of history. The social issues now before the educational world must not be and cannot be pushed into the background by pretending that problems concerned with teaching methods, administration and school organization, for the kind of educational system we now have, are of paramount significance to educators. First things must be put first if second things in importance are to be put anywhere in the future. For, what shall it benefit us to perfect our edu - cational system so that youth leaves out institutions of learning, prepared to the hilt to do something fine in die world, if the great mass of these trained young people can find nothing to do, and are finally sent to fertilize the battlefields of a new war?. So when we ask ourselves the question, "Does our educational system need reorganizing?" we must preface the answer by raising and dealing with the question, "Reorganizing for what purpose, to what end?" The world has experienced a great deal of reorganization of public edu - cation since 1914. In some countries that reorganization was for the pur - pose of developing centralized agencies for indoctrinating the mass of people with beliefs in the princples or nostrums of political and economic dictator - ships. The leaders in those countries are realists in that they understand the absolute necessity of organizing education according to the patterns of their regimes to the end that it shall contribute to the despotic social organiza - tion they are creating. Having smashed all odier democratic institutions, free speech, free press, and free assemblage, they had to end once and for all the old system of public education which to some extent had promoted freedom of inquiry. Now, that's one kind of reorganzation of education. I am frank to say that I don't think we need that kind. In fact, most Americans are still ready to put up a pretty strenuous fight to keep our country from reaching that stage where the people feel so helpless that they are ready to permit some "Sawdust Caesar" to reorganize things along the lines of the totalitarian state. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT There are some people who believe that the teaching profession should decide upon the correct answers to the problems of our social order, and then unitedly work to indoctrinate youth with those answers. These people would reorganize our system of public education to the end of training for what is called "a new social order." They tell us that teachers and professors must take a stand on the vital issues which confront contemporary civilization and try to secure acceptance of the predetermined solutions. There is a second school of drought on this matter, similar in many re - spects to the "new social order" school. The people of this persuasion want the schools to be used to indoctrinate youth with unquestioning belief in the status quo, for which they have many terms, such as: "the American system," "capitalistic democracy," coined to make it appear sacrilegious to consider ob - jectively certain social or economic ideas. Both of these groups, it seems to me, would like to treat the debatable as U Wf e. "rokkatable. Personally, I do not like either of these purposes for reorganizing education. Neither is consistent with the progress of democracy. The end result of any changes or improvements in our educational system should be a more successful democracy—more successful in enabling our people to accomplish the aims set forth in the preamble of the American Constitution. This is not said in lip service. To me, there is nothing more important than the planning of facilities of public education for youth and adults so that all citizens shall have access to a clear understanding of the vital social, poli - tical, and economic alternatives from which they may choose in deciding the future of our democratic society. To die extent that public education has failed to bring youth and adults to grips with die great issues of our time, it has failed to serve the cause of democracy. To the extent that our educational system has failed the cause of democracy, it needs reorganizing. Now, it must be obvious that our educational system has not thus far provided sufficient opportunities for the masses of people to achieve an understanding of their social problems through free discussion, guided study, and public debate. We must admit that, instead of boldly promoting vitalized study and discussion of current controversial issues in secondary schools, in many places there has been a disposition to avoid diem. For various reasons ir has been considered safer to keep youth busy widi a study of the technical forms of government dian with a study of the current problems which involve die social welfare. While diis policy may be safer for school administrations which like to see things running smoothly with the least of controversy, the sidestepping of vital social and economic problems is decidedly dangerous to the welfare of American democracy. But I'm afraid that our complicated problems will not wait until we can raise up a new generation, trained especially in the critical approach to </seg>
            <seg id="p021">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION public questions. In fact it seems very clear to me that our society has now moved into the stage of its development where civic education in elementary and secondary schools, even for children of the masses, will not be sufficient. At best, formal education through the age of 17 or 18 can provide only a foundation for the essential superstructure of adult civic education. In a democracy that tries to operate in the midst of social complexity, our educa - tional institutions must always be in the process of reorganization, of re - orientation, of readjustment, I think that the greatest emphasis now should be placed on improved organization for adult civic education. I diinfc dus, first, because it is of great importance that those who now vote should have, access to systematic and free discussion of the problems they must deal with; and second because once the adults of our communities have fairly and com - petently managed discussion for themselves, they will want it and will work to get it for their children. Having said that I do think we need some reorganizing of our educa - tional system for the purpose of vitalizing popular government and democratic social organization, let me go on to suggest in bare outline what this reorgani - zation might involve: 1. By reorganization I do not mean that we should set up new or par - allel agencies. We may need to work out some new administrative units for the efficient operation of adult civic education as well as for increasing and broadening educational opportunities for children and adolescents. But so far as the public sponsorship of education is concerned, the existing agencies should be improved and vitalized. I want it definitely understood diat I think the principle of local control should not be minimized by federating or cen - tralizing the management or control of our educational system. 2. Secondly, it is my conviction, from 20 years of experience as a school administrator, that public affairs forums promoted and managed by the local education authorities on a community-wide basis, rural and urban, offer us a practical point of departure in organizing education for an enduring and better democracy. When I say this I do not in any sense depreciate the great importance of vocational education, regular night school classes and university extension courses. I merely recognize the fact that fewer than a million of our 75 million adults are so engaged in special study. And this scant provision for adult learning is not enough to provide self-government with the strong educational base it requires. Nor is this existing system suffi - ciendy concerned with social problems, or geared to the real needs of our democracy for informed citizenship. The masses of people of all classes are now becoming more and more interested in the social issues which affect dieir daily lives. These people can be tied into an educational process, if our educational system is so or - ganized as to permit the masses to go into the schoolhouses and other con - venient meeting places in all the communities of the nation, and diere, with the help of capable forum leaders, carry forward a free and many-sided dis - cussion of public affairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 3. This year the U. S. Office of Education has the opportunity of pro - moting a small beginning toward what I believe must eventually become a carefully planned, nation-wide system of public forums. Ten public forum demonstration centers in ten different states will attempt community-wide pro - grams of adult civic education, with financial assistance from federal relief funds. These programs will be similar to the one which has been operated in Des Moines, Iowa, during recent years. They will employ numerous unem - ployed teachers, librarians, and others in the program. But the forum leaders will be highly trained and specialized persons, capable of giving high caliber leadership to the projects. While federal funds will be used to establish these demonstration centers, local responsibilty and control will be scrupulously ob - served in- the selection of personnel and the determination of the subjects to be discussed. Through publications and in other ways the people of the nation will be informed about the organization, operation, and results of these "experiment stations" for democracy. The forum method, properly managed, is basically educational, and fun - damentally democratic. It develops the willingness to give and take, to ex - change opinions and share information, to respect the rights of others in the expression of honest beliefs. The forum technique, when widely practiced, is an antitoxin again the disease germs of an authoritarian dogmatism. The basic assumption of the public forum is that Truth is not the mo - nopoly of any individual, class or group, but rather the result of a cooperative search and a continuous process of public sharing. As President Wilson so well put it, I quote: "The whole purpose of democracy is that we may hold counsel with one another, so as not to depend upon the understanding of one man, but to depend upon the counsel of all." In these few minutes I have said that I believe our educational system does need some reorganization, and much improvement. I have tried to em - phasize however, the great importance of being crystal clear on the purpose for which we need this reorganization. Anyone who has studied the development of dictatorships must be im - pressed with the tactics which are employed with respect to education. As is - sues become sharper, as the community becomes more divided, and as minor - ities become more fanatical, every sort of pressure is exerted to control the learning process, to intimidate teachers, and to stop discussion. This thing must not happen in America. If we are to prevent it, we must act now in practical ways to revitalize our educational system. The way to do this is to promote free speech and free assemblage as an educational process. If we really believe in democracy, if we believe in the truly American way then we believe that the solution of our great social and economic problems rests with die people. Our obligation as educators is to keep open the lines ot communication and to promote the free and systematic use of every medium or expression to the end that the American people may act in the determina - tion or their future with understanding and intelligence </seg>

            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Public School Finance in 1937 A Continuous Problem Changing economic conditions, progress of the State, and above all else the increasing requirements of citizenship have called for statement and restatement of the issues of public school finance in every Biennial Report of this Department since its organization. It must be said to the credit of the people of Nebraska that they have carried on with heroic devotion to public education through periods of adversity as wc'l as through periods of prosperity. In the present circumstances, loyalty to die youth of the State and the principles upon which our government is founded has never before faced a more definite and far-reaching challenge dian in this year 1937. Broadly speaking the terms of this challenge appear in die "hard times" of this period, the added burdens of taxation resulting from accumulations of federal indebtedness and the program of Social Security, and the require - ments of citizenship when the boys and girls of today take over the res - ponsibilities tomorrow. Recent Trends In common with neighboring states, Nebraska has been hard hit in recent years. Farmers have lost crops, business men have suffered bank - ruptcy, and many workers have been reduced to the humiliation of a relief program. Retrenchment in school and governmental expenditures was in - evitable. The schools responded—costs have been cut to the minimum of operation, while other costs of government have steadily advanced. Chart 3 submitted herewith tells better than words the story of the trends in school 'expenditures as compared to other state expenditures in Nebraska since 1925. To understand the meaning of these reductions in expenditure for edu - cation it is only necessary to look inside the schools of practically any com - munity in the State. In many districts kindergarten work, has been aban - doned, grade school programs have been reduced to the routine of formal studies. Many high schools have dropped homemaking, agriculture and prac - tical courses that fit into the everyday needs of our people and now limit opportunity almost entirely to college entrance requirements. Because of heavy class enrollments teachers are unable to give individual attention to pupils and "recitations" have become the order of the day. Moreover, the instruction is being given by underpaid teachers. The average annual salary of rural teachers in Nebraska is #497.24 for men and $467.93 for women. Compensation for educational service in many cases is below the standards set for relief workers. In spite of handicaps children are coming to school in larger numbers than ever before these days, and teachers are staying loyally by their tasks. During these critical years the service of the schools is outstanding in its spirit of helpfulness and patriotism. </seg>

            <seg id="p028">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Nebraska Has Low Rank The Biennial Survey of Education of the United States Office of Educa - tion supplies the data on expenditures of states for education appearing in Table 1 in this phase of the Report. It will be noted that Nebraska ranked 29th in 1929-30 and ttrd in 1933-34. With the exception of Maine, all states below Nebraska in 1933-34 are southern states which include the lower costs for negro education in the figures given. The costs in Nebraska and in adjoining states in this same year are as follows: Wyoming g 90.79 Colorado 85.57 Iowa 70.87 South Dakota 68.16 Kansas _ 67.42 Missouri 64.00 Nebraska 60.47 Founders Recognized Obligation The founders of Nebraska acknowledged the obligations of the State for the financial support of die public schools in these words of the original Constitution of 1866: "The legislature shall make such provisions by taxation or otherwise, as, widi die income arising from die school trust fund, will secure a thor - ough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state;****" When the makers of the Constitution wrote this provision for State-wide taxation for the support of the common schools they followed provisions of the original territorial law. It is not without significance, however, diat S. D. Beals, die first State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Nebraska, included die following statement in his Annual Report under date of lanuary 1. 1871: "The State Board of Equalization, in making the school tax levy of 1870, have, for the first time, confirmed their action to the peremptory requirements of die statute. They have levied two mills on the dollar of the general valuation of taxable property in the state. It will probably yield to the apportionable fund of 1871 about #75,000. "It is thought by some that the law should be changed, and that the levy should be reduced to one mill on the dollar. Against such reduc - tion there are some grave objections. Nebraska cannot afford to take tank deliberately with the states which are lowest in educational interests and facilities. "// taxes must be reduced, let retrenchment begin elsewhere; let it touch the interests of common school education last." </seg>
            <seg id="p029">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Seven years later S. R. Thompson, the third State Superintendent of Public Instruction made this comment in the Tenth Annual Report: "3. The whole amount of state tax for school purposes apportioned to the different counties in 1877 was #66,684.09. The whole amount from the state fund and other sources was #102,503.79 or #169,287.88 in all. * * * * * "By referring to the summary of statistics it will be seen that from 1874 to 1877, the amount apportioned from the state to the districts steadily increased. In 1878, the amount is somewhat increased, being a little more than 1876, but less than in 1874 and 1875. I am convinced that the reduction of the state tax from two mills to one was a misake. It stopped many schools altogether and discouraged and crippled others. For the considerations urged above, and from a careful study of the results, I am clearly of the opinion that the state tax for schools should be increased at least one-half mill." Present Policy Dates Back to 187S The members of the Constitutional Convention of 1875 erased the re - quirement of taxation for the support of the public schools from the funda - mental law. However, this convention of 1875 made definite provision for the State Board of Commissioners for Educational Lands and Funds, the Governor, Secretary of State, Treasurer, Attorney General, and Commis - sioner of Public Lands and Buildings, to administer all • school lands and funds. Another vital amendment of the Constitution of 1875, remaining in full in the present Constitution, is Section 5, Article VII, which reads: "All fines, penalties, and license moneys, arising under the general laws of the state, shall belong and be paid over to the counties respectively, where the same may be levied or imposed, and all fines, penalties and license moneys arising under the rules, by-laws, or ordinances of cities, villages, towns, precincts, or other municipal subdivisions less than a county, shall belong and be paid over to the same respectively. All such fines, penalties, and license moneys shall be appropriated exclusively to the use and support of the common schools in the respective subdivisions where the same may accrue." Elimination of the Constitutional requirement of taxation for the sup - port of the schools was soon followed by the complete loss of revenue from this source. At present, the obligation of the State is expressed in the follow - ing words of legal rather than financial significance: "The Legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the common schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five and twenty - one years." </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT issues of School Support in 1937 From biennium to biennium the State Department of Education has joined forces with professional and patriotic organizations and citizens of the State in the battle for proper administration of trusts and adequate fi - nancial support of public education. At the present time issues involve: 1. Determination of the claims of the puplic schools to "license moneys arising under the general laws of the State," as provided in the Con - stitution. 2. Provision for sound business administration of funds and resources derived from the federal land grants to the State. (See Special Re - port). 3. Provision for scientific equalization of educational opportunities and burdens. 4. Thorough consideration of the tax basis for the support of public edu - cation. Licenses, Fees and Permit* The first obligation of those having official responsibility in any capacity for school money is the protection of the funds legally committed to them for educational purposes. In this connection attention is directed to the fact that license moneys which, under the Constitution, clearly belong to the schoo's are being diverted to other agencies of the State Government. While the hunting and fishing license is called a "permit" it is by nature and definition a license, involving #130,683.54 in 1935-36. On die same pretext, the license money received in the State Insurance Department is by act of the 1935 Legislature retained for die support of that Department. This fund amounted to #11,936.00 in 1935-36. (Ref. Chapter 44, Art. 2, Section 12, Comp. Statutes Supp. 1935.) Unless die Attorney General should grant that counsel for the State Department of Public Instruction is to be paid out of funds of his office the expense of litigation must fall upon die State Superintendent of Public In - struction personally. This is manifestly unfair. A plan should be developed whereby the costs of final determination of this issue in the Supreme Court are officially allowed. Equalization of Burdens and Opportunities Under provisions of State Aid to Weak Districts the Legislature has recognized minimum standards of educational opportunity for all children since 1907. In addition to the provision of funds for the support of the schools as set forth, the Legislature should give immediate attention to die enactment of a law for die equalization of educational opportunities and burdens in the 7,207 districts of the State. More than forty states have such laws. One- </seg>
            <seg id="p031">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION half of the state pay 25 % of the cost of education. The State Department and our school authorities have long recognized the justice of such provision for the school children of Nebraska. The following statement appears in the Tenth Biennial Report of die Department, under date of December 3, 1878: "There are now great inequalities in die burdens which different dis - tricts have to bear in sustaining the school system. A state tax tends to remove this inequality. The extent of the variation in the amount of tax paid in different districts will surprise any one who has not given attention to the subject. I cite a few examples taken at random from the last reports: In Dodge County the rate of school tax varies in different districts from 2 to 25 mills; in Valley County, from 5 to 35 nulls; in Harlan, from 4 to 25 mills; and in Douglas from 3 to 25 mills. Here we see that in some districts a man will pay on a hundred dollars seventeen times as much as in others. Two farms of equal value lying side by side, but in sparate districts—the owner of one pays six times as much school tax as die other." The financial conditions in these same districts in 1936 are shown in the following tabulations. COUNTY Dlst Xo. High Vuluntlon E« Dlgfc Ko.

Regular appropria - tion for this purpose and other state apportionments may be allocated to an equalization fund. The injustice to taxpayers as well as to children in many districts should be remedied at the earliest possible date. The Department offers its hearty cooperation in the formulation of law for this vital improve - ment in financing the schools of the State. Taxation In so far as taxation for public education is concerned die State De - partment of Public Instruction does not presume to be an authority on forms or sources of public revenue. One splendid virtue of the General Property Tax is that it remains in the hands of the people whose children are being edu - cated. Without a doubt the high proportion of school revenue derived from this source has worked undue hardship upon many homes. Especially is this true in the light of die contribution of homes to our civilization. In 1934-35 approximately 91 % of the school income came from a direct property tax, 57c came from the Permanent School Fund and lands, 7/10 of 1 % from the Federal Government, % of li% from the State government and 3% from fines, licenses, etc. Thus we find that nine-tenths of school costs are borne by direct tax on property in the community. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The State government has already recognized its inability to continue its services through sole dependence on a property tax, and so today, less than 25% of the State government's total income comes from a property tax. The other 75% comes from fees, licenses, permits, grants, gas tax and indi - rect business taxes. While refusing to supplement the property tax with other sources of revenue for schools, our legislatures have none-the-less been doing that very thing for the State government. Because of the complexity and magnitude of the problems involved in the establishment of a fair and adequate system of revenue, the State Depart - ment of Public Instruction hereby joins with many citizens and organizations in recommending to the Legislature that provisions be made for a special com - mission to make a scientific study of the entire structure of assessment and taxation for all governmental purposes. The-Issues Must Be Met The summary of the situation widi reference to school support made in the preceding Biennial Report of this Department is being verified in die experience of this biennial period. This statement follows: "There is ample evidence to show that school board members and patrons throughout the state have been ready and anxious to effect every possible economy in die maintenance of their schools. A report given out by die Tax Commissioner's office shows that die total tax reductions in county, city and town, or local areas, die schools have been talcing the brunt—56 per cent or more dian one-half of die reductions in government tax costs. Further reductions cannot be made if die schools are to continue to function. In view of the gready reduced school budgets now available in die various school districts of die state we desire to state in all sin - cerity diat should die time come when we definitely set out to further curtail school expenditures drastically, just then we as a state and a na - tion start a downward plunge toward oblivion." Chart 4 gives the picture of the trend of school support in recent years. Loyalty to the public schools is accepted as loyalty to children in Ne - braska. In the presence of obligations to posterity and country our people will carry on in the future as diey have in die past. The immediate job is to search out the truth of conditions as they are and make plans for a pro - gram of citizenship worthy of our State and Nation. </seg>

            <seg id="p035">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Administration of School and Institutional Endowments Voters Adopt Constitutional Amendment. At die general election in November, 1936, citizens of Nebraska voted to adopt an amendment to the State Constitution abolishing the office of Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. The count shows 246,682 for the amendment and 210,443 against. The term of the present incumbent, Leo N. Swanson, expires January 1, 1937. Consequently, the incoming Legislature will be required to give immediate attention to a new organization for handling the trust funds and resources of the public schools and institu - tions derived from the federal land grants to the State. Nebraska inherited the constitutional provisions for the administration of her ENDOWMENT MAGNIFICENT from the older states and has re - tained them in practically the same primitive form, diroughout Statehood. Under this set-up, the Board of Commissioners for Educational Lands and Funds was composed of the Governor, the Secretary of State, Treasurer, Attorney General, and Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. (Sec. 1 Article VII.) The Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, whose office was abolished is the Secretary of die Board, (Sec. 72-201) and is required to keep in his office a full and complete abstract of all educational lands of the State of Nebraska and such odier records as are necessary to show die condition of each tract of land from the time titles are acquired by the State. Other statutes delegate to him the appointment of surveyors, draughtsman, deputy, and other members of his staff. In addition to these duties in connection with the administration of the trust funds and resources derived from the Federal land grants he is also custodian of the State Capitol and Capitol grounds. In addition to being a regular member of the Board, the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings is the Executive of the Board for the adminis - tration of school lands. In the same manner, the State Treasurer, who is also a member of the Board, is in charge of permanent school funds and securities. (Chap. 79. Art. 20, Sec. 1.) In effect, the Board itself, as constituted, serves in ex-officio Executive ca - pacity with two of its members, the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings and the State Treasurer, as clerks. The abolishment of the office of Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings offers a timely opportunity to reorganize the administration of these trusts upon a sound business basis. Funds and Lands Include Large Holdings Large and increasing values are at stake as indicated by the following table showing biennial earnings and funds during Statehood. </seg>

From these compilations, it is readily apparent that the public schools of Nebraska have much at stake in the ENDOWMENT MAGNIFICENT. The amount represented in securities and established land values exceeds ,&lt;?36 000,000. The University, the Agricultural College, the State Teachers Colleges also have valuable trusts under the same administration as are the trusts of the public schools. Many States Dissipate Resources Practically every Land Grant State has suffered severe losses dirough the maladministration of its Endowment funds and resources. Following is the account from an official Bulletin of the United States Office of Education: "An incomplete record shows that in 32 of the States, funds totaling many millions of dollars have been lost, diverted, or squandered. In </seg>
            <seg id="p038">36 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 16 States school endowments exist entirely or in part only as unproduc - tive State debts, and in 9 States the funds annually reported as perma - nent endowments are mere fictions, having no existence whatever except on paper. If we confine our attention to the 30 States receiving land grants from the Federal Government we find that in 11 of these the situation parallels that just described. Let us now consider somewhat more in detail these losses and their significance. A sharp line must be drawn between the funds which exist only as State credits or debts and funds which are intact and which represent genuinely productive investments. * * * • As time went on it became more and more evident that the purpose of the Federal Government and of the States alike was to establish perpetual school endowments, the income of which would ease the financial burdens of successive genera - tions. Credit funds and permanent school debts not only fail to do this, but since their so-called interest is commonly paid out of general State reve - nues, they often actually serve as a lever for increasing rather than les - sening the burdens of school support. Funds of this class ought to be frankly labeled as debts; for example, in speaking of the permanent school funds of Illinois, Ohio, and Michi - gan we should refer to them not as permanent school funds but as State debts to the permanent school fund. To do so would clarify matters for all concerned. * * * * The real facts in the case are that in no less than one-third of the States the funds reported as permanent school funds are, from the standpoint of productive endowments, totally or largely mere fictions. In some States, funds once accumulated have been diverted or lost. In other States, such as Michigan, Maine, and Ohio, the State has by legislation adopted a definite policy of using for its own purpose all moneys paid into the State treasury to the credit of the permanent fund and establishing a State debt on which the Commonwealth binds itself to pay interest at a fixed rate to public schools. A study of the present account of State permanent school funds revealed many significant facts. Fifteen per cent of the permanent school fund of Nevada, 18 per cent of the perpetual school fund of California, and 32 per cent of the Wisconsin school fund exist only as State debts. All of Louisiana's surplus revenue fund (United States deposit fund) and 58 per cent of her free-school fund are recognized as permanent State debts by her constitution. The principal of the so-called permanent State school fund is practically a State debt in the following eight States: Arkansas, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Tennessee. * * * * The story told is one of amazing waste of a great national gift. Carelessness, mismanagement, diversion, theft, embezzlement, and land frauds are some of the causes that have played a part in the dissipation of these princely endowments. * * * * </seg>
            <seg id="p039">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Much of the mismanagement and many of the losses were undoubt - edly due to the inexperience of die States receiving these grants, and to their lack of adequate vision of the possibilities of such endowments, and of a proper conception of the purposes of the same. Such a defense can not be made, however, of States which, widi generations of exper - ience continue to mismanage or divert these sacred trusts." "Department of Interior, Bureau of Education, Bulletin 1922, No. 47." Nebraska's record shows the direct loss of $261,000, though official defalcation. "Land Systems and Land Policies in Nebraska".—Sheldon, page 257. This loss has never been made up by the State even though the Constitution specifies that: "All funds belonging to the State for Educational purposes, the interest and income whereof only are to be used, shall be deemed trust funds held by the State, and the State shall supply all losses diereof that may in any manner accrue, so that the same shall remain forever inviolate and undiminished." (State Constitution Article VII, Section 9.) This constitutional provision is the pledge of the State to die Federal Government that granted the lands, and a perpetual guarantee to the children of the State, who are the legal beneficiaries of die grants. But of even greater significance than the funds and the revenues included in Nebraska's ENDOWMENT MAGNIFICENT is the example of integrity in trust ad - ministration on the part of the State. It is worse than useless to teach young people principles of citizenship in classrooms if diey observe maladministration of the funds and resources held in trust for them by their government. The immediate requirement is the establishment of an organization that will conserve and manage die trusts in the interest of the legal beneficiaries in such a manner as will forever reflect credit upon the good name of die State. The heavy responsibilities, which members of the State Board of Commissioners for Educational Lands and Funds carry in the regular offices to which they are elected, do not permit them to give attention to executive duties of endowment administration. Moreover, the tenure of die members is entirely too brief and broken to allow for the formulation and continuity of long time policies. In justice to the values at stake and die members of the State Board of Commissioners for Educational Lands and Funds, it seems advisable to begin at once upon a plan for a Department of Public Endow - ments for the consideration of the Legislature. This task should enlist the serious attention of citizens of the State generally, as well as of the officials in charge. The Department of Education representing the public schools and institutions will be glad to render any assistance possible to this end. Character Education On page 212 appears the report on Character Education. The Super - visor, Mrs. Edna H. Jackson, has quite properly emphasized the institu- </seg>
            <seg id="p040">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT tional phases of the program. It is in order, however, to repeat the assertion appearing in the first Course of Study at the initiation of the Program in 1927: "Community influences are particularly vital in the formation of character in the rising generation.****Citizens of every community by their daily lives are quite as important factors in the Character Education of youth as are the teachers." Without a doubt the most potent of all adult influence is found in of - ficial actions of Boards of Education. None of these actions nor the motives prompting them escape the observation and appraisal of youngsters in the classrooms. They are quick to sense the basis upon which teachers are em - ployed and the supplies are purchased. It could not be otherwise when they must be either the victims or the benefactors of the school program. In Ne - braska, laws respecting these duties exist for the protection of the children, who cannot be heard. (79-411 and 79-2517, Nebraska School Laws). For this reason the most fundamental obligation of school administration is the example of integrity in public service. Insistence throughout the entire Character Education program is upon conduct. The requirement of adults is the same as the requirement of chil - dren with this exception, that adults must assume responsibility for the in - fluence of their actions as well as for the deeds done. The trusteeship of educational opportunity involved in service on die board of education carries widi it die most sacred obligation to community and national welfare. In this larger sense, Character Education is the all pervasive and all inclusive duty of citizenship. Scientific Temperance Instruction Section 79-1409, of the Nebraska Statutes provides as follows: "Provisions shall be made by the proper local school audiorities for in - structing die pupils in all schools supported by public money, or under state control, in physiology and hygiene widi special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks and odier stimulants and narcotics upon the human system." Attention is invited to pages 466-500 of die new Course of Study for Elementary Schools of Nebraska, which include pratical suggestions for teachers as required by the above enactment. This is a vital part of die courses in health education. Believing in die importance of properly training teachers so that they may present scientific temperance instruction, the State Department of Public Instruction has issued a special bulletin for Normal Training courses in high schools. This Bulletin (E-l, Alcohol and Other Narcotics and Their Rela - tion to Health) is predicated upon the belief that the best motive diat can be provided for the pupil is a health motive. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION According to reports, Nebraska spent only #18,000,000 for the educa - tion of her youth and spent #30,000,000 for intoxicating liquor during the first year of repeal. From these conditions it is apparent that many problems confront the schools in making these courses effective. However, the task is ours and we will not shirk it but will continue to instruct die pupils "with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks upon die human system." Present day conditions and modern transportation make it imperative that greater emphasis be given to this instruction than ever before in the history of our State. Dignity and Joy of Work Unemployment in recent years has taught our people die blessing of work. Millions continue to seek jobs in vain, and die right to work has become one of die most urgent demands of die period. In keeping widi diis fundamental requirement of worthy occupation, die State Department of Public Instruc - tion has continued to stress, in all courses of study and all phases of educa - tional opportunity, die dignity and value of labor for the individual as well as for society. The youngsters have caught die spirit of diis emphasis. "The whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like snail un - willingly to school" or "Flogged along die flowery padi of knowledge" be - longed to an older generation. Boys and girls enter into die work of die day with real joy. Widiout a doubt one of die finest contributions of die modern school to industrial and community life will be its "spirit" of indi - vidual and institutional endeavor. In diis same connection die time has come to give a more specific defini - tion to leisure in our school program. Some think of leisure merely in terms of entertainment or worse still merely in terms of "nodiing to do." A more wholesome attitude recognizes high value in moments of freedom from regular school work or vocational duties. We must keep die necessity of work in our educational program, but it is also die duty of die schools to encourage worthy leisure-time activities ranging from a minimum of day dreaming to self-education or study in every phase of human endeavor, whether music, painting, woodworking, hiking, reading, or astronomy. These practical possibilities of leisure, supplement regular occupations, and bring relaxation to mind and body and help mightily toward die achievement of success and happiness. ■ High School Normal Training Program The normal training program was launched in Nebraska high schools nearly diirty years ago. It has functioned continually since that time, furnishing a large majority of die teachers in die rural schools of die State. Recent studies show diat more than two-diirds of die teachers now teaching </seg>
            <seg id="p042">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT in our rural schools are normal training graduates. These people are con - tinually improving themselves by taking advantage of the summer sessions in our state teacher training institutions, the University, and denominational colleges. More than four-fifths of the teachers in the rural schools today have preparation beyond the high school. This preparation runs all the way from six weeks to four years. Many who began with high school normal training now hold degrees and occupy prominent places in the schools of the State. The normal training program definitely centers its whole program around the rural school. Every subject is taught with the idea of preparing young folks for teaching in the one-room rural schools in our State with a knowledge of the conditions as they actually exist. Much attention is given to the planning of schedules, teaching practices, and the development of an understanding of die life in rural communities. It must be clearly understood that the purpose of the high school normal training program from the first has been to supply trained teachers for the rural schools. More than 85,000 are enrolled in these rural schools. The Department stands squarely for die best possible opportunity for the country boys and girls and the homes from which they come. Prosperity on farms means prosperity diroughout the State. For this reason, educational opportunity in the rural communities must be on a par with the best in urban communities. In diis connection it must be remembered diat if rural teachers are to meet the needs of rural communities today diey cannot restrict their service to instruction in the schoolhouses of the district. Parents have a right to expect of them cooperation in the welfare and progress of the community in its entirety. In short, the rural teacher must be more than an employee of die district; the rural teacher must be a friend to the children and a neighbor to die parents of die community. These priceless relationships build good will essential to a good school and a good place to live for everybody in .die community. On diis basis no teachers have larger opportun - ity for service than the rural teachers of Nebraska. This opportunity is worthy of the best and truest in the ranks of the profession. As in all teaching positions the call is for people who in addition to teaching subjects inspire love of learning and worthy character. The^ State Department fully recognizes these requirements of die rural schools, and is willing to change the provisions of die high school normal training program when teachers colleges and odier higher institutions can insure an adequate number of specially trained teachers for the rural schools. It must be borne in mind also that rural teachers, in common with odier teachers, are entitled to ' salaries commensurate to their preparation for service. When better prepared teachers are available and conditions warrant in the State, the Department will welcome a graduated advance in certification standards for all teachers in the public schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ■■■'■. . School Libraries Attention of trustees and school officials is called to the study of school libraries appearing in the Report of the Director of Rural Education, on page 136. In 1,363 districts, with an enrollment of 25,545, the number of books averaged 1.47 per pupil- Four hundred ninety districts listed "no books," and seventy districts stated diat no library books were available. These con - ditions are verified in die findings of die American Library Association to the effect that approximately fifty per cent of the population of Nebraska liv - ing in small towns and country do not have local library service. Our school library law requires trustees to make an appropriation of at least $5.00 per teacher for die purchase of library books, unless "a sum equal to or greater dian this amount is raised by entertainment or odierwise." It should be understood that the provisions of diis law merely recognizes the need for books. In diese days of rapid social change pupils should be en - couraged to read carefully selected books. Accordingly, teachers are urged to cooperate fully in the establishment of library opportunities in every public school. The words of Horace Mann on this subject bear repeating in dus centennial year of his great service to public education in America: "The benefit of libraries in common schools is a modern discovery. But it is one which is destined to increase, almost indefinitely, die efficiency of those schools. . . . Good books are to the young mind what die warming sun and die refreshing rain of spring are to die seeds which have lain dormant in the frosts of winter. They are more, for diey may save from diat which is worse than deadi. sa well as bless widi that which is better than life.—From "Thoughts from die Writings of Horace Mann." Vocational Guidance Note: In these strenuous times boys and girls are finding it increasingly difficult to make satisfactory adjustments to life. Occupations are changing. Many jobs of odier days have entirely disappeared. To help young people effectively under these conditions calls for continuous study of industrial and economic trends and above all else deep understanding and sympadiy with the ambitions of youth. Fortunately in Nebraska, C. A. Fulmer, Director of the State Depart - ment of Vocational Education, has been at work for many years on die problem of Vocational Guidance in our own State I am happy to announce that the findings will be available to school people and citizens generally in a special bulletin of diis Department. </seg>

"That vocational training should receive serious cosidcration in curricu - lum building is obvious."

State Institutions of Higher Learning The State Department of Education freely recognizes common cause in public education with the institutions of higher learning in die State. Evi - dence of this spirit of appreciation and good will appearing in the previous Biennial Report is repeated for emphasis: The University of Nebraska has, over a long period of years, been recognized as one of the outstanding educational institutions in die entire country. It is difficult to place a proper estimate upon die value of die service which it has rendered in training leaders in almost every field of endeavor. Graduates of this institution may be found in positions of leadership in almost every section of die United States and in foreign countries. Any steps that would curtail die sphere of influence which the university now exerts would constitute false economy. The four state teachers' colleges at Chadron, Kearney, Peru and Wayne are recognized as outstanding in their particular field. Thou - sands of young men and young women have been enabled to advance in their chosen professions because of these schools so located as to serve four distinct regions of die state. These schools are to be commended for die courage shown by their leaders and die sacrifices which faculty members have been willing to make during diese trying times. It is to be hoped that they may be permitted to continue their splendid record of service. There can be but little doubt diat die best interests of die state, as a whole, would be served if all die state's institutions of higher learning could be placed under one governing board. Such a plan has been tried in other states with success. Such a plan would permit die setting up of a program which would avoid the present overlapping of work carried on in-the present institutions. Such a plan would permit die setting up^atone institution of an outstanding program for die training </seg>
            <seg id="p046">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT of primary teachers, another institution could be recognized as outstand - ing in the field of training high school teachers, etc. Possibly the time has not yet come for putting such a plan into operation. Church Schools The State Department of Public Instruction recognizes the important part played by the denominational schools and colleges in the educational program of our State. They have made and are continuing to make splendid contribution not only to teacher training but to the citizenship of the State. We recognize the severe problems which they have so courageously faced ■n the matter of reduced incomes both from their endowments and from the* own denominational support. We wish to express the appreciation of the Department of Public Instruction for the good work that has been ac - complished by these schools and the splendid spirit of cooperation evidenced by them in every case. Filing and Reference System For a number of years we had trouble with our filing system. We final - ly came to the conclusion that we would establish a central filing system. lhis made a radtcal change in our departments. As a matter of fact all departments were inclined to object to any kind of central filing system. We employed Sue Herzog and sent her to Chicago for a month, pav - ing her a salary so that she might learn the system in the Chicago Filinc Association. We then .employed a field worker in the Association to come" to Lincoln She was, of course, an expert filer and helped to set up our system. It took the Chicago Filing Association field worker about two months to set up the system. It does not cost any more to file letters correctly than it docs to file them incorrectly. In fact, it has constituted a real saving for the taxpayers. The filing clerk will tell you about this system in her own words. The importance of a Central Filing system has certainly proved its oT^ 1" U UA I °rC SyStCm was "ntralized each sten - w!nS ft uTJ*"?"} did her own fi'ins- Then &gt; when any°ne wanted a letter, he had to find out to what department it was written - then ask the stenographer of that department for it.

These are filed by name of town, such as Humbolt—Bratton Union Cons. The label for this type of folder is blue. Every blue folder, then, belongs to the Secondary Edu - cation 1 )epartment. We have individual folders, by county, for the approved non-accred - ited schools in Nebraska. There is a general folder and as many folders ns there are schools in that county. We use salmon colored labels for these folders. These folders comprise the Rural Education Department. We have an individual folder for every county, in which are filed letters from county superintendents and all letters pertaining to school law. These labels are white. This is our Legal and Research Depart - ment. We have another individual for certification questions, another folder called "grade sheets," and still another for "registrations-" Be - fore a normal training student can get a certificate to teach, he has to take seventeen examinations in certain subjects. His grades are record - ed in the folder called "grade sheets" and his registration number is recorded in the folder called "registrations." These three folders com - prise the Certification Department and buff labels arc applied. There are, of course, other individual folders for any person or firm with whom we have quite a bit of correspondence. Then, we have a miscellaneous folder. In it we place in the front, letters of a general nature, and in the back, applications for every cer - tificate issued in Nebraska. The letters are all letter size and the appli - cations legalsize, and colored blue, pink, tan, etc., according to type of certificate issued. So you can readily see we do not get these certifi - cates mixed. That is our alphabetical file. We also have a file called our "subject file." In it we place mimeo - graphed letters and papers we want to keep for an indefinite period. This file is not transferred every year as is the alphabetic file. As we get bulletins of every kind and description from every state in the Union, we last year had a cabinet built for a bulletin file. We ordered bulletin boxes and put them on shelves in the cabinet. We have two more files—our card files. We keep a card for every normal training student in Nebraska who takes the state examina - tions for a third grade elementary certificate. These are filed by county and then by name. After the student gets his certificate, the card is filed by name only. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT We have a double check en the applications for certificates. We make a card for every person getting a certificate. This card is filed in another card file, alphabetically by name. Then when we want to know what year to look for the application of John Jones we look for the card and see just what year the certificate was issued. We keep three years correspondence in the Filing Room. Previous years are kept upstairs in a transfer room called "the attic." There are records up there as far back as 1871. This office has to keep nearly everything, because a teacher may come in—one who taught perhaps back in 1910 or previous, and we have to find her credits or application.

The year 1935-36 we separated them and did the same -with filing. ♦♦Secondary Education Dep't. had an increase of 6,477 filing this year over last year, 1934-1935. The Grand total filing for this year was about 3,000 less than last year, but more than the years 1932-33 and 1933-34. Trends in Grade and High School Enrollments The following tables show the enrollments in the Nebraska schools in the various grades for each year of die last decade. Some of the more im - portant facts shown in these figures and which we feel are worthy of the at - tention of all concerned are given herewith. 1. The total enrollment in the First Grade in 1926 was 40,577. The enrollment in 1936 is 28,874, a decrease of 11,703. In one decade die birth rate in Nebraska has evidently fallen off approximately 28 percent. It ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p049">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION pears that we have passed our peak in grade enrollment. We may expect a further decrease in enrollment in the elementary grades in our schools during die next decade unless die state should experience an influx of population from the other states. 2. In 1926 die per cent of boys and girls in die First Grade were re - spectively 52.1% and 47.9% and in the twelfth grade 42.1% and 57-9%. In 1936 the per cent of boys and girls in the First Grade were respectively 52.3% and 47.7% which is approximately die same ratio as in 1926. but in die Twelfth Grade the per cent of boys is 47.3% and of girls is 52.7%. Evidently our schools are able to hold die boys better than did those of a decade ago. 3. Anodier evidence of die holding power of our schools or die in - creased interest in education among die people of our state is die following. The total enrollment in 1926 in the First and Twelfth Grades respectively were 40,577 and 12,596. In 1936 these figures were 28,874 and 16,642. Whereas in die First Grade the enrollment decreased 28% in die ten-year period, it increased 32% in the Twelfth Grade. Comparing die enrollments in die First and Twelfdi Grades for diese two years we find diat in 1926 die enrollment of die First Grade was over diree times as large as diat of die Twelfth Grade and in 1936 less than twice as large. 4. In the four-year period 1932 to 1935 inclusive a total of 53,281 pupils graduated from die Eighth Grade in the rural schools of Nebraska. In the school year of 1935-36 there were enrolled in the high schools in Nebraska a total of 24,129 non-resident students. This represents less than 50% of those who were entitled to free high school privileges. We may expect a greater percentage of these Eighth Grade graduates to enter our high schools in the future and for this reason our high school enrollment will increase during the next decade, while during die same period our grade enrollment will be decreasing.

These sections, commonly known as die Mallery Act, provide for a state subsidy of #100 toward equipment and £150 additional annually to schools which provide a two-room school building, #150 and #200 respectively to schools which provide a three-room school building, and #250 and #300 respectively to schools providing a four - room school building.

The first year in which it has been possible to make a distribution of funds to Mallery Act Schools since 1923 was in 1933 when 3.5% of the amount to which they were eligible was available. In 1934 due to the lowered demand for aid to weak districts this apportionment was increasedd to 60.5.^ of the funds to which the Mallery Act schools were entitled. During the past biennium the following amounts have been available for distribution to the Mallery Act schools, 1934 —#10,781.00 and 1935 —#17,198.88. These amounts represent 62.5 % and 69.4 % respectively of die amounts to which the schools qualifying under the Mallery Act were entitled for each of these two years. Distribution was made of these funds to the following schools and in die amounts given under dates of April 5, 1935 and April 6, 1936. The same recommendations which were made to the state legislature in the Thirty-Second Biennial Report under date of January, 1935, regarding die appropriations for the Mallery Act are respectfully submitted to the legislators of the First Unicameral Legislature. These are as follows: "This department feels that normally #100,000 will be used biennially for state aid to weak rural districts and between #50,000 and #70,000 biennially for rural consolidated and rural high schools qualifying under the Mallery Act." The state, we feel, has a moral obligation eidier to appropriate money for the Mallery Act schools or to repeal the law. </seg>

Safeguarding State School Fund Case No. 29854: "It appears to us by analogy that the moneys from the state licenses which are now being granted by the state liquor control commission do not belong to any particular school district within which the business of any particular licensee is carried on, but such moneys are for the use of all the school districts within the jurisdiction of the body granting the licenses, and as such body is a state commission, it is proper to follow the law as established by the legis - lature and pay such moneys to the state treasurer, to be accounted for under the state school fund. "Where two sections of the same statute, passed at the same time, are inconsistent with and repugnant to each other, such a construction must be given as will harmonize apparently conflicting provisions. "Statutes are to be construed in the light of a clearly apparent legislative policy. "Such an interpretation should not be given a statute as would render superfluous, redundant, and meaningless entire sections thereof. "If the language of a statute is ambiguous, the court will consider its purpose as a whole, and seek to carry out, and not defeat, such purpose." Early in 1936 the State Attorney General held that the State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction should distribute liquor license fees assessed by the State under House Roll 128 to the respective counties in which they accrued. The State Superintendent maintained that these moneys were for the use of all school districts and that under the provisions of Section 79-2001 and 79-2002 he could not legally distribute them as the Attorney General directed. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION In Case No. 29854, School District of Omaha v. Gass, filed June 19, 1936, the Supreme Court held: * "That the method of distribution of these funds which has been followed in the past is proper and lawful and it has been a legal distribution of these funds under the law ***** The action of die state officers in handling the state license moneys is confirmed and approved." This is die third time that the position of the State Superintendent relative to the distribution of these license moneys has been sustained by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has clearly indicated its position in die matter, and any effort to divert diese funds from the schools merely results in cosdy litigation. ■ • ■ ■ BONDED INDEBTEDNESS Statement No. 9 shows the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the various subdivisions arranged by counties and amounts to $79,349,064.94 on June 30, 1936. The bonds outstanding on June 30, 1934, totaled $93,095,800.00, reflecting a decrease of indebtedness of $13,746,736.00. The above figures do not include $6,860,000.00 of the Omaha Metropolitan Utilities revenue bonds, for the reason that there is a sinking fund of $4,084,131.79 in the treasury of the district with which to pay these bonds as they become due. The subdivisions are to be congratulated on the very fine showing they have made in. the past two years in reducing the bonded indebted - ness of the various municipal and rural divisions of the state. How - ever, there is a tendency on the part of the subdivisions to ignore both the spirit and letter of the law in reference to making levies for the payment of bonds when they are due. The law requires that the levy be made to pay the interest and also the principal when the bonds are matured. Oftentimes this is not done, and if the levy is made it is in many cases diverted to other uses. This of course necessitates the refunding of many issues. Some issues of bonds have been re - funded so many times that before the bonds are finally paid, the original issue has cost the district in interest alone the amount of the principal, not including the additional expense incident to the refund - ing issues that follow. It is my opinion that the law should be so strengthened as to en - force a sufficient levy to be made to pay bonds at maturity and that it be a criminal offense to divert the money collected for any other purpose. This would insure all bonds being paid at maturity, and the taxpayer would be relieved in his district of the extra burden placed on him because of the seeming disregard of statutes by those who represent him in official positions.—State Auditor's Report, 1934-1936. </seg>

L. McBrien in his life which came to a close, March 25, 1935. The whole State of Nebraska mourns the loss of one of its greatest men. Mr. McBrien was born in Newton County, Kansas on March 19, 1867 and at die time of his death was sixty-eight years of age. He received his early education in die public schools in Missouri and later attended Campbell Normal University at Holton, Kansas; Peru State Teachers College, and the University of Nebraska. He received die Bachelor of Education degree from die Peru State Teachers College in 1904 and his Master of Arts degree from die University of Nebraska in 1908. At die time of his death he had practically completed die work for his Ph. D. de - gree. His educational career was a long and varied one and began in Johnson County, Nebraska in 1890, when he was elected to die office of county super - intendent. In 1893 he was chosen dean of Orleans College, Orleans, Ne - braska and held this position until 1897 when he was elected superintendent of city schools of Geneva, Nebraska. In 1901 he was appointed deputy state superintendent of public instruction, serving under State Superintendent, W. K. Fowler, for two terms, and in 1905 was elected to die office of state superintendent of public instruction which office he held until 1909. From 1909 to 1911, he was director of extension at the University of Nebraska. In 1913, he was appointed to a position in die United States Bureau of Education in the Department of Interior, which position he held until 1921. From 1921 to 1924 Mr. McBrien served as head of the Department of Rural Education and Director of Rural Drama in the Indiana State Teachers College of Terre Haute, Indiana. He was elected professor of rural educa - tion in the Central State Teachers College in Edmond, Oklahoma, in 1924, and he remained here until 1933 at which time he was appointed director of character education for die Nebraska State Department of Public Instruc - tion by State Superintendent Charles W. Taylor, which position he con - tinued to hold until die time of his death. Mr. McBrien brought to his work an enthusiasm and intensity of purpose of unusual degree. He was an inspiration to those with whom he worked nnd combined with his rare ability of organization and foresight that of achieving results. He was a dreamer of dreams and he lived to see those dreams come true. Mr. McBrien was instrumental in the passage of more constructive school legislation than any other one person in Nebraska. Some of the more important of these laws were the junior normal school law; die law which provided for die organization of county high schools; die first successful free high school tuition law; and the normal training law which stands on the statute books today widi practically no change from the original draft. We honor and respect the memory of this man who worked unceasingly for the welfare of the boys and girls of our Commonwealth. </seg>

After serving as superintendent of schools in St. Paul, Minden, and Kearney, he became the first president of Kearney State Teachers College in 1905 and served for nine years. During this period he had the privilege of seeing the school achieve a remarkable development not only in the growth of student enrollment and the physical plant but also in the professional standards and the prestige of the school. In 1915 he was elected state superintendent of public instruction and served until 1917 when he was called to the State of Maine to die position of state superintendent of schools which position he held until 1929.

            <seg id="p065">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Samuel Avory The death of Dr. Samuel Avery on January 25th, 1936, removed the most conspicuous figure connected with the development of the University of Nebraska in its middle and later period. His connection covered 40 years with a brief interval while he was in the University of Idaho. From 1908 to 1927 he was in command of university policies as chan - cellor. This was the period of its greatset growth. New colleges were set up in 1909 and later, giving more definite objectives to the courses of instruc - tion with a larger conception of the opportunities which a modern university should offer as its service to the state. In all these movements Dr. Avery was aggressive in laying sound foundations for new movements and sympa - thetic with the idea that a state university supported by public taxation should serve all classes of people. When Dr. Avery became chancellor in 1908 the wave of expansion in student numbers was just beginning. His work for the expansion of the old city campus and of building a new university plant, not yet completed,-may be looked upon as his greatest work. From a campus of four city blocks in 1908 to a present campus of 57 acres, represents years of long and patient planning, struggles with legislatures, adjustments of internal competition, and the final transformation to a new university with enlarged faculties and a dis - tinctly higher educational standard. In evaluating the qualities which made for his success as administrator might be mentioned his sound scholarship and his thoroughly analytical mind. He was schooled in the liberal arts, but his later interest was more in the scientific field. His love of chemistry continued through his many years as nn administrator. His reputation as a teacher was well known. Some of the foremost teachers of chemistry today were among his former students. His personal habits were simple. No formality was necessary for an interview. Throughout all the building program he opposed any extensive ornamentation. Simple, harmonious design with interiors adapted to their special use has given us a harmonious university plant at a very minimum of cost. This modernized plant, though still unfinished, together with the col - leges set up to offer more vocational opportunities, may be looked upon as his contribution to the University. As a friend he was cordial, unaffected, sympathetic. His greatest in - terest was in seeing the University grow and increase its services to the state. He had a host of friends who valued him for some personal service he had rendered them when they were in need. </seg>

            <seg id="p067">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION George Ellsworth Martin In the death of George Ellsworth Martin, Nebraska has lost one of its best known and most progressive educators. His period of life and service in the schools of our state covers a time of great advancement in the history of education and no small part of the progress made was due to his work and effort. He was perhaps best known for his work at the Kearney State Teachers College, to which institution he came in 1915 and of which he was president for the past seventeen years. President Martin was born March 19, 1872 at Falls City, Nebraksa. He was the son of Reverend and Mrs. Elza Martin. He received his. early train - ing in the public schools of that place and later attended the Peru Normal School from which institution he was graduated in 1909. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Nebraska in 1914 and his Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1919. President Martin began his teaching career in 1893 in the rural schools of southeastern Nebraska. He served as principal of the Dawson, Nebraska, schools from 1899 to 1903, at which time he was called to the principalship of the Nebraska City High School. He spent a total of twelve years in Ne - braska City serving as high school principal until 1908 and from 1908 to 1915 as the superintendent of the city schools. He was selected as professor of English at the Kearney State Teachers College in 1915, in which department he taught for two years. In 1917 ha was placed at the head of the teacher training department, which position he held until 1919 when he became president of the institution. This position he held until the time of his death, July 18, 1936. The history of the Kearney State Teachers College under his leadership has been marked by a consistent growth and ever-raising standards. In the seventeen years which he served as president he saw the student enrollment almost treble in size, the faculty increase from a total of thirty-six members to a total of fifty-five and the standards of the faculty raised to tWpoint where each member holds at least a Master's degree. President Martin was a life member of the Nebraska State Teachers Association since 1900, president of the Nebraska Association of Superin - tendents and Principals in 1906, president of the Southeast Nebraska Teachers Association in 1907, a life member of the National Educational Association since 1910, president of the Fourth District of the Nebraska State Teachers Association in 1930-31, and vice-president of the National Educational Association in 1935. In addition to his work as a school administrator, President Martin is perhaps best known for his work as the author of a series of readers which has been used widely in the Nebraska schools. These readers written in conjunction with Mr. George Searson were published in 1910. George Ellsworth Martin needs no eulogy. The qualities of his man - hood and the achievements of his career speak for him. The State of Ne - braska has lost a true friend and education a great leader. </seg>

In June, 1935, at- the conclusion of a quarter of a century of devoted service, school, city, and state honored Dr. Conn as President of Wayne Teachers College. Often characterized as "the builder," he early visioned the possibilities of the Wayne State Teachers College. Through the years he established the training departments and built buildings which are among the finest in the middle west. The present school plant has few equals in the country and stands as a monument to his vision and genius. From a small school with a graduating class of three in 1911, the school realized steady growth to a fully accredited four-year teachers college, granting more than two hundred teachers certificates annually. Dr. Conn received his early training at National Normal University in Lebanon, Indiana, and his special training at the University of Chicago. In 1922, Nebraska Wesleyan University at Lincoln conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws. He began his teaching career at the age of nine - teen, serving as principal and superintendent of schools in Indiana and Illinois until 1895, when he came to Wayne, Nebraska, to be superintendent of city schools. He was chosen head of the mathematics department at the college in Fremont, Nebraska, in 1905, and in 1907 he was called to Columbus to head the city schools. When the state took over the private Normal School in Wayne, in 1910, he became the first president of the Wayne State Normal School. Dr. Conn's highest hopes were realized when he retired in September, 1935, as President Emeritus. His career is closely linked widi the develop - ment of public education in Nebraska. His work is etched deeply in the character of all with whom he came in contact. Many pay tribute to the nobility of his life and influence. </seg>

            <seg id="p078">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The University of Nebraska sets the standards for the four-year certi - ficates, that is, for those certificates which are based upon graduation from an institution authorized to confer the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science. The Board of Education for State Normal Schools sets the standards for institutional certificates based upon one and two years of college work. In January of 1927, a State Board of Examiners was set up under the provisions of the sections just named. This board consists, at the present time, of the following members: Chairman, Dr. B. E. McProud, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Lincoln, Nebraska; Dr. H. F. Martin, President, Midland College, Fremont, Nebraska; and Dr. A. A. Reed, Director of Extension and University Examiner, the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. W. A. Rosene, Director of Certification of the State Department of Public Instruction is ex-officio Secretary of the board. This board visits the various colleges of the state in order to determine whether or not they may be approved for the issuance of teachers' certificates. During the past biennium th; State Board of Examiners has visited and inspected every institution of higher learning which issues teachers' certificates at least twice. Board members serve without pay and receive only their necessary traveling expenses. The State Dpartment of Public Instruction wishes to take this opportunity to express to the members of the Board of Examiners its very great appreciation for the splendid service which they have rendered to the colleges of the state. CONFERENCE OF NEBRASKA CERTIFICATING AGENCIES Cornhuiker Hotel, March 26, 1936 | On March 4, State Superintendent, Charles W. Taylor, sent the following letter to all Nebraska state, municipal, denominational, and junior colleges interested in the issuance of certificates, calling a meeting on March 26: "We are hereby calling a conference of the certificating agencies in the state of Nebraska to meet at the Hotel Cornhusker on Thursday, March 26. This meeting just precedes the Superintendents and Principals Association Convention, which perhaps several of you will also attend. The conference will begin at 9 o'clock, Thursday morning. "The purposes of this conference are as follows: First, that some agreement may be made regarding the title, the requirements for, and certificates to. be issued by the various certificating agencies in the state.

M., a group of about 35, incl-ding college presidents, deans, and directors of teacher training, was called to order by State Superintendent Taylor whose opening remarks were in part as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT "As a basis for the present discussion of certification, we turn back 55 years. In 1881 Peru Normal College was by law given die right to grant teachers' certificates. This was a first grade state certificate—the highest provided by law in the state, based on two years of college work. That has been the continued policy from that day to die present time on die part of die state normal schools. "Sixteen years later, in 1897, die University of Nebraska by law was authorized to grant die university teachers certificate, and at die same time other rules and regulations were set up by which the private and denominational colleges could properly enter into the granting of certificates. The university certficate could not be any - diing more dian a first grade state certificate although it was based on four years of work. "There are certain elements in which die private and denomina - tional colleges are bound by die normal schools for die two-year certificate on die one hand, and on die other, by die university for certificates based upon four or more years of college work. "In 1925 State Superintendent Matzen was instrumental in secur - ing die passage of a law which co-ordinated die teachers' certification from die third grade classification up to die Nebraska permanent special high school certificate. This was a distinct forward step, but should have been more closely integrated widi die issuance of certificates by diese odier agencies. "Nobody is to blame or to be criticized for diese, but it is easy to see why we have so many overlapping certificating procedures and a multiplicity of certificating agencies. There are about thirty-one certificates issued in Nebraska at die present time. In addition to diese die vocational education department issues certain odier cer - tificates. There is no centralization of audiority in any one place." Mr. W. A. Rosene, Director of Certification in die State Superin - tendent's office, outlined briefly some of die problems diat have come to die attention of die department within die last few months. "(1) We feel diat diere is a definite need for a central record - ing agency at which place a complete record of all certificates issued in die state shall be kept. There is no such central recording agency at die present time. "(2) There is a need for simple and uniform tides for Nebraska certificates. There is confusion caused by die fact diat so many cer - tificates bear similar tides and yet represent different amounts of college preparation and different kinds of preparation. There is a need, as we see it, for a reduction in die number of kinds of cer - tificates issued as well as in a uniform tide for certificates which </seg>
            <seg id="p081">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION represent the same amount of preparation and the same kind of preparation. "(3) We feel that there is a need of uniformity in the termin - ology of various courses offered in education by the various schools. We would suggest that courses in education be classed under the four following main headings: (a) history, philosophy, and principles of education, (b) educational psychology, (c) methods of teaching, (d) school administration. "(4) We feel that a certain amount of practice teaching could well be made one of die specific requirements for die issuance of a Nebraska teaching certificate. All of our neighboring states definitely require a certain amount of practice teaching for a teacher's certificate." President W. R. Pate, Peru State Teachers College, discussed briefly problems as viewed from die standpoint of the teachers colleges. He stressed die need for uniformity in terminology of courses; also die need for adapting the requirements in professional courses to diose of odier states. Dean B. E. McProud, Nebraska Wesleyan University, gave a short discussion of certification problems as encountered by the denominational colleges of die state. He stated diat in die maze of certification diey emphasize only two certificates—the two-year and the four-year certificate. He said diat he was most heartily in favor of simplifying die types of certificates, and die ways and means of granting them. He also stressed die importance of uniformity in terminology of courses. Professor A. A. Reed, University of Nebraska, presented a ten-point plan for die consideration of die group. Dean F. E. Henzlik, Teachers College, who with Professor Reed repre - sented die University of Nebraska, suggested diat die State Department of Public Instruction be made die administrative agency for issuing all teachers' certificates now issued by higher institutions of learning, upon recommenda - tions of die faculties of state institutions or upon die recommendation of faculties of other institutions diat are recognized upon die basis of state institutions, as now provided by law. He suggested diat provisions should be made for die certification of all officials exercising a supervisory function over elementary or secondary schools or of school systems, based upon proper academic and professional preparation and upon a reasonable amount of experience. Dr. C. A. Fulmer, Director of Vocational Education, made die sugges - tion diat all teachers' certificates be issued by die State Department of Public Instruction, but that each college or university issue diplomas to those who have met die requirements for teachers' certificates, which diploma would indicate die field in which die teacher had made preparation and was qualified as a teacher. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF STATE SUPERL JTENDENT The entire group entered into informal disit:ssion of the whole problem of certification. It was suggested that a committee be appointed by the chairman to work on the points presented by Professor Reed, said committee to consist of one representative from each type of school, that is, University, normal schools, and denominational colleges. The State Superintendent stated that he thought this would not be a large enough group and suggested that each school represented at the meeting select its own representative. This was agreed to by the assembly and the following persons were selected to serve on the committee to meet at 1 P. M. and to report back to the general assembly at 2 P. M. The meeting was adjourned at 12 o'clock. Professor A. A. Reed, Chairman University of Nebraska - _. F. E. Henzlik Chadron Normal Robert I, Elliott Kearney Normal Hans C. Olsen Peru Normal .._._W. R.

We recommend that all certificates shall be issued by the State Super - intendent of Public Instruction upon recommendaticn of the Board of Education of State Normal Schools or the Board of Regents of the University; that schools other than those under the jurisdiction of these boards have their certificates issued likewise; and that a committee some - what as now organized, shall determine whether these other institutions are meeting the requirements as prescribed by these boards. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 2. We recommend that no certificate shall be granted on less than one year above a four-year high school course, after September 1, 1940. 3. We recommend that junior high school certificates for grades seven to nine shall require sixty college hours. 4. We recommend that high school certificates shall require one hun - dred twenty college hours. 5. We recommend diat supervisory certificates for the elementary schools, having six or more teachers, shall require one hundred twenty college hours and two years of experience. 6. We recommend that the supervisory officer in any system of ten or more teachers shall have thirty college hours above die baccalaureate degree and two years of experience. 7. We recommend that one semester (the equivalent of three semester hours) of cadedng, or teaching in a practice school or in other approved school under supervision, be required for all new certificates. 8. We recommend that students shall not be admitted to the profes - sional courses in normal training high schools or to the professional courses for elementary teachers in colleges until they pass the battery of tests in the tool subjects. 9. We recommend that an increased appropriation be made available to the State Department of Public Instruction for strengthening its supervisory program. j The committee report of recommendations was unanimously adopted by the assembly. Reciprocity It was suggested that the State Superintendent work out a reciprocity arrangement with other states, and report back to the group at a later meeting. Nebraska College Council of Education It was moved, seconded, and unanimously carried that this group to - gether with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction constitute the Nebraska Council of Education on which council will be represented the collegiate institutions of the state, and that the State Superintendent of Public Instruction be ex-officio chairman. i ■ ■ Adjournment At 2:30 'P.

The rural school problems, objectives, and achievements in Nebraska are of vital interest not only to the rural sections of our state but to all of Nebraska. The importance of the rural schools of Nebraska may well be appreciated when the number of rural school pupils is considered. In 1934 - 35 there were 90,103 pupils enrolled in 6,133 elementary rural schools in Nebraska. "The little one room rural school, though lacking in glamour and show, is still the backbone of the school system in an agricultural state such as ours." Decided progress has been made through the carrying on of an ambitious program in the rural schools. The success of each individual child has been our goal for it is our belief that education is doing its best only when it helps every boy and girl to succeed. The State Department of Public In - struction, county superintendents, teachers, school officers, and patrons have made an earnest, cooperative effort to provide improved educational ad - vantages for the boys and girls in the rural districts. The work of the Division of Rural Education is to give particular help to county superintendents, school officers, teachers, and patrons in formulat - ing and developing county-wide and local progressive school programs that will result in the improvement of rural schools. Intensive effort is directed toward the realization of certain goals, namely, more efficient teaching, im - provement of supervision of instruction, standard and superior rural schools, improved equipment, enriched libraries, and greater cooperation of home and school. As in other states, the work of the Director of Rural Education in Ne - braska is concerned with promoting the state program of rural education, supervision of instruction, and research. Professional leadership gives en- </seg>
            <seg id="p123">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION couragement to initiative and creative ability. It stimulates professional growth and gives helpful suggestions, new ideas, inspiration, and higher professional ideals to the teachers. As a part of the field work, the Director of Rural Education has ad - dressed county teachers' institutes, group teachers' meetings, district teachers' associations, school officers' meetings, eighth grade promotion exercises, local, district, and state Parent-Teacher Association meetings, standardization and superior school meetings, schoolhouse dedications, normal training dubs, radio audiences, church, club, and other community meetings. Teachers have been visited in the classrooms and individual conferences have been held with parents, school officials, and teachers. The office work of this division has included the revision of the Course of Study for Elementary Schools in Nebraska, preparation of the rural teachers' manual of two hundred pages, "Rural Education Moving Forward," the preparation of the County Superintendents' Supervisory Bulletins, rural and elementary school correspondence, issuance of certificates of member - ship in the state rural school chorus, preparation of questions for the eighth grade examinations, and answering inquiries as to source material for ad - dresses nnd discussions. Many circulars and professional helps were pre - pared by this division for the use of county superintendents and teachers in order to improve instruction in the schools. During the biennium 108 mimeo - graphed bulletins, consisting of 171 pages, were sent to each county superin - tendent. Many of these bulletins were duplicated for all teachers by this office or by the county superintendent's office. The work of this particular division cannot be measured merely in terms of statistical data. It is our desire to realize with the cooperation of the home, the school, and the church the richest dividends for the Nebraska boys nnd girls, namely, the achievement of permanent interests in inspirational and recreational reading, the development of good habits of study, the ap - preciation of good music, and the acquisition of qualities of good citizenship. Shall we not guarantee to every child the opportunity to grow and develop so that he may be able to fill his place as a useful citizen of our great state? IMPROVING INSTRUCTION Intelligent guidance, a helping hand, willingness to assist where needed, the pointing out of a better teaching procedure, and needed encouragement ofttimes change failure into success for the teacher and bring to the boys and girls a year of happy achievement and progress that contributes greatly to their growth and development. A state public school system needs ade - quate supervision of the rural elementary schools in order that these schools may be administered economically and efficiently just as a state highway sys - tem needs ample supervision and direction in economical road construction and maintenance. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The promotion of efficiency and professional growth of our teachers may be realized and is being realized by classroom visitation, commendation, con - structive individual criticism, classroom demonstrations, tests and measure - ments, standards of achievement, individual instruction, contests and ex - hibits, teachers' meetings and institutes, school demonstration days and patrons' days, the issuance of circulars and bulletins, and emphasis on teach - ing units, projects, and activities. THE 1936 NEBRASKA COURSE OF STUDY FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN NEBRASKA Under the provisions of Chapter 79-901 and 79-1502, Compiled Stat - utes of Nebraska, the State Superintendent is charged with the responsi - bility of prescribing and laying out a feasible Course of Study for the Public Elementary Schools. The last Course was published in 1929. About two years ago, it became apparent that it would be necessary to reprint the old Course or publish a new one. With conditions changing so rapidly, Courses of Study must of necessity change, thus the decision to publish the new Course. The new Course of almost six hundred pages is costing no more than the old Course. A new feature which will be greatly appreciated by teachers and school executives is uniformity of paging. To the Director of Rural Education was given the responsibility for evolving and setting up this Course of Study. Based on Child Development The new 1936 Course of Study for Elementary Schools, which has been welcomed in the state as "A New Bill of Rights" for the school child, is based on a program of child development and aims to aid in realiz - ing for every child in Nebraska certain opportunities for development "that will help him to take his place as a citizen' of our great republic." It ex - alts the needs of the child above the curriculum and undertakes to embrace a philosophy of education whereby the everyday activities of the life of the child, the home, the community, and the state are definitely linked up with the school. It does not eliminate die virtues of the 1929 Course. A Nebraska Course The new Course speaks eloquently of the educational work that the schools are actually doing in Nebraska. It represents the work of members of die teaching profession who are carrying very heavy schedules and who have found it necessary to forego needed hours of recreation in order to submit certain assignments on time. Recognition is due the Nebraska edu - cators who were so willing to contribute to the Course. The work on the Course of Study has been donated free of charge to the people of the State of Nebraska. Efficiency in Teaching The new Course of Study includes 587 pages and represents the latest in the field of education. It will give to die teacher adequate help so that </seg>
            <seg id="p125">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION she may teach efficiently and bring about effective learning and critical think - ing on the part of the pupils. It is hoped that the parents and taxpayers may become familiar with the contents of this Course of Study and the state educational program. Comments from the Press on the 1936 Course of Study The School Executive, October, 1936: Humanizing the Course of Study "The 1936 State Course of Study for Elementary Schools in Nebraska is an outstanding example of what can be done to put human interest and life into what oftentimes is a more or less dull outline of required subjects. According to Miss Chloe C. Baldridge. State Director of Rural Education, who is responsible for assembling and preparing much of the material for this fine Course, all the material has actually been tested in the schools. It represents the work of members of the teaching profession throughout the state who willingly contributed to this work. Throughout the book, acknowl - edgments are made for these contributions. "While lack of funds prevented the engagement of outside curriculum experts to survey the schools and to assist in the preparation of this Course, it is felt that the 'wealth of scholastic training, the fine experience, and outstanding records of service' which have gone into the making of a coop - erative Course, make it a real source of inspiration and guidance. "It is a truly modern Course of Study. While all the virtues of the old Course—all those things which have been tried and found true —have been retained, many new things have been added, and the Course has been greatly enriched and brought up-to-date. Outstanding Features "The Course bears out the philosophy of an education based on the needs of each individual child. The slow learner, the average, and the ex - ceptional pupil have all been taken into consideration. This helpful guide is flexible enough so that the teacher may easily adapt the various assignments to her particular needs. "Inasmuch as this Course is based upon the theory that every child must succeed, special attention has been given to 'developing the whole child' ,-ind much emphasis is placed upon 'habit forming and the acquiring of de - sirable attitudes.' There is a complete break from the old method of mere memorization of factual data, and a definite recognition of the fact 'thar one of the major problems in the school work is to teach children how to think rather than what to think.' "In the preparation of this Course, the following was adopted as an accepted aim in education: 'To teach pupils to do better the desirable things they are likely to do anyhow' and 'to direct them into those higher activities </seg>
            <seg id="p126">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT of adult life which are essential in the preservation and progress of the social order.' Other important objectives of education have also been recognized. Special attention throughout all die assignments has been given to character development, social-mindedness, health, discovery, and development of de - sirable individual aptitudes, wise use of leisure time, cultivation of the habits of critical thinking, and mastery of the tools of learning. "The Course has been organized according to units of work. At the beginning of each section, the general and specific aims for that particular subject are given. If these aims, which have been carefully worked out for every subject, can actually be accomplished in the classroom, then every child who comes under the influence of this Course may be assured of a well-rounded education. "One of the most outstanding features of the reading section is die presentation of 'experience stories,' which have actually been prepared by rural school children. Also, definite suggestions are made for the planning and preparation of other 'experience stories.' Directly in line with die pri - mary objective of complete child development, this section aims to carry out die dieme of 'learning by doing.' "In language and grammar, too. the child is directed to speak and to write on subjects of his own interest and liking. "Considerable attention has been devoted to character education and to health education, including a month's study devoted to temperance educa - tion. Much emphasis is placed upon the teaching of safety. Consideration has been given to safety on the street and highway, and in the home and at school; safety at play and on the farm; and to fire prevention. "The assignments for the social studies are directly in line with sug - gestions made in die Fourteenth Yearbook of the Department of Superin - tendence of die N.E.A. The suggested procedure for history for the third and fourdi years, which consists entirely of anticipation and observance of holidays and special days, contains some especially interesting and valuable suggestions. "In music and art, too, pupils are to be allowed much freedom. They are to be given every opportunity and encouragement for creative expression. "Indeed, die new Nebraska State Course of Study is a real contribution to die curriculum field. It represents what can be done with very little actual cash expenditure, when conscientious, hard-working educators put their tal - ents and dieir hearts into a real undertaking." Extracts from The Lincoln Daily Star, September 2, 1936: "Nebraska's rural schools are being treated to a new course of study for the elementary grades—the first revision since 1929—as die result of months of effort on die part of Miss Chloe C. Baldridge, State Director of Rural </seg>
            <seg id="p127">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Education in the office of State Superintendent Charles W. Taylor. Many Nebraska tenchers and educators cooperated in this educational undertaking which was prepared without cost to the taxpayers, contrary to the procedure in many states where such teaching manuals are compiled only after expendi - ture of considerable sums of money. "The new course of study, comprising a book of 587 pages, represents rhe latest findings in the field of education and will be used by the 6,000 Nebraska rural teachers who have 95,000 boys and girls under their wings as well as by teachers in a number of schools in the smaller towns. Consid - erable emphasis is placed upon safety education in the new book and an interesting development in the section devoted to the teaching of reading is the presentation of 'experience stories' written by rural school tots in con - nection with their reading and writing courses. ""In his foreword, State Superintendent Taylor points out that 'it is not the intention to prescribe rigid courses of study to which each school in rho state must conform' but he explains that rather courses are suggested to be helpful as a guide. "Tribute is paid 'Nebraska teachers who in large numbers were so willing to contribute to the course that they even spent money out of their own pocketbooks in many cases to further the work.'" Extracts from The Omaha Bee-News, August 22, 1936: "Special emphasis is placed upon the constitution and safety education in this new course of study—the first compiled since 1929. Many Nebraska teachers and educators joined State Superintendent Charles W. Taylor and Miss Baldridgc in writing the 587 page tome which contains standardized suggestions on teaching procedure in the country schools where 95,000 Ne - braska boys and girls receive their first eight grades of learning. "While in several states the task of compiling such a course of study involves the expenditure of thousands of dollars, the work on the Nebraska book was donated." Extracts from the Omaha World Herald: "A new 'Bill of Rights' for Nebraska's legion of rural school children who begin their annual march to classrooms next Monday was discussed Friday by Douglas County's 159 teachers at their annual fall institute in the courthouse with County Superintendent H. M. Eaton. The meeting con* tinues today. Similar institutes are being held for the other 6,000 rural teachers of the state. "The 'Bill of Rights' is the course of study prescribed for county schools by State Superintendent Charles W. Taylor and revised for the first time since 1929 by the State Director of Rural Education, Miss Chloe C. Baldridge. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT "It exalts the needs of the child above the curriculum. The right of the child to know the truth about history and civics is stressed. Music and art, often attacked in economy drives as 'frills,' have an important place in the 587 page volume. "Old-fashioned 'drill work' is not ruled out and County Superintendent Eaton points out the course, which he calls a 'real find' and a 'genuine ad - vance,' has enough flexibility to fit almost any local need." Extracts from the Omaha World Herald, September 6, 1936: "The new course of study for the county schools of Nebraska, ar - ranged and prepared by Miss Chloe C. Baldridge, State Director of Rural Education, is a new 'Bill of Rights' for children. "This course of study is written almost entirely from the point of view of die child. His health, happiness and his well-rounded development receive first consideration. .. . "The child is assured that he is more important than the curriculum. 'We want socialized human beings and not mere adding machines and phono - graph records,' states the course of study, and further, 'The emphasis for centuries has been on curriculum, method and on teaching .... the spotlight of science today reveals the learner as the important factor.' . . . "So, for the boys and girls of the Nebraska county schools, the bill of rights is a fairly good guarantee of wholesome instruction and school life; to the teachers it should be a great inspiration, to parents it can be a fine guide for child rearing in the home as well as a measure of his school; to the trustees it should be a guide of what they should expert of. their teachers and should help them judge present day teaching, not by how they were taught years ago, but by what is considered good teaching by the best authorities now. "To the liberal minded this course of study will prove very satisfying, and yet, those who dote on drill and formal work will find ample provision for it on many of the five hundred and eighty-seven pages. A teacher can stress eidier the liberal or the conservative interpretation and satisfy whatever demands any enlightened group of trustees or community might expect of her." Other Typical Comments on the 1936 Course of Study From a County Superintendent: "After using the new Course of Study about three months we are finding it more satisfactory every day. It is definite in instruction and objectives are plainly stated. All our rural teachers arc pleased with it. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "Dean Stockdale of the Chadron Teachers College Training School sums the whole thing up in the following statement: 'It is the best Course of Study for rural schools I have ever seen.' " —Leora A. Rustin, County Superintendent, Dawes County and President of the Nebraska County Super - intendents' Association. • ■"•■• From a University Professor: "I have just found time to go thru your Course of Study for the Ele - mentary Schools of Nebraska and I hasten to tell you diat it is quite the best course in its class I remember to have seen at any time. Accustomed as I am to doing some complex things, I still find myself semi-paralyzed in reviewing the mass of well-ordered material you have gotten together for the use of teachers in the elementary schools of Nebraska. "You are to be especially congratulated on your skill in securing the coop - eration of so many people who supplied material for the book, and on your selecting and organizing it in accessible form. It is my honest conviction that you have set the pattern for all time in Nebraska for a working school - room manual for the elementary-grade teachers of the state."—F. M. Gregg, Department of Psychology, Nebraska Wesleyan University. From State Superintendents: "Some days ago there came to my desk a copy of your recent Course of Study for die Elementary Schools of Nebraska. A careful examination shows that the material has been well selected in the light of modern educa - tion, and well organized for the teachers' use. "It is especially good to know that you propose a closer relationship between the home and the school, because in this way our education has a double value. Even a cursory examination of the pages convinces me that the contents are not for a static world, nor are the areas to be covered mere subject-ma tter-set-out-to-be-learned. "The schools of the State of Nebraska are to be congratulated upon this fine piece of work."—N. D. Showalter, State Superintendent of Wash - ington. "After a rather thorough examination of die Nebraska Course of Study for Elementary Schools by members of our office staff and by myself, I want to compliment you upon having produced a very usable course of study. "We are especially pleased with the very practical alternation program which you have worked out. This well-developed plan of alternation is a model diat affords many helpful suggestions for improvement of our own set-up in Oklahoma....

You de - serve every praise from all Nebraska .... for your fine piece of work and for your courage to stand firmly for an education based on the needs of each individual child. "I hope you will encourage every teacher to see to it that every trustee and every parent has a chance to look through this valuable handbook which, if followed, will make life in the home a much more delightful and fruitful one for the child.... "Any teacher who interprets your 1936 Course of Study in its most liberal form can do wonders for her community and her pupils. In fact, I am certain diat no teacher could really use the new Course of Study with - out developing her own personality considerably. A number of sections are like music, diey are so beautifully expressed and have such a rich, boundless content."—Mrs. Yvonne McCandless, Douglas County. COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS' ANNUAL CONFERENCES The State Department of Public Instruction holds a conference each year widi the county superintendents of the state for the purpose of pre - senting the educational program of the State Superintendent's Office to the county superintendents and assisting them in the organization of the routine work and supervisory and administrative duties of their offices. Following the two-day annual conference, the County Superintendents' Association holds a one-day professional and business meeting. This one-day meeting is conducted by the officers of their Association. At die annual conference, held at Lincoln on January 21, 22, and 23, 1936, discussions were given on the following topics: "The County Super - intendent "and Improvement of Instruction," "Our Service to die Commun - ity through Parent-Teacher Associations and Community Meetings,'' "School Improvement and School Officers' Meetings," "Legal Problems," "The Federal Relief Emergency Program," "Normal Training Problems," "Certification Problems," "Service Available to Rural Communities," "Rural Library Service," "Spiritual Forces in Education," "Knighdiood of Youdi Clubs in Nebraska Schools," "Phases of High School Accreditment and Approval," "Free High School Tuition—Actual Cost or Stated Amounts," and "The Tax Problem." Other inspirational and professional lectures were given. Participation by all county superintendents on committees was one feature of the convention. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The conference to be held December 15, 16, and 17, 1936, will empha - size the themes, "Problems of Education in 1936," "Humanizing the Course of Study," "The Course of Study, a Bill of Rights for the School Child," "Teacher Training," "Secondary Education," "Character Education," and "Training in Service." The reports of the Rural School Achievements as given in Tables One, Two, and Three speak eloquently of the work carried on by the county superintendents. STANDARDS FOR BETTER RURAL SCHOOL TEACHING The most important factor in any school is the teacher. "As the teacher, so is the school." The devotion of the Nebraska teachers to the splendid cause of education should be commended most highly. Even though salaries have been reduced and teaching loads, in many instances, have been made heavier, the teachers have made definite progress. For information in regard to the salaries paid teachers for the biennium, see statistical reports in the back of this volume included under Statistics for the School Year 1934-35, Statistics for the School Year 1935-36, and Summary of Nebraska Public School Statistics. In order to encourage and recognize outstanding teaching in the rural schools, recognition certificates for better rural school teaching were issued by State Superintendent Taylor to 92 teachers this biennium and were based on efficiency in classroom management, classroom procedure,' classroom achievements, realization of the school as a social center, and professional spirit and personal qualities of the teacher. EIGHTH GRADE EXAMINATIONS The completion of the courses of study and passing satisfactorily the final eighth grade examinations under the direction of the county superin - tendent entitle the pupils to the privileges of the free high school law in Ne - braska. "Section 79-901, Nebraska School Laws, Free High School Education, High School Grade Denned, Course of Study, Rules of Admission. Provi - sion is hereby made for four years of free public high school education for all the youth of this state whose parents or guardians live in public school districts which maintain less than a four year high school course of study, on die following conditions, to-wit: "First. For the purposes of this article all grades above die eighth grade in any public school district of this state shall be deemed high school grades. The course of study for the first eight grades in common schools shall be composed of die following subjects: agriculture, bookkeeping, civics, drawing, arithmetic, English composition, geography, grammar, history, men - tal aridimetic, orthography, penmanship, physiology, reading.

Every pupil after taking the course of study may by applying to the county superintendent take examination in these subjects, such examinaton to be held at a time and place designated by the county superintendent and held by him or his assistant, and at no time shall be held by a teacher any of whose pupils are taking the examination. The questions used in such examination shall be furnished by the State Superintendent and be the same in all counties each year. The county superintendent at the close of such examination shall after ascertaining that the name of the pupil is not written on any examination paper, record each set of papers by name and also by number, after which such papers shall be turned over to the examining board who shall consider the papers by number only. Said board shall be appointed by the county superin - tendent and shall consist of at least five competent examiners with qualifica - tions at least equal to those required for a second grade county certificate. Each member of said examining board shall give careful consideration to the grading of each paper, expense of such grading to be paid out of the general fund of the county, and if such pupils shall have passed with an average of seventyfive per cent in the subjects named in this chapter, no subject less than sixty per cent, the county superintendent shall issue a cer - tificate stating the pupil is entitled to free high school tuition, providing the ninth grade is not being taught in the district where pupil's parents or guard - ians reside. The course of study for the high school grades shall be the Nebraska High School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. * * * *" In compliance with the law, the eighth grade examinations have been prepared by the Division of Rural Education and sent out to the county superintendents. Examinations have been conducted by the county superin - tendents on specified dates in January, April, and May. The January exami - nation is given in a few subjects and is designed to enable pupils to do better work. This plan makes it possible for the pupils to devote more time to the remaining major subjects. The purpose of the final eighth grade examinations is to determine the eligibility of pupils to receive free high school tuition from the county for high school instruction in public approved high schools. According to the law, all eighth grade pupils, public, private, parochial, town, city, or rural, regardless of the school they are attending, must pass these examinations in order to be entitled to privileges under the free high school law, namely, free high school tuition. The State Elementary Course of Study is the basis for the preparation of examination questions. A conscientious effort is put forth in order that these examinations may be a fair and a reasonable test of the pupil's ability to satisfactorily do high school work. These examina - tions conform with the standards of attainment for promotion as listed in </seg>
            <seg id="p133">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION the Elementary Course of Study. The examinations also help to diagnose deficiencies in the pupil's work and are helpful to the teachers in determining remedial measures. "BETTER READING" PROGRAM Throughout the state, die slogan has been "Every child a better reader." In addition to developing a love and desire for reading, the state-wide read - ing program has consisted of three phases, viz.: first, the diagnostic or testing phase, according to the chart on pages 42-54, Elementary Course of Study; second, remedial instruction as provided in the Course of Study; and third, the observance of Reading Demonstration Days. Today reading is recog - nized as a tool on which all schoolroom activities depend and is essential for intelligent participation in all activities of modern life. Reading Demonstration Days were conducted last year by 1,220 rural school teachers, as given in Table Number Three. The Reading Demonstra - tion Days have brought about keener interest on die part of die parents, have inspired die children to do better work, and have given die teacher an oppor - tunity to observe die reading in other schools. BETTER EVERYDAY ENGLISH In order to help every child to speak and write correctly, widi clear-cut sentences and no misspelled words, standards of achievement in English have been set forth for each grade. Good English Clubs were sponsored by 1496 rural school teachers last year, as reported in Table Number Three. CITIZENSHIP AND CHARACTER BUILDING As provided in the civics course in our State Elementary Course of Study, boys and girls are being taught to love, respect, and reverence the Constitution of the United States in 5,353 districts according to the reports sent in by teachers as given in Table Number One. The State Department has published and distributed a number of character education bulletins and included a course in character education in the Elementary Course of Study. A report of the character education work is given elsewhere in this biennial report. However, in the presentation .of each subject and in every school activity, character development is die first objective of the teacher. Every effort is being made to develop die right attitude on the part of the pupil toward study and work, the right attitude toward personal and social relations, and the right attitude toward spiritual values and relations. THE RURAL SCHOOL CHORUS We wish to express our sincere appreciation to county superintendents for the splendid results that are being secured in the rural school chorus. </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT This work was conducted by 1,847 teachers during the last school year (Table Number One). During the biennium, 8,983 rural boys and girls received the Nebraska rural school chorus certificate signed by die State Superintendent and were eligible to sing in die rural school chorus at die State Fair. These rural boys and girls had previously sung at the eighth grade promotion exercises and at die county rural school choruses. Fadiers, modiers, and teachers have been delighted to listen to the beautiful tone quality that has been developed in die singing of die boys and girls by this method. A most appreciative and attentive audience greeted the two appearances of the rural school chorus on Tuesday, September 3, 1935, and Tuesday, September 8, 1936. This work is being promoted by our division in order (hat die boys and girls of the rural school may share in the joys of self - expression and appreciation that only good music can bring. Pictures of the rural school chorus are given on pages 133 and 134. EMPHASIS ON GOOD STUDY HABITS Teaching children to study is one of the most important functions of the school. Teachers have been particularly successful in helping the pupils improve their study habits by seeing that the assignments were understood before die classes were dismissed, diereby developing habits of exactness, con - centration, speed, and originality. They have had pupils make out study programs. They showed pupils how to study by learning to summarize each paragraph and then selecting the important points. CONTESTS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF SUBJECT MATTER Other incentives offered for the increasing of interest in rapid calcula - tion and correct spelling were the ciphering contests conducted in 928 schools and the spelling contests participated in by 2,338 schools as indicated in Table Number Two. COUNTY AND STATE EXHIBITS BY COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS Reports received in diis office indicate that counties throughout the state are complying widi Section 79-2120, Nebraska School Laws, which pro - vides tliat diere shall be held, under the supervision and direction of die county superintendent and county board, an exhibit of school work done in each school district of each county during the school year. Four thousand six hundred eighty-two teachers reported to this office that they prepared exhibit work last year' (Table Number Three). The school exhibit at the State Fair, held under die direction of the State Fair Board, is an incentive for die improvement of school work. For several years, the county superintendents have been acquainting the public with the progress of education by means of die school exhibits at the county fairs. </seg>

ENRICHMENT, OF THE RURAL SCHOOL LIBRARY Two thousand nine hundred fifty-five districts purchased library books last "year (Table Number Three). A survey of 28 counties revealed in 1930 that, out of 1,924 schools who reported, 1,363 districts listed the library books in their respective counties. It was found that 490 reports did not list any library books, while reports from 71 districts stated definitely that there were no library books in their respective schools. On the library reports from 1,363 districts, 37^672 books were listed for an enrollment of 25,545 pupils. This means that each pupil in these 1,363 districts averaged 1.47 books. It will be conceded that this is decidedly inadequate. This survey of the rural school library demon - strates the importance of the 1929 library law. This law provides for the enrichment and enlargement of the school library. "Section 79-515. District Board, Shall Provide School District Library, How Financed. The school board or school trustees of every school district within this state shall set aside annually from the general funds collected for die use of the district the sum of five dollars per teacher employed within die school district as shown by die annual report to the county superintendent . . . The amount so set aside shall be known as the district library fund and shall be by the school board or school trustees of such district annually invested in books other than the regular textbooks, which books so provided shall be suitable for the district school library." Three of the state organizations that are cooperating to assist in en - riching die library facilities diis year in the rural schools are the American Association of University Women, die Parent-Teacher Association, and the Nebraska Library Commission. Last year die eleven branches of die American Association of University Women in Nebraska collected and circulated 7,500 books and magazines through the offices of die county superintendents. This year not less dian 18,000 books and magazines have been collected and are being circulated, or are ready to be circulated, in the rural districts. The American Asso - ciation of University Women is to be congratulated on the efforts that it is making to promote die reading of good books and magazines in the rural schools and homes throughout Nebraska. Two thousand nine hundred thirty-two teachers report that pupils are doing home recreational reading (Table Number Three). </seg>
            <seg id="p139">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION HEALTH EDUCATION The course in health education deals with healthful school living, health service, and health instruction. The goal of our health education program is to develop for each child a sound mind in a strong and healthy body. The difference between success and failure is sometimes the difference between a healthy body and an un - healthy body. In order to achieve this ideal, emphasis is placed on personal hygiene and health habits. The course of study in health includes health practices in safety and eleven other units. Attitudes to be developed, under - standings to be attained, essential knowledge to be acquired, and various health activities are included. There is general recognition of the importance of health work in the public schools. Many organizations cooperate with the schools in this important health work. The Nqponal and State Tuberculosis Associations have rendered valuable assistance in making possible through die seal sale the services of a specialist in health education as one of the contributors to die Elementary Course of Study. Visiting school nurses have been made available in some counties. The cooperation of the Parent-Teacher Asso - ciation, the Junior Red Cross, and the 4-H Clubs in health education has been very gratifying. PHYSICAL' EXAMINATIONS Physical examinations are given to all pupils as required by Section 79-2113, Nebraska School Laws. Reports of die physical examinations are sent to the State Board of Public Welfare. SAFETY AND FIRE PREVENTION Safety was taught last year in 5,469 rural schools, as provided for in the course in safety in "Rural Education Moving Forward" (Table Number Two). Fire Prevention has been taught in 5,469 rural schools. In accordance with Section 79-1202, Nebraska School Laws, a Fire Prevention Manual was prepared by die Director of Rural Education and distributed to all teachers in the rural and city schools of Nebraska. Nebraska schools have been recognized by die press and by a Michigan fire prevention publication as leading in the teaching of fire prevention in the nation. SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION Section 79-1409, Nebraska School Laws, provides that instruction shall be given in the public schools with reference to die evil effects of alcoholic drinks and narcotics upon the human system. Courses of Study on "Alcohol and Other Narcotics and their Relation to Health" have been issued by State Superintendent Taylor and have been in the hands of die teachers since 1929. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT hive thousand six hundred fifty-seven rural teachers have reported that they taught the relation of alcohol and other narcotics to health last year, as given in Table Number Two. CONTROL OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES Prevention of disease is another step in our health program. The child, the teacher, the parent, and the community should work together to prevent sickness. "Control of Communicable Diseases" is one of the units worked out in the Elementary Course of Study, page 508. HOT LUNCHES The hot lunch enables the pupils to relish their noonday meals and causes better digestion, better health, and greater power and desire to study. We should like to pay a sincere tribute to the 2,121 rural teachers who are supervising the lunch period, preparing hot lunches during the winter months, or are having the pupils bring food in Mason jars to be warmed by being placed in hot water (Table Number Two). SUPERVISION OF PLAYGROUNDS The daily supervision of the playground is one phase of the health education program. It is a great satisfaction to know that in Nebraska 5^95 rural school teachers supervise their playgrounds (Table Number Two). It is our aim to insure to every child a happy, congenial school association on the school ground that will help him do his very best work in school and will send him home contented and happy . The State Depart - ment has issued a helpful Physical Education Bulletin. This was compiled by Mr. Herbert L. Cushing, former Deputy State Superintendent, and the State Committee on Physical Education. RURAL FIELD DAY Rural Field Day was observed in many counties. One thousand two hundred ninety-four participated in Rural Field Day last year, as reported in Table Number Two. JUNIOR RED CROSS Membership in the Junior Red Cross was reported in 46 counties, with an enrollment of 60,353 pupils. This organization has contributed to personal hygiene and community health. 4-H CLUBS Pupils in 1,200 rural schools participated in 4-H Club work in Ne - braska last year, according to the reports received from county superintend - ents in Table Number One. The 4-H Health Clubs have done splendid work. </seg>

Standardization of rural schools is a voluntary procedure on the part of the school districts themselves. No right of self-control is affected by standardization. Satisfactory physical environment is considered very important to the school life, health, and progress of children and has led to definite standards in buildings, grounds, and working equipment. We are attempt - ing to secure the best one-teacher rural schools possible by establishing definite standards which are conducive to greater care in providing healthful educational advantages for rural children. During the past two years 22 rural schools have been made standard and 3 rural schools have been recognized as superior. This is a splendid record of local and state achievement, particularly in yiew of the financial conditions of the period.

Standardization of rural schools will continue for we find everywhere that local school officials and county superintendents are continuing their efforts to standardize rural schools and to make them more efficient. (See list of standard rural schools on pages 116 to 123, inclusive, of the manual "Rural Education Moving Forward"). Some of the specific benefits of the standardization of rural schools are: 1. It gives the county superintendent, the school officers, and patrons a common interest. It develops school and community pride and cooper - ation. 2. It gives school officers an understanding of school needs for the health and education of the children and guides them in the wise and </seg>
            <seg id="p143">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION economical expenditures of funds. It arouses general interest in school improvement. 3. It secures improvements in buildings and playground. It en - courages better care of the school plant and the cleaning up of the school grounds. 4. It helps the county superintendent to make a close survey of the schools and thus become familiar with conditions. 5. It secures needed teaching equipment. 6. It encourages the employment of better prepared teachers. 7. It encourages the organization of Parent-Teacher Assocations and school and home community organizations. 8. It is an excellent community project for every rural district to score its school in order to determine its efficiency and reveal its needs and achievements. Legislation should be enacted, when expedient, whereby the plans of a new rural schoolhouse may be approved by a school architect, working under the direction of the State Superintendent. This department is not interested in dictating kinds of material, the type of roof, the size of the building, thickness of walls, and similar details that should be left to the decision of the local group, but this department is interested in regard to the school building complying with the requirements of health and sanita - tion and is willing to say that a check should be made relative to new buildings in order that they may meet health requirements. Seventy-three new school houses have been erected during this biennium. In order that progress may continue when a school has reached the full requirements for a standard school, a superior school rating has been established (see pages 86 and 87 of "Rural Education Moving Forward"). MAKING THE SCHOOL SAFE* An accepted right of the childhood of America as listed in the Children's Charter is a school that is safe from hazards, sanitary, properly equipped, lighted, and ventilated. It is well to consider first, certain equip - ment that will make the school safe from all hazards or dangers; second, school equipment for health and sanitation; and, third, equipment for in - structional purposes. Each year, approximately 146 tornadoes sweep across this country, destroying life and property according to United States Weather Bureau statistics. Loss of life due to these storms may largely be prevented if cyclone cellars or storm caves are constructed near schoolhouses and homes. •From address delivered at St. Louis meeting of the N.E.A. Deparl niont of. Superintendence, February 26, 1036, by Director of Rural Education. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT If a cyclone cellar is placed near the schoolhouse, parents are assured that during severe storms their children will be in a place of safety. The ordinary basement may be hazardous on account of falling debris. Cyclone cellars have been constructed in 1.258 rural districts in Ne - braska. Most of these storm caves are in northeast Nebraska. After a recent bitter experience, parents quite generally resolved that in time of peril their children and teachers should be safe. Two teachers, Helen Rooney and Phyllis Stewart, were heroines in the face of that tornado. Helen Rooney succeeded in saving her boys and girls by getting them out of rhe building while she, unmindful of her own safety, lost her life. The storm struck just as she was standing with one hand on the door knob, after helping the last child to escape from the falling building. Phyllis Stewart was warned of the tornado but had no place to go. She gathered her pupils together and attempted to quiet their fears by playing some popular song as they huddled near the piano. Miss Stewart was seriously injured. School fires are too common in every state. While we were writing and proof-reading the material for our Fire Prevention Manual in 1931. there were nine schoolhouse fires in Nebraska. By the time the manual was received from the printer, there were six additional fires, thus making fifteen schoolhouse fires during the time the manual was being prepared. One measure to make our schoolhouses safe from fire hazards is the legal requirement that all doors open outward. Another is in regard to the fuel bin which is occasionally placed near the entrance. If the fuel bin is in the hall, the partition must extend to the ceiling so that, in the event of spontaneous combustion, the burning fuel will be enclosed and the children will have an opportunity to escape through the hall to the outside door. A separate fuel room is recommended. The schoolhouse should have more than one door for an exit. Heavy screens or bars placed over windows should be in a frame that may be easily loosened and removed from the inside. Nailing such obstructions across the window constitutes a fire hazard. A fire extinguisher is important equipment for making a school safe from fire dangers. The Illinois law prohibits the use of wood shingles and pro - vides for fireproof or near fireproof shingles. Our Nebraska law provides that not less than thirty minutes shall be devoted to instruction in fire prevention each month and that one fire drill shall be held each month. Signs of warning to automobile drivers on the highway constitute im - portant safety equipment for the children. Electric light companies should not be permitted to extend their lines for carrying electric current of high voltage on a school ground. A telephone in the school is a great help in time of danger. During blizzards in recent years warnings of oncoming storms have been given over the radio. </seg>

            <seg id="p147">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The unjnckcted stove should not be tolerated in any district. Such a heating unit does not provide for an even heating of the room. Not only must a proper oxygen content be maintained but the humidity of the room must be considered. If possible, the heater should be located in the end of the room and preferably near the entrance. The cold air coming in through an open door will thus be more easily heated. If the heater is at the end opposite the entrance, the cold air will pass over the feet of the children before being heated. The difference between success and failure is sometimes the difference between good health and poor health, between good vision and defective eye - sight, between good hearing and poor hearing. In order that every child may attend a school diat is sanitary, the teacher should be provided with sweeping compound or dampened sawdust for sweeping, or the floor should be varnished and waxed. Facilities should be provided so that good housekeeping will be characteristic of the activities of every classroom teacher. Orderliness and cleanliness are important factors in any good school program. Liquid soap and paper or individual towels are necessary supplies. Shoe scrapers and a door mat will help materially in keeping the building clean. Since the important task of a school is to bring about desirable changes in human beings and to modify human behavior and conduct, then certainly the influences of good housekeeping may be looked upon as being of vital value. Hot lunch equipment is a part of our equipment for health. Two thousand one hundred eighteen rural teachers in Nebraska served hot lunches in their schoolrooms last year. The serving of hot lunches has been a means of bringing about better health and a greater power and desire to study and of inspiring students to share in work and responsibility. Students have been taught table manners and courtesy, proper methods of setting the table, and taking care of dishes and other hot lunch equipment. We should like to pay a sincere tribute to the rural teacher who is providing for hot lunches. Play also contributes to health and brings about maximum efficiency at a minimum cost. It is a positive aid in decreasing the number and character of disciplinary problems. Every rural school should be supplied with at least four types of playground equipment. For playgrounds and recreation, a com - mittee of our county superintendents listed bean bags, teeter totter, baseball equipment, basketball, ropes and rings, giant stride, slide, indoor ball equip ment, baseball diamond, indoor diamond, building blocks, table croquet, toys, and games. I Many do not realize the importance of good drinking water and a sani - tary method of supplying it. In order to safeguard the health of pupils and teachers, the school must be supplied with plenty of pure, clean water. There should be a good well on the school grounds for supplying pure water, and a bubbling drinking fountain. </seg>
            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT EQUIPMENT FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES* For every child a school that is well equipped for instructional purposes! Oiood equipment is a prime requisite in the schoolroom. Any good workman on the farm or elsewhere will insist upon using only the best of tools. A teacher should be privileged to have and to use good equipment and up-to-date textbooks in the classroom. Her responsibility in this regard is two-fold: hrst, to make the best use of the equipment that she has and, second, to plan tor and secure new equipment. In discussing equipment for instruction, we should like to include sup - plies. The small," non-permanent materials that are readily consumed and must be replaced are ordinarily considered to be supplies rather than equip - ment. Equipment constitutes the larger and more permanent items used in furnishing the school plant and maintaining it. The school should have good, modern textbooks, good reference books, dictionaries, library books, a library table, a good set of up-to-date maps, ji good globe, and good blackboard. The sand table, a bulletin board, a bul - letin rack, a chart printing outfit, adequate primary supplies, and tools for woodwork are now a part of the regular equipment. Our Nebraska school laws provide that flag poles shall be erected and maintained in all school districts and that the national flag of the United States of America shall be conspicuously and continuously displayed on the interior wall of every schoolroom and chapel of public school buildings of the state of Nebraska. A musical instrument is essential in the rural schools. Music should be a part of the rural school program. A child turns to music as a natural expression of beauty, grace, rhythm, and the joy of living. "More music, less crime," said Burns. The county and state rural school choirs, singing at eighth grade pro - motion exercises, at county fairs, state fairs, and Christmas programs, have delighted their audiences with the beautiful tone quality that has been de - veloped in the singing of the boys and girls by the rural school chorus method. Mr. Howard Kirkpatrick, director of the University of Nebraska School of Music, believes that the rural school choir plan will solve the problem of how to get music to the one-room schoolhouse and that the future of music even in higher institutions depends very largely upon interesting the youth of the state in music. The child responds unconsciously to the beautiful. A schoolroom deco - rated in soft coloring with growing flowers here and there, with two or three fine pictures on die walls, has been found to have a most desirable influence on pupils. It is undesirable to have too many pictures in a room. It is •From address delivered nt St. I.ouis meeting c.r the X.K.A. Department of Superintendence. February 20, 1930, by Director of Itur:,!

            <seg id="p149">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION better to have a few good pictures and to have them mean something to the pupils. All pictures should be of such a nature as to contribute to the restfulness of a room. Pictures that show cruelty, grief, or suffering are not good pictures for children. ■■ A study of masterpieces and of the ideals of the artists who created them may have a part in character building. For illustration, hope may be made a part of one's character by a study of the "Song of the Lark" by Breton. Gratitude may be taught dirough a study of "The Angelus" by Millet. Farm work may be dignified by a study of the picture "Behind the Plow" by Lucy Kemp-Welch. The thought of kindness and reverence will be with the pupils when diey study "Sistine Madonna" by Raphael. The lesson of thrift may be developed from "The Gleaners" by Millet. Courage is personified in. "Sir Galahad" by Watts. Purity is typified in the "Age of Innocence" by Reynolds. Respect and patriotism may be inculcated in the pupils by a study of the pictures of Washington and Lincoln and many ethers. Delaware rural teachers are paid in accordance with the same salary schedule as village or town teachers except that rural teachers who rank A or B in their efficiency are given a bonus for teaching in rural schools, depending upon the distance the school is from the railroad, trolley or bus line. The Delaware recognition of rural teachers is a challenge to Nebraska. Our great task at the present time is to take the rural school as it is and to make it the best school that can be made. It is of interest to know that during the past eight years our department has distributed 62,000 manuals in the interests of rural education. With the cooperation of the county superintendents and local school officials we have better supervision and more efficient teaching in the rural schools. We have an increased number of standard and superior rural schools furnished with adequate libraries and healthful equipment. By means of greater cooperation between home and school, rural education is moving forward toward the goal: For every child a school that is safe from hazards, sanitary, well lighted, ventilated, equipped for health and for the finest type of instruction! HOME AND SCHOOL COOPERATION HOME AND SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONS Interest in a better rural school program has been brought about by community organizations and patrons' organizations considering the needs of the children and working on a program of child welfare and school improvement. We have found that the most effective means of advancing rural education is through local leadership. Although developing sentiment takes time, it makes for growth, satisfaction, and permanence in the end, </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT and is in accordance with the guiding principles followed by Horace Mann, viz.: "Education can never be attained in a republic without the consent of the whole people. All improvements in the school suppose and require a corresponding and simultaneous improvement in public sentiment." Inten - sive efforts are being made on the part of the State Department and county superintendents to stimulate within our state a public sentiment and desire for better schools. With the public's good will, a school system can do almost anything. Without it, little can be accomplished. The life of the community may be measured by the vision, ideals, and sympathetic coop - erative interests of its people. Desirable citizens are attracted by a growing, alert, wide-awake neighborhood where diere is real leadership and a well - balanced community development program in operation, and where there is a united interest in securing the best things in life. Our experience has proved that the rural people of the various communi - ties are glad and willing, in the great majority of cases, to improve their schools as far as economic factors make it reasonably possible for them to do so. Therefore, we have urged and encouraged the forming of Parent- Teacher Associations, community centers, and kindred organizations that are interested in the home and school. Discussion material for these organizations has been prepared by the Director of Rural Education for the purpose of bringing about a better understanding of the problems and needs of the child by patrons and teachers organized for the purpose of child development. Among the discussion topics are: safety, fire prevention, reading, how the home may cooperate in the formation of better study habits, development in play, music in the rural schools, thrift and child development, scientific temperance instruction, citizenship ideals taught in the home and school, standards for rural schools, dignity and necessity of common labor, honesty is the only policy, respect for parents and the home, and health. The Parent-Teacher Association is one of the most important agencies for in - terpreting to the school patrons the aims and needs of the schools. Encourage - ment and support of progressive school policies may be counted on from parents who take interest in the schools their children attend and who participate actively in the work of the Parent-Teacher Association. It is not enough that teachers be concerned with educational results. The legislator, the teacher, the parents, and other taxpayers must work together for a unified, balanced educational program. In order for this to be done, all groups should be in full possession of facts in regard to the schools. Legislators are earnestly desirous of doing the thing that will do the greatest good for the greatest number. One thousand two hundred twenty-seven districts participated in Parent-Teacher Association and similar community organizations last year, as given in Table Number One. </seg>
            <seg id="p151">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION This division has assisted in the promoting of community recreation including school fairs, harvest festivals, county-wide pageants, and educational parades. Nine hundred one districts participated during the biennium in educational pageants or parades. The themes of several of the pageants or parades are: "Pioneer Days," "March of the Nations," "Procession of States,' "Health Parade," "Spirit of Progress," "Carnival of the Holi - days," "Old-Time Songs," and "Fiftieth Anniversary Pageant." PATRONS' DAY In order that patrons may know the school and understand the prob - lems, needs, objectives, and achievements of the school,; Patrons' Day is quite generally observed in the rural schools. Two thousand nine hundred twenty teachers reported observance of Patrons' Day last year (Table Number One). School officers and all patrons were urged to visit their respective schools on Patrons' Day for the purpose of hearing pupils in their everyday recitations. EDUCATIONAL PREPARATION OF RURAL TEACHERS IN FIFTY-NINE COUNTIES 1934-35 This report is based on the information sent directly to this office by 3.325 rural teachers who are teaching in 59 counties in Nebraska, as given in Table Number Four. Of the 3,325 teachers whose reports were compiled, Table Number Four, 2,349, or 70.6 per cent, were graduates of the normal training courses in the high schools of Nebraska; 576, or 17.3 per cent, have had no college training; 1,203, or 36.2 per cent, had less than 35 weeks of college training; and 1,546, or 46.5 per cent, had more than one year of college training. Of these 3,325 teachers (in 59 counties, we find that 803, or 24.2 per cent, had two years or more of college training; 294, or 8.9 per cent, had three years or more of college training while 151, or 4.6 per cent, had four years or more of college training. In considering this study, teacher progress and growth may be com - mended when economic conditions and Nebraska drouths are taken into account. </seg>

Bowers, Assistant Director CONTENTS—-Introduction—Recent Studies in Secondary Education —High School Inspection—High School Accreditment—North Central As - sociation—Approved Non-Accredited High Schools—High School Normal Training. ■ ''.' ' i I Introduction The functions of this Department are to assist in every possible way in the improvement of the instruction in the secondary schools of Nebraska and to further the rural teacher-training program. In performing these func - tions 'we have the co-operation of those in charge of the University of Ne - braska, the county superintendents, and the Department of Rural Education. Nebraska at the present time has a progressive leadership in the field of secondary education, which is thoroughly aware of the problems confronting the secondary schools of the state. Economic conditions during the past five years have greatly hindered reorganization and enrichment of the curricul.i offerings in our high schools. Our educators are, however, thoroughly alive to the need of a program which will more adequately meet the needs of their pupils and are making the necessary changes as fast as financial conditions permit. A survey of the secondary schools of the United States is being conducted at the present time by the American Council of Education, with the purpose of evolving a new yardstick for measuring the efficiency of secondary schools. Five Nebraska high schools are co-operating in this survey: namely, Hastings, Stromsburg and Greenwood in the central and eastern part of the state, and Alliance and Kimball in the western part. There are 200 high schools co - operating in die United States, representing four types of high schools. If this survey accomplishes its purpose, schools everywhere in the United States can be accredited more accurately. Recent Studies in Secondary Education Before considering some of the problems which confront secondary education.and the attempts which are being made to solve diem, it might be well to glance at the very real advances that have been made within die past twenty years. In die first place, the machinery of education; i. e., buildings and equipment, has been enormously enlarged. Then, too, both the selec - tion and die organization of subject matter have shown vast improvement. Except in some small schools, discipline has ceased to be a problem. No longer is it necessary to force boys and girls to attend high school, but, on thz contrary, diey usually consider it a real deprivation if financial or other rea- </seg>
            <seg id="p165">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION sons prevent their attendance. Music has assumed a much more important place in the curriculum. A new introductory subject, general science, has been generally adopted, and the field of education has been vastly extended, often through extracurricular activities. Most important of all, methods of teaching have improved greatly. We have a right to congratulate ourselves upon these improvements, hut must not close our eyes to what remains to be done. Our most thoughtful educators and laymen alike realize that our secondary schools, as they are now conducted, fail to meet adequately the needs of a large pro - portion of the six million boys and girls now in attendance upon them. Dr. Thomas H. Briggs of Teachers College, Columbia University, says; "By any reasonable criterion the investment by the public in our secondary education has failed to pay academic and social dividends that justify the high expendi - tures of time, effort, and money." Dr. Rainey, Director of the American Youth Commission, states: "We have figures which indicate that our cur - ricula and courses of study are ill-adapted and ill-suited to as much as 60 per cent of the population now enrolled in the secondary schools." Criticism by authorities as well qualified as these and by many others equally familiar with the situation lead us to inquire whether there are any reasons why the efforts that have been put forth and the money that has been spent have not produced greater results. It is the opinion of this de - partment that the fundamental difficulty is, and has always been, that there is a disagreement as to the purpose of the high school. Dr. Briggs very neatly makes this point when he defines our secondary schools as "the complex institution that attempts at the same time the dual task of being a terminal school for some and a preparatory school for others." The second difficulty lies in the great increase in the number of pupils and. more especially, in the change of character of the student body as die result of the addition of these masses. In 1915 only 15 per cent of those of secondary school age were enrolled in our high schools; today at least 60 per cent are enrolled. If we believe in the American ideal of an education for every boy and girl, we cannot but rejoice that 60 per cent of our youth are now enrolled in secondary institutions and that the number is still increasing at the rate of about 2 per cent per year. Nevertheless, this rapid increase in such a short time has brought with it problems such as educators have probably never faced before. A third cause of the meager results attained by many high schools lies in the fact that teachers, patrons and general public are too satisfied with tradition. "Most innovations must be tacked on to the traditional program, without disturbing it very much. The extra-curricular activities superficial though many of them are, have to 'boodeg' their innovations, as Bagley has said, into the program."* However, is it not true that human beings are generally satisfied with what they have until they see something better? It is the task of educators, with the assistance of other leaders of thought, to •Hrlprprs, '•Secondary Kdurntioii," p. (155. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT decide what this "something better" is and then to demonstrate it so con - vincingly that patrons and public will come to believe in the soundness of the plan. With this end in view several fact-finding invesrigations have been carried on and at the present time many studies and experiments are in prog - ress, which are being watched with intense interest by educators, and, in fact, by all who concern themselves with the problems of youth. A survey was made under the leadership of Dr. Leonard V. Koos of the University of Chicago, at the suggestion of the North Central Association. Funds for this survey were appropriated by Congress, to be used over a period of three years. A report was published in 1933 which contains vast amounts of information about the present status of secondary education. This survey furnishes a basis of fact for other investigations and experiments, and also points out the lines along which future investigations should proceed. It was reviewed briefly by this department in the last Biennial Report. One of the most far-reaching attempts to survey the basic principles of secondary education was initiated a little more than three years ago by the Department of Secondary School Principals of the N. E. A. This depart - ment appointed a committee of eleven persons with Dr. Thomas H. Briggs as Chairman and, besides appropriating money from its own funds, secured a subvention from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teach - ing. This committee devoted to the enterprise what has been computed to be about #30,000 worth of the time of its members. The subject of the first half of its report states The Issues of Secondary Education. There are ten of these issues: Issue I.—Shall secondary education be provided at public expense for all normal individuals or for only a limited number? Issue II.—Shall secondary education seek to retain all pupils in school as long as they wish to remain, or shall it transfer them to other agencies under educational supervision when, in the judgment of the school authorities, these agencies promise to serve better the pupils' immediate and probable future needs? Issue III.—Shall secondary education be concerned only with the wel - fare and progress of the individual, or with these only as they promise to contribute to the welfare and progress of society? Issue IV.—Shall secondary education provide a common curriculum for all, or differentiated offerings? Issue V.—Shall secondary education include vocational training, or shall it be restricted to general education? Issue VI.—Shall secondary education be primarily directed toward preparation for advanced studies, or shall it be primarily concerned with the value of its own courses, regardless of a student's future academic career? </seg>
            <seg id="p167">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Issue VII.—Shall secondary education accept conventional school sub - jects as fundamental categories under which school experiences shall be classi - fied nnd presented to students, or shall it arrange and present experiences in fundamental categories directly related to the performance of such functions of secondary schools in a democracy as increasing the ability and die desire better to meet socio-civic, economic, health, leisure time, vocational and pre - professional problems and situations? Issue VIII.—Shall secondary education present merely organized knowledge, or shall it also assume responsibility for attitudes and ideals? Issue IX.—Shall secondary education seek merely die adjustment of students to prevailing social ideals, or shall it seek the reconstruction of society? Issue X. —Granting tJiat education is a "gradual, continuous, unitary process," shall secondary education be presented merely as a phase of such a process, or shall it be organized as a distinct educational program, widi peculiarly emphasized functions of its own? The committee has formulated diese ten issues in an attempt to survey the philosophical bases of die curriculum. Dr. Briggs, the chairman of the committee, feels that "there can be no truly effective science of education without a foundation in philosophy, a systematic ordering of faiths, and hopes and asperations." It is his opinion that in the near future education will enter upon an extensive program of comprehensive planning. That a com - mission composed of educators, philosophers, sociologists, economists, and others of learning, wisdom, and wide experience will find and frankly face all the issues that now exist or will develop in theory and in practice. Such a commission will be a full-time body, for the task is too big for any one man or for any small group of men who attempt to do it at odd times. Costly though it might seem, such a group working in the service of the whole nation, would be more economical than hundreds or thousands of less competent groups working less effectively, and reperitiously, at the present time. However, at the present, we have no such central planning commission nnd many independent groups are engaged in investigation and in working out experiments of various kinds. No doubt a central plannning commis - sion, if we have one in the future, will be able to make use of the results they obtain. Thirty schools which are members of the 'Progressive Education Associa - tion are carrying on an eight-year experiment that has attracted such favorable notice that two of the great foundations have supplied ample means for carrying out the enterprise, including an elaborate plan for evaluating the results. This experiment has two hopes. One of them is that out of diis experiment, or rather, these experiments, there may come a body of evidence which will be accepted by the colleges, to show that the colleges do not need to dictate die preparatory curriculum, but diat they can get evidence in other ways as to the fitness of the individual to do college work. Certain studies </seg>
            <seg id="p168">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT of prediction of success in college, notably those of Henmon and Holt of the University of Wisconsin, and of David Segel in the Office of Education, point out that it is possible, by means of tests and questionnaires to get a description of a given pupil which is quite valid in predicting his academic success. The second hope is that diere may come out of these various ex - periences certain new curriculum units of demonstrated value, to be offered to secondary schools generally, for certain definite purposes. For example, at the University High School at Ohio State University, a course is being carried on in thinking, in the basis of proof, centered about mathematics, but extending generally to other kinds of thinking. At New Trier High School, near Winnetka, Illinois. Mr. Gaffney has been interested in the integration of social studies and English. At Roosevelt High School, in Des Moines, Mr. Stoneseifer is seeing what can be done with a corre - spondence curriculum. Space does not permit the mention of hundreds of high schools which are attempting to revise their courses in such a manner as to promote the mental and physical growth of their pupils and give them die best possible preparation for participating in present and future social^ political, economic and leisure affairs. The North Central Association has several committees at work upon different phases of secondary education. One of these is known as the Com - mittee on Functional Organization of Secondary School Curricula. This committee is attempting "to organize units of instruction in terms of out - comes being sought instead of in terms of bodies of subject matter," to quote Dr. John E. Stout of Northwestern University, a member of the com - mittee. The units of instruction take their names from the objectives of secondary education, rather than from subjects or even fields of knowledge. Consequently they are named health, use of leisure time, vocational informa - tion and skills, and social relationships. Mr. H. H. Ryan, Principal of the High School of the University of Wisconsin, who is a member of the above committee, is experimenting in die use of these four functional units. About twenty pupils from each of the three upper classes make up the experimental group; and an equal number of approximately the same level of ability, who are taking the conventional cur - riculum, compose a control group. The first group of the experimental curriculum was graduated in the spring of 1936, and their progress in die university will be closely followed and compared with the achievements of their control group. The progress of this work has been studied by various members of the committee, and the apparent success of the enterprise has re - sulted in the extension of the expriment into a number or c:'.-.cr schools. Mr. Ryan described the methods he is using in carrying en this experi - ment at the Third Annual All-State Educational Conference, held at the University of Nebraska on June 23, 24 and 25, 1936. His two addresses, as well as other discussions of problems in secondary education given at this Conference, have been published and are available through the Extension Division of the University of Nebraska. The director of this departm *nt </seg>
            <seg id="p169">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ■ recommends this report to all superintendents and principals who were unable to attend the Conference. Of especial interest is the discussion of "Curric - ular Enrichment Through Extension", given by Mr. Earl T. Platt, Assistant Director of Supervised Correspondence Study of the University of Nebraska, and of "Functioning Guidance Programs in Small Schools", by Dr. Knute O. Broady, Professor of School Administration of the University of Ne - braska. Among the developments that have taken place in the field of second - ary education during the past ten years the one that perhaps holds the greatest number of possibilities for the improvement of the small school is the procedure known as Supervised Correspondence Study. Our own state has been especially active in developing and promoting this new technique of instruction, which is administered by the extension department of the Uni - versity of Nebraska. Although the system has been in operation only a few years, the number of pupils enrolled in the courses shows a health)' increase each year. The enrollment by years in Nebraska and a further dis - cussion of this procedure is given elsewhere in this report. In general, most of the types of reorganization of curricula now under way are similar to the functional type in one particular; viz., the tendency to ignore in part at least the traditional division of fields and subjects. One school offers a course in science in the freshman year, the purpose of which is stated as follows: "This course is designed to familiarize the student with some of the most significant contributions of modern science to everyday living. All material is selected with reference to this purpose and no recog - nition is given to the various sciences supplying the content of the course." A further example of this tendency is presented in a series of courses offered in the freshman and sophomore years of a higher institution under the caption "Current or Public Affairs." The separate course titles indicate the absence of the recognition of traditional subjects or even fields of knowledge. An organization, not strictly educational in its nature, which has the best interests of American youth at heart is the American Youth Commis - sion. This commission is undertaking to make an evaluation of the goals of our secondary school system, and also a careful study of the relationship of the schools to business and industry, which involves the whole problem of vocational education and guidance. The Commission is being assisted in its task by Dr. Harl R. Douglass of the University of Minnesota, who pre - pared for it a Monograph on Secondary Education in which he set forth the major issues involved and a series of recommendations concerning proced - ures which should be followed. It is his suggestion that a truly sound program of education for at least half our youth would be one in which the student, after the age of six - teen or thereabouts, would spend about half his time with the regular school program and the remainder of his rime at outside employment. There is no doubt but that a ptcgram of this sort would be much more attractive to many boys and girls than the regular type of school program. Several </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT schools in the country are, at the present time, giving this type of program and a small beginning has been made in Nebraska, in the Smith-Hughes high schools. The Civilian Conservation Corps was an attempt to answer this demand of youth for something to do, though it had other purposes as well. Inefrour-H dubs are another illustration of the type of education in which youth learn by doing. The outstanding success of both of these movements proves the need of something of the sort. Though there are many difficulties attached to planning a work program in connection with the public schools, there is no doubt but that more could be done along thi; line. Dr. Samuel Everett of Northwestern University feels that the school must decide whether its function is to pass on a cultural heritage handed down from the past or to deal with present-day individual and social needs; that it will find it impossible to do both. He has illustrated this conflict of purposeby contrasting the aims of the older school with what he thinks will be the aims of the modern school: 1. The older school has emphasized 1.

The great amount of time and thought that is being devoted to the study of our secondary school problems cannot but bear fruit in some very real improvement in the type of training to be given our youth in the future. Secondary education is the most important unit in our educational scheme. True, in its present unsettled state, it makes enormous demands upon those who are attempting to administer it. But it is just these changing and ever - expanding demands that offer such a challenge to teachers and administrators alike. In the past, far too many girls have rushed into an ill-considered mar - riage or have taken some cheap job; too many boys have accepted the first opportunity for work, whether congenial or not, or have joined the groups </seg>

However, the previous year also showed an increase of about 3 per cent in number of teachers over the preceding year, following two years in which the trend was downward. Thus far the increase in teachers has not kept pace with the increased enrollment. The last biennial report showed that the number of graduates from accredited high schools had decreased slightly. This decrease continued through 1934-35, but the past year showed 419 more graduating than in May, 1935.

This large non-resident enrollment presents a real challenge to our lawmakers and' educational leaders to provide a type of education that will prepare these young people for the life they are to live. The total enrollment in both accredited and non-accredited high schools in Nebraska in 1933-34 was 74,953. The enrollment for 1935-36 was 80,583, .in increase of 7% per cent during the biennium or somewhat less than 4 per rent per year. The increase in the continental United States during die same period was twelve per cent, or 6 per cent per year. However, the enrollment in Nebraska high schools in comparison to population has always been much larger than the enrollment for the United States as a whole, as shown else - where in this report, so that it is not surprising that our high schools have not shown as large an increase as the industrial states where attendance has been low in the past. The reorganization of high schools in Nebraska which took place so rapidly during the decade of the twenties has slowed down somewhat during the thirties, due largely to financial conditions. The great majority of the small high schools of Nebraska are still operated under die 8-4 plan. A very few use the 6-2-4 plan, about twenty die 6-3-3 plan, and forty the 6-6 plan. Only two school systems, those of Scottsbluff and McCook, operate junior col - leges. The 6-6 plan seems to be growing more rapidly in Nebraska than any other plan, probably because it is better adapted to die schools found in Nebras - ka. The change from die 8-4 to die 6-6 plan enables a school to offer a broader program of studies, more vocational work, and more extra-curricular activities. It is gratifying to note that many of our high schools have extended their programs during the past two years in keeping with the newer philosophy of education. The subject matter fields making the greatest net gains by die addition of new subjects are the following in die order named: Commercial subjects, music, manual training, the sciences, home economics, physical edu - cation, the social sciences and guidance or orientation courses. The only subject which has shown a definite loss is Latin. This information was gained through a very recent study made by die Nebraska State Teachers Association, of 323 schools of all sizes, which in - cluded 177 schools employing less than eleven teachers. For die years 1935-36 nr.d 1936-37. ■ 11 schools employing over 46 teachers have added 16 new courses, 17 schools employing 21 to 45 teachers have added 29 new courses, 77 schools employing 11 to 20 teachers have added 99 new courses, 177 schools employing 4 to 10 teachers have added 233 new courses, 33 schools employing 3 or less teachers have added 17 new courses. Some of these schools are extending their program of work in these fields rather than initiating the course for the first time. For example, out of die </seg>
            <seg id="p174">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 56 schools naming music as an addition to the curriculum, some have had grade music and are now extending it to the high school, or vice versa, or some have had vocal music and are now adding instrumental music. Of course, the total number of new courses added for the two years. 403, is only an average of slightly over one course per school, and yet it is encouraging that the schools have been able to do even this much under the conditions which have prevailed. It at least represents a trend which will grow stronger as financial conditions improve. It is to be noted that the schools employing three or less teachers have not made as good a showing as the larger schools in the adding of new courses. We must recognize the fact that these small schools will never be able to offer the same type or quality of program as the larger schools unless a more liberal plan of state support is provided. Eighty Nebraska high schools are at the present time offering Smith- Hughes agriculture, while about thirty offer one year of agriculture and many others have at least one semester. Sixty-five schools have Smith-Hughes home economics courses, and a few others offer good courses which do not quite meet the Smith-Hughes requirements. In addition, many smaller high schools offer one semester either in cooking or in sewing. A large majority of Nebraska high schools offer manual training, the course varying from one semester to a full two-year course. Home eco - nomics and manual training were both dropped by many schools during the recent depression, but are now being replaced as rapidly as boards of edu - cation find it possible to do so. Some typing is offered in a large majority of high schools and thorough commercial courses are given in many schools. There came recently from the federal division of vocational education a report that too many high school pupils are studying shorthand, typewriting, and bookkeeping, and too few are studying salesmanship and certain trades. The typical-city illustra - tion shows that, of 350 pupils who took shorthand, only 88 secured positions calling for the use of shorthand without further training. On the other hand, 522 or 10 per cent of the high school graduates in that city became clerks or salespeople in stores —and yet only twenty of these took courses in retail selling. It would certainly be wise for the school administration to make a canvass of opportunities in the community before deciding upon vocational courses to be offered in the high school. We are glad to be able to report that music is, year' by year, assuming a more important place in our high schools. In fact, no other subject seems to be making as rapid a growth. There is no doubt but that our district and state music contests have had much to do with the increased popularity of this valuable subject. The radio has no doubt played its part as well. There has been a slight increase during the biennium in the number of schools offering physical training for girls. A very few schools have </seg>
            <seg id="p175">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION well-organized programs, but the majority of Nebraska high schools are weak in their health programs. There is need of a well organized and well written course of study in health education. This the revised High School Manual will undertake to provide. Many of our high schools do not possess adequate library facilities. If we are going to insist upon a broad preparation for life we must have varied reference material, catalogued and properly shelved, easily accessible to students and instructors alike. As soon as financial conditions improve this is one of the first matters that should receive the attention of those in charge of our high schools. This year for the first time there has been prepared, under the joint direction of the State Department of Public Instruction and the University of Nebraska, a course in safety education, for the use of the high schools of Nebraska. It is vigorously urged that all high schools make use of it in nn effort to reduce the appalling accident rate which now prevails through - out Nebraska and the nation. There has been a marked improvement in the qualifications of teachers employed in Nebraska high schools. The percentage of teachers holding masters' degrees has increased considerably, while the number of principals and superintendents who have masters' degrees is increasing at a rapid rate. The time is not far distant when all superintendents and principals of accredited schools will hold the advanced degree. Teachers' salaries have improved somewhat over die low point of the depression, but have not yet returned to the pre-depression level. The lengthened class period is consistently growing in favor. Probably 10 per cent of Nebraska high schools now operate on a class schedule of fifty-five or more minutes. There are not over twenty-five high schools in Nebraska which have a well developed guidance program at the present time and these are the larger high schools. However, several of our smaller high schools report having introduced courses of this kind during the past two years. It seems that diis is one field in which the smaller schools might do some very effective work. The small school is not operating at a disadvantage when it attempts to offer guidance to its pupils, but, as a matter of fact, has important advantages over the large school because of the closer contact between teacher and pupils. Every school in the state should have a guid - ance program, beginning in the ninth grade and continuing through high school. Educ.ition.il Monograph No. 9, published by the Extension Division of the University of Nebraska, contains a most helpful article by Dr. Knute O. Broady of the University of Nebraska, entitled "Functioning Guidance Programs in Small Schools." We feel sure that Dr. Broady will </seg>
            <seg id="p176">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT be glad to assist anyone who wishes to set up a guidance program in his school. The Extension Department of the University of Nebraska makes it possible, by means of its Supervised Correspondence Courses, for high schools to extend their number of subject offerings, and thus take better care of the needs of their young people. The number of high schools that have taken advantage of these courses during the last two years is as follows: 1934-1935 1935-1936 Approved schools (4 Yr.) 3 3 Minor accredited schools 3 8 Fully accredited schools 58 90 Total - 64 101 The department also served quite a number of other approved schools which did not have four years of work. Thus we see that there was a substantial increase in die number of students enrolled in Supervised Correspondence Courses during the past year over die preceding year. In addition, approximately sixty students who were not able to attend any high school have returned to die rural eight-grade schools in dieir neighborhoods to carry, under the supervision of the rural teacher, high school subjects through Supervised Correspondence Study. Besides enriching the curriculum, other advantages of this procedure are: 1. It cares for the gifted pupil by giving him an opportunity to do work along the line of his special talent. 2. It cares for the slow disinter - ested, retarded and irregular pupils. In a correspondence course such a pupil.can proceed at his own speed. He can also take subjects which interest him more than do those of the regular curriculum. 3. It provides voca - tional training. The high school at Benton Harbor, Michigan, is the out - standing high school for the use of Supervised Correspondence Study for vocational training. This senior high school, of approximately 700 students, has been using the system for the past thirteen years, and during the year 1935-1936 hadf 216 pupils enrolled in 37 different courses. 4. It provides help for the graduate and die adult. 5. It cares for the incapacitated pupil. 6. It cares for other pupils who do not have the opportunity of attending a secondary school because of financial or other reasons. It has been men - tioned above that sixty pupils of this type took advantage of correspondence instruction during the year 1935-1936. 7. It offers help for the one-, two-, and three-year high school. 8. It offers a practical way of offering high school courses during the summer. Supervised Correspondence Study is also reducing the lag between need for curriculum revision and its actual accomplishment. The Extension Department, of which Dr. A. A. Reed is the Director, is serving not only Nebraska high schools but many high schools in other states. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION It would seem that this service which is offered by the University of Nebraska will come to be utilized more freely by our smaller high schools, especially, as they begin to realize its real importance. A new commission has been selected to revise the High School Manual under the direction of the State Department of Public Instruction and the University of Nebraska. The personnel of this commission is: Dr. A. A. Reed, University Examiner, Chairman; Dr. G. W. Rosenlof, Dept. of Secondary Education, University of Nebraska;Dr. W. H. Morton, Dept. of Secondary Education, University of Nebraska; Principal R. M. Marrs, Omaha; Principal Glen Hildreth, Fremont; Principal P. W. Handy, Grand Island; Dr. C. F. Dienst, Deputy State Superintendent; Mr. F. E. Bowers, Supervisor in Secondary Education; Mr. J. C. Mitchell, Director of Second - ary Education and Teacher Training. The work of actual revision will be assigned to people well prepared by training and experience in their respective fields. HIGH SCHOOL INSPECTION The discussion of the subject of high school inspection, if carried to' its completion and considered in all of its details, would require far more space than is allotted in this report and would perhaps tax the interest of the readers beyond the point of justification. We can at best make a hasty survey of some of the objectives and purposes of such high school inspection ns carried on through the agencies of the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Authority for such high school inspection is by law vested in the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Two general purposes are satisfied—one, the determination of high school accreditment as finally recognized by the University authorities, and, second, the de - termination of approval to receive not only state apportionments but to receive state aid in connection with the program of high school normal training. Speaking of the purposes of high school inspection from the stand - point of high school accreditment, it is well to say that this responsibility is, in a measure, a joint responsibility of the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the University authorities. Not so many years ago, two sets of high school visitors, or inspectors as they have been commonly called, were employed in Nebraska. The University had its group, and this office had its group. There was manifestly a very serious duplication of effort. By agreement with the University authorities and this office, it was concluded that the reports of the officials representing the State Department of Public Instruction would be accepted by the University authorities—they in turn to give up the high school inspection program. Educational leaders agree that high school inspection, either by the State Department of Public Instruction or by those charged with accredit- </seg>
            <seg id="p178">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ing high schools to the University, should have for its purpose the arousal of interest in training pupils in proper habits of study. It has long been felt by college and university instructors that one of the greatest hindrances to the success of freshman students is the fact that they do not seem to know how to study properly. As a result, much of their time during this critical first year must be spent in unlearning many of the old habits and ways of doing and acquiring and learning new and proper habits of study procedure. If high school inspection can in any way help these people to form correct study habits in the secondary schools, then, certainly, the inspection program is at least partially justified. Improvement of the quality of care and upkeep of buildings should very definitely come out of a program of high school inspection. Very frequently, administrative heads, superintendents of schools and supervisors are confronted by conditions with respect to janitorial service that are most unfortunate. Frequently, incompetent men are employed as building custodians and janitors simply because they are in need of employment or because they have certain influences in the community that are felt to be important factors from a political point of view or a selfish end. Too often, these men are in nowise capable of doing the jobs that ought to be done. Buildings become filthy, increased fire hazards result, unsanitary conditions exist, and an environment which is frequently unwholesome to young men and young women results. Local authorities many times find it exceedingly embarrassing and quite impossible to change these situations without being misunderstood and criticized unjustly. Many occasions are afforded for high school inspectors to advise with the board of education in an impersonal manner and, with an impersonal point of view, call atten - tion of the board and those in authority to the need for change. School authorities very frequently lose sight of the fact that the great - est single factor in character building is to be found in the school environ - ment. They sometimes lose sight of the fact that clean habits of thinking and living can best be insured in clean surroundings. Buildings that are clean and sanitary and healthful ought to be provided in every community. It would seem that with the cooperation of high school inspectors there would be no excuse for any school plant not being 100 per cent perfect in this regard. This office seeks at all times to direct attention to the need of better care and upkeep of buildings and the improvement of those conditions that lead to wholesome sanitary surroundings. One might also suggest very properly here the importance of these factors in building up the health pro - gram of the community. Another purpose of high school inspection is that of advising with and bringing to the attention of administrative authorities the best practices in vogue with respect to curricular offerings in our high schools. This is particularly important in connection with the smaller high schools of the state. It is very natural, and to be expected, that the superintendents in the local communities are ambitious and desirous of building up the strongest </seg>
            <seg id="p179">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION possible course of study for the boys and girls of the community. It some - times happens that the curricular offerings are too ambitious and that the small community attempts to do more than the economic situation and the population of the school justify. The high school inspector often serves as a safety valve in guiding these superintendents and principals and leading them to see the limits to go in providing an adequate educational program. From an economic point of view, there is a very definite relationship between pupil enrollments, the number of teachers employed, the financial status of the community, and the number of subjects offered. High school inspectors can advise with those in charge as to the distribution of the teaching load, the combination and alternation of subject matter courses, and the limitation of certain courses to particular groups of students. Again, high school inspectors are by law required to call attention of all authorities to law violations. This office never has nor does it contem - plate in the future using a big stick, so to speak, in forcing the schools to recognize statutory limitations or statutory provisions. It is presumed that our province is merely to call attention to the statutes covering the many phases of school administration and supervision and remind those responsible for their observance as to what should be done. One of the most frequent services which this office has been called upon to render has been that of advising as to statutory provisions pertaining to the certification of teachers and to the normal training program in the high schools of the state. The normal training high schools in Nebraska, numbering almost two hundred, are governed by some very definite and specific normal training regulations, these regulations having in a very certain and real sense the effect of law. It is always our purpose to advise ond counsel and never to exercise any legislative authorities. There are so many problems involved in the high school normal training program that time docs not permit us to enumerate them here. In Nebraska, it is felt, so far as this administration is concerned, that among the most important objectives to be attained in our high school inspection is that of informing high school authorities concern - ing ideals, standards and good practice in school organization and management, r.nd to encourage the adoption of these ideals, standards and practices. The high school inspector occupies a most unique position in this regard and one which he is happy to occupy since it is in his power to bring to the immediate attention of the board of education and the teacher a broad point of view with respect to successful practices as directed throughout the state. In a very real sense, the inspector assists in determining new standards and higher ideals. He advises very properly with respect to methods of teaching, tech - niques for handling classes, and principles involved in carrying out any extra - curricular program. Because of his desire to be of such assistance and be - cause of the fact that it is the policy of this office to ev^r stand in the place of one who truly occupies an advisory relationship, there has come to exist </seg>
            <seg id="p180">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT mote and more a much finer spirit between this office and the teachers and superintendents in the field. It was one time thought that supervision of die State Department of Public Instruction was for the purpose of pointing out the errors and faults. Supervision, when thought of as an agency for the improvement of teaching, no longer becomes an activity of this sort. On die odier hand, it is being recognized more and more as a very valuable adjunct and aid to the local school authorities in bringing about desired results as to better teaching. The high school inspector is a co-worker in every sense of die word and desires at all times to be of assistance in making die school more efficient and in guiding those who are teaching in such a way as to make their work more effective in the education of the youdi of die state. Directing attention to methods and plans for super - vision of classroom instruction is certainly an important task of the high school inspector. In his position as such, he frequendy can bring about more effectively and decisively desired results than can anyone who is in imme - diate authority. This is largely due to the fart that all of his supervision is supposedly impersonal. The fart that the high school inspector is in touch daily with the very best practices diroughout the state gives him op - portunity to become acquainted with successful practices in a manner im - possible to any other person. ' Again, we are finding it more and more necessary to give attention to the problem of improved library facilities. Perhaps no other agency is quite so important a supplement to classroom teaching as is the service that can be rendered by a live and growing library. No other part of the school's equipment is receiving so much attention today, perhaps, as is the library. This office is very definitely committed to a program of better library fa - cilities, and our people are constantly calling to attention the need for im - proving these facilities throughout the state. Very frequendy, we are called upon to advise with respect to college entrance requirements and courses of study in higher institutions of learning. We are always ready to give to those inquiring after such information the benefit of our best experience and knowledge. We would not close diis brief discussion without paying our respects to die several thousands of high school teachers, supervisors and administrators with whom we come in contact annually. Nebraska should be proud of her fine teaching corps. Our teachers in the public schools in Nebraska need not hold a second place to any similar group in any other state. We believe in their inherent quality of leadership. We have faith in their ability to meet every challenge which confronts them, and we know that there is no finer work being done by any organization or group of individuals in the development of fine young men and young women—men and women of character and potential leadership—than is being done by the teachers in our secondary schools. We cannot close without expressing, too, our apprecia - tion of diat growing spirit of cooperation which is characterizing the re - lations of this office to the schools of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p181">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION High School Accreditment The University of Nebraska maintains a list of accredited schools, the graduates of which are admitted to the University (and to nearly all of the colleges and universities of die United States) without entrance ex - aminations in subjects that are properly certified as completed within these schools. Unless a graduate of an accredited school, a candidate for ad - mission must be prepared to take examination in those subjects in which en - trance credits are desired; provided that graduates of non-accredited four - year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examination by passing an intelligence test with a standing that shows ability to do die work of a college freshman. "Accredited" schools are such as are found to meet die "Standards of Accredited Schools" to a degree that meets the approval of the University Committee on Accredited Schools. There is now but one list of schools fully accredited to the University of Nebraska. For the convenience of the smaller communities, the University establishes a list of "Minor Accredited Schools", the graduates of which may receive from the senior high school eleven units on credentials giving them conditional admission to college. Additional credits can be secured by completing satisfactorily thirty hours of college work or by examination. Vari - ations from the standards are being permitted to meet local conditions, as may seem proper to the Committee. All standards are considered, and must be met to a reasonable degree. By an arrangement entered into by this department and the University of Nebraska, the University Committee on Accredited Schools receives from and accepts reports of school visitation made by the officials of the State Department of Public Instruction. Report blanks for making application ,ind for setting forth all data necessary to proper consideration of all schools seeking accreditment are prepared joindy, this office being responsible for all administrative and supervisory details connected with the handling of these reports and the program of school visitation. Compiled reports for accreditment of high schools in Nebraska for the biennium 1934 to 1936 are as follows: 1934-35 1935-36 Total Number of Fully Accredited Public High Schools 432 441 Total Number of Minor Accredited Public High Schools 81 71 Total Number of Fully Accredited Private High Schools ..-.. 44 45 Total Number of Minor Accredited Private High Schools 5 5 Grand Total of Accredited Public and Private High Schools - _ 562 562 </seg>

            <seg id="p187">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION North Central Association Another accrediting agency heretofore and at present recognized in Nebraska, as in twenty other North Central states in contiguous territory, is the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The object of this association is that of establishing closer relationships between the secondary schools and the institutions of higher learning within the group of states in the North Central area as well as between other areas of the United States. Membership in this organization is entirely optional and voluntary. It is a mutual society, the Constitution of which provides that all decisions of the association bearing on the policy and management of secondary schools and institutions of higher education are understood to be purely advisory in character. In order to realize the above objectives, several other immediate aims have been set up, among these being the following: First, to bring about a better acquaintance, a keener sympathy and heartier spirit of co - operation among the leaders of the secondary schools and colleges by enabling them to meet at personal conferences at least once a year; second, to encourage the free discussion of common educational problems and to devise ways and means of solving these problems through the exchange of views at confer - ences and through published reports; and, third, to promote the physical, intellectual and moral well-being of students in secondary schools and colleges by calling attention to the need for proper sanitary conditions in school buildings, adequate library and laboratory facilities, defensible curriculum organizations, high standards of scholarship and professional achievement nmong teachers, scientific practices among administrators and, finally, to suggest better ways in which adequate financial support may be given to' the carrying on of the necessary programs of secondary education. As indicated, membership is purely voluntary. There is and can be no compulsion. Any school choosing to become a member of the Association may make application therefore and shall be visited by the proper officials authorized to make such visitations and, having been found to meet the desirable standards or qualifications as set up, will be recognized for approval. The significance of this plan of regional accreditation lies in the fact that the graduates of such institutions as are accredited to the Association are admitted to practically every higher institution of learning in the United States. Neither does this Association seek to control the schools when accredited either as regards dieir course of study, their curriculum, dieir plan of organization for administration and supervision, the personnel of their faculty, or any other of a number of factors generally considered in accreditment relations. This Association has approved the application of 130 public high schools and 13 private high schools in Nebraska. Schools so accredited are indicated on preceding pages and are designated by a dagger placed to the left of the name of each school. </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Approved Non-Accredited High Schools There are to be found in more than three-fourths of the counties of Ne - braska many communities which, because of financial circumstances or because of the small number of students enrolled, are not able to maintain fully accredited high schools. These communities may establish what is known as approved high schools, under jurisdiction of the State Department of Public Instruction. Most of these districts maintain nine and ten grades, while a smaller number maintain eleven and twelve grade programs. The number of ap - proved high schools as of June 1, 1936 totaled 259. Thirty-four of these are four-year high schools; nine are three-year schools; two hundred and one are two-year schools; and fifteen are one-year schools. The number of these approved schools remained practically the same during the present biennium, the number for 1935 being 258. It is true that a few school; have discontinued their programs but enough new ones have been approved to keep the number around 259. The State Department feels that all youth of high school age shouid be given the best high school opportunities obtainable in the community. The interests of pupils must be safeguarded by establishing reasonable standards that are capable of being maintained in these districts which have established approved non-accredited high school programs. The regulations under which these schools operate are such as to cause us to believe that our high school youth may acquire in them a high school education of such quality as to make it possible for them to continue their education in either accredited high schools or in colleges or universities. We feel that these high schools are making a worthwhile contribution to the educational interests of the state. All such high schools complying with the regulations as set up, are privileged to collect high school tuition for non-resident students and are exempt from the payment in whole or in part of the county-wide high school tax .is provided for in Section 79-902 of the Nebraska School Laws. It is entirely within the power of local districts to decide whether or not a high school shall be maintained. It is not within the province of this office to insist upon the maintenance of these schools, nor to insist upon the discontinuance of high school programs after they have been established. It is the function of tiiis office to advise only as to the establishment of such schools. Once they have been established it is our duty to inspect these schools and determine whether or not they are meeting the standards set up for this type of school. Section 79-902 of die Nebraska School Laws provides specifically for the approval of high schools. In connection with the operation of this law this department has frequendy met difficult problems relating to approval for exemption from the county-wide high school tax or for the collecting of free high school tuition for non-resident students. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The quality of academic work being done in the school, the qualifications of the teachers employed, the general status of equipment and instructional materials and the financial ability of the local school district to support a high school program are factors taken into account when making decisions as to approval of these schools. Tht DePartment issues a bulletin entitled, "Rural and Village High Schools," which sets forth the regulations for high school approval. This bulletin outlines a program of studies as a matter of guidance in setting up a school program in keeping with the community's financial ability, and at the same time meeting the requirements of this office. In setting up standards for approved high schools, it has always been the policy of this office to aid the schools to build their high school programs so as to conform as nearly as possible to the standards now being maintained in accredited high schools. It would seem that this is the only reasonable way in which to justify this program. The education of the pupils is of major importance to this office. The provisions of the law relative to high school approval read as follows: 1 "Section 79-902. Free High School Education, Free High School Tui - tion, Tax Levy, Collection, Fund. The county superintendent of each county where a county high school is not maintained shall within thirty (30) days after the annual meeting certify to the county board of supervisors or commissioners the number of qualified pupils as provided in Section 79-901, C. S. Supp., Neb., 1931, whose parents or guardians have applied to the County superintendent for free high school tuition privileges, the amount necessary to pay the high school tuition of said pupils for the ensuing school year at the rate of Two Dollars and twenty-five cents (#2.25) per week or fraction thereof, and a list of school districts which have been approved by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as schools qualified to grant free public high school education to non-resident pupils under the pro - visons of this Act. Upon receipt of said certificate, the said county board shall levy on all taxable property in the said county a sufficient tax to pay said high school tuition, as certified by the county superin - tendent; provided said board shall exclude from said levy all the actual valuation on all of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved four year high school, shall exclude from said levy three-fourths of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved three year high school, shall exclude from said levy one-half of the actual valuation of the tax - able property of any district in which is maintained an approved two year high school and shall exclude from said levy one-fourth of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved one year high school ..." In carrying out the provisions of the above law, this office supplies the county superintendents of the state with proper application blanks in July. These application blanks are forwarded by the county superintendent to the </seg>
            <seg id="p190">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT directors of all those school districts desiring approval of their high school work. Each of these school districts files its application for approval in the office of the county superintendent. This official, after verifying the facts and approving the application, signs the same and forwards it to the Office of the State Superintendent not later than the 20th of September when the high school in its various grades has been actually organized and in full operation. Final approval of schools is not given until the first day of June of each year by the State Department of Public Instruction, at which time county superintendents, county clerks and county treasurers are notified of the ap - proved schools in their respective counties. A school or added grades must be in actual operation before it receives the consideration of this office for approval. Exemption from the tax levy or any part of the high school tax levy depends upon the approval as reported by the State Superintendent for the year just past. This seems to be the most logical course of procedure under the law as it exists in the statute book at the present time. Classes of high schools. For the purposes of approval, public high schools are divided into two classes: (1) Accredited high schools and minor accredited high schools. Refer to report on accredited schools. (2) Approved non-accredited high schools. In addition to those schools accredited to the University of Nebraska, there are a number of smaller schools offering one, two, three, or four years of high school work. The schools that meet the requirements of the State Department of Public Instruc - tion are approved as one year, two year, three year, or four year high schools, and-are eligible to collect free high school tuition for non-resident pupils. Refer to the list of a'pproved non-accredited high schools. This office has sought to keep in as intimate touch with the approved high schools as is possible. It is our desire that all of these schools be visited by representatives of this office to the end that these persons may competently advise as to the best steps to take in providing for educational efficiency and the carrying out of regulations and requirements. This office will seek to advise professionally to the end that the schools may at all times operate under conditions that will insure success. Certain denominatonal schools other than the public schools have been approved by this office for academic purposes only. These schools are not privileged to collect free high school tuition money as paid by the district, county or state. The Constitution of the State of Nebraska, Article VII, Section 11, provides that, "No sectarian instruction shall be allowed in any school or institution supported in whole or in part by the public funds set apart for educational purposes." The following is a list of the approved non-accredited high schools, approved as of July 1, 1936: </seg>

The present year is thus the thirtieth' in which the high schools of the state have been engaged in the task of preparing young people to teach in the rural schools of the state. During the last twenty - three years, for which exact figures are available, 40,174 students have been graduated from the two-year normal training course and during the thirty - year period the figure of 45,000 would be a close approximation. The number of approved normal training high schools and the enroll ment in the normal training courses increased steadily until the year 1924-25 when a peak of 254 schools with an enrollment of 7,016 students was reported. Since then there has been a gradual but steady decline. In June, 1936, there were 199 such schools with an enrollment of 3,566. A significant fact which may help to explain the decrease in the number of approved normal training schools and the enrollment in their courses is the fact that the number of one- and two-room rural schools has been decreasing steadily for some time. The following table shows the decrease in the number of normal training high schools, the enrollment in the normal training courses, and the decrease in the number of teachers employed in the one- and two-room rural schools. </seg>

Until we have conclusive evidence that they are able to supply this demand it would seem necessary to continue the normal training program in the high schools. At the present time there are 6,097 one- and two-room rural schools employing 6,236 teachers. The number of new teachers required each year for these schools is, in normal years, about twenty-five per cent of the total number of teachers employed. Consequendy, abour 1,500 new reac!, - ers are needed each year to fill die vacancies in the rural schools of Nebraska. In June, 1936, the four state teachers colleges issued 268 General Elementary Certificates, and all other colleges issued 136. (Since 1935, Elementary Rural, Professional Rural and Advanced Rural Certificates have been dis - continued.) The General Elementary Certificate does not, of necessity, imply that the holder has had specific training for teaching in the rural field. The other incorporated schools of the state, authorized to issue certificates, also issue each year several General Elementary Certificates. But even if all of these holders of General Elementary Certificates should go into die rural schools, which is not the case, they could by no means fill the vacancies which normally occur each year. Reports received by the Department of Rural Education from 3,325 rural teachers in 59 counties of Nebraska show that of these teachers, 2,349 or 70.6 per cent were graduates of die normal training course in die high schools of the state. Of this 2,349 all but one-fourth had, however, secured further college training. This is as it should be. For one of the greatest recommendations for high school normal training is that it lays </seg>
            <seg id="p197">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION a basis and seemingly furnishes an incentive for further professional prepar - ation. Our state teacher training institutions have not as yet made their departments of rural education sufficiently adequate or attractive to encourage a large number of persons to enter the courses which are intended to prepare them for teaching in the rural schools. In fact, there is a question as to whether it is possible to make them sufficiently attractive at the present time. Students come to the teachers colleges with die idea of being trained for urban positions and it is only natural that the colleges shoula provide the courses which die students demand. Something, no doubt, could be done to overcome this tendency, but diere is a question as to just how much, as long as the salaries and working conditions remain as they now are in many rural schools. As a part of die National Survey of The Education of Teachers, Pro - fessor Mabel Carney of Teachers College, Columbia University, prepared a report on The Preparation of Teachers for Small Rural Schools, which was published in 1935. Professor Carney analyzed the curricula of the institu - tions co-operating in die survey and found diat "rural curricula" of various lengdis were reported as offered in 17 per cent of die universities, 18 pa - cent of the colleges, 50 per cent of die junior colleges, and in die large majority of normal schools and teachers colleges. Data obtained from other sections of die survey would indicate diat many of diese so-called "rural curricula" were merely suggested patterns of courses with two or diree special courses in rural education. In die special inquiry conducted by Professor Carney in 1932-33 she found that 124 of the 179 institutions replying gave a course in rural sociology or rural life and diat 93 institutions gave a course in nature study designed for rural teachers. These were the only two courses given in more than half of theV institutions. Rural school teaching, organization, and management was given in only 73 of the 179 institutions. It was shown that not all of the normal schools and teachers' colleges included in die study provided rural school practice and not all of those who did provided enough for all of the students who should have had it. It would seem that die situation throughout the United States in regard to die training of rural teachers by normal schools and teachers colleges is much the same as it is in Nebraska. Of the four teachers colleges in Nebraska only dii Teachers College at Kearney operates a rural school which gives an opportunity for practice teaching to students preparing for rural positions. All of them offer some observation work in rural schools. In our high school normal training courses, however, three days of practice teaching and two or diree days or observation are an absolute requirement. A most troublesome problem is presented by the considerable number of teachers who prepare for work in a city school system and are compelled </seg>
            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT to serve a probationary, experience-getting, period in the rural schools. If a teacher is intending to be a kindergarten and primary teacher in a city system but may have to teach one or two years in a rural school, the time used to prepare for the rural work is time taken from preparation for kindergarten-primary work, and yet failure to make any preparation for the rural work means an unjustifiable imposition of professional incompetence upon, the rural community. Professor Carney suggested a minimum program to prepare for rural school work and not decrease the adequacy of the teacher's preparation in his chosen field. This program could be taken during a six week's summer session or during a term preceding graduation and should include units for orientation in rural life, rural school organization and control, some special techniques peculiar to the rural schools, some observations of well-taught rural schools and, if possible, some actual prac - tice in a rural school. The State Department of Public Instruction would be glad to see the 5tate teachers colleges provide some such program as the one outlined by Professor Carney. In fact, we approve of any and all attempts by our higher institutions of learning to provide a more adequate program of rural teacher training. Our rural pupils have a right to be instructed by teachers who understand rural conditions and appreciate the contribution which rural life is making to our civilization. Our rural schools, because of their isolation, need more social and instructional leadership from their teachers than do the schools in urban communities. The conclusions of this department in regard to the teacher training program in our high schools are, briefly, as follows: First, there is no other program of teacher training in Nebraska that gives as much emphasis to the needs of the rural schools as does the high school normal training program. Well organized courses of study have been prepared and are in the hands of all the normal training instructors at the present time. Plans and teaching procedures are especial lv designed to show the students how to organize subject matter and present it in the rural schools. The normal training instructors have had actual teaching experience in the rural schools. During the two-year course the normal training students review thoroughly the common branches in order that they may have their subject matter well in hand, and they are required to do observation and practice teaching, under supervision, in the rural schools. All these students are required to pass the state examinations in the seventeen subjects. No other teacher training program in Nebraska at the present time gives a com - parable training for rural teachers. Second, that the number of normal training schools and the enrollment in their courses tend to adapt themselves to the demand for rural teachers, so that there is not an ever increasing flood of applicants for rural schools. Third, that the high school normal training classes have been and are still furnishing a large percentage of the teachers in our rural schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Fourth, that there will continue to be a demand for high school normal training courses as long as the young people desire the training and as long as a good proportion of those graduating are able to secure employment in the rural schools. Of the class graduated last spring almost half are teaching this fall. Fifth, that the program itself has been improved materially by the introduction of a course in rural sociology and rural economics as a required course. Sixth, that the drought conditions which have prevailed in Nebraska for the last three years do not warrant the abandonment of the normal training program at the present time. Our rural citizens cannot afford to send their sons and daughters far away from home to receive a more extensive training at this time. Seventh, the reports in our office show that about four-fifths of the normal training graduates are continuing to improve themselves by taking courses in summer schools and regular sessions of the university and teachers colleges. It is the belief that the time devoted to the major reviews should be increased from twelve to eighteen weeks. This will be done as affecting the junior normal training class of 1937-38. We feel that this will materially strengthen these basic subjects and provide a better ground work in these subjects for our normal training students. The State Department of Public Instruction is proud of the cxcellen: work being done in the high school normal training classes. Our normal training supervisors are an exceptionally fine group of teachers, in sympathy with the problems of the rural areas and earnest in their attempts to provide tV kind of training which will best meet those problems. The young people who enroll for the normal training courses are usually the finest type of student in the high school, and the training they receive tends to make them even more responsible and conscientious. It has been the testimony of many superintendents and principals that the normal training program has a very wholesome influence upon the morale of the whole high school. This office pledges its wholehearted support to the improvement of the normal training program as long as there continues to be a demand for it. </seg>

Holdrege ': I '. - Omaha Kathleen Stack : ■■ ■ Grand Island Arta Lewis : : ; ■ : • -. Hastings INTRODUCTION The law setting up the Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses in the State Department of Public Instruction became effective November 1, 1935. In view of the recent establishment of this service, it seems best to include in this report liberal provisions of die law in explan - ation of this vital service to the people of the State, which is composed of the Division of Registration for Nurses and the Division of Education for Nurses. Purpose of the law— Senate File No. 127. "A BILL FOR AN ACT relating to public health, con - venience, welfare, nursing education, registration, licensing and re-registration; to authorize and regulate the practice of nursing in the state of Nebraska; to authorize and provide for accredit - ing schools of nursing; to provide for a system of inspection thereof; to audiorize and provide for the examination, licensing and registration of nurses and to create a Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses; to fix the powers and duties of said bureau and to establish fees for examination, registra - tion and re-registration of nurses; to provide for the protection and disposal of the fund arising from said fees; to provide for the selection and compensation of the members and em - ployees of said bureau; to limit the expenditures of said bureau; to provide penalties for the violation of this Act." </seg>
            <seg id="p201">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Establishment and Organization—Senate File 127. Section 1. "There is hereby created a Bureau of Education and Regis - tration for Nurses which shall be composed of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, ex-officio, and four mem - bers to be appointed as hereinafter provided." The State Superintendent of Public Instruction, as ex-officio president of the bureau, is empowered to appoint a State Director of the Bureau who is a nurse, licensed to practice in Nebraska, and who has been actively identified with educational work in the profession for at least five years. This appointment must be approved by the Governor. The Director serves as secretary to the bureau and to each division thereof, and she directs the work of the bureau and performs all duties customarily incident to the office and such others as are required by law. Powers of The Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses —Section 7. 71-1504. "The bureau shall adopt and promulgate such rules and regu - lations, not inconsistent with law, as it may deem necessary to properly cany out the provisions of this act and to effectuate its purpose; shall adopt a seal; shall establish a system of inspection of schools of nursing in Nebraska; shall register as accredited such schools as shall meet the requirements of law and the rules and regulations of the bureau as to courses, standards and management; shall license and register such applicants as are recommended by the Division of Registration as entitled to be licensed under the provisions of this act; shall hold hearings upon all charges calling for the suspension or revocation of a license issued hereunder and upon all matters relating to any duties imposed upon it by law; shall cause the prosecution of all persons violating the provisions of this act; shall make an annual report of its proceedings and expenditures to the Governor on or before December thirty-first of each year, and shall perform generally such other duties as may devolve upon it by law." The Division of Registration for Nurses is composed of three nurses who are appointed (one annually) by the Governor of Nebraska, for a period of three years, each of whom shall have been actively engaged in nursing under license in this state for a period of three years. No more than one member shall be appointed from one congressional district and each shall have been a bona fide resident of that congressional district for a period of at least three years previous to the time of such appointment. Functions of the Division of Registration—Senate File 127, Section 5: "The Division of Registration for Nurses shall meet at the office of the bureau at the State Capitol building not to exceed </seg>
            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT six times a year, the dates to be determined by said division, for the purpose of preparing for examinations for nurses and of certifying grades to the bureau, and for the transaction of such other business as it shall consider proper in carrying out the work of the division. Such examinations shall be held at such times and places as it may determine. It shall publish notice of the time and place of holding examinations in at least one journal devoted to the interests of professional nursing at least thirty days prior to the date of any such meeting and shall also mail written notice thereof to every applicant for license and to all accredited schools of nursing in this state, thirty days prior thereto." The Division of Education is composed of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Director of Nursing Education and one member of the Division of Registration to be selected by such division. Provision is made whereby the State Superintendent may appoint as mem - bers of the Division of Education, a member of the Nebraska State Nurses Association and a member of the Nebraska League of Nursing Education from two names submitted by each organization respectively. Their tenure of office is the same as that of the Director of Nursing Education who is appointed to serve under the same tenure of office for which the State Superintendent making such appointment has been elected. Function* of the Division of Education—Senate File 127, Sec - tion 6: "The Division of Education for Nurses shall inspect all schools of nursing; shall advise with and make recommenda - tions to the heads thereof as to courses and methods of instruc - tion, training and standards; and shall perform such other duties as may be implied or necessarily incident to the effectu - ation of the provisions of this act." The first year of the existence of the Bureau of Education and Regis - tration for Nurses closed on November 1, 1936. It has been a satisfying, happy year even though organizing the work, equipping the office, and establishing routine duties to carry out the provisions of this law have been arduous. This service gives to the nurses of Nebraska opportunities and advantages such as are provided for nurses in other states under similar laws. Some of the improvements are: All matters pertaining to education and registration of nurses are now centralized in one office and not spread out into two offices under different persons entirely. No licenses are issued to nurses which have not been approved by well qualified nurses appointed for that purpose. </seg>
            <seg id="p203">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.. Reciprocity has been established with more states, which leads to more opportunities for employment of Nebraska nurses in other states. Better qualified nurses may now be appointed as examiners of nurses and to pass upon credentials of those who apply for licenses. "New-type" examination questions are now permitted to be used in state examinations for nurses. Educational requirements for admission to schools of nursing have been raised legally, which has been helpful in securing reciprocity with more states. Nurses have greater control of all fees paid by nurses. Space in the Nebraska Education Bulletin is allotted for articles on education for nurses and requirements for admission to schools of nursing, etc., for notices of examinations and for information per - taining to registration of nurses and many other details. Nursing education has been placed under a state system of edu - cation such as is provided for other professions as medicine, teaching, dentistry, pharmacy, etc. All of these indications of progress, and others too numerous to mention, have raised the standards in Nebraska on a level with those of other states, thus broadening the opportunities for service for the registered nurses of Nebraska. Funds for Maintenance. The Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses is self-sustaining, no money being appropriated from general state taxes for its maintenance. Funds for carrying on its activities are derived from fees collected from the profession concerned, which are "to be credited to a fund which is hereby created for the sole use of said bureau." (Section 8, Senate File 127.) No other state funds are provided or can be used according to Section 9, Senate File 127: "Provided, that the amounts to be paid for expenses incident to the operation of said bureau and compensation to die members of die Division of Registration and the State Director of Nursing Education shall not exceed the total amount of money credited to said fund." It is hoped that a reserve fund may be accumulated so that more institutes and educational programs may be made available for the registered nurses of Nebraska such as are enjoyed by trie nurses in other states. Changes in nursing go along with new discoveries and changes in die care of die sick and injured and in new methods for die prevention of disease and epidemics. In the interests of the public, opportunities should be provided for Nebraska </seg>

LICENSURE AND REGISTRATION OF NURSES No one may practice as or assume to be a graduate, registered nurse in Nebraska without being licensed in Nebraska according to Senate Fil- 12", Section 14, 71-1501: "For the purpose of this act, any person shall be deemed to •* engaged in die practice of nursing who practices nursing as a graduate or registered nurse or publicly professes to be a graduate or registered nurse and assumes the duties incident thereto." Licensure or registration in one or more other states does not consti - tute licensure or registration in Nebraska. Licenses are issued by exami - nation or through reciprocity with other states. Every nurse who applies for a license must present satisfactory evidence, on forms supplied by the bureau, that she is a citizen of the United States, a graduate of a high school which offers a course of four years and that she has graduated from an accredited school of nursing. She must have passed satisfactorily the state examinations in all subjects as prescribed by law and have paid the required fee of ten dollars prior to taking such examinations. Licenses are issued through reciprocity provided that applicants' cre - dentials show they meet the requirements established in Nebraska, that such credentials are approved by the Division of Registration, and that the fee of fifteen dollars, for licensure through reciprocity, is paid. A clause in our law permits consideration of applications for reciprocal registration on an individual basis rather than according to requirements established in various state laws. However, the standards in Nebraska must be complied with in full. New forms for nurses (licensed in other states) to use in applying for licenses here have been prepared, which greatly reduce the delay in securing the necessary credentials from other states. This is an advantage to many nurses. All nurses, who are employed in a hospital which maintains a school of nursing, must be licensed in Nebraska. Licences Issued by the Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses From November 1, 1935 to November 1, 1936 Licenses issued by reciprocity ;. 43 Licenses issued by examination ' 263 Total number nurses licensed (now) for active service 2,447 Total number nurses assigned to non-practice list 1,418 (Over 170 nurses, who are licensed in Nebraska, have left the state during the year.) </seg>
            <seg id="p205">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Non-practice List The Nebraska Law provides for a nurse to be assigned to the non - practice list should she desire to retire temporarily from active practice, and, while so assigned, she must cease to engage in practice as a registered nurse or be subject to the penalties provided under the law, one of which is revo - cation of her license. A nurse whose license has been revoked has no license and in order to obtain one will be required to take die state examinations in order to be reinstated in good standing for active practice. This is according to an interpretation of the law received from the office of the a ttorney-general. Annual Licemure or Re-registration. All licenses, or registration for the practice of nursing expire on January first of each year. Each licensee is notified accordingly at least thirty days before the expiration of her license to give her an opportunity to renew the same through payment of the annual renewal fee of two dollars. However, she is responsible for becoming re-registered each year and may pay the fee voluntarily before January first without having received such notice. Many nurses fail to notify this office of changes in address; therefore, our notices may not reach them. Annual re-registration is now carried on in nearly all of the states. Under our new law, all matters pertaining to the registration of nurses are now under die supervision of nurses, the same as in odier progressive states. In systematizing this work, we have received invaluable assistance from Mr. W. A. Rosene, Director of the Division of Certification of Teachers. State Examinations State Examinations for nurses are held three times each year to give those who desire to become licensed by examination an opportunity to do so. All applicants to take die examination must show evidence diat they meet the requirements of Nebraska as to preparation, citizenship, age, etc. Examinations are now being given in ten subjects which are specified under our law. Nebraska was one of seven states in the union which did not use the "New" or "Objective Type" of examination questions in nurses' examinations. Since the establishment of the Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses, we have been permitted to introduce the "new type" questions. They have been gladly welcomed by die examinees because diey reduce the great amount of arduous writing involved in the use of the old essay type of questions, and, because they cover a much wider field of subject-matter, they prove to be a more equitable test for all concerned. Psychologists tell us the amount of guess-work is markedly reduced in using the "objective" questions. The types we are employing are: 1. True-False. 2. Comple- </seg>
            <seg id="p206">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT rion. 3. Matching. 4. Single Choice. 5. Plural Choice. 6. Analogy. Inasmuch as the value of the "True-False" type is being questioned, we are about to reduce the number used or to eliminate them entirely and substitute others of greater value. At least 200 questions or items are used in each subject given under the "new" or "objective" type of questioning. The "essay" type of questions are still used in six subjects: Subjects in which essay Subjects in which "new" or type is used: "objective" type is used: 1. Dietetics 1. Anatomy and Physiology 2. Ethics and History of Nursing 2. Materia Medica 3. Medical Nursing 3. Obstetrical Nursing 4. Surgical Nursing 4. Pediatrics and Communicable 5. Psychiatric Nursing (Nervous Diseases ' and Mental) 6. Bacteriology, Hygiene and Urin - alysis Chemistry is now being added to the list in several .states, but we have not attempted to do so in this state. What effect this may have on recipro - city witli other states for our licensed nurses is not definitely known. A total number of 310 nurses took the state examinations from Novem - ber 1, 1935 to November 1, 1936: February ... 111 new applicants 8 repeaters (failed in carler examination) June 25 new applicants 13 repeaters October 147 new applicants 6 repeaters Most of the failures occur in the subjects in the order in which they arc stated: Anatomy and Physiology, Materia Medica. Psychiatry (Nervous and Mental) and Ethics and History of Nursing. Marked improvement has been made in the formulation of examination questions inasmuch as better prepared nurses are permitted to prepare the examination questions and conduct the examinations. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SCHOOLS OF NURSING Accredited School* of Nursing. At present there are fourteen accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska: Omaha: Bishop Clarkson Memorial Hospital School of Nursing, Creighton Memorial St. Joseph's Hospital School of Nursing, </seg>
            <seg id="p207">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Evangelical Covenant Hospital School of Nursing, Immanuel Hospital School of Nursing. Nebraska Methodist Episcopal Hospital School of Nursing, St. Catherine's Hospital School of Nursing, University of Nebraska Hospital School of Nursing. Lincoln: Bryan Memorial Hospital School of Nursing, Lincoln General Hospital School of Nursing, St. Elizabeth Hospital School of Nursing. Grand Island: St. Francis Hospital School of Nursing. Hastings: Mary Lanning Memorial Hospital School of Nursing, Scottsbluff: West Nebraska Methodist Episcopal Hospital School of Nursing. Alliance: St. Joseph's Hospital School of Nursing. Number of Students in Nebraska Schools of Nursing on November 1, First year students _..349 Second year students _ 209 Third year students _....249 : " Total number 807 (These figures do not include those who complete the course this fall.) Eight schools admit only one class of students each year, and the rest admit two classes annually. Before or upon admission, each applicant must submit high school credentials to die Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses inasmuch as the legal requirement is graduation from a high school which offers a course of four years. Upon approval of such creden - tials, student-nurse certificates are issued for each applicant to each school. During the year (November 1, 1935 to November 1, 1936) 379 student - nurse certificates were granted. Admission Requirements. While the legal admission requirement in Nebraska is a high school course of four years, yet, nearly all of our schools will accept graduates from accredited high schools only. Five schools of nursing will admit only those who meet college entrance requirements, others will admit only those who rank in the upper half or third in the high school class, and two schools of nursing require a general average of 85 in high school work. Preference is being given to young women who have had college preparation in certain prescribed </seg>
            <seg id="p208">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT subjects, but we have no place for the poor college student with low grades and who shows low mental capacity. One or two years of college preparation in prescribed courses (for which time credit is allowed), is advantageou&lt;&gt; to every young candidate for nursing; and it also extends the age to 19 or 20 years, which is far more desirable than 18 years which our Nebraska law permits, but which is too young. In all of our progressive schools of nursing, mental or intelligence tests are given to students on or shortly after admission, and various aptitude tests and achievement tests are gradually being introduced. No longer should high schools dispose of poor students of low mental ability by sending them to a school of nursing as no such school, worthy of the name, can afford to admit them, and it is devastating experience for a young woman to be dis - missed from some field of endeavor for which she is totally unfit and to which she should never have been directed. Nursing needs women of sound personality and character, who are teachable ilnd show promise of growth and ability to profit through education on a truly professional level. Accreditment of Schools of Nuraing. The law provides for annual inspection and accreditment of schools which meet tiie requirements established under Senate File 127, Section 12. 71-1503: "An accredited trainng school within the meaning of this act shall be further defined as: 1. A school primarily or by affiliation con - nected with a general hospital, having a daily average of not less . than fifty patients, teaching theory and practice of nursing as pro - vided by the current curriculum of the National League of Nursing Education and which gives a systematic three year course of training covering die subjects referred to in the preceding section. 2. A training school which regularly publishes a catalogue giving the re - quirements for graduation." Each school of nursing is visited at least once annually, and more often when necessary, by the Director of Nursing Education. A report with recommendations is made on the findings, which is submitted to the Bureau and used as a basis for accreditment, depending upon whether the school meets all requirements. A copy of each report is sent by the president of the Bureau to each superintendent of a hospital which maintains a school of nursing, and a copy is sent also to the director of each school. A few schools meet minimum requirements only. Other schools maintain standards far above those required legally and are constantly striving for further improve - ment which augers well for the future of these institutions. Six of diese schools have introduced courses on.a college level of teaching which yield college credit for die same in psychology, sociology, chemistry, bacteriology, etc. The mediocre schools of nursing face severe competition in diese bet - ter schools, as young women today, under vocational guidance in educational institutions, carefully investigate die schools of nursing before making a se- </seg>
            <seg id="p209">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION lection We quote from Dr. Richard Olding Beard (now deceased) who formerly held a professorship on the faculty of the University of Minnesota: ihat there are schools which lie beyond the educational pale, are insus - ceptible of reform, and are doomed to ultimate discontinuance is squarely true. These schools are a millstone about the neck of the nursing profession. Let us exercise toward them the candor of disapproval their hopelessness deserves for their extinction will be the best thing for the schools, the best thing for educational progress, the best thing for the profession, the big ubHc" thC h°Spitals ' and mdubitably the best thing for the Some Conditions which are studied in Our Schools of Nursing: Clinical facilities are being improved gradually in that more clinical services are being segregated in our hospitals and more medical patients are being admitted to provide a better balanced experience for student nurses which is at present preponderandy surgical. It is gratifying to note that nve schools of nursing are maintaining affiliations in Public Health Nursing which provide splendid experience in nursing under home conditions. How - ever such experience must be gained under well prepared supervisors in Public Health Nursing. Six schools of nursing maintain affiliations in one or more clinical services in some other hospital, while four schools have no affiliation whatsoever m practical experience under educational supervision. Affiliations in nursing practice under institutions which are approved, gready enhance the standing of schools of nursing and they are needed by every school in the state. ' Teaching equipment is being improved gradually, especially in the mat - ter of demonstration rooms for teaching nursing practice. Improvement has also been made in that more equipment has been provided on the various services of the hospitals which should make it possible for the students to carry out their classroom teaching in nursing in their care of patients as - signed to them. It should also make for safer technic in caring for patients Greatly needed, are better stocked professional libraries with books helpful to nurses and not too many obsolete books discarded from other libraries. More reference books are needed for courses in which each student does not have a textbook. Hours on duty in the hospital are being gradually decreased; however, much improvement is still needed in this direction. An eight-hour day in hospital service, plus class periods, plus study hours, leaves litde or no time for the necessary rest and recreation required for the well-being of every nor - mal individual. A state of continuous fatigue undermines the health of students, and their resistance to disease is lowered, which may account for the heavy illness record noted at intervals. Two schools have established a forty-eight-hour week which includes class periods as well as ward experience. </seg>
            <seg id="p210">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Health examinations are given now routinely in all schools of nursing to all students on admission and each year thereafter while in the school. Preventive measures are taken against smallpox and typhoid fever for all students; and, in many schools, also against diphtheria and scarlet fever. Meals for students are planned and prepared under the direction of well prepared dietitians in all but four schools. Faculties of Schools of Nursing. There' have been changes in the position of the director of school of nursing in three institutions in the interval from November 1, 1935 to No - vember 1, 1936. Of the directors or superintendents now in the schools, seven have either a baccalaureate or Master of Arts degree, and six have had some college preparation. All are high school graduates who have had some advanced work in supervision or education of nurses. All of our schools have at least one full-time instructor. All such instructors have had some college preparation and several have college degrees. Better prepared supervisors (head nurses) are needed in all of our schools of nursing. Since nursing education is beyond the level of high school education, therefore qualifications for nurses on the faculty of a school of nursing should also be on a higher level than is found ordinarily. Under Bulletin A-II Problems of Curriculum Administration (Curriculum Committee National League Nursing Education) we find: "Faculty Qualifications —There is no question that the higher level of instruction presupposed, as well as the type of instruction recommended in the different courses, and the demand for more specialized information, call for better qualified personnel than is usually found in schools of nursing. This applies to the entire group of directors and supervisors, as well as those who are primarily employed for teaching." Since emphasis is being placed on "the modern socialized func - tion of the nurse as one who nurses the sick, prevents sickness and teaches all with whom she comes in contact such hygienic measure; as will lead to the promotion of health," —it is highly essential that nurses on the faculty be imbued with these ideas or they will not be successfully inculcated in the minds of student nurses. Poorly or meagerly prepared faculty members, with a narrow background, usually do not have a broad point of view as to the needs of students. Curriculum. The curriculum prepared by die National League of Nursing Education is used. However, our more progressive schools of nursing have far exceeded the bounds of this curriculum in the teaching of several subjects. Six schools have established college connections with different universities or colleges in Nebraska. A new curriculum is now being prepared under the auspices of the National League of Nursing Education, and nurses, active in nursing educa- </seg>
            <seg id="p211">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION tion in Nebraska, have been collaborating with the League in this work. Much of the subject matter or content will be the same as under the curricu - lum now in use, except that it will be brought up to date according to new scientific discoveries and newer methods of preventing disease and caring for the sick and injured. However, the grouping of subjects will be changed and emphasis will be placed on closer integration of theory and practice. The aim which permeates the whole curriculum is that of adjustment of the nurse to the multitude of situations in which she is called to serve: "Any professional curriculum must take into consideration the services which the profession is expected to give to the public at large, and the common or basic needs of the students who are likely to practice in any part of the coun - try and in many different types of professional service. Obviously, the basic professional program in nursing should not be planned in terms of hos - pital needs and hospital nursing, nor in terms of the local situation only, but in terms of the nursing needs of the public, so far as they can be ascer - tained and predicted." This curriculum is the foundation course upon which all specialized courses are built; therefore, it must serve nurses who may later prepare for supervision or teaching in schools for nurses or enter some phase of public health nursing such as: visiting nursing, school nursing, county or rural nursing, etc. Nurses also specialize according to clinical fields such as: obstetrical nursing, pediatric nursing, tuberculosis nursing, etc. The missionary field is also calling for well prepared nurses. The basic course in nursing is fundamental to all specialized work. In short the purpose of the new curriculum is "To help prepare nurses to nurse; but, we want to interpret nursing broadly and to consider how nurses can meet the needs of society to-day." The content or subject-matter of the curriculum is grouped under four main divisions: 1. "The main strand is devoted to die nursing arts which include nursing theory and practice in the various clinical fields as well as nutrition and hygiene. 2. "Another strand starts with the biological and physical sciences— anatomy, physiology, microbiology, and chemistry. These are continued in the introduction to medical science, materia medica, and die medical aspects of the clinical subjects. 3. "This grouping includes the social sciences—psychology, sociology, history of nursing, ethics, and related social and professional problems." These courses are to be closely woven into the central core of the curriculum, the nursing arts, and not be taught as isolated subjects. 4. "An additional group of subjects" is not a part of the curriculum proper but it is an important part of die broader educational program of the school of nursing. It is devoted to extra-curricular or extra-professional ac - tivities—recreational, social, and cultural." </seg>
            <seg id="p212">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The clinical program for student nurses includes: 1. "Organized instruction dealing with the nature of the various di - seases or conditions, their treatment, prevention, and nursing care." 2. "Qinical experience during which die student nurses observe, study and care for patients in hospital wards and clinics." The situations in ward experience should be carefully selected in terms of their educational value to student nurses. They should be "graduated in difficulty and complexity to provide for the progressive growth of the student," and to help her to analyze and adjust to the needs of each situation and not have to rely merely on a few isolated skills and technics, haphazardly performed. Conclusion. To place nursing education on a truly professional level which is so ne - cessary to safeguard the interests of the public in health matters, undoubtedly the need of professionally well prepared nurses on the faculties of our schools of nursing is the most urgent need to-day. Only nurses who realize the social significance of their work, its preventive and teaching aspects as well as alleviative and curative, should hold positions on the faculty of a school of nursing. They should have had also some preparation in the principles and methods of teaching. Transition from the old to the new or revised curriculum will be made easier through such a faculty. Dr. Richard Olding Beard, with penetrating insight into community health needs, said in one of his eloquent and inspiring addresses: "I wish I might impress you women whose graduation from school is not so far away, but whose initial years of practice are rapidly passing over your heads, with these two tilings: First, that you are the torchbearers of the knowledge and the funded wisdom of other days committed to your care—not to hoard, but to use and to multiply; then second, that it is yours to hand on these treasures to those who are to follow you—the graduates of to-morrow —who. if they worthily fulfull their highest destiny, are to climb to higher heights than you have held. Herein lies the true link which binds nursing practice to nursing education—that together they make for a continuing process of development, an educational sequence. And so it is that the highest hall - mark of a profession is its instinct of professional parentage; its concern for those who are to follow in its footsteps, its desire that they shall be better in body, keener of understanding, loftier of soul. Cherish, then, these young sisters of your calling; contribute to their gain of a higher education than you have had; start them out at a point nearer to their goal than you have been able to get; rejoice with them in their larger opportunities; and teach them of the lineage of an honorable profession whose history and heritage it is theirs to guard." </seg>

            <seg id="p215">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION New Course of Study Special emphasis has been placed on character training throughout the new Course of Study for Elementary Schools of Nebraska. We have also included a special unit on character education with suggestions as required by the foregoing enactment. Character training becomes an integral part of all training and we believe that it should not be isolated as a separate course of the curriculum. If it is true that "we learn to do by doing," and that " 'doing with' makes influence contacts possible" (page 371, Elementary Course of Study), we would do well to organize our plans that we may direct well chosen activities so that character may be a "by-product of other experiences." The traditional "three R's" are supplemented by the "three C's." Citizenship, conduct, and character are being effectively integrated into our educational planning with an increased emphasis. "Character training has a two-fold aspect: (a) Prevention—helping the child to learn to make adjustments to his daily life situations. (b) Cure—helping the child to overcome certain maladjustments or bad habits by supplementing them with good habits." 1 "Activity" as used in the Elementary Course of Study has a broad meaning. It includes more than physical action. Good taste expresses itseli wv aestketk tKou^ttts, vjotds, and {eelm^s, as vjell. as vcv activities. "7/i general, activities may in dude not only physical actions but intelligent decisions, n\ota\ conduct, teYigious observation, and emotiona\ attitudes and feelings as well as sfa'//s ancf habits of various kinds. All these are forms of activities and they may all be used upon occasion as a media through which traits and ideals are expressed." 2 Teachers should have definite plans for developing desirable character traits. Children should be taught to distinguish between right and wrong, and should be helped to form desirable habits. "Both activities and traits need to be selected. The desire for the ideals must be aroused, trie standards must be set and adhered to, and instructions about how to acquire the ideals must be specific and concrete. It is not sufficient to issue the com - mands, 'Be Courteous,' etc. The child must be shown how to be neat, accur - ate, courteous, or honest in each unit of instruction where the trait applies." 3 Organized Activities The special unit on Character Education in the new Elementary Course of Study gives complete outlines for school clubs. Many excellent activities are suggested. The school club plan provides for individual conferences as lGermano ami Gennnne, Chnrncter FMiii-utlnn. SCbnrtiTs, Tin- Teaching &lt;&gt;f Iilcnlx. niiiM </seg>
            <seg id="p216">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT well as for group cooperation. The child is given many chances to make choices and to feel responsibility to himself and to his group of these choices. "The ideal is to help him to reach the plan where he will desire the good and secure as much satisfaction practicing it as he obtained previously in doing die wrong."* The club program provides for activities by club members. Teachers direct club members in plannnig activities which tend to develop desirable traits and place special emphasis as required for these courses. The activities are planned so that they function for better school discipline and for home cooperation. Committees assume responsibility for leadership which results in a better attitude toward school. The school becomes the social center and students accept responsibility as citizens of a democracy. In die club plan the strong incentive to do right is the approval of the social gallery, which through the club, includes the school, the home, and die community. "Group approval and disapproval are among the most important determinates of conduct. In primitive societies, social control is largely exercised dirough group opinion. In a modern democracy great issues can be forced aright by adequate public opinion." 5 "The period under consideration is one in which boys and girls have an astonishing avidity for badges, club buttons, etc. Boys' and girls' garden clubs, pig dubs, health clubs, and the multitude of other child organizations spring into being at the slightest opportunity. Wise is the teacher who uses this splendid resource in furthering her legitimate school plans, and better will be die citizenship diat eventuates from boys' and girls' clubs which have been wisely led. Here is die seed bed of true democracy. Here altruism has its roots, or here anarchy may germinate, according as the gregarious tendency is fostered or perverted." 6 The National Child Welfare Association recognized these natural in - terests when plans were formulated for Knighthood of Youth Clubs. Badges have been planned to motivate interest in club activities. The National Child Welfare Association is a non-commercial organization and supplies badges and other material for school clubs at cost. The school club is organized as a regular part of the school program. The club elects its officers and appoints committees as determined by the needs of die local group. The teacher is recognized as the leader and, as such, supervises die dub. Teachers help pupils to discover activities which will aid in forming desirable habits and which will be most helpful to the school. The Club Guide suggests actvities for school, home and community. Many schools use the Knighthood of Youth plan for motivating interest. "It is very probable that the game of Knighthood gives the children delight 4Ibld rAVylunil. Scouting in the Schools. (lOreBB.

            <seg id="p217">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION simply because of its fun for the imagination, its display in pageants, its activities, and its opportunities to do certain tasks in school. These motivate continued interest. However, a certain amount of appreciation of die joy of good conduct comes to die members as diey find teacher and class approval a natural delight, and as good habits remove the embarrassment of public reprovals and bring satisfaction in approvals. "But added to these rewards are die many buttons and new tides given to the children as they advance in rank. This age, which likes to decorate itself with buttons, to assume new names, and to be given self-importance, finds die delights in die paraphernalia of the Knighdipod of Youth very tempting and a great motivation to continued membership. Children are responsive. to the stories of King Arthur and his knights. They love to wear buttons and have shields emblazoned widi rank or tide—to be able to show progress as did the knights of old and wear proudly new evidence of their progress. All such joys will surely motivate a group of children. "The least desirable motivation is that which leads pupils to do socially desirable acts entirely for die sake of reward. It is recommended in the Knighthood of Youdi program diat die appeal be made to die highest motive to which the pupils will at first respond, and diat the teacher there - after try to lead her pupils to react to die highest type of motivation." 7 Teachers have devised many ingenious ways of motivating interest in activities that will, aid in forming desirable habits. The plan in itself is unimportant. That which will be of interest to one group may not interest another group. Plans are flexible and adaptable. Teachers are urged to consider the needs and interests of their group and to mske their plans for the best interests of the group. Group Participation "Opportunities for leadership that are not equalled elsewhere, present themselves in student organizations. Boys and girls can be made dependable and more sensitive to moral values by giving definite time and attention to the building of character." 8 "Modern teaching is characterized by its emphasis upon pupil partici - pation. This is indeed a fortunate condition for the teacher who wishes to give increased attention to the training of character, for the older conventional methods are not suitable. Indeed in the past objections were made to any - thing but the teaching of ideals, because the method was abstract and formal. It did not enlist the active participation of the pupils." 9 The plans for the school club may be adapted to groups of any size. We have found large groups in rural and city schools working together 71Vmlry and Hartshorn* 1. Organization for Youth. SFlsbbnrk, Character Building for Junior High School. Olbld. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT effectively and happily. We have found schools with only three or four pupils carrying on a very well-organized program of activities. Through the school dub the teacher may direct a well-organized group with satisfaction to their interests and with a noticeable saving of time to the group. Much more may be accomplished by the same group in the same length of time. Individual Activities "The child must do the choosing. He must feel satisfaction when he chooses the right, annoyance when he chooses the wrong. In brief, there will be true moral growth in that degree that the child has opportunity -:o make right decisions and to practice with satisfaction those virtues which make for stability of character." 10 By the school club plan, opportunity is given for individual conferences. Encouragement and consultation are given when needed. The individual child is urged to improve his own record of achievement. "We must work through the individual, not to shape him, but per - chance to influence his shaping of himself! "We, and all other experiences from the outside, may influence him— but only as, and in the way in which he rates, and adjudges, and values our part. "This conception of working through the person to be influenced is more deeply revolutionary than one realizes at first. The emphasis for centuries has been on curriculum, on method, on teaching—the spotlight of science today reveals the learner as the important factor! The processes of teaching may well be polished, but the processes of learning are yet more vital. What is in the mind of the learner? "In character learning, as in all learning, we must work through the individual's own activity and through his processes and through his scale of values." 11 The following statement in regard to Knighthood of Youth clubs has been quoted from a reprint from the Los Angeles School Journal: "The Nebraska schools have adopted this plan in their state-wide program. If all schools were to adopt a definite plan for character education, the results would be more evident than when they work toward vague ideals and distant goals. If more is spent for character education, less will be needed for re - forms and broken lives."

Much is still to be accomplished and die task will never be finished. Growing boys and girls demand constant attention to their best interests nnd to their changing needs. Citizenship Clubs in Rural Schools Definite reports have been made of 3,692 school clubs in rural schools of Nebraska. We have not been able to obtain complete statistics from all counties. The number of clubs has steadily increased as instructors have appreciated their practical value in citizenship training. Mr. Jesse J. Correll, County Superintendent of Lancaster County Schools, has this to say of Knighthood of Youth in Lancaster County: "Approximately six years ago the program of Knighthood of Youth, as a character building agency in the schools, was presented to the teachers in Lancaster County. A small group of teachers organized groups in their schools for the remainder of the term. The following year a greater per - centage of teachers organized groups, and since that time approximately one hundred schools have had Knighthood of Youth clubs each year. "Knighthood of Youth in Lancaster County has- been successful be - cause teachers have been interested in the program; because parents have supported it; and because pupils have found an opportunity to live at school, as well as at home. Living and Doing are essential to successful citizenship. Knighthood of Youdi carries out such a program." The rural schools of Gage County have an Annual All-County Student Citizenship Meeting which does much to stimulate interest in their dub activities. Quoting from the Beatrice Sun, March 22, 1936: "Citizenship Club Gathering Success. A membership of 2,195 boys and girls in the County's Knighthood of Youth, 4-H, and Junior Red Cross Clubs was announced yesterday at the rural school citizenship club convention at the senior high school. Attendance was 250. "There are 81 Knighthood of Youth Clubs with 1,119 members; 72 4-H Clubs with 943 members; and 7 Junior Red Cross Chapters with 133 members." That the work of the clubs in Gage County will continue is evidenced by the bulletin from Miss Lula B. Day, County Superintendent of Gage County Schools, October 29, 1936. We quote in part: "Club organizations should be fully in action at this time. The machinery should all be set up, a program made out to cover the year's work. Some tangible achievements and personality growdi should be in evidence before the all-county citizenship meeting in March. The business meeting of your club can be held at the English period, and the parliamentary procedure should he correct. A short peppy meeting is best. Your dub should have a definite goal to accomplish. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Character deficiencies and weaknesses should disappear and new and better trait actions result because of good training in conduct." Space does not permit us to give a report on the club activities of each county. Those given are typical of many others that might have been included. Character Education Emphasized in Normal Training Course* We invite vour attention to the emphasis on character training in the Normal Training Courses for the state. Please see Bulletin A, Professional Training, 1935-1937. There has been increased interest in character training throughout the nation. This is evidenced by recent textbooks for courses on education by magazine publications, and by the many requests for the Nebraska courses by educational leaders in other states. Requests for the bulletins have also been received from Canada, Mexico and the Hawaiian Islands. Character Education Conferences Character education has been emphasized at the annual conference of County Superintendents each year. In addition to these conferences we have held other state conferences at which others have been asked to partici - pate and to plan with us. The first of the state-wide Character Education Conferences was held April 22, 1935. Various plans for character training were discussed, and a better understanding of this was made possible by reports and demonstra - tions. At the request of those attending the conference en April 22, 1935 plans were made for another conference. The second Character Education Conference was held November 14-15, 1935. This was of outstanding significance to Nebraska. State leaders of various organizations participated in group conferences and panel discussions. National speakers addressed the conference and participated in the discussions. National leaders included S 5 i «/ ~ Randall &gt; pr«'dent, Mechanics Institute, Rochester, New York; Mrs. Charles E. Roe, National Field Secretary, National Congress of Parents and Teachers, Washington, D. C; and Dr. Fred J. Kelly, Chief, Division of Higher Education, Office of Education, Department of Interior, Washington, D. C. The addresses were challenging and inspirational. The following organizations participated in the Character Education Conference: Churches of Nebraska, Nebraska Congress of Parents and Teachers, Nebraska State Teachers Association, Women's Christian Tem - perance Union, Nebraska Federation of Women's dubs, Young Women's Christian Association, Girls' Reserves of Nebraska, Young Men's Christian Association, Hi-Y dubs of Nebraska, 4-H dub Leaders of Nebraska Boy </seg>
            <seg id="p221">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Scouts of Nebraska, Girl Scouts of Nebraska, Camp Fire Girls, Junior Red Cross, Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, Kiwanis Clubs, Optimist dubs, American Legion, American Legion Auxiliary. Among the lasting results of the conference should be noted closer cooperation between those who are interested in training the youth of our state, a keener appreciation of the efforts of the various groups, and better coordination of effort. Mrs. M. S. McDuffee, President of the Nebraska Federation of Women's Clubs, has placed special emphasis on the importance of character training. Among suggestions for community activities she gave the follow - ing: (The Nebraska Club Woman, November-December, 1936) "Coopera - tion with die State Department of Education in its efforts to put into effective operation die Character Education Law. This field alone—properly understood and evaluated—would furnish sufficient challenge to every dub in Nebraska for years to come." A State Responsibility In brief, die Nebraska program posits good citizenship to be die result of right attitudes of mind and habits of conduct fixed in a natural and normal environment dirough oft repeated experiences and situations. Coupled with this is the belief that success, or die feeling of success, rather than failure should be a dominant factor in all situations. To the end diat there might be introduced into die schools heretofore more or less formal program, something more characteristic of life itself, Nebraska has sought to utilize die so-called "activities program" and has urged the organization of the life of die school into diose natural and desirable groups of youth after the manner of the dominant interests and activities of the individuals themselves. A pupil organization for activities, therefore, is essential to the success of die plan. Such a program gives the students an opportunity for making choices between right and wrong. It gives an opportunity for the exercising of right choices and die fixing of certain desirable habits, all of which occur under the sympathetic guidance of teachers and other supervisory or admin - istrative leaders. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT DIVISION OF ADULT IMMIGRANT EDUCATION Edith Martin, State Director of Adult Immigrant Education Contents —Introduction—State Law—Number of Illiterates by Counties —Enrollment— Letters —Pictures Conclusion After the World War a wide spread feeling toward patriotism arose throughout the United States. The alien in our midst become a serious problem. Night schools had been conducted in various cities, but for the most part an immigrant wishing to learn our language and become a citizen found it a hardship. Consequendy, thousands from foreign countries had been living here many years and were unable to speak English. A movement was soon under way to set up schools providing for citizenship training as well as training in the common branches for our adult immigrant population. The Nebraska law providing for the Division of Adult Immigrant Education was enacted by die Legislature in 1927: "Compiled Statutes for 1935 — "Section 79-2301. Department of Public Instruction. Adult Immi - grant Educational Division, Establishment, Supervisor. There is hereby established die adult immigrant educational division of the de - partment of public instruction for the education of adult aliens and others under the direction of a state supervisor appointed by the state superintendent of public instruction. "Section 79-2302. Same, Powers of Local School Boards, Courses of Study. Under this act local school boards and school authorities are empowered to expend moneys for conducting schools and classes in school buildings, in industrial establishments, places of employment and other places as may be expedient, for the purpose of giving in - struction to foreign born and native adults and minors over the age of sixteen (16) years. Such courses of instruction or study shall include English, history, civics, and other subjects tending to pro - mote good citizenship and to increase vocational efficiency. "Section 79-2303. Same, Adult Immigrant Education, Duties of State Superintendent. The state superintendent of public instruc - tion shall designate courses of study, approve the selection of teachers, and supervise die instruction in said courses. "Section 79-2304. Same, Disbursement of Funds. The state super - tendent of public instruction is hereby authorized to disburse from funds appropriated for his department sufficient money for super- </seg>
            <seg id="p223">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION vision, instruction, and other necessary expense in conducting the adult immigrant educational division of his department." The Department wishes, to acknowledge the splendid assistance rendered by many city and county superintendents of Nebraska, as well as the splendid cooperation of the various churches and the patriotic organizations, such as the American Legion, American Legion Auxiliary, Daughters and Sons of the American Revolution, American War Mothers, Women's Overseas Ser - vice League, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Auxiliary of Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Colonial Dames. Appropriations sufficient to carry on this work were allowed from 1927 until 1933 when such appropriation was eliminated. In 1933, at the time of the cessation of the appropriation, diere were thirty five teachers in the state with more than 900 prospective citizens en - -"IM in their classes. The lack of funds to carry on was a great handicap, but in a few communities some volunteer work was done. However, this volunteer work was generally ineffective, as interest was not easily maintained nnd teachers were continually changing. In January, 1934, more aliens applied for citizenship papers in the dis - trict offices than in any one of the three previous years. The demand for instruction in citizenship steadily grew. In September, 1934, the Emer - gency Educational Program, a project of the Federal Emergency Relief Ad - ministration, came into effect and it was again possible to establish classes for the foreign born. During the academic year, 1934-1935, there was an enrollment in the citizenship and literacy classes of the state, of approximately 3,000 with seventy-eight teachers employed. Since the latter months of 1935 when the work of the Emergency Edu - cational Program was taken from this Department by the Works Progress Ad - ministration, the adult program continued under the governmental project, to a large extent, although some classes have refused to function with the change and have continued under the direction of this Department. This change may be best explained by the following letters: August 24, 1935. To Counry nnd City Superintendents and Secretaries of Boards of Education: NEW FEDERAL PROGRAM THROUGH PWA Announcement has been made of the appointment by the Works Progress Admin - istrnroi for Nebraska, of Mrs. Paul Bradley, of Omaha, as Assistant Director of the Division of Projects and Planning, in charge of the educaton section to administer the Emergency Education Program. Thp following statement is made in Bulletin No. 19, under the head, "Proposed Scope of the Emergency Education Program in the Works Progress Administration," "Due to the fan that the Works Progress Program is a </seg>

DEFINITELY A RELIEF PROGRAM A representative of this office attended a conference held in St. Louis, where repre - sentatives of the Worts Progress Administration explained the new program. It was stated repeatedly that the new program was primarily designed to take three million five hundred thousand people off relief rolls. It was stated repeatedly that it is a rcii-f program, not an educational program. It was stated again and again that if there could be educational implications it would be fine, but the relief element was primary— the educational element secondary. FULL RESPONSIBILITY CARRIES FULL AUTHORITY Full responsibility naturally carries with it full authority. Our office is set up primarily to administer a State educational program, non-political in character. Wishing to cooperate in every way possible with the Federal Government, we believe that the objectives which it wishes to reach through the agency of the Works Progress Adminiv tration will best be served if along with full authority and full responsibility there also goes absolute freedom of action. To ask one agency to set up a program and give another i&amp;ency authority to veto any or all points of that program at any time is to mark such a program in a measure at least as doomed to 'failure. EXISTING EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES READY TO FUNCTION Give this office full authority and it will accept full responsibility, using the agencies which now east. Nebraska has a full complement of officials already set up This already established agency, including county and city superintendents and boards of education, is in a position to handle any educational responsibility that the Federal Government might see fit to entrust to it. We arc of the opinon that if this were designed fundamentally to be an educational program it would begin by clearing through the United States Office of Education, at Washington. Since we do not have authority we ted that we have no alternative but to gracefully step aside, so that the program ..f the Works Progress Administration may have the utmost freedom. This office desires to cooperate in every way in furnishing information and we arc hoping that county and city superintendents and secretaries of boards of education will in the same manner cooperate with the Educational Director, Mrs. Paul Bradley Mrs Bradley is a woman of splendid attainments, conscientious, a hard worker, and merits in every sense your full confidence.

Dear Mr. Witte: In your letter of October 3 you say: "I am asking our Social Service Division to determine the eligibility of every per - son connected with the educational program and to make recommendations as to which of the projects can be discontinued without much inconvenience to the Works Progress Administration. It is my hope that we can discontinue all education projects under the Nebraska Emergency Relief Administration by October 15 with the possible exception of the nursery schools and the study center projects 'under Professor Reed since costs of the Emergency Education Program must now come out of general funds where special funds are exhausted. Our general funds are needed tor other purposes." Inasmuch as Miss Agnes Saunders, who has supervised the nursery schools under the direction of Mr. Herbert L. Cushing, has already been appointed as supervisor for the nursery schools under the Works Progress Administration we see no reason why the nursery school orojects cannot be speedily transferred to the WPA organization. Per - haps we should add that the Nebraska law makes no provision for school privileges tor children prior to the age of five years. Th* September payroll has not yet come through. In fact, many teachers who rendered service during the month of August are still unpaid. In another letter to Mr. O'shme you stare that, acting under instructions received from Washington, the emergency educational funds have b~n thrown in with the general fund. All of this would seem to ind.cate smII further difficulty in securing the prompt payment of salaries for the teachers employed m the Emergency Education Program workin B under the direction or this office. </seg>

We should be very glad to cooperate in every way possible in clearing up the various details necessary to the making of the transfer 'to the Works Progress Adminis - traton. We do not wish to be charged with the responsibility for the Program after November 1, and we plan to notify the superintendents of the various schools, secretaries of boards of education, and the teachers, of this fact. During the past two years, our connection with the Program was prompted by a desire to cooperate in every way possible with the Federal government in its emergency program. Bulletin No. 19, setting up the new educational program under the Works Progress Administration, clearly stated that where the work had been handled satisfac - torily by a representative of the State Department of Education such an arrangement could be continued. Inasmuch as the Works Progress Administrator did not see fit to continue that arrangement, the only conclusion left is that he did not feel that the program was handled by this office in a satisfactory manner. Considering all of the facts in the case, it appears that this office has accomplishvd all that we can hope to accomplish, and that rhe best interests of the whole program will be served if those who are actually responsible for checking the eligibility of teachers and who are approving payrolls, take over the whole responsibility for the program.

            <seg id="p234">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Conclusion At the present time the work is continuing under the Works Progress Administration of the Federal government, and under the direction of this Department. While many aliens have received their citizenship papers, this achievement does not retard their eagerness to continue their studies, all of which proves a desire for Adult Education in the state of Nebraska. The general Adult Education movement is growing rapidly. Many states already have bulk and maintained large programs. After receiving final citizenship papers, new citizens not only require but request more learning along cultural lines. The state of Delaware has a record chat 'is not only outstanding but enviable, in that it is the only state in the Union that has not asked for, or received, one cent of Federal aid. Delaware has a large program of Adult Education maintained solely by the State Department of Education. </seg>

Cushing, Director, Emergency Educational Program for period of August 1, 1934, to October 31, 1935 in cooperation with the FEDERAL EMERGENCY RELIEF ADMINISTRATION Rowland Haynes, State Administrator October 15, 1933—July 1, 1935 Ernest F. Witte, State Administrator July 1, 1935— </seg>
            <seg id="p236">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT INTRODUCTION The Emergency Educational (relief) Program in Nebraska represents an activity directed by the State Department of Public Instruction and spon - sored by the Federal government through the agency of the Federal Emer - gency Relief Administration. Previous reports covered activities for a period beginning in August, 1933, and ending in December, 1934. There will be some overlapping, how - ever, in order to present the proper statistical report of the last period of the Program. The present summary will deal with the periud beginning Aug - ust 1, 1934, and ending October 31, 1935. Our First Responsiblity The State Department of Public Instruction recognizes that its first re - sponsibility is to the youth of the state who, under the Constitution, are not only entitled to, but who are required, to attend school. Section 6 of Article VII reads: "The legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the common schools of this state of all persons between die ages of 5 and 21 years." The State Department of Education would have preferred to have used available Federal funds in augmenting the educational opportunity which die various school districts of the state are enabled to offer, rather than to branch out in untried and unknown fields. There are many district.', in die state where the educational advantages are limited, due to the fact that one teacher is attempting to handle too many pupils. Thi same funds that were used in launching out into fields that were rather experimental might well have been used in aiding school districts with limited resources in better - ing their offerings. Programs Restricted Certain restrictions were imposed by the Federal government which made it impossible for die local states, through their chosen educational leaders, to select the program that would really have best served the needs of the state. The rules and regulations, laid down by the administrator at Washington and by die state administrator for the FERA, required that certain programs be set up or that no program could be set up. The State Department of Education was desirous of cooperating in every possible way with die Federal government and with those charged with the administration of the relief program in Nebraska. Conflicting Instructions Given While die earliest announcements issued by the national director, Mr. Harry L. Hopkins, repeatedly stressed that the program was primarily one of relief rather than one of education, these early announcements indicated that there would be at least some educational implications. As a matter of </seg>
            <seg id="p237">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION fact, representatives sent out from Washington stated that they had been directed to inform state departments of education that the printed rules and regulations did not mean what they clearly seemed to say, and that the state departments would be permitted to modify the rules and regulations to such an extent that in the last analysis the relief angles would not be as predomi - nant as would the educational angles. It is true that these "ambassadors without portfolio" were unwilling to put their statements into writing. They stated that it was impossible to formulate any setup at Washington which would be equally well adapted to die forty-eight states, and that it was presumed that the director in each state would "use his common sense" and disregard certain rules where local conditions seemed to make it imperative that this be done. It may readily be seen that no end of complications resulted from this, because those in possession of authority in the Emergency Educational (re - lief) Program throughout the state were not given the same instructions. They were told to adhere to die various printed rules and regulations and supplements which were forthcoming from Washington almost daily. When advised of die statements made by those who had been sent out from Wash - ington to assist the state director of the Emergency Educational (relief) Program, die state relief administrator and his many assistants very properly indicated that, having had no such word from Washington, they were obliged to keep within the limits which had been defined for diem. Consequently, all through the Program there was this conflict of administrative audiority, with the final word resting with the state and county relief administrators. Administrative Difficulte* The majority of the people used in the administration of the relief pro - gram were naturally those who had been trained in the field of social work. Regardless of any real cause for differences of opinion between social workers .ind educators, die fact remains that die social worker is concerned fundamen - tally with the relief of certain social conditions. The social worker is con - cerned primarily with the feeding and dodiing of the relief client. The educator very naturally thinks of the child in terms of an individual who already has been fed and clodied and who presents himself for such training as the school has to offer. There is some overlapping of the points of view held by these groups, but their varying points of view do constitute a certain hazard when the administration of a program is left in part to one group and in part to die odier. Probably the greatest handicap that die Emergency Educational (relief) Program encountered was due to the fact diat while educators were expected to outline the various phases of the activities and administer diem up to a certain point, there was always the knowledge that careful and painstaking planning might be nullified by the veto power of die state administrator or some minor assistant entrusted widi die responsibility for which he had not been properly trained. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">v REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Speed Impossible Due "Red Tape" While the instructions from Washington constantly indicated the desire for speed, practically every effort made to secure prompt action was nullified because of administrative difficulties that found their origin in a thousand and one conflicting rules and regulations emanating from those responsible for the FERA program in general. Blanks diat were prepared and submitted, having to do with the eligibility of applicants for positions, were repeatedly lost in die offices of the state administrator.. This meant that the clerical work had to be done over and over again and in some instances it meant that county superintendents, underpaid and widi meager travel allowances, were compelled to drive hundreds of miles over poor roads in order to take care of their eligible applicants. There seemed to be little realization on the part of either the FERA administrator in Washington or in the state office, of the load that they were placing upon these people whose services were volunteered. While diose entrusted with the administrative responsibility under the FERA setup were given liberal travel allowances, neither the state director nor the county or city superintendents who carried a rather heavy load of responsibility could receive any allowance for necessary travel expense. The State Department of Education was called upon to pay out thousands, of dollars for necessary items of expense such as telephone, tele - graph, stationery, and other supplies, and it is safe to assume that county and city superintendents found their already over-burdened budgets consider - ably taxed in order to carry on this additional activity. Regulations Constantly Revised As stated previously, all of the releases from Washington indicated desire for speed and more speed. Yet, before the director could mimeograph instructions and place them in the hands of county and city superintendents and others entrusted with local administration, frequent revisions of these rules would be sent out nullifying all of die time, effort, and expense involved. Obviously, the program was hampered in moving .ihead because of an ui.will - ingness on the part of diose in Washington to entrust definite responsibility » those whom the state had entrusted with die responsibiliy of administering its regular educational program. It seems rather apparent that more speed would have been secured, had the program been more carefully planned at Washington by people conversant with conditions diroughout the country and conversant with some of the obstacles that would confront administrators attempting to operate in sparsely settled areas. Observation led- one to believe diat the administrators in the regular FERA setup could use the telephone and the telegraph at their pleasure, that they could travel long distances without any thought of the expense involved. In fact, some of the requests that came out of Washington indicated that those responsible for the program were laboring under the impression that all of the most rrodern means of transportation and communication were at </seg>
            <seg id="p239">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION our disposal at a moment's notice. A representative of the Federal govern - ment, while in the office, telephoned Washington at an expense of #79.0C without apparently being at all concernced over the matter. The State Department of Public Instruction had no funds available to make it possible to run up telephone expense in any such manner. These rather pertinent and somewhat pointed criticism are voiced in this report, not with the thought of disregarding what the Federal government attempted, presumably with the best of motives, but they are expressed in the hope that they might serve at some time in the future to improve any similar program that might be launched by the government. Appreciation The Director wishes to take this opportunity to express his most sincere appreciation for the splendid service rendered by Miss Agnes Saunders who supervised the nursery school program; Miss Edith Martin, supervisor of the adult education work; Dr. A. A. Reed of the University of Nebraska who directed the study center activities; Dr. C. A. Fulmer, State Director of Vocational Education, who directed the vocational education program. Assistants in Dr. Reed's office who rendered conspicuous service were Mrs. E. E. Thompson and Mr. C. K. Morse. Assistants in Dr. Fulmer's office who worked successfully on behalf of the program were Mrs. Alicia Styer, Mr. J R. Jewell, and Mr. Ivan E. Jones. Particular mention should be made of the fine cooperation of county and city superintendents. No program would have been possible without their aid and it should be kept in mind that, while it added materially to their administrative responsibilities, they received no compensation for their serv - ices. The nation-wide recognition given to the study center program, the adult education and vocational program carried on at Bellevue Vocational School and the transient centers in Omaha under the direction of Dean H. F. Fore, constitute a splendid tribute to the supervisors who directed these activities. The nursery school setup as planned by Miss Saunders, and the manner in which the vocational education program moved forward under the direction of Dr. Fulmer, mark Miss Saunders and Dr. Fulmer as leaders in their particular fields. In writing this final chapter to the Emergency Educational Program no report would be complete without some effort being made to say the things that should be said about the work of Miss Dorothy McCall who has, from the beginning, served as assistant to the director. The multitudinous details involved in the making up of payrolls, checking on the necessary supplies for the various nursery schools and other activities, the handling of vast minutiae of details, constituted her major responsibility. The program could not have functioned successfully without her. </seg>
            <seg id="p240">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The Director wishes to express to Mr. Rowland Haynes, the State Administration of die FERA, and to his successor, Mr. E. F. Witte, his ap - preciation for their patience and thoughtfulness in dealing with die educational phase of the relief program. We are willing to concede that such short - comings as seemed to be apparent in die administrative setup were undoubted - ly due to die tremendous job which diey were undertaking to do in time of stress and turmoil and to die conflicting rules and regulations which they were called upon to interpret. While there were differences of opinion at times as to die best procedure, these differences while freely expressed were ultimately adjusted with bodi Mr. Haynes and Mr. Witte always willing to make reasonable concessions. The people of the state of Nebraska and die teachers and pupils who participated in the Emergency Educational (re - lief) Program have reason to be grateful to both Mr. Haynes and Mr. Witte. Lastly, the Director must pay his respects to his chief, Mr. Charles W. Taylor, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, whose ever loyal backing and support and whose willingness to counsel and guide enabled the program to hurdle some of the barriers that at times seemed almost in - surmountable. No one could ask for, nor receive, finer support than that given by State Superintendent Taylor. ***** ORGANIZATION OF THE EMERGENCY EDUCATIONAL (RELIEF) PROGRAM August 1934-1935 October HERBERT L. CUSHING Director Emergency Educational Program Dorothy McCall Assistant Director Emergency Educational Program Agnes Saunders _ Federal Supervisor Emergency Nursery Schools Edith Martin Federal Supervisor Adult Education On July 10, 1934, this office received a copy of the following communi - cation which was addressed to State Emergency Relief Administrations: "Your relief commission is authorized to use Federal relief funds now available or to be made available by the Federal Relief Ad - ministration to pay wages to needy unemployed persons competent to teach or perform other types of necessary service in connection with the following education projects: ADULT EDUCATION 1. Literacy Classes —to teach adults unable to read and write English. 2. Vocational Training —for unemployed adults who are in need of vo^ cational training or adjustment to make them employable, in the following fields: </seg>
            <seg id="p241">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION a. Trade and industrial education. b. Home economics education. c. Agricultural education. d. Commercial education. In the case of persons without previous wage-earning experience as stenographers, typists, bookkeepers, or accountants, they may only be admitted to classes in these subjects if they are unemployed adults on relief. e. Vocational adjustment and counseling for unemployed adults. In general, classes organized in any phase of the above named fields are expected to supplement and render special services to unemployed adults other than that now being provided, or to be offered by the estab - lished program of vocational education in the states. 3. Vocational Rehabilitation —for unemployed adults who are physi - cally handicapped and need additional training in work opportunities. Funds for this project may be expended for the following items, under the approved budget distribution in your State Plan. a. Salaries of case and clerical workers and instruction for trainees, 53 per cent or over. b. Travel of case workers and trainees, not over 5 per cent. c. Supplies and equipment for trainees, not over 8 per cent. d. Artificial appliances and/or maintenance, not over 34 per cent. In general, rehabilitation work under this authorization is expected to supplement and render a type of service to unemployed adults other than that regularly provided by the established program of vocational rehabilitation in the states. Case workers authorized are city case workers or located in densely populated areas, not assistant state supervisors under another name. Work with crippled or handicapped children below thi age of legal employability is not authorized. &gt;.". 4. General Adult Education —for unemployed and other adults who are in need of further general educational opportunities to fit them to take their part as self-respecting citizens; in such fields as the follow - ing: a. Workers' education. b. Parent education. c. Avocational training, hobbies and handicraft classes. d. General academic education. e. General informal education. f. Cultural education. </seg>
            <seg id="p242">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT NURSERY SCHOOLS—to develop the physical and mental well-being of pre-school children in needy unemployed families or neglected or under - privileged homes. The above broad educational projects are the only ones you are at present authorized to use relief funds to develop. It is not permissible to use relief funds to place unemployed teachers in the regular public schools, as "helping" teachers, to relieve so-called "over-crowded condi - tions," to teach home-bound, mentally deficient, or retarded children, or to teach music, recreation or other activities in the regular grades of the public schools. Eligibility—selection of workers is made on the basis of need, de - termined for relief by the Relief Administrations. The method of need determinations shall be by means of a questionnaire filed with the Relief Administration, and verified by a professional or technical organization, or by a case worker. This verification may be made monthly or bi - monthly. A copy of the questionnaire suggested by this office is at - tached. States wishing to alter this form must receive approval for changes from this office. Beginning August first an additional allotment will be made to your state and you will be given a definite quota of teachers to cover those already at work and those to be employed. It is my hope that during the summer and early fall, attention will be concentrated on reducing the percentage of illiteracy in your state. Sometime later this fall, after your programs of adult education and nursery schools have developed to the point where needed, it is my hope to increase this work to the point where 40,000 persons competent to teach will be employed throughout the United States. Sincerely yours, (Signed) Harry L. Hopkins, Administrator, Federal Emergency Relief Administration, Washington. D. C." This letter constituted the authorization for the Emergency Educational relief program which was carried on during the fifteen-month period of Augusr 1, 1934, to October 31, 1935. About August 1 we were advised by the State Administrator that the sum of $11,600.00 would be available for die Emergency Educational (relief) Program in August. Under date of August 30 we were advised that our allotment had been increased to the amount of #22,700.00 monthly, and we were requested to prepare our budget accordingly. Shortly after receiving this notice, the following budget was set up: </seg>

You will note that the letter quoted previously authorized only two lines of activity through the FERA, namely, adult education and nursery schools. In the first months of 1935, however, so forcibly was the needy plight of hundreds of school districts brought to the attention of national and state administrators, that this office was able to effect a transfer of accumulated, unused Emergency Educational (relief) funds to an allocation for these dis - tricts. Hundreds of applications showing maximum effort were received from school districts. Final approval was made on the Basis of maximum effort as to levy made, bonded and registered warrant indebtedness, ease or difficulty encountered in cashing registered warrants.

Cushing, Director, Emergency Educational Program, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. My dear Mr. Cushing: On September 15, 1934, when I was appointed supervisor of adult edu - cation under the Emergency Educational Program, I started the work in Omaha and the first classes to function were Americanization and citizenship for adult foreigners. These classes were discontinued July 1, 1933, until which time they had been a state activity, but it did not take long to resume activities. The termination of the classes in 1933 was the result of lack of available funds in appropriations by the state legislature. At Central high school where this work had been going on for many years six teachers were placed in charge. With the help of Mrs. Morris Katie - man the work went on through the Jewish Community Center with eight teachers conducting home classes. At the YMCA, South Side Social Settle - ment, Christ Child Center, and Labor Lyceum Temple, large classes were quickly organized and Miss Kathleen O'Grady who has done a great deal of this work soon started classes among the Jewish and Italian people. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION I next turned to the Federal Transient Bureau where I placed Mrs. Edith Gray to teach the colored illiterates. She started with a class of thirty - five colored men and by Christmas each man under her direction was able to write a letter to his home folks. After a conference with Mr. S. S. Cald - wiell. Work Director of the Federal Transient Bureau, 1 placed Mr. Harry F. Fore, who had been dean of the College of Education at Creighton Uni - versity, in charge of the educational work. Besides Mrs. Gray his teaching force consisted of three men teachers. The program grew rapidly extending to the boys' camp in Plattsmouth and on January 1, 1935, the old Presby - terian College at Bellevue was taken over by the government and turned into the Bellevue Vocational School. At the present time it has a faculty of thirty-five teachers and an enrollment of 250 students and more than 100 men and boys have been placed in permanent positions from the educational program carried on in this school. I also have in my files a detailed report submitted by Mr. Fore. Classes in Lincoln were organized by Mr. M. C. Lefler, superintendent of schools, and he employed throughout the year twenty-two teachers in literacy and general adult classes. Scotts Bluff and Morrill counties in die western part of the state had large night classes in die following communities: Scottsbluff, Gering, Mina - tare, Mitchell, and Bayard. More dian 600 were enrolled in citizenship and English classes and many drove thirty-five miles four nights a week to at - tend classes. A reception for twenty-five new citizens was given by the patriotic societies and civic clubs of Scottsbluff and Gering at Scottsbluff the evening of April 25. Albion had a splendid adult program under the direction of Supt. Don R. Leech, and instruction was given in such subjects as English, dramatics, music, current events, public speaking, and parliamentary law. In February, T addressed their commencement exercises as die program had been planned for only ten weeks. However, the interest was so keen that they rc-«nrolled that night for another ten weeks with a much larger registration. In January, large night schools were started in both Hastings and Hum - boldt. They did excellent work and interest was maintained. Hastings is continuing classes during the summer but Humboldt was forced to close due to lack of cooperation on the part of die relief authorities in diat county. Grand Island had two large groups of foreigners and an interesting music class. Wahoo, Lynch, and Butte had large classes in music and we did excellent work with community orchestras diere. Mrs. Dora Schainost of Gilead performed an outstanding piece of work for many years among the foreigners in Jefferson and Thayer counties. She taught every evening and had die enviable record that no one of die many hundred aliens she assisted in securing citizenship papers had to make appli - cation for relief. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Dwight, a small town in a Bohemian locality, had three large classes in citizenship during the winter. L In November, 1934, Major S. M. Ransopher invited me to attend a meeting of educational advisers of CCC camps, held in Kansas City. As a result I was able to place about fifty teachers in the following Nebraska CCC camps: Albion, Blair, Beatrice, David City, Fairbury, Fullerton, Fort Crook, Fort Robinson, Gering, Harrington, Minatare, Nebraska City, Nelson, Nio - brara, Ponca, Ravenna, Red Cloud, Tekamah, and Tecumseh. It has been my aim to contact each teacher by letter, visit, or conference each month throughout the year, and this has been carried out with the ex - ception of the western part of the state where I have been less frequendy. However, Mr. C. E. Clyde was appointed supervisor of this work and car - ried it on with Mr. Wayne Johnson, principal of die Scottsbluff night school, in a splendid manner. Many conferences have been held and letters ex - changed with city and county superintendents and relief supervisors looking forward to next year's program which promises to be much larger than this past year if conditions continue the same. My work has been along two lines—literacy and general adult education. The literacy has consisted largely of Americanization work among the foreign adults and the uneducated negroes. The general adult program has been wide in its scope, including classes in English, current events, public speaking, dramatics, music, art, hobbies, and so forth. I want to make particular mention of the work bfing done by Mrs. Carrie Dunlap and Mrs. Irene Olmstead of Omaha in their hobby classes. They have gone among the people on relief rolls in their sections of the city and have done excellent work in encouraging and instructing them in rug making, knitting, crocheting, sewing, and darning and patching clothes. They are preparing a most unique exhibit of their work for the State Fair. Colored Classes The work among the colored population has been particularly interesting Mr. J. Harvey Kerns of the Urban League had a good program well under way when he was transferred to New York City. Mr. B. E. Squires, who succeeded him, is carrying on and enlarging Mr. Kerns' program. Miss Rachel Taylor of the North Side YWCA has used two teachers to good advantage. Mrs. M. L. Rhone, head resident of Woodson Center, colored branch of the South Side Social Settlement, is outstanding in her program. She is located in the packing house district and has made her program attractive enough to keep boys and girls who have graduated from high school off the streets and out of mischief and trouble. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION I attended three of her programs. One Sunday afternoon I attended a tea where a most interesting discussion on Negro history, particularly the life of Booker T. Washington, was entered into by a group of sixty. A style revue at the South Side Social Settlement was well staged and on Mothers' Day a musical program at the ABME Church was outstanding. An octet of young men lately out of high school sang a group of spirituals in a way I have never heard surpassed. Mrs. Rhone has said she would send a detailed report of her activities which I will have in my files for your reference, as are several pictures from these three scenes of the activities just described. Workers' Education Early in November, I attended a conference on Workers' Education. This was held at the University of Chicago and was under the direction of Miss Hilda Smith of Washington, D. C. Upon my return to Nebraska I met with the Labor groups in Omaha and Lincoln and talked with the state officers of the American Federation of Labor. I was unable to gain their cooperation in starting these classes among their people due to a certain prejudice which they held. During the last month the state president, Mr. Britt Pryor, has made several calls at this office and has invited me to be a speaker at their state convention which will be held in Columbus early in September. He is rather in favor of starting classes among his groups this coming year, provided the right subjects and teachers can be found to carry on. Three discussion or forum groups have met weekly in Omaha: one at the YMCA led by Dean H. F. Fore, one at the Federal Transient Bureau led by Mr. J. H. Norris, and one at the Bellevue Vocational School led by Mr. Ralph Werthman. Interesting classes studying Negro history have also been held weekly at the following colored settlement houses: South Side Social Settlement, Woodson Center, Mid-City Urban League, and North Side YWCA. A recent letter from Miss Hilda Smith, specialist in Workers' Educv ton, Washington, and a telephone call from Mr. J. M. Besore, state super - visor of Workers' Education in Kansas, inform me that a six weeks' training course is to be held in Manhattan, Kansas, beginning August 5. Nebraska is requested to send ten teachers which number is being approved through relief channels at the present time. At the invitation of Miss Hilda Smith I am planning to spend some time at the school in Manhattan.

            <seg id="p248">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Admit Education in the Negro Race (Report prepared by Mr. Bernard E. Squires, Executive Secretary, Urban League Community Center, Omaha, Nebraska) Mazzine, the philosopher, once said, "The true emancipation of the people can be effected only through the conscience of the people." This statement, though made many years ago, is in truth quite applicable to the American negro today. At present, the seventieth anniversary of his eman - cipation is being celebrated throughout the land, but because of the lack of development of an impressionable and plastic conscience brought about by die faulty and grossly inadequate educational systems established for negroes in these regions where his percentage of population was higher, he has never been allowed an opportunity to develop a high standard of character, con - science, and intellect, at least on a basis of large numbers which would tend toward true and complete emancipation. Even today, as in die days immediately following his emancipation, he is not given an opportunity to participate in die pursuit of an education on an equal basis as his white fellow citizen. His term of educaton is shorter, his material equipment poorer and in many instances his possibilities of pur suing educational desires to a profitable end are lessened because of economic and financial interferences. These things have served as prominent impedimentar/ factors in his ef - forts of achievement and die establishment of economic security. The generation of Negro youth today is fortunate in diat many of these detrimental factors are fast disappearing. However, diis same generation finds itself in die throes of a conflict between dieir teachings of today and the ideals of dieir parents which are products of die forementioned faulty preparatory .possibilities. Such a conflict, if left unheeded, could become so critical in its nature diat it might easily offset and destroy die efforts of our present day educators in dieir dealings with die youth of today. It is at this point diat die adult education program enters the picture. This program, designed originally for die education of adult persons who, for one reason or another, have been denied a fully rounded and educa - tional opportunity, has done much toward alleviating die previously referred to crisis between die older and younger generations of this day of great eco - nomic and social disorder. Parents unable to comprehend and condone some of die actions, atti - tudes and adherences of dieir children have been greatly aided in this respect by participation in some of die classes of die adult education program. With - in die Negro communities of Omaha there are being conducted courses in child and adolescent psychology. Parents have been enabled to develop a greater tolerance toward their children and dieir place in die home which has been so greatly altered by die unprecedented, * drastic changes in die indus- </seg>
            <seg id="p249">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION trial and social orders of today. Classes in homemaking, marketing, meai planning and cooking, sewing, contemporary economics, parent-teacher rela - tionships, and so forth, have brought great and desired changes in the com - munity. While these classes have done much in their way, they have been sup - plemented with well attended classes of cultural and academic natures. The community has benefited by classes in music, singing, both individual and choral, typing and shorthand, English, salesmanship and public speaking. The enrollment and attendance in these classes are sufficient evidence of the desire for improvement and devlopment to justify die existence of such classes and the necessary effort and expenses related thereto. A brief summary of the July monthly reports of the adult education class conducted through the Omaha Urban League Community Center by the Emergency Educational Program of the state of Nebraska under the supervision of Miss Edith Martin, supervisor, discloses the following: course; in homemaking, marketing, sewing, meal planning and cooking, music, sing - ing, child and adolescent psychology, shorthand and typing, English, public speaking, salesmanship, and current economic problems, total fourteen. Number of classes 14 Enrollments 185 approximately Attendance 667 approximately Number of institutions participating 6 Number of homes visited 55 Number of persons contacted 1050 Truly such a program and summary are indicative of the development of a high standard of conscience which will lead to the "true emancipation of the peoples." Adult Educational Program at Bellevue Vocational School (Report prepared by Mr. H. F. Fore, Educational Director at Bellevue Vocational School, Bellevue, Nebraska) The educational and recreational project at the Bellevue Vocational School grew out of die educational experiment which we developed for tran - sients at our Omaha Center last fall (1934). We began there in a very modest way, conducting at first small classes in literacy and citizenship. As we developed interest in the work among the men, we enlarged our classes and increased our number of subjects. Be - sides our formal dasswork, we instituted a course of lectures by business and professional men in the city given on Wednesday nights, and another course of lectures on "Modern Economic Problems" given by die educational direc - tor on Saturday nights. In our lecture course we have had excellent coop - eration by Creighton University and Omaha Municipal University, bodi of </seg>
            <seg id="p250">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT which have furnished us excellent speakers whenever we asked for them. The speakers unanimously expressed themselves as having never before spoken for more attentive and appreciative audiences. Both of these projects were very successful. Altogether, out of a total of about 1,100 men, we con - tacted each week 500 or more. At the dose of each of these meetings, the men were given opportunity for discussion of the subject. Many of the com - ments by die men were surprisingly intelligent. At each meeting in the course on "Economic Problems" die director gave a list of books and articles on die subject. It was gratifying to find that some of the men read every reference given, and that many went to the Public Library for additional m.-i - terial. Encouraged by the success of our work at die Omaha Center, abouc December 1 we leased the buildings of an abandoned college, ten miles south of Omaha, which we rehabilitated for educational work. The college is al - most ideally situated on a hill overlooking the Missouri River. The grounds comprise 55 acres, including a beautiful campus of about 30 acres, and about 20 acres which we are using for truck gardening. There are seven buildings: a three-story recitation hall; a gymnasium; a ten-room residence; and a set of four dormitories which will accommodate very comfortably 250 students. The dining room and kitchen occupy die basement floor in one of the buildings, and a large well-lighted recreation room is located in the basement of anothe-. The selection of men whom we sent to our school was carefully done. They were chosen from the Center in Omaha and from a boys' camp at Plattsmouth. We have tried to select only tliose who manifested a definite desire for further education, and who gave evidence of good moral character. The ages of the students range from 16 to approximately 40 years. A recent survey of our students indicates that 52 per cent are under 25 years of age, and present intake will show an even higher percentage. Most of the young men in diis group are untrained, and have never been employed in any regular vocational work. Many of the men above 25 years of age are un - skilled, or semi-skilled. It is our purpose to make all these, not semi-skilled workers, but skilled artisans. We think we proceeded wisely when we sent the men out to the school in small groups. The first group of about 20 came out December 27 to initi - ate die work of die renovation of the buildings and grounds. This group, made up of high-grade men, set up their own code of behavior and conduct which has done much to maintan the morale and morals of the institution. Gradually we increased our numbers until we now have about 190 men. We expect to add to this number as suitable men are found. About 10 per cent of our men come from Nebraska, the rest from other states. When men register at our Omaha Transient Camp they are told about our school here. If they manifest an interest, they are sent to the edu - cation office where they are interviewed and a check is made on their history and education in the registration office. If it is felt that the applicants would </seg>
            <seg id="p251">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION benefit by taking any of our courses, they are sent here. Naturally, we have made a great many mistakes, but we are succeeding in selecting a group of very capable and desirable young men and boys. As soon as our school was definitely established, we began search for competent teachers. Most of our faculty, now consisting of about thirty, have come from FERA, through Miss Edith Martin, State Supervisor of Adult Education, and Mr. J. R. Hawke, Supervisor of Vocational Education for the state department. Seven or eight of our best teachers, however, have been drawn from the Transient Center at Omaha. As our whole project was experimental, we developed first the subjects that involved the least expense and equipment, and seemed most likely to prove popular. As rapidly as possible we added other courses. We now have in Vocational Training classes: bookbinding, bricklaying and cement work, mechanical shoe repairing, truck gardening, newspaper work, tailoring, practical farming, show-card lettering, mechanical drawing, boiler firing, sta - tionary engineering, cooking, wood-working, dairying, stage designing, weld - ing, landscaping, electrical work, salesmanship, shorthand and typewriting, nnd bookkeeping. In the general Adult Education courses we have: English, grammar, business arithmetic, industrial arithmetic, dramatic art, voice cul - ture, geometry, trigonometry, business English, piano instruction, public speaking, and hospital training. The most popular of these courses are: typewriting, salesmanship, acety - lene welding, shoe repairing, truck gardening, mechanical drawing, bookkeep - ing, and cooking. We have been most successful in placing men in salesman - ship, cooking, electrical work, welding and truck gardening. Each man is required to take a vocational subject in which he has al - ready had some experience or in which he manifests some aptitude, and as many other academic subjects as his detail work, approximately 30 hours a week, will permit him to take. We lay emphasis upon having every man get n knowledge of elementary English and arithmetic. Insofar as possible we are trying to give our men, along with their vocational work, a cultural back - ground. Most of our students see the importance of this side of their edu - cation and take advantages of the opportunities offered them. From the outset, we planned our courses to cover approximately a sem - ester 'or a year, but broke them up into definite small units, each of which could be covered in four to six weeks. The results of this have proved the wisdom of the plan. We have operated on the belief that one of the best means of stabiliza - tion is through recreation; therefore, that side of our program has been given considerable emphasis. Our regular recreational program now consists of motion pictures two evenings each week. Plays, pageants, vaudeville sketches, and athletic sports constitute a part of our student activities. As far as pos- </seg>
            <seg id="p252">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT sible, we try to have our students direct their own recreational activities. The plan works well, and we have no difficulty whatever in finding men and boys to carry on this part of our work very efficiently. I might say in this connection that we were likewise fortunate in being able to use about one thousand volumes of the college library which the trustees were good enough to give to us. We are adding to this nucleus a great many books and magazines donated by the citizens of Omaha. I have written to approximately 50 of the clubs in the city for discarded books and magazines of their members, and have been very successful in securing reading material from these sources. Our students have manifested an admirable spirit by entering into the social and other activities in Bellevue and Omaha. A quartet of our boys sing in one of the churches of Omaha, and a double quartet and trio in one of the Bellevue churches. Some have charge of the Bellevue Boy Scouts. Several who are particularly interested in some subject have organized in - formal dasswork; for example, one boy interested 12 students in botany; another, ten students in writing, and another, a group of 10 or 12 in freehand drawing. Last week, 25 of our boys volunteered their services and worked all night in building levees to control a flood of the Missouri River; others have done considerable work in the city park. Should our school be estab - lished permanently, there is enough work here to keep the boys busy for years in improving our campus and carrying on projects in the town to make this one of the most beautiful spots in this section of the country. As I have said the objective of our vocational school is to rehabilitate our students and to develop unskilled and semi-skilled workers into skilled artisans. From all indications, we feel strongly that if we can make our school and its environment attractive enough to hold our men—and I believe we can —I am sure that we shall succeed in our project. Naturally, with such an objective as ours, we shall attempt to find jobs for the men as soon as we feel that they are proficient in any vocation. To this end, we are making contacts widi business and industry, and are meeting with encouraging res - ponses. We have already been instrumental in making more than a hundred men self-supporting by placing them in jobs that will make a living for them. (The above report was prepared as of July 31, 1935, and since the general report was not compiled until after the close of the Emergency Educational Program under die FERA on November 1, 1935, the following additional comment is made by Mr. Fore as of the latter date:) To October 16 we had taken off die road, and rehabilitated, 289 men. Of these, 69 secured positions direcdy through our training, and 67 indirecdy. The others had been sent to tlieir homes, where many of them had positions, or to schools and colleges. </seg>

Fulmer, who, in his capacity as director of the State Department of Vocational Education, acted as supervisor or this work.) July 10, 1935 Mr. Herbert L. Cushing, Director, Nebraska Emergency Educational Program, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Cushing: Your communication under date of June 25, 1935, requesting a report on the emergency educational program for die past year, insofar as it relate* to vocational training and vocational rehabilitation was received. In the communication you requested a statement covering (1) die major objectives which have guided us in formulating diis program, (2) die chief difficulties we have encountered, (3) a rather complete explanation of any plans or devices diat have functioned particularly well, (4) a general state - ment or an estimate of the worthwhileness of the program, and (5) sugges - tions for die improvement of future programs. Vocational Training 1. Major objectives. a. As far as possible, we have utilized die people employed to supplement rather than to augment die regular program of vocational education. b. We organized die program to cover certain phases of home economics education, necessary to die immediate welfare of mothers and dieir families on or in need of relief, or who were unemployed, and also various types of trade, industrial and office training diat would prepare inexperienced unemployed persons for wage earning or increase die efficiency of die experienced unemployed persons in order diat diey might more easily adjust diemselves to the ever changing occupational standards and conditions. c. The program has emphasized die building up of die morale of dis - couraged unemployed people as diey look forward to a better day. d. The profitable use of leisure time has also figured in die work. e. Anodier objective was to draw as many persons as possible into em - ployment as teachers of the unemployed. 2. Chief difficulties encountered. a. Finding qualified persons who were eligible under die rules for ap - proval as teachers. It must be remembered diat to teach successfully </seg>
            <seg id="p254">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT classes of restless, discouraged unemployed people of varying grades of mentality and previous training and schooling requires the highest type of teachers. b. Lack of definite advance information from Federal authorities con - cerning rules and regulations and methods of procedure. c. Frequent changes in policies handed down from government officials. d. No Federal funds available for assistance in supervision or additional office help. In odier words, the staffs of this department and of the various city schools with which the department cooperated in the emergency program, already heavily loaded with regular work have been obliged to carry an exceedingly heavy load. 3. Plans or devices that have functioned particularly well. a. Placing responsibility for the emergency program with this office staff and with local school administrators and staffs who have the adminis - tration of the regular program of vocational training. The experience of these people has greatly facilitated and expedited the work. The machinery was already set up and ready for use. In other words, the administration of an emergency program should bt placed with regu - larly constituted educational organizations. 4. Worthwhileness of the program. a. The value of the program can be judged by the enthusiasm and inter - est of the thousands of adults who have received training in such courses of instruction as are listed below. Generally speaking, the interest was sustained throughout the nine months of the year. Home Economics Commercial Trade and Industrial Parent education .

Suggestions for improvement of future programs. a. Earmark funds for emergency educational work for an entire year and place administration of the program together with expenditure of funds with the State Department of Education. This plan would save much confusion and add to the efficiency of the work. b. Permit the use of a percentage of the funds for such supervisory and clerical assistance as may be necessary. c. Return warrants for payment of supplies purchased to this office in order that we may know when payments are made. Vocational Rehabilitation 1. The training of physically disabled persons and placing them in remuner - ative employment is the major objective of the program. 2. Chief difficulties encountered. a. Delay in setting up a working agreement with Federal officials. This is a complicated program and the expenditure of much time and effort was necessary to arrive at an understanding of details of procedure relating to tuition, maintenance, instructional supplies, artificial ap - pliances, case workers, cooperation with relief and employment agencies, and so forth. The program did not get under way until about the middle of the year. b. Difficulty in carrying out working agreement with Federal officials on account of misunderstanding of details of procedure. c. These difficulties could be avoided if the State Department of Educa - tion had the administration of the work as suggested under (I) Voca - tional Training. Respectfully submitted, (Signed) C. A.

The Emergency Educational (relief) Program provided a local director of the extension work and furnished facilities in cooperation with local boards of education to approximately two hundred persons in Nebraska to be accredited with college hours at a minimum cost. Many more would-be students could have been served, had it not been for two deterrent elements, namely: (1) A center could not be organized until ten or more enrollees could be found, and in many communities this was a prohibitive number; (2) In many cases even the nominal cost per college hour to cover printing and mailing was prohibitive to potential en - rollees. The Study Center program, however, was fostered in this state to such an extent as to result in its enthusiastic acceptance by adults of all types and ages. Its success was great enough to bring particular comment and attention from Washington, and to stimulate the organization of a similar program in other states. November 1, 1935 Mr. Herbert L. Cushing, Director, Emergency Educational Program, Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Mr. Cushing: I herewith submit a report of the emergency nursery schools as they were organized and functioned under your direction and my supervision from August 1, 1934, to November 1, 1935. I am afraid that in trying to give a concrete picture of our endeavor I have gone more into detail than was necessary. If I have, you will have to put it down to enthusiasm over a program that developed under your encouragement and support, and the interest and cooperation of the city superintendents and local communities, into a much better and more perman - ent organization than I had hoped for, even in my most sanguine moments. The work has been pronounced good, the results satisfactory. May I be permitted to express my deep appreciation for your hearty support in all my ventures, and your keen understanding of needs and diffi - culties encountered. It has been a pleasure as well as training to work under you and Superintendent Taylor, and I wish to thank you both for the many courtesies extended to me. Hoping that I may again have the pleasure of association with the State Department of Public Instruction, I am Most respectfully, i (Signed) Agnes Saunders Supervisor, Emergency Nursery Schools </seg>
            <seg id="p257">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION I Introducton The movement which has propelled the emergency nursery school pro - gram of Nebraska into the stage which we find it at the end of October, 1935, has had three cycles which, while fraught with some radical changes and many minor internal disruptions, have in the main contributed to J steady improvement of program and a sound philosophy of nursery school education in the state. Nursery schools were first ushered in under the wing of Woman's Work under CWS, organized as a work relief project to give work to women. As the main emphasis was placed on numbers put to work we find the units at this time staffed with an often appalling array of persons—seamstresses, home visitors, nutritionalists, nurses, cooks and housekeepers, as well as a goodly number of teachers and others particularly engaged in the care and guidance of their charge—"undernourished preschool children of relief families." Persons partially qualified to teach and care for young children of preschool age were given training by die cooperative efforts of the depart - ments of education and home economics of the Unievrsity of Nebraska. About twenty persons, selected by local superintendents of schools and odiers from various parts of the state, came to Lincoln and were insrtucted for one month in such subject matter pertaining to nursery school education as could be given in short intensive courses arranged especially to meet the needs of inexperienced and often immature persons. Twelve centers, and a few abortive ones, were set up. Their program thrived for several months under the sponsorship of CWS. But because of its unwieldly organization, top-heavy staff, increasing operating expenses, and much supervision from contending sources, the units at the end of die first period of their existence were definitely in need of reorganization, not that they had been conceived and planned with intelligence and understanding, but so many currents of authority constandy cut across their padi that healthy development was not possible. In the meantime, and continuing concurrently with the above described units, six nursery schools, initiated and organized by a representative from Washington, D. C, were opened. These units, set up primarily for educa - tional purposes rather than physical relief, were sponsored by die State De - partment of Public Instruction, and supervised by a professor of nursery school education loaned from the University of Nebraska. These schools properly equipped, staffed and supervised, made an exceptional showing in contributing largely to information regarding the training of the preschool child as well as to the part nursery school education might play in general education in the state of Nebraska. They continued until die end of diat school year in June, 1934, at which time they suspended operations until later absorbed by the Emergency Educational Program of 1934-35 sponsored by the State Department of Public Instruction. </seg>
            <seg id="p258">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT In April, 1933, the program previously described as initiated by CWS was transferred to the Social Service Division of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. A supervisor was appointed to revamp the organi - zations there known as Health and Nutrition Centers, paying especial atten - tion to number of persons employed, their qualifications and duties, costs of operation, strengthening the educational aspects of the program as well as the physical care of the children. At the close of June, 1934, most of these units closed. Two, however, continued through another month; while the one at Scottsbluff which had earned for itself a sort of social service reputation continued on through the summer, closing only for extensive repairs and alterations to be made to the building it was occupying, and opening again to continue without interruption until the present time. The next epoch in the history of the nursery school program opened in the fall of 1934. At the beginning of the fiscal year 1934-35 funds were earmarked by Harry Hopkins, Federal Administrator of Emergency Relief, for relief in education. At that time nursery schools, as well as other specific phases of education, were placed under the State Department of Public Instruction with special direction and supervision provided in its several phases. Funds were immediately made available. The first of August found several nursery schools in operation, with many others planning to open at the beginning of the school year. II Location of Emergency Nursery Schools The location of the nursery schools in Nebraska is indicated on the attached map. The way they had been scattered over the state has been due partly to chance, but more to the selection of centers where the relief load is the highest—five are within the river counties, three in Lancaster county. Those counties bear fully one-half, if not more, of the entire load of the state. There are more in the eastern half of the state where popu - lation is greatest. The others, outside of Buffalo and Scotts Bluff counties, are located in small towns and villages. This has been a source of gratifi - cation to town officials and city superintendents of small school systems, who often feel that small or isolated communities cannot share in the newer phases of education because of many restrictions. No barriers have been placed on size of any town in establishing nursery schools in Nebraska, if needs were demonstrable, space was available, and the school authorities ready and willing to accept sponsorship of the project. The question often asked is, "Where is the best nursery school in the state?" Individually, they are so different in their strengths and weaknesses that it has been impossible to rate them according to any objective standard. There are, however, outstanding characteristics in each unit which may be designated thus: Scottsbluff—Outstanding in the cooperation and generosity secured from the local community. </seg>
            <seg id="p259">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Central School, Omaha; Clinton School, Lincoln; Saratoga School, Lincoln—Cooperation and assistance given by the school principals. Aurora—Care and guidance given to its youngest enrollees. Kearney, Ord—Number of vicissitudes endured to rise to still higher standards. Cambridge—Time and intelligent interest contributed to it by the school officials and their wives. Albion—Strong and well sustained interest in parent education. Ord—Improvement in its educational activities. West Side, Omaha; Superior; Blair—Ingenuity and resourcefulness displayed in play equipment and materials with resultant happy children. Havelocfc School, Lincoln; Central School, Omaha—Efficiency in business management with highest adequacy of food at reduced costs. Crawford—Success achieved in spite of distance from Lincoln and scarceness of supervision. Nebraska City—Support and assistance given by local medical authorities. South Sioux City—Coordination with the elementary grades of the public school system. Ill Procedures for Establishing Emergency Nursery Schools Projects for nursery schools are initiated through the request from local superintendents of public schools, and sent to State Department of Public Instruction who in turn refers them to state supervisor of nursery schools who makes direct contacts with the local school authorities to investigate: a. Local facilities for housing the contemplated nursery school eivine primary attention to: 1. Adequate space for indoor and outdoor play, preparation and serving of noonday meals, sleeping, toilet and lavatory facilities, sunlight, sanitation, fire protection, and traffic hazards. b. The number and qualifications of persons eligible for relief who have been designated for employment in the nursery school. </seg>
            <seg id="p260">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT c. The number of children of relief clients between the ages of two to four years, inclusive, in the community, who will be able to attend die nursery school. d. The demonstration possibilities of die nursery school to the local community in general, and to all parents in particular, in the care and education of the preschool child. 2. Teaching personnel for a nursery school of thirty to thirty-five children is five persons—a director or head teacher, assistant teacher, nurse, house manager, and cook. The addition of another assistant teacher is advised where die enrollment approaches forty. A custodian for janitorial care may be added when the nursery school is housed in a separate building. 3 The average cost of running a nursery school in Nebraska is approxi - mately $75.00 per week. The average salary and wage schedule for localities other than the two largest cities is: Director or head teacher — $71.50 per mondi Assistant teacher _ 65.00 per mondi Registered nurse 65.00 per month House manager ._ 7 hours daily at .30 per hour Cook _ 5 hours daily at .30 per hour (Omaha and Lincoln schedule) Director or head teacher $78.00 per month Assistant teacher _. 71.50 per month Registered nurse 65.00 per month House manager _ 7 hours daily at .40 per hour Cook .._ _ 5 hours daily at .40 per hour 4. Equipment has been taken care of primarily dirough the public school system sponsoring the project. However, in many instances, community and fraternal organizations and odier groups have made substantial contributions. An allotment of 5 per cent of die total salary budget for each unit is allowed for "consumable supplies." Local "work relief" projects in die initial organization of the nursery school in some cases have made furnishings and equipment, the local community furnishing the materials. 5. The food budget was estimated on a flat rate of 10 cents per child per day where codliver oil was supplied as a "commodity" by the FERA locally. The actual groceries were purchased on regulation food order slips issued by the division of direct relief FERA. The allowance of food was designed to furnish one-half the required number of calories for the child per day. The regular purchasing of die food was done by a com- </seg>
            <seg id="p261">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION petent person on the nursery school staff. The actual cost per child per day ranged from 6.5 cents to 11 cents, with the average 8.7 cents. 6. Selection of teachers— Since nursery schools are established to provide employment for teachers who are out of work, the individuals who may be selected as nursery school teachers are brought to die attention of die administration officer because they are unemployed. The selection of teachers for emergency schools is, in the nature of the case, particularly difficult. The schools are established to provide employment for teachers out of work, but the educational implications of the program suggest a second function—the training of young chil - dren. There is placed upon this emergency organization responsibility for producing educational results within a relief fituation. But since educators are primarily interested in education rather than in relief, they are necessarily concerned with the quality of the schools which are being established. The ultimate results lean heavily upon die efficiency and directness with which assistance and training can be pro - vided, adequate equipment furnished, and, last but not least, the general morale of the restored individuals raised. ■ •; ■■■■..-.' . ■ iv . . ; :■■ . ■ Activities of State Supervisor (A) Out-of-State Conferences (1) The state supervisor of nursery schools has attended diree out - of-state conferences or institutes during her encumbrance in office. The meeting at Denver, Colorado, on August 1-8, 1934, was to orient rather than train the supervisors of the emergency educational programs who were in attendance from various states. Because the needs, educational systems, and the emergency educational programs themselves varied so widely, the topics discussed related to diose general matters of relationship and work which concerned all programs and of which all supervisors should have had some understanding. Dr. L. R. Alderman, director of the Educational Division of the FERA, attended diis institute for a part of the time. Workers prominent in the various fields of adult, vocational, and nursery school education took part in die program. Henry M. Busch, pro - fessor of adult education at Cleveland College, Western Reserve University, was leader of die adult educational discussions. Workers' education was represented by Miss Ernestine Friedmann, Federal specialist. Nursery school education was directed by local workers, no Federal representative attending. (2) The program for the three-day institute held in Ames, Iowa, on August 29-30-31, 1934, for nursery school supervisors of Wisconsin, Michi - gan, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri, was definitely planned </seg>
            <seg id="p262">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT for nursery school workers. East state mentioned was represented by the state supervisor of nursery school education as well as other members of the emergency educational program. The main objectives in the discussions were: (a) to re-state the practices, principles and philosophy of nursery education, (b) to determine how the outstanding objectives in each could be reached, (c) to discuss parent education from a lay-leadership point of view, and finally, (d) to arrive at some definite, possible, and practical policies which might be used as a basis to develop standards in the emergency nursery schools. This conference offered helpful and specific suggestions, gave a bird's - eye view of what other states were planning to do, but emphasized more than ever that each state was separate and distinct from the other and each had its own advantages and difficulties which, when met in the practical working out of the Federal policies, resulted in a state policy quit: different from an - other in the same region. (3) The next out-of-state conference attended was the National Parent Education Council conference at Washington, D. C, on October 31-Novem - ber 4. This conference was held in collaboration with the biennial meeting of the National Council of Parent Education. Because of the national im - portance attached to the proper organization of emergency nursery schools this council had, in the early days of planning, taken a very aggressive part in determining and guiding the work. Bulletins, bibliographies, and teaching aids were prepared and sent to each state for its guidance and help in the initial steps. At its insistence, trained leadership for nursery school and parent education was provided. It was, therefore, thought advisable that supervisors of nursery schools of the various state departments of emergency education should be invited to attend this conference, at the expense of the council, and receive the benefits which such an august body might give, as well as take part in a special training program arranged for emergency educa - tion supervisors. As die National Council of Parent Education embraces representatives from all organizations whose special work is any phase of child welfare, this meeting was of outstanding importance. The intensive training program which took four hours each day of the conference was but a third of all the other meetings, lectures, and committees imposed upon the delegates besides luncheons and banquets at which prominent and nationally known authorities on various subjects spoke. ■ This conference will long be remembered by sea - soned workers as well as by novices as the outstanding, high-powered gather - ing of its type of the depression years. (B) State Conferences For Nursery School Teachers and Workers in Nebraska (1) A conference consisting of one member from each of the nursery schools in operation was held in Lincoln October 8-13, 1934, inclusive. Nur - sery schools had been so quickly put in operation in the fall that there had </seg>
            <seg id="p263">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION been little opportunity for a general meeting of the teachers before their work began, so it was thought advisable to bring together such members as could be spared from their duties in the various nursery schools for a general meeting. The plan was practically the same as that followed in a previous training course several months before. It consisted of especially conducted discussions, organized observations in the Child Development Laboratory of the University of Nebraska, and an emergency nursery school at Saratoga school, and informal visiting and getting acquainted with the work and with each other. Miss Clara Wilson, Dr. Ruth Staples, Dr. Clara Wilson, and Mrs. Anderson of the University faculty generously gave their time to leading discussions and directing laboratory demonstrations. The state supervisor acted as general chairman and led the round table discussions on Parent Edu - cation during the latter days of the conference. Representatives from each of the nursery schools then operating attended' the full week of the conference. Definite results from the meeting were seen Mutual problems and difficultis were found, and as soon as they were dis closed to the state supervisor they were informally discussed and solved a; far as was possible. This added an impetus to repeat the conference for othei workers in the future. (2) During the Christmas vacation when schools were temporarily dosed, nil the nursery school workers of the various units in the state undertook a toy-making and repairing project. Patterns, blue prints, and descriptions of suitable toys, previously prepared by the state supervisor, were made avail - rble to each unit and at the end of the vacation period 218 different pieces of toy and play equipment, besides the intangible results of learning and working together, were ready for the new year. A period of this sort was found to be of great benefit to the unit. Playthings which at the time could not be furnished were later completed and a general habit of making new toys ,md keeping old ones in repair was built up. It is to be regretted that there has not been sufficient time, energy and funds to publish a bulletin containing blue prints and descriptions of the toys and play equipment the nursery school workers of Nebraska made during their "off hours." Many of them were originally developed and could with the help of good designs be made into profitable toys for the trade. There was an effort made, however, to duplicate such of the small toys and play - things as could be inexpensively done, for the purpose of establishing a per - manent loan exhibit. About a dozen articles with patterns and instructions for making have been sent outside the state, notably to Homestead, West Virginia (Mrs. Roosevelt's project), as well as to all the nursery schools in the state. This loan exhibit was later augmented by clothing for children. Inexpensive sunsuits that fitted properly and under wear which permitted self-help were given special attention, besides the little dresses and suits commonly worn by young children. (3) After these Christmas vacation work meetings, numerous work meetings continuing for a day or two were held in various parts of the state, </seg>
            <seg id="p264">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT notably in Omaha, Nebraska City, Cambridge, Kearney and Lincoln. And as emergencies arose, certain workers from various units came to Lincoln for a period of training and conference with the supervisor, continuing from sev - eral days to a week in some instances. (4) A training program planned definitely to train new nursery school workers and such others of the present staffs as deemed advisable was planned for the month of August, 1935. Persons chosen to attend were selected from the relief rolls of various parts of the state who were known by local authori - ties to be suitable persons for nursery school work. It was originally intended to secure the services of Dr. Ruth Staples, Dr. Clara Wilson, and Miss Florence Atwood, professors at the University of Nebraska and Mrs. Hazel Schaus, a member of the Child Welfare Divi - sion of the University of Iowa, as well as a few local teachers, to help the state supervisor with the instruction and training of the group. Due to slow - ness in the mechanism for selecting the trainees, it was not possible to begin the conference until the middle of August, and by that time the persons above named were not available, two having gone to other states to assist in the same kind of training program at much better pay than Nebraska was allowed to offer. Dr. Grace Langdon, nursery school specialist from Washington, visited Lincoln on August 12 in the interests of the closing program of the FERA and the new one being inaugurated by Works Progress Administration (WPA). Two days were spent in discussing the merits of the programs and the contemplated training program. The conference finally began on August 19. It continued until Septem - ber 1. Forty-eight persons received training during the period, thirty-six of whom were of relief status, twelve non-relief. A flat rate of #20.00 per week was paid to the relief trainees; transpor - tation was included as a separate item. The twelve non-relief persons came at their own expense and received no pay for the period of training. All of them assisted the state supervisor and were instrumental in the success of the program. Superintendent M. C. Lefler of the Lincoln schools most generously offered Clinton school building, all equipment, and the services of the cus - todian for the two-week period of training. Without this plant, the hearty cooperation of the Superintendent, and the Clinton nursery school staff, the conference could not have assumed the proportions of success that it did. The initial enrollment of die trainees predicted the n^ed for instruction in the basic physical wants of little children—food, clothing and health; and die courses were planned to fit these definitely. At the same time there were twelve persons attending the courses at their own expense who were better trained and more experienced than the trainees, so provision was made </seg>
            <seg id="p265">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION to instruct them in the methods and techniques of parent education and to give them experience in teaching groups of this type under direction and super - vision of the state supervisor, who had the courses in charge. The trainees themselves could be used as demonstration classes for this second training objective. The entire conference was organized on a discussion-work basis: the first week, food and health; the second week, clothing. A study of die mimeo - graphed "Food Notes" (copy in appendix) will give an idea of the subject matter covered. Each day a nursery school dinner was prepared and served by a selected number of trainees under the supervision of the dietitian em - ployed in the Havelock nursery school. This system not only furnished prac - tical cooking experience for die trainees and free discussion of the merits of the food after it had been cooked and eaten, but solved the problem of the noonday meal for the group. Large quantity recipes were worked out for many of the important servings. Definite instructions in selection of cooking equipment were also given as well as in the processes of cookery and the buy - ing of food materials. The interest in food study and the practical results obtained through this method of teaching die group were most gratifying. The stage seemed to be set for all the psychological principles of learning to operate properly. The whole procedure was motivated and timed perfecdy and gave results that outdistanced many others in the experience of die writer. The second week was most profitably spent in the discussion of inexpen - sive and adequate clothing for little children. A study of a large number of garments furnished by die modiers of the nursery school children showed a definite lack of comfort and self-help efficiency in children's undergarments either purchased or made. Consequently the first part of the week was given over to an analysis of die problem and eventually to die construction of garments out of made-over materials that were adequate, practical, and which any mother with the simplest instruction could make. (One can see how die thread of parent education was woven into the teaching as well as instruction in subject matter.) The latter part of die second week was given over to the study of a necessary clothing budget for children and finally assembling a minimum wardrobe, after all the essentials had been discussed, from the actual clothing worn by the children of die nursery school. This plan of assembling an adequate wardrobe from clothes worn radier than clothes purchased helped to emphasize the fact that on a narrow income margin, providing material can be purchased intelligendy and old clothes to make over are available, making clothing for the children is a profitable activity for die housewife who knows how to sew. (If she does not, should she be taught?) (C) Extraneous Activities (1) During die Summer Session of the University of Nebraska, die state supervisor was requested to teach several of the university classes while </seg>

            <seg id="p297">... OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION (D) Reasons given for withdrawal of teachers from Program: 1. Classes discontinued during summer months because of: a. Attendance decreases due to hot weather. b. Few literacy and citizenship classes feasible in western part of the state because enrollees work long hours in beet fields, and other harvests. 2. Teacher secured full time employment in a field other than an emergency educational- (relief) project. (See NOTE) 1. Illness. 5 Teacher received fellowship or scholarship in an educational institution. 6. Teacher moved from locality of project. NOTE: In some cases the work of the teacher in an Emergency Educa - tional project has so impressed the local superintendent and board of education that he or she has been added to the regular teaching staff of the local school. LICENSES, PENALTIES AND FINES Section 5, Article VII of the State Constitution provides. "All fines, penalties and license, or ("Whatever they ar called."—State vs. Aitken 61, Nebr. 490), monies, ***shall be appropriated exclusively to the use and support of the common schools in the respective subdivisions where the same may accrue." License monies, or ("Whatever they are called"), are not being so ap - propriated. They are being diverted and appropriated for other purposes. The Statute should direct all such monies collected by the State into the temporary school fund for the use and benefit of all the common schools of the State. Education —If ever there was a cause, if ever there can be a cause, worthy to be upheld by all of toil or sacrifice that the human hand or heart can endure, it is the cause of Education. It has intrinsic and indestructible merits. It holds the welfare of mankind in its embrace, as the protecting ars of a mother hold her infant to her bosom. The very ignorance and selfishness which obstruct its path are the strongest arguments for its promotion, for it furnishes the only adequate means for their removal.—From the Common School Journal, 1842. </seg>

Agricultural Education A complete program of Agricultural Educaticn as conducted by the Vocational Agricultural department of a high school is not confined to work with high school students alone. Part-time classes for farm boys not regularly enrolled in school and Adult classes in Agriculture for active farmers of the community, are important phases of die program. (a) High School Agricultural Departments High School courses in Vocational Agriculture are de - signed for the training of boys preparing for die vocation of farming. The boys learn by doing, through direc: participation in die activities of the classroom, laboratory, shop, barnyard, farmhome and field. The old approved and well established farming procedures, supplemented by the newer scientific methods in croo-production, animal - husbandry, farm-mechanics and genera! farm-management are studied and put into practice by the future farmeri enrolled.

Thev offer suitable schooling to die large group of boys between the ages of 14 and 25 who are not regularly enrolled in high school, many of whom have dropped out because the courses did not seem to meet their needs. In the part-time school these boys may receive instruction in agriculture and related subjects during die farmer's "slack season." The. work is largely concerned with "doing diings" rather than book study. Laboratory and shop-work constitute a large part of die course. The part-time school may so interest many boys that they will return to complete the high school course for gradu - ation: A recent survey indicates that there is a surprisingly large number of out-of-school young men on the farms of every community, to whom such courses appeal as being practi - cal and very much worth while. </seg>

Methods of farming are changing constantly with die developments in machinery, discovery of new facts and the consumer's demands and standards of living. Progress depends upon the rapidity with which the farmer changes his thinking and operations to meet widi the new conditions. His adjustment will be in direct proportion to new knowledge gained. The Adult class in agriculture offers an opportunity for the farmer to obtain this new knowledge. A local school maintaining a department of Vocational Agriculture may through Adull classes extend its influence and usefulness in the commun - ity. </seg>

Trade and Industrial Education (a) Adult Trade and Industrial Classes For the past several years unemployment in industry has resulted from consolidations and mergers, improvement of processes by science and reduced production. In view of these facts, the State Department has concentrated, much of its efforts on evening trade and industrial classes giving trade extension instruction in order to help adults, usually with dependents to care for, retain their positions or secure other employment where necessary. These classes are conducted in schools, shops or industrial plants with practical men and women as instructors. They are offering instruction to persons over sixteen years of age now obliged to be self-supporting and entitled to such schooling. Courses were offered in such subjects as nurses' chemistry, nurses' dietetics, nurses' psychology, nurses' anatomy and physiology, nurses' bacteriology, blue print reading, prac - tical telephony, locomotive operation, electricity, ox weld - ing, A. R. A. rules, car air, acetylene welding, electric weld - ing, public health nursing, show card writing, essentials of telephone electricity, telephone cable and exchange work, I. B. X. and P. B.

These apprentices are returned to school for a minimum of four hours per week to receive instruction which, because it takes too much of the fore - '. man's time and interferes with production, cannot be given on the job. Due to shortage of jobs during the past several years, youth has been denied opportunity to learn on the job as an apprentice. Widi conditions in industry gradually improving, the youth of die sate should be given more opportunity to secure training by part time in school and part time on the job.

            <seg id="p306">304 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT (c) Part-time General Continuation School; Under the laws of Nebraska, the board of education in any school district having fifteen or more children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen who hold employment permits which are in force must establish part-time dassei giving instruction to such permit holders for eight hours per week. When part-time classes are established permit holders are required to attend, while the classes are open upon a voluntary basis for all others between 14 and 16. At the present time, Omaha is the only city having a largi enough number of employed boys and girls to warrant or - ganizing a separate part-time school. The schedule of instruction in the part-time school is not fixed, as the pupils enrolled are of varying ages and scholastic attainment. They are employed in a variety of jobs and their experiences are those of workers rather than children. Consequently, to make the school best servi their need, it is organized on an opportunity school basis to give the pupil the things he needs and can profit b/ most.

The aim is both to prepare for advantageous entrance upor. an occupation and to assist the potential expert worker to become a thinker having a larger vision of his field of labor.

III. Home Economics Education (a) Adult Homemaking Education A vocational homemaking department has not attained its maximum service in a community unless it extends its service to the homemakers as well as to the students in die high school. It is not necessary, however, that a day school program be maintained in order to have home - making clasr.cs organized for homemakers. The majority of the classes meet in the afternoon. Many I of them meet in the morning. Only n few meet at night. They are organized in short units of six to ten lessons in any phase of homemaking where a sufficient number of persons desire the work and a teacher can be secured. The type of classes offered are listed in die following pages. As units are completed an opportunity is presented to enroll in advanced unit courses. Classes in Parent Educa - tion, Family Life, Mental Hygiene, Personality Develop - ment, Nutrition, and Care and Repair of Furniture have been organized for both men and women. Teachers are selected by local superintendents. They may be members of die focal school system, practical men and women in die community, or itinerant teachers who are specialists in one or more phases of homemaking education. Detailed information on adult homemnking education is given in Bulletin No. 26, published by die State Board for Vocational Education.

Part-time classes for rural girls may be organized to give training to the girls who must remain at home to help with the farm and house work. Schools which are equipped to teach Homemaking can offer part-time work to girls' in their own district and to tuition students at a small expense. A special teacher is needed to conduct the work. A rourse may be from. six weeks to four months in length. (c) All-Day Homemaking Departments. Homemaking training is an essential part of the general education of every girl. Courses in the day schools are at least two years in length. They are planned to give the girls training in the homemaking responsibilities they should be carrying at die present, and to lay v foundation for n continued development in homemaking interests and abiH - ties. Each year's' work includes units in. social and familv relationships; personal hygiene; food preparation on the meal basis; clothing selection, construction and care; and child care and development. The subject matter in each unit is selected and organized by die homemaking teachc - so it will be most practical for each community. Home projects are a part of each year's work. These are super - vised through home visits to cooperate with parents and through individual conferences at school. In addition to units in homemaking the course include instruction in art applied to clothing, house furnishings and decorating- problems; science related to home prob lems and physiology. </seg>

            <seg id="p311">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION production bringing about more stringent physical requirements for workers has increased its seriousness. Concurrent with the increasing use of machines and' faster pro - duction methods in industry and agriculture and with die introduc - tion of the motor vehicle and greater speed in modes of travel has come a tremendous increase in the number of those disabled by acd dents. The dependent condition of many of these people creates an economic load which Vocational Rehabilitation is designed to relieve by assisting physically handicapped persons to prepare themselves to engage in occupations whereby they may be self-supporting. During the past year, 64 handicapped persons have been fitted for and placed in occupations in which they are earning a living. These were prepared by school training, by employment training and by the provision of artificial appliances, physical restoration and care - ful re-adjustment to suitable occupations. With the aid of diis division 210 disabled persons are now pre - paring themselves to engage in new occupations. Applications from many others are pending. . ' '■■■[' '■ . .

The Strength of a Republic —Some have thought that, in a republic, the good and wise must necessarily maintain an ascendency over die vicious and ignorant. But whence any such moral necessity? The distinctive char - acteristic of a republic is the greater freedom and power of its members. A republic is a political contrivance by which the whole popular voice is collected and uttered, as one articulate and authoritative sound. If, then, the people are unrighteous, that utterance will be unrighteous. If the people, or a ma - jority of them, withdraw their eyes from wisdom and equity, —those ever - lasting lights in the firmament of truth; —if they abandon themselves to party strife, where the triumph of a faction, rather than die prevalecne of the right, is made die object of contest, —it becomes as certain as are the laws of Omni - potence, that such a community will express and obey the baser will.—From die Fourth of July Oration, Boston, 1842. "Some eulogize our system of Popular Education, as though worthy to be universally admired and imitated. Others pronounce it, circumscribed in its action, and feeble, even where it acts. Let us waste no time in composing this strife. If good, let us improve it; if bad, let us reform it. It is of human institutions, as of men, —not any one is so good diat it cannot be made better; nor so bad, diat it may not become worse." Capacity for Improvement —I hold all past achievements of the human mind to be rather in die nature of prophecy than of fulfilment; —die first - fruits of the beneficence of God, in endowing us with the faculties of percep - tion, comparison, calculation, and casuality, radier dian the full harvest of dieir eventual development.... And if we believe in our individual capacity for indefinite improvement, why should we doubt die capacity of the race for continued progress, as long as it dwells upon die eardi?—From die Twelfth Annual Report. </seg>
            <seg id="p318">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT "With human liberty at the cross-roads and free public education the only sure safeguard oF democracy, we need to turn again to the ideals of the men who founded our country. Looked at in this light, the life of Horace Mann assumes a new importance in the annals of American democracy and achievement. From him as from Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln, we learn the true meaning of our national existence. From him we learn anew the central importance of personal character and the necessity of paying greater attenion to the general welfare." "Seven strategic points in the winning of die war against ignorance in America by Hlwood P. Cubberley." (1) The battle for tax support. (2) The battle to eliminate die pauper-school idea. (3) The battle to make die schools entirely free. (4) The batde to establish state supervision. (5) The battle to eliminate sectarianism. (6) The batde to extend die system upward. (7) Addition of die state university to crown die system. "In 1837 when Horace Mann came to die secretaryship of the Massa - chusetts newly-created Board of Education, a financial panic dominated the nation. Fear, greed, and confusion were everywhere. Unemployment, misery, and distress prevailed. Schools were poor, teachers unprepared and under - paid. The well-to-do were sending dieir sons and daughters to private schools. They felt little or no concern for the public schools which they thought only good enough for paupers. In such a time people needed es - pecially to place a higher value upon themselves—to attach more importance to die homely virtues and to diinking as a way of life. In 1837 the time had come for an educational revival." The Common School —The Common School is the greatest discovery ever made by man. In two grand, characteristic attributes, it is supereminent over all odiers; —first, in its universality;—for it is capacious enough to re - ceive and cherish in its parental bosom every child diat comes into die world; and second, in die timeliness of die aid it proffers;—its early, seasonable sup - plies of counsel and guidance making security antedate danger. Other social organizations are curative and remedial; this is a preventive and an antedote; they come to heal diseases and wounds; this, to make die physical and moral frame invulnerable to diem. Let die common school be expanded to its capabilities, let it be worked with die efficiency of which it is susceptible, and nine-tendis of die crimes in the penal code will become obsolete; the long catalogue of human ills will be abridged; men will walk more safely by day; every pillow will be more inviolable by night; property, life, and char - acter will be held by a stronger tenure; all rational hopes respecting die future brightened.—From die Common School Journal, 1841. </seg>
