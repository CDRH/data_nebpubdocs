NEBRASKA IN THE I'NITED 8TATE8 SENATE 

PRELIMINARY HISTORICAL SKETCH. 

The territory of NebfMka was organized by act of congress 

May :!0, 1854. 

January 11, 1860, Nebraska passed an act to submit the queslion 
of calling a state constitutional convent ion wliiili was defeated 
at an election March 5, 1860. 

April 19, 1864, congress passed an act to enable Nebraska to 
submit a constitution to a vote of the people, with reference to 
admission as a state of the Union, and the legislature framed 
and submitted such an instrument, which was adopted at an 

¦lection June 2. I860. Thereupon a bill for her admission passed 
ongress July 27, 1866, which was held by President Johnson and 

neither signed nor returned during the session. January 16. 
1867, another bill passed and was vetoed by the president and 
passed over his veto on the 9th day of February, 1867. 

the state constitution thus placed before congress provided 
the exercise of suffrage by white male citizens only, but 
since emancipation had taken place and the 15th amendment 
was in process of adoption, an injunction was placed upon us. 
requiring that befora*admission the state legislature should 
agree, in behalf of the people, "that there shall be no denial of 
the elective franchise to any person, by reason of race or color," 
in the State of Nebraska. To secure this pledge, Governor 
Saunders convened the territorial legislature on the 20th day 
of February, 1867, when the fundamental condition was 
adopted, and President Johnson issued a proclamation March 
1, 1867, declaring Nebraska a state in the Union. 

There being but four days of the second session of the thirty- </seg>

in Biblical quotations, and amidst the clinking of gtai 

the festive iaspircr. Hut as my intention is not to furnish a 
biography of the senate. I must pass over many of the fifty four 
senators, equally worthy of mention, for during the war the 
staiis were admonished to plaee only on guard "the tried and 
the true." 

Never was a body of men better acquainted with a system of 
legislation, for under their scrutiny and moulding influences the 
legal superstructure had arisen. 

The war just ended had demanded a new currency and a system 
of revenue, and "war legislation" and constitutional modifications, 
and centralization of power and the fostering of the 
dominant political party by congressional enactments. Of the 
fifty-four senators seven had been elected as democrats and 
forty-seven as republicans; but of the latter many had been 
before the war democrats on the subjects of tariffs, and the 
construction of the constitution, and others had been whigs, 
agreeing with them as to the true doctrines of Btate rights. It 
was evident, therefore, that as soon as the government should 
be prepared to return to a peace basis again, unless the return 
was unanimously conceded, some republican methods would be 
repudiated and old cherished doctrines revived and made prominent. 
This defection had already commenced, and Dixon of 
Connecticut, Norton of Minnesota, and Doolittle of Wisconsin, 
were frequently joined with the opposition. 

But the most conspicuous opponent of radical republicanism, 
during the fortieth congress and subsequently, was Andrew 
Johnson, president of the United States. Mr. Johnson had T&gt;een </seg>

youth he had never gone to school, and yet he acquired a fair 
English ('duration. At seventeen years of age we find him a 
tailor by occupation; at twenty tin* Mayor of Greenville, Tenn.; 
at twenty seven in the legislature of the State, and at thirtythree 
in the State senate. He was in congress ten years, begin 
ning in 1843, and twice elected governor prior to 1857 in which 
year he was elected to the United States senate. 

Amidst the fury of the rebellion he left the senate to become 
military governor of his state, and received the nomination for 
vice president in 1804. Mr. Lincoln had been assassinated April 
14. 1805, and Mr. Johnson sworn into office on the 15th of the 

same month, only six days from tho date of General Lee's sur 
render to General Grant. 

t»n the Htfc of May. 1866, the last army of the confederacy 
having surrendered, and CMfmi nut being in session. Mr. 
Johnson began the work of reconstructing the rebel states, 
cording to what was known as ihisi "My Policy"; and which 
gave ex -rebels an opportunity of ion I rolling completely the 
legal white element and freemen. Congress claimed the power 
•tot the whole territory subdued by war. and stood ready \&lt;&lt; 
comply with the 4th article of the constitution which declares 
that "The Inited States shall guarantee to every state in this 
I'nion a republican form of government." 

When, therefore that bodv assembled in the next se^ 

the struggle began in earnest between the president aud congress. 
On the second of March. lst&gt;7. an act was passed for 
the "reorganization of civil government in the ten rebel stai 
and another to "govern the tenure of civil office." 7 both of which 
were promptly vetoed by the president, and as promptly passed 
over the veto. Thus stood the question on the day of our admission 
to the senate. 

As General Thayer had made an honorable record in the army 
aud had experience in Indian affairs, it was very proper that he 
should be assigned to duty on the military and Indian affairs 
committees, while he also secured an assignment to that of </seg>

or iu approving the manipulating strategy of the episcopacy in 

So&lt;m. therefore, when called on to explain the mode of ad 
ministration over his charge, and requested to be silent on the 
ciirreni topic of the times, his answer to the former question 
was: "My official members do as they please and I sustain them, 
and I do as I please and they sustain me." And to the latter 
•I could not promise that to my father in his shroud." To a 
t— gWgatioM he said: "While I occupy this desk you will have a 
free preacher, and all my words shall be free speech, and when 
you can no longer endure it. you may install a slave in my stead. 
and substitute for the Bible the Books of Mormon or Koran- of 

Mohammed." 

While between him and his people there was the most perfect 
ai ¦ ord. he deemed it prudent to decline orders, and rec|iiest.-.l 
the Conference to make up the record. "Disiont inued at his 
own request." and at once adopted the democracy of the Cmi 
l: relational church government. 

&lt; oming to Nebraska in is.~)8. and elected president of Brown 
viMe College, an institution on paper, he organized a Conp 
lional society of sixteen members, out of new and old school 
Presbyterians. Baptists, Methodists and Congregational ists. 
which was dissolved by mutual consent when the war of ISM 4 
unsettled residences on the border. Eligible to a chaplaincy, he 
entered the 1st Nebraska Infantry in 1861 and was mustered out 
of Veteran Cavalry in 1865, and on the same day was appointed 
United States Assessor of Internal Revenue by President 

Johnson. 

Euring the war he was often in charge of subsistence and 
isportation for loyal refugees within the Union lines, and of 
lications for military emancipation of slaves. 

&lt;&gt;n the 13th of February, 1864. at Batesville. Arkansas. Mr.

Lincoln.

and on the same day commissioned by President Johnson as 
Assessor of Internal Revenue for Nebraska. He championed 
the cause of immediate state organization in the political campaigns 
that followed, and when the state constitution wat&gt; 
adopted and the legislature met in special session on July 4. 
1866, he and Gen. John M. Thayer were made the nominees of 
the republican party for the two Halted States senatorships. 
The journal of the joint session hold on July 11, 186&lt;», shows 
that a motion to proceed to election of V. S. senator for South 
Platte having carried, the first ballot resulted: T. W. Tipton. _"• 
votes; J. Sterling Morton, 21 votes. A motion prevailing to 
proceed to election of U. S. senator for North Platte. the first 

ballot resulted: John M. Thayer, Sf votes; Andrew J. Poppleton. 
21 votes. So Nebraska came into the T'ifion with two republican 
United States senators. 

PEABODY MEDAL. 

On the second day of the senate session, the following March, 
before the organization of the senate was completed, Mr. Sum 
ner presented resolution No. 1. "Tendering the thanks of congress 
to George Peabody, with a gold medal, for having donated 
large sums of money to states and corporations for educational 
purposes." During the day he called it up and asked its immediate 
passage, which was objected to because it had not been to 
a committee, and there was no evidence before the senate on 
which the case was founded. 

On the fourth day of the session Mr. Sumner delivered a 
speech, highly eulogistic of the donor, who had been in Maanchusetts, 
lived in Baltimore and made most of his immense 
fortune by banking in London. In this he was followed by 
Johnson of Maryland, one of the ablest democrats of the nation. 

Mr. Tipton was well aware that an opinion obtained, that a 
new senator should "sit at the feet of Gamaliel" during a probation 
and not dare to dissent from the great leaders on the ordinary 
&lt;]iiestions; hut in the case before the body he_saw plainly

Mr. Tittox: I have this to say: that the more this ques 
tion is discussed the more I feel an interest in it, and th. 
senator from Indiana (Mr. Hendrieks) spoke the democratic 
truth when he said that such a rule as that now pro 
|)oscd. so subversive of the principles of democracy, woulc 
have kept a recent state out of the Union. That is true 
You have never required it of the people of a territory 
I represent a people who were permitted to come here, in 

hey could show a majority in favor of a state organi/ation. 
and I will not therefore under any circumstances 
r;ist a vote by which some other constituency shall not 

conn- here by a single one of a majority. This is my dem 
racj on a question of this kind. 

The &lt;-i inclusion of his remarks was as follows: 

Sir. we went to a loyal minorit\- when we went with our 
arms in our hands to release them; and I propose to go to 
tlmt loyal minority now, and a majority perhaps that would 
be willing- to five as good attention to the poor remarks I 
should make as many of the senators here just at this pretest 
speaking. 

1 !jo to that loyal minority, and I say a majority of them, 
so help me God, shall control the destiny of the south, ant 
the destiny of the rebels of the south. For four years wt 
have done without the representatives of disloyalty in this 
chamber; for four years more we can do without the dis 
loyal in organizing states at the south; and loyal white men 
and loyal black men will come to our aid in this matter. 

1 am not willing that the disloyal, by any classification 
or any mathematical calculation, shall be permitted to stay 
at home and assist in defeating the loyal men of the north. 
This may be called spurious morality and philanthropy. I 
would suggest for the benefit of the senator from the state 
of New York (Mr. Conkling) that when he goes on a peddling 
mission with his "fine-toothed combs" he may find as 
much necessity for them in the purlieus of the city of New 
York as in the humblest freedman's cabin in the whole 
state of South Carolina.

president 011 the question of reconstruction of the states lat« - lv 
in rebellion. At that time an Indian war was desolating western 
Kansas and Nebraska, and a portion of the senators had 
as much denunciation for our frontier settlers as for the murderous 
savages. But others than senators from the West a&lt;l 
niitted the importance of the crisis. Still there was an indisposition 
to act in our behalf, and a resolution was passed in 

(aliens and offered in open senate to exclude action on all sul&gt; 
j&lt;-(is at that session, excepting reconstruction. The oinnipo 
time of the caucus was asserted by one senator as follows: No 

senator can l&gt;e mperior to the decrees of caucus," and it 


charged that men of honor must abide its decisions. To this 

replied Mr. Tipton 

Before tin- vote is taken.

or from Maine 1— ertl, as 

at whatever e\]&gt;ense to myself 
, I have a word to say. II 
I understand, that he is warned 
with men who differ in reimnl 
question of this kind. I was a 

in regard to future action: 
1&lt;| «hnt is honorable on a 

member of that caucus. When my colleague in that caucus 
siiiriristed that if we passed the resolution we mijrht be 

precluded! pOMibly, from doing something, if an oppor 
tunity should offer, in behalf of our suffering frontier citi 

/ens and those of Kansas, I, taking that view of the que 
tion. from that moment voted against the resolution. 

After voting against it in the caucus. I came into that 
e. The senator from Kansas notifies the senate by a 
proclamation from the governor that the glorious little 
.state calls upon her citizens, who cannot give ample protection 
to her own citizens, to go and help the government 
protect the I'nited States property — the Union Pacific Railroad. 
Seeing the conditions of things there in a more precarious 
light than I did see them day before yesterday in 
the caucuses, I felt that under these circumstances I would 
not be true to my constituents and my state were I to allow 
the behests of any body, any organization, to cause me 
now to step aside from Kansas and her troubles, and Nebraska 
and her troubles, and say we will not entertain ¦ 
proposition in your behalf. I should not be a man of honor 
if I permitted myself to act thus, and I say no senator here 
could claim that he acted honorably if he had gone back 
upon his constituency under these circumstances. I am 
yery free to hear from any senator that he disapproves of</seg>

The result in congress was a commission ordered 
to attempt a treaty. 

In the fwegatag and a few other casual utterances counter to 
popular prejudice, and discarding mere conciliatory policy, aj&gt; 
l»eared the senator from Nebraska, ujmmi the skirmish line of 
parliamentary discussion, at the end of the first session of the 
4l&gt;th Congress. 

This session was the most peculiar of any that had ever pre¦ 
¦edcd it. inasmuch as it kept in perpetual session, by an adjourn 
ment from time to time. Meeting on March 4th, 1*07, and on the 
:'.(tth of the same month adjourning until the :trd of .July and on 
the L'Oth of July adjourning to the Hist of November and con 
tinning to Dtwhtr I'nd, Wing the tirst day of the second 
session. The object being that no harm should come to the re 
public during a recess, from aggressive acts of President John 

son. 

PBHIIDRXT Johnson's MODI or kkconstimction. 

The basis on which he attempted to reorganize the rebel states 
provided that the persons taking part therein should have taken 
an oath of allegiance to the United States, according to his 
amnesty proclamation, and were qualified as voters according to 
the laws of the state before secession. And the convention or 
legislature should have power to "prescribe qualifications of 
electors and the eligibility of persons to hold office." 

This left it possible for the rebels then in power to perpetuate 
themselves in office, through the formality of a convention and a 
new election, unless they were ruled out by the 14th amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States. Once in power again, 
the Freedmen were at their mercy, as to the elective franchise. 
As a result of this mode of reconstruction, senators and representatives 
tor Congress were mostly taken from a class of men 
who had held office under the Confederacy; from those also who 
had abandoned seats in the Congress of the United States to levy

Persons of that class rould not take the test oath, and hence 
Mali not have been admitted at Washinjrton. even if the i-it.hi 
structed states were approved. Having appointed governors at 
his pleasure, and settled the amounts of their salaries, and having 
declared peace and recognized states, he went so far as to 
assign Agricultural College scrip to North Carolina, assuming 
functions belonging to Congress. And vet the President had 
held very different views on rebels coining to the front in reconstruction. 
At Nashville. Tennessee. .June !t. 1S«4. he said: 

I say that traitors should take a back seat in the work 
of reconstruction. If there be but ."&gt;.(XKI men in Tennessee 
loyal to the constitution, these true and faithful men shoult 
control the work of reorganization and reformation, exclu 
sively. If a state is to be nursed until it again gets strength 
it must l&gt;e nursed by its friends, and not smothered by its 
enemies. 

RSo marked had been his radicalism, fears were entertained, on 
b accession to power, that he would be impracticably wwrr, 
and being from the south, the men lately in arms had much to 
fear; but when he began to champion a course so much more to 
their taste than the plan of Congress, their spirits revived. 

KKBEL CONFESSION 

KOn this question Senator Tipton used the following language 
a speech delivered in Congress in February. 18B8: 

I do not wish to be uncharitable, and am therefore in 
dined to pause just here, and dwell upon the fact that 
if left alone, the penitent rebel and the unrepentan 
would neither of them be asking or desiring to-day th 
privilege of voting. On the day of surrender they woul« 
have said: "We entered the war against you, determined t 
destroy the American Union; we hated the idea of nation 
ality: we cherished the fancy of state sovereignty; w 
adored the institution of slavery as a system of power am 
wealth, a concomitant of aristocracy, and the proper corner 
stone of civil government. The appeal of our Revolutionar 
fathers in behalf of universal freedom were all discarded

impression obtained that the army was to be used to oust Stanton 
and defy congress during the time intervening between the 
above dates and the ttOth of March following. An order for the

BTUMP SPEECHES. 

riroof of article 1(1. ehwgtag an attempt to bring eoagKM 
disgrace, ridicule, liatred and contempt." reference MM 
made to a speech at tlie Wliite House, on a MmtimgmUkei «?&lt;•• 
cation, as follows: "We have seen hanging on the verge of the 
government, as it were, a body called or which assumes to be 
the congress of the I'nited States, while, in fact, it is a eeagtCM 
of only part of the states." The second specification charged the 
&lt;lelivery of certain "intemi&gt;erate. inflammatory and scandalous 
harangues" at Cleveland. &lt;&gt;.. from which we extract the follow 
ing: "But I tell you what I said. I called upon our congress that 
is trying to break up the government — [a voice. 'Von lie." and 
cheers]. Not so. [Hisses.] 'I&gt;on't get mad. Andy." Who is he? 
What language does he sj&gt;eak? What religion does he profBM 
that he can come and place his finger upon one pledge 1 ever 
x iolated. or one principle 1 ever proved false to? [Voice. 'New 
Orleans.'] 'Why don't yon hang Jeff Davis?" [Shouts and cries 
of 'Down with him."] Hang Jeff Davis? [Voice. 'Hang Wendell 
Phillips.'] Why don't you hang him? ['(Jive us an opportunity.'] 
Haven't you got the court? Haven"t you got the at 
torney general? Who is your Chief Justice who has refused to 
sit on his trial? [GrwUM and cheers.] I am not the Chief 
Justice: I am no jury. ['Iton't get mad.'] I am not mad. 
| Hisses]." 

This bandying of epithets — this throwing of mud with an infu 
riated drunken mob. just after he had been received by the peopie 
in civic processions and with all the honors a great city mmM 
bestow, and while a magnificent banquet was being prepared, 
was certainly the most humiliating exhibition of a chief niagis 
trate ever made before the American |&gt;eople. From its great 
length, it seemed an effort to overcome the rabble, and HUnrj 
away the honors of billingsgate. Specification :*. set forth the 
speech at St. Louis, on a grand reception to himself and cabinet, 
and was a counterpart of the affair at Cleveland. The running 
flre continued from the second sentence to the end of the out- </seg>

that! Kick them out! (Jo it, Andy!" To the charge of traitor he 
exclaimed: "Judas. Judas Iscariot, Judas! There was a Judas 
once, one of the twelve apostles. O. pea, and these twelve apos 
ties had a Christ, and he never could have had a Judas unless he 
had had twelve apostles. If I have played the Judas, who ha* 
been my Christ that I have played the Judas with? Was it Tliad. 
Stevens? Was it Wendell Phillips? Was it Charles Sumner? 
[Hisses and cheers.] These are the men that set up and com 
pare themselves with the Savior of men. and everybody that 
differs with them in opinion, and to try to stay and arrest their 
diabolical and nefarious pafiey is to l&gt;e denounced as Juilas. 
[•Hurrah for Andy' and cheers.]" 

On this occasion of speechmaking the president aud cabinet 
had been attending the ceremonies on laying the cornerstone 
of a monument to Stephen A. Douglas in the state of Illinois. 

t After able arguments, the vote of the senate was taken on the 
tli, -d and ."5d articles, which showed thirty-five senators for 
impeachment and nineteen in the negative. But as the aftirma 
five failed to register thirty-six, or two-thirds of all, the other 
eight articles were abandoned, and the result declared in tinnegative. 
The senators from Nebraska, believing the president 
had no right to assume the duty of the supreme court and declare 
a law unconstitutional, voted for impeachment. 

The occasion being one of such solemn iin|x&gt;rt the distinguished 
attorneys but seldom indulged in pleasantry or sarcasm. Hut on 
one occasion when Mr. Stanberry put a question in a particular 
way (reneral Batter said: ••Sometimes this rule has been relaxed 
in favor of very young counsel [laughter], who did not know 
what a leading question was, not otherwise. 1 have seen very 
young men make mistakes by accident, and I have known the 
courts to let them up and say, 'We will not hold the rule, if you 
made an accident.' " 

To which Stan l&gt;eri-\ retorted* "The i/entleniflTi suivh I -mi -m

Old Bailey court for the purpose of making factious opposition. 
I Mom am sncli imputation." 

The oulv fanciful passage of words took place between Man 
ager Boatwell and Mr. Kvarts in their tinal speeches. Mr. Boal 
well said: "Travelers ami astronomers inform us that in th. 

southern heavens, near the southern cross, there is a vast space 
¦rhick the uneducated call the hole in the sky, where the eye of 
man with the aid of the powers of the telescope lias bees usable

It should be remembered in this connection, that it is a

The rt-ino\:il of Mr. Stanton. against law. would be a "high

senate, with having issued :i letter of authority to Lorenz 
Thomas, authorizing him and commanding liim to assum 
and exercise the functions of Secretary of the Departmcn 
of War. without the advice and consent of the senate, whic 
is charged to have been in violation of the express lette 
of the constitution and of the act of March t, 1867. If th 
president, during a session of the senate, can remove on 
officer and appoint ml interim, so he may remove any or al 
and thus usurp departments and offices, while the people 
seek in vain for the restraining and supervising power of a 
prostrate and insulted tribunal. 

Believing that the stability of government depends upon 
the faithful enforcement of law. and the laws of a Republi 
being «t transcript of the people's will, and always repeal 
able by their instructions or change of public servants, 
would demand their enforcement by the president, inde 
pendent of any opinion of his relative to necessity, propriety 
or constitutionality. 

I'ltOHATlON KNI»KI&gt;. 

Inasmuch an Nebraska had been admitted a* a state of the 
T'nion after ewaptytag with a "condition precedent." Mr. Tipton 
felt no hesitancy in demanding as much from each of the reconstructed 
states. Rut as soon as a compliance was obtained, 
he protested against any further probation, while some senators 
seemed to look after new sources of delay and party advantage. 
In the matter of the claim of Mr. Sawyer, of South 
Carolina, for admission to the senate he said: 

In all my meditations on the subject 1 fancied, years ago. 
during the progress of the war. that it would be enough </seg>

zen of the Cnited States. the return of senators from states 
so recently in rebellion. 

I supposed their return would invoke a degTee of enthusiasm 
and ardor. mi extending of hands and opening of hearts, 
and an utterance on our part that would show that the 
consummation was one which was worthy to have received 
a treasure of money and a treasure of love. And now we 
stand here and higgle when South Carolina, the first to 
leave us, and one of the last to return, presents herself, 
and we ask for precedents, forsooth. I believe that the 
senator who presents himself here for admission is as loyal 
as I am, and I think I am loyal enough for all practical 
purposes. 1 stand here, therefore, heartily, freely and 
devotedly to welcome this additional representative from 
South Carolina. 

V1KOINIA. 

Per the state of Virginia had adopted a constitution in 
compliance with the act of congress, and for that pur 
and an effort was made to send her back for new pledges, 
Mr. Tipton vindicated her in a speech, claiming that she had 
done all that was required of her; and specified the adoption 
of the 13th amendment, which abolished slavery; and the 14th, 
which established citizenship, and excluded from future repiv(¦natives 
in Congress such as resigned to go into the rebelin 
and made payment of rebel debts or claims for slave propty 
impossible, and declared the public debt of the I'nited 
ates should never be questioned. He gave her further credit 
tat, "so far as Virginia is concerned, she has done her part 
the adoption of the loth amendment also." conceding impar 
il suffrage.

February 11th. 1*70., the contest was bitter in the case of

illow then to hold two years more without a reelection. 

P'oititied with the constitution of the State, the laws and 
mala of her Icgialatwr, the messages of her governor, the 
hisioiy of her judiciary and of her financial department. Mr. 
Tiptoe entered into the discussion utterly regardless of the political 
bearing of the question. 

to the numerous arguments offered in behalf of new terau

made that the Kith amendment to the I'nited Stati-s was

political millenitini. but the thoughtful one could discover a 
dark night and a rough sea. To bring back the national |

Herculean task. 

FINAL RESULTS. 

Senators were divided upon numerous questions mow vital i. 
which during war could be ignored as only side issues. Tinadvocates 
of centralization of power were reinforced by twenty 
new associates from the reconstructed states. LeaderB who 
had heretofore conceded much to liberal republicans, could 
now defy them, while the small band of reformers found their

and that bribe* were received, as a matter of custom, by

other institutions as are organized or chartered by the

that there is no necessity in the first place for any na-

In regard to the hotels, it is the same; and every one of 
the citizens of Nebraska who is injured by a deprivation of 
rights on the part of the railroad*, on the part of any common 
carriers, or on the part of the hotel keepers of the 

State, has an action for damage*, and the courts are open, 
ready to award all that may have been suffered in damages. 

So far as our theatre* are &lt; erned, we have never come 
to the conclusion yet that if our theatres should establish 
rules and regulation by which one portion of our community 
should lie excluded and another portion admitted.it was 
possible to ascertain by any standard of damages we had 
ever set up just how far a freeborn American citizen should

We never have come to the conclusion yet that it was necssary 
that the national government should legislate in re- 

trard to who should be admitted to the communion of our 
churches, or what should be the rule of exclusion there.

congress was the only power that coald establish salaries, the 
question of when an act should take effect was one for their 
own discretion, and in this ease they followed universal pre-

the democratic party were attacking the republican- 

travagance and a portion: of the republican press wai 
economy and hence they vied with each other in denouncing 
the new law as a "salary grab."' Some senators who had 
always received their nay in this manner before became su.l 
denly virtuous and turned The "back pay" into the treasury.

On the 12th day of January 

1875, one and a half months (»• 

fore the expiration of his term, in tin- IN eoagre— , the omnipresent 
Louisiana cast- was beffe the senate. Senator Howe, 
of Wisconsin, had the floor, and was to be followed by Mr. 
Tipton, and he to be succeeded by Ouwil Logan, of Illinois 
But inasmuch as some of the General's constituents were in 
the city and desired to hear him, Mr. Tipton yielded to hiquesi 
and gave liini the right of way. especially as he promised 
to give the Nebraska senator ''something to stir him up and to 
answer" 

Eor two days the general ranged the field of discussion and, 
Olympian Jove, commingling earth and heaven, dealt out 
eulogies upon friends and defiance and political death to all 
opposers. Mr. Howe closed his speech by comparing the Be 
publican party to a sailing vessel. — "If the ship goes down before 
the voyage is ended. I propose to go down with it." The 
peroration of the general was in the same strain, while his 
inspired vision was cheered by the motto flaming from her 
side, — "Freighted with the hopes of mankind.'' Following 
such a display of oratorical pyrotechnics, Mr. Tipton essayed 
to satisfy the general that he had succeeded in "stirring him 
up," and inasmuch as the Nebraska senator had previously 
spoken upon the Louisiana case in all its bearings, he was de-

EMr. President, the honorabl 
en very much excited becaust 

Senator from Illinois has 
omebody Im^ talked about 

the oppression of the republican party. Very well: he only 
can speak. I suppose, for the body that he is connected with 

in this chamber. Two years ago he gave you his opinion of 
the tyranny of the republican party in the Senate, and if he 
had been connected with the army he might have discussed 
the character of army officers; if he had been connected 
with office-holders outside he might learnedly have dis! 
their characters. But he was intimate with the Senate 
and he knew that the Senate stood here the art-at cor- 

recting instrumentality of the republican party of the countrv, 
and lie turned his attention to the Senate; and I will 
give the country the benefit to-day of his deliberate opinion 
on the subject of what the republican party was just 
two years ago. The honorable Senator then said in a speech 
in this chamber: "By calling your little meetings and seeking 
to direct everybody no man can be an independent man 
in this Senate." I think his course in this debate has illustrated 
his opinion of it two years ago. "No man." said he 
then, "can be an independent man in this Senate."

Here a vast amount of official testimony was produced showing 
that the same policy of coercion was invoked again at 
Louisiana which was attempted against Georgia, Mississippi

•They put the state of Louisiana under the foot of a Federal

them, how long would you expect them to remain under the 
foot of a Federal judge? The time came; the army of the 
Vnited States was withdrawn and a glorious revolution took 
place which shall make the names of the actors immortal in 
all time to come. All as one man rose up; they struck for 
the rights of a State under the foot of a Federal judge. 
Thank Heaven, not long. They rose in their might, and had 
the honorable Senator himself been governor of Lousiana lie 
too would have lieen in ignominious flight under the protection 
of Hrot her-in-!aw Casey in the custom-home. It was 
a people rising up who were under the foot of a Federal

to use it." He seems to have ilesired that his soldiery should 
not rust out for watit of use. and that whenever there is an 
opportunity for them to do something they should be on 
hand, that the governor should have the privilege without 
any requisition of the President, according to the constitution, 
to use the arinv. Therefore we have it understood that 
that use of the army was given upon the same old basis of

At that very time he had sent a dispatch to the

What do I propose as a remedy for these troubles? I propose 
in Louisiana that you call home your army. What 
would be the result of that? Such a state of things would 
finally come about as exists in Georgia, where white men and 
colored men all unite in sustaining Stephens unanimously 
for a seat in the House of Representatives. Call home your 
army, and the first result will be the triumph of the conservatives 
politically in Louisiana. Very well. Colored men 
for a year or two may not hold office; but the colored man 
that has been in the ricefields of Louisiana, the colored man 
who has toiled in the sugar plantations of Louisiana, will not 
be harassed by a carpet-bagging politician as their governor: 
and T mean that in no offensive sense. All those gentlemen 
who are here and who are from the South understand me in 
that. I suppose we are all carpet-baggers in this country. 
New England has carpet-bagged all the West and Northwest, 
for her population is everywhere. That is legitimate. 
Bat this offensive carpet-bagging system, the pouring out 

our political lazzaroni on their shores, is what I protest

could number and expect to live. The books were carried in 
peddlers' packs all over the State. They were read for thirteen 
nights in succession, one volume every night, at the 
miner's cabin, around the doors of the furnaces, among the 
poor impoverished laborers in the mines of Pennsylvania: 
but they saw through the flimsy disguise. They simply 
went to the polls on election day and registered their edict 
that a party that proposed to live on blood when they were 
¦Cfaety able to live for want of bread should go to political 
pandemonium: and that edict stands registered at the present 
time. 

I leave tins question with the senate. I am in favor of the 
passage of the resolution of the Senator from Missouri (Mr. 
Schurz). in order that the judiciary committee, in a cool, 
fair, manly and dispassionate manner, may look into the 
subject, and 1 trust without partisan bias be able to come 
to the conclusion that there is a government of the people 
in Louisiana in abeyance; that the duty of this government 
is to call home her army, and no longer aggravate and exasperate

SENATOR JOHN M. THAYER. 

March 4th, 1867— March 4th. 1*71. 

•John M. Thayer settled in Omaha. Nebraska, in the fall of 
1854. a few months after the territorial organization. He was 
born in Bellinghain. Norfolk County. Massachusetts. January 
24, 1820. Possessing: a good education and hopeful of the future, 
with a laudable ambition to succeed, he naturally challenged 
early attention, gained the confidence of his associates, and 
found the field of enterprise wide open for occupancy. Belonging 
to the legal profession it was not strange that visions i&gt;f 
legislative honors should have an enticing influence, and that 
in 1857, he was found a candidate for congress in a "free for 
all," before the organization of parties, in a case where four 
aspirants divided among them 5.000 votes, each receiving l.ooo. 
but Fenner Ferguson having the highest number in the hundreds. 
Again in 185!t and then in 18j&gt;0 his name was placed before 
the Republican nominating convention, but Samuel &lt;;. 
Daily, an original abolition republican, became the nominee ami 
delegate. He was elected to the territorial council of IStO-Cl, 
and subsequently to a constitutional convention. In the council 
lie was author of a bill to abolish slavery in Nebraska. In 
he entered the United States senate for a term of four 

ami in 1ST." was appointed governor of Wyoming Territory. 

enasmuch as the entire eastern front of Nebraska was tirst 
l led. bordering on the Missouri Kiver. where numerous Indian 
tribe* had originally roamed at will, the peace and qaiet, the 
km and property of emigrants were often at the mercy of 
Iff marauders. 

t» early as May. 1855, we find Gen. John M. Thayer one of a 
mission to hold a council with the Pawnee chiefs, under 

appointment of Governor Izard. 

In July of the same year the governor commissioned '

was denominated "the Pawnee war,"' the results of which were 

waring to the emigrants, and a lesson of power and authority 
to tlic Indians. An article by Major Dudley in the second volume 
of Nebraska Historical Society reports contains the following: 
"One figure, too. stands out prominently in all this 
history connected with every military affair or expedition, the 
first brigadier general of the territory, coloael of its first regiiiii-ni 
to take the field in defense of the Union: brigadier sad 
brevet major general of raited States Volunteers, and then. 
after the war, T'nited States senator, and now the recently 
elected governor of out- state. John M. Thaver." 

While it Ls neither appropriate nor intended to incorporate a 
military history of Nebraska with this brief sketch of General 
Thayer"s services, references must necessarily be made to the 
fact that he was active and persistent in the organization of the 
First Nebraska Infantry, afterward cavalry, becoming its col 
onel and leading it in inarches and skirmishes prior to its participation 
in the battle of Fort I&gt;onelson. where on the 1.1th day 
of February. 18&lt;il*. it received its first "baptism of fire." As

division at the battle of Pittabarg Landing. Tennessee, known 
also as Sliiloh. he submitted a very minute, comprehensive and 
accurate report of the participation of his command in that most 
important and sanguinary coateat. After stating the circumstances 
under which it took position in line of battle on that 
memorable Sunday night, he gave a graphic description of the 

¦teadj retreat of the Confederate line from ••."&gt; a. m. to ."&gt; \&gt;. m.." 
before the steady advance of the Union army, reinforced by 
Buell's command. He said. "I cannot speak in terms of too 
high praise of the officers and soldiers under my command. 
Their conduct was most gallant and brave throughout. They 
fought with the ardor and zeal of true patriots. It gives aw 
pleasure to speak of the different regiments and their officers. 
Nobly did the First Nebraska stisiain its reputation, well earned

Indiana and the Fifty-eighth Ohio, surgeons and officers of his 
staff, he "congratulated the general upon the part his division 
took, and upon the success which attended all his movenn-iir&gt; 
in the memorable battle of Pittshiir^ Landing." From lliis

MAIDEN SPEECH OF GENERAL, THAYER 

The duties of the military and Indian eonunittees were so 
congenial to Senator Thayer. on at t wit of a long army service 
and the deep interest his constituents had in the latter, that he 
was soon before the senate with bills, reports, and incidental 
remarks. On the 26th of .March. 1867. three weeks after his 
admission to the body, a unestion was raised by a friend of the 
California I'aeinY Railroad as to the pi-ogress of the I'nion I'a 
ciflc from Omaha westward. Thereupon General Thayer, with 
aiiuracv of statement and rullected demeanor arrested the at- 

tention of the senate. 

Mr. Thaykk: I would not trouble the senate with an 
remarks on this question except for the fact that this rou 
runs through Ike entire state which I have the honor i 
part to represent, on this floor, and in justice to the com 
pany who have had the building- of this road. I feel it m 
duty to jrivf utterance to a few words. I was surprise&lt; 
yesterday when the resolution was introduced by the honor 
able senator from California — not that he intended an 
injustice to the I'nion Pacific Railroad Company. </seg>

liiii t rom m \ knowledge 01 the facts, X &amp;m compelled tc 
¦ay that even instituting an inquiry on the subject, implying' 
that there is a neglect, does them greater injustice: for 1 
stand litre Ki say that no improvement, in ancient or modern 
times, was ever prosecuted with such untiring energy. 
uitli such tireless force, and with means such as that company 
has used. Three hundred and five miles of continuous 
road were liuilt last year, and they were only stopped be- 

cause it was beyond human energy to prosecute work this 
winter. Now, sir. this lias been the most remarkable winter 
in the west that that distinguished personage, "the oldest 
inhabitant." has had any knowledge of. There have been 
snows such as have never fallen before. They lia\e stnppec 
the progress of all works. Bui while this company have 
been stopped they have not been idle. They have been con 

centrating at the end of this three hundred miles of road 
an immense amount of material which they are now about 
to use. They have been gettin iron out there in immense 
quantities, and engines and all paraphernalia of a railroad. 
just as fast as the means of communication have enabled 
them to do." 

Eeae few remarks his colleagues discerned that the new 
• from tin- \\ cst had not lost the polish of Xew England. 
ining the duties of pioneer life. 

In a few days thereafter the recoffc show Mr. Thayer en*ged 
in an Indian war discussion, in which he had to arraign 

K report &lt;&gt;f a congressional committee, correspondents of the 
Fwt Tribune and Boston Journal, and an interview of the 
iiiiian uf the Indian committee, together with numerous 
allegations made by senators in debate. With undisputed facts, 
Kil invnlnciatilc arguments he met all coiners and charges, and 
en appealed to the sense of the senate in the following compact 
sentence 

I stand here to say to the senate, speaking in behalf o 
every class of the community on the border, speaking in 
behalf of every industrial pursuit, that nothing can be 
more abhorrent, nothing more dreaded by them than an 
Indian war. Why. sir. until these hostilities upon the fron

You will find there an humble Christianity, but it is as

rA the conclusion of a long and exhaustive speech, win n ¦ 
ator from Wisconsin offered an amendment for the removal 
all Nebraska Indians to the Indian Territory, those who 
ha\&lt;- charged Nebraska's persecution of Indians upon us. were 
astounded by the senator's concluding periods. 

They commenced within six weeks after the settlers have 
! the .Missouri lliver, and settled on lands which ha&lt; 
been ceded to the United States, to steal their cattle, am 
in the second raid killed two or three. But those days ha&gt; 
Imliiins h:i\c U'cn placed upon reserva 
tions there has l&gt;een entire peace and quiet. There is good 
feeling between the Oniahas, the Pawnees and others, even 
the Sioux, a baiul engaged in the Minnesota massacre, wh 
are now located in the northern corner of Nebraska. The. 
are on friendly terms with the whites; no collision, no 

plashing whatever. We do not ask to have those Indian 
removed. 

I tell the senator from Maine that there is a condition o 
peace and quiet l&gt;etween the people and the peaceable In 
ilians. and you may go among those tribes today and they 
will point to 'he white people, the settlers on the border, a 
their friends. Why, sir. but a few weeks ago some of them 
fearing an incursion, or a raid of the Sioux, came into 
Omaha for our protection.

At the first session of coagreM after the election of General

which had restrained 1'resident Johnson from making removals, 
and for the violation of which he was impeached. Senator 
Edmunds offered bill No. 2 to amend the same act, and Senator 
Williams an amendment for its suspension during Grant's term 
of office. In the house of representatives General Butler, of 
Massachusetts, also presented a bill for its repeal. Many old 
tots were loath to see the bill repealed, although tkei 
had supported it as only for a temporary purpose. </seg>

NEBRASKA IN" THE D. 


Some feared they might seem to be carrying favor with General 
Grant, and others that they might be supposed to have lost 
i oiifideneo in its utility. But General Thayer "slept upon his 
arms." as at Sliilob. and kept his war paint bright, and illustrated 
the maxim: "In peace, friends; enemies in war." 

tfany denied that the law refusing to allow a president to reve 
certain officers, without consent of the senate, was merely 
directed against Andrew Johnson. 

To this General Thayer replied: 

This man Johnson thought proper to abandon those who 
elevated him to power. He determined to violate, and did 
violate, all the pledges he had made. He did forswear the 
principles upon which he was elected, and joined the polit- 

ical enemies who had fought him from the commencement 
of the Rebellion. Then he undertook to sweep from power 
and place those who had sustained President Lincoln, am 
who had sustained the principles upon which Mr. Lincoln's 
administration went into power. It was then, and not til 
then, that it occurred to members of this body to originate 
the tenure of office law. No senator will rise in his place 
here and assert that he had contemplated' such a law as 
this until the treachery of Andrew Johnson was paten 
to the world. Therefore I say it was an exceptional law. 

fro the theory of suspending the law, he paid his compliments 
the most direct and positive manner. 

I say if the law is just and right as a permanent statute 
you are wrong in proposing its suspension. My honorable 
friend from Michigan (Mr. Howard) says it will be the 
highest compliment that we can pay to President Grant 
My friend from Michigan, I know, enjoys a joke. 

And then my honorable friend from New York (Mr. Conk 
ling) joined in and said it will be suspended in effect unti 
the end of the next session of congress, and that will leave 
him a year. If you mean to show confidence in Genera 
Grant, why did not the committee, why did not the friend 
of suspension, substitute the words "the 4th of March 
1873"? 

The senator from Missouri (Mr. Scburz) having denounced the 
distribution of patronage as a curse to a party, met the following 
retort:

submission to law as an evidence of the new president's prompt 
and faithful enforcement of law in the future, and closed a 
long and able speech with the following sentence:

NKBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL BOCIBTT. 

The senator from Kentucky had no word of condemnation 
for this foul, glaring, damning- treason. General Lee Is 
held up as a model of virtue and right and truth to the 
\uvith of The American Nation. This is what we witness 
here to-day. The proposition is made, and we are discussing 
the question of its reception, whether the graves of twenty 
tfcoasMd heroic dead, who died that the Xation might live, 
shall be opened, and their dust gathered up and scattered 
along the way to be deposited somewhere else, to make 

way for the widow of the traitor, whose hands were chieflj 
instrumental in taking the lives of that army of martyrs 
who sleep on the heights of Arlington. That is the spectacle 
which we now witness in the senate of the United States 
six years have passed away from the laying down o 
the arms of the rebellion. The graves of those men who 
gave their lives that we might sit here today to legislate 
for the American people, that we might sit here in com 
mon with the jieople of the Union in the enjoyment of the 
nps of the Union purchased by their blood and their 
lives are to be opened; an act of sacrilege is to be com 
mitted, in order that this property may be given back to the 
widow of Lee. Sir, as an American citizen, as a senator o 
the United States and as a soldier in the war for the Union 
1 enter my solemn protest against it. 

E»n a linal rote r&lt;&gt; jn-ant leave to introduce the resolution 
re was ilinicd. there being four in the affirmative and fiftyp 
in the negative. There was no evidence, however, that the 
three rotiag with Mr. McCreci'j approved of his resolution. 
Being ¦ inciiilici- of the military committee the Nebraska senator 
was always on the alert as to the rights and honors of 
&gt;old, 

lli-aring that the attorney general had given an opinion that 
the states would have to agree to continue the national ceme- 
M within their limits and might demand pay for the ground, 
In- o tiered a resolution of inquiry, and said: 

I have been led to believe, and I still believe, that those 

who fell fighting for our national existence earned a ful 
and unqualified title to the resting places where their bodie 
sleep. If they are to be disturbed on the refusal of th 
legislatures to give their consent, I desire to know it; o 
rather, I will say, I am opposed to asking the consent o 
any legislature or anybody else to secure the undisturbed </seg>

            <seg id="p067">

They died in the defense of their country, and their restinp 
places are hallowed spots. Sir, I am ready, for one, to 
say that if need be we will fight through another war to 
hold forever sacred the graves where our heroes sleep. 

On (he question involving the reconstruction of Virginia and 
Georgia, the senator indulged in a discussion covering the whole 
ground of secession and constitutional restoration — of democratic 
and republican records — diagnosing the disease and prescribing 
the political remedies. Notwithstanding all the two 
states had done in responding to the demands of congress, ho 
desired further indemnity for the past and greater security for 
the future. 

For congress he had words of eulogy, and for her champion 
garlands of perpetual renown. 

For the first time in our history it struck down the pro] 
of despotism, the doctrine of caste of race, or color, and 
declares the broad, philosophical, supremely just, and onlj 
true republican principle — the complete equality of all men 
in the possession of all civil and political rights. It in 
vested a race with the order of citizenship, it invested a 
race with the rights of manhood. By its command tha 
race, bowed down with the wronps of centuries, stood fort! 
erect under the broad panoply of eternal right. 

Ei much was the republican party divided upon questions at 
e and the democrats silent that the General said : 

I have remarked that a portion of the members of this 

body, those who belong to the opposite political faith, have 
remained entirely silent. They seem to be as serene and 

mposed as a summer's morning, or, to be still more poetic 
rain and unruffled as the waters of a moon-lit lake.

The senator from Mississippi totally misapprehends 0m 
object and intention of this bill. The object of the bill is to 
encourage and develop a prowth of timber west of the Mis»ouri

It will take capital, it will take money, to plant, cultivate 
and protect forty acres of timber for ten years, as the bill 
now provides. A man without capital can get his land now 
without money under the homestead law. 

The object of this bill is to encourage the growth of 
timber not merely for the benefit of the soil, not merely

Ee bill wan passed as thus amended and was operative for 
lytwo years. 

COLORADO 

&lt; &gt;n the 24th day of February, 1875, the senate proceeded to 
the consideration of a bill for the admission of Colorado, as a 
¦tote. Mr. Hitchcock, having the bill in special charge, and 
the session boinf: within eight days of its close, was anxions 
to sec it passed without amendment, which might cause its 
defeat in the House of Representatives for want of time. 

C'eeling tliat sufficient population and ample material reives 
existed, hut that no very recent census had been taken, 
his ingenuity was tested in the condensation of statistical estimates 
and historic facts. Knowing the temper of the senate, 
when time was short, and each one anxious to pass special 
measures, lie combined directness with brevity, as in his opening 
speech. 

Mr. President, at this period in the session, with the ca' 
endar filled with a long list of bills which have receive 
favorable action at the hands of the different committee 
and which are pressing for the formal and favorable actlo 
of the Senate, I believe that no extended discussion of tin" 
l&gt;ill is needed or would be justifiable. 

There is, I apprehend, and can be, but mm possible objee 
tion and but one possible question to be considered und boi 
one point upon which opposition can lie made to tin- p 
admission of Colorado. That ,rd to her </seg>




            <seg id="p071">
present population. Upon that point the Commltt 
Territories believe From the l&gt;est information which they 

Kahle to obtain th;it Colorado to-dav contains a populaof 
one hundred and fifty thousand. Of course this 
be based to a threat extent on statistics and estimates, 
official formal census of the Territory has been taken 
he last five years. 

The population of the Territory, by the census of l^TD. 
was about 40,000. There are some comparative estimates 
which can be made from the statistics of the Territory at 
that time, and statistics since that time which go to show 
ill.' ratio of the increase of population. For instance, the 
revenue of the postal department in 1870 was twenty-nine 
thousand and some hundred dollars. The revenue of the 
same department for the year 1S74 was $102,000, nearly 
four times the revenue derived from the postal service in 
the year 1870. 

I think there is no better, no surer test than that. The 
increase in the population is represented perhaps as accurately 
by the increase of revenue of the postal service 
as in any other way. So in other respects. At the time 
the census of IST'i was taken there was not in the territory 
a single line of completed railroad, and now there are 735 
miles built at an estimated cost of about $30,000,000. So that 
it is probable that no territory has been admitted with the 

Iepate of wealth, the aggregate of business, the fgl» 
of commercial importance that Colorado has at the 
ent time. Since the original constitution was adopted 
ity-four states have been admitted to the Union. Of 
t, Texas. Maine and West Virginia were separated from 
r states or admitted as independent sovereignties, as in 
case of Texas. Consequently twenty-one states have 
adniited from a territorial condition since the l'ovlent 
was founded. 

Of these twenty-one, but two were admitted as state 

which had at the time of their admission a greater population 
than Colorado now has, and these were Michigan and 
nsin, each of them having, I think, a population of 
about 200. 0O0; Minnesota having a population of about the 
same amount that Colorado now has, and the others, such 
states as Illinois and Ohio, having only about one third the 
population which Colorado now has. Situated in the center 
of the continent, extending from the 37th parallel of latitude 

¦he south to the 41st parallel of latitude on the north,

of 106,000 square miles: with a vast mineral wealth hidden

provisions of the bill. Mr. Sargent of California protested 
against allowing ."i per cent upon all sales of public lands made 

prior io i lie admission of the State.

I be usual words which ha\e been in other enabling act- 

anil which have allowed other incoming states to obtain .'.

Now I think it would not l&gt;e verv becoming in the United 
latcs to select Colorado as a conspicuous instance of econ- 

oinv. As a matter of economy. I am sure it is l&gt;etter that 
this hill should pass in its present form than that the Territory 
of Colorado should continue to he governed ai the expense 
of lh" luited States. 

The Slate of Nevada put in her assertion that she had not 
received the same ."&gt; per cent. fund, bill was promptly answered, 
that she had not a sale of lands prior to her admission: but did 
receive ii on subsequent sales. Mr. Kdmuiids desired six months 
to intervene between* the forming of a constitution and its 
adoption. 

Mr. Hitchcock could see this in no other light than an effort 
to postpone the admission of the State: hut the amendment was. 
however, adopted. Numerous others were ottered, aiid but a 
few | passed. 

After keeping up a verv prolonged and successful running 
debate, with such antagonists as Sargent of California. Stewart 
of Nevada, Edmund* of Vermont, Hamilton of Maryland and 
Bavard of Delaware, Mr. Hitchcock's labors were consummated 
Lthe passage of the bill, and in lsTfi Colorado became the

Mr. President, I want to tell the honorable senator that

are plenty in the immediate vicinity of these Indians, whe 
in ii only are acquainted with the Indian character. l&gt;ut have

UNION PACIFIC. 

ii the last elaborate speech of his senatorial term is found 
1 following extract : 

Mr. President, it is my fortune to reside upon the line "f 

the In ion Pacific Railroad. It was my fortune to see the 

first spadeful of earth ever thrown upon the grading of that 
road, and to be somewhat familiar with the history of its 
cimstruction, with the method of operation, and with the 

beneficent results which have come to the countrv and tin- 

world from that construction and operation. The construc- 

tion of a railroad across the continent, from ocean to mran 

marked an era in the material prosperity and development. 

not of this continent only but of the world. Existing for a 

quarter of a century or more only in the brain of enthn 

;istic dreamers, it remained for the statesmen who oom- 

trolled the destinies of the country in the dark hours of 
her struggle with armed rebellion to crystallize that drc:nn 

into a practical enactment; and it remained for the dari 

enterprise of the capitalists and business men of that time 

1" carry out the enactment to a glorious consummation. 
Like everything human, no matter how excellent, it had 

it* imperfections. It was marred and leaned by the c - </seg>

saw nothing in it better than a means of add i up to their 
wealth and their grain; and like everything human that is 
successful, it had no sooner become a success than it became, 
and still is, the object of continued bitter and persistent 
attack. 

During the process of its construction the country ranjr 
with plaudits of the magnificence of the enterprise and 
approval of the courage and energy with which it was 
prosecuted. No sooner was it completed than the country 
rang, as it still rings, with denunciation of it as a mighty 
fraud and swindle. I assert, Mr. President, and I do so 
without the fear of successful contradiction, that assuming 
that not one dollar of the principal or interest of the bonds 
which were advanced by this government to this railroad 
had ever been or ever would be paid except by the transportation 
which this company affords to the government, and 
saying nothing of the vast and almost measureless secondary 
consequential advantages which this country has received, 
and is receiving, and is destined to receive, this 
country has received every year, in transportation alone 
twice the amount of the interest which she has paid upon 
these bonds; that she has received a fund which so far exreeds 
the interest she has paid upon these bonds that it 
will, prior to the time when the bonds become due, amount 
to a much greater sum than the amount of the bonds. 

Sustaining bis views of the subject he quoted at length from 
dilators' speeches when the original Union Pacific bill passed, 

and also from a House report showing that transportation over 
the plains before \s*\- was costing the &lt;rovernnient from live to 

leven millions annuallv, whereas tlio annual interest on bonds 

would be one million per year. 

REFORM SCHOOL 

The last matter of business accomplished by him twenty-four 
hours before the expiration of his term, was the passage of an 
amendment to an appropriation bill. 

Mr. Hitchcock: I have been for six years a member of 
the District Committee, and I am somewhat familiar with 
the appropriations which have been made in the name ol 
charity to this district, and I believe of all the appropriations 
made there are none that have produced more benefl 
cent results from a small expenditure than the appropria 
tions which we have made annuallv for the reform school </seg>

The oath of office as a senator of i lit* United States in 

Mr. Morton, of Indiana, a 

prime factor in the Republican 
political dictator, moved the adk 
as senator from the state of 

party, almost amounting to a 
mission of I'. I!. S. l'inchl&gt;a&lt;

regular session of December, 1S7."&gt;. Mr. l'addock made it the 
subject of his maiden speech, having only previously occupied 
the attention of the senate with a few incidental remarks rela- 

tive to the expenses of the admission of Colorado as ¦ state. 

K taring promised that if the contest were purely political, or 
need to a choice of the "lesser of two evils" he would sus- 

tain the present applicant, he then set forth in most unequivocal 
terms his view of party dntv in the existing emergency. 

. Mr. President — As it is mainly an issue lietween Mr. 
I'inchlmek and the law, I shall vote for the law as I understand 
it. Albeit. 1 have not arisen to make a lejral argument. 
That indeed, sir. would be a work of supererogation 
on my part after the weary years of very able discussion 
that have already been given to this i|iiestion. I shall not s&lt; 

consume the time nor so abuse the patienee of the senate 
I desire only to say a few brief words in a spirit of the 
utmost kindness, sincerity and candor to my republican 
brethren in the senate and out of it as well. In rnv opinion 
sir. the republican party will not be strengthened bv the 
admission of Mr. Pinehback under the election upon which 
he bases his claim. A suspicion, almost a conviction, sir 
pervades the public mind everywhere that this selection was 
altogether a farce. Indeed, sir. very many republicans 

xinie of them in this ehaml&gt;er, more of them outside, who 
lune carefully examined all the law and all the evidence, 
anxious to disco\er therein the proper warrant of authority 
for Mr. Pinchbaek's admission to a seat in this ImhIv, have 

ministeriMl to Mr. Paddock in a sjierial session of the KMt* 
March r.tli. 1S7.1. </seg>

.Moreo er. . ne noie case is so cios ly reiaien exirn si 
cally to a condition of political affairs in Louisiana whiil 
is admitted on all hands to be so deplorable, while in and o 
iiM-lf. it has so few of the elements which the people an 
sure to require before they give to it their approval, anc 
it is withal immediately environed by complications so un 
republican in character, lhat in my humble judgment wa 
had better let it alone entirely. I say this, sir, with the Dt 
most deference for the opinions of the very able patriotic 
senators here who Ihink otherwise. And, sir, I wish it t&lt; 
be distinctly understood that, in what I may say upon this 
•liiestion, I disclaim utterly any intention to impugn the 
motives or to criticise the action of any senator upon this 
floor. I accord to all what I claim for myself: a conscien 
tious desire to discharge faithfully an important public 
duty. 

Id further uttering a note of warning, he said 

The people admire genuine manhood in the individual: 
they demand its fullest aggregation and development in a 
political party. The .republican party learned this long ago 
By its own acts alone will it be judged at the bar of public 
opinion and receive the approval or condemnation of the 
public as it may deserve. 

As ilic Mood of the emancipated race flowed in the veins of 
the Louisiana senator elect, Mr. Paddock declared he did not 
believe the admission of that officer would advantage the negro 
population. 

They can make no greater mistake, sir, than to insist 
that the republican party, their natural ally and friend 
shall take part with them in aggressive political movements 
which may be attended by many irregularities and sur 
rounded by illegal complications. 

The supremacy of the republican party, sir, must depend 
altogether upon the acceptability of its policies to the intelligent 
and the law abiding people of the great North. 
They, sir, will give much to the colored people of the South 
for defensive, but nothing for offensive warfare. 

This initial effort of the new senator from Nebraska ''drew 
the fire" of several distinguished political marksmen, who indnlged 
in the phrase— "oar lecturer." and evoked from General 
Ivoiran, of Illinois the declaration — "I do not feel like sitting </seg>

here ami befog Icetved by a republican m account of the vote 
I shall cast." The resolution of admission was never adopted. 
Haying entered into a defense of his party if was an easy and 

natural transition to the defense of emigrants and of his 

own 

constituents in the vicinity of Indian reservations. 

riONEEUS VINDICATED 

Mr. Paddock: There ought not to be a single day's delay 
in considering this question. It seems to me that the senate 
ought to take up the matter to-day and conclude it. The 
fact is patent to all that these people are already there in 
large numbers, aDd that there is bloodshed, carnage, ami 
destruction of life and property by this savage tribe which 
contests the advance of civilization. 

Action ought to be, and must be, had at once, and while T 
am up I must be permitted to say that it has been a very 
fashionable thing here to reflect upon the brave and enterprising 
people on the frontier who have sometimes pushed 
forward into the so-called Indian country; but it should b* 

remembered by our friends in the East that our friends on 
the frontier are only following the illustrious examples 
that have been set long before. They are only doing that 
which was done by the Pilgrim Fathers when they landed 

on Plymouth Rock, and by those who afterwards, following 
their example, went into Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, 
Illinois, Iowa, and other sections, repeating the history that 
had been made before. 

It is utterly impossible to restrain the American people 
when opportunities are presented to advance their fortunes. 
The same spirit of enterprise impresses all, whether they 
reside in New England or Nebraska. 

IMPEACHMENT OF BELKNAP. 

I Miring the 44th Congress Senator Paddock was called upon 
to sit as a member of a High Court of Impeachment, for the 
trial of W. W. Belknap, who as Secretary of War daring General 
Grant's administration, in 187fi, was charged by the house 
of representatives with having corruptly received large sums 
of money for appointing a post trader at Fort Sill.

impending, the always expected blow. He rose from 
his chair with great difficulty and often undoubtedly with 
much pain. Frequently while speaking he was compelled, 
from sheer physical exhaustion, to resume his seat: and

attacks of the insidious disease that was slowly but surely 
undermining- it.

and strong, with its wealth of graceful limbs, with its

had during many generations withstood the assaults of the 
angry tempests, gaining in each struggle increased development 
and strength- suddenly rent and riven, a deepened 
wound upon its noble trunk pointing out the lightning's 

track; and yet its umbrageous eanopv of limb and leaf ap 
peared, if possible, more perfect, more beautiful than ever. 
I i annot tell — perhaps no one but the Great Creator Himself 
will ever know— -whether there may not have been specially 
imparted to it, through some Dryad medium, something- of 
that force of will from the source of all power which gave 
to that charred and broken and wounded trunk the needed 
strength to draw from the fruitful soil the sustaining eletiecessary 
to the continuance of its great life. A 
few years later I have found this stupendous growth of nature 
a blasted, withered thing. A second bolt from Jotc's 
awful hand had descended and robbed it forever of life, 
and strength, and beauty; for the very last time it had 

"flung down its green glories to battle with the wind and 
storm." 

In respect of its inherent strength, its remarkable development, 
its superlative power and endurance at the maturity 
of its gTowth entitling it to superior rank among 
its fellows, as well as its final blight and decay, this wonderful 
creation of nature was aptly illustrative of the great 
life of the deceased senator before whose open grave we 
mourn. To him there was given a mental and physical 
organism with each faculty, each force so carefully, so perfectly 
adjusted to every other, the whole constituting a 
manhood of such symmetry and strength and power that 
in any sphere of life must have commanded for him superior 
station among his fellows. Endowments so rare were

succeeded by C. II. Van W'.yik, in issi. whose term expired in 
1887, Mr. Paddock devoted the interim as an active member 
of a commission established for the suppression of polygamy in 
Utah. 

On his return to the senate in December, 1887, at the commencement 
of his second term of six years, Mr. Paddock made a 
vigorous attack upon the Post Office Department, claiming that 
the interests of the West had been overlooked in l&gt;ehalf of the 
South and East.

is, and the party having the responsibility of administration 
which refuses great opportunities, when properly presented.

Having been ¦ uria of the Utah commission, the senator 
took gnat interest in everything relating to the material interest 
of the Territory. Advocating an appropriation for a public 
building he said: 

It is well known. I suppose, by the senator from Kansas, 
it is certainly by Western people generally, that Salt Lake 
is at the present time one of the most prosperous and one 
of the most rapidly growing cities in the West, and that it 
has a population to-day of fully M,MO. It is the great 
leader among the cities of the West, second only to Denver 
and Omaha of the cities between Chicago and San Francisco. 
It is a city which undoubtedly within five wars will

up and support the swindlers and the cheats whom thi 
measure will expose and brinp to justice. 

This congress of :tO4 days, next to the longest ever held, found 
Mr. Paddock at the head of the agricultural committee and 
eclipsing all previous records of bills, reports and speeches, presented 
and delivered. 

The length of the session was not disproportioned to the 
value of the themes acted upon, nor were those which were en;uted 
into law superior to many that remained in committee or 
went over on the files of the House. 

During the last hours of the 1st session of the 52d congress. 
Senator Paddock was found again contesting with Senators 
&lt;'oke, of Texas. Bate, of Tennessee, and Vest, of Missouri, for 
the passage of his specialty, the Pure Food Bill. 

He denied utterly the charges of the two former "that thorn 
sands and tens of thousands of officials would be required" in 
i he enforcement of the law, whereas only such articles as are 
the subject of interstate commerce were to be analyzed. He 
thought his opponents were "more troubled about cotton-seed 
oil than about the constitution." 

He repelled the assumption "that the people themselves, who 
had almost universally demanded it, had been moved chiefly 
by the desire to have inaugurated a cheap, nasty, political 
scheme for corrupt partisan uses." After an argument as to the 
constitutional power, and numerous citations from eminent authors 
and demands from the manufacturers for the passage of 
the bill he closed with a cogent appeal : 

Mr. President, in conclusion I appeal to senators to help. 
&gt;o far as they may be able, in this particular sphere of 

their legislative activities, to enact this law. 

In the name and in the interest of public morality, I 
appeal to you to set legislative bounds beyond which the 
wicked may not go with impunity in this corrupt and corrupting 
work. 

Let us help by our action here to protect and sustain in 
his honorable vocation the honorable producer, manufacturer, 
merchant and trader. In the interest of the great 
Killing public, particularly the poor, I beg of yon to 
an honest, earnest effort to secure this legislation.

that gambling in grains "made impossible the direct, free, and

&lt;&gt;p|M(siiion of those who believed then- was no warrant for it 
in the constitution of the I'nited States, inasmuch as it proposed 
to prohibit the business by excessive taxation, while the 
only [iidvince of national taxation should be "for revenue only." 

t^ud again that these contracts for future consummation were 
lpl.v between citizens of the same state and in no respect of 
interstate character, subject to that clause of the constitn-11 
regulating commerce between states: and that if an evil

SENATOR ALVIN SAl NHKHS 

March 4th. 1S77- March 4th, 1 

Ovreraor Alvin Haunden was elected to succeed Senator I'. 
W. Hitchcock, iu the Inited States Senate, in 1S77. in the 4."&gt;i h 
congress. As an appointee of Mr. Lincoln, in May, L8U, he 
l&gt;e&lt;;inie I lie successor of Governor Samuel Black of Pennsyl 
vania. and assumed the duties of Territorial Governor. Hi* in 

. 'iiml»&lt;-ii&lt;-v of that office, for six years, covered the most eventful 
period in Nebraska history. It wound up the life of a territory. 
and bailed the rise of a state. 

It bridged the gulf between the charred and desolate realm of 
slavery, and the vernal, captivating dominion of freedom. \&gt; 
Black was the last official of the aggrandizing South, so Saun 
ders became the first of the dominating North. In his tnH 
official proclamation, he sounded the tocsin of war. and de 
nounced treason and the traitor. In his tii-st official message he 
urged material aid for the Inion treasury, in hi* second felicilated 
the people on I he steady advance of the Inion arms, eiilo 
gized the Territorial troops, advocated monuments and rolls of 
honor, and emancipation as a military necessity. 

In his message of 1865, was heralded the march of Sherman 
to the sea. and in that of ISlit; came the joyous acclaim: "Our 
Hag, emblem of the unity of justice, power and glory of the 
nation now floats in triumph over every part of the Republic." 

Thus upon the pages of state history he erected the mile 
stones of national progress. While the commerce of the old 
world was seeking a new passage to the new and the visions 
of Fremont and Whitney had been cheered with the glimpan 
iron track across the American desert, and over the Bockj 
Mountains, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, in lSfil. the new 
Governor pointed to the great Platte Valley as the future route. 
Two years pass by and spade in hand he "broke ground" for 
"the greatest internal improvement ever projected In man." 
while from the summit of the Sierra Nevadas he viewed the

TAXATION AN1&gt; TARIFF KKFoKM 

lMnin-i the 1st acwioB of i he 4th engMi we find the sena 
i-aiiil.N eagaged in M ainument for ¦ reduction of inter 
axes mwiii matches, because as he said: 

They have become a necessity of the people and vet they 
are taxed at such a rate that the eOMHW l»"ys at least '-.'no 
per cent, more than the articles cost to manufacture. The 
tax brtagfl in abort *:i.000.000 to the Nation. It would l&gt;c a 
irrcat relief to the consumer if such a tax were taken off 
or this law repealed. Then take off the stamp tax on hank 
checks and drafts. That amounts to, about $'J,IKK&gt;,000 a year. 
While I am not an advocate of free trade. I am equally opposed 
to a high protective tariff simply for protection without 
regard to the article or industry to be protected. 

Two months later he urged 

the same procedure 

.\t the beginning of this session I took occasion Ul 
v\as opposed to a tariff commission bMMM I wanted congress 
to take hold of the matter and reform the tariff 
itself. Now more than one half of the session has passed 
and we all Unow that nothing will l&gt;e done unless it Im- to 
take hold of the smaller items. Therefore I have made up 
my mind that this commission can at least do us no harm 
and may do some good. Hence I shall vote for the commission 
and try the experiment. Here for install' 
We are collecting about $4O.IHKP.(K«i ¦ year on sugar, one 
quarter part, or one fifth part, of all the money paid for 
sugar by the consumers of this country: it is a tax direct 
on them and yet we are not torching it. 

Four mouths later he said of a House Kill 

lint the trouble is. it does not jjo far enough: it does not 
reach down to the i.'reat masses who are the producers, but 
who are also in many particulars the great consumers and 
who are therefore the heavy taxpayers.

I speak from what I know on this subject. I ha\e visited 

sonic of the Indians in my own state, and they say. "Why 
cannot we have a title to our own lands, the same as you 
white people ha\e'.' You do not giw it to us." I am glad to 
Know that one step has l&gt;een taken in the bill passed by the 

cnate a short time ago for the purpose of dividing out the

Then. I know further that these same Indians are now

grain. I saw them myself hauling' grain to Sioux City

conclusion of the trip of inspection, as chairman of the 
committee, reported against transferring the management 
of Indian affairs to the war department. The committee 
nas divided, but that portion of the report which was presented 
by the chairman was adopted. That report, whicl 
recommended the teaching of the Indians to work and to 
earn their own living, embodied the principles under which 
Indian affairs are now conducted; "and today," said the 
frovernor, "there are not ten men in congress, certainly not 
in the senate, who would favor any change from the course 
pointed out in our report." 

tint this success did not exceed his estimate of the value to 
attached to the acquisition of 600,0&lt;H) acres of land added 
Nebraska, by straightening the boundary line adjoining Daft. 


On the 2l8t day of February. 1881, Mr. Saundere called up 
his resolution to instruct the committee of commerce in the interest 
of a large appropriation for improving the Missouri River 
between iis mouth and Yankton. Dakota. He argued the neces&gt;f 
the case from the importance of the stream, '"which furnishes 
tin- largest and riches! valley of agricultural lands of 
any valley in the 1'nited States": and from the necessity of having 
clieai&gt; ilown river transportation brought ill competition 
with the lines of railroads; ojiening up a direct line of trail?-pni-tiuioii 
between the graft &lt; West mmt Kuropean markets, by 
way of the mouth of the Mississippi. 

The whole question of interstate commerce in connect ion with 
railroad subsidies and their extortionate charges ami favoritism 
* rough draw backs were drawn into the discussion, illustrated 
copious statistics. His imagination covered the Missouri 
and Mississippi with barges of grain and cattle, and swelled 
transatlantic commerce with countless American transports. 
In his summing up we have:

Oh. yes. it is all vei&gt; well: but this cry springs from the 
money center. It does not com,, from the preat muscle 
of this land that pays the most taxes. The people who toil 
are not finding- fault with what you pay out for pensions. 
The complaint does not come from the workshop, or the 
farm, or the counter. Oh. no; but the money centers have 
become alarmed; you see it in the great city of Xew York. 
An eleyant statue was proposed to be erected, and a net) 

eity witli its host of millionaires cannot find money enough 
to build even the pedestal 1o hold it. and ihey appeal to 
others for aid; to the men who drive tin- street cars, who 
work for sixteen or seventeen hours per day. and who 
then do not gel money enough to break their fast. They 
are appealed to to raise money enough to complete a pedestal 
to receive the great work of Haithohli. There is not 
a minor child on the pension roll but would ask Bay friend 

from Illinois and my friend from New Jersey and my friend 
from Kansas to stop just long enough to protect this very

we get the steel, and the steel is a success, and the steal

When the people of this country arc asking to be released 
from taxation they point to the treasury being- full to overflowing: 
so that there may be some relief in internal re\ei 
s and customs, duties and taxes: and the point is to 
stop the mouths of the |&gt;eople by taking- away, or drying; up 
that argument, so that they can be told. "The treasury is 
empty, and therefore this taxation must go on." This is the 
way you propose to drain the treasury anil empty it of its 
resources. 

In the expiring ilays of his senatorial term of six years, he 
delivered a most exhaustive speech upon a proposition to a-niend 
the constitution of the limited States so as to secure the election 
of the United States senators by direct vote of the people. 

Having examined the causes which made senators originally 
subject to legislative conditions, he claimed that a crisis was 
approaching in which the people would recall the delegated 
power and wield it through the omnipotence of the Imllot box.

Charles Frederick Vtaaderaon, Brevet Brigadier Geaeral, 
Inited Stait-s Senator from Nebraska, and a lawyer by profession, 
was bora in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. February !». ls:'.7. 
He was the son of John Manderson. who was born in 1799 in 
County Antrim. Ireland, of Scorch-Irish ancestry and emigrated 
lo America when a small child, and lived nearly all his life in 
the 'iiy of Philadelphia, where he was well known and where he 
died in 1885, at the age of eighty six years. The mother of 
Charles F. Manderson was Katherine Benfer. who was born in 
the city of Philadelphia, was of German extraction, and died in 
that city when our subject was a small child. 

Charles Frederick Manderson received his education in the 
public schools of Philadelphia, and. when of proper age, was 
admitted to the High School of that city, an excellent institu 
tion. and under the general direction of Professor Hart, who 
was president of the faculty. At the age of nineteen he removed 
to Canton, Ohio, where he studied law and was admitted 
to the bar in 188*. In the spring of 18(iO he. was elected city 
solicitor of Canton, and was re-elected the next year. 

General Manderson was married at Canton, April 11th, 1865. 
to Rebecca S.. daughter of Hon. James D. Brown, a lawyer of 
prominence, who died at Omaha. Nebraska, in 1871. His wife's 
maternal grandfather, John Harris, was one of the first settlers 
of the state of Ohio, and a lawyer who achieved high professional 
standing and renown in the early history of the State.

Having lmsied liinisclf mostly with the investigation of questions 
that pertained directly 10 his own state and region of 
covBtrr, for the space of three months, he was foitunaie in the 
sfliiticm of a theme on which to make his first oratorical effort 
before his deliberate ami dignified associates; a theme on which 
the soldier's patriotism could dominate the lawyer's acquisitions 
in sustaining a military verdict. He stated the question at 
as follows: "Adopting the language of the advisory 
board, ii asks that the Congress shall annul and set aside the 
finding! and sentence of the court-martial in the case of Major 
lien. I'itz.lolm Porter and restore him to the position of which 
that sentence deprived him." His introduction was very con-

Mr. President Hut a few months before the day when 
Porter rested idly in the shade while the loud-mouthed cannon 
gave to him unheeded invitation, a far different 
was enacted in the West, and I would like to hold it up in 
contrast. The capture of Fort Donelson had opened ¦ clear 
pathway by water and by land to our forces, and (Irant. 
with his arinx. was near Pittsburg Landing. The glorious 
victory of Thomas at INT ill Springs, the fall of Howling Creen 
and the surrender of Xashville had cleared Middle Tennessee 
for the marching columns of Buell. Along- the beaten 
roads during the pleasant spring da.vs they Bored. On 
April fi. with the impetuous Nelson and the gallant ( rittenden 
in the lead, the head of Huell's army approached Savannah 
on the Tennessee River. The day was nearing its close 
and the tired men were longing for camp and rest. Suddenly 
the faint sound of a distant gun. Another and another 
in quick succession. The straggling lines of troops 
instinctively gather in more compact form. Without command 
to that effect the marching step quickened. The sullen 

Ixmin of the artillery was more distinctly heard as the 
distance lessened. 

The fact was apparent. Our brothels of the army of the 

Tennessee were engaged. The battle was on. but mile! 
nway and across the deep and rapid river. A long and weari 

-nine march had been made that day by these divisions 
Tired and hungry and likelv to so remain, for there wen 

ed rations in their hav 

rsacks and the wagons miles 
i come up. The leaders of 

rear and not likelv t 

commands need no ord 
rest be taken after the batik 

is tu hasten on and let the 
is lust or won. The ¦'sound

needed. The "old sea d&lt; 

Nelson, taking to water, naturally. I suppose. !cn\es the 
main road and leads his division o\er a shorter one through

in a discussion, time and again, upon the subject of pensions, 
and defended the Grand Army of the Republic in its ob 
its elements and broad catholicity. He declared it a 
iv founded upon deep seated sentiments of patriotisn 
fiiirncd in as to have become akin to religion and one which 
• Miiipk'H-ly commands the confidence of the people. Its wat&lt; li 
winds are fraternity, charity and loyalty. There belongs to it 
tiii-ii of all polities] parties. At its post meetings and its departmental 
and national encampments men of all possible polilies 
take active and prominent part, advising conservativ. 
lion and conducting into proper paths. Meridian and Grant. 
Hancock and Logan, were all members of this patriotic order. 
desiring no higher position in it than that of comrades, and 
claiming no superiority over the enlisted men they had so often 
led to victory. By its creed every one of its members had 
tmised "to assist sneh former comrades in arms as needed 
p and protection, and to extend needful aid to the widows 
I orphans of tlmse who had fallen." This promise is not mere 
lip service. "By their fruits shall ye know them." He said, in 
a combat of words with Senator Blackburn of Kentucky:

Later on in the same tirst session of the 5flth congress the 
senator look part with Senator Vest, of Missouri, in a discussion 
of the causes which had enabled Chicago to control so large 
a share of the cattle trade of the great Southwest, at the expense 
of St. Louis. 

In this debate he gave evidence of a very thorough knowledge 
the production of the beef-producing region — the causes cirnscribing 
the range limits, as homesteading and pre-empting, 

— the amount handled by the mammoth packing houses of 
Armour, Hammond. Morris, Swift and Libby of Chicago, and 
with prices of purchase and sale, together with interest Nebraska 
has in feeding her surplus corn to the grass-fed herds of 
the plains. 

Another question of prime importance to the region of 
braska bordering on Colorado, and to the far west and southwest 
was that of irrigation. He had seen what it had done in 
Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona, wherever tried on 
a small scale, and had seen the alkali plains of Humboldt 
Desert "blossom as the rose," as the result of being placed 
£der ditch." Hoping much from a national effort at reclamai, 
he proffered a cordial support to the sisterhood of the 
ren plains.

When a proposition was pending for the purchase of certain 
historical collections, subject to the opinion of the Librarian of

volunteered a very facetious criticism: 

Mr. President We are told that this is a work of fully 
&gt;ne hundred volumes, and of seven or eight hundred folio 

pages in each volume, made up of the character of historical 
material which is mentioned in this report. I am 
afraid that even if the life of Mr. Spofford should be prolonged 
to that old aire to which we all wish him, he could 
do nothing else for the rest of his life but read these 
ponderous tomes and would die before he was well into

am afraid we shall purchase none whatever for the eon 
gressional library. Take all the great historians, even our 
own historians. Prescott and Bancroft, and if their works 
are not to be bought provided there is nothing in them 
but authentic history by the judgment of one expert I 
am afraid they would all be ruled out and none be purchased. 
Even the book of books, the Bible, has received 
most severe criticism as to its being authentic history 
and under a rule, such as is proposed here, we could hardly 
take it into any public library of the country. 

1 think it is Burns who said: 

"Some books are lies frae end to end, 
And some great lies were never penned 

And you will find that in every historical work there 
an be found chance for criticism, and unauthentic state- 

ments claimed, such as might be raised against this put 
lication. It would defeat the object of the bill to adoji 
;mv such amendment. 

On the subject of distributing half a million dollars "T| 
numerous sectarian Indian schools, so one should not overreach 
another, his words were brief but comprehensive, condemnatory 

of serial ian ¦fficwitf Hf . and a slight reminder of New Eng 
1;&gt; iid's volunteer sympathy and counsel "at long range."' 

I do not believe in offering with one hand either foot 
or civilization to the Indian and with the other attempt 
to cram into him sectarian teachings. There has been an 
unseemly spectacle presented in this whole matter, in this 
unchristian combat and competition that has existed among 
ilifferent denominations, for the purpose of getting more o 
the amount that is to be paid to these sectarian schools 
It might, perhaps, be better to take them from their reser 
\ations, rent houses for them if you please, in the Eastern 
States, and maintain them there in idleness, and let their 
children attend the common schools of the country, rather 
than pursue the present policy.

Mil. Manderson: Mr. President, two years ago there came 
to mi' the distinguished honor of election as the President 
/nil tim/Hii) of the Senate. No suitable time has seemed to 

come when I could make that recognition of this distinction 
which I should like to do. and I desire now to expres 
my deep sense of obligation and my very hearty thanks to 
my political associates on this side of the chamber, b; 
whom the distinction was proposed, and at the same time 
to thank very heartily those of opposing politics, who mad 
no nomination against the selection of the republican cau 
i us. There came, therefore, to me this place by the unan 
imons vote of the Senate of the United States. I thank al 
from the depths of my heart for this distinction, and 
further want to express my obligation for that forbearance 
on the part of all which has enabled me when I have been 
the occupant of the chair to administer. I hope with some 
satisfaction to the Senate, the duties that devolved upon 
me. 

Recognizing a change of condition and perhaps also a 
change of theory, I now tender my resignation of the position 
to the Senate and ask to be excused from further duty 
in that regard. 

Mr. Sherman: I move that the resignation of the honorable 
Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Manderson) as President 
pro temporr of the Senate be received and accepted. 

The motion was agreed to. 

Mr. Voorhees: Mr. President, at the close of the last se«

resolution, which was unanimously adopted by this body 
thanking the distinguished Senator from Nebraska (Mr 
Manderson) for the able, courteous, and most satisfactory 
manner in which he had discharged the duties of the high 
office which he has just now resigned. There the matte 
might rest: hut it has been suggested that in addition, in 
taking leave of him in his official capacity as Presiden

the port of free trade; her cargo was concealed under her

in this country were under her decks, for sale abroad. 

Her crew -1 will not say "a motley crew." although it

pained on the second day of this session to witness a fruitless 
and partisan discussion, somewhat acrimonious, and in 
my judgment entirely unprov oked. precipitated upon the

Mr. President. I am an humble member of a new political 
party that has recently come into existence and public 
notice, made necessary by the constant drifting of the Nation 
from its original constitutional moorings into the shallow 
and treacherous waters of unchecked power. The 
people — and I speak of the masses ha\e so frequently appealed 
to the general government for wise and humane 
monetary legislation, only to have their appeals fall on deaf 
or unsympathetic ears, that it kMHH necessary as a matter 
of self-preservation for them to create a new political 
party, founded upon Jeffersonian simplicity, and imperatively 
demanding a return of the Nation to first principles 
of government: and I am pleased to say that this party, 
full of hope and confidence, is hourly growing in numbers, 
in courage, intelligence, and discipline, and will, sooner or 
later, force the two old parties of the Nation into administering 
the affairs of the government in the interest of the 
people, or into political disintegration and death.

The People's party of America, while taking strong 
grounds on the subject of national taxation, asserted in the 
most positive terms that the crowning questiou of this 
country and this age was the question of money; and in 
less than five months from the close of the election in 
November last the Nation was confronted with an industrial 
and financial depression such as has not been witnessed 
in this country for fifty years, if indeed its equal has 
ever been known. 

To-day the Democratic and Republican parties are brought 
face to face with a condition of public affairs that was foretold 
by the common people months l&gt;efore it happened. </seg>

~ 

Mr. President Is the President correct in his conclusion 
thiit tin 1 Sherman act is the cause of our trouble? In my 
judgment. Mr. President, the Sherman act has nothing- to 
do in the slightest degree with the evil that confronts us. 
No one li;is )m-coiiic frightened at the ability of this government 
to redeem every pledpe it has made, as fast as its 
pledges shall become due. 

While we all understand that the purchasing clause of the 
Hill I ¦¦¦ net is a miserable makeshift, resorted to and enacted 
to avoid the blessing- of the free and unlimited coinage 
of siher. as has been confessed in this chamber, yet it 
is wiser by far to retain it until something better is offered 
in its place, than to surrender to an enemy who has teenconstant 
in season and o\it of season for twenty years to 
strike down silver and deprive the people of one-half of 
their constitutional money: thus increasing in enormous 
proportion the debts of the people, shrinking the value of 
their property and labor, and making the rich richer and 
the poor poorer. 

Sir. the Sherman act is the last feeble barrier that stands 
between the patriotic and industrious masses of our people 
and that horde of insolent, aggressive and ravenous moneychangers 
and gamblers of Lombard street and Wall street, 
who for private gain would, through a shrinking; and con: 
tracted volume of money, turn the world back into the 
glomn of the Dark Ages with all its attendant evil and 
misery. We cannot suffer this to l&gt;e done; we must stand 
like a wall of fire against its accomplishment, and only when 
the measure that is to succeed the present law is shown to 
us and enacted into a law can we with safety repeal the 
Sherman ait. 

Illustrative of the promptness with which Senator Allen 
• spoused official duties, the fact is that on the ninth day of th»» 
ssiun lie offered an amendment to a bill, providing that in 
i&lt;-rest should cease upon bonds as the basis of bank note issues 
dariag the time such notes were in possession of the bond 
holders, and upon request, volunteered a few explanatory remarks,

like a perpetuation of tbf national hunks. The time lias 
come when we should take some radical steps to eliminate 
them from our institutions, and it occurs to me that this 
amendment, and especially the second proviso of it. if 
adopted, would give the country warning that we intend. 
as soon and as speedily as possible, to drive out of existence 
the national banks of issue.

mncnis and statements, in a lew well chosen words, as in 
caw of "balance of trade": 

Mr. President, we have been told that the nation in whose 
favor the "balance of trade" exists at the close of the tradinir 
season is to be considered the most fortunate nation, 
and thai we must so order the affairs of this country as to 
annually obtain this balance of trade. A balance of trade 
is only a national blessing when it represents some profit to 
our |&gt;eople. If it is bought by the sale of our products far 
below their cost, and at a sacrifice of our civilization, it is 
¦ curse rather than a blessing. Of what benefit can it be 
to the people of this country if they should obtain the 
entire stock of European gold by a sacrifice of their property 
and labor, while Europe may be enjoying their products 
as well as profits? If the balance of trade is to be purchased 
at a sacrifice, we have only to indulge in such luxury 

for a few years to completely 
destroy our national wealth. It

irade should be annually against 
too great a sacrifice.

Also in ifferencf to equality or parity 

How is it expected to institute I comparison between two 
unequal things — two things that arc, according to an imperatne 
law of nature, considered as articles of commerce — 
traveling in opposite directions'? Cold daily growing more 
sea lie and in greater demand throughout the civilized 
world, and silver crippled by being denied equal coinage 
privileges at the mints, growing more plentiful, with lessened 
money use. it must be expected that their commercial 
value will radically differ. But put both metals upon an 
equality before the law, and they will stand equal in the 
commercial and monetary world. I do not doubt that the 
very moment silver is permitted free access at the mints 
its price will go up throughout the civilized world. Only 
last week the London silver market advanced in anticipation 
of the action of congress retaining the present Sherman 
act. </seg>

of the measure btfsft the Senate for the unconditional

it in the discharge of its duty upon a resolution or request,

October 4th, on the subject of contraction he said 

I wish to call attention to the fact that in 1866 the government

Mr. President — It is quite true that a majority have a 
right to rule in this country, but they have a right to rule 
only when the minority have expressed their opinion according 
to legal methods and in accordance with .the constitution 
or the statutes creating and giving power to the 
minority to express themselves. Nothing is better settled 
in this country (and I diverge at this point for a moment) 
than that this is a government of laws, not of men; and 
whenever the constitution gives a minority the right to contest 
the ground occupied by a majority and eventually bring 
them to their senses, if they have lost their senses upon 
any public question, the minority have a right to do that 
without being charged with being filibusters or obstructing 
the orderly conduct of the government.

NEBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

Prelide to Speech of October 7, 11 and 12 

Eie real question at issue was, Shall an act be passed denying 
rigbt of the government to further purchase silver for 
age. without restoring to the people the right of "unlimited 
age." which they had possessed for 81 years prior to 1873? 

Half the Democrats of the Senate, with a majority of the 
Republicans, making a small majority of the whole body, were 
willing to repeal the purchasing clause of the Sherman act of 
IBM, without restoring "free coinage," while the balance of the 
Democrats, with a minority of Republicans and the four Populists, 
were willing to repeal the act, and in the same bill restore 
the •"unlimited coinage of silver." 

ti behalf of the last proposition Senator Allen delivered the 
oduction of his astonishing speech October 7th, and on the 
i commenced again and continued it from 5 p. m. to 8 a. m.. 
ober 12th — fifteen hours. 

The supposed majority could not stop debate, because the 
Bemte had no rule allowing a call of the previous question. Bo 
they determined to keep the Senate in perpetual session till. 
overcome for want of sleep and rest, the silver advocates should 
submit to a final vote. 

Phey further determined that they should not transact any 
«T business during the time they were exhausting their ent-s. 
and hence refused to adjourn the Senate for two weeks 
used a recess to carry them over from day to day. 

twhen the chaplain opened the Senate with prayer October 
they dismissed him for the time being, as that day was to 
till they could force a vote. 

Of this parliamentary strategy Mr. Allen spoke as follows: 

Mr. President — Another singular thing- is that there has 
not been a legislative day since ten days ago. One week 
ago last Tuesday we started upon a legislative day and we 
are continuing that day now. 

It has been a time-honored custom whether it is a rule 
or not I do not know — that the proceedings of this body 
should be opened by prayer. There has not been a prayer 
offered in this chamber in ten days. I desire to say. Mr. 
President, that in my judgment it was fitting that this Sen- </seg>


            <seg id="p163">
371 

ate should cease listening to prayers at the time it did and 
when it started into the accomplishment of this most 
iniquitous of all legislation in our national history: and I 
suppose after a time, when this unconditional repealing act 
takes place and gold is set up as the single standard and 
the sole god of some, the men of Wall Street and Lombard 
Street, whose sympathizers are here and elsewhere outside 
of this ehanil&gt;er. will come together and sing that good old 
song— 

Nearer, my God. to Thee 

Nearer to Thee. 

for gold is their god. Not only so. but in consequence of 
not having another legislative day. this government is put 
at the absolute mercy of one man. It is a complete revolution 
of our government. It takes here, for instance, 
unanimous consent for the last ten days to get a measure, 
however important it may be, before this body. Suppose 
something should occur requiring our instant attention, it 
would require the unanimous consent of Senators here to 
enable us to consider it. There is a complete change in the 
organization. The right of petition, held sacred under our 
constitution, regarded as sacred by every citizen of this 
land, is cut o'ff here in consequence of this continuoi: 

sion. Every safeguard guaranteed to the people of this 
country by the constitution must be abandoned or imperiled 
for the instant accomplishment of this infamous 

scheme. This is something that in my judgment ought not 
to exist in a legislative body uf the dignity anil responsibility 
of this. 

During the night sessions the majority learned that "chkkMM 
&lt; unit' home to roost." for silver party advocates decided that a 
quorum of the Senate should be present at all times, and as 
often as the repealers betook themselves to cots and lounges in 
the cloak rooms for slumber, a call of the Senate was ordered, 
and they had to return and answer to their names. 

tt 8 o'clock on the morning of the 12th the majority saw their 
iry of wearing out Silver Senators completely exploded by 
"bright and early" Senator from Nebraska. 

Mr. At. lex: Mr. President — There are many other interesting 
features of this question which I have failed to discuss, 
yet I think a sense of duty to other Senators, who 
have not yet had an opportunity to speak upon this question,' 
requires that I should give way this morning to Senators 
who are prepared and who are desirous of being heard. </seg>

put to me by the Senator from Louisiana. The Senator from

means, whether he means to insult me. I do not think

Senator from New Hampshire believes. He should be more 
ful of his language. The Senator from Nebraska understands 
the ordinary English language and its use." 

ITo Mr. Palmer: "Several Senators have attempted to make 
s assault my own state. It is not only disagreeable, but it is 
,t true." 

I Mr. Allen having called Senator Palmer to order, for charging 
tn with speaking against time, said, "I will not suffer an imitation 
of that kind to be made without a denial."

            <seg id="p165">
Mr. Palmer: The Senator will deny if he chooses. I have 
xpressed the belief that no mortal man who intends simply 

to instruct can speak twelve or fourteen hour:

Mr. Allen said 

Mr. President Tin- first time I appeared in the Beast* I 
felt as though I OBght to apologize for doing so. The first 
time I had occasion to submit some observations upon the 
measure now under consideration I felt that I was under 
an obligation to apologize to the Senate for doing so and 
for breaking what I understand is an unwritten rule which 
has been in force in this body for many years, that a new 
member shall listen rather than talk. I presume if any 
apology is due from me to-day it is not to the Senate or 
the United States, but to Wall Street and Lombard Street 
for delaying somewhat the passage of the measure now 
before the Senate.

Mr. Stewart: Will the Senator from Nebraska yield that 
I may suggest the want of a quorum? 

Mr. Stewart: All right: but I think Senators would learn 

umething if they would come her 

Mr. Al.I.KN: I will make them hear me whether they are

Proceeding at once to gr 

apple with what he di'iioniin 

political fallacies, he announced as the first: 

THE FALLACY OF INTRINSIC VALU1 

Mr. President — Our friends upon the other side have 
taught many political heresies, and one of the heresies 
taught by them in this discussion has been the chief of 
heresies, intrinsic value. My friend, the Senator from Oregon 
(Mr. Dolph), on two separate days sent out for a dictionary, 
had it brought in here, and read it to us to show 
that there was suoh a thing as intrinsic value in money. 

Mr. Al-LEN: Xo. I do not care for a quorum </seg>

            <seg id="p166">
374 

[^ (¦ •¦ »V i m^ 1 ¦ w H I • ' ¦ 9 % 1 ' I » !^^ *\ 1 f # I I * 

What is meant by intrinsic value? The advocate of the 
pciH standard tells us that intrinsic value is that commercial 
value which resides in the money, thing or metal, and 
that there must be a correspondence between that thing 1 
and the coin value or the money is flat money, and therefore 
unsound. 

The material of which money is coined or on which it is 
stamped is withdrawn from the field of commerce when 
Wine used as money. It is as dead in its effect upon the 
commercial value of the class of articles to which it belongs 
as though it were in the bowels of the earth or in the bottom 
of the ocean; it is taken out of circulation as an 
article nf commerce, and is used exclusively as a medium 
of exchange, performing the money function and losing its 
place as an article of commerce. 

Works on political economy of recent date are discarding 
this doctrine of intrinsic value in money. It is the function, 
the office performed by the thing called money, which gives 
it its money value. It is the volume, the number of units 
in lirrulation. and which are exchanged against all other 
things, which gives money its proper power and its proper 
money value. There is no more necessity for a dollar's 
Ix-inf.' made of gold, or silver, for that matter, than there 
is for a yardstick to be made of ivory or gold. You might 
;is well say that by measuring a yard of cloth with a yardstiek 
made of gold, you would give the cloth measured 
more value than it would have if it were measured with a 
Yardstick of wood or some other inferior material. The 
wealth resides in the articles which are exchanged, and not 
in the money which effects the exchange. 

SECOND FALLACY. 

That a gold standard would not produce contraction 

Mr. President — Suppose in this country a law were passed 
prohibiting the consumption of one class of meat products, 
does not every citizen know that the prices of other classes 
which were not prohibited would be doubled in value? 
The demand would be doubled for them, and that is what 
increases prices. If the government should, for instance, 
strike down wheat, if it should be decreed that the people 
should not eat wheat bread, would it not create a greater 
demand for corn, oats, and other kindred products? It certainly 
would, because the functions performed by wheat 
would be transferred to other products. So it is with silver. 
Whenever the government strikes down silver, and says that 
it shall not be used for money purposes, and puts the entire </seg>

            <seg id="p167">
375 

NEBRASKA IN THE U. 8. SENATE. 

basis of the currency upon gold, that increases the value 
of (fold and gives it a greater purchasing power than it 
would otherwise possess. That is contraction. 

THIRD FALLACY OVERPRODUCTION. 

But one of the principal arguments used against the use 
of silver is what my distinguished friend from Illinois (Mr. 
Palmer) lamented awhile ago as overproduction. It is 
claimed, and claimed seriously, that silver is being produced 
in such great quantities as to cause an overproduction of 
the metal, and that the fall in the bullion price of the metal 
is caused thereby. Therefore my friend from New Jersey 
(Mr. McPherson) says the parity cannot be maintained. 
Why there is overproduction we are not told. Never was 
there a ranker fallacy promulgated upon the face of the 
earth than this doctrine of overproduction. There is not 
a respectable political economist, from the days of the 
senior Mill to the present moment, that has taught it. It 
is simply one of those fallacies that we find constantly 
Ugld from the stump, that we find constantly advocated 
by a certain class of newspapers, the effect of which is to 
mislead the people. 

Right here. Mr. President, let me say that gentlemen who 
advocated this doctrine of overproduction never seem to 
think of the fact that in this land of plenty, where overproduction 
exists, as they claim, want is constantly increasing: 
and that there are hungry men. hungry women, and 
hungry children in a country where prices are falling, as 
they claim, in consequence of overproduction. 

It is under consumption and the lack of means of distribution, 
one principal element of which is money, that produce 
local and temporary congested conditions in trade. 

And it is characterized as a fallacy here and throughout 
these works [Reading]. 

It is perpetually reappearing in different forms, among 
which may be here specified the belief that our colonies 
are useful because they provide a market for our exports. 

When the people of this country, the farmers and laborers, 
and what I may properly term the great masses of the 
common people, feel the effects of this system of contracted 
money, they are told that their misfortune is due to overproduction: 
that they produce too much, that God is too 
bountiful, that the people suffer too much corn, wheat and 
oats to grow, and produce too much food. Therefore, in 

land of plenty, in consequence of there being too much, 
there must be starvation and hunger as a result. In consequence 
of too much, laboring men must be poor. </seg>

            <seg id="p168">
376 


FOURTH FALLACY BALANCE OF TRADE 

Mr. Ai.lex: Another of the fallacies taught, in my judg 
aft, in this discussion is the fallacy of the balance of 
trade. I do not mean to say that the balance of trade is 
not desirable under certain circumstances, but I do mean 
to MJ that a balance of trade in and of itself, bought by 
:i Merfflee of the property and labor of the people, is a 
curse rather than a blessing. Too long the people of this 
country have been told that a favorable balance of trade 
was per sr evidence of prosperity. Suppose that every gold 
dollar upon the face of the earth was bought by this Nation 
at the sacrifice of the price of our labor and our property, 
would that be any evidence that we were a prosperous 
nation under those circumstances? 

It is only when a balance of trade represents some profit 
to a nation that it is a favorable balance of trade; it is only 
when it represents some profit to its people that it is desirable. 
If it is bought at too great a sacrifice, if civilization 
iisdf has to be impaired, if labor has to be debased, if we 
are to lie brought down to the conditions prevailing in 
Kurope, then we do not desire to pay the price for the 
balance of trade in gold dollars. 

FIFTH FALLACY NATURAL PARITY 

I ask any Senator in this chamber when he talks about 
maintaining a natural parity between gold and silver, is 
it possible'.' Certainly not. If there was a natural law of 
equality between the two metals, would not one grain of 
the metal, silver, be worth as much as a grain of gold? If 
there was a natural parity existing, would not that be true? 

The relation of gold and silver, like the relations of any 
other articles, must be controlled by the law of supply 
and demand. 

As long as Senators talk about the commercial value in 
the money metal or the money thing, there can be no such 
thing as a parity between gold and silver, because today the 
demand puts the price of one up and the price of the other 
flown, when to-morrow, next week, next month or next 
year the conditions may be entirely different, and the metal 
that occupies one position to-day may be absolutely reversed 
then. That is simply following the supreme law of 
supply and demand. So it is mere nonsense to talk about 
maintaining the parity when a natural parity does not exist. 

But if you can establish and maintain a parity when you 
leave the fallacy of intrinsic value, then you come to the 
sensible basis, the basis which controls this matter: when </seg>



            <seg id="p169">
BI.K. 



.you declare by statute that so many grains of silver shall 
have the force of money as compared with a grain of gold, 
when the power of the law behind that makes it perform 
the office of money, gives it full legal tender and debt-paying 
power, and establishes a law of equality between the 
two metals while being used as money. That is the real 
parity, and the only parity that can either be created or 
maintained. 

H FALLACY SHERMAN LAW THE CAUSE OF PRESENT TROl 

Mr. President — It is true that every dollar of gold that 
left these shores during the last few months has returned, 
except about $16,000,000, and that will return if these men 
who control the money market will permit it to return. So 
that if its departure was due in any measure to the Sherman 
act, then with equal propriety we may say that its 
return is due to the same act. 

Cold will shift from America to England, back and forth, 
according to the demand for gold itself, wherever the rate 
of interest is the highest. If there is a greater demand for 
it in England than there is here, it will go there. Like everything 
else, whenever the demand is greater for it here 
than it is in Great Britain, when it is worth more here, it 
will come here. So we are engaged in the enterprise of putting 
the gold of the world upon an auction block and entering 
upon a wild, nay, a senseless, bidding for the pos~ 
of gold, sacrificing our property and sacrificing the prosperity 
of our people in a senseless race of that kind. 

EVKXTH FALLACY DISHONEST MONET. 

We have been told repeatedly, and are daily told, that 
there is such a thing as sound money in the country and 
such a thing as dishonest money. 

Mr. President, there is not a dollar in this nation, with 
full legal tender qualities, from its origin to this moment, 
that was not an honest dolfar and worth as much as any 
other dollar. It is only because the volume of gold is 
scarce; because it is in the grasp of the Shylocks. because 
they control it and. through it, control the destinies and 
the progress of the peoples of the Earth that we hear so 
much about the necessity of sound money — of honest 
money. This very heresy of intrinsic value is one of the 
things that has been seized upon to deceive and mislead the 
people, thus permitting a gang of aggressive money-changers 
to control the destinies of the people through a limited 
volume of money, through the control of gold. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 

I repeat, sir. during the interesting discussion in this chamber, 
extending now over sixty days, no Senator has offered 
a reason (if he has I have not heard it) why any special 
commercial value should reside in silver or gold or paper 
used as money. 

MONEY POWER. 

Now. what is the money power? The expression has been 
used here a great many times. It has been used by myself, 
and it has been used by others. I say to the Senators that 
the money power, in my judgment, is that class of persons 
who control the great debt, bonds, stocks, and mortgages 
of this country and of Europe — that body of men who are 
directly interested in a constantly appreciating money, 
whose fortunes are made out of bonds, mortgages, stocks, 
and evidences of indebtedness of various kinds; that body 
of men. small though it may be, in this country and in 
Kurope who are combined against the prosperity of the 
farmer and laborer throughout the civilized world — that is 
the money power. 

Eliis ((inclusion he traced England's oppression of the 
in;il American colonies, lier acts of tyranny in the revolution 
770 and in the war of 1MJ: and characterized the bill as a 
t»ter of iniquity. 

This is a Trojan horse: but underneath and behind this 
whole scheme I see two monster Shylocks, like Argus, hundred-eyed, 
and like Briareus. hundred-handed. One of these 
is England, and the other the Shylocks of Wall Street and 
the East, both alike reaching out their long, bony and 
merciless hands for their pounds of flesh, regardless of the 
welfare of the laboring classes and producers of this country, 
regardless of the prosperity of this country, but interested 
solely and alone in their own selfish aggrandizement. 

In 1811, when the charter of the United States Bank expired, 
the stock of which had been paying an annual dividend 
of from 8 to 10 per cent, it was discovered that the 
Knglish had gotten control of nearly all the stock. Since 
then she has gradually gotten control of our carrying trade. 
Weeding us of millions of dollars every year. She has gotten 
control of large areas of our public lands, of immense 
tracts of our coal, timber, and mineral lands, which she has 
bought for a song, and from which she will reap immense 
profits. She has bought large interests in our most profitable 
flour mills, our breweries, stockyards, and manufacturers. 
She holds our bonds and has made millions specu- </seg>

            <seg id="p171">
379 


latinp in them. She draws annually from the United State* 
over $100,000,000 in the shape of interest and profits alone. 
Notwithstanding' all these things the agent of the Rothschilds 
now comes in the year 1893, in the year of the Columbian 
Exposition, and the one hundred and seventeenth year 
of our Independence, and demands of our Secretary of the 
Treasury in these United States of America that he issae 
$150,000,000 worth of bonds. 

American, British, Grecian and Roman history, with ancient 
mythological and patriotic allusions, gave special force to hi« 
closing words. A journal at the capital, not in sympathy with 
Populist views, said of this remarkable effort: 

It is an effort that does credit to the patient research of 
the Nebraska Senator and contains a vast amount of statistical 
information. It also shows that whenever an 
emergency arises requiring such a speech Mr. Allen is folly 
equal to its requirements, anil that when it comes to colloquial 
debate on the floor of the Senate, he is quite aa 
ready in answering 1 interrogatories as in propounding 
theories. 

It is furthermore apparent from the classical peroration 
with which Mr. Allen closes his remarks that come what 
may he is never to be driven from his position or cajoled 
out of it. "So far as I am concerned," he says, "I ask no 
favors and wear the collar of no man; and when the Shylocks 
of England, Wall Street and the East, and their coadjutors, 
ask that the rights of the people be surrendered, 
my answer, so far as I am concerned, will be that not one 
jot or tittle of those rights shall be surrendered while life 
lasts, if I can prevent it; we will meet them in Bcsotia 
before they proceed to Attica, and we will not permit them 
to put their shirt of Xessus upon the back of American 
labor. We bid the Shy locks and money lords, here and 
hereafter, open and bitter defiance." 

Subsequently, before the final vote taken on the repeal 
allowing no favors to silver, Mr. Allen said; 

bill, 

I am sorry to see what may be called a backdown to some 
extent on the part of some of the advocates of free sitrer. 
If I had the experience in legislative work of some of the 
Senators who entertain the views I entertain, I should not 
only stay here until next summer but I would stay until 
next year, and I would continue to stay until the administration 
changed before this law should be unconditionally 
repealed, and before the great wrong which will be </seg>

            <seg id="p172">
380 


inflicted upon the American peopto by this unconditional 
repeal should be done to them and their Interest*. 

I say now. Mr. President, if there are any Senators in 
this chamber who have the true interests of the American 
people at heart, if there are enough of them who will raise 
the banner of the free ami unlimited coinage of silver and 
carry it to victory here, I Wlieve victory can be accomplished: 
and for one 1 will stay with that banner as long 
as my strength lasts, entirely regardless of the time it may 
take to fig-tit this battle. 

During the session of ninety days. Mr. Allen showed, by the 
introduction of resolutions of inquiry, and committee work, 
ability and fidelity, which had their culmination in the presentation 
of a resolution for arresting immigration "until a change 
in the labor market." But the adjourning fall of the Vice-President's 
gavel precluded action. 

First Kegilar Session Fifty-Third Congress 

Iais record made in The extra session indicated that in future 
was to be found among the careful workers in committees, 
d able debaters upon the floor of the senate. Early in the 
ision Senator Allen is found vigorously contesting with Sen&gt;rs 
Hoar of Massachusetts, Hunton of Virginia, and Faulkner 
West Virginia, in behalf of grantors in trust deeds, as against 
intees, who have generally had everything they desired. From 
merous debates running through several months, upon tariff 
luction. only a few items can be extracted, for want of space. 

POLICY 

Mr. Ai.lf.x: I say that the policy of taxing materials 
that go into the homes of this country is unwise. It should 
be the policy of a great and enlightened nation like this 
to refrain from taxing anything which is essential to the 
preservation of human life. The necessary homes which 
shelter our people from the blasts should be free from taxation, 
if it is possible to render them free. All the clothing 
and food necessary to protect and sustain our people 
should be free from taxation if possible, or at least, the 
lowest rate of taxes should be levied upon them. 

We use much rough lumber in the construction of fences 
and of outbuildings. These things are a necessity to the 
people of the State of Nebraska, and not only to them, but

[ desire to see the time come in this country when sugar

wealth where the ragmr l&gt;eet can be cultivated with profit, 
and one of the largest b— i sugar factories in the I'nited 
States is situated in the county in which I have the honor 
to reside. I do not believe that it is either wise on the part 
of this gnu Him ¦! to adopt the bounty system as a policy, 
nor do I believe the government has power under the constitution 
to encourage the development of anything by a 
svsteni of bounties. 

I recognize, however, that when the government has 
offered a bounty, and upon the strength of the offer contained 
in the statute an industry is developed which perhaps 
would not be developed but for the granting of the 
bounty, whether the government had the power or not, 
it certainly has morally no power to suddenly take the prop 
from under that industry and permit it to fall without any 
warning- of its purpose to eventually recede from the bounty 
system. 

Therefore when my colleague offered his amendment, 
which looked to a gradual reduction of the bounty system, 
until it would expire in 1905, dropping one-tenth each year, 
I voted for it. When he offered his amendment proposing 
to make the bounty 1 cent instead of 2 cents a pound, I 
voted for it, because both propositions looked to the gradual 
extinction of the bounty system, and because to so 
vote would not seriously wrench the industry which is being 
developed in my state today. 

PROTECTION. 

Xo, Mr. President, that is not the trouble with the Western 
farmer. The trouble with the Western fanner, in the 
first instance, is that he is eaten up by excessive rates of 
transportation. By the time he hauls his products across 
the mountains from the prairies of Nebraska fifteen hundred 
miles to Xew York market, he has consumed a valuable 
portion of the product of his field, and by the time he 
invests the money he gets out of the remainder in highly </seg>

            <seg id="p174">
382 


protected articles of consumption, he is left practically 
without any surplus for his year's labor. 

Give the farmer of the West an equal show in the race 
of life, and he does not ask protection from any government: 
give him an opportunity to buy in the open market, 
as he is compelled to sell in the open market; and control 
in his interest, and in the interest of the country at large 
to some extent, the question of transportation, and the 
farmer of the West does not stand in congress asking for 
protection or assistance at our hands. 

The debate, having elicited much asperity, evoked a spit 
reply to Mr. &lt; 'handler of New Hampshire. 

ited 

Mr. Ai.len: Mr. President. I desire to say in as polite 
language as I can to the Senator from New Hampshire 
that his statement or insinuation that there is any bargain 
between any person on this side of the chamber or in the 
chamber at all and myself is entirely untrue, and I am inclined 
to think that the Senator from New Hampshire knew 
it was untrue at the time he stated it. I have made no 
bargain. I propose to make no bargain. I propose to vote 
as 1 see fit upon this measure and upon every other measure 
that comes before the Senate. If when the pending 
bill is finally finished it is in my judgment a better measure 
than I he law now in force. I shall vote for it. If it is not. 
I shall vote against it. In that respect I desire to assure 
the Senator from New Hampshire that I am a free lance. 

I desire to state in this connection that it is none of the 
Senator's business how I propose to vote upon this or upon 
any other measure. I am not here to represent his views 
upon any question. I am sent here to oppose his views upon 
a majority of the questions that come before this body. 

Apparently upon the Napoleonic motto, that nothing had bcei 
accomplished while anything else remained to be done. Mr. Allen 
exceeded him former records and made the third or short sessioi 
of the 53rd Congress one conspicuous for thorough and incessan 
work. In a voluminous defense of the Populist party and it 
creed, he charged a union of the Democratic and Republican 
parties for the salvation of the country, as they understom 
salvation, and a unity of effort in charging the Populist part, 
as the advocate of vagaries and lack of leadership.

Mr. President— Sir, from a vote of a little over 1,000.000 
in 1392, the Populist party cast a vote of practically 2.000.000 
in 1894, an increase of almost 100 per cent., a greater vote 
than placed Mr. Lincoln in the White House in 1861. I thank 
God this moment that the lig-ht is beginning to dawn to-day 
upon the common people of this country out of the darkness 
and gloom and wrong and oppression through which 
they are and have been passing; that a ray of light shines 
over the broad expanse of this country, and in my judgment 
in 1896 both the old parties will practically pass out 
of power and this new party be brought into control of 
the government in all of its branches. 

I'ui-rr.iST creed 

I [is Populist creed, as given, included the coinage of both 
1 and silver at the ratio of lfi to 1, supplemented by a legal

SILVER COIN REDEMPTION. 

Finding $835,534.0** outstanding paper money, by law redeemable 
in coin, he argued that the Secretary of the Treasury 
should redeem in silver where it was evident that an attempt 
was being made to deplete the treasury of gold coin for the 
purpose of forcing the issuance of gold bonds, payable in gold, 
and to perpetuate a national debt, and enlarge the issue of 
national banks. In this spirit he denounced the issue of $500, 
000.000 bonds payable in fifty years. 

In 1S74, when there was a run upon the Treasury Department, 
when this country was experiencing a financial panic, 
the then Secretary of the Treasury issued $26,000,000 of 
treasury notes in excess of the number now in existence. </seg>

ALABAMA. 

As the session approached its close, he delivered a speech of 
n-at research and force, in favor of an investigation of 

Alaliama. ftllegiaf :iuti-ri-piihlican gorenuneat, and in the concluding 
sentences Bade plain his theory: 

I do not desire to be understood as saying that the States 
liavi- no riphts as States. Our government is a government 
of enumerated powers. If a power is not expressed in the 
constitution or is not necessarily implied to carry out some 
granted power, it does not exist, and cannot be exercised. 
Nor am I a believer, upon the other hand, in the doctrine 
that any state in the Union can say that the general government 
cannot pass its lines and protect its citizens. 
When this country guaranteed to every state in the Union 
a republican form of government, it carried with it the 
power, and the duty as well, to pass the lines of the state 
that might deny to a citizen any of the privileges or immunities 
of citizenship, and to protect him in their enjoyment. 


BENEDICTION. 

Near the close of the 53rd Congress, while protesting against 
appropriating money for the support of a "tin soldiery" in the- 
District of Columbia, at a time when benevolent citizens werevoluntarily 
aiding "drouth stricken people in the Northwest,"" 
Mr. Allen delivered the following graceful benediction: 

Sir. while I am on my feet speaking on this question I 
wish on behalf of a million and a quarter of as honest, 
loyal, and intelligent citizens as there are in the United 
States, who reside in ray own beloved commonwealth, to 
tender their thanks and mine for the splendid action of 
Georgia, Louisiana and other States, South and East, in 
bringing relief to a drouth-stricken people. Those people 
are struggling honestly and faithfully to build up this
