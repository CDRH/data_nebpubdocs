            <seg id="p003">SUMMARY 1. Three factors appear to be involved m the change of the kernel ■weight of corn which often results from fertilization by foreign or unrelated pollen. These are heterosis, size inheritance, and change m endosperm type. 2. The immediate effect of selflng. 10 commercial varieties of dent corn was an average reduction of 7 per cent m kernel weight. The pollen from selfed strains had essentially the same effect upon the kernel -weight as did pollen from open-pollinated varieties. Selfed strains of two varieties fully reduced by continued inbreed - ing responded to cross-pollination with an average increased kernel weight of 11.9 per cent. Strains of the same two varieties which had been subjected for a long period to two intermediate degrees of close-breeding were in - creased 8.5 and 3.7 per cent respectively m kernel weight by cross-' pollination as compared with 0.2 per cent increase for the original commercial corn. 3. These inbred, narrow-bred, broad-bred, and wind-pollinated strains which gave relative 2-year average kernel weight increases of 11.9, 8.5, 3.7, and '0.2 per cent, respectively, had given the correspond-' ing relative acre grain yields of 32, 78, 86, and 100 per cent. While inbred and close-bred strains varied individually m the amount of their response to foreign pollen, without exception they increased m kernel' weight. Such increases are due mainly to increased heterosis. 4. Nineteen inbred strains of two varieties whose kernel weights were increased an average of 10.1 per cent by cross-pollination m 1923 had their embryos, endosperms, and pericarps increased 11.8, 10.4, and 3.2 per cent, respectively. Sixteen narrow-bred strains whose kernels were increased an aver - age of 8.1 per cent had their embryos, endosperms, and pericarps t increased 9.1, 8.4, and 2.1 per cent. The kernels of 10 broad-bred strains increased an average of 3.5 per cent m weight due to foreign pollen, whereas the embryos, endo - sperms, and pericarps increased 3.6, 3.6, and 2.6 per cent, respectively. The embryos, endosperms, and pericarps of the same 2 commercial varieties, wind-pollinated, increased 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 per cent as com - pared with 0.2 per cent for the entire kernels. . 5. Of 210 combinations of foreign pollen on dent varieties, 2 decreased the kernel weight 2 to 3 per cent, 37 decreased 1 to 2 per cent, 51 decreased 1 per cent or less, 58 increased 1 per cent or less, 50 increased 1 to 2 per cent, 21 increased 2 to 3 per cent, and 3 increased 3 to 4 per cent. 6. Two hundred dent-by-dent combinations averaged 0.3 per cent increased kernel weight as an immediate effect of foreign pollen, 2 sweet-by-sweet crosses increased 2.0 per cent, 5 dent-by-flint crosses increased 0.3 per cent, 1 dent-by-pop cross decreased 1.3 per cent, </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 33 2 dent-by-sweet crosses decreased 1.2 per cent, 4 dent-by-flour crosses decreased 0.2 per cent, 4 sweet-by-dent crosses increased 21.5 per cent, 2 sweet-by-flour crosses increased 15.5 per cent, 1 sweet-by-pop cross increased 14.4 per cent, 1 sweet-by-waxy cross increased 20.2 per- cent, 1 flint-by-sweet cross decreased 1.4 per cent, 4 flint-by-dent crosses increased 2.3 per cent, 1 pop-by-pop cross increased 0.1 per cent, 1 pop-by-dent cross increased 3.0 per cent, and 2 waxy-by-dent crosses increased 5.6 per cent. 7. Considering the 200 dent variety combinations, an average of all those in which the pollen parents were either shallow-grained, small in plant size, or early-maturing showed that the hybrid and the pure kernels were of equal weight. In all combinations in which the pollen parent was either medium-deep, medium-large, or medium-late, the hybrid kernels averaged 0.2 per cent heavier than the pure. Deep - grained, large, and late-maturing varieties used as pollen parents increased the average kernel weight 0.9 per cent. Size inheritance would seem to be a factor in these results, but this effect apparently does not exceed approximately 1 per cent. 8. As an average for 2 years, the increased kernel weights result - ing from fertilization by foreign pollen equalled 2.4, 1.2, 6.9, and 1.9 per cent, respectively, for the Illinois High Protein, Low Protein, High Oil, and Low Oil strains of the Burr White variety. All 4 of these chemical strains had been subject to rather close breeding in connection with the long-continued type selection. This is shown by an average yield of 15 bushels per acre below that of two Fi hybrids between these strains. 9. Kernels of 10 varieties of dent corn which had given either slight decreases or very low increases in kernel weight as an immediate effect of foreign pollen were dissected to determine the relative weights of pure and hybrid kernel parts. The hybrid kernels averaged 0.5 per cent decrease in weight compared with the pure kernels, the hybrid embryos 1.6 per cent increase, the hybrid endosperms 0.9 per cent decrease, and the hybrid pericarps 0.2 per cent increase. In a similar test with 4 varieties which gave the relatively large increase of 3.1 per cent in kernel weight when cross-pollinated, the embryo increased 6.1 per cent, the endosperm 2.8 per cent, and the pericarp 1.1 per cent. When sweet corn (Golden Bantam) was fertilized by another sweet variety (Black Mexican), its kernels increased 1.3 per cent in weight. This was accompanied by an increase of 3.3 per cent in embryo weight and 0.6 per cent in endosperm weight. When the same variety was fertilized by a dent variety (U. S. Selection No. 133), the kernel weight increased 23.9 per cent, the endosperm 31 per cent, while the </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Immediate Effect of Gametic Relationship embryo was unaffected. These large increases in kernel and endosperm weights are due to a change in the composition of the endosperm as a xenia effect. 10. The moisture content of pure and hybrid kernels was obtained at the time of husking for 154 combinations on dent varieties. The extreme effects ranged from a decrease of 0.89 per cent to an increase of 0.9.9 per cent in the moisture content of the hybrid as compared with the pure kernels. All varieties averaged 0.09 per cent more moisture in the hybrid grain. Pure kernels on sweet corn ears had 7.2 per cent greater moisture content than hybrid kernels which had been fertilized by dent corn. Pure waxy kernels of the Chinese variety contained 2 per cent greater moisture than hybrid seed fertilized by dent corn. These differences obtained for both sweet and waxy varieties can probably be accounted for by changes in endosperm composition. The hybrid endosperms of both these types give a starch reaction with iodine. 11. A brief study in technique indicates that an experimental error in relative kernel weights ranging from 9 per cent too low to 16 per cent too high may result by the method of contrasting all the pure with the hybrid kernels on an ear when nearly all the hybrid kernels are located at either the tip or at the butt of the ear. The most reliable way to overcome place effects on the ear is to compare adjacent pure and hybrid kernels. 12. The relation between the effect of foreign pollen upon kernel weight as determined by these methods and upon acre yield has not been established. ■ It seems probable that the influence upon acre yields cannot exceed the effect upon kernel weights as established in these investigations and may be less. Experiments are under way to deter - mine this relationship. It may be concluded that in general no practical advantages are to be expected from the annual mixing of seed of commercial varieties of corn. Neither is the effect of cross-pollination which takes place in comparative experimental yield tests of commercial varieties which are similar in endosperm type of sufficient magnitude to be a serious disturbing element in arriving at correct conclusions. The kernel-weight increases of sweet varieties when fertilized by starchy types and of inbred strains and Fi hybrids between 2 pure lines when fertilized by foreign pollen are of sufficient magnitude to suggest that the acre yields may be affected thereby, in which event such yields may not accurately represent their yielding ability in com - parison with other corn. Serious yield effects due to source of pollen under field conditions seem unlikely in the case of double crosses and synthetic varieties because of their more complex constitution. </seg>

            <seg id="p007">The Immediate Effect of Gametic Relationship and of Parental Type upon the Kernel Weight of Corn T. A. KIESSELBACH This investigation to determine the relation of the kernel weight of corn to the source of pollen with which it was fertil - ized has been made to answer several questions of both prac - tical and technical interest: (1) To what extent is kernel weight affected m the current crop by the " breadth of breed - ing "or the gametic relationship? (2) What is the relation of the diversity of parental type to the immediate effect of foreign pollen upon the kernel weight of corn? (3) Is the immediate effect of cross-fertilization upon the kernel weight of sufficient importance to justify the annual mixing of seed corn of 2 or more varieties m order to increase yield under farm conditions? (4) Is the interpollination between varie - ties grown m comparative variety yield tests a material source of error by virtue of affecting kernel weight? (5) To what extent is an increased kernel weight, resulting as an immediate effect of cross-fertilization, an indicator of in - creased productivity for the first generation hybrid progeny over that of the ear-bearing parent grown pure? (6) In the case of increased kernel weight resulting as an immediate effect of cross-fertilization, what is the relative increase of the different parts of the kernel? (7) What is the immediate effect of cross-fertilization upon the maturity of the kernel as expressed by the relative moisture content? EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE When ears are pollinated by a mixture of pollen from two varieties or strains differing m endosperm or aleurone color, the kernels may be separated by color according to the pollen parent, thru the operation of xenia. This principle has been employed thruout m these investigations to deter - mine the relation of pollen source to kernel weight. The procedure has been to manipulate the pollination under con - trol conditions so that the variety parentage of each kernel could be established. This was done by mixing the pollen from two desired sorts and applying under control con - ditions by the bagging system to the receptive silks of covered ear shoots. Many of the varieties were planted at different" dates so that cross-pollination might be effected. Acknowledgment is made to Messrs; Glen C. Cook, T. C. H. Bayrhoffer and N. F. Peterson for assistance m making these determinations. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 33 An effort was made to produce 10 duplicate ears fertil - ized by any given combination of pollen. Due to some fail - ure in pollination a smaller number of well filled ears often resulted, as shown in the tables. Method studies in connec - tion with this work (reported on pages 60 to 64) have indi - cated that the effects of plant individuality may be largely overcome by the use of several ears rather than a single ear. All determinations of the immediate effect of foreign pollen upon kernel weight have been made by removing pure and hybrid kernels from the ear, in adjacent pairs only, there - by greatly reducing the experimental error which may result from place effect on the ear, as has been demonstrated in Table 35. Hybrid kernels were taken alternately on the butt and tip sides of the pure kernels to avoid the systematic error due to a gradual reduction in kernel size toward the tip of the ear. Comparisons are all based on moisture-free weights except as indicated where a special study of moisture content was made. cytology and genetics involved The cytological phenomena of xenia in the corn kernel are well understood. The reduction-division of chromosomes in the transition from archesporial to megaspore mother cell has been established for corn by Weatherwax and by cytological work in progress at the Nebraska Experiment Station. It is this cytological behavior which results in the genetic homology of the 8 nuclei developed in the embryo sac prior to fertilization. Because of this homology, identical inheritance is carried in the egg nucleus and in the two polar nuclei which enter by chance into the formation of the endosperm nucleus. The 2 sperm nuclei which fertilize the egg and endosperm nuclei respectively are also identical, reduction-division having previously taken place. In the double-fertilization of corn, therefore, the embryo and endo - sperm cells bear identical chromosome inheritance, with the exception that the endosperm cells have 3 sets of chromosomes (two from the mother side and one from the male) whereas the cells of the embryo have only two chromosome sets, one from either parent. Probably due to the double set of chromosomes received by the endosperm from the mother parent, the endosperm type of the female is dominant in the hybrid endosperm resulting from crossing any other type upon any of the starchy types including dent, flour, flint, and pop corn. In the case of sweet and waxy-endosperm varieties, the chemical and physical constitution of their </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Immediate Effect of Gametic Relationship endosperms is modified by fertilization with pollen from any of the starchy types. With such combinations the female endosperm type is not dominant. Investigations with corn at the Nebraska Experiment Sta - tion and elsewhere have indicated clearly that a heterozygous constitution is essential to maximum production. Any reduction in heterozygosity as . brought about by various degrees of inbreeding reduces the productiveness of the crop. 'Thus the grain yields of pure' lines developed by prolonged selfing of standard varieties are on an average only, about one-third as large as for the original broad-bred varieties. Yields range between these two extremes according to the extent of gametic relationship between the two parents. It is a vital part of this problem to determine the extent to which a similar relationship obtains in regard to the endo - sperm development. Where commercial varieties are crossed, the F_ progeny commonly tends to be intermediate in vegetative character between the two parents. Since the embryo and endosperm have received the same inheritance as the resultant plant, it becomes of interest to know whether the weight of the embryo and endosperm is influenced in like manner by diver - sity of parental types. the immediate effect of cross-fertilization upon the kernel weight of corn that has been inbred to various degrees During the years 1922 and 1923, the immediate effect of crossing upon kernel weight was studied for Hogue Yellow Dent and Nebraska White Prize corn which had been sub - ject to 4 degrees of continued close-breeding under control conditions. These 4 degrees of inbreeding may be designated as (1) selfed, (2) harrow-bred, (3) broad-bred, and (4) wind-pollinated commercial corn. All the Hogue strains have been subject to the designated treatments since 1910 and the Nebraska White Prize strains since 1913. Several strains of each degree have been used, each of which except the original commercial stock originated from a different ear-to-row strain. The inbred strains are practically homo - zygous, having been selfed annually for 10 or more years. The narrow-bred strains have each been continued annually by planting from a single ear that had been fertilized by a mixture of pollen from 15 sister plants of the same strain. The broad-bred strains had been developed by planting each </seg>

The wind-pollin - ated corn represents the original stock of both varieties grown annually in large fields and was normally heterozy - gous.

            <seg id="p012">Nebr. Agr. Exp.

            <seg id="p018">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 33 THE RELATIVE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF SELF AND CROSS - FERTILIZATION UPON THE KERNEL WEIGHTS OF COMMERCIAL VARIETIES OF CORN An investigation was made in 1922 to determine the im - mediate effect of selling upon the kernel weight of commercial varieties of dent corn. This involved a comparison of kernels that had been selfed with those that were fertilized by pollen from other plants of the same variety. An indirect method was necessitated since the two sets of kernels would have the same color and could not be distinguished from each other on the same ear. The procedure was to pollinate plants of a variety with a mixture of their own (self) pollen and pollen from another variety of a different endosperm color. A corresponding set of plants were pollinated with a mixture of pollen from the same foreign pollen variety and pollen from their own sister plants. The pure broad-bred kernels and the pure in - bred kernels were then compared in weight with the hybrid kernels paired with them. As an average for 10 varieties, the hybrid kernels weighed 0.7 per cent more than the broad-bred pure kernels, and 7.7 per cent more than the selfed kernels. By difference, we may conclude that a single selfing reduced the kernel weight 7.0 per cent compared with 0.7 per cent increase from cross - ing. The data are given in Table 9. This information may be of interest in connection with the use of first generation hybrid seed between two pure lines. In a field of corn planted entirely to such a hybrid the natural open-fertilization of all kernels is generally equivalent to a first inbreeding since all the plants have essentially the same genetic constitution. The cross pollination with un - related sorts which occurs extensively in the usual type of comparative field plat yield test prevents this reduction in kernel weight. The results from experimental test plats may, therefore, fail to give true indication of the comparative yielding ability of such F. hybrids and commercial varieties when grown separately under farm conditions. The need for thoro tests to establish the significance of these kernel weight effects in terms of acre yields is hereby suggested. </seg>

Using two standard local varieties as ear parents, a number of plants in each variety were pollinated with a mixture of pollen from either inbred or open-pollinated plants of another var - iety. By the method of kernel pairs, the pure and hybrid kernels could be compared. The results are recorded in Table 10.

Many of the earlier varieties were planted at two or more dates in order to permit the interchange of pollen. VARIATION IN VARIETAL RESPONSES The immediate effect of foreign. pollen upon 63 varieties of dent corn is listed in Tables 12 to 14 according to the earli - ness of the female parent. The "characteristics of these have been given in Table 11. Effect on Early Varieties. — Twenty-three early varieties (Table 12) ranged in their response to cross-fertilization from a decrease of 0.8 per cent to an increase of 2.8 per cent. Five varieties showed a slight decrease, 8 varieties less than 1 per cent increase, and 10 varieties between 1 and 2.8 per cent increase. The mean increase was 1.1 per cent. Effect on Medium-Late Varieties. — Twelve medium-late maturing varieties (Table 13) varied in their response to foreign pollen from a decrease of 0.9 per cent to an increase of 2.7 per cent. Four varieties showed a slight decrease, 1 variety less than 1 per cent increase, and 7 varieties between 1 and 2.7 per cent increase. The mean increase was 0.9 per cent. Effect on Late Varieties.— Some of these varieties were too late to mature normally under prevailing climatic con - ditions, but the results from pure and hybrid kernels should be comparable nevertheless. The immediate effect of cross - ing upon 28 late varieties (Table 14) varied from a decrease of 2.0 per Cent to an increase of 3.7 per cent. Sixteen var - ieties showed a slight decrease, 6 varieties less than 1 per cent increase, and 6 varieties between 1 and 3.7 per cent increase. The mean increase was 0.1 per cent. VARIETAL RESPONSE TO VARYING' POLLEN PARENT TYPE Twelve varieties of dent corn ranging from small, early - maturing, shallow-grained, smooth-eared types to large, late - maturing, deep-grained, rough-eared types, were grown in 5 row plats of 760 plants each. The comparative immediate effects of fertilization by a wide range of variety types was determined by control pollination for each of these 12 var - ieties. </seg>

            <seg id="p031">Immediate Effect of Gametic Relationship The results of these tests are reported in Tables 15 to 26. No very pronounced changes were noted in the kernel weights of these varieties as an immediate effect of fertilization by foreign pollen. The character of the pollen parent had very little influence upon the kernel weights. Hogue Yellow Dent used as the female parent in 24 crosses (Table 15) varied from a decrease of 1.7 per cent to an in - crease of 2.1 per cent as an immediate effect of foreign pollen, with a mean increase of 0.1 per cent. Improved Learning used as the female parent in 13 crosses (Table 16) ranged from a decrease of 1.2 per cent to an increase of 2.2 per cent with an average increase of 0.7 per cent. Iowa Gold Mine ranged in 15 different crosses (Table 17) from a decrease of 1.5 per cent to an increase of 2.3 per cent, with a mean increase of 1.0 per cent. University No. 3 used as the female parent in 10 crosses (Table 18) ranged from an increase of 0.2 per cent to an increase of 2.4 per cent with a mean increase of 1.2 per cent as an immediate effect of fertilization by foreign pollen. U. S. Selection No. 133 varied in 5 crosses (Table 19) from a decrease of 0.4 per cent to an increase of 1.4 per cent, and gave a mean increase of 0.4 per cent. Reid Yellow Dent figured as the ear bearing parent in 12 crosses (Table 20). The immediate effect of foreign pollen ranged from a decrease of 1.3 per cent to an increase of 2.9 per cent and gave a mean increase of 0.7 per cent. Nebraska White Prize was used as the female parent in 18 crosses (Table 21). The results varied from a decrease of 2.0 per cent to an increase of 2.5 per cent, with a mean de - crease of 0.5 per cent. Substation White varied in 20 different crosses (Table 22) from a decrease of 1.6 per cent to. an increase of 1.8 per cent, and gave a mean increase of 0.1 per cent.

            <seg id="p044">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 33 Marteens White Dent was used as the ear bearing parent in 13 crosses (Table 25). The range in response to foreign pollen was from a decrease of 1.8 per cent to an increase of 1.7 per cent. The average weight of the hybrid kernels was the same as for the pure.

            <seg id="p050">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 33 the immediate effect of foreign pollen upon the kernel weight of various ear type selections of standard dent varieties Composite samples of rough- and smooth-ear types were selected from the ordinary Hogue Yellow Dent and Nebraska White Prize varieties and each type was grown in field plats in 1922. Reciprocal type crosses were made between the 2 varieties and the results are reported in Table 30. As an average for both varieties the kernel weights of rough ears were increased 0.1 per cent when they were fertilized by foreign pollen from smooth ears. Rough ears fertilized with pollen from foreign rough types increased 0.4 per cent in kernel weight. Smooth ears fertilized with pollen from unrelated smooth ears responded with an increased kernel weight of 0.3 per cent. The kernels of smooth ears increased 0.9 per cent in weight when fertilized by pollen from rough ear types. Thus no striking immediate effect is apparent from crossing unlike ear types which have been selected for but a single year. THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF FOREIGN POLLEN UPON THE KERNEL WEIGHT OF CORN THAT HAS UNDERGONE PROLONGED RESTRICTED TYPE SELECTION The High and Low Protein and High and Low Oil Selec - tions of the Burr White variety were obtained from the Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station and studied as to their kernel weight response to fertilization by foreign dent pollen during the two years 1922 and 1923. These strains have been subject to such close selection for chemical com - position that their heterozygosity has been reduced. This is indicated by a comparative yield test of these strains (Table 31) and 2 F. hybrids between them in 1923. The 4 chemical strains averaged 52.3 bushels per acre compared with 67 bushels for the 2 hybrids. These 2 F_ hybrids, viz, High x Low Protein and High x Low Oil, responded to foreign pollen in 1923 by the respec - tive increases of 0.7 and 0.5 per cent in kernel weight. In comparison the corresponding kernel-weight increases result - ing from fertilization by foreign pollen were 2.6, 1.2, 9.8, and 1.4 per cent, respectively, for the High Protein, Low Protein, High Oil, and Low Oil strains.

As an average for the 2 years, the increased kernel weights resulting from fertilization by foreign pollen equalled 2.4, 1.2, 6.9, and 1.9 per cent, respectively, for the High Protein, Low Protein, High Oil, and Low Oil strains. THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF FOREIGN POLLEN UPON KERNEL WEIGHT WHEN VARIOUS ENDOSPERM TYPES ARE CROSSED The immediate effect upon kernel weight from cross-fertil - ization between various endosperm types is shown in Table 32 and is summarized in Table 33. The result may be stated as follows: 200 dent-by-dent crosses increased 0.3 per cent; 2 sweet-by-sweet crosses increased 2.0 per cent; 5 dent-by - flint crosses increased 0.3 per cent; 1 dent-by-pop cross de - creased 1.3 per cent; 2 dent-by-sweet crosses decreased 1.2 per cent; 4 dent-by-flour crosses decreased 0.2 per cent; 4 sweet-by-dent crosses increased 21.5 per cent; 2 sweet-by - flour crosses increased 15.5 per cent; 1 sweet-by-pop cross increased 14.4 per cent ; 1 sweet-by-waxy cross increased 20.2 per cent; 1 flint-by-sweet cross decreased 1.4 per cent; 4 flint-by-dent crosses increased 2.3 per cent; 1 pop-by-pop cross increased 0.1 per cent; 1 pop-by-dent increased 3.0 per cent ; 2 waxy-by-dent crosses increased 5.6 per cent. Most of these kernel-weight effects resulting from cross - fertilization are to be accounted for by either (1) a change in heterosis, (2) a slight tendency for the embryo and endo - sperm in the F_ condition to assume an intermediate growth between the two parental varieties, or (3) a change in endo - sperm type. The first 2 of these factors may account for all of these changes in weight except in the case of sweet and perhaps waxy varieties crossed by other endosperm types. ■When sweet kernels are fertilized by starchy types, the starch character is dominant and results in starchy kernels of greater weight. The progressive precipitation of carbohy - drates in the starchy kernel until maturity is reached does not occur to the same extent in pure sweet kernels. The sugars of pure sweet corn remain in solution to a greater extent in sweet kernels until cured and therefore less sub - stance can be translocated into such kernels by osmosis than in the case of a starchy kernel. This greater osmotic intake and storage of substance is very apparent in mature grain. </seg>

From its behavior in these rather limited tests the Chinese" or waxy type of endosperm appears to be somewhat inter - mediate between that of starchy and sweet corn. The eryth - rodextrin endosperm of this type has undergone greater in - crease than dent corn but less than sweet corn when crossed with starchy corn. THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF CROSS-FERTILIZATION UPON THE RELATIVE WEIGHTS OF THE KERNEL PARTS OF COMMERCIAL VARIETIES OF CORN The relative weights of kernel, embryo, endosperm, and pericarp were determined in 1922 for both pure and hybrid kernels of a number of variety combinations. Table 34. Ten combinations between dent varieties which showed very little response to foreign pollen averaged a 0.5 per cent; reduction in kernel weight. For these varieties the embryo . averaged 1.6 per cent increase, the endosperm 0.9 per cent decrease, and the pericarp 0.2 per cent increase. Four variety combinations of dent corn which showed a relatively large response as an immediate effect of foreign pollen averaged 3.1 per cent increase in kernel weight. The embryo, endosperm, and pericarp increased respectively 6.1, 2.8, and 1.1 per cent. These data suggest that for these varieties which lacked somewhat in heterozygosity the embryo responded more than the endosperm. Since the pericarp is part of the mother plant and is not subject to cross-fertilization, its slight increase in weight is not due to change in genetic constitution but is simply an accompanying growth correlation. GRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF SEVERAL OUTSTANDING RESULTS A number of important determinations summarized in Tables 5, 8, 28, 33, and 34 are shown graphically in charts 1, 2, and 3.

The correspond - ing pure kernel weights ot the ear-bearing parents were 100 per cent in ail casea. Data taken from Tables S and 33. relative moisture content of PURE AND ' HYBRID KERNELS The moisture content was determined at husking time for the pure and hybrid kernels of many of the variety combina - tions of dent corn reported in Tables 12 to 26. The results are variable, ranging from a reduction of 0.89 per cent to an increase of 0.99 per cent. As an average for 154 combina - tions, the hybrid kernels contained .09 per cent more mois - ture than the pure. Probably no importance should be attached to this slight difference as it may easily fall within the limits of experimental error. On the other hand, it was found that an average of 4 sweet varieties fertilized by a mixture of their own and dent pollen contained 7.2 per cent more water at husking time in the" pure sweet than in the hybrid starchy kernels on the same ears. This is definitely due to the difference in the chemical nature of the sweet and starchy endosperm types. Thru the continued precipitation of starch in the starchy kernels, the moisture is carried from the grain at a more rapid rate by </seg>

One is an error due to the place effect on the ear and the other is individuality of ears in their reaction to for - eign pollen.

Data taken from Tables 8 and 84. • Since all of the duplicate ears in any variety combination did not always have the same number of kernel pairs, a ques - tion arises whether results are as reliable when the kernels from the several ears are shelled and weighed in composite . as when the calculations are made for each ear individually. If the latter practice is followed, the probable error may be calculated for each varietal difference. It appears from these comparative studies (Table 36) to be reasonably satisfactory to use the method of removing in composite all kernel pairs | from all of the ears tested. </seg>

THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF CROSSING UPON THE ENDO - SPERM CHARACTER AND THE COLOR OF VARIOUS CORN TYPES Incidental to the immediate effect of foreign pollen studies in relation to kernel weight, opportunity was offered to observe the location of color in the kernels of different var - ieties and to study the color inheritance in hybridization. The results are given in detail in Table 37. The color of corn kernels is due either to the color of the pericarp or to the endosperm color showing thru the translu - cent pericarp or to a combination of these causes. The peri - carp color is not affected by xenia. When the pericarp is colorless, or nearly so, the kernel color is mainly due to that of the endosperm. Yellow endosperm pigments were found to occur in the aleurone layer and in the horny starch, while blue pigments were confined entirely to the aleurone layer. When a white corn is pollinated with pollen from corn with a yellow or blue aleurone layer the result is pale yellow or pale blue kernels. Such crossed blue kernels often vary greatly in color. When yellow and blue color are present together the </seg>

            <seg id="p067">Immediate Effect of Gametic Relationship yellow may be obscured or appear on parts of the kernel, as in the cap. Crossed yellow kernels are often white-capped, the rest of the kernel being yellow. Even a red pericarp is somewhat translucent so that a blue aleurone layer under it makes a darker red kernel than does a white or yellow aleurone layer. The texture of and chemical nature of the • endosperm also affect the kernel color; thus white sweet corn when ripe has a dull greyish color. HISTORICAL Ten publications by various investigators have appeared concerning the immediate effects of foreign pollen upon kernel weight. Their results may be summarized chrono - logically as follows: The first record bearing upon this problem was that of McCleur (7) in 1892. Five- ears of sweet corn had been pollinated by a mixture of pollen from sweet and dent var - ieties, resulting in the occurrence of both pure sweet and hybrid kernels upon the same ear. The hybrid kernels aver - aged 24.2 per cent heavier than the pure. These data corre - spond very closely to those obtained at the Nebraska Experi - ment Station. From McCleur's results and other observations Smith (9) concluded in 1909 that comparative yields in corn variety tests were ordinarily not seriously affected by cross - pollination except in the case of sweet corn which should be tested in the absence of pollen from dent corn. Collins (2) was next to report, in 1909. An ear of the Chinese variety, which is characterized by a waxy endosperm consisting largely of erythrodextrin, gave an increased kernel weight of 16 per cent for hybrid over pure kernels when pollinated with a mixture of pollen from Chinese and dent corn. This is approximately double the increase secured with this variety in the Nebraska experiments. Roberts (8) stated in 1912 that a large increased kernel weight was obtained from pollinating Chinese corn by an American dent variety but did not give the amount of in - crease. More extensive and detailed data bearing upon this problem were reported by Collins and Kempton (3) in 1913. Eleven ears representing 4 varieties were fertilized with pollen mixtures to produce both pure and hybrid kernels on each ear. The pure kernels on 6 of the ears were produced by selfing and the other 5 thru pollination by sister plants. The hybrid kernels averaged 8.7 per cent heavier than the sib - pollinated pure kernels and 12.9 per cent heavier than the* selfed kernels. These are materially greater average differ- </seg>
            <seg id="p068">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 33 ences than were obtained in corresponding Nebraska tests for variety crosses. All pure and hybrid kernels on the ears were compared for weight. The immediate effect of cross-fertilization upon the kernel weight was reported by Wolfe (10), in 1915 for 28 variety combinations involving 37 ears. His procedure was to have each ear pollinated by mixtures of sib- and foreign-variety pollen. All pure and hybrid kernels on each ear were con - trasted for average kernel weight. His results indicate variety responses ranging from 13.45 per cent decrease to 16.04 per cent increase in kernel weight. These are far greater effects than obtained in similar tests with commercial varieties at the Nebraska Experiment Station. The wide variation may doubtless be accounted for in part at least by error due to place effect of the kernels on the ears. Carrier ( 1 ) drew conclusions in 1919 from some of his own and Wolfe's investigations to the effect that there is an in - crease in kernel weight due to the stimulus of foreign pollen and that testing of varieties in adjoining plats is unreliable because of cross-pollination. This author proposes that some elaborate method of variety testing which eliminates cross - pollination would be justified. Such a conclusion is not sup - ported by the Nebraska data in the case of ordinary commer - cial field varieties. It would seem to apply, however, in the case of sweet and waxy varieties subject to pollination by other endosperm types and also to inbred and close-bred strains and to F 1 hybrids between 2 pure lines. No substitute method of comparing the yield of such corn has been pro - posed or seems readily available. The relation between yield per acre and kernel-weight effects due to cross pollination has not been determined but merits investigation. In 1920, East and Jones (4) reported the immediate for - eign pollen effects upon kernel weight for 16 plants each of Illinois Low Protein and Stadmuller High Protein corn reciprocally pollinated. The individual plants of each variety were pollinated with a mixture of their own pollen and that from a plant of the opposite variety. The hybrid kernels averaged 19.7 per cent heavier than the selfed. The writer (5) reported several investigations in 1922 con - cerning the immediate response of commercial varieties and inbred strains to foreign pollen. The results are quite in agreement with the more extensive tests since conducted. In a 5-year test an increase of 0.32 per cent was secured for the hybrid kernels on wind fertilized ears grown in a field of commercial Hogue Yellow Dent and partially fertilized by </seg>
            <seg id="p069">Immediate Effect of Gametic Relationship pollen from an adjoining field of Nebraska White Prize. The immediate effect of crossing on kernel weight varied in the different years from an increase of 1.8 per cent to a decrease of .0.7 per cent. About 200 ears were represented in this test each year. In 1921 seven crosses between commercial • varieties showed an average increase of 0.22 per cent from foreign pollen, ranging from an increase of 1.3 per cent to a decrease of 1.6 per cent. In the same year 30 ears of selfed strains of 2 varieties of dent corn were partly fertilized with composite pollen of sister plants from their own strains and partly by foreign dent pollen. Crossing in - creased the average kernel weight 11.2 per cent. Kiesselbach and Cook (6) published a brief summary in 1924 of some of the varietal and selfed line responses to for - eign pollen which are presented at greater length in this bulletin. literature cited 1.
