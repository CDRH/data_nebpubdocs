After that, you can take any action you wish in regard to rescinding any action heretofore taken. If e proper you should adopt them If not, amend them, and then adopt them.

The motion was adopted. Dr. Peters was introduced, and spoke as follow REMARKS OF I'k 1 Ladies and Gentlemen, and Mr. President It is a pleasure to speak to you al this taw i many &lt;&gt;' been at the farm during the week, and ha me of the other meetings that have been going on there ever sino rtainly have had a splendid gathering and I know you have had a very p week here at the show. I hope this 11 be a very profitable une to vou all. I b really </seg>
            <seg id="p007">something knew, hut I &lt;lo come before vou with a plea for something we need, and we need the association's help. As you have been meeting here in Lincoln, and your retaries have asked the I'niversit) to furnish you something in regard to diseases „' other lines, I want to draw attention to the fact that the Unii g all it can up to a certain measure. For instance, we have on our in te force some able speakers on topics of poultry. They are doing a great deal of missionerv work, but I c mostly work rk, that they are doing all over the state. 1 ne othe thing. We need certain facilities on the farm along the line of feeding instance the f-ed of the poultry for experiment w &gt;rk Ins not been done to any extent in the west, th»t is in our st.ition. There are other things be s feeding care, anil breeding of these animals that probably vou wouW like us to take up. I think ■ wing out on the farm, th t thing of this kind will be done, and I am sure that the way you arc I ing in attendance and in the meetings that the R&lt; their way clear to establish some good work at the farm to take up some o these difficult problems that you come here ti r. t mean to My, that in the di^ase alone we are pretty well equipped Take our department and we arc trying to do a gotxi deal of work for but some of the other branches of this work are not so well represented and no doubt in the near future they will be taken up. It has been th policy of the authorities out there that whenever thev hue taken up branc work, that if they could see their way clear to make this branch as goot and as strong as any other branch of the institution, they would do so And furthermore, not to duplicate the work of any other station. make it as strong as any other station or better. That is why we are hol( ing off. Our legislature at the la- s have been very liberal wit'.. and we hope we have shown them that it was not a mistake to be libera with us. We hope now that in the near future when the next legislature is, that we can help your department more than some others have bee I do not want to go int&lt; You know that better than I do. You also know that you need som.* good help. The fanners and the breeders that are here tonight cannot do this experiment work. Let me speak to you about another feature, and that is this: I would commend to ever | ou that if you want the poultry industry to flourish in our state, if you want this he strongt- ou can have in the state, you cannot do any better work than to try and lave a farmers institute ir. your town, It would not ■ iifference if ou had it ten or fifteen miles away, hut try and have an in id then rrange the details of that institute, trying to have poultry represented. We id that the institute is the best way of disseminating this knowledge when we have good poultry topics on the program at the institute. I have noticed n my ten years experience o lat whenever there is &gt;ouHr% '" always nave th ;)le things are mraand attent. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 So, I commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, to try ami have an ute and help us along to build up this strong industry that can do so much Nebraska, lemen, it is not only the poultry I ess that we « interested in, which is all right, but we would lave you interested in all our other branches. We would like to have ; our farm and look us all over. For that re. i son, we are very hopeful to ijood many tli m, and hope you will co-operate with us. 1 assure you ladies and gentlemen, that if you had not at the present time the very elaborate plants that you would like us to have, 1 feel sure that the authori: in as they cut, will install that and make it the strongest one that we have in the west. I know that you have I deal of business on hand this evening, and in closing I wish to welcome \ou at the State Farm; further more that whenever my department or the entire department, at the Farm can be of any service to any one of you, kindly command us. I thank you for your kind attention. President : It is needless for me to introduce address vou. to vou Mrs. Mtllette, who wil Mrs. Mellette: Mr. President nd Gentlerr lege that I have been invited to speak m sure it is somewhat of a privi - a few words to you.

T privilege among you, I went home and said to our poultry association, I have had the privilege of meeting with 150 live poultry men, and I said that is an exper - ience fit for anyone. they have poultry shows th have been at work on these same lines, and we expect when the legislature in. that «. i I applau- I live 5280 fee le level of the sea It is a very nervous climate, nd I liki nto a lower altitude.

When I got there 1 receh etter from your President at the hands of vour Secretary, saying, "You are member of the Nebraska Sta'e Poultry Association." May be yon ihink I lid not feel at home! I felt as if I had been given the liberty of the t. So far 1 have enjoyed every minute of my stay among you. As is dor. mown to the most of you I edit and publish a poultry paper out in Dei n the 15th day of January, 1903, I have written 2008 subscriptio: hat papt lily understand thit I have had a lot of tall o do 1 laughter. 1 From the fact that for tin I have been a poul - •e well understood that I do a lot of writing, and if I :ig that I have written or said heretofore, I </seg>

So give me your indulgence this evening. -oinetimes I get weary in the work of this subscript -.-;, and i exceeding great pleasure to occasionally run across some one who II like your work, I like your paper, it helps me." Then I feel tha Quid rather be the editor of a poultry paper, than to be the Queen of the mibal Islands. I am an enthusiast in this work. Taking into considers t the fact that there is no claim when . t it is bounded by altitude or latitude ; it? You cannot always tell the people who raise poultry. Some one s to me, "Can you pick out the people who raise poultry, don't t like a hajseed?" I said, no. I remember at one time in Dallas, at th te Fair, I was looking at a lad&gt; n, and I was hesit i ether to say anything to them, ar.&lt; ng said tome perh ter speak. And I said, do j And then they told m whole story. They said we wan: 1 there is no reason y a poultry woman, or women, should not dress well, as well as They asked me, do you think the- money in pou. id, if I could onlv have what I could make, or if I could make mv thes I would go at it. I said I have been a poultry woman all these rs, and I have dressed in flowing silk and satin. ; winter at Little Rock, I walked up to a gentleman ■ I always crack smile in mv work of subscription — (laughter) I you raise chickens? 'Raise chickens?" I worship chickens. Poultry culture has saved me from the grave. Th into our parlor every chickens. Last summer when in Iowa at the State . dressed in tailor wn. She looked swell. I thought I would just isk her if she raised chickens, and she said, ' And she told me her story.

She expected to go to work in a feed store at J»4.oo a week, and that &gt;oor little girl wanted a room. The lady said you will have to pay in ad - ance. I don't know who you are. Yon could go at any tinn board bill would he left unpaid. She had no money. She said I think 1 can ind a friend of mine in the city tonight, and I will come back." She did ot come back, but mind you she was to have paid for that room without oard at $ 3.00 a week . Suppose instead of that she had been educated in &gt;oultry culture; that she had been at a place where there was such associa - ions of poultry ; If she had ever had anything of that kin • to her mind don't you suppose she would have been at home raising chickens, rather lan seeking to k in a feed store at $4 00 a week. It would have &gt;een far better for her. That is one of the reasons why I am enthusi when I k° home the chi </seg>

            <seg id="p011">11 Before closing I would like to make a plea for universal poultry culture. b a merchant was speaking with me ai that when I come home of an evening, I ha\ • and I put him on my hand and I take him in the house, and he wi y wife don't like eh chickens.' I said there are lots of women wli ike that know when they are well off. She finds fault because there are li • in this world that men see that are not so ini ■ &gt;f women say to me, ( )ne time I gave my hus! But now, when I am gone away he writes, "it is well with us and the chickens, it is well with u 'ine. \V« or we ■ \nd I feel contented, and I know that tht Yes I feel perfectly content, and I know that my birds are : care c Ry dear friends, if vour wives lovt t always be s. ,ey are eating their heads off. \V Before closing I would like to say one more word, an*! (led the Kansas City Show, and I attended the Topeka show. At the a show the president of the K . Club w ind he got speech. He we expect to have t! I of the &gt;: river. There is no reason why we should not, because we have the building. We have paid alt our prem - iis year, and we are g 'ing to have more premiums next year. Then the Topeka President got up and said, we will have the biggest show &gt;u all here. Somebody from Lincoln said, we are going to have the biggest shov.. and w&lt; I all to be there. I hope this recipr feeling will continue forever. I thank you for your attentiou. i appl.t Ki had hoped to have been entertained this evening by an r, but Dr. Peters has notified us that the speaker t ar- You will therefore pass to the next order of business as '. is unfinished business, and we will now listen to the report &lt;&gt; rkport 01 B relieve the president has no report to make, as he has n association, no moneys have come into his hat ing to the aaao - , and it would be well therefore to call upon the officers of the aasocia - rtao have received and disbursed the funds of the association.

It will be between $400 and $500 he says. The il&lt;x)r receipts wl eft the show room, lacked 1 at 10 cents &lt; "he work of the secretary during the pa^ u heavy in one dir - n. A great many inquiries have been made during the past year in regard to the score of the birds of our exhibitors last year. I do not k iy time when so many inquiries have l&gt;een received from this and other tates in regard to verification of the published poultry papers re not printi: re of pens and birds beyond the I nod, but e papers were kind to us because I furnished typewritten copies complete f the score, and I I it many letters asking to verify figures as printed, "nfortunatelv, one paper omitted one class I do not know why or hey came to do it, because their paper had the Ml tly. The nquiries to my mind that an ei makes a mistake in his newspaper if he does Dot publish the score. The work of the association has been carried on according to our rule* and regulations, as far as [ know. I would like to talk a little whil, the lines of some Mrs. Mellette, if I might be permitted. l Voice; Yes, go ahe; ; I would like to tell one incident that occurred i'ueblo the other iay. I went into the dining room for dinner, and a stranger to me sit - ing at the table, asked if I lived in Nebraska, I replied that I did. He ■u know Ji knew Judge Norval. He hey tell me that the Judge has retired from the supreme bench and lecame a poultr He snid. can you tell me the differ - nce between Ji: brown leghorn hen? I said, no, I did not know that I could. V. ,id the Judge can lav an egg on a red hot md not burn his feet; but the brown leghorn hen can't, (laughter. 1 The Judges having retired from the bench I might mention another in - cident. About five we ;ie of the members of the Supreme bench went home one evening, ami &lt;t the door by his granddaughter, at once engaged in a conversation. And in the talk she says. Grandpa are a judge, are you? And he says, yes. Well, Grandpa I want to ask -;e to have you decide it as a lodge. If I Ol peacock, and that ; into my 1 yard an&gt; an 1. egg would that be? The Grandfather, Supreme Judge, was lighted to hear and learn of the judicial turn of the little girl's mind, and he said, why that would be your egg. But Grandpa, if you went over the fence to get that eg lie owner of the yard arrest you for trespass, might he not? Grandpa says yes, yes, he might. She says. Grandpa, but it ever occur to you that that peacock could never lay an egg?i laugh Mrs. Mellette this evening spoke about art. This reminds me that when we were in Denver, stopping at the hotel, there were several there. And they were commenting about their respective abiliti. painted a picture of an icicle, and it was so natural and life like that </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 K landlady hung it up in her refrigerator to keep our victuals cool, ther one said, this reminds me of an old farmer who said, I can't paint, I can draw. I drawed a picture of one of my barred Rock hens, and it natural and looked so life like that when I dropped it into the -.et, there she laid.

The ■ hat the )iesident and secretary be instructed to file th^se amendments with tl: etary of State. I suppose the association wanted to take proper an'! teps to amend its articles of incorporation, and lieing somewhat of urn of mind. I consulted the statutes of our state, of which I had sotri' amiliarity. and reached the conclusion that the filing of these articlt - he Secretary of State, without publication of them as provided by statute, also the filing of them in the office of the county clerk, would be Consequently the matter of filing these amended articles jf incorp. las been deferred leaving it for consideration whether publication shal! be made. So these amended articles of incorporation have not been filed, and t is now open for such further direction and acti • deem proper to give it. Mr. Armstrun Mr. President, is it within the order of business to ask you a qut in regard to the articles of incorporation, if any action be taken whether or not it ought to come under the head of new business, which is the eighth order of busim President If there are not objections we will pass this and take it up later Mr. Armstrong: I would like to ask if there is any member present who was at the sent i - annual meeting, who offered these resolutions to change the by-law» and constitution, and if there is any such member here, I would like to know what the object was, what reason he had for wishing to change these by-lawt at the time when, as I understand, there were but a few members of the assoc - iation present, and thus wiping out some of the fundamental principles of • &gt;ciation. If there is any such member present, I would like f&lt; to give his reasons for so doing. Mr. Larson: I have been speaking with the members of the association in regard to this matter, and they seem to be united in thinking that the association would not be benefited by this change; and I move that we rescind the pro - posed amendment. Mr. Seabrook: I move that the proposed change adopted at the semi-annual meeting be not published nor filed. Secretary Ludden The proper motion would be to rescind the motion authorizing the presi - dent and secretary to file them. Mr. Seabrook I am ready to make that kind of a motion, but when there is a good way to kill it without slapping anybody in the face, I always like to take the better course. If those men sincerely believed that that action would be for </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 he good of the association it would be different. But we come up now to he annual meeting, wbeie there are a larger number of members pi and we conclude that it is not for the g &gt;ciation to have that change made. The change cannot be made until they are published, and the changed articles filed. I am perfectly willing to adopt Mr. Ludden tion, but I want to iio it without letting the other people feel tha' a endeavoring to offend them. President : There will be no necessity of filing the by-laws wfth the Secretai te, or publishing the aiHendment to the articles of incorporation. Mr. Foss. I would like to hear from those wl»o moved those resolutions. Mr. Lewelling. If you will refer to pay 4 the report of 1901, you wtl hat 'his matter came up at that time before this body, which had been re - erred to a committee — if the members of this association would r&lt; reports they would be benefited — on these two pages you will find that re - »rt. I don't know as it is necessary to read the whole of it, but I will read the names of the committee, T. L. Norval. C. M. Lewelling, L. \V. Garoutte, Albert Lemon and J. S. Bishop. I never heard of it. President This matter was submitted at that time, and if the chair remembers correctlv, the action of the committee was adopted. Then the same identi - cal proposition that was adopted at the Mate fair grounds was what . eluded in our report which was rejected. Mr. Lewelling: We have now a board composed of nine members. The State board of agriculture which does ten times as much business as we do, tr their lmsiness with a board of five members. I do know that five men can re busine~- -atisfactory as nine. There are some men who want positions on the board for the sake of holding a little office, and possibly it may help them some. I am glad to see them hold it, but it is better to trust the business of this association U&gt; a board of five men. than to encumber the a.sso nation with nine men. I am in 4 the resolution. I am not in favor of any politics in this If politics comes in this association it will hurt. There is no position within the gift of this association that it can give to me again. You have honored me, and I thank vou for it, and now just please let me out and retire me. I don't want any pay to be retired on either. Mr. Haven: I am in favor of the resolution as adopted at the semi-annual meeting. I think the board is entirely too large, and attended with too much expense. Mr. Seabrook. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">17 The board can be much better represented by five members, which be plenty large enough to handle the business of the association, and it would save the association a Rood many dollars during the year. I there - fore, heartily approve of the resolution. Mr. I I have been on this board one year now. I have not drawn one cent from the appropriation, at any board meeting. Furthermore, it is u - the show for members to have their expenses paid. I am willing to take them, but I have been working every minute since I came into the show ring. I think I am worth my expenses. In case you were to hire some per - sons thev would want more than their expenses. I am sure. Mr. Lewelling It is a fact that if you elect officers now they will take their places in the morning, or Friday forenoon. The settlement has not been made for this show, and your secretary is not ready to turn over his business. You are swapping horses in the middle of thf stream. If the resolution is adopttd under that arrangement the settlement is made and there is plenty of time to go ahead and prepare the premiu- The officers would hold over until next semi-annual meeting after the and everything would be settled up ready to go ahead again. Mr. Seabrook: That last statement in my judgment, is the only thing that has been said favorable to this change. I am willing to concede that that is a reason - able excuse or reason why that change should be made. I think the matter of saving expense is not of sufficient magnitude to entitle it to consider In my judgment it offsets that which these gentlemen have just brought out, and that can be remedied very easily, I think. The new take their potition until after th^ c-ose of this show and everything settled up. But the semi-annual meeting is always very slimly attended, as far as my experience goes. The stockholders do not get out in numbers as they do at the annual meeting. I dont think any one ever saw a half as many holders at the semi-annual meeting as there are here tonight, If the time ever comes when we don't get that state aid to keep this association then the stockholders will have something else to do. It seems to me that we ought to have a majorit\ of the stockholders represented as nearly as we can. I appreciate what Mr. Lewelling said in regard to the officers holding over from one show to another, or having the entire management of the show in the hands of one set of officers. 1 believe that can be provii . but in my judgment the annual meeting is by all odds the best time to select officers. Mr. Armstrong I have been a member of the association for a number of years, and can remember when we acted under the other by-laws, and had the business of the association closed up as soon as the show was over. I believe this can be done again. To my certain knowledge covering a period of fifteen years the senii-anual meeting is the worst time for the selection of new officers. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 If you will go back to your annual report \ou will see that the busiiji closed up by each set of officers at the cl.se of the show before the books were turned over. This can be done again now. I kn i* that from ihree to twelve is about as large an attendance as we ever get at the semi-annual meeting. Seer. I would say this, that when Mr. Arm- surer the b to hold over from 2 weeks to I'nder the new rules adopted by the association the new officers will take their places tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock, and the old officers will retire. Whoever is elected secretary will have the books turned over to him tomorrow whether there has bee %i dollar of premium paid or fifty cents. That is the way they were turned over to me. The old treasurer did not pay a dollar out. I.ook at Mr. Lemen's rei&gt;ort. Mr. K. O. Spencer did not pay a single dollar out. He refused. He turned the 1 r to Mr. Lenten with the money, and he had to commence at that point to make out his report. We c &gt;mmcnced to pay out premiums. I had even thin r the next secretary. 1 go to work and make up 1 it he has a mind to. It used to be thirty but then • 1 it. Mr. Arms' Were not vou the man who offered that resolution Mr. Ludden sir, I was not there so I could not have offered it Mr. Pegler: That was changed during my last term. It was fifteen years I think when it was changed. I think it worked satisfactorily. Mr. Towelling: Gentlemen, there is another little matter of business that perhaps we have overlooked. We have great confidence in both our secretary and treas - urer, but who ever is elected as their - will be required to give a bond in the sum of one thousand dollars, and two thousand dollars. We have had a test case in Nebraska with regard to bonds and in order to make them stick, they must be approved all right. Our law requires that we have those bonds properly approved, i nd it must be done by the board. Two years ago I know there was a board meeting called for that purpose. Who ever is elected at this time will not be ready with his bond by tomorrow - night, it probably cannot l&gt;e had, especially if it comes through a guaranty company. We can send in his application for a bond, and the company will naturally ask who he is, and inquire in regard to his standing, and they will know it before the bond can be approved. I have allo in our secretary and treasurer, but let us do business straight forw legally and like men. Now while I am up I want to say it is my opinion that it wonld not be best to adopt this change at this time. Judge Harris: The year I was president of th« association we held our board meeting </seg>
            <seg id="p019">19 the next morning after the election of officers, and the secretary and treas - urer were asked to furnish bonds. They went out, got their txmdsmen and fixed up their bond be ore they left town. I think this thing can any time, without any additional expense. If it can b e, it can be done Main. \rni strong IT would like to say this about the last statement made by the last ;aker, it does make any difference whether the election of officers is held the semi-annual meeting or not. There are so many other attrai it it is bound to take the interest of the members au iie poultry reting, and men at this time are busy, they are pretty nearly idle, and we ver would have a quorum. resolution must be passed by a majority of the stock-holders, there never v.ould be present at that time, as far as my experience goes. enough members for that pu: Secretary Ludden II move that the amendment to the by-laws be rescinded. Motion re - ved a second, and was adopted. President The next order of business will he COMMUNICATIONS. Secretary Re wick is here and asks that he be allowed to present oralv Lin n's claim for the poultry show next year. President: That would naturally come under the head of miscellaneous business. But I see Governor Mickey is in the room, and I know you will all be glad to hear from him. The I'resident here introduced the Governor, who spoke as follows Governor Mickey Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: — I have not the least idea of ta ng up your valuable lime. I just came to look in and see how you ru our business. I was out and saw the shorthorn breeders how they run thei msiness. and I certainly am pleased with the magnificant show that I ha\ lad the privilege of looking at in the Auditorium. I want to commend yo or your great work. We have come to realize that the poultry business : lis state is one of great proportions. I am certainly pleased with the grea ork you are accomplishing.

I suppose that is why I like to be here, and because you are interested in raising them and because they are pmrt of the products of this state. I speak of this to show you thai I am inter - ested in this line of business. We ought to be proud of the record we are making. We are advancing rapidly not only in this line, but in a great many other lines, in the line of creamery products, and many other things which I have not the time to speak of. Now I don't want to interrupt you in your business here this evt You are keeping pace with every otht r industry in the state, and I appreciate le success you are having. My remarks this evening have no politi. ificance, and it is not necessary for me at this lime to make any political jeech. It would be highly improper and out of place. I could not judge y the complexion of this audience how many republicans, how many emocrats, or how many populists there were. You all look alike in that regard. You look as though you were prospering and getting along well, 'hat is a great thing in building up the commonwealth of a stale like ours. feel very much gratified in meeting you this evening. I hope to tin ;ain. I don't know where you will hold jour next show, but 1 hope to leet you there, and especially if your next show is held in Lincoln. I thank ou for your kind attention. President: We will now hear from Mr. Rewick. Mr. Rewick In regard to the location for your next poultry show there have been so many rumors sent out in regard to the Auditorium and management, we lought it better to speak to you at this time. The Auditorium was erected aotiie five years ago primarily for the purpose of providing a large room for lolding state and national conventions, if we cuuld be fortunate enough to ;et them to our city. Some $25,000 was invested in the Auditorium buili;: nd about fifteen men of this city holding a majority of the stock, have put p the money. It was a great effort to raise the money. Every since that &gt;uilding has been built it has been used for all political conventv ounty, state, and congressional, and other societies free. Some of these rganizations hav. icd of the building on account of its prt ■&gt;m of heating. As you know the floor is perfectly level and thai teat objection to the hall, especially when conventions are held, that they cannot see the speaker, and those in the rear cannot hear, so that the n las been that the organization has run into debt year after year, until it has &gt;ecotne a question whether these people who have put their money into nilding shall go down into their pockets still deeper year after year to meet deficiency, or go to work and raise the floor and put it into shape so that ther organizations, or if you please theatrical companies can use it. The nsurance is {300; the rental of the ground where the building stands, and other expenses, are piling up every year. The janitor service also. We lave no revenue or income, and some of these people seem to feel that after tanding it for five t&lt;ht to put the building in shape so that we </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 can make it useful for other purposes. That is the main reason why w explain this to \ou. Now if these improvements are put in the floor will be and will exclude anything like a poultry exhibit or anything of tha kind. It is very probable that this inipp ie if it is not done that your show ir. I &gt;ne the officers of the club have authorized me to say to you, that i the auditorium cannot be had another year, they would provide quart your exhibit if you come to Lincoln. Under the leadership of Dr. Peters we zed for the meeting of some 22 different societies in this city here this week. That mears about pie who have come to Lincoln. And you have come here for information, and you have come to prepare notes are striving esich year lo pr&lt; duce a better poultry exhibit, and we are glad to have you here. Lincoln has always risen to the emergency of taking care of you when you have come, and we will make ample provisions for you \ our show here next vear, and I think you will. Whenever you have come to L ncoln, you have always had a sucr. I remember when you used to exhibit in a store room, 25 by loc feet. Today our auditorium is not large enough. When our business members met yesterday they all agreed that the p was a great thing; and along with the other meetings you all met 1 it the same time, enable us to secure you good rates. If it were not for the other 15 or t other organizations meeting here, we would not have been able to get •s. I have discovered that railroads, as well as other organizations, are ling together, and last year you got a good half fare rate. It was very generous as to time. This year we asked for the same thing, and every road voted for it exec pt one. Now, gentlemen. I will leave this matter with vou. You know bow you have been treated by us. 1'nfortu.nately our auditorium has run from debt every year, but we hope by good management to cut E: expenses down so that we can give you good term If of the Commercial Club, I am directed to say to you, that in any t we will make ample provision for you if you select this place for ) our next meeting. I thank vou for vour kind attention.

This building carries several hundred more feet than your present auditorium in Lincoln. The question before the house at this time is one of great import - ance and should receive the attention of the stockholders. We should not leave it to the board of managers. We ought to have the at - tention of the majority of the members of this association. Omaha has fiven us a definite proposition, and it is in writing. Lincoln's proposition is oral. She has not signed it. Omaha puts it 111 writing. She nev to honor her word. She will give a building 66 by 132 at least, and if xissihle give the large auditorium. The Omaha Commercial Club is back of this thing, and it is sure to make the show a success. The time has come when Nebraska State Poultry Association should not fail to make an attractive exhibit. If we take this show to Omaha she will give us the best attendance the association has ever had. She has a popnlation of ? while Lincoln has a population naha will put the show within five minutes travel of the center ot the city. She has given you a proposi - tion in writing, and Lincoln's proposition is simply oral. Which one will you accept. Mr. Talbot: They have not had a poultry show in Omaha for some time. Tin a little bit behind the times there, and with the new auditorium they have taken up this matter and have extended us an invitation to come to Omaha, and occupy the Auditorium. The last time the state show was there, the president and secretary of the Commercial Club seemed to think that they ?ot a little bit the worst of it. Now when they extend an invitation to come, if we do not accept, it is a question whether they will offer tli thing again. For that reason, if the expense to the association i- no greater. Per Geo.

            <seg id="p023">23 I should like to have the asscx j there next winter Mr. Shertn &gt;mething in regard to this matter before the taken. I have not the least idea that there shall be such an uneven vote in this matter. This matter reminds me very forcibly of a tnaidei: received a certain proposal, ami she moved or acted so quickly to accept it. Eiat she broke her neck. Now it seems to me that we are li &gt;ve so uicklv tOBtght that we will be apt to break our necks. Neither Lincoln nor Omaha is in a position to make this association any offer that we are oblige 1 at this time to accept. Lincoln has bi n who will do tht thing as she has in the past. They are business men. If we \ Omaha, and the Omaha auditorium is delayed, we have no contra&lt; them in writing, and would have to take what they would give u- ikelv that thev will lay out $1,500 for us. If you vote to go to Omah n all human probability you will pay a rate of one a: er way would be not to go until you know what rate you will be al&gt; ["here is no question but what Lincoln will do as well by us in ihe future as n the past. Who are you for? I am lor the poultry association, I am for he success of the poultry men, and for the success of the poult: iid that Omaha is a little behind the times. in the show room, but we have got to overcome it, if you knock off any first prizes down here. kl think we had better leave this with the board of directors. I think can elect a board who shall do the fair thing, and I am in favor of ing that. Let me tell you a story: At an Easter dinner we had little so'. eggs laki around at each plate, souvenirs of the dinner I the guests droppe I hers on the floor and she exclained, "What shall I do? I have dropped ni\ ting near who happened to be a poultry crank replied, "Just cackle." 1 La Mr. Lemen It has been considered good business poli. ow at Lincoln during the session of the legislature to whom we have the appropriation of (1,000. While I think it would be a good In our show to Omaha, I do not believe it is the best thing to go to Omaha at this time Mr. Tipton I am neither in favor of Lincoln or Omaha man. I am a plain poultry poultry association at heart. I want I have attended these meeting! Omaha, that I am neither a Line man, and I have the interests of the to make this poultry association a sue- four years. A gentleman has alluded to the fact that we have had it here for seven there - fore it shoulil go to Omaha. It is well known that Omaha has a smaller room than we have here. We want a definite proposition f' r audi - torium than ifered us a definite ; </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 and unless we get a satisfactory proposition, we will put up a building in ! that will t&gt;e acceptable to all. I am in favor of leaving it to the board of directors until either Omaha or Lincoln shall make us a proposition that we can accept, a building in which we can do honor to the Americn hen. Mr. Terwilliger: There is another question which I think ought to be taken into consk eration. Lincoln is far more central to a large number of the members o the association If you move to go to Omaha, you will have to take up th matter of freight rates, which is as yet very uncertain. Lincoln is as nearl central as yon can get it, and we have secured all the railroad facilities ble. My idea would he to leave this matter with the board of director with instructions to go to Omaha provided they will furnish us with a sui •ble building. Lincoln has not given us anything definite. They will gi\ us the auditorium if they can, if not sonething else. Whoever we elect a members of this board of directors will take into consideration the in of the poultry men, and the expense that we will be to in going there, am making a successful show. All these matters depend largely upon th expense that the poultrvmen are put to go to the show. It is my opinio that we cannot make the premiums hat will pay the expense necessarily incurred. For that reason we must Weep the show as near to th masses of the people as we can. Mr. Moll: I The question as to what Lincoln will do has been mentioned. Be ident of Lincoln for S years I do not know that we have any kick comin whdt Lincoln has done. She has certainly always fulfilled every statemen : has made. Omaha had our state fair for a few nd sent it bac us and after n it and bringing it back to life, we sent it back t m, and th hack to us in thing lik&lt; ■ As to ho IK it will take to bring it back to life again is a matter of conjecture, ant ; same thing will hold true in regard to the poultry association accordin my way of thinking. I am therefore in favor of leaving this matter to th ird of direct The motion being put by the president it was unanimously adopt, d Mr. Lewelling: I hold in my hand a communication from Swift &amp; Co., Stock v Chicago. Ten years ago our association was incorporated under the laws at the state. We wanted to get an appropriation, and I went to Omaha and went to the stockyards and tried to interest them in starting a packing house for poultry, and got no satisfaction whatever. Everyone of those stockyards companies are killing car loads of poultry and putting them in cold storage and holding for better prices.
