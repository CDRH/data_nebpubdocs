            <seg id="p002">To the Honorable Chester H. Aldrich, Governor of Nebraska. In compliance with the provisions of the statutes. I herewith present for your consideration the Thirteenth Biennial Report of the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics, covering the bi - ennium. in part, from January 15. 1911, to December 1, 1912. Very respectfully. LOUIS V. GUYE, Chief Deputy Commissioner. Lincoln, Nebraska, December 1, 1912. </seg>
           
            <seg id="p003">Establishment of Bureau of Labor AND THE DUTIES THEREOF The Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics was established in the year 1887. The purpose of this bureau was intended to protect the lives, health, limb and safety of the wage earning class, to collect, collate and publish statistics and acts relative to the manufacturing, industrial classes and material resources of the state. Since the establishment of this bu - reau, many additional duties have been added to the already overtaxed physical ability of the two persons charged with the maintenance of the Bureau of Labor. Summarizing the duties of the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics we have the following: That it shall collect, collate and publish annually one bulletin upon the manufacturing statistics of the state. To collect, collate and publish annually, bulletin giving all statistical information upon the agricultural resources and crop production, includ - ing the census of farms, acreage of crops, orchard statistics, live stock, poultry, together with the number having died from disease, and a com - plete record of all farm, city and chattel mortgages. To collect, collate and publish, annually, all statistical information upon industrial accidents and occupational diseases of the wage earners of the state. To collect, collate and publish, annually, bulletin giving the statis - tical information upon all surplus shipments and products raised or manufactured within the state. To collect, collate and publish information concerning the state's re - sources and opportunities, including homestead lands, laws, etc. To inspect all buildings within the state, over three stories in height, as the means of determining whether or not they are properly equipped with fire escapes, both outside iron stairways and automatic metallic fire escapes to be fastened on the inside thereof. The inspection of all theatres and moving picture houses within the state, as the means of determining proper exits in case of fire as well as the construction of the operating booths, etc. </seg>
           
            <seg id="p004">4 chanical establishments, stores, offices, or other concerns, where eight or more persons are employed, which aggregate over 3,600 in number, with reference to the sanitary conditions under which the employees are labor - ing, the safeguarding of all dangerous machinery, etc The maintenance of a free employment bureau, the securement of employment, the securement of positions, and keeping of a complete record of all applications for both employment and employees. The investigation and inquiry into the causes of strikes, and lock - outs, and the holding of investigations, subpoenaing of witnesses as in the courts of procedure. The preparing of placards, for all firms, corporations and parties employing child or female labor. The enforcement of the fire escape, child labor, female labor, factory inspection, theatre and moving picture and building inspection laws, to - gether with the general supervision of the interests and welfare of the 187,345 wage earners within the state, as well as the safeguarding of the lives of the general public Briefly stated, the Deputy Commissioner of Labor is the state statis - tician, fire escape inspector, factory inspector, child labor inspector, fe - male labor inspector, manager of the free employment bureau, board of investigation and chief of the state's general information bureau. For the accomplishment of this work the Deputy Commissioner of Labor is allowed one stenographer at a salary of $840 per year, and is paid an annual salary of $1,500 per year for his services, such being $300 per year less than other Chief Deputy State Officials. For the printing of bulletins, postage, express, telephones, witness fees, etc., he is allowed $1,000 per annum, with $1,500 per annum for traveling expenses, or a grand total of $9,680 for the maintenance of the Bureau of Labor for the entire biennium, including salaries and all other expenses, while the state spends $32,340 in caring for its fish and game, $33,600 in caring for live stock and $39,234 annually, in fees, for the registration for stallions, etc. In other words, Nebraska spends biennially over three times as much for the care of her fish and game, and over three times as much for the care of her live stock, through the office of the State Veterinarian, and over eight times as much for the registration of the stallions as she spends in caring for the welfare of the 187,345 wage earners and their depend - ents, and the women and children of the state. CDS OF AND RE-ORGANIZATION OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL STATISTICS After a careful consideration of the minimum necessities of this bu - reau, if it is to carry out and perform the many duties provided for by law, all of which are of vital importance to the people of the state, a re - organization and additional assistants will be necessary. I therefore moat earnestly recommend for consideration the following proposed plan of re-organi ration: </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 SALARIES Chief Deputy Commissioner, per year, $2,000; for biennium, $4,000 Assistant Deputy Commissioner, per year.... 1,800; for Biennium, 3,600 Factory and fire escape inspector, per year ....; 1,500; for Biennium, 3,000 Chief Clerk and Statistician, per year 1,200; for Biennium, 2,400 Stenographer and Librarian, per year 840; for Biennium, 1,680 Total salaries per year 7,340; for Biennium, 14,680 MAINTENANCE EXPENSES Traveling Expenses, per year $ 2,000; for Biennium $ 4,000 Printing, postage, office supplies, telephone, telegraph, rents, advertising, displays and all incidental expenses, per year 12,000; for Biennium 24,000 $14,000; for Biennium, $28,000 Total expenses, per year Total salaries for Biennium $14,680 Total for Biennium, including salaries and all incidental expenses for the maintenance of the department $42,680 The proposed re-organization of the Bureau of Labor contemplates three material features, namely: the maintenance of a department of factory inspection, free employment bureau and a bureau of publicity for the advertising and exhibiting of the state's resources and oppor- tunities. Any one of the above departments are now costing our neighboring states the amount requested for the maintenance of this entire re-organization. The importance of this bureau is increasing yearly, the duties have been trebled while the cost of maintenance has remained sta- tionary. After much study and two year's actual experience in the maintenance of this bureau the chief deputy commissioner respect- fully submits that the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics of Nebraska can best be equipped for quick and valuable public service by an organization on the plan above outlined in this report, viz: One chief deputy commissioner, to have charge and direction of the general work of the department, subject to the control of the governor. One deputy commissioner who shall have charge of the general office and advertising department subject to the directions of the chief deputy commissioner. One factory inspector, who shall give his attention to factory and fire escape inspections and the enforcement of the inspection laws. He should be located with headquarters in Omaha, where he should also maintain a branch of the free employment bureau and a public display of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. One chief clerk and statistician, whose duties should be to col- </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 lect. collate and tabulate all statistical information and to generally assist the deputy commission in the preparation and publication of all bulletins and reports of the Bureau. One stenographer who would also act as librarian and mailing clerk, and 'clerk of the free employment bureau. Thus the bureau would have a staff of five persons, who could accomplish a great deal of work, some of which is now entirely neglected owing to the lack of funds and help necessary to accom - plish the work provided, by law, as a duty of the department. The laws coming under the supervision of this department are directed at the conservation of human life, health, comfort and safety, the development of the state's resources, the increasing of its popu - lation, each and every one of which is of greater value to the people of our state than the appropriation herein requested for the maintenance of the entire Bureau. FREE EMPLOYMENT BlREAl FThis department is charged with the maintenance of the free oynient bureau, although no provisions have ever been made for expenses of the same. Should such bureau be made effective it will be necessary to maintain a branch office in Omaha, the indus - trial center of the state. The expenses of maintaining such an office should be provided for through legislative appropriation in connec - tion with the department of factory inspection. One of the problems in connection with the free employment bureau is the private employment agencies, which is an evil coming continually within the notice of this department. Thousands of dol - lars, yearly, are filched from poor men and women seeking employ - ment, often being shipped hundreds of miles to find themselves stranded without money or employment. This department has investigated two cases of this nature, finding in each that said employment agencies were working in league with employees of large corporations who were dividing the spoils with such agencies. In each instance said employment agencies were located outside of the state so that the laws of Nebraska were inadequate in protecting the individuals. I most respectfully recommend that laws licensing employment agencies within the state be enacted placing all such under the regula - tion of this department. L During the past eighteen months positions have been secured i-17 persons, principally as farm laborers. FEMALE LABOR LAWS The female labor law is one which employs much of the time of the Deputy Commissioner of Labor, for the reason that its enforce - ment is lodged with this bureau. Three prosecutions for the violation of the female labor law have </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 been successfully conducted, resulting in a conviction in two cum. In the third case the suit was dismissed at the cost of the defendant and upon the stipulation that the violation of the law should cease. In the two cases in which a conviction was had, the complaint was for the violation of that section prohibiting the employment of women between the hours of 10 o'clock P. M. and 6 o'clock A. M. In the case of Charles Prenica, his attorneys made the contention that the law was unconstitutional, and that the intention of the legislature was not to prohibit the employment of women "in any manufacturing, mechanical or mercantile establishment, hotel or restaurant in the state," between the hours of 10 P. M. and 6 A. M. The court held the law was constitutional and that it did prohibit the employment of female workers, in those industries, between the hours of 10 P. M. and 6 A. M. This law applies only to certain industries, namely, "manufacturing, mechanical or mercantile establishments, hotels or restaurants." Much dissatisfaction and complaint against this law, is due to the fact that it excludes telephone companies and in fact everything excepting those classes of industries specifically mentioned in the law. I recommend that this law be amended so as to cover all classes of business. In case such amendment should fail, then and in that event the commissioner of labor or his deputies should be given discretionary power for the enforcement of this law as it is now compulsory in all CHILD LABOR LAW. The enforcement of the child labor law has occupied a considerable portion of the time of this bureau, but the lack of adequate means and inspectors made it impossible to cover the field as effectively as it should be covered. Through the volunteer service of a few interested persons, the co-operation of the truant officers of Omaha and South Omaha, and the juvenile court officials of Omaha and Lincoln, the depart - ment has been greatly assisted in the enforcement of the child labor laws. Much credit should be given to the employers throughout the entire state for their co-operation in the compliance with the child labor laws. In every instance where a question has been raised as to the age of the children employed they were promptly discharged and in no case has it been found necessary to bring an action in court as the employer in - riably compelled the filing of the proper certificate as provided for the law. tThe law provides that "the superintendent of schools, or the school tors of any village, town, or county shall transmit between the first tenth day of each month to the office of the State Commissioner of ir, a list of the names of children to whom certificates have been issued." This section of law is not complied with excepting in a very few instances, nor have we had one single response from the Board of Inspectors acting under this law. No penalties are provided for the </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 failure of those charged with the enforcement of this law, nor is there â ny responsible head to whom anyone can look for the specific carrying out of the provisions of this law, excepting the prosecution thereof. In other words, this law lacks the elements of a proper organization as the means of securing a greater efficiency. On September 1, 1912, we had 311 children between the ages of 14 and 16 yean employed within the state, all holding certificates from proper officers. Only 176 permits having been reported to this office. FIRE ESCAPES. In the enforcement of the fire escape law, the Deputy Commissioner of Labor, and his assistants, deputized under this law, have traveled ex - tensively and have succeeded in having erected many fire escapes where the law was being violated. In nearly every instance where the matter was brought to the attention of those occupying or owning buildings a prompt compliance was made. The fire escape law should be amended so as to bring all classes of buildings over two stories in height within its scope. As now constituted it provides that where the building is over two stories in height and is "designated for occupancy of fifteen or more persons, it shall be pro - vided with one or more fire escapes.'' The burden of proof, therefore, falls upon the Commissioner of Labor to prove that there are fifteen or more persons occupying the building at any one time, which is often im - possible to prove. One specific case of this nature came before the pres - ent Deputy Commissioner, which was as follows: A complaint was made by a family occupying a three story apartment house, in Omaha, where living quarters for six families were being maintained. The owner re - fused to equip the premises with fire escapes upon the contention that it was not designed for, and was not occupied by fifteen or more per - sons. After taking a census of the building we found that but four - teen persons were living therein. Both the Attorney General and the County Attorney held that it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove that there were fifteen or more persons congregating in such premises before a conviction could be had, so that six families are without protection because the present law requires that there must be fifteen or more persons there before they are entitled to protection. I recommend that this law be amended so as to afford protection re - gardless of the number of persons for which the premises may have been designed or which may or may not occupy the same. I base this recommendation upon the theory that the intended purpose of this law was to furnish reasonable and adequate means of escape, in case of fire, tc all persons therein, whether one or five hundred, whether male or female, white or black, therefore, in my judgment, all limitations should be eliminated. Another difficult feature of this law is that section pertaining to auto - matic fire escapes, which are fastened on the inside of the building and </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 THEATRE AND MOVING PICTURE INSPECTION. which supplement the means of escape, in case of fire, by providing an automatic fire escape which may be used, if for any reason one is un - able to reach or use the outside stair fire escape. The law provides that all such automatic fire escapes shall be approved by the Deputy Com - missioner of Labor. Under the provisions of this law we have approved three such escapes, namely: The Verigg, manufactured at Grand Island, Nebraska; The Improved Wilson, by the W. S. Knott Co., Agent, Omaha, Nebraska; The Pratt Automatic Fire Escape, Omaha, Nebraska; all of which came within the scope of the law, working automatically, continuously and with - out the necessity of any special knowledge on the part of the operator and which ,in my judgment, afford excellent additional or supplementary relief in case of fire. The difficult problem in the enforcement of this feature of the fire escape laws was that the Automatic fire escape protection was new both to the public and the owners of the building. Secondly, that this law very largely pertains to hotels, lodging houses, rooming and apart - ment houses where the hotel commission has jurisdiction and said con - cerns therefore, felt that they were fully complying with the laws when they complied with all requirements of the Hotel Commission. The legislature of 1911 enacted a law providing that the Deputy Commissioner of Labor shall inspect all theatres and moving picture houses as a means of providing the proper exits in the case of fire and the proper construction of all operating booths. This law has for its purpose the preservation of the lives of the public and therefore necessi - tated considerable effort on the part of this department. Through the good offices of the Deputy Fire Warden and his In - spectors, this bureau has received much valuable assistance in the in - spection of both fire escapes, theatres and moving picture houses. The City Fire Warden of Omaha, Mr. Morris, also rendered splendid assist - ance in the enforcement of those laws and I take this occasion to express my appreciation of their valuable services, which were rendered gratui - tously. A ready and willing response has been given to this law to the extent that prosecution has been unnecessary. In two instances it was found necessary to close two picture houses until they reconstructed their operating booths and placed rear exits. Because of the highly inflammable materials used in the construc - tion of the films, the element of danger is always present in the moving picture show. On the other hand, they are too often operated in build - ings inadequate and unfitted for use as a place of public amusement Therefore, only the closest supervision, by the state, will insure the safety of the public patronage . As a means of more thoroughly protecting the public, in this ever growing and popular class of amusement, I would recommend that a </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 law be created licensing all concerns operating a moving picture booth and that the operator be also required to pass an examination. That there be created a Board of Examiners for the purpose of issuing such licenses and that the entire supervision of the law shall vest with the Bureau of Labor. BlILDINC; INSPECTION. The inspections coming under the provisions of what is known as the building law are confined, practically, to Omaha and Lincoln. This law has met with a substantial observance, although, in several in - stances, il was found necessary to force a compliance, which did not Hate an action in court. The contractors of Lincoln seem to be more reluctant in the ob - servance of the law, but are conforming to its requirement whenever called upon to do so. Like many other problems, the question of laws protecting the lives of the workmen and their observance are questions of education. When the employer is made to see that the observance of law will result in financial gain to himself, then he readily obeys the law and the laborer receives just protection. This law should be amended, so as to broaden its scope, covering the many other features omitted in the law as it now stands. Much assistance has been (riven, in Omaha, in the enforcement of the law, by the city building department, and Mr. Hale, of the Car - penters' Union, who has acted as inspector, without compensation. I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of their service in the enforcement of this law. FACTORY INSPECTION. BThe legislature in 1911 enacted the law known as "the factory in - fection law," which provides that all factories, mills, mechanical or mercantile establishments or other institutions where eight or more shall pi ety appliances and equipments for the protection of the health, life and limb of the work - men. This law also provides that the Labor Commissioner, Deputy Labor Commissioner or Factory Inspectors shall inspect all such insti - tutions for the purpose of determining as to whether or not said law is being violated. After the passage of the Factory Inspection Law the legislature failed to make an appropriation for its maintenance, or to provide for a factory inspector to make the inspections therein provided for. To Eith the terms of this act we found that it would be necessary t over two thousand institutions. That to do this properly quire over three hundred days, adding to this would come Follow up inspection as a means of enforcing t! r safeguarding machinery, etc. To add such an enormous duty to the already over burdened Deputy </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 Commissioner of Labor, whose only assistant is one lady stenographer, was, to say the least, overtaxing the physical possibility of this Bureau. The work to be accomplished being of such a nature and of such im - portance that I resolved to carry out the duties prescribed at any cost. The fire escape law provides that the Deputy Commissioner of La - bor shall have the right to appoint "such persons as inspectors as shall be necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act." Proceeding under this law I appointed inspectors commissioned as fire escape and factory inspectors, who have given much time to the duties of fire escape and factory inspections and the collecting of such infor - mation, upon the conditions of employment in the industrial institu - tions of Nebraska. For such services said inspectors have drawn the sum of $975 and have been so employed 423 days, said sum so drawn having been charged to and paid out of the traveling expense fund ap - propriated for this department. As to the results of the inspection of factories, mills, workshops, mercantile or mechanical institutions or other buildings where eight or more persons are employed made under this law, a full and detailed report will be found elsewhere, together with an elaborate industrial survey of the general conditions of all classes of wage earners of Ne- I most respectfully recommend that the factory inspection law be amended as follows: That the general terms of this law be so amended as to apply to all institutions employing one or more persons, instead of eight or more persons. That all classes of accidents shall be reported to the Commissioner of Labor instead of fatal and such as shall cause a loss of more than two weeks time. That the Deputy Commissioner of Labor, in case of emergency, shall be empowered to appoint, temporarily, such factory inspectors as may be necssary to comply with the terms of this law. said inspectors to be compensated out of any funds appro - priated for the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics. INDUSTRIAL SURVEY. The laws defining the duties of the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics provides that "the duties of said Commissioner shall be to collect, collate and publish statistics and facts relative to manufactures, INDUSTRIAL CLASSES and material resources of the state, and ESPECIALLY TO EXAMINE INTO THE RELATIONS BETWEEN LABOR AND CAPITAL, as well as kindred subjects and matters per - taining to the welfare of industrial interests and classes." In pursuance of the duties therein prescribed the Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics has prepared a complete and detailed survey of the conditions of Nebraska, the full record of which will be found elsewhere in this report. Said report includes within its scope the num - ber of wage earners, wages, hours of employment, the sanitary condi - tions under which each class are compelled to labor, the average cost of </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 living, the number meeting with accident and injury during the hours of employment, and the occupational diseases found in the Nebraska industries, etc. I most respectfully recommend that a law be created providing for a minimum wage for the female wage earners, that a law be created providing for one day's rest in every seven, in those industries in which continuous industrial activities are necessary, and that all sickness re - sulting from occupational disease shall be reported to the Deputy Com - missioner of Labor. IMMIGRATION. All matters pertaining to the question of immigration seem to have become an inherent duty devolving upon the Deputy Commissioner of Labor. Time beyond which the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, and in the absence of any specific law covering this subject, all matters pertaining to immigration have been, by all state depart - ments, referred to and cared for by the Bureau of Labor and Indus - trial Statistics. Lin May, 1911, a call was received for a meeting of the various State igration Officials to meet in Chicago, during July of that year, for the purpose of effecting an association of immigration officials as a means of solving the general problems confronting the various states upon this subject. In the absence of any regular legally established official representative, the present Deputy Commissioner of Labor was, by the Governor, issued a credential and did attend and participate in such meeting as the representative of Nebraska. This meeting elected as its Secretary-Treasurer the present Deputy Labor Commissioner, which position he still holds. The result of this organization was the stimulating of an interest upon this previously dormant subject. The question being what can be done as a means of promoting immigration in Nebraska. The fact of having no funds with which to promote the work and the lack of any previous activities along those lines presented a discouraging outlook. Realizing that with over 20,000,000 idle acres in Nebraska, that a work of this character was most essential to the welfare of our state, I there - fore set about to find a method of accomplishing the desired results. First, I discovered that Nebraska yet had over 1,000,000 acres of land rubject to homestead entry. Second, that there were a great multitude of people who were desirous of getting back to the land. The problem was, therefore, to bring together Nebraska's idle lands and the men who would occupy said lands, thereby placing them in the productive A* a means of bringing prospective homesteaders to our state, I E listed the assistance of the railway companies, succeeding in them place, in their advertising space, the fact that Nebraska Is subject to homestead entry, and secondly, that a representa - he state would be at a given point on a certain date to meet and </seg>
            <seg id="p013">BUREAU OF LABOR 13 to explain to all prospective home seekers the class of lands, terms of entry, etc. I next secured the co-operation of the National Association of Immigration Officials, in organizing back to the land clubs at the points where I intended making my stops as previously advertised. The traveling expense fund of the Bureau of Labor was used as the means of defraying my traveling expenses, which it will be noted is all this movement has cost the State of Nebraska. The total net results of this movement was that I succeeded in run - ning: Â» special train, starting from Chicago, on which were brought to the state one hundred and fifty men, most of whom filed upon claims. In all we succeeded in securing over four hundred families as the direct result of our labors, to say nothing of those who filed as the result of our advertising campaign and of whom we have no account. The cost, to the state, of this campaign was less than four hundred dollars for over four hundred families or less than $1 per family. This movement is the result of organized immigration and is a proof of what can be accomplished if the proper effort is put forth. In my recommendations for the re-organization of the Bureau of Labor and the requested appropriation therefor I have included the con - tinuance of this work. I most respectfully recommend that said work be continued under some department, as it can be made one of the greatest factors in the future developments of our great state. </seg>

            <seg id="p015">Facts Worth Knowing About Nebraska Nebraska has 6,144 miles of main line railroads within its border, comprising seven trunk lines. Nebraska has the largest horse and feeding market in the world. Nebraska has the second largest sheep market. Nebraska has the third largest live stock market and packing cen - ter in the world. Nebraska has the largest creamery and is the greatest dairy pro - ducing state per capita in the world. Nebraska produces one-thirteenth of all the corn, one-fourteenth of all the wheat, one-fifteenth of the oats, one-fourteenth of the hogs, and one-eighteenth of all the cattle of the entire United States. Nebraska is the third largest producer of sugar beets and the first in poultry and eggs. FINANCIAL Nebraska has no bonded indebtedness, no floating indebtedness, has a million dollars in her depository, cashes her warrants without dis - count, and owns, in the way of school lands, school property, state insti - tutions, interest bearing securities and other forms of properties, ap - proximately $600,000,000. ACREAGE POPULATION Nebraska has a population of 15.5 persons per square mile or 42 1 -.. acres per capita. The state of Rhode Island has a population of 455.4 persons per square mile or 1 2-5 acres per capita. Nebraska produces a surplus sufficient to feed the entire state of Rhode Island, while on an average one acre of Nebraska land will produce double the quantity of crops that an acre of Rhode Island land will produce </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 Nebraska is making this record with only every other acre of her land under cultivation, with land values at the minimum and her farm - ers tilling the soil under the general methods which are not capable of producing the results which are obtainable under scientific methods. VALUE OF FARM BUILDINGS AND MACHINERY The total value of farm land and buildings was given in 1910 as 11,811,000,000 as against $577,000,000 in 1900, an increase of $1,233, - 000,000, or 214 per cent. The total value of all farm land alone reported in 1910 is $1,613, - 000,000 as compared with $486,000,000 in 1900, a gain of $1,126,000, - 000, or 231 per cent.

A large amount of this land being deeded. tThe state may logically be divided into three general divi - :h would thus be known as follows: The southeastern section, com - ing the corn, wheat, hog, alfalfa and orcharding district. Land valu - ation in this district will be found to run from $50 per acre to $150. The rough land along the Missouri river, which is especially adapted to or - chard growing, being the cheapest grade in such district, averaging from $50 to $100 per acre, which, as a rule, is too rough for crop growing, such feature adding to the value of the land as a fruit growing district. The second section, consisting of the southwestern part of the state, which embraces alfalfa, small grain and those crops particularly suited to irrigation, which embraces sugar beets, onions, etc. Land values in this district ranging from $15 to $150, embracing the entire Platte valley. The northwestern district, comprising what is known as the hay and stock raising district, the chief enterprise being haying, stock raising, dairying and poultry raising . This territory being one of the grt- .: hay producing sections in the United States. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HOMESTEADING The northwestern district contains several hundred thousand acres of land subject to homestead entry under the Kinkaid Act, which per - mits of the homesteading of 640 acres. Requiring three years actual residence and the placing thereon of improvements to the valuation of $800 per section. This land is suitable for stock raising, but is not what might be termed a farming country. The land is covered with grass, which makes a splendid pasture, while the valleys will produce good hay if properly taken care of. The majority of this land lies several miles from the railroads and is without school facilities. The climate is health - ful, water good, cattle and horses living on the range the entire year. One should be possessed of a few hundred dollars before undertaking permanent settlement upon these lands, as it will be found necessary to secure stock sufficient to utilize the land. The chief drawback to the pioneer life in the sand hill country, under the Kinkaid law, is the monotony and isolation made certain owing to the fact that each farm contains 640 acres, which places the residents one mile apart. WHO MAY TAKE A HOMESTEAD A citizen of the United States 21 years of age or over, any head of family, persons who have relinquished or lost a homestead without receiving a consideration, or whose former entry was not cancelled for fraud.

            <seg id="p020">20 June 5, 1900. Any unmarried woman 21 years of age. A deserted wife may also take a homestead. Terms of service (not to exceed four years) in the army or navy of the United States during the Civil or Spanish-American war, or dur - ing the Philippine insurrection, may be deducted from the three years' service residence required on a homestead, provided that one year's ac - tual residence, together with the requisite $800 worth of improvements shall obtain. Settlers have six months from the date of filing to establish resi - dence. The three years' residence required dates from the time of actual settlement, there being allowed a leave of absence of five months each year, providing notice is filed with the land office requesting such leave of absence and of the settler's return at expiration of said absence. Kications for homestead entry should be accompanied by a re - of a fee of fourteen dollars and should state the number of , range and section for which entry is being made. IRRIGATED LANDS E Nebraska possesses several hundred thousand acres of the most fer - irrigated land. There are many thousand acres more to come r the irrigation ditch, such section being principally confined to the Platte river country, which may be known as the Nile of America. This country presents splendid opportunities for agricultural home build - ing, as land values range from $40 to $150 per acre, which makes the cheapest class of farm land when we take into consideration the fact that 50 acres is all that is required, while the crop failures are unknown because of the question of irrigation. WHO MAY TAKE IRRIGATED AND ORCHARD LANDS Any person who is possessed of a good, clear conception of nature's golden opportunities, who is energetic and the recipient of sufficient coin of the realm to exchange for one-half hundred acres of Nebraska's fertile irrigated or orchard lands. One who will add his might and his coin in helping to still further develop Nebraska's agricultural, manu - facturing and fruit growing resources to the end that he may enjoy the grand opportunities now beckoning to the investors in Nebraska's re- BY-PRODUCTS OF THE FARM Nebraska produced in 1911, in by-products of the farm, aside from the regular crops, live stock and manufacturing industries as shown by our schedule of surplus shipments, which represents the amount of prod - ucts shipped from the state and does not take into account that part consumed at home, being as follows: Poultry, both live and dressed, $2,604,622; ens, $40,279,651; vegetables, $38,100; dairy products, in- </seg>

Hence we find the aggregate wealth to be as follows: Crop valuation, 1912 $238,946,391 Orchard products, 1912 7,878,899 Manufacturing output, 1911 168,368,383 Surplus or by-products, 1911 73,822,663 Live stock valuation, 1911 144,892,205 Or a grand total valuation of $633,908,541 or $531.70 per capita or $2,658.50 per family. L Nebraska, with a population of 1,192,214, with only one-half of her under cultivation and with the average size farm approximating 300 acres, produced in 1910 a surplus per capita valued at $61.92, which together with our crop and orchard production would total an amount sufficient to maintain double the population which we now have. This Crd being made upon lands valued at the price of taking ihomestead - up to the irrigated sections valued as high as $200 per acre. MANUFACTURING RESOURCES OF NEBRASKA The total number of manufacturing concerns reporting for the year 1911 were 1,109, having a total combined capital of $88,193,093. The total number of wage earners employed in the concerns reporting was 22,886,. The total cost of materials used was $115,258,349. The total value of goods manufactured being $168,428,783. rThe increase in the number of establishments over 1910 being 159; â¢ase in capital, $24,809,877; increase in number of wage earners be - 2,927; increase in the total wages paid, $2,624,950; increase in the cost of materials consumed, $1,808,068; increase in the total value of goods manufactured, $18,320,163. It will be observed that in the manufacturing industries the photo - graphers, tailors, dress makers and milliners are not listed as manufac - turing concerns for the reason that it is almost impossible to secure a reliable report upon such institutions. As a manufacturing state, Ne - braska stands eighteenth, without the above industries; in the value of output, thirty-first in capital invested, thirty-second in the number of wage earners employed, and thirty-third in the amount paid in wages. A careful comparison of Nebraska's population as compared with other states which surpass her in her manufacturing industries, together with the fact that Nebraska is without coal and mineral products, which means expensive power and the shipping of raw materials, such facts demonstrating the progressive enterprise and thrift of Nebraska and her business interests. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Fruit Culture in Nebraska COMMERCIAL ORCHARDING Fn dealing with this subject we give, herein, to our readers the basic absolute facts. All statements are dependable and can be sub - stantiated, by our readers, through references made upon each subject and specific instance cited. We are appealing only to those who are seek - ing the truth as the means of securing homes with a permanent income for the future. If you would grow fruit for your livelihood and wish to make each dollar invested bring back the largest possible returns, you must con - sider the governing, growing conditions that give color, size, texture and keeping qualities. Soil, sunshine, rainfall, shelter, drainage and eleva - tion, each and all beng essential to successful fruit growing if backed by a stout heart, willing hands and a moderate amount of gray matter of average quality. Shrewdness or smartness on the part of the grower is not the re - quisite, but rather intelligence, industry and faithful appliance. The necessary knowledge is readily obtainable and its success depends upon its application. The first point to be understood is that fruit growing re - quires just as much attention, time and energy as the raising of com. wheat, horses, hogs and alfalfa. APPLE (.ROWING tThe average profits on apple orcharding is largely dependent upon individual, therefore it is difficult to give a conservative estimate of the average profit per year. We are putting it mildly, we believe, when we say that an orchard in southeastern Nebraska will average a net profit of more than $250 per acre per year after the bearing age. Trees cannot be expected to bear much the sixth year and after the seventh the following yields: Seventh, IS bushels per tree; eighth, 3; ninth, 4; tenth, 5; making a general average thereafter of five bushels per tree with fifty trees to the acre of 250 bushels per acre. The entire cost of the care of the orchard, including the pruning, spraying, packing and marketing the crop after the seventh year is conservatively esti - mated at 50c per bushel, which represents the highest standard grades. The average market price for the first class for the past ten years on apples has been $1.50 per bushel, which gives a net profit of $1.00 per </seg>

Every - body eats apples, providing they can get them, and yet apple production in the United States has diminished the past ten years, while the mar - kets have increased. In 1896 the United States produced Â«9,000,000 barrels of apples. In 1904-5-6 an average of 45.000,000. In 1907-8-9-10 an average of 28, - 000,000. The diminishing production of apples being due, largely to the fact that the apple growing is being developed along scientific lines just like stock, grains and other staples. The breeding of swine has long since replaced the rail splitter, the thoroughbred dairy herd the lanky ranger and acclimated cereals the forage seeding of the old days. Fruit raising, heretofore, has been considered a bi-product of the farm. Its culture consisting chiefly in planting and picking without care or attention. Like other staple foods, those who were making a business of fruit growing have scientifically developed flavors, size, color and qual - ity through the scientific methods of pollination, grafting, etc. Aided by the system of pruning, spraying, fertilizing and cultivation. Like the development of the standards of other food arti Â»&gt;n as the cul - tured fruits were placed upon the markets the price and demands for the uncultured diminished. Hence the farmers and untrained fruit have abandoned the orchards ami have satisfied their own com convincing themselves that fruit growing was too scientific or that the soil or climate is not adapted to the (rowing of such crops, especially has this been true in Nebraska.

An abundance of is usually present." FRUITS "Apples. â Most of the southeast counties have now become quite im - portant shippers of apples. Nearly all the state can grow them, though how much of it can produce apples as a profitable commercial crop is not yet demonstrated. It is certain that apples are a very profitable crop in all the southeastern counties, but most farmers are not experienced or - chardists and fruit growing does not receive the attention it deserves. Very few orchards are ever sprayed and in consequence an inferior grade of fruit is usually put on the market. That with reasonable care apples of excellent quality can be produced in all southeastern Nebraska is no longer open to question." "We have much land, especially the glaciated areas in Saline, Sew - ard, Saunders, Lancaster, Pawnee, Johnson, Nemaha, Richardson, Otoe and Cass counties, and many of the loess hills of these counties that would probably produce more profit from apples than from any other crop. These hilly lands are especially adapted to orcharding. The soils are favorable and the excellent air drainage secured by the rough topo - graphy gives protection from frosts. Many of the poor, stony hills, which a few years ago were producing scarcely enough grain to pay for cultivation, are now growing large crops of apples and have become the moÂ«t profitable parts of the farms." "Grapes. â Such hardy varieties of grapes as Concords and Moore's Early are quite certain to produce a good crop of fruit in the east half of the state at least. Some of the rough land in the eastern counties is especially suited to vineyards . The vicinity of Council Bluffs, Iowa, which is gaining a wide reputation for its grapes, presents no essential difference from thousands of acres of land on the west side of the river." "Cherries, Plums, Gooseberries, Currants and Strawberries. â These fruits can be grown in all counties. Several of them are wild in nearly every county. There are a few things grown that have never given such large profits as are often secured from small areas of strawberries produced for the local markets, and yet few towns have a home supply. Blackberries in favorable locations are wonderfully productive and should find a place on every farm in many countfes and on many farms in most counties." "Peaches are grown in a commercial way in a number of counties. Several orchards of over one hundred acres are known. They can be grown profitably for home use in at least one-fourth of the state.

The average date of killing frost in spring is from April 15th to 18th; the average date of killing frost in autumn from October 9th to 12th, the date being the latest record of killing frost in spring was May 19th, the date of earliest killing frost in autumn, September 18th." </seg>
            <seg id="p026">Progress and Development of Labor Organization The history of the progressive development of labor's cause, as well as the necessity for mutual co-operation, has grown out of the progress in our industrial life. Such history may logically be portrayed through a recital of the part played by the workers in "the gentle craft of leather:" "Oh! workers of the old time, styled The gentle craft of leather? Young brothers of the ancient guild Stand forth once more together'/ Call out again yonr long array. lu the olden merry manner; Once more, on gay St. Ohrispian's Day Fling out your blazoned banner!" â Whittler The cobbler in the streets of Rome, the guild brotherhood in the middle ages, the early New England hand-workers in the little shop, and the operative of today, who guilds an ingenious machine in the big factory, having all left their imprints upon the era in which they lived. The leather industry is typical in the developments from hand to machine labor; from shop to factory production and from individual to collective bartering for the sale of the labors of the workmen. The shoe factory having been far less potent than the cotton factory in crushing out the individuality of the employees in the change from home to factory labor. tThe sharp competition among the manufacturers for the market, the still sharper competition among the workmen for the job, has gradually forced each to methods of self-preservation. The condition of labor is constantly interrupted by the introduction of new labor-saving and profit-increasing machinery, and the consequently increasing fa - cility with which comparatively unskilled labor may be utilized in the operation of the machine. The power of greed, the desire for more profit together with the rapid development of industrial production, has made the formation of labor unions a necessity on the part of the toilers.

Seeking, as a natural consequence, the best possible terms, basing their contracts upon better wages, shorter working days and better sanitary conditions under which to perform their labors. The Ideals of the labor unions in the abolition of child, prison, and sweat shop labor, and its competition with the product of the employers of free labor. The securement of those laws tending to pro - tect Motherhood, Childhood and Manhood.

I Membership in the labor unions extends the righ hand fellowship all wage earners regardless of creed, color, or nationality, who will til themselves of the opportunity of such membership, teaching the nciples of both citizenship and workmanship, extending to the adult the educational advantages offered to his children by the state, the only requisite being good moral character. Being the natural out - growth of the social, economic and industrial developments of society, and are the simple evolution of the toiling masses, stimulated by the progressive enlightenment of civilization, and are the humane methods of effectively dealing with the organized methods of employment. As a natural consequence the trades union movement is meeting with the prejudice of the great masses of our people because of its relation to the industrial and commercial world, this being due, prin - cipally, to the 'ack of an understanding of their true aspirations. The labor union are being judged by their mistakes rather than by their accomplishments in the interest of struggling humanity. In other words, the prejudice of the unthinking have branded the acts of a Parks, or a McNamara, as the evidences of an unholy cause, measuring the rank and file by the standard of a few misguided leaders, failing to take into account the many good deeds performed in the interests of mankind. PLAN OF ORGANIZATION tThe Plan of Organization of the labor unions organized ;r the banner of -the American Federation of Labor, consists of local n, city central labor unions, state federation of labor, international ns and the American Federation of Labor. Their system of organi- </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 ration being known as the federated plan, and is similar in its structure to the plan of organization of the United States Government. The unit of the organization of the labor union consists of the individual member of the local union, and is identical with the citi zenship of our state. The Central Labor Union consists of a given number of delegates, elected by the general membership of the local unions of a town or city, which in turn constitutes the parliament of labor, having jurisdiction over and the right to the passage of such laws as are nec - essary for the mutual government of those affairs affecting the interests of all local unions of such city. This body being similar both in its structure and its powers to the city council or the commission of our city governments. The State Federation of Labor is constituted exactly on the same lines as the city central labor union with the exception that its jurisdiction for the passage of laws extended over the entire state and its powers and duties parallel those of our state legislature, and its laws those of our state laws. The American Federation of Labor consists of the repre - sentatives of city central bodies, state federation, federal labor union and international unions, all delegates thereto being elected by their respective bodies. The American Federation of Labor being similar to our federal government, having jurisdiction over such affairs as are national in their scope, being identical with the legislative duties of the United States Senate and Congress. From the A. F. of L., the highest authority in the labor movements, radiates back to the individual membership certain judicial rights pe - culiar to the industrial problems of the American workmen. Namely, the right of each craft to govern its own affairs without interference or dictation of any other department of labor. As a means of ac - complishing this end the A. F. of L. charters INTERNATIONAL UNIONS, which thereby becomes the supreme head or authority of that particular craft and this international union in turn grants charters of affiliation to all local unions of such craft granting the right of "Local Autonomy" or local self-government, including the right of the local union to regulate its own wage scale, hours of labor and local rules governing its local affairs. Each member of a local union pays into the local treasury, as dues, a certain sum ranging from 50c per month to one per cent of his weekly salary, the dues being largely governed by the benefits accruing from such membership. A percentage of the dues are retained by the local treasury for the purpose of defraying the local expenses, the remainder going to the international union as the per capita tax, such tax being used to defray the benefits accruing to the local unions which includes in its scope sick benefits, death or burial benefits, out of work benefits, strike benefits, traveling benefits, old age benefits, maintenance of homes for the aged and crippled members. The International, in turn, paying to the A. F. of L. a per capita on its entire membership as it* portion of the maintenance of the A. F. of L ! </seg>
            <seg id="p029">29 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEES The relations between labor and capital cannot be treated as a mere matter of private business, as it involves social, industrial and political questions and therefore becomes a public issue for the reason that the men who do the most physical work, as a class, seem to receive the least for their labors. Their wages are often barely and sometimes below an amount sufficient to meet the expenses of living. In their life and their work and their relations to their em - ployers, evils and abuses have arisen which it seems impossible for the individual to prevent The attempt to remedy such conditions by organized action having too often proved fruitless, owing to the oppo - sition of the organized methods of employers. LEGISLATION Legislation is the civilized method of redressing the wrongs of the agrieved, where their grievances are of such a nature as to permit of a remedy, and therefore in seeking the remedy there are four ques - tions to be considered. First, how far do the evils complained of really prevail? If they exist widely, such constitutes a public evil. Second, how far can they be remedied? If they can be helped, such constitutes a public grievance. Third, in what manner will the public, the third party to the controversy, suffer through the strife? If they can not be remedied by legislation then it constitutes a political problem and must be dealt with politically. Fourth, will legislation give the proper relief? If so, then the whole people are interested and such relief must show that it is in the interest of, at least, a large percentage of our citizens who are sufferers through the lack of the proper remedy which should be afforded by those who are in control of the jobs. As a means of determining whether or not the organized wage - workers of Nebraska have logically applied the above remedy we trust that our readers may examine carefully the labor laws of Nebraska, which will be found in subsequent chapters. METHODS OF PROMOTING LABOR UNIONS In promoting their welfare, the labor unions employ those methods peculiar to their existence, the force and effect of which are defensive rather than offensive." The terms of such methods are known as con - ciliation, mediation, arbitration, boycott and the strike. Their impor - tance ranging in succession as above noted. Parallel or co-ordinate terms, peculiar to the struggle between capital and labor, have grown out of their disagreements, each being defensive against the other. "The blacklist and the boycott," "the strike and the lockout," and "the open and closed shop" being the ordi - nary terms under which they are known. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 TERMS AND FUNDAMENTALS DEFINED Collective bargaining is the fundamental basic object of the labor unions. The process and the terms by which labor contracts itself, whether oral or written, are determined by negotiation directly between employers and employers organizations, and the labor union. Conciliation is the method of settlement, by the parties directly, of minor disputes, involving the interpretation of the terms of the con - tract, and as to whether or not the contract be an express one or only a general understanding. This method is generally participated in by the local union interested and their contracting employers, being also their methods of formulating their agreements. Mediation is the intervention, of some outside force, with a view of bringing the contesting parties together in conciliatory conferences which may result in their settlement by mutual understanding. Any disinterested person or persons may assume the task of acting as the mediators, the acceptance of their proffer being purely optional or vol - untary on the part of the disputants. Arbitration is the authoritative decision by some person or per - sons other than the parties interested, to whom the issues involved have been submitted. This action coming, as a rule, after the parties to the controversy have failed to agree either through conciliation or mediation. The agreement to submit to arbitration ordinarily carrying with it the points to be covered in the award of the arbitrators. â¢ CO-ORDINATE TERMS AM) METHODS Pn presenting this phase of the contest between employers and ivees we deem it most essential that we go into some of the â ical facts as a means of clearly placing this subject before our rs. Such being, in our judgment, made necessary owing to the that the great rank and file of the people have failed to secure a clear understanding of the true conditions in this ever raging war - fare between capital and labor. Upon this phase of the strife will be found the great fundamental doctrine in the opposing forces arrayed in opposition to each other growing out of our ever-advancing industrial life. "The Blacklist" is a system of conveying the information, from one employer to another, that a certain individual is to be refused em - ployment. This term as well as its application dates back totke early history of the American Labor Movement. The blacklist3*ping the invention of the employers of labor who sought a method of effectively forcing their employees to accept terms and conditions prqgiosed by themselves. It was the original weapon of destruction, used against the labor union, knowledge of membership in which, invariably, served as the reason for blacklisting the holder thereof. The early method of conveying the information of the blacklist was through the letter of recommendation given by the employer to his employee?, such being accomplished through private marks contained thereon. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">31 Pie Boycott is a concerted refusal to purchase or consume the â¢ts of labor made under unfair conditions. The refusal to pur - or consume goods made or sold by those employers who, by acts, have proven themselves unfriendly and unfair to the in - terests of the organized workmen. The boycott is the invention of organized labor, invented as a de - fense against the system of "Blacklisting," its principles and its ef - fectiveness having been learned from the methods of the employers in enforcing the inhuman principles of blacklisting. The principle of the blacklist is directed at the vitals of man, its effects being starvation, while the principles of the boycott is directed at the vitals of commerce, its effects being the curtailment of profits, the former effecting life, the latter property, one the instrument of capital and the other of labor. The Lockout is a refusal on the part of employer or employers to permit a part or all of their employees to work, such refusal, as a rule, being made as a means of enforcing a demand on the part of the em - ployers or resisting a demand on the part of the employees. The lock - out is the second invention of the employers, being the collective method of blacklisting, its effects being the loss of employment, starvation and misery. The forerunner of the lockout, generally coming in the form of an announcement of a wage reduction, the information being con - veyed that, providing the proposed reduction is not accepted, the factory or institution will be closed for an indefinite period, which is generally limited by the power of the endurance of their employees. "The Strike" is a concerted withdrawal from work by a part or all of the employees of a concern, or a system of concerns. As a means of enforcing a demand on the part of the employees or of resisting a demand on the part of the employers. The strike is the weapon and the invention of the labor union, growing out of their education gained through the application of the "lockout" as applied by their employers. The power of the strike being lodged in the loyalty of the membership of the labor unions who, voluntarily, sacrifice themselves and their families in the attempt to establish better conditions under which to labor, realizing that the principles of the greatest good to the greatest number is the ultimate salvation of the great rank and file of their fellow toilers. The prin - ciples of a just cause stimulating their loyalty, patriotism and sacrifice in the interest of humanity, having established not only better wages, shorter hours and better conditions under which to labor, but also the principles of a free people. The Closed Shop is one wherein members of a trade union are em - ployed under contract, written or oral, with the employers wherein the employees agree to labor for a certain specific sum or wage, a given number of hours to constitute a day's labor. The unions designating such as the union shop, the term "closed shop" being applied by the </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 BIENNIAL REPORT In the union shop agreement is included a clause specifying that the employer agrees to employ only members of the contracting organi - sation or those who will become such within a given time. This was found necessary as a means of establishing the stability of both their contract and organization. Work in no instance is denied to those persons who are willing to avail themselves of the privilege of membership, thereby becoming a part and parcel of the contracting body bearing their just share of the burdens of unions and its duties. The union maintains that those who benefit by their labors should pay their share of maintenance. That the union or contract shop is no more a closed shop because of its demand of admittance than a theatre could be classed as a closed shop because it requires a ticket of ad - mission at the regulation price before one is entitled to partake of its entertainment. The Open Shop is one which is not under contract with a labor union refusing to recognize union rules, hours of employment, wages, etc. The open shop is as a rule closed to the union man unless he will sign an agreement to relinquish membership in his trades union. The so-called "open shop" is the invention of the employers as the resistance against the union or contract shop of their employees. SIMILARITY careful comparison with the foregoing co-ordinate terms will rly show the methods, terms and systems of capital and labor to similar in every respect. Labor, however, invariably receives the blame for using the harsh method of boycotting and striking, whereas they learned the lesson from their employers who use the same tactics through the blacklist and lockout. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">33 FACTORS IN LABOR'S PROGRESS THE UNION LABEL I The union label has become one of the great factors in the trades n movement, as it affords a means whereby those who sympathize le cause of labor can effectively lend their support through its pat - ronage. Thus forcing the industry to bear the burdens of the industrial strifes instead of the individual workmen who now bears the entire burdens through starvation and misery. The union label is the registered trademark or emblem of recog - nition of the labor union. It is furnished under contract, to those em - ployers who agree to deal fairly with their employees, and is placed upon the articles made under sanitary, healthful conditions. Standing as it does, as the guarantee against disease and germ-ladened com - modities created under the sweat shop system of production. The union label offers the same remedy for the harsh, unhuman and uncalled for methods employed by both capital and labor in their warfare against each other, in which the public, the third party to the controversy, must suffer; namely, the black list and the boycott, the lockout and the strike. Placing as it does, in the hands of the people a method whereby they may voice the powers of public sentiment upon those issues affecting the public weal. Such being accomplished through the centralization of the purchasing powers of the community without inconvenience to anyone. 'Tis the civilized methods of redress - ing the wrongs of mankind without bloodshed, misery or the sufferings of humanity, the shifting the load from human endurance to commercial and industrial participation. In other words the union label is a method whereby the men and women outside of the union may exercise an influence upon those questions affecting the people by purchasing the commodities bearing such label. A method whereby every woman, when spending her money, may speak directly and forcefully upon those questions affecting child and woman labor. Giving as it does the oppor - tunity for the women, the purchasers of the home, to exercise the world's greatest influence upon those general social, moral and economic issues affecting the welfare of mankind. COMPULSORY ARBITRATION The people in a certain community often unconsciously and unwill - ingly become the third party to the contests between capital and labor. Thus being made to bear the greatest share of the burdens resulting </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 from such disputes through advanced prices and inconvenience of service. Such invariably being the result where the contesting forces are en - gaged in those industries dealing in a service or community upon which the public are dependent Whenever the public is made to suffer through any inconvenience a remedy is sought which will effectively check those conditions re - sponsible for such suffering. Proceeding upon this theory, we find a great many persons advocating the doctrine of compulsory arbitration as the remedy for the people's grievances in the disputes bteween capi - tal and labor. Compulsory arbitration is a law whereby both employer and em - ployee are forced to submit their disputes to persons designated, by law, as the board of arbitration, being bound by their decisions without recourse or reservation. A law whereby the third party, the public, may step in and arbitrarily force a settlement which probably is not acceptable to either of the contesting parties. The labor unions most heartily disapprove of the doctrine of com - pulsory arbitration. Their judgment being based upon actual experience with compulsory laws, court injunction and those influences exercised over courts having compulsory powers. The writ of injunction in labor disputes being the exercise of the basic power sought to be established through the passage of compulsory arbitration laws. The only difference being that the former prohibits the doing of the things necessary for success, while the latter compels the doing of the things necessary for defeat. 'Tis the methods of creating the courts of arbitration and the influences which may be exercised over such boards by capital to which labor objects and is the sentiment responsible for the agitation of the recall of our judiciary. The men of labor stand ever ready to submit their grievances to voluntary arbitration. Such being a mutual agreement to submit a dispute, upon which the employers and employees cannot agree, to per - sons who may be mutually agreed upon as a board of arbitration. Ordi - narily the employers choose one arbitrator, the employees one, those two choosing the third. In this manner each contestant feels that they have equal chances and that their interests are being considered by one at least who understands their side of the controversy, and are willing to abide by this decision. COMPULSORY INVESTIGATION: THE REMEDY The labor union believes in the doctrine of compulsory investigation as the remedy for the people â the interested third party â to the disputes between capital and labor. Such a law would compel each of the con - testing forces to submit to a board of inquiry the true facts concerning the dispute. The Labor Union would be called upon to show what they were demanding, why they believed such demand to be a just one and what its effect would be upon the industry involved. The employers would be compelled to show why the demands of their workmen were </seg>
            <seg id="p035">35 being refused, to submit his books, records, etc., in evidence as tht means of showing the reason for his refusal. This board would make its report to the public showing the true status of the dispute. No one is bound by this decision the only result being that the people are in a position to sympathize with the party most deserving. In other words, through the power of co-operative sympathetic approval or dis - approval, the innocent suffering third party is afforded a relief for their position in the controversy. SOBRIETY A RESULT OF THE LABOR UNION The labor union, while in its early periods of development, gave its attention exclusively to the question of more wages. Each demand for an added wage being met with a refusal, basing the reasons for a refusal upon the grounds that more wages simply meant more BEER which was detrimental to the health of the workmen. The claims of intemperance of the members of the trades union, at that time, was born in the fact that the union invariably met in a hall adjacent to a saloon. The saloon was recognized as the poor man's club, in that it furnished the means of public assembly, meeting rooms, and the methods of secrecy necessary for the protection of mem - bership as exposure meant the blacklist. The education growing out of the meetings and discussions soon added the second issue in the program of the union movement. Then came the demand for shorter hours, the object of which was the relaxa - tion upon the physical requirements of the workmen and secondly pro - viding leisure for recreation, study and advancement. The results being that in harmony with the development of the union came the increased sobriety of their members. Instead of more beer and more time in which to absorb it we found better and happier homes and a higher standard of manhood and womanhood. With the union meetings grad - ually removed from the saloon until today it is a rare occurrence to find a labor union meeting in or around the saloon. The union as an institution has no quarrel with the saloon, nor the liquor traffic. It neither preaches or teaches prohibition, but its every achievement makes for a higher standard of civilization. Its influence has gone farther in making sober, industrious men and women out of the toilers of America than any other institution. It strikes at the root of the evil by removing the causes of intemperance; namely, poverty, misery, and overtaxed physical endurance which causes the taking on of artificial stimulation. The history of intemperance shows that in any industry or com - munity where the toilers are forced to work long hours for low wages that the signs of the saloon will be found at the very door of the indus - try. That wherever the labor union has gained a foothold in that in - dustry or community that the sign of the saloon has been forced farther and farther away. Moderation in all things is the teachings of the union. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND LABOR r Until recent years organized Christianity has been slow to recognize true relationship between industry and theology. Having failed to understand the true purposes for which labor was striving, namely, "industrial justice.'' Labor's program having been conducted along the lines of true Christianity, insofar as their fundamental purposes were concerned, yet they were apparently drifting farther and farther from Christian organizations. With each great demonstration on the part of the organized toilers, such as the A. R. U. Railroad and the Anthracite Coal strikes, from which developed the great educational effect resulting in the directing of the attention of the church to the righteousness of labor's demands. Then came an organized movement on the part of the church declaring for the cause of labor, when the Methodist ministers and laymen de - clared as follows: "We recognize that the fundamental purpose of the l.abor Move - ment are essentially ethical, and therefore should command the support of Christian men. We recognize further that the organizations df labor is not only the right of the laborers and conductive to their welfare, but is incidental of great benefit to society at large in the securing of bet - ter conditions of work and life in its educational influence upon the great multitude concerned, particularly in the Americanization of our immigrant population." Again the declaration was made: deem it the duty of all Christian jieople to concern themselves directly with certain practical industrial problems, in behalf of the toil - ers of America and those who, by organized effort, are seeking to lift the crushing burdens of the poor, and to reduce the hardships, and up - hold the dignity of labor." LThe department of Church and Labor in th* Presbyterian Church been established for a number of year; under the leadership of the Rev. Charles Stelzle, who is superintendent "f the department and whose early training was that of a union machin'vt, before entering the min - istry, and through whose leadership there h*s been established a system for the exchange of fraternal delegates as between the ministerial unions and the labor unions. In almost every section of the country we find seated in the Central Labor Unions, ministers of the Gospel, and in turn may also be found seated in the Ministerial organizations representa - tives of the Labor Union. The church has taken its stand for a living wage, proper sanitary conditions under which to labor, the regulation of child, woman and </seg>
            <seg id="p037">37 sweat shop labor, the protection of the health, life and limb of the workmen employed in the industry and the establishment of one day's rest in seven. Such being the fundamental aim of the Labor Organiza - tions, hence it will be observed that a closer relationship between the church and labor is speedily being accomplished. The struggle of the labor unions is directed against the power of greed and its subsidiary, "ignorance." Such influences being the chief opponents of civilization, Christianity and those conditons tending to elevate the standard of morality of the human kind. There is, there - fore, one common ground and one united purpose upon which the church and labor should unite in resisting those influences which tend to re - tard the progress of our nation's welfare. Recent developments in Nebraska, tend to show the closer relation between the church and the labor organizations when several union men were called upon to fill the pulpits in many of our leading churches throughout the state. Thus they were enabled to explain in detail the fundamental object of the Trade Union Movement May such relations continue to exist and develop until a true and full understanding may exist between those two great forces, each of which is exerting a world's influence upon those conditions which make life worth the living. AN EXCERPT FROM A REPORT UPON WORKING CONDITIONS IN LINCOLN AS AFFECTING THE FAMILY LIFE OF THE LABORERS (By Rev. Charles E. Carroll.) In the summing up of the statistical information furnished upon those subjects, the Rev. Carroll says: "It is the very exceptional thing to find women commanding the same pay as the men for apparently similar kinds of work. This is especially true in the unorganized trade* t typical example of which is where the union female printers receive .24 per week and non-union females as low as $8.06 per week. While this is no exception to the conditions in other cities, there is a phase of competition that cannot be altogether just to the actual bread winners. I never will be just until what is demanded in some crafts for their women workers, an equal wage for equal work, is de - manded and recognized as a right for all women workers. As it is to - day, it is a phase of the problem of cheap labor. We might ask, why do telephone companies, for instance, insist on breaking the spirit and in the judgment of many authorities of the Nebraska female labor law, in employing female instead of male labor between the hours of ten P. M. and seven A. M.? The general trend of the female cheap labor problem, and where the work required is necessarily the same as when performed by males, it suggsted by a recent press dispatch dated, Philadelphia, March 8, 1912, as follows: "Young and pretty women as street car conductors, it is â¢aid, will be the latest wrinkle to be introduced by the Philadelphia Traction Co." </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 II. A LIVING WAGE. With girls receiving as low as $3.50 a week as wages, while around a dollar a day is the average weekly wage of many, including mothers, the matter of a living wage is in question, or, when men in skilled crafts are able to demand only from $9 to $12 as a weekly wage even when work is steady, the matter of a living wage is again in question. We might ask here, what is meant by living wage; it is a wage earned under proper sanitary conditions and large enough to provide not only for the physical necessities of life, but for a reasonable degree of comfort for the wroker and his family; large enough to provide for the education of his children; for a fair share in the recreation afforded by the community ; for his part' in the support of a church and home-, for provision for his loved ones, through insurance at death, injury and sickness, and for a reasonable competence for old age. Less than this, some day, will not be considered a living wage by society for the average laborer in this country, at least, to begin with in all public utility service, and among all the quasi-public corporations. Although the idea has been assailed as impracticable and absurd by many economists, such a wage, by some process of determination, is absolutely essential to the industrial state even approximately ideal, the laborer should be able to live a reasonably comfortable life on the fruits of his toil. "The laborer is worthy of his hire." We believe some day the state will consider that it is its business to find out what a living wage is and to stand for "the minimum wage in every industry, and that the highest wage that each industry can afford." Without this living wage, the private relief agencies and charity organizations play an important part in the family life of the home of this and every other city. Especially is this true in periods of tem - porary unemployment. III. HOURS OF WORK. The matter of long hours is not a serious question in Lincoln. The expressmen, street car men, gas workers and tailors, beside the Greek shoe shiners, work more than ten hours, the railway employee's irregular hours excepted. It is manifest that the industry which is employing its laborers six days in the week compels them to work twelve hours out of the twenty - four does not give to such employees a proper opportunity for sane and healthy living. Family life, intelligent social intercourse are impossible under such conditions, and the laborer is held in an inferior position, with no chance for development. Such a condition is, we believe, a menace to the well being of the families of any community. We beleive. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">39 too, that the state some day will consider that it is its business to ascer - tain the number of hours which should constitute the mans' day's work. It may not be able to state for all industrial conditions what is a reason - able day's work, but our opinion is that, as far as possible, eight hoars of labor should be considered reasonable and to demand more than tan hours of any employees, except in emergencies, is unjust and unreason- able. IV. SUNDAY WORK. Apparently little unnecessary work is being expected of employees. The general looseness with which one day's rest in seven is being ob - served in Lincoln, however, is only characteristic of the American city. Much of the work that is generally recognized as necessarily continuous could be so arranged that each employee could have at least one day's rest in seven, not necessarily on the Sabbath day nor on the same day as for other employees, railroads, steam and electric, unexcepted. If such an adjustment can be affected in daily newspaper work it can be ef - fected elsewhere. By so adjusting the work, employment would thus be given to a larger number of employees. That this is not generally done, all are aware. A menace to the family life of the community is involved in this condition. We believe it is the right and duty of every man to have one day out of seven for rest and recreation of the body, soul and mind. Furthermore, we believe that it will some day be considered the business of the state to see to it that the employer so arranges his business that not only will a day of rest be provided for, but that a living wage will also be paid and that calculated, not on a seven day, but on a six day basis. V. SANITATION AND MORALS. It is known that in many establishments are found unsanitary and unhealthful conditions, and in several of the industries occupational disease is a natural tendency, a tendency principally toward the great white plague. / The natural consequence of such conditions can be nothing less than to make inroads upon the health and happiness of the family life of all such homes affected. Both our labor and food commissioners, however, are deserving of much credit for their efforts toward the remedying of these unsanitary and unhealthful conditions. Sometimes such wrongs are caused by molten metal, flying dust, overheated or underheated rooms, poor ventilations or poor light. While such conditions are pres- </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 ent in Nebraska, yet we have nothing like the problems of such condi - tions as are prevalent in the large industrial centers of the east. VI. CHILD LABOR. tit seems a question whether or not boys and girls of the ages cover - the child labor law can in justice to the family life of tomorrow, work eight hours during the day and attend school at night. It likely is, how - ever, the most charitable position to be taken under present conditions. What is a greater injustice to the child is to permit him to work long hours per day, having no time at all for school privileges. Still another question of injustice to the child and to the family life of to - morrow is that where children in our midst are permitted to toil at piece work long into the night after a previous full day's toil in order that a few more coppers may be added to the pocket of the unnatural fathers. VII. INDUSTRIAL WAR. Because there is not established a living wage; because there is not established reasonable hours for a day's work, nor reasonable days for a week's work; because there has been so little attention paid to, or adequate compensation made for, the appalling budget of accidents in the industries; because strong fathers have been discharged and their children hired at less than half the pay â we have commercial catastro - phies called strikes â industrial wars. The number of such wars, through - out the country, carried on by the part of organized labor only which is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor for the year ending September 1, 1911, was 1,359; 261 of which were then pending, the total number of such wars for the present year may have exceeded 2,000 â 2,000 industrial wars and a million ruptures in the family life of the CONCLUSION. The industrial life of Nebraska is only a small part of that more significant industrial life of the nation and of the world â the great "Labor Movement." We believe that this movement carries in its heart with all its mistakes, an unconquerable desire to realize brotherhood in the working world. We believe that the three interested factions to nearly every labor dispute â the employee, the employer, and the public â should more closely stand together in directing the labor movement always in the channel of service and in not allowing it ever to go unre - stricted or disrupted in any quarter. We believe, however, that under </seg>
            <seg id="p041">BUREAU OF LABOR 41 existing relations there is, and perhaps under any relations there will be reason for the regulation of the fact, that social and industrial dis - content in itself may be only an indication of social and industrial progress. Â» Therefore, "let us hasten the time when a mutual sympathetic under - nding and relationship shall exist between these three great parties production and consumption! Let us do what we can to hasten the time for sending all strikes and lockouts to the scrap heap of discarded barbarities by creating some kind of adequate machinery for making the same both unjustifiable and unnecessary! Let us do what we can to hasten the coveted time for a working world brotherhood!" </seg>

            <seg id="p056">Nebraska's Industrial Survey 1912 rThe Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics herewith presents to people of Nebraska the results of our industrial survey. Such re - port shows the magnitude of the manufacturing, wholesale, retail, rail - roads, transportation, including street car and teaming industries. Also showing the relation of the wage earners, employed in such industries, including domestics, farm hands, etc., together with the wages, hours, sanitation, safety appliances, cost of living, with the general moral and health conditions, as well as their influences upon social, industrial and home life. We present this information believing - that the conservation of human health, life, limb and happiness is one of the state's chief duties. That as a means of doing so, successfully, scientifically and economically we must first have learned the true conditions as well as the means nec - essary for effecting a remedy. SOURCES OF INFORMATION. The sources of information upon which this survey is based con - ticts of personal canvass, inspections, sworn statements from employers, certified reports from individuals, unions, corporations and the several organizations and bureaus having jurisdiction over certain classes of employees, such as the State Board of Education, church organizations, State, County and City official records. This survey having consumed eighteen months' labor on the part of this bureau. REPORT. In the aggregate, Nebraska has 187,345 wage earners, of whom 145,894 are males and 41,340 females, with 311 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years. Of the total number of wagÂ« earners, 5.3 per cent belong to trade unions, while in the skilled crafts 34.6 per cent belong to the trade unions, with less than 100 females affiliated with the trade union movement. The average monthly wage of the male employees was $59.05, while the females averaged $40.82, with the males working an average of 9 1-4 hoars per day and the females 8 1-2 hours. In the trades union group, which consists of 10,015 persons, we find an average monthly wage of 184.24, with an average of 9 hours constituting a day's labor. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">55 INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS. During the period of one year from October 1, 1911, to and includ - ing September, 1912, there was reported to this Bureau 318 industrial accidents, of which 58 were fatal, thus giving us an average of one acci - dent for every working day, with one death for every 5.3 days, such record being baaed upon an approximate one-half of accidents occurring, as the law only requires that accidents of a serious nature and which will cause a lota of two weeks' time shall be reported to this Bureau. Of this number of accidents, but 8 occurred on the farms, which amounts to 2.5 per cent, or one accident out of every 39 that occurred in the Nebraska industries which may be charged to the farming indus - try. The greatest number of fatalities were found to have occurred on the railroads, while the electrical current stands as a close second. OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE. KPhis phase of Nebraska's industrial life, as it applies to the wage ng class, constitutes one of the most important subjects and one which has hertofore been sadly neglected, owing to the lack of informa - tion or knowledge upon the subject. The industrial poisons which are responsible for our occupational diseases, as found in the industries, were *m follows: Acetaldehyde, Ammonia, Cyanogen, Lead, Tar poi - sons and Nitrous Gases. The industries in which those poisons were found were vinegar factories, mirror factories, tanning, beet sugar fac - tories, artificial ice, electro plating, smelting and refining, paint manu - facturing, painting, printing, gas plants, packing industry, department stores, laundries and hide houses. Giving us a total of 331 concerns, em - ploying 8,940 persons who were subject to and coming in contact with such poisons. It should be borne in mind that the damage resulting ti occupational poisoning develops slowly and in after life even to next generation. AVERAGE COST OF LIVING OF THE WAGE EARNER. I The cost of living of the wage earners becomes an essential feature this survey for the reason that the wage standard largely regulates the condition of life under which the wage earners of any country exist. As a means of determining the cost of living in the industrial centers of Nebraska, namely, Omaha, South Omaha, Lincoln, Beatrice, Hastings, Fremont and Nebraska City, we have secured the services of several families in each locality, who through the aid of the family budget, kept an itemized record of every item consumed in the family's cost of maintenance. The family of five persons was taken as a standard, as the census shows that five persons constitute the average sised family. The reports show the following average of the different items and the cost of living as follows, which is based upon the minimum cost of livinxr of the seven cities above mentioned, and is as follows: House </seg>

As a means of condensing the scope of general information upon each of the various groups of wage earners, we have divided the total group into forty-three distinct classes, groups or industries, for the pur - pose of showing the total number of wage earners of each group, their average wages, hours, sanitary conditions, provisions for the safe guarding of health, life, limb, etc. BAKERS AND CONFECTIONERS. Lin this industry we have 291 concerns, which represents the retail es - shments and are the amount over and above the wholesale bakers and confectioners which are grouped in the manufacturers class. We have 342 wage earners, of whom 254 are males and 84 females with 4 chil - dren between the ages of 14 and 16 years, with the males working an average of 12 hours per day, with an average wage of $48 and the fe - males work 10 hours with an average wage of $32. IThe sanitary conditions in the bakeries, as a class, were found to somewhat below the normal, owing to the fact that many were lo - fd in basements and such other places where ventilation was poor BARBERS AND PORTERS In this trade we have 1,026 concerns employing 2,812 persona, of whom 2,789 were males, and 23 females, working an average of 12 hours t' the males and 10 for the females, with an average wage of $48 each, e general sanitary conditions are found to be good, the great prob - lem being the long hours and low wages, as it was found in many in- Kes that the workmen were compelled to labor for 14 and 15 hours Saturday, where their labors were of the trying character. BARTENDERS AND PORTERS In this group we have 1,164 concerns, employing 2,246 wage earn - ers, all of whom are males, earning an average monthly wage of $64.50, with an eight hour work day. The sanitary conditions were found to be somewhat below the normal, owing to the fact that the workmen come in contact with wet floors, etc., while the moral atmosphere was not of the beat. </seg>
            <seg id="p059">57 BILL POSTERS. There were found to be 9 concerns in this industry, employing 28 persons, all of whom were males earning an average monthly wage of $69, with a 9 hour work day. POOL HALLS AND BOWLING ALLEYS. We have 146 concerns, employing 262 persons, 257 of whom wert adults, with 5 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years, with an average monthly wage of Â¥46.80, with a ten hour work day. The five children were found to be employed in bowling alleys, as pin boys, be - ing employed after school hours, and within the limitations of the law. BLACKSMITHS AND HORSESHOERS. iWe have 891 concerns, employing 1,320 wage earners, all of whom males, earning an average wage of $66.22, with a ten hour work day. BOOKKEEPERS AND ACCOUNTANTS In this line we have 1,063 concerns, employing 2,471 persons, of whom 1,508 were males and 963 females. The males earning an average monthly wage of $59.20, with the females earning $42.05, 9 hours con - stituting a day's labor. BUILDING INDUSTRIES. In this industry we have 1,280 concerns, employing 19,302 persons, 19,278 of whom are males, with 24 females, who are confined to office work. The males earning an average monthly wage of $67.20, the fe - males, $48, with a 9 hour work day. In this industry we found the necessity for the enforcement of the building and inspection law in many instances, which provides for the protection and safety of per - sons in and about the construction, repairing, alteration or removal of buildings, bridges, viaducts and other structures, that all scaffolds, hoists, cranes, stays, ladders, supports or other mechanical contrivances shall be properly safeguarded and substantially built in a manner to guarantee the safety of the workmen. That all floors shall be arched between the beams thereof, that temporary floors shall be carried at all times, and that the carrying weight shall be of a sufficient strength. As this class of inspection is limited to buildings of specific dimen - sions, the law is therefore confined to but a few towns within the state, and the inspections are of a class where record is unnecessary and were therefore confined to oral orders issued by the inspector making such in - spections. the building industry the most hazardous class is the iron work - industry, where it is impossible to successfully arrange for safety devices necessary for the protection of life. In the building industry we </seg>
            <seg id="p060">58 have 16 serious accidents reported, which was 5 per cent of the total number of accidents reported throughout the entire state. In the painters' trade we found 94 concerns employing 672 persons who came in contact with lead poison, none of which were of a serious nature. The hours were found to be good in the building industry, especial - ly in the organized towns, which were confined to Omaha, South Omaha and Lincoln, where the average work day was but a fraction over 8 BUTCHER WORKMEN tin this industry we have 432 institutions employing 642 persons, of whom were males, and 2 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years, who were employed as delivery boys. This class of butcher work - men represent the retail establishments which employ wage earners, the packing house workmen being listed in the manufacturing- class. The wages were found to average $60.20 per month, with a 9 hoar work day. The sanitary conditions were slightly below normal, owing to the fact of the necessity of going into ice boxes, which in hot weather causes a sudden change in temperature from extreme hot to cold. But two accidents were reported in this industry. DOMESTIC SERVANTS. In the line of domestic service, we found 6,116 employers, employ - ing 6,769 persons, of whom 28 were males, 16 of whom were Japanese, 5 Chinese, 2 colored and 5 native citizens, with 6,740 females, one girl being between the age of 14 and 16 years. The average wages of the males was $20 and the females $16 per month, which includes board and lodging. The hours constituting a day's labor was placed at 10, but the fact of their living at their place of employment developed the necessity for added cares covering a period far byond the 10 hour work day. The subordination of employment, the care of children added to the household duties, the lack of accommodations necessary for the entei - tainment of company, in a great measure makes this claas of employ - ment an unpopular one. The liberty afforded in factories, office and shop employment, together with the associations and the opportunity for dress and social attainment so completely overshadows the domestic employment as to cause the shunning of this class of labor. Our con - clusions having been arrived at after a very careful study and pains - taking investigation on the part of this department. kThe moral and sanitary surroundings of domestic employment was d to be good, with but one industrial accident chargeable to this DRESS MAKING. In the dress making industry we have 1364 concerns employing </seg>
            <seg id="p061">59 2,728 persons, all of whom were females, working a nine hour day, for an average monthly wage of $36.40. Re continuous, tedious and tiresome duties of this class of employ - ills upon the women who follow the business for any considerable of time. EXPRESS COMPANIES. We have four companies employing 594 persons, 586 of whom are males, with 8 females, who do office work. The males receiving an average monthly wage of $60.65, while the females receive $49-27, with a 9 and 8 hour work day, respectively. FARM LABORERS. Lin the farming industry we have 19,310 employers employing 27,774 es with a ten hour work day, earning an average monthly wage of $46.40, which includes therein, board, lodging, washing and mending. In this class we do not include either the farm owners or the tenant farmers, but just the wage earners, or as commonly called, the farm hands. This does not include the occasional employee, but that class which is employed the year around. To this industry we find chargeable 8 industrial accidents, thus showing that but 2.5 per cent of the total accidents occurred on the farm. The moral, health and sanitary conditions were found to be good. HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS We have 5,892 establishments, employing 12,761 persons, of whom 6,119 were males, 6,602 females and 40 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years, most of whom were employed as bell boys, coming within the scope of the law regulating such employment. The wages of the male employees was $46.80 and the females $30.60, with a 10 hour work day. In this wage is included board and in many instances room also. The bulk of the females are employed as waitresses and chamber - maids, the sanitary surroundings, as a rule, were found to be normal, with the moral tendencies far below the average. INSURANCE EMPLOYEES. tFour hundred and eighty insurance concerns, employing 1,354 per - s, of whom 1,241 were males and 113 females, were found in Ne - braska. In this class were not included the home companies, which were listed in another column.

            <seg id="p062">60 MAMFACTIRIXG INDUSTRY In the manufacturing industries we have 1,109 institutions, repre - senting 104 kinds of manufacturing concerns, employing 22,886 per - sons, of whom 19,373 were men, 3,362 women and 161 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years. The average monthly wage of the males was $59.48, while the fe - males was $38.40, which is based upon steady time, while the facts show that in some of the industries, such as the packing and slaughter - ing, that the average loss of employment to be almost 1-3 time lost through sickness and lack of employment. The average hours consti - tuting a day's labor for the men being 9 1-4, and for the women, 8 1-2. While space will not permit of our going into the details of each and every manufacturing concern, nor of every kind of factory, yet we will attempt to show that class which presents conditions outside of the normal. Elsewhere will be found table giving report by industry. The Broom Industry presents a very striking feature owing to the fact that we have one very large concern employing- convict labor com - ing in direct competition with the employees of free labor. We have 14 broom factories employing a total of 475 wage earners, 441 of whom are males, 23 females, and 11 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years. With the male employees in the free factories working 10 hour* per day for an average monthly wage of $41.25, the convicts earn a monthly wage, which goes to the state, of $13.20 for a 7 hour work day, under the task system. Gas and Electricity furnishes one of the most hazardous classes of employment, there being 65 concerns employing 720 persons, of whom 697 are males and 23 females. The males earning an average monthly wage of $66 per month, while the females earn $42 per month, with a 9 hour work day for the men and 8 hours for the women. In this industry we have 44 industrial accidents, for the fiscal year. We have 34 gas plants employing 147 persons, who come in contact with industrial poisons, "Tar Poisons" and "Nitrous Gases," 44 of whom have lost time on account of such poisons to the extent of 308 days. 5 Slaughtering and M e at Packing Industries are the largest employers labor in the manufacturing group, employing 6,640 persons, of whom 6,366 are males, 266 females and 12 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years. The males earning an average monthly wage of $63.60, with the females earning $34.80 per month. This estimate being based upon full time employment, while the facts show that the employees lose, on an average, 1-4 time through the lack of employment. In this industry we have but 3 persons reported as having sus - tained serious injury, 2 of whom proved fatal, being the result of elec - trocution, which is 3.4 per cent of the fatalities of the entire state, while they employ 3.5 per cent of the total number of wage earners in the state. We found 3,073 persons coming in contact with "Nitrous Gases," which was of slight degree, with reasonable precaution being taken to overcome any dangerous results. </seg>
            <seg id="p063">61 Smelting and Refining Industry which consists of but one concern, employing 626 persons, of whom 625 are males and one female employed â¢t office work. The average working hours being 12 hours per day, with an average monthly wage of $56.40. In this industry we found 507 persons coming in contact with "Lead Poison," which is of a very dangerous character. In the column of industrial accidents we found 3 fatalities, which is 5.1 per cent of the total number in the state, with 5 serious accidents reported upon, while this concern employs but .3 per cent of the total number of employees in the entire state. Sugar Beet Industry is comprised of two concerns, - which employ* 630 persons, of wlym 625 are males, with 5 females employed at office rrk. The men earning a monthly wage of $62.40, with quite a loss time, as the factories are not running full time. In this industry 5 persons were found who came in contact with "Ammonia Poisons'," causing a loss of 3 days' time, but not of a serious MARBLE AND GRANITE WORKERS. Ehave 64 concerns in this industry, employing 192 persons, all are males, earning an average monthly wage of $64.80, with work day. In this class we have included marble and granite ments, marble cutters, polishers, setters, etc. MESSENGERS. EVe have 8 concerns, employing 64 persons, all of whom are males, one boy between the age of 14 and 16. The average monthly wage _ $28 per month, with a 9 hour work day. In this industry we found the larger percentage of the employees bordering very closely upon the child labor age, the majority being below the age of 20 years. The moral atmosphere under which messengers are employed being very bad, owing to the fact that they come in contact with the very lowest classes. This industry, as well as the boys engaged in the sale of newspapers, be - ing of a very dangerous class, but the department found itself without the warrant of law necessary to remedy the conditions found in those classes of employment. MILLINERS. In the millinery industry we have 1,507 concerns employing 2,014 persons, all of whom are females, earning an average monthly wage of $36.40, with a 9 hour work day. The cont : nuous, tedious and tiresome duties of this class of employment shows upon the women who follow this occupation for any considerable length of time. We found that during certain seasons of the year that a certain percentage of the em - ployers were inclined to work their girls in excess of the ten hour </seg>
            <seg id="p064">62 period as prescribed by law, several complaints having been lodged with this department during the past year. a small percentage of the women employed in this industry are rded steady work the year around. MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL. Cln this class of employment we found 3,947 institutions and churches oying 3,212 ministers, all of whom were males, earning an average monthly wage of $66.91, with an average daily working period of 8 hours. Included in this wage, in many instances, is house rent, etc., which often brings the wages below the average so far as the cash remunera - tion is concerned. MUSICIANS AND MUSIC TEACHERS. tin this class of work we found 680 employers, employing 960 per - s, 651 of whom were males and 309 females, with the males earning average monthly wage of $56, while the females earn $42.75, with average working day of 6 hours. PHOTOGRAPHERS. tin this line of employment we have 92 concerns, employing 201 per - is, 168 of whom are males and 32 females, with one child between the â s of 14 and 16 years. The males earning an average monthly salary $50 and the females $40.20, with an average working day of 8 hours. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. STATE DEPARTMENTS. The state departments, 30 in number, were found to be employing 242 people, of whom 167 were males and 75 were females, with the male* earning an average monthly wage of $141.28, while the females receive $78.50, working an 8 hour work day. This class of employment shows the highest wage standard of any group of employees within the state, such being due to the fact that in the male group is included the heads of ah state departments, and it is needless to say that from a moral, sanitary and congenial viewpoint is the most pleasant class of employ - ment. Campaign contributions and physical exertion in the interest of political preferment would in many instances materially reduce the wage standard and add to the working hours. STATE INSTITUTIONS. The state institutions, 15 in number, employ 641 persons, 464 of whom art male* and 177 females, with the males earning an average </seg>
            <seg id="p065">63 monthly wage of $66.02, while the females average (30.82, with a 9 hour work day. In this group are included all of the state institutions, heads of such institutions, and in the majority of cases board and room may be added to the wage standard, which would materially increase the wages, but the information upon this point was so unreliable that we have not included such items. From the health and moral standpoint this class of employment does not compare in any measure with the state departments, while the hours are far in excess of the state departments. COUNTY EMPLOYEES. Ee have 92 counties, employing 1,912 employees, of whom 1,698 are and 214 females, with the males earning an average monthly of $87, while the females earn but $49.60, with an 8 hour work day. In this group is included the heads of all departments, down to the minor employees, which in the larger counties constitute quite a number of employees, thus bringing the average of the county depart - ments far below the general average of the state departments, which in every other way compares very favorably with such departments. MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES. In this group we have 12 cities employing 1,212 persons, 1,002 of whom were males, 210 females, with the males earning an average monthly wage of $72, while the females earn but $42, with an average work day of 8 hours. In this group is included the municipal street em - ployees, which materially reduces the average wage as compared with the county employees, all other conditions corresponding favorably with county and state institutions. RAILWAY EMPLOYEES. tWe have 7 railraods within the state, employing 26,667 persons, 26,- I of whom were males, 482 females, with 5 children between the ages 14 and 16 years, with the males earning an average monthly wage of $67.59, while the females earn $46.73, their labors being confined princi - pally to office work. The males work an average of 10 hours per day. while the females work 9 hours. In this group is included train man, track men, postal clerks, and all classes of employees connected in and about the railway service, excepting telegraph operators and express tpany employees. The five children were found to be employd as of - boys in the Burlington and Union Pacific headquarters. REAL ESTATE, RENTALS AND LOANS. We have 1,064 concerns, employing 1,864 persons, of whom 1,221 were males and 642 females, with one child between the age of 14 and 16 years, employed at office work. The males earn an average monthly </seg>
            <seg id="p066">64 wage of $58.40, while the females earn $41.10, being employed in the of - fice department with all working an average of 9 hours per day. RETAIL CLERKS. ri'e have 4,576 concerns, employing 8,206 persons, 4,022 of whom males, 4,132 were females, with 52 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years. The males earning an average monthly wage of $48, while the females earn $23.60, working an average of 9 hours per day. In this group of employees we have one of the greatest problems with which this department is called upon to deal. The low wages, long hours, poor sanitary conditions and high nervous tension, together with the moral atmosphere, all of which presents a problem which calls for the most earnest efforts of society in working out a solution of the prob - lems presented in the retail industry as found in our large cities. With an average of $22.60 per month and an approximate cost of living of $26.50 per month, coupled with the fact that this class of employees are forced to come up to a standard of dress and personal appearance, shows us very conclusively that this is a problem and one which is bound to leave its mark upon any community where such conditions are tolerated. It is unnecessary for us to attempt to go into this matter further or to present the remedy, as the facts are so flagrant as to suggest but one conclusion, namely, laws fixing the minimum wage standard. SCHOOL TEACHERS. We have 7,005 schools employing 10,968 teachers, 1,306 of whom were males and 9,662 females, earning an average monthly wage of $57.25, wtih a 6 hour work day. In this group we find the period of employment averaging less than 9 months per year, which would ma - terially reduce the average yearly wage as compared with other groups of employees in this survey. SHOEMAKERS AND REPAIRERS tin this group we have 192 concerns, employing 214 persons, 213 of m were males, with one child between the age of 14 and 16 years, loyed as a delivery boy, earning a monthly wage of $49.12 with a 9 hour work day. This group consists of the retail concerns doing custom and repair work, and does not include concerns who do manufacturing, such being included in our manufacturing group. SHOE SHINERS. tie have 94 shining parlors, employing 325 persons, all of whom males, earning an average monthly wage of $20, working a 12 work day. This industry is composed principally of Greeks and Â«*, the majority of whom range in age from 16 to 20 yean. The problem with the Greek shining parlors being the system under </seg>
            <seg id="p067">BUREAU OF LABOR 65 which the boys are brought to this country, whereby their employers have advanced their transportation from the old country, which they work out, and which requires practically two years' service to pay back. The proprietor of such shining parlors compelling the boys to turn over all tips given to them by the customers, so that taking into account the wages paid and the tips received, the employer receives their services practically gratis. The condition under which they live, which is the standard of the old country, where 10 to 15 live, cook, sleep and eat in one room, presents a sanitary condition far below the. normal, while the law does not permit of our supervision in this matter. The matter of the system under which the Greek shining boys are brought to this country, their conditions of life and employment, the question of the receiving of their tips, a better wage and time in which to receive schooling was taken up by this department with the Greek minister, who in turn laid the matter before his home government, re - sulting in slightly improved conditions, but we feel that there is yet room for great improvement. STATIONARY ENGINEERS AND FIREMEN. We have 2,903 institutions, employing 3,241 persons, all of whom are males, earning an average monthly wage of $58.64, with a 12 hour work day and a 7 day week. In this industry we find the sanitary conditions to be far below the normal, owing to the fact that the majority of engine and boiler rooms are under ground, where light and ventilation is poor. The continuous grind of a 12 hour work day, with the average of the men working 7 days a week, forces a condition which would, in our judgment, demand a remedy, which should be legislative, establish - ing a short hour work day, with one days' rest in seven. The import - ance of the position held by the men who move the wheels of industry and who guard the lives of the people coming in contact with the insti - tutions over which they preside most certainly is worthy of a greater consideration than that which they are receiving. LAUNDRY WORKERS, STEAM. In this industry we have 78 concerns, employing 1,264 persons, 409 of whom were males and 843 females, with 12 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years. The males earning an average monthly wage of $48, while the females earn $27.88, with a 9 1-2 hour work day. In this in - dustry we again find a condition somewhat similar to the retail clerks, where the women workers are working long and unreasonable hours for low and unreasonable wages, where the sanitary conditions are very poor and where physical endurance is the chief essential in holding their em - ployment.. During the hot summer months the labors of the female laundry workers are almost unbearable because of the extreme heat and physical labor necessary to perform the duties of the task assigned. The inspector gave much time to this industry, forcing the employers to </seg>
            <seg id="p068">66 install vent fans and better sanitary equipments wherever possible, as well as the safeguarding of the dangerous machinery. In this industry we again find the necessity for a law establishing the minimum wage and the reduction of the limitation of hours from 10 to 8 per day. Twelve children were found in laundries who were between the ages of 14 and 16 years, engaged in feeding mangles, all of whom held permits from the school superintendent, which established their right to employment so far as this bureau is concerned, but it is our judgment that no child be - low the age of sixteen should be permitted to work in any capacity in or about this industry. STREET AND ELECTRICAL RAILWAY EMPLOYEES. We have 3 electrical railways, employing 1,533 persons, 1,521 of whom were males, with 12 females, employed at office work, with the males earning an average monthly wage of $72.23 and the females $55.32, with the males working 11 1-2 hours a day and the females 8, with the males working a 7 day week, which again suggests the necessity for a law requiring one day's rest in seven, for the reason that this class of employment is of a nerve racking kind, especially in view of the num - ber of hours, continuous service, which they render each and .every day, month in and month out. TAILORS. EWe have 231 concerns employing 332 persons, of whom 307 were :s and 25 females, with the males earning an average monthly wage 48.92, and the females $32.30, with a 10 hour work day. TEAMING INDUSTRY. I In this industry we have 3,940 concerns, employing 5,550 persons, of whom are males, earning an average monthly wage of $48.63, with 0 hour work day. TELEGRAPH EMPLOYEES. I We have 2 companies, employing 321 persons, 220 of whom were es and 94 females, with 7 children betwen the ages of 14 and 16 rs, with the males earning an average monthly wage of $70.05, the females $46.89, with a 9 hour work day. The 7 children were found to be employed in the delivery of messages, holding certificates from the school superintendents as provided by law. TELEPHONE EMPLOYEES. We have 4 concerns, employing 1,934 persons, 953 of whom were males and 981 females, with the males earning an average monthly wage of $66.26 and the females $30.58, with the males working a 9 hour day </seg>
            <seg id="p069">67 and the females 8. The female employees are principally employed as exchange girls and the males being employed in the construction and maintenance service of the system. THEATRE AND MOVING PICTURE EMPLOYEES. In this industry we have 640 institutions, employing 942 persons, 72] of whom were males, 221 females, with the males earning an average monthly wage of $64 and the females $42.80, with an 8 hour work day. TRAVELING SALESMEN. We have 3,071 concerns, "within the state, employing 5,162 persons, all of whom are males, earning an average monthly wage of $84.31, averaging 10 hours per day. In this class is not included persons who live outside of the state and who travel a part or all of the time within the state, but includes simply those who are residents of and are em - ployed a part or all the time within the state. WELL DRILLERS AND DIGGERS. In this line we have 294 concerns, employing 586 persons, all of whom are males, and who earn an average monthly wage of $61.75, with a 9 hour work day. In this class is included those who are employed in the erection of wind mills, well cleaners, etc. WHOLESALE INDUSTRIES. We have 372 wholesale establishments, employing 3,322 persons, 2,726 of whom were males and 578 females, with 18 children between the ages of 14 and 16 years. The males earn an average monthly wage of $50, while the females earn $37.60, with a 9 hour work day. The fe - male employees are employed in office work, while the children employed in this industry were employed in office work in messenger service. DEPARTMENT OF INSPECTIONS. This department has made over 1,864 inspections and re-inspections of factories, workshops and mills with respect to their sanitary condi - tions, safeguarding of machinery, etc. Have issued over 3,000 specific orders for the safeguarding of the various kinds of machinery. Have inspected 2,220 mercantile, retail and wholesale institutions with respect to their sanitary conditions, having issued 460 specific orders, and have investigated the conditions of employment of both women and children with respect to hours, wages, sanitary conditions under which they labor, together with the moral atmosphere surrounding their conditions of em - ployment. have made inspections of 320 theatres and moving picture houses reference to their means of exit in case of fire, construction of </seg>
            <seg id="p070">68 moving picture booths, having issued 64 specific orders on this class of institutions. Inspections have been made upon 3,610 buildings over three stories in height, with reference to fire escapes, resulting in the ordering of escapes upon 308 buildings for outside iron stair escapes and 2,105 auto - matic metallic escapes. Eighty-four buildings have been inspected under the building inspec - tion law, with reference to the safeguarding of the lives of employees, resulting in 34 specific orders for the compliance of the provisions of said law. CHILD LABOR. Th records show that Nebraska has 311 children employed in her in - dustrial activities, who are between the ages of 14 and 16 years of age, all of whom hold certificates of employment as provided for by law. Dur - ing the course of our inspections and industrial survey we came in con - tact with 34 cases where children were being employed contrary to the law, and without employment certificates, but in every instance they either secured the proper permits or were, by their employers, discharged from said employment. Rthe beet fields we found a condition of child employment which closely upon a fracture of the law, and yet the law is not broad in its scope to permit of the stopping of such employment. We found that among the Russian beet growers in the western part of the state that the family contracts to care for a certain number of acres of beets, thereby becoming the employer, so that it is imposcsible to deter - mine whether or not the children are being employed in violation of the statutory provision. The percentage of children employed in our industries is gradually decreasing, owing to the fact that the law limits the work day for chil dren to 8 hours, while those industries which employ children are found to be the ones which exact long hours and low wages, and therefore find it more profitable to employ adults whom they can work the full limit for practically the same wage allawed the children. The great problem confronting our state, so far as child labor is concerned, is the growing system of home employment. The home sweat shop production which includes within its scope children of tender age. Throughout the state we have several concerns who employ, in con - nection with their factories, the extended home sweating system. The work of such concerns is based upon the piece work system. When the children have worked the 8 hours, as permitted by law, they then retire to their homes, taking with them the materials necessary to continue their labors well into the wee hours of the night, thereby increasing the revenues of their labors under the direction of parental sanction. This same system also applies to the women workers, who have labored the re - quisite 10 hours per day as permitted by law, then they transfer their operations to the home, where the state's interference is secure. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">69 The power of the law is invoked to protect children against a parent who is cruel, greedy, or so ignorant as to be willing to sacrifice their health and lives for gain in the factory, workshop, mill or store. He may, not take his children out of school to work for another, because these things are inhuman, they are injurious to childhood and therefore against public policy. But a parent may claim the services of his chil - dren from the day their baby hands are capable of performing a task, providing the work is done at home. The remarkable distinction which permits people to do to their own children and to their own person that which the law prohibits them from doing to others, is the survival of the theory of the sacredness of the home. The traditional theory that the home is an institution which does not change, and which, therefore, ought not to be invaded or interfered with in any event. True, manufacturing used to be properly and successfully carried on in the home. This new system of home sweating proposes the carrying of the home into the factory. The true purpose of which is the evasion of the child and female labor laws as applying to our factory life. FEMALE LABOR. K Nebraska has 41,340 female wage workers employed in her industrial , who earn an average monthly wage of $40.82, with an average work day of 8 1-2 hours. The inequality of the wage standard as between the male and female workers who perform the same service presents a problem very danger - ous to the industrial employees of our state, for the .reason that wherever it is found that the female workers are capable of an equal service the wage standard of the male is gradually forced to the level of the female worker so that the infllence is felt throughout the entire industry in which they are employed. The effect of the lowering of the standard of wages and the increas- ing of the number of hours has its effect upon the standards of educa - tion and recreation. The low standard of wages among the female work - ers, which is accepted owing to the non-dependence of those living at home, is another aid to the establishment of a wage below the possible cost of living of the class of women who must live exclusively off of the sale of their labors as a means of maintaining themselves and their de - pendents. In other words, the girls who are simply working for pin money and who are therefore only temporarily interested in their jobs and who are willing to accept low wages, long hours and unsanitary con - ditions surrounding their employment. The very fact of which forces those who are dependent upon such class of employment to accept the standard established by those who are unconcerned in the future of that particular class of employment. The only practical remedy for the grievances of the female workers would be the passage of a law establishing a minimum wage which should be commensurative with the reasonable cost of living. </seg>

            <seg id="p079">77 The above table upon the cost of living was prepared upon scien - tific information obtained through the keeping of "The Family Budget," by families selected from the towns indicated representing those receiv - ing the minimum standard wage, each family consisting of five per - sons, which is the average sized family as shown by the Census Bureau. The minimum cost of living, for the individual, was found to ap - proximate $26.50 per month, which was divided as follows: Room rent $8, board $12, clothing $1.60, doctor's bill and medicines 80c, amuse - ments $1.40, laundry $1.10, incidentals $1.60. The cost of the individual is based upon the lowest possible standard of maintenance and is the class in which department store clerks, factory workers, etc., belong who do not live at home and whose wages are oft times found to be far below this standard. There was found to be an intermediate grade coming between the two classes as above noted, namely, first, the family of five persons as noted in the table "average cost of living" and the minimum cost of liv - ing of the individual; second, the widow with three or four children, who is attempting to keep her little flock together, living in one or two rooms, with the cost of rent, clothing, etc., very slightly in advance of the individual and which was found to approximate $31.50 for three per - sons. A very significant feature in dealing with this problem is the fact that the cost of living, invariably, increases proportionately with the wage standard, the above figures developing two very important feat - ures, namely: First, that a high wage standard increases proportion - ately the family standard of living. While a reduction in hours increases their standard of recreation, education and enjoyment. Second, the standard of wages among the female workers, which is accepted owing to the non-dependence of those who live at home, thus establishing a wage below the possible cost of living of those women who must live ex - clusively off of the sale of their labor, thus maintaining themselves and their family. In other words, the girls who are simply working for money and are therefore only temporarily interested in the job and are willing to accept low wages, long hours and unsanitary surround - ings. The very fact of their doing so forcing those who are dependent upon such employment to accept the standard established by those un - concerned in the future of such class of employment. Thus do we find the relations between the cost of living and a comparative wage unequal in their relations to each other. A widow, who kept a family budget and who objects to having her name made public, offers a very practical solution of the high cost of living and the low wage standard. Her report being as follows: "We have a four roomed house with a full lot, 60x130 feet, for which we pay a rental of $15. We have an excellent garden, which has supplied oar table with an abundance of vegetables and there is still a good variety in the ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">78 BIENNIAL REPORT "We have a cow for which pasture costs $1.50 per month and instead 01" paying: $10 a month for butter, as we formerly did, we now have the churning. We have abandoned the canned milk, which previously cost us $2 per month, and we now have seven or eight quarts .Ik per day, four of which we sell, which amounts to the feed nec - essary for the maintenance of the cow. fVe have chickens, which supply eggs for our table and enough addi - to pay for their feed. We will have cabbage, vegetables und canned off of the fruit trees and shrubbery which, together with the butter and eggs, affords us a tremendous saving in our grocery The question of the standard of living of the American laborer is in contrast with the European wage earning class and is a dangerous influence which is continually being brought about by foreign immi - grants, who are content to maintain the European standard of living while competing with the American workmen for the jobs. This estab - lishes a margin .between the wage and living standard making possible the reduction in wages, thus forcing the American workmen to the European standard of living. The second feature bearing upon this question is the ever increasing standard of rents, clothing, etc., in the different localities in which the workmen may reside. Wherever the cost of living is found to be below the average cost of rent, food, etc., will be found to be proportionately low; on the other hand, wherever the wage standard is above the average their rents, food, etc., will be found to be higher just in harmony with the wage standard. The standard of the industrial and economic prosperity of the toil - ers, of any community, reflects the moral virtues of the citizenship there - of. Every condition tending to lower the wage, lengthen the hours, re - duce the standard of living, or the tolerating of unsanitary production, </seg>

            <seg id="p093">BUREAU OF LABOR 91 F above table is prepared under the provisions of the factory in - law which provides as follows: "Section 10. It shall be the duty of the owners or su- erintendents of all factories, workshops, mills, or mercan - ile establishments to report in writing to the Labor Com - missioner or his Deputy, all fatal accidents within forty - ight hours after their occurence; and all accidents which revent the injured person or persons from returning to rork within one week after the expiration of such two weeks, be reported in writing by the person in charge of uch establishment or place to the said Labor Commis - ioner or his Deputy, stating as fully as possible the cause of such accident." The fact that this law provides only for the reporting of fatal and serious accidents excluding all minor injuries gives us but about 50 per cent of the actual injuries occuring in our industries. I am firmly persuaded to the idea that the law should be so amended as to provide for the reporting of all classes of accidents occuring in the industries for the reason that it is upon this information that we are able to determine the necessities for and the kind of safe guards necessary for the prevention of such accidents, so far as it may be possible to safe guard such machinery. This report gives us 318 accidents which have occurred in our indus - tries in twelve consecutive months with 68 fatalities or 18.3 per cent. The total loss of time occasioned through accident being 5,676 days, which, based upon an average daily wage of $2.50, would make a total loss of wages of $14,190. Summing the situation up from another angle we find that our industrial accidents during a period of twelve months from October 1, 1911, to and including September, 1912, has caused the maiming of 313 persons, the loss of the lives of 58 persons with a loss of wages of $14,190. Thus giving us an average of one accident every working day with one death for every 5.3 days and this record being made upon approximately but one-half of the accidents which have occurred during this period. This report dates from October, 1911, owing to the fact that the law took effect on June 8, 1911, it requiring the remainder of the time to prepare the blanks, instructions, etc., necessary for the reporting of said accidents, the report being closed on October, 1912, the date of this bulletin going to press. A careful comparison of this report, by months, will show that the accidents have gradually decreased, such being due to the safeguarding and precautionary methods employed in our industrial life. For illus - tration, in the montth tof October, 1911, we have 87 injuries reported upon while in September, 1912, we have but 20 reports and this after a closer observance of the law together with a more universal reporting by the concerns coming within the scope of this act. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">92 OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES AND INDUS - TRIAL POISONS INJURIOUS TO THE HEALTH OF THE WORKMEN AS FOUND IN NEBRASKA'S INDUSTRIES LThe Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics has fof its purpose protection of the life, health, and limb of the workmen, exposed to dangerous machinery, industrial poisons and occupational diseases. The result of industrial poisons in the various industries, as here given, being the result of inspections made under the factory inspection law which forms one of the most essential features in the industrial life of the Nebraska workmen. The ravages of occupational diseases are far more dangerous, to the lives of the workmen, than are our industrial accidents, owing to the onslaught of industrial poisons which are taken up through the respiratory organs, inhalation, aggregation on the skin and mucous membrane, by way of the digestive tract and by means of contaminated foods and drink. As a result of the disclosures, derived from our inspections, and the realization of the importance of full and accurate knowledge con - cerning the existence of dangers from industrial poisons from the various industries we hereto append code of rules for the protection of the industrial workers against the dangers of poison. Such rules being prescribed as a means of aiding in the eradication of industrial disease. Among other things which would effectively remedy our occupa - tional diseases should be included an amendment to the law making it the duty of all physicians to make report upon all cases of industrial poisoning, as well as for the manufacturer and user of industrial poison, the gathering of statistics of sickness is especially dangerous occupa - tions, the insistent instruction and training in industrial hygiene, the supervision by technical experts of employments dangerous to health, and the regulation of the hours of labor for all workers coming in con - tact with poisonous substances. INDUSTRIAL POISONS FOUND IN NEBRASKA'S INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTIONS Acetaldehyde. Ethylaldehyde, CH3COH: A colorless, very volatile fluid, of the pungent odor. The industries in which this poison is found are the manufacturers of vinegar and silver mirrors, the poisons of which appear in the form of vapor, affecting the respiratory organs </seg>
            <seg id="p095">93 t Ammonia, HN3: A colorless gas of sharply penetrating odor. The Btries in which this poison is prevalent is iron plated with tin or zinc, bone black, gas manufacturing, varnishes, tanning, packing industry, beet sugar, manufacturing, manufacturing ice, refrigerator plants. The poisonous effects are observed in gasous form, through the organs of respiration. Seldom 'pure, mostly in combination with other gases. Having immediate effect on the conjunctiva and the cornea. A propor - tion of more than 0.15 per cent of ammonia in the air immediately causes an irritable condition of the mucous membrane. Chronic bronchial catarrhs are especially liable to follow lung continued inhalation of small quantities of the gas defused in the air. Cyanogen Compounds: Dicyanogen, C2N2; Prussic acid, HCN; Hydrocyanic acid, a colorless, highly volatile fluid, of penetrating, pun - gent, and irritating odor. Natrium cyanide (NaCN), Cyanide potassium, potassium cyanide (KCN): A colorless salt, forming crystal which, after fusion, recrystallize, but readily decompose on exposure to the air, setting free hydrocyanic acid. Rhodanic ( sulphocyanic, SCN) com - pounds: Poisonous dose of the dilute hydrocyanic acid, 0.06g. The poisonous effects of such poison and their combinations are found in the gold plating, electro plating; manufacturer of cyanogen compound and inorganic processes. The poisonous effects being taken into the human system through the respiratory organs; prussic acid also through the epidermis. The symptoms of such gasous poisons are noticable head - ache, rush of blood to the head, oppression of the chest, palpitation of the heart, a sensation of constriction at the throat with pharyngeal irri - tation and dryness, nausea and vomiting, difficult, gasping respiration, without retention of consciousness. Lead, Pb: A bluish white, highly lustrous metal, which on ex - posure to the air acquires a gray tarnish. Lead alloys. Lead colors; other lead compounds. Lead sulphurate (galena) is held to be non - poisonous, and some lead polysilicates are regarded as merely so. The industries in which these poisons are prevalent are smelting and lead bearing commodities, the manufacturing of articles made of metallic lead (sheets, plates, boxes, pipes, wire, cans, flasks, pails, faucets and retorts i. The mixing and compounding of lead colors, such as litharge, white lead, krems white, red lear, lead chromates, acetate of lead, lead color works, the trade of painter, the manufacture of varnishes; plants for installation of gas and water, the textile industry, etc. The poison - ous effects of lead and its tributaries are of the most dangerous and wide reaching influences. Such poisons being taken into the system through the absorption of lead and lead compound. In the form of vapor (very finely divided oxide of lead), and as dust, through the res - piratory organs; by way of the digestive tract by means of contam - inated food and drinks thus being taken into the stomach. Industrial lead poisoning appears as a rule in the chronic form and arises from continuous absorption of the most infinitesimal quan - tities of lead during a protracted period of time (weeks, months, and </seg>
            <seg id="p096">94 The beginning is insidious, with disturbances of the general health, a sense of weakness, decline of bodily strength; sallow, pale-yellowish hue of the skin. Distress in the region of the stomach, eructations, lack of appetite, metallic taste in the mouth and fetid breath. Paralysis generally affects the extensor muscles of the arms and hands, with atrophic manifestations; more rarely, the flexor muscles. Tar: A product obtained by dry distillation, particularly of anthra - cite coal and lignite. The poisonous effects of tar are found in the manufacture of illuminating gas; coke ovens; tar works; tar produce factories; the manufacture of roofing paper; used for concrete paving; painting of metals; as a fuel; briquet factories. Its poisonous effects act on the skin; in the form of vapor, on the respiratory organs. Tar itch under the form of diffuse acne, eczema or psoriasis, pri - marily on the upper exteremities, later, also, on the other parts of the body, etc. The general symptoms: loss of appetite, nausea, dirrahea, organic principles, their plan of organization as well as the reasons headache, numbness, vertigo, besides disturbances of the urinary bladder, also albuminuria and oedema. Nitrous Gases (low degrees of oxidation of nitrogen, which appear simultaneously) : Nitrogen protoxide, NO; nitrogen deutoxide, NO2; nitrogen troxide, 6203; anhydrous nitrous acid (HN02); red fuming nitric acid is a saturated solution of N2O4 in crude NH03; NO is a color - less gas which under the influence of atmospheric oxygen, is readily transformed into brown nitrogen oxide. Below â 20*C. N203 is a blue fluid; at the ordinary temperature it separates into NO and N02. Nitrous gases are formed by the action of nitric acid on deoxidating substances of the various kinds, principally on metals (iron, lead, zinc, etc.), on organic substances such as (coal dust, wood, straw, paper, textile fabrics, woollen refuses, etc.) as well as many other substances (printers, sulphurous acid and its salts, soda sediment, hydrochloric acid, iron chlorides, sulphate of iron, etc.). The industries found to be affected by this poison were printing offices, gas works, department stores and such institutions having poor ventilating facilities. Such gases attack the human body through the respiratory organs, the poisonous effect being slow in its progress but nevertheless effective through the causing of a general debilitated con - dition of the entire system. Persons who suffer from the diseases of the respiratory organs are especially susceptible; not infrequently the continual inhalation of small quantities, for many consecutive yean even, occasions no serious disturbances of the health. The symptoms of nitrous gas poisoning will be shown in the bluish discoloration of the countenance, coldness of the extremities, a pale, â¢allow complexion and chronic bronchial catarrh may be deemed, never - theless, the usual consequences of occupational inhalation of very mod- </seg>
            <seg id="p097">95 TABLES SHOWING THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH POISONS WERE The above table shows simply the number of wage earners who come directly in contact with the poisons of those occupational pro - visions and who lost time as the result therefrom. The lack of any provision of the law requiring a record or report thereon leaving the department handicapped in collecting such information. It should be borne in mind that the greatest damage resulting from occupational poisoning developes slowly and in after life even in the next generation. â Those having reported in other class Kind of Industry Number of Industries Number Penonf AfTeet ad Number Affected Causing Lou of Time 1 aeataMahyde Vinegar Factorial PoUoru Mirror Faetoriei 4 1 11 t Â« Ammonia Pofcon.

            <seg id="p229">227 FARM LIFE The fascination of farm life is daily attracting the attention of thousands of people who are asking, "Shall I go to the farm?" tit is not for the state or any of its departments to say whether or ; any person shall go to the farm, but it is the duty of the Bureau Labor and Industrial Statistics of Nebraska to clearly and truthfully w what resources of the state are as a means of enabling those who y be interested in determining this question for themselves. FOUNDATION Â»The farm is the basis of our material life and prosperity : the farmer the dominant factor in our common weal of regardless of his con - ausness or un-consciousness. He is the producer of the necessaries well as the luxuries of life, both for himself and those in the city. ATTRACTIVENESS The fascination and independence of farm life, stimulated by na - ture's grandeur, the glories of the sunshine, gentle breezes and the harmonizing influences of out of door life are but a few of the attrac - tions of the farm. 'Tis the reverse from the congestion and discomfort of the people in the city, to the squalid, damp and dingy quarters in our industrial centers. STABILITY I The safety and surety in farming, today, is due largely to the fact t farming, as it is now conducted, is a new vocation. It is scientific iculture, if you please; your chemist tests the soil, subjects it to a mical analysis and tells you what crop it is best adapted to, the kind fertilizer to use and how to rotate your crops. All the modern con - iences, such as telephones, rural mails, automobiles, good roads and many other up-to-date equipments have become component parts of farm life of today. SOCIAL CONDITIONS tBack in the old days, when a majority of our people were located le farms, when the vocation of the farmer seemed so remote from leighbor, due to distance, and when great opportunities were offered le cities for our young men and women, it is no wonder that they ed away from the farm. Neither can we blame the system, as it the outgrowth of the times. Conditions have reversed themselves, we find the cities over-crowded, vocations filled: while on the other hand, we learn that the farms have </seg>
            <seg id="p230">BIENNIAL REPORT 228 suffered through the lack of a population sufficient to properly till the soil, while the social environments have developed as the rapid methods of transportation have brought the people closer in touch with each other and the system of bonanza farming have been outlived, science, sense and energy having triumphed. EDUCATION Farming, like other vocations, depends largely upon the intelligence and scientific applications of energy properly applied to the soil, backed by nature's influences. It is not particularly necessary, however, that one shall possess a college education or shall have taken a course in agriculture or have served an apprenticeship on the farm but rather that you are willing to adhere to the general scientific methods and work up to the instructions of our agricultural experts. In fact it is being proven that the most successful farmers of today are men who knew nothing of farming, who realized that they knew nothing, but who were willing to learn and were, therefore, most willing to accept the advice of experts. Men who were not in the old rut of farming the maximum acreage instead of developing the maximum production. SIZE OF THE FARMS The business of farming so far as it applies to its magnitude will compare favorably with commercial enterprises. The number of acres which you propose to till should be governed by, first, your ability to hustle; second, your knowledge of the soil and its condition; third, the kind of crops which you propose to raise. The small farm, well tilled, properly rotated and scientifically handled is, without doubt, the best and safest investment so far as farm production is concerned. Do not confuse the idea of "how to make a living on ten acres" with that of "how to get rich on one acre," but the general principle of fair sized farm well tilled is the logical rule in farming as well as other business undertakings. VALUES fThe prices of land are, as a rule, governed by location rather than its productivity. Markets, transportation facilities and condensed settlements, which add greatly to the social conditions, largely govern land values of the farm. The kind of crops to be grown, or rather which can be grown, decide, in a measure, the valuation of lands in each particular section. This does not argue, however, that the land adjacent to the larger towns are more valuable for crop production but that markets and prices are better and that your chances for the association with your fellow men are greater. </seg>
            <seg id="p231">BUREAU OF LABOR 229 OWNERSHIP One of our government bulletins in dealing with the question of the ability of laborers and tenants to become home owners, says "that 72 per cent of the laborers and tenants find it reasonably possible to acquire farm ownership." This is made possible through the help of a mortgage. In this manner the opportunity of saving enough out of the farm production to care for the family and to meet the payments upon the home purchase. LOCATION The question of location is the one great problem when one haa decided to "go to the farm." The governing features in the selection of the location should be: the soil, climate, temperature, rainfall, schools, crops which can be raised, social surroundings, transportation facilities, land values and the general harmony of all those essentials. L Nebraska presents to the world the following facts descriptive of general resources and opportunities which are here told in brief: </seg>
            <seg id="p232">230 NEBRASKA L Nebraska lies near the jreopraphieal center of the nation and in the t of America's most fertile agricultural district, having an area of 77,794 square miles with 712 .square miles of water surface or 49,148,160 acres of land, of which approximately 24,215,550 are under cultivation, supporting a population of 1.192,214 people. SOIL LThe soil of Nebraska is known to be the most fertile in the world, g composed of what is known as the vegetable mould and alluvial substances and loess materials garnished with a sandy loam which con - tains a porous texture admitting of the absorbing and storing of the copous rainfall, peculiar to the climate of this state, which is drawn K during the dryer seasons, thus destroying the possibilities of crop res. ALTITUDE I Nebraska ranges in altitude from 5,300 feet in the western part 850 in the eastern, sloping gradually to the east at an average of feet to the mile. Twenty-five per cent of the state's surface being composed of valleys, there being over four hundred streams connected with and tributary to the Republican River alone. The river valleys vary in breadth from twenty to a quarter of a mile, affording unlimited water power facilities which beckon to those seeking manufacturing opportunities where unlimited power, labor and raw materials are at hand. CLIMATE The climate of Nebraska is exhilirating, salubrious and invigorat - ing due to the natural drainage, gentle winds and almost continuous sunshine, rendering the atmosphere dry, cool and refreshing at all times. To those seeking both health and wealth, Nebraska offers great oppor - tunities. TEMPERATURE The mean annual temperature of the northern portion of the state is 50% * while the southern portion shows 52Â°. The average range of tite thermometer is from 18 : below in January and February to 100* above during the hot season. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">231 RAINFALL I The average rainfall varies in the different sections of the state, the Missouri River on the east, the average is thirty-five inches per r, while in the western portion the average is about fifteen inches. SCHOOLS E?braska is noted for her high educational standard and her public system. Free instructions and free school books being provided the common schools of the state for persons between the ages of d twenty one years. RAILROADS Nebraska has a perfect net work of railroads, which affords excellent transportation facilities. This, together with the natural wagon ways of Nebraska, afford unlimited opportunities for marketing products at all seasons of the year. CROPS E Nebraska's principal crops are corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye, alfalfa, potatoes, sugar beets, apples, sorghum cane, kaffir corn, spelts, i corn and garden vegetables of all kinds in great abundance. FRUIT GROWING It is conceded that eastern Nebraska has soil and climate better suited to commercial orcharding than any other part of the United States. The fruit is comparatively free from troublesome insect pests, and is of the finest quality, color, and its yield enormous. The cultiva - tion of small fruit and berries are, just now, receiving attention and are destined to become one of the great factors in fruit culture of this STOCK RAISING PThe western section of Nebraska stands pre-eminently at the head the list of stock raising states and grazing districts. Here cattle cannot only be grazed for breeding purposes but fattened for the market upon the natural range of Nebraska grasses. Nebraska is doubly blessed in the stock raising industry because of its grand grazing opportunities and the fact that its corn sections fur - nish the corn with which, if necessary, to finish its range stock for the market where Nebraska's dressed beef stands at the head of the list in the world's market. Nebraska produces sheep, horses, hogs and cattle in great abundance and of the finest breeds. DAIRYING With a soil and climate particularly adapted to the successful grow - ing of all important forage plants, corn and root crops, with its un - limited wealth of nutritious grasses, an abundance of the best water has </seg>
            <seg id="p234">BIENNIAL REPORT 232 placed Nebraska foremost in dairy production. Omaha, the metropolis of Nebraska, boasts as being the greatest butter market in the world and now stands first as the greatest milk and cream depot, receiving in one month in 1910 an average of 748,000 gallons. POULTRY The little red hen adds to Nebraska resources in wealth, yearly, approximately $43,000,000 aside from her utility as an insect extermi - nator. Poultry raising may be termed as a bi-product of Nebraska farming, being as it were, the natural home of the wild prairie chicken and is equally adapted as a forage ground for the unlimited thousands of domestic fowls, such facts serving to furnish an idea of the possi - bilities of poultry raising in Nebraska. LANDS There is approximately 23,000,000 acres of unfilled land which is used for grazing purposes or else lies idle, the bulk of which is subject to cultivation and is for sale. This land is deeded land and ranges in price from $5.00 to $100.00 per acre and is found in all parts of the state. Nebraska has approximately 150,000 acres of land under irrigation in what is known as the western district, located on the western border of the state. t There is much land in other western sections which it is possible bring under irrigation, the only requisite being a greater settlement of wide-awake, progressive, hustling citizens. Such possibilities being confined, principally, to the dryer and sparsely settled districts of the western part where land values are the cheapest in the entire state. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">The following statistics show in detail the record of the farm acreage of crops, orchard, live stock, values and production together with each county's record for the year 1911, all of which is the evidence of the authenticity of the preceding statements made with reference to the State's resources. </seg>
