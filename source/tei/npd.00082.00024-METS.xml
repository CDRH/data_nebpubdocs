            <seg id="p002">S JMMARY Nineteen samples of margarine wee obtained from Illinois, Ohio, and Nebraska. They were analyzed chemically and thu vitamin A content of each one was compared with that of either sour-cream or swe :t-cream butter. The fat content of the butter samples varied from 80.2 to 81.5 per cent, while the fat content of the margarine samples varied from 78.3 to 89.2 per cent. From the results it was evident that these samples of margarine were very poor .sources of vitamin A when compared with butter. One of the margarine samples caused an average gain of 10 grams per rat and another caused an average gain of 25 grams per rat when fed at the rate of 1 cc. daily for eight weeks. In every other case the rats fed margarine showed a final 1 &gt;ss in weight and most of them did not survive the experiment. Butter was fed at a daily rate equal to one-tenth or one-twentieth of the quantity of margarine fed in all cases but one, and the rats survived and gained, the smallest gain averaging 45 grams and the large it 111 grams during the eight-weeks period. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">The Vitamin A Content of Sour Cream Butter, Sweet Cream Butter, and Margarines I. L. HATHAWAY AND H. P. DAVIS With each major increase m the price of butter we generally find an increased consumption of butter substitutes and a renewed interest m the nutritive value of these products. Many investigators are agreed (9) that the energy value and digestibility of margarines are equal to those of butter. There is still a difference of opinion, however, regarding the vitamin con - tent of the two products. According to personal correspondence with the Institute of Margarine Manufacturers, there were forty-seven factories which were manufacturing margarines m the United States m January, 1934, and those factories were making between 1,000 and 2,000 brands of margarine. Because only a few brands have been studied and because the Nebraska Experiment Station had received numerous inquiries regarding the food value of margarine and butter, it was thought advisable to investi - gate the vitamin A content of a number of these products. REVIEW OF LITERATURE Several investigators (2, 3, 10) have reported on one sample of nut - margarine and found that the sample examined was low m vitamin A con - tent. Hawk (5) on the other hand reported that one brand contained as much vitamin A as butter. Fetter and Carlson (2) reported that an animal - fat margarine churned m milk was equal to butter m vitamin A content. Poe and Fehlman (7) examined eight samples of nut-margarines, colored by the addition cf palm oil, and concluded that the palm oil showed promise as a source of growth-promoting substances m nut-margarines. In another study Poe and Fehlman (8) compared the vitamin A content of uncolored nut-margarines with that of butter and concluded that nut - margarines, when compared with butter, seemed to be an extremely poor source of vitamin A. Coward (1) reported that some English manufac - turers have added vitamin concentrates to their margarines. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES The management of the rat colony and the procedure for the determina - tion of vitamin A were essentially the same as those outlined m a previous study (4), except where otherwise indicated. The breeding stock was maintained on the Steenbock Stock Ration, composed as follows: Stock Ration 1 Yellow corn 76.0% Ground alfalfa ■...." 2.0% Linseed oil meal 16.0% Sodium chloride .' &#132; . 0.5% Crude casein 5.0% Calcium carbonate 0.5% The materials were finely ground and then 5 per cent by weight of butter was added. In addition to this ration, the rats received fresh whole milk daily and head-lettuce several times each week. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Agr. Exp. &gt;ta. Research Bulletin 79 Since vitamin A is a growth -promoting vitamin, the vitamin-A de - terminations were made by comparing the growth produced when groups of rats, whose body stores of vitamin A had been depleted by being fed a \itaniin-A-free ration, were fed tie butters or margarines as a source of i this vitamin. Pied rats reared in our laboratory were used in all of the experiments. Male and female rits, 22 to 25 days old and weighing be - tween 35 and 45 grams, were fed a vitamin-A-free basal ration until de - pleted. In Experiment I Basal Ration 1 was used, while Basal Ration 2 was used in Experiments Had III. These rations were composed as follows: Ba: al Ration 1 Casein * li % Starch :l 63% Salt mixture -. % YcasH 15% Ba al Ration 2 Casein 1!% Yeast 15% Salt mixture 4% Hydrojjenatcd vegetable oil •' 10% . Starch 5.1% The antirachitic factor was su jplied by irradiation of the starch and the yeast with a Cooper-Hewitt quirtz mercury vapor lamp" run at 2.4 amperes, 250 volts. One hundred grams of starch or yeast was spread uni - formly over an area 60 centimeter; square in metal trays and then irradiated for 40 minutes at a distance of 60 centimeters. All experimental animals received distilled water to which iodine was added once each week in the manner suggested by Sure (11). The rats were weighed once each week except near the end of the depletion period, at which time they were weighed daily. The litters were allotted so that as far as possible related animals were distributed throughput all the groups. Each rat was placed in an individual cage at weaning a id was housed alone until the experiment was completed. A negative cor trol receiving only the basal ration was selected from each litter except where several litters were started on the butter or margarine supplement at approximately the same time. The i feeding of the butter or margari ic was begun when ophthalmia was in its incipient stage, or when there was a cessation of growth. As a rule the pre-expcrimental or depletion period lasted for about five weeks, while the feeding trial was carried on eig it weeks. The butter and margarine simples were stored in an electrical refrig - erator at 4° C. Small samples were taken daily and melted at 55° C. The quantity allowed each rat 'vas then measured with a pipette and fed • ' A special grade °f purified casein (No. -f53) was purchased from the Casein Company of America, New York City.

Samples 3, 4, and 5 were purchased locally and contained animal as well as vegetable oils. Samples 6 and 7 were the same brand as Sample 5 but were obtained from Chicago, Illinois, and Columbus, Ohio, respectively, and contained only vegetable oils. The butters were fed at 0.05 cc. and 0.1 cc. levels, while the margarines were fed at 0.5 cc. and 1.0 cc. levels. Seven to nine rats were allotted to each level. The groups of rats receiving 0.05 cc. and 0.1 cc. of sour-cream butter (Sample 1) made an average gain per rat of 46 and 66 grams respectively, while the groups fed corresponding levels of sweet-cream butter (Sample 2) made an average gain of 45 and 67 grams respectively.

None of the rats fed Samples 20 or 21 survived the experiment, and only one receiving Sample 19 survived. Two rats each from the groups fed Samples 16 and 17 and three and four rats respectively from the groups fed Samples 15 and 18 survived. The group receiving Sample 23 made an average gain ot 10 grams per rat, while the group fed Sample 22 made an average gain of 25 grams per rat. The group receiving the butter made an average gain of 111 grams per rat. As in the previous experiments, the margarines were poor sources of vitamin A. It should be noted that all of the margarines except Sample 13 were fed in quantities ten times as great as were the butters, yet only two of the 19 samples studied contained enough vitamin A to maintain any growth in the rats. From the results of t lese three experiments in which 370 rats were used, 281 of which were fel margarines, it was clearly evident that these margarines were very poorjources of vitamin A.
