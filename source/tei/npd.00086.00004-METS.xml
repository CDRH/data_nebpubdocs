The,, d.seourse has generally been at some length, while this will be the opposite—short. N_,«_ PaSt (V ,SeVC" a! yea,° have b &lt;*n disastrous to agriculture in | Nebraska, wth an extensive drouth covering the state, together with he pests, grasshoppers, causing the crops to be short, and of course reducng our hvestock population on farms to the smallest one known in h.story. I cou ,dn', help but notice in driving by these farms while raveling about the state the absence of livestock; i fac we pat d vera farms where they had advertisements up stating it was a ! stock farm and ,n a great many cases we did not see a single head of ' stock on that farm. Farms that were once productive and had good * improvements well supplied with Hvestock, now appear to be in a v y poor state of repair, and with scarcely any live tock on them and this coupled with high taxes, and low prices for the products of the farm, have « a great many cases produced very disastrous results to the owners. In a conversation with some of the livestock growers in j : </seg>
         <seg id="p009">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the western part of the state that I met at Denver I had been in - formed tpat on a great many of the ranches and on the improved live - stock failms that the stock was deteriorating, and in conversation with those that farmed they report that owing to the high prices of feed that they were unable to keep up the standing of their livestock by purchasing the proper sires., In conversation with Mr. Shellenberger, who we. know is one of our important producers of livestock, he con - firmed this report. This is a sad situation, and can only be righted, I think, in time if our state again becomes in a productive state; if we have the rain we can produce the feed, and I believe the livestock on our farm 5 will again take its place. Nebraska, as we all know, depends entirely on agriculture. When agriculture'is at low ebb naturally our county and state fairs feel the effects; however, notwithstanding that a great number of our County Fairs and our State Fair have continued to show gains, and have been able to withstand the storm. In 1937 the.State Fair was able to make some advances with its budget, and keep its finances in the black ink on the right side of the ledger. Owing to the large number of buildings naturally the upkeep is no sm ill item. In the year 1937 we received considerable help in the way of labor from PWA, but even with this help we were com - pelled to spend a large sum of our earnings to purchase materials for this work. A great many of you of course understand that the PWA will give you their services, but the material we' had to buy. In the way of repairs that we have done on our roofs out there we were at a great expense. {We also found that on the Fair Grounds we had to lay some new water mains, this material had to be bought. While they furnished the labor, the material still took a large sum from our earnings. The legislature appropriated some $10,000.00 for maintenance and operating expenses, but this was a small amount compared with what is needed, gentlemen, when you come to keep up an institution like Nebraska State Fair with an investment of a million and a half dollars in build - ings and improvements, with 23 acres of roofs to take care of; you cannot do that—or we cannot, under the present conditions without aid from the state. The amount that was appropriated was not sufficient for us to make the necessary repairs. We have buildings on this ground now that are in need of repair very badly, and unless they get these repairs soon they are bound to deteriorate. During the past year approximately $16,000.00 was paid, in in - terest, to the holders of independent bonds on the grandstand; but the elimination of this debt is slow, and under the present conditions it will take some time, or possibly not in some of our times -will we be able to lift this debt under the present conditions. We made a request of the legislature direct, upon a recommendation by the Gov - ernor, to be allowed to refund these bonds from a 5%% to probably a </seg>
         <seg id="p010">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 3h! bf Si!' T uat reqU6St Was refused by our legislature. If we had been able to do that, this year we could have retired at least $8,000.00 of these bonds; there is quite a difference between 3% and 5%% on a debt of this size. Now, at this time a matter comes to my mind that 1 want to talk just a moment on. We had a very nice talk this morning from the sec - retary of the M.ssouri State Fair. It was a fine talk, and we have had a great many requests by peop]e wondering why we could not reduce the fee on the gate to twenty-five cents. There are several reasons why hat cannot be done, gentlemen. In the first place we are loaded with these independent bonds. We have to take money from some other source than from this grandstand to buy this entertainment that is put on , n front of this grandstand, the bondholders get every dime that is taken in on the grandstand. Now. in the case of Missouri, they get that twenty-five cents on the gate, and they also get the fifty cent's on the grandstand, which we do not. If we could have the proceeds from the grandstand instead of turning it over to the bondholders we could gadly put on a twenty-five cent gate. Even with a fifty cent gate I do not know where you could go to see as much as you can for the money at the Nebraska State Fair. An individual pays fifty cents at the gate when you go in; he , an Bee ,„ the Qf fair and have access to all parts of the grounds with the entertainment in the afternoon, and come back in the evening, and he's only spent a dollar. It seems to me that that is just about as cheap entertainment as you could get anywhere. I was out to the Livestock Show at Denver last week-or week before; . very nice show and a very nice entertainment if you wanted &lt;• -stay for the entertainment. They charged fifty cents to get in, and the main thing that you saw was the judging of the stock for that fifty cents. If we were putting on a show like- that in Nebraska where you see stock judging ami practically nothing else, you would be disgusted with it but they had a good show and it was worth the money." So I think that the public is really getting just btnefit for the money they I invest in the State Fair. Agricultural activities coming under the direction of the Board should have a larger appropriation. You, of course, or most of you, i understand that the legislature appropriates a certain sum for agri- « cultural activities. Fifteen thousand dollars, that is quite a reduction i from what we have had in the past. That $16,000.00 is turned over to US I to administer for the benefit of the different agricultural societies in I Nebraska; we get no benefit from that other than we just administer it I for them. In the past agriculture has not received the recognition and I assistance ,t is entitled to. I want to say to you gentlemen that in t_ fourteen years that I put in in the Nebraska Senate when I got down to the Agriculture Department I found out we had never learned any - ¦\ I </seg>
         <seg id="p011">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture thing about what that department is doing; well, it is. practically not doing much of anything for the aid of agriculture. The legislature of Nebraska have appropriated very little money for agriculture, and it is time that Nebraska woke up and made some appropriations for their main industry, which is agriculture, and we hope in the future that the legislature will see this in that light and that more appropri - ations cs n be made direct for the aid of. agriculture. (Applause.) We appropriate millions for highways and other activities, but agriculture receives small recognition outside of that made by the uni - versity md by the agricultural college. When agriculture receives the recognition due it, then, and then only, will our state show advance - ment anl prosperity. The secretary, in his report, will give you more of the finances than I will because he has those and will tell you about them. I want to thank the members of the County Fairs for their fine cooperation given to the State Fair; they are the life and backbone of the State Fair, which we will admit. We wish to assure you members present that we are always glad for your help and advice, and we do need your help and advice, because there is a question, and one of the great questions that comes before the Nebraska State Fair Board as to what kind of entertainment and what we can put on that is going to take with- the public. You will remember that in selecting entertain - ment to be put on in front of this grandstand we have to please a great many people of different types, and that is one of the perplexing questions^ that come before us, and if you gentlemen that have had experience in your County Fairs can give us any assistance we would sure appreciate it. It has been said in the past, and truly so, that the State Fair is the show] window of the state. I am hoping that conditions will change in Nebraska, and that our fair state will again blossom with productive crops, and that in the year 1938 we may be able to present to you Nebraska people one of the finest shows in the history of the state. Again I thank you for your cooperation, arid ask your continued support and cooperation in 1938. . MR. | SHUBERT: Members of the State Board of Agriculture and County Fair men: I am mighty glad President Banning stressed at least two points that have been near to my heart for a good while. The first; of them is cooperation of the County Fair men with the State Board of Agriculture. Ever since I have been on this State Board I have wondered why it was that there.wasn't a little bit closer con - nection between the two. It seems to me that up until this session we have jbeen rather separated, and I am glad indeed to know that it was said in your meeting down there yesterday afternoon that there should be complete cooperation between the County Fairs and State </seg>

         <seg id="p014">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRESIDENT BANNING: We will now have the Secretary's report. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY In compliance with the statutes I am presenting the annual report of the achievements and financial statement of the State Board of Agriculture for the year 1937. Weather conditions were quite favor - able in most parts of the state up to the latter part of July and looked like a very favorable year for Fairs. However, a few days of intense heat changed the picture and caused much anxiety to fair officials, for by the first of September the coin crop was a total loss in many parts of the state. With the previous drouths and effects of the de - pression, many of the state's population were in a precarious condition financially and did not have the money to attend the State Fair. Then, too. the infantile paralysis epidemic coming on shortly before the open - ing of the Fair kept many from attending- this year. With the condi - tions we were forced to meet we feel that we made a very creditable showing. We are passing through a period of changed conditions. With the machine age in agriculture, with tractors and combines and all the other modern machinery, the radio with the programs and news - towers where people can sit in their own homes and hear the best talent the world has to offer, the Fair officials have a perplexing time to figure out attractions that will satisfy the public and at the same time bring sufficient revenue- to pay premiums and expenses of the Fair. They cannot always put on attractions that they individually believe to be the best entertainment for the o'.d and the young, but must cater to the demands of the patrons of the Fair which are com - posed of many different classes of people. I wish at this time to re - iterate that our State Fair is the show window for Nebraska's products and is one of the valuable educational institutions of the state. Many people fail to realize this, thinking of the Fair as only a place to go for recreation, but with our exhibits of all classes of live stock, dis - plays of agricultural products from all parts of the state, domestic - products, the art department, the educational exhibit, the mammoth display of machinery and modern conveniences, with the boys and girls ¦1-H club work, the Fair offers an opportunity for education to all classes of people. Not only is the fair valuable as an exhibition, but also affords an opportunity for annual reunions—to brush elbows with old friends from other parts of the state—to clasp the hand of friend - ship, of old friends denied for a season, to share their joys and sor - rows, is an effective education for the human mind, and provides a season of contentment, happiness and future retrospection which fully repays all the denials and expenses incident to the trip. </seg>
         <seg id="p015">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ¦...'. Livestock The livestock show is one of the great attractions at the State Fair. Harold Depue, Secretary of, the North Montana State Fair on the program of the recent International Fair Association meeting in Chicago,! his subject being the "Cattle Show and the Fair," stated they would have the National Hereford Show in 1938 for the fourth year as it had proved a magnet for the two classes who are so important at the turnstiles, those who come to see the live stock and those that use the live stock as an excuse to come. Many of the live stock classes at the Nebraska State Fair were effected by the drouth and high price of feed and lack of demand for breeding animals. The draft horse classes brought together some fine horses, especial - ly in the Belgian classes. We cannot expect to have the numbers we have had in the past as there are few breeders in the state. In the Belgian k-lasses there were 13 exhibitors with 67 entries and 48 head exhibited In the Percherons there were only 2 exhibitors with 16 entries and 9 head shown, a comparison with 1909 when there were 414 head shown and all but 03 owned in Nebraska. In 1928 there were 788,000 horses entered on the tax rolls/in 1937 there were 599,000 and with the large number lost the past season with the sleeping sickness, makes a large reduction in that number. In 1928 there were 28,000 tractors listed. In the spring of 1937 there were 56,000 with an estimate of :j,OOO more sold since that time which goes to show what a change the ihachine age is making in th.7farming industry in this state. In the fancy horse show there were 20 exhibitors with 165 entries, 70 head exhibited. The show was probably the best ever held here in numbei) and quality of those exhibited, but the attendance was not what it should be for a show of that class and not very encouraging for the management to continue the show. Pony Show ¦ :'..¦¦ ¦ ¦;. '.-• : ,¦¦ ;'.-,.. ¦'...., ¦ ¦ ' ¦ . In the pony classes there were sixty-one entries with twenty-seven ponies shown. Beef and Dairy Cattle In the beef cattle classes there were 18 exhibitors with 159 head exhibited; 25 of which were Shorthorns, 36 Herefords, 40 Aberdeen Angus! 34 Polled Shorthorns and 24 Red Polled. In the Shorthorn and Hereford classes the University of Nebraska was the only Nebraska exhibitor., There were four Nebraska exhibitors in the Angus class, three in the Polled Shorthorn and one in the Red Polled. In the dairy cattle classes there were 54 exhibitors with 235 head shown! of which 67 were Jerseys, 62 Guernseys, 22 Ayrshire., 8 Brown Swiss and 76 Holsteins. </seg>
         <seg id="p016">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Swine Department In the Swine Department there were 45 exhibitors with 420 head shown of which 107 were Duroc Jerseys, 74 Poland Chinas, 57 Spotted Poland Chinas, 127 Hampshires and 55 Chester White. The number compares very well with past years when the number of hogs in Nebraska this year totaled 1,507,000 compared with 5,340,000 in 1928. Sheep Department The Sheep Show was made up entirely of Nebraska exhibitors, only six in number, with 129 head shown. Poultry Department There were 119 exhibitors in the Poultry Show exhibiting 797 birds. This was a very good showing considering the high price of feed. Pigeon Department In the Pig.'on Department there were 41 exhibitors with a total of 447 entries. The show this year was practically a Nebraska exhibit, only two state;— Kansas and Missouri—renresented in the display. 4-H Club Work The 4-H Club boys and girls had a wonderful exhibit in the 4-H Club Building. There wevv 210 baby beef steers exhibited and 46 baby beef heifers. In the dairy cattle division of the club work there were 59 entries. The swine division with 170 entries. There were 24 entries in the colt division. Sheep division with 04 entries. Poultry 82 entries. The team demonstrations totaled 202 entries and the judging contests 133 entries. Total number of entries for the entire club division— 2,644. We have some figures here which I think will be interesting to you and which has been giving considerable concern to those interested in the 4-H Club show. At the Nebraska State Fair this year there were 195 head of beeves that sold at an average of §15.79 per hundred. Some of the heifers were bid in at $13.50 and then shipped to Omaha bringing $15.75 and $10.00. The show immediately following at Sioux City, there were 279 head that averaged §18.11. Then came St. Joseph with 261 head averaging $10.37 per hundred. At Ak-Sar-Ben there were 341 head that averaged $18.60 per hundred; 311 steers averaged $19.02 and the 30 heifers averaged $14.25. The grand champion at Nebraska State Fair brought 53 cents, at Sioux City 66 cents, St. Joseph 50 cents and Ak-Sar-Ben $1.60. The variance of price is going to have its effect on future shows. It is a matter that needs careful </seg>

S . ¦'.'¦¦ Domestic Products The Domestic Products exhibit was housed in the Lincoln Building this year instead of the ba'cony of Agricultural Hall. There were 1,731 entries which made a fine display. Bees and Honey Department While conditions prior to; the Fair were very unfavorable for the Bees and Honey exhibit, yet thirty-eight entries were made for the Pair making a creditable show. '.'... Needle Work Department In the Needle Work classes there were 1,486 entries which made a very interesting exhibit. The! number of prize winners in the depart - ment totaled 198.

Educational Department The 3,834 entries in the Educational Department was an increase of nearly 500 entries over last year. Twenty-seven county superin - tendents] made entries, 12 town and city schools were represented, in addition!to the individual entries made in the department. </seg>
         <seg id="p020">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Spelling Contest Only sixteen contestants participated in the Spelling Contest at the Fair this year. A written and oral division for this department enables contestants to enter either division or both, as they desire. The contest is held but the one day, Tuesday, and it is hoped that the interest will revive next year for a good entry list. Rural School Chorus The group participating in this department of the Fair was smaller this year, as were all children's activities, due to the infantile paralysis epidemic. This program on Tuesday of the Fair is broadcast over a local radio station. The director reported that the songs were never sung better than this year. Baby Health Contest This was one of the departments badly effected by the epidemic of infantile- paralysis. The entries that had been made from Omaha were cancelled by order of the health officials of that city. Prior to the epidemic many applications for entries were refused in this department due to a limit of facilities to make the examinations. State Institutions Additional exhibit space in the Grandstand was necessary to pro - vide the various state institutions with sufficient room to make their display. This educational exhibit provides the patrons of the Fair with an opportunity to see in a short while what is being accomplished by these various state institutions. Machinery Exhibit The machinery exhibit was the finest ever put on at the Fair. Many of the companies decorating their display in the latest fashions with the very latest in modern inventions. With the radios and loud speakers made their booths very attractive for the patrons of the Fair. Manufacturer's Building The Manufacturer's Building was well filled again this year with a variety of concessions showing the improvements and new inventions for the home and business world. Automobile Building Three automobile dealers were represented at the Fair this year. Also housed in this building was a new and interesting exhibit made </seg>

Horseshoe Pitching This contest is enjoyed by the patrons of the Fair as well as the contestants. The prize winners this year represented nine counties of the state. '•;;'. Cat and Dog Show While the receipts for this department were less than last year, no doubt the cause can be attributed to the fact that there were fewer children !on the grounds due to the epidemic. . .¦'.¦"!'¦¦ '' ¦¦•'.' ¦¦':¦' :' Bird Show \ Only two exhibitors in this department of the Fair, but with 32 entries made an attractive display. Children's Day In spite of the infantile paralysis epidemic Children's Day brought many youngsters with the hope of winning the pony or bicycle donated by the Fair Board, or one of the many prizes offered by the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce for this occasion. : 7 7 Midway The Fairs in the Middle West Fair Circuit contracted with the Beckmann-Gerety Shows for the 1937 Fair season. The latest riding devices and shows were offered.the Nebraska State Fair patrons by this Company. ¦ Bands '".-'¦' Ten bands were engaged for the 1937 State Fair. Ainsworth, Brainard, Geneva, Lincoln, Louisville, Malmo, Omaha, Pleasant Dale, Syracuse and Wilber bands were represented. The plan of permitting bands to come in for one day of the Fair has made it possible for many out-in-the-state bands to take advantage of seeing the Fair and pleasing the patrons of the Fair with their music. Beauty Pageant j ''.-'¦' Winners of approximately one hundred local beauty pageants in Nebraska were in attendance on Sunday of the Fair to compete for the title of "Miss Nebraska 1937." Miss Ems Jo Newby of Humboldt </seg>
         <seg id="p022">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture was selected by the judges to represent Nebraska in 1938 at the Na - tional Pageant to be held at Atlantic City. Attractions The rodeo was the chief attraction in front of the grandstand at night and probably was responsible for the increase in the grandstand attendance. The Veteran's Program and Auto Races on Sunday' brought one of the largest crowds of the week. The running races with the free acts were well patronized, many people enthused with the sport, attended every day. The races furnish an attraction in front of the grandstand and at the same time the revenue from the mutuels more than pay the expenses of putting them on. Improvements Hi /miring ol roof* on the various buildings on the Fair Grounds was perhaps the most needed improvement made the past year. 468 squares of roofing have been laid on the Agricultural Hall at an ap - proximate cost of ').20 per square or $ 1,4.97.60. About 14 squares of skylight which wen- torn out by wind were replaced and the rest of skylights and copings being repaired at a cost of about $1,200.00.

A 6-inch booster pump and meter were taken up east of Agricultural Hall. The meter was installed in the new main connection at 14th street. A 25 horsepower three-phase motor, pump and valves were salvaged. Leveling and improving condition of grounds About 10 acres of ground were leveled north of the speed barns, amounting to the moving of approximately 35,000 yards of dirt. Ap - proximately 4 acres of ground adjoining the southwest corner of the Disposal Plant property has been leveled and the fence raised to present level, involving the moving of about 11,000 yards of dirt. The ground south and west of the Cattle Barn has been finished to better drainage. A drainage ditch about 800 feet long, averaging from 2% to 9 feet in depth was dug. Trees killed by drouth and by borers have been removed. Storm Sewer— 24o feet of 24-inch, 120 feet of 30-inch and 50 feet of 18-inch concrete storm sewer has been laid north and east of the Old 4-K Club Building. 7 ! , Electrical Department— Electric light and power lines have been built in the Machinery Field and Parking Field. 43,000 feet of light line for parking field and 23,000 feet of 220 three-phase power line for the machinery field.

Electric wiring around top of Cattle Barn has been replaced at a cost of $145.00. New Buildings—Remodeling of (Old Buildings A new concession built southwest of the New 4-H Club Building - size 20x26 at a cost of $220.00. The former Delco Light Building was remodeled for the John Deere Company at a cost of $170.00. Fire Department headquarters rebuilt to make office for Superintendent of Machinery at a cost of $140.00. Sixty stalls) were built in the north end of the Cattle Barn at a cost of $660.00. j¦ .; Concession Department— Perhaps the mostnoticeable improve - ment was the painting of the various concession booths on the grounds. The large dining hall building and roof was repaired and painted inside at a cost .of $430.00. Concession buildings around the Carnival Ground were repaired, mopped with asphalt and painted at a cost of $750.00. All small concession buildings and dining halls have been painted, and repaired at a cost of $550.00 Exhibit Building Improvemctits—ln the Agricultural Hall a jani - tor's room was built.

         <seg id="p024">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ment was moved from the northwest corner of the Agricultural Hall balcony to the Lincoln Building and the Bees and Honey Department given this location. Rearranging cost approximately $400.00. The legislature made an appropriation of $2,500 to purchase ma - terial for the extension of the water works sy_t.m and $2,500 for material on roofs. The WPA furnished a large part of the labor on the grading and other projects. Aside from the labor furnished by the WPA we spent $12,116.70 from our own funds. You will also note from the financial report that we spent $34,940.13 for maintenance and we received only $10,000 from the state for that purpose which left _4,940.13 to be paid from other receipts. With the improvements and repairs put on the buildings and grounds during the past year we are safe in saying that the buildings and grounds are in the l.est condition that they have ever been in 'luring the history of the Fair. In conclusion I wish to thank the members of the Board of Agri - culture, Fair officials, and all who took a part in making the Fair a success, and ospecal\v the very efficient help I had in the office and the Superintendent of Grounds.

I am sure this report of Secretary Reed covers the activities of the Fair in the last year in a very nice manner. I think he has given you a good idea of the activities and what has been done out there, and I want to say that there has been a great deal of work done for the amount of money that we had to do it with. I also want to call your attention to another matter that showed up in his report here. You will note that in his report here it showed that these 4-H Club beeves are selling at Lincoln for less than they are i at any other place. Now, that is wrong; if that continues there will be of course a discrimination against the Nebraska State Fair because </seg>

That is a matter, really, of local concern. ou take Omaha, in the Ak-Sar-Ben, they have pride there, and get out and bid on these steers at good prices. Some of these beeves went at a price too low, and as Mr. Reed's report shows they were below the market price in Omaha; that shouldn't be. Now, whether that is Lincoln or not I don't know, but I do know that we have only, I think, possibly one good bidder here that has interested himself in the bidding in of this livestock; that has been Mr. Gold, and we are under many obligations to Mr. Cold for his activities along the line of helping these -1-H Clubs. As you know, he has taken it on himself to give them a banquet at one of the hotels, and has been a very good bidder at the sales at the pavilion; but I hope something can be done so that these prices paid for these baby beeves in Lincoln will be up on par with the other paces. And remember this, gentlemen, that Nebraska in their l-H Club, under the direction of Mr. L. I. Frisbee, has made some very valuable winnings and done some good work for Nebraska and has urawn a lot of attention for Nebraska because their 4-H members have hcen good winners in their judging contests and in their production of beeves. Just while it comes to my mind—l don't want to take too much time- here, but last September duri-.ig the Fair we had a couple of visitors from Kingston, Australia. Dr. Condra, whom you all know, was e-oming over on the boat from Europe, and contacted these two gentlemen, a father and son who are large cattle and sheep men in Austrada. He brought them out to me and collared me and wanted me to take the gentlemen around, which I did. i took my car and put in practically a whole forenoon. They were fellows that run about twenty to thirty thousands head of sheep on the range in Australia, and a great number of cattle. They wanted to visit our sheep barn, so I took them over there. That show wasn't quite as big as I would like to have seen it, but they looked over the sheep, and wanted to know if they could get over in the pens. I said, "Yes, I don't think the superin - tendent will object." And they looked them over and one of them mad" the remark to me: "Your farmers in the United States will never get rid of the weeds on their farms until they put more sheep on them"; and I think that is a fact too, because weeds are costing Ne - braska farmers ?4,000,000.00 a year; so there may be something there for us to think about along that line. These are just things that come to my mind as I go along, and I mention them. And I took them further around to see the cattle, and they were very much interested, and when they left gave me a very cordial invitation if I ever go t to Australia to come over and visit them; but I don't think I will get that far. We will now have the treasurer's report. MR. E. R. PURCELL: Mr. President, and members of the State Roard of Agriculture: After listening to the report of the secretary, </seg>

Other than the year 1925, when he served as Superintendent of the Bees and Honey Department his position at the Fair was Assistant Superintendent of the Ticket and Information Department. He served continuously on this Board from the time of his election in 1924 until his death November 23, 1937. WHEREAS, GOD in his infinite wisdom, has taken from our : midst our esteemed friend and associate, A. W. Atkins, BE IT RESOLVED that we express our deep sorrow and extend to his family and friends our sincere sympathy in their bereavement. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this resolution be spread upon the records of the Association and a copy be sent to the family of the departed associate. Respectfully submitted, HENRY F.

First in order is nominations for president. MR. A.,H. MILLER: We have come now to a very serious part of our proiedure in pur deliberations, that of the selection of our presi - dent. I; is necessary that when we have a president we have a man who wi 1 head our great institution of which .we are proud and of which 'tpe state of Nebraska is proud, and that will not only carry forth the duties of his place, but a man that stands high in the hearts of the people of Nebraska, a man who has done much for the betterment of not only, agriculture, but for his countrymen, a' man who stands preeminent, not as a party politician, but as a man of aJI parties, all creeds, a man who always has been with us, always has stayed by. You can put your finger right on him. I know at times he is a little gruff, but his heart has been true. It isn't the exterior; it is what is within the diamond; maybe they are rough and unbecoming when taken from Mother Earth, but when polished by their contact with their fellow men, as the diamond is polished by contact with the emery wheel, stands forth in brilliance. This man has not only been a leader for the last two years, but will be a leader in the years to come. : I nominate our old friend, Bill Banning, of Union. A lELEGATE: T second the motion. j MR. SHUBERT: Gentlemen, you know when Brother Miller was making his nominating speech I thought of the story somebody told down at the banquet last night. You know, about when the preacher was conducting the funeral and told what a wonderful man the de - ceased was, and all that, and his old lady—the way I got it was that she had her daughter along beside her, you know, and she says, "Say, sister, will you look in there and see if your father is still there?" (Laughter) \ ¦'¦ ¦ ¦ So you have heard the brilliant motion—you know, I think it won't be long 1 until our good friend Miller will be a poet, he's commencing to sound like it already. Anyway all in favor of that motion make it known by saying "Aye". (Vote taken) The motion is carried unanimously, Mr. President, you are in. PRESIDENT BANNING: Gentlemen, I want to thank you for this confidence; and I assure you I have not paid Miller a dime for that speech he made, and I don't, intend to. MR. MILLER: It wasn't worth it. </seg>
         <seg id="p042">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRESIDENT BANNING: It was worth something, I am sure of that. I do want to thank you gentlemen; I think this is my twenty-ninth year with this Fair, and I have certainly enjoyed the work all the way through. I think the greatest pleasure I get out 6f this work is the acquaintances and new acquaintances that I make, and the friends that I make. lam interested in Nebraska just the same as you gentlemen, and I am interested in anything that will put Nebraska forward, and I assure you that I wish to do everything in my power; and I know that for the past I want to thank the Board of Managers and the County Fairs, who have given me loyal support; and I am courting that support again in 1938. (Applause) The next will be nominations for first vice president. MR. E. PRESTON BAILEY: At this time I wish to place in nomination a gentleman you have worked with for a number of years in one capacity or another, a gentleman who is held by his own community to be one of the outstanding men in that community, a man whom, as I have found, is dependable in every respect, and one whom we need in the State Board of Agriculture to iron out our [problems and troubles. I therefore wish to place in nomination at this time J. F. .Shubert. A DELEGATE: I second the nomination. PRESIDENT BANNING: Are there any further nominations? Gentlemen, I think in our regular course of business these nomi - nations should be made that the secretary be instructed to cast the ballot. MR. MILLER: Mr. Chairman, I move that the secretary be instructed to cast a unanimous ballot of the organization for Mr. Shubert as first vice president. Motion seconded, and upon being put to vote declared carried. PRESIDENT BANNING: The secretary will cast the yote of the organization for Mr. Shubert. SECRETARY REED: It is a pleasure for me to cast the entire vote of this convention for Mr. J. F. Shubert as first vice president. PRESIDENT BANNING: Next will be nominations for second vice president. A DELEGATE: Mr. Chairman, I wish to place in nomination the name of Mr. James Boyd, for second vice president. PRESIDENT BANNING: Are there any further nominations? </seg>
         <seg id="p043">I Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. SMILEY: I move that the nominations be closed and a unanimous ballot cast for Mr. Boyd.

PRESIDENT BANNING: Next in order will be nominations for treasurer. MR. CHAPIN: I have a good notion to make a speech. PRESIDENT BANNING: Well, go ahead, Mr. Chapin, we will give you time. . MR. CHAPIN: But I just haven't a thing that fills the bill. I suppose: many of you fellows have heard the old saying, or read it, that where your treasurer is there your heart is also.

VANCE: Mr. President, I am going to nominate an old timer too, but I am not going to agree to make the speech that my friend Miller did. ! Another reason that I am going to cut my remarks short is that I found out a few years ago that there is a psychological time to quit, and I remembered that. -. i So I am going to make my nomination speech right to the point and veiy short. lam going to nominate a manthat is an old timer, I thinkl he knows the Fair from A to Z and then some, and we pushed him into this job as secretary when things were beginning to get pretty tough, and he has had drouth to contend with every year, nearly, j since he has been in;, but he just tears right into this stuff and is going along fine, and I think we ought to put him back and keep him there until we get on our feet again anyway; and I am going to take pleasure in nominating Perry Reed for secretary. </seg>

         <seg id="p045">Report of Nebraska State Board, of Agriculture County Fairs come up against a good many propositions where some information on that would be of assistance to us; so do not hesitate at any time to offer any suggestions. Even though it be criticism we want it, because we can study it over and remedy it; so do not hesitate at any time to give us any information or assistance possible, and I assure you that the Board of Managers and the officers of the Nebraska State Fair stand ready at any time to be of any assistancs possible to you County! Fair men, and we want you to feel that we are at your service. MR. JOHNSON: I have something that I have thought of several times. It is a matter that might be something to think about. Iliad charge of the parade last year, and many of you maybe saw that parade, and I was very much impressed by what one county did in helping out in that parade in regard to floats. Now, I have been thinking that it would be possib'e for the coun - ties in eastern Nebraska that are within driving distance of th. City of Linco.n to bring their floats down to the State Fair if the State. Fair. Board could offer a premium for the best float in the parade brought in the day of the parade, and offer a good premium for first prize, second prize, arid whatever they might feel necessary in the number of prizes; however, offering $5.00 or $10.00, or $20.00 for any float that enters the parade. Now, in County Fair work,—not in a boasting way, but many of you that have seen some of the parades in the years past that were pulled off. in my County Fair will recall that it was a high spot of the Fair, the parade there. We always offered $5.00 for any float that was made. They were made by school districts, however, and then give a good prize for first, second, third, fourth and fifth. This is just an idea that I had that we could build up our parade and it would create more interest in the County Fairs in eastern Ne - braska especially that could drive in with their floats. Now, there is a man in this audience, Mr. Zikmund, the president of Butler County. I had the pleasure of visiting his Fair, and many of you saw the pictures of floats from his town, Brainard; in fact the ll'orM-_6'raW and some of the other papers had whole pages of the floats that were made in his town for the County Fairs and street parades. Now, if a state paper will think it is good enough to give a whole page of picture space, why wouldn't it be something to think about in building up our Nebraska State Fair on Wheels. Now, this, is a matter of course, for the Board to decide, but it might 7not be out of place for discussion. I will leave that to the Chairman. Thank you. PRESIDENT BANNING: We are very glad to get this sugges - tion; amd we will be glad to have any other suggestions. ¦ -,-•'. </seg>
         <seg id="p046">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. CHAPIN: I have a suggestion to make. I don't know how much merit there is in it, but this Fair is located adjacent to a city of 85,000 people. The Fair has no publicity down town. The papers are pretty shy in giving us free advertising; and I have before suggested, and want to again that the committee in charge of the streets make an arrangement, if possible, to have each day a band or two parade the city with an announcement of the Fair calling attention to the State Fair, and if possible some of the attractions with that. We are not getting the attention we ought to get out of the City of Lincoln, and I think a part of that is due to the fact that there is so little publicity calling the citizen's attention to Fair Week. I make this suggestion too; that in making arrangements for the bands for the coming year that if possible it be required from some of the bands that they furnish this publicity. PRESIDENT BANNING: I think that is a very good sugges - tion. MR. PORTER: I want to add to the gentleman's suggestion re - garding the parade a while ago. that a County Fair, no matter whether their Fair is held before or after the State Fair, if they will do some real work with a float it will work for the County Fair and the State Fair both. PRESIDENT BANNING: We have discussed this idea, and it had rather been one of my hobbies to try and get a parade down here; but it seems like it is a rather hard job to get that together, it will take some work beforehand. And another thing is that we don't dare ad - vertise anything but our Fair; we can't put anything in our parade that is an attraction, in the way of—say taking something off our midway, or something, because the city of Lincoln doesn't follow that idea; but I talked to the mayor about that very thing last year, and he was heartily in favor, and said, "We will give you the privilege" and all that; and I think that is a very, very good idea and we will try and put that in force, because I believe it is good to get some kind of publicity down town. Mr. Chapin has made a good suggestion there. Has anyone else any remarks or suggestions, any unfinished busi - ness of any kind? We want you to feel, as I said before, free to offer any suggestions or any criticism that you have. You know, the greatest thing and hardest job the Board of Man - agers has is to pick out, as I said yesterday, attractions that will take and that people will come to see. Now, gentlemen, again we are soon going to be confronted with another legislature. Nobody on this Board knows any better about what a grind it is to get finances to operate this Board, nobody knows what a hard job it is to get these legislatures to make appropriations to </seg>
         <seg id="p047">i Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture carry on this Fair, or even keep these buildings in repair out there. There were fellows sitting in this last session coming from farms and farming communities that voted against every proposition that was for th£ farmer; voted, against anything that -looked like the State Fair. These are not the sort of fellows to send to the legislature if you farmers expect to get any recognition; and I believe that each man that comes and asks for your sufferage ought to give you an idea where he stands on agriculture. No man that comes to this legislature or enters a state office will I ever vote for again unless he's for agri - culturL I am done with that sort of legislation. (Applauseh Farm activities get no consideration in the hands of this legislature—or didn'tfat; the last session. I know. I got behind bills there for the in - terestsNof the farmers; I got behind the creamery bill, it is one of the best things for bringing revenue to the farmers of Nebraska; and farmers would sit right up in that hall and fight against these bills. Now, jif we, as a representative organization, are going to get our just dues at the hands of the legislature let's send men there that are in sympathy with these agricultural activities, and we will get rid of all this trouble that we have. Think these things over; know what your representatives are going to do, know what kind of men thejr are. I have my opinions of the unicameral legislature, and I am not jgoing to ah them; and I suppose you.do, but we got through quite a;mess of legislation last winter at the hands of this legislature. Although they were employing three men that have legal talent to pass on all those bills, and so forth, still they come out with a mess of stuff, and I am really 1 disgusted with some of it; and I say that if the farming interests anil agriculture in Nebraska doesn't stand up for its own rights it isn't going to get any place, so think that over. .Are there any further remarks? I want to say first, and then entertain a motion to adjourn, that I think this has been one of the most successful meetings I have ever attented in my thirty years experience. We have had good talent, we have iiad good entertainment, everything was pleasant and the meetings moved along in the very best of shape, and that is what we want. What we want in the agricultural line is cooperation, and what we want in this Fair {work is cooperation from the County Fair up to the State Fair, and jfl-om the State Fair down. ./if there is nothing further a motion is in order to adjourn, gentle - men. j MR. R.R. VANCE: 1 move you that we adjourn, Mr. President. 'PRESIDENT BANNING:! You have heard the motion. All in favor] say, "Aye". Opposed, "No". Carried. We are adjourned. </seg>

         <seg id="p069">ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Held at Cornhusker Hotel, Lincoln, Nebraska. ..'":'-: Proceedings; of Monday, January 24, 1938. MR. STANLEY A. MATZKE, President: The convention will please come to order. We are back in Lincoln once again, the city we are always glad to be in. For many, many years we have met here on this certain day in January and enjoyed the hospitality of the city of Lincoln. This year we are particularly fortunate. We have had the utmost cooperation of the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce in the preparation for our convention. They have placed at our disposal a registration service, and have gone to a great deal of bother to make Ifincoln the city we would like to come to: and perhaps the finest thing they have done for us is that they have furnished us their mayor to give us the address of welcome at the beginning of our convention. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I introduce to you at this time Mayor Oren S. Copeland. Mayor .Copeland. MAYOR COPELAND: , Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen; you know I had no idea when I received the invitation to come over arid give you people an address of welcome today that your organization was anywhere near as large as your representation shows it to be. I thought perhaps we might have the County Fair Boards and perhaps the State Fair Board from.;: a few of our Nebraska counties, but I understand there are sixty some counties represented at your meeting, and it seems to me that it speaks very well, not only for the fairs that you will put on this coming year, but also for your organization. Ordinarily when a mayor delivers an address of welcome I can just imagine I can hear somebody heave a sigh and say, "Oh Lord, I suppose I will have to listen to one of those cut and dried (especially dry) addresses of welcome that we hear every place our assembly meets." And I am going to assure you that is one hundred per cent true; but your secretary invited me and asked me to come over here </seg>
         <seg id="p070">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and give an address of welcome, and dry or not, ladies and gentlemen, that is exactly what you are going to get. 1 do know the work you gentlemen are doing for the fair in Nebraska, not only in our city, but in the entire state, and I assume your work is somewhat along the same line as we do in our city council. You legislate, you policy fix, you lay down the rules and regulations under which your particular fairs operate; and that is what we do in Lincoln, and of course there is always one answer; we jret all the criticism. Some of it is constructive, some of it is not. You will find you will be congratulated one day and condemned the next; they will shake your hand on Monday and they will kick you on Tuesday; but after all it is part of the game, and part of ''¦ the job. and if the job is well done 1 don't believe that we have any particular criticism. I do feel that your organization, perhaps, is due to receive congratulations, perhaps as much as any organization that func - tions in the state. You have gone ahead and put on your fairs. You have made them bigger, you have made them better in the face &lt; of the most adverse conditions that Nebraska has ever had to face, and certainly a record of that sort is something that ought to bring you favorable comments. I met one of the theater men out in the lobby a few minutes ago and he reminded me of an incident that happened at our own State I Fair last fall. Of course I know this couldn't happen in any of your fairs; but it seems that one of the Omaha officials, not any in Lincoln, advised the press that there was a show being put on in one of the carnivals that was not fit for human consumption. Well, you know the next few days they had a record crowd at the State Fair; in fact 1 think the city council were all out there, in - cluding me, but we couldn't find anything; so I wondered whether or not that official wasn't on the payroll of the State Fair Board. We do have a lot of points of interest in Lincoln. I think you gentlemen have come to Lincoln often enough so that you are perhaps as familiar with them as we folks who live in Lincoln; our Capitol, our schools, our churches, and perhaps not the most important, a real football and a real basketball team. We get them in Lincoln twice. We get them during the football season and also during the State Fair, and we are hoping that during both of these occasions we may have the privilege of seeing all you people back in Lincoln again. I do think fairs are a wonderful thing for the State of Nebraska. They not only help the cities and towns in which you show, but help the agricultural community. The interests that you favor and </seg>
         <seg id="p071">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers promote, such, as your 4-H club work and your agricultural studies, without dcubt are worth a lot of money to every community in the state. I know that here.in Lincoln we of the council sort of figure we are executives, and: I am sure that on your boards you probably classify yourselves as executives, and I think it is true; and still I wonder. I read a definition of an executive this morning. I believe it was in the Literary Digest, in which they stated an executive was a mar who goes out and finds a lot-of work to be done, then goes out md finds somebody willing to pay for having the work done, and ;he third step is looking around and finding somebody else to do the work. If that is true, maybe some of us can't qualify as executives. .... ' I wanl; you gentlemen. to know that the City of Lincoln does welcome you; we welcome whoever comes to our fair city at all times, especially you from far but in the state. There is one thing, no : natter what happens to Lincoln we will never be short of, that is our spirit of hospitality. We are happy to see you here, and I want you to know that our welcome is sincere too, whether you come to attend a convention of the State Fair board, or on a shopping trip or on a visit, I want you to know the of - fices of the City of Lincoln are open to you at all times, and if there is anything we can do to help make your stay more pleasant I want you to feel free to call upon me or any official of the city of Lincoln, aid I assure, you we will do our best; arid I hope that you will a?] come back to us: very, very often. . I thank you. .7 PRESIDENT MATZKE: I want now to call upon our vice - president, ijoe Steele, of Kimball, Nebraska, for a response to this splendid address of welcome that Mayor Copeland has given. Joe Steele. ' j¦.!' ¦.'" ' ' ¦ ."¦. ' MR. STEELE: Mr. Mayor, friends; we want to thank you, Mr. Copeland, for tb7e wonderful address of welcome that sou have extended to us here this afternoon. We have always felt^that we were welcome in Lincoln. The citizens of Lincoln have demonstrated time and jagain that they are past riiasters in entertaining the stranger who comes to the city for a visit. I think the citizens of Lincoln; recognize their responsibility, in that they live in the Capital City of the state in their responsibility to extend the state's greetings to their visitors.

Before I introduce him I want to tell you of a little thing hat happened last year, and I see he took note of it and has tried o change the situation. After he was elected president of this associa - tion, as you know, we had a banquet, and at the banquet his wife discovered that he had been elected president for the coming year i! and she says. "Well, Stan," she says, "you are most too young a W man to head an organization of that kind." So in order to convince you that he s not so young any more, and also to convince his wif« that he has reached the stage of manhood, he has started a little demonstration over his upper lip which you probably have all noticed; i ] i </seg>

But at this time it gives me great pleasure to introduce our presi - dent, Mr. Matzke. ¦ PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you. Gentlemen, I have made a tremendous mistake, and I know it. It is once in a million years that I write something when I am to make a speech, and I took this serious enough to dictate a speech. I wish I didn't have it with me, because I have been told that when I read from a manuscript I am rotten, and when I speak without one I am just about as bad. A fellow once told me that when I make speeches I remind him of what Mac West once said "When I am good I am very, very good, when I am bad I am better." (Laughter.) The splendid number in attendance here this afternoon would cause manyj to wonder what it is about Fair work that will induce so many people to give of their time and energy, to neglect their busi - ness and family, to spend of their money and subject themselves to public criticism and condemnation, in order that a certain Fair shall succeed and that "The Fair" as an institution shall serve a useful purpose. '-[¦.'- •' ' ¦'. i A brother lawyer, whose entire conception of life is expressed in that odd;little character of two perpendicular lines superimposed on an "S", commonly called the Dollar Mark, once asked me why I wasted so much time on such an unremunerative and thankless job - as Secretary of a County Fair. I told him that it was purely a matter of-personal satisfaction and. inspiration. That, after associat - ing with lawyers throughout the year it was a real pleasure and wholesome inspiration to once each year, for a few days, to b'c privileged to associate with the comparatively unselfish, broadminded, honest, livei and let live people who x-un the "chuck luck" games, the - hula-hula shows, the fortune telling joints and the penny pitch on our County Fair Midway. : ;. And the fellow thought I was jokiiij;- Often we are accused of ha^pig ulterior motives whicn prompt our activity. I confess to motiyes for my participation in Fair work that to those who do not understand are probably hidden and questionable. Whether we recognize it or not I am of the opinion that our interest in "The Fair" is dictated by various motives—economic, cultural, sociological and as my story will later reveal, perhaps biological. Robert Moses, writing of the New York World's Fair of 1939, in last week's Saturday Evening Post, states: "There have been Fairs, since the mists of antiquity lifted.

Ij The story might run something like this: The maker of sine hatchets, through tirele^ application to his task, had a surplus' of these instruments, which he could not dispose of in his immediate Mc.n.ty. F„r all of his large store of hatchets, however, his heart was heavy. His mate, the apple of his eye and the joy of his he had grown tired of wearing a goatskin breech cloth, and desired uth al „f her hear, t„ have one made of the beautiful skin of the leopard At the same time in a not far distant cave village, the mate of the leopard hunter was also very unhappy. Although her lord and master had been able to furnish her with the best of everything that then- immediate vicinity yielded, he had been unable to get one of hos e new stone |__.het_. rumors of which had floated to their httle community, and she was daily ,n fear as he went forth to kill the leopard with his bare hands that he might not return at night - fall If she could only get him one of those new stone hatchets, he , would not only be safer, but could kill more leopards, make more ' breech cloths, trade them for more of the things they needed to properly bring up an ever increasing family. One day the maker of stone hatchets and the wife of the Jeopard hunter, worrying over their respective troubles wandered "I quite far into the country surrounding their respective native caves, and directed by a kindly fate, met in a forest. Their initial fear of each other was soon dispelled by the beauty of the day, the warmth [ } of the sun, the whispering of the gentle breeze, the singing of the ! j _I - , e''e * eaCh WaS confidine t0 the other, the worries !

         <seg id="p079">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers was beautiful, the sun warm, the wind was again whispering those sweet nothings that the wind whispered 10,000 years ago, and the birds were singing in the trees, and the hearts of our friends were filled to overflowing by the attainment of that happiness which came from the realization that they had each procured that for which they so long had sought. Their thoughts first turned to the happiness which their respective mates would receive from their gifts; then they dwelled upon the economic shortcomings of a situation which deprived others of the benefits of a free exchange of goods, and, as the length - ening shadows of the trees faded into the dusk, as the whispering of the wind ceased, and as the singing of the birds melted into the subdued chirpings of a. forest nightfall, the hatchet maker expressed regret that in all probability they would never see each other again. In this enchanted hour, Mother Nature, ever watchful of the welfare of her children, played her trump card, for above the distant hills, spotting the forest fastness with white and gold, arose that, which today is known as the harvest moon. And ere these two had parted to find their way back to their respective caves, the Wife of the leopard .hunter had suggested and the stone hatchet maker had readily agreed that they would each return to their native communities and throughout the coming months promote a gathering to be held, in this same forest, twelve moons hence to which all should bring the products of their making, for exchange and barter. Thus, from varied and conflicting emotions and motives, was conceived that instrument of civilization which became known as "The Fair". '¦¦ The fact that in a neighboring cave to the leopard hunter lived a spinster, who had married the Village headshaver, after the leopard hunter had turned her down, and that this spinster, having seen the mate of the, leopard hunter returning to the Village in the wee small hours of tie morning, had started many vicious rumors and much gossip, and that the devoted wife of the leopard hunter, interested only in the welfare of her mate, was forced to tax her mental abilities to the limit in explaining to the leopard hunter where she had gotten pie stone hatchet, has nothing to do with our story. Her motives in promoting the idea were questioned, her activities criticized severely, and many stories not founded on fact became current about the VillageJ but this phenomenon of human nature, having survived to the present day, it is needless for me to spend time thereon. j. .... -. '¦ - ..-..- By a combination of somewhat similar circumstances, the stone hatchet makez- met -with somewhat similar difficulties, and although he had been successful in obtaining for his mate that which she most desired, his j marital life did not run smoothly, but that also is a sit - uation which today needs no explanation. Many a sleepless night he passed ere twelve moons had gone by. </seg>
         <seg id="p080">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Suffice it to say that at the appointed time, and under another smiling sun, and another harvest moon, the maker of stone hatchets, the weaver of goat's hair, the leopard hunter, the molder of clay pots, the grinder of corn, and all others who produced things in surplus which others could use, met in the forest to display and exchange the products of their efforts. Much trading and bartering was done, new ideas were exchanged and discussed, new friends were made, and last, but very significant, the leopard hunter and the hatchet maker staged an exhibition, a sample of which, although in a much degenerated form, we are still privileged to witness in the grunt and groan wrestling matches, for which purpose our State Fair Board furnishes the use of one of its buildings. By the time another twelve moons had passed, news of this gathering had spread to many other tribes and caves, and the "Second Annual Cave Man's County Fair and Exhibition" was a huge success. And bpforc its conclusion, the committee on arrangements announced that at the next year's Fair the best made hatchet, the best goat's hair undergarment, the most artistic clay pot, and the finest ground corn, would each be awarded a prize of one exceptionally fine, latest style, hand embroidered leopard skin breech cloth. The detailed development of "The Fair" can be here left to your imagination, except to make note of the fact that at the Third An - nual Gathering the grinder of corn, having brought with him- a goatskin bag full of unground corn to show his customers the high quality of the grain from which his product was made, found himself operating a Bingo garni-, and offering as prizes therein handsomely hand decorated packages of cnrnmeal and pancake flour. The place that the Fair has filled in the exchange and distribu - tion of goods, in offeving an opportunity for the exchange of ideas, in promoting sociability and good fellowship, in furnishing amusement and in furthering the arts and sciences is traceable through all his - tory, Egypt. Greece. Rome. England. About the year 1753, Black - stone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of England, wrote on Page '271 thereof "With us in England, the King's prerogative, so far as it relates to mere domestic commerce, will fall principally under the following articles: First, the establishment of public marts, or places of buying and selling, such as markets and fairs, with the tolls thereunto belonging. These can only be set up by virtue of the King's grant, or by an immemorial usage and prescription, which preproposes such a grant. The limitation of these public resorts to such time and such place as may be most convenient for the neighborhood, forms a part of economics, or domestic policy, which, considering the king - dom as a large family, and the King as the master of it, he clearly, has a right to dispose and order as he pleases." </seg>
         <seg id="p081">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers, The evolution of the Fair is variously recorded in the law of our land, an example being the case of Collins vs. Cooper, 17 Cox 647, wherein Bruce Justice says, "in modern times the commercial import - ance of Fairs has greatly diminished and. the amusements which ac - company the holding of Fairs often excite more attention.than the buying and selling. But it seems to me that this circumstance does not alter the meaning of the word "Fair". I cannot find any authority for the use of the word "Fair" as applied to a wake, or a show, or an exhibition. A cattle Fair still means a Fair where cattle are sold, a fancy Fair where fancy articles are sold. There are many occasions where shows and exhibitions are gathered together, for instance, at horse race meetings, at boat races, at great football matches, and other outdoor meetings; yet I think that such gatherings cannot be properly spoken of as Fairs. The Fair mentioned in the old song to which the young man went to buy blue ribbon for his sweetheart may have been a pleasure fair, but it was a~ Fair at which blue ribbon was sold and I;suppose other commodities." In the same case, the Justice reaches this conclusion "every Fair is a market, but every market is not a Fair." '•': The function of "The Fair" in the exchange and distribution of goods has been taken over by new methods of transportation, by a more complex system of marketing, by the establishment of a medium of exchange and other institutions of advancing civilization. But when we, today, ;see millions of workers unemployed, hungry men, whose brawn and skill could produce furniture, clothing, building material and much more that the other laborers and farmers need, and at the same time we see the tillers of our soil with lands, ability and energy to raise food stuffs enough to feed to satisfaction every hungry belly in America, might we be entirely wrong in suggesting that it .^niigrht be well in our consideration of the problem of exchange and distribution of goods, that we divest our minds of the complexities and folderols of our present system by starting bur thinking processes with a consideration of that primitive means of exchange and distribu - tion, "The Fair". ..'.-- -¦ - | -¦. ¦ ¦ . - '-='..-.¦.- . • . . In calling your attention to other worthwhile and interesting func - tions of "The Fair" I will again quote the article in last week's Saturday Evening Post. "There;have been Fairs since the mists of antiquity lifted. The early ones were glorified markets to which people came to show their wares, to barter and to trade. Amusements were! a natural addition. A pleasant relief from the main business and an excuse for bringing the familyalong.

In casting about for a program here that would be interesting, instructive and worthwhile we came more or less to the conclusion that we would get the most benefit from an exchange of ideas with people who are located in Nebraska in County Fair work, and our program has been lined up from that standpoint, of getting the ideas and suggestions from people you know. In looking around for someone to bring us a worthwhile message, we have ob - tained one who perhaps has been as much interested as most of us in County Fair work, and he has been successful in running a County Fair. We have asked this man because of the type of Fair he runs, and the type of individual he is, to tell something about running worthwhile Fairs, and we were successful in obtaining for our speaker's list Mr. Hueftle, from Eustis, who will speak to you at this time on the subject of "Worthwhile Elements of a Fair." I am mighty glad to introduce to you and call to the front Mr. G. C. Hueftle. </seg>
         <seg id="p087">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers' MR. HUEFTLE: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, my subject is "The Worthwhile Elements of a Fair". : Every Fair Board pays a tribute to its own community when they hold a Fair. The fair itself ;is a composite picture of the com - munity's activities and achievements. A community sees itself in their Fair much in the same way as a person sees his own reflection in a. mirror, Rambling through tho country general store, a hillbilly came across the first mirror he had ever seen. '. "Say," he exclaimed, "here's a picture of my '•: gran'pappy. How much do you.want for.it?" . "Three dollars," said the clerk. . The old man paid over the three dollars and started home with the mirror. Getting near, he decided he'd better not let the old lady find that he had paid so much for a picture of his gran'pappy, so he hi-,i it in the hay-loft. Each day he would go dawn and :pend long minutes with it. Becoming worried about his long visits to the barn, the old lady followed the old man, and, at the first opportunity, took a look into the mirror for her own self. ¦'.' "Oh, yes!" she exclaimed, a few minutes later as she threw the flat-iron at the old man's head, "I see why you spend so much time at the barn—down there looking at that hussy's picture." Every picture is true in proportion to the degree in which it reflects the outstanding characteristics of the community or individual. In other . w irds, our Fair is a parade in which we see ourselves going by. It is a good thing for each community to take a good look at itself at leant once a year. Naturally, every community dresses up a bit for the occasion for we want to look our best. I am taking it for: granted that most of us live in Nebraska because we want to—that'is, we. like it here. Living in Nebraska makes it necessary for us to do the things that can be done in Nebraska. Every state places certain limitations on the activities of its people by reason of the basic element of which: it is made. Nebraska has no oil wells, no coal mines of any great importance, no gold, silver or diamond mines. Fundamentally, Nebraska has only one thing, one substance that we can work with. That one substance is soil. All that we achieve and accomplish in our state is directly or indirectly related to the soil. Our basic industry is agriculture. Agri - culture is not only a necessary industry, but it is one that is most commendable, most laudible, because it provides those things which </seg>
         <seg id="p088">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture give sustenance to the people; and when the people of a state or nation are properly sustained in a physical way, they are apt to be better and stronger mentally and physically, and likely to be in better condition to do those things that add to the progress of civilization; and so agriculture is not only our basic industry but it is fundamentally the basic industry of all things throughout the world. In other words, if you live in Nebraska you're a farmer, and you can't get very far away from it. Certainly, you may be doing dif - ferent work but the roots of your business draw their sustaining nourishment from the soil. Our relations to the soil are more than economic, they are sacred. We are custodians of the bountiful land - its waters, its plant and animal life, its hidden riches; and perhaps most important of all, its soil. For, upon the conservation of produc - tive lands depends the life span of civilization. As we subdue and re - plenish the good earth, so we express our obligation to our fellow men of the present as well as of the future. Nebraska has become great, and has taken her place among the nation's richest through the intelligent use of her one and only resource. If our state is to maintain this enviable position and keep milk and honey flowing within our borders, so we may share our plenty with the tables of the world, we must sustain the basic industry that has made us great, and make our broad acres yield vast stores of corn and wheat, and hay and oats, and potatoes and sugar beets. Sleek cattle must graze in our pasture lands, and fat hogs must crowd our pens. Our butter and cheese and eggs and meat must remain known in the far-flung markets. From the bounty of her soil alone the people of Nebraska have built schools and churches, art galleries and colleges, and our great State University. In the center of the former great prairies the skyline has been cut with that architectural triumph, the Nebraska State Capitol. The giant statue of The Sower is looking out across fruitful acres, and finds them fertile soil. If our fairs are to do their part in building up our state, we must get back to the basic principle as provided by the statutes of the state, which say that Fairs shall be organized for the promotion of agriculture, and then we must continue to sustain a constructive policy, a policy that will conserve and restore her soil, that will develop and enrich her people. And now, in all of our remembering, let us not forget that every County Fair in the State, and the great State Fair as well, should pay tribute to our peaceful farms, our prospering towns and cities, and to the deep-etched memories of pioneering days; and finally most </seg>
         <seg id="p089">j. Nebraska Association op Fair 'Managers of all, to the men and women who wrested nobly from the soil our rich and fadeless heritage. .- PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you very much, Mr. Hueftle. I knew thai when we called upon Mr. Hueftle to assist us with our program that he would have something for us that would be well thought out and that it would be worthwhile and interesting to us as Fair men. Thank you very, very much. You noticed that on our program we have left no particular place for the discussion of those questions which all County Fair men are interested in. It is our idea from time to time when we have a few minutes oh our hands to discuss questions in which you might be interested. I am wondering if we could not now devote ten or fifteen minutes to an open discussion of questions in which some of you mi'irht want enlightenment or advice from other County Fair men. I don't see any hands now, so if any of you have questions you would 1 ke to have discussed, if you will write them up and leave them on the desk we will call them up at different times. There were some questions sent in, and they were: The respective merits of a three and four days Fair; the reports on entertainment from all County Fairs; the proposition of circuits for the purpose of hiring cam yals and free acts; Four H Club judging rules at the State Fair; and the night program at the County Fair. There were some other questions sent in that got in too late for me to list them on our program. One of them, I think, was the proposition of enlightenment on how a County Fair can go about getting all it is entitled to' from its County funds through the Board of Commissioners. 7 Now, if there is anybody here that would like to open the dis - cussion on any of these questions, we would just be mighty glad to have you get to your feet and tell us, either by asking a question, or telling us the solution. Who was it that was interested in three and four day Fairs? Do I see a hand? Who was interested in that discus - sion? Is Howard Rhea of Washington County here? ¦'.".-.'• i. .-' : - ¦¦: ¦:-¦¦ - ;¦-. MR. RHEA: Yes. PRESIDENT MATZKE: I think you are the one that put that question to me. MR. RHEA: We were very much interested in knowing the ex - periences that anybody else has had in going from four to jthree day Fairs. !ln our County we feel possibly we could get just as much money in a three day Fair as we could in four, and we would like to have the experiences of any of the other fellows on that line. In our Northwest Fair Association we have talked about circuits, that is, going to a three day Fair and running two Fairs a week, </seg>
         <seg id="p090">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and we would like to know the reception the Fairs over the State would have to that. MR. RAUN of Thurston county: I am going to give a little talk on that tomorrow morning, and if it is permissible I would like to ask if the circuit proposition can be retained until tomorrow. I have done a little bit of work on it, I don't know as I have accomplished a great deal, but I would be glad to present the findings that I have made, at least on that proposition tomorrow, and ifi you will retain that ques - tion until tomorrow I think it should be dime. While I have the floor I would like to call the attention of this gathering to the paper that was sent out by Mr. Marshall on the reports on entertainment. I think that it is very important from the standpoint of the different Fairs in getting an accurate report on the different free acts that have shown at your Fair; and that is how I happened to request the President to bring this matter up for dis - cussion and ask for these reports, and while we have Wanks for those reports on the President's desk, I think each County should get a blank ami fill one out and turn it in. I just wanted to call your attention to the fact. I think all of you at some time or other have been stung on free acts, and all of us have had good results as a result of our free acts. Fortunately for us in Thurston County last year we were highly pleased with our free acts, and I thought it might be interesting to County Fairs to know what free acts we booked, and who it was; and therefore I thought a report of the respective Fairs as to the booking agency they had done business with, as to what acts they had, whether or not they were satisfactory, what acts didn't please and what acts they had did please. Now, if we had a report from each and every County Fair. Now, on these blanks there is a place for the name of the agent, and if you had six acts put down the names of the acts, the length of time it took the act to perform, and how the act went over with the people. Now, if the act goes over with the people in Thurston County and it's gone over with the people in Seward County, the chances are that it will go good with your Fair, and vice versa; therefore, we don't have to buy a pig in a poke if we have a report that is unbiased and unprejudiced, and if it has stood the test of seeing and hearing by the people of Nebraska. Now, if those reports are filled out I know that 1 for one will go to the secretary's desk and look them over, and if I find out that Mr. XYZ sold three acts to the Howard Couny Fair, and if they were highly pleased with the outcome of the acts, then I feel that in Thurston County as a result of that report we would have some idea of what we are buying if we bought the same acts you bought last year. </seg>
         <seg id="p091">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers I would like to hear from someone else on that proposition; but I do believe it would be of value to each and every Fair. PRESIDENT MATSKE: Thank you, Mr. Raun, I think your idea is good. Mr. Raun will deliver a paper here tomorrow on the propo - sition of circuits, so we will not discuss that question; but I would like to have further discussion on the entertainment proposition. The very thing Mr. Raun speaks of happened in our county this past year. We got up against it and at the last minute had to get a group of acts, and we got some swell looking advertising, and the finest kind of reports on it from up in Montana; but either it wasn't what the advertising said it was or else it lost its quality during the j trip down, because by the time it got to Seward it was putrid. They are not present here today, however. I thinklthe idea is good and it might save sOme County Fair that needs the money badly $250.00 or: $500.00 some year. I would like to hear other ideas on this subject. MR. J. F. SORRELL, Secretary of the Otoe County Fair, from Syracuse, . ebraska: I heartily endorse this,! however, I haven't filled out my shejt yet, but I will be up and do so, Mr. Marshall. I have had a lot if things to do lately and just didn't get around to it. I speak, I believe, or am going to cry or lean on your shoulders, or perform some kind of a little ditty here at seven-thirty this eve - ning, and I have got part of that in my speech, so I suppose it's going to be just like our other man on the floor or gentleman on the floor, ies going to cover part of that other question in his speech. However, that is a very important part of any Fair, and the success that it is going to have depends on your entertainment. jAfter all, it's all supposed to be educational and entertaining, and if you get something that is entertaining you are going to have a satisfied crowd. There is no doubt about that. Of course that is just part of the program, and as to the different kinds of entertainment you can have to help an agricultural Fair I am going to cover that quite fully in my address this evening if they care to come back and listen; but I will say right now that the best is none too good, and sometimes it pays to shop. ANDY WELCH, Chairman of the Seward County Associati°n: The question, as it seems..to me, before the house is'coming from a four day Fair to a three day Fair. The proposition with the Board in my County is that it will pay us to go to a three day Fair in place of a four day Fair in the way of expenses. We will say that in the four day Fair you start to close your registration and have one entertainment for the day, then you have the two full days, then the fourth day you have your entertainment in the afternoon and nothing in the evening. Our experience from the financial standpoint </seg>
         <seg id="p092">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has been that the fourth day was a sort of expense to us. We have run behind the hounds for the past five years on the fourth day. We haven't thoroughly made up our minds whether the "jinx" as we call it, the fourth day was Friday or what. I was glad to hear the question asked as to the four day or three day Fair; we think that we will go to the three day Fair in the future. MR. RHEA: I will say to the gentleman that our experience has been good. Last year we tried the four day Fair, we had always had a three day before. We had approximately 50,000 people in the four days; we had probably eight thousand the first day, twelve thousand the second day, the third day was Friday and we let the school children in free and had approximately 20,000 people, and we run on until Saturday, and Saturday we had around 12,000 and our mutuels on Saturday were the biggest day we had. It seemed like a money maker to us and we are going in for it. next year. We like the four day Fair out there. Of course it depends on what kind of a community it is, and we have a terribly large territory to draw from, and there were lots of people that couldn't get away and go the first three days and waited until the last day. We did have one bang up Fair. We had nearly $30,000.00 that went through the mutuels in the four days, and nearly 50,000 in attendance; we are going to keep the four day Fair. PRESIDENT MATZKE-. Thank you. Who desires the floor next? Is there anybody else that has any ideas they wish to express on this proposition? 1 think our experience in Seward County was perhaps due partially to the fact that last year, as far as Seward County people were concerned, they had spent all the money they had to spend on Fairs during the first three days; everybody with money to spend came in Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. That situation would partially cure itself if we had rain in this country. I have heard this remark by old Fair men: "That you can't have a Fair on Friday", it's quite a taboo, or tradition. Do any of you have any experience with that question? MR. WATKINS, Antelope County: Speaking about Friday, we have never had a Friday Fair, but this year we are talking of starting our Fair entry day on Friday; then starting the Fair Friday morning and running Saturday, Sunday and Monday; we wondered if that would be better. We were thinking of doing that mainly for tho children on Saturday, to have the children's day when there was no school, and so the merchants of our County could get out and at - tend when lots of them couldn't otherwise. I would like to ask anyone, if there is anyone here who have Fairs on those dates, if it pans out pretty good. We have never tried a Sunday Fair, but we </seg>
         <seg id="p093">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers thought of having a good speaker talk at 10:30, and some singers and social entertainment, and then carry on the program as usual in the afternoon. We were just wondering. if that would work out good. PRESIDENT MATZKE: May I see the hands of any of those that have Fairs that run over a Sunday? Just one. MR. E. M. BAUMANN,. Gumming County: We start ours on Sunday/ PRESIDENT MATZKE: Would you tell us your experience with your Sunday Fair? MR. BAUMANN: We started our Fair; originally a three day Fair, running Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Then we thought we would.start on Monday evening, and that jworked out pretty fine; then the first thing we know we started Monday noon with a baseball game, and as a rule somebody had a baseball game on the Fair grounds on the Sunday before, so we figured that if we started on Sunday we might as well have the whole works as to have somebody else butting in on the Sunday before. So when we started the Sunday program we started with a sacred concert in the evening, then we drifted into the baseball and now we are starting our Fair Sunday noon, starting with a baseball'game, then entertainment in the evening, and we like it very much and wouldn't think of changing it at all. It worked out fine for us. We have been running a couple of baseball tournaments on the .fifth day. \ ¦¦'¦/¦'!.. PRESIDENT MATZKE: You have a five day Fair? MR. BAUMANN: Yes. !- PRESIDENT MATZKE: When are your entry days; Saturday? MR. BAUMANN: Yes, Saturday up to noon on Sunday, the fact of the matter is we close it at 9:00 o'clock Sunday morning. . PRESIDENT MATZKE: Do you have a paid admission? MR. BAUMANN: Yes sir. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Go right ahead. MR. HENRY F. KUHL, Knox County: We have tried a three day Fair, four day Fair and five day Fair. We have gone back now to the three day Fair, and find it is more economical and profitable, and I rather think we will stay on the three day Fair proposition. We used to start on Monday;.. morning, but we have changed now and have entry day following the State; Fair on Saturday, then we start the Fair on Sunday noon, and Monday and Tuesday. We like it very much, and find that our acts do too, as they can play two </seg>
         <seg id="p094">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Fairs a week; and I think we shall continue holding the Fairs on those days; at least that seems to be the opinion now. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you, Mr. Kuhl. P. P. CEDER, Nance County: We have tried having five days, four days and three days. While we had the five days everybody had.a lot of money, then we got it down to four days when they had a little less, now we have got it down to three days. We have been running it Wednesday, Thursday and Friday; I believe Thursday, Friday and Saturday would be better days, but of course the business men don't like to have the Fair on Saturday because they like to be at home tending to business, but I don't believe they would lose business at that. 1 believe the crowd would pay out better on Satui-day. We have run over onto Sunday on account of rain, of course that is unusual, we don't have rain now, and that doesn't bother, but we have had one on Sunday and made good at it, but now there is no object having it on Sunday on account of rain. It may be better for some people to run five days, or four days, but with us we like a three day Fair. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you, Mr. Ceder ( Does anyone have any further ideas on this three day Fair— on the three, four or five day Fair? There have been some very in - teresting points brought out here that I know will be of benefit to you. All of you fellows who haven't been down here before, we want you to feel free to get to your feet and express your idea's. MR. BAUMANN: Just one other thought I had. We always figured up there in Cuming County that if you have a three day Fair and get rained out on the second day you only have got one left, and if you postpone it it doesn't amount to very much. If you have got a four day, or five day fair there is more left. We have been very fortunate up there in being rained out at least one day, or part of a day. MR. RHEA: The reason we went to the four day Fair is that we found that when we had our revue it didn't cost us any more for four days than for three days. We spent nearly $4,000.00- for free entertainment, and it didn't cost any more for four days than for three, so we just put it on. PRESIDENT MATZKE: It is my opinion that when you have parimutuel races running with your Fair it alters the situation con - siderably. The first day a man hears about the races, the second day he goes to watch them, the third day he places a little bet and breaks even, the fourth day he places another bet and wins some money and then on the fifth day he comes back to make a cleaning. You have got to build up your proposition, and there might be a wide </seg>
         <seg id="p095">j Nebraska Association of Fair Managers difference between Fairs using parimutuels and the Fair that does not use them. I would like to have some further ideas on this, lefs keep it going if we can. A DELEGATE: We changed our Fair from a ! three day to a four day Fair, and it's been very successful. We have our Fair days Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Wednesday is! entry day, and we have what you might call a three: day Fair, but we found we had better horses if we have a three day race. On the two day' Fair a lot of our exhibitors refuse to set up on a short Fair. It takes too long a time to get their stuff out there and get it set up, and as a man said here, if you have one rainy day it cuts the Fair even shorter. We are billing a three day entertainment, and entry day, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, j A DELEGATE: Mr. President,: may 1 ask a question? In connection with the parimutuels and the free Fair, how do you manage to get your income? Down at our Fair we don't have a race track, however, there are ; several interested, but we have our County help, just a small levy down there, and we get $2,000.00 a year through taxation to'hold a free Fair; but, if we had parimutuel racing there and charged for it, isn't it a fact that you don't get that County assistance?; -.", MR. BANNING: You get it, sure. -7 • PRESIDENT MATZKE: The parimutuel racing has nothing what - ever-to do with, the $2,000.00 of County assistance. If your county has a duly constituted agricultural society, organized at least somewhere near according to law and is paying premiums, the County Board must help you up to $2,000.00 for the payment of premiums. If,you had a free j gate, then .you can use part of this $2,000.00 for the pay - ment of other expenses. It is $2,000.00, but with a free gate it does not all have to be used for the payment of premiums, it can be used for other purposes; but your parimutuel has nothing to do at all with the provision that the County Board must help County Fairs. A DELEGATE: Will they permit charging a,t your grandstand? PRESIDENT MATZKE: Yes. :'.;¦ iMR. J. F. SORRELL: There are a lot of people in Syracuse interested in the parimutuel, and we have ambition if they keep the parimutuel going to get a race track down there sometime. We don't know just how to go about it, or how to continue after we get it. Do you get income enough so that it really pays to have pari - mutuel abo"e what success you would have without it? We wonder if we set the parimutuel racing up down there if it would pay us good in the end to go to.a lot of hard work: and a lot of expense to get a .rase track. Would it be an asset to the Fair? We already have a very fine little county Fair, I believe, don't we Mr. Banning? </seg>
         <seg id="p096">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. BANNING: That is right, one of the most successful in the State. MR. SORRELL: I believe it is, I have discussed that with a lot of business men down there at Syracuse, whether we would profit by a race track, or whether we should just go ahead and tend to our knitting and have a nice little free Fair. Of course if it is worth while we would be interested in doing it. I wish someone could tell us whether it would pay us or not when we already have ;i very successful free Fair. If it would pay us, of course we want to get bigger and better, but if it doesn't we want to let well enough alone. MR. J. C. HASTINGS, Polk County. Do I understand you to answer this question that this $2,000.00 can't be paid out for any - thing except premiums for agricultural purposes; isn't the law to the effect that it can't be paid for anything else but livestock and agri - cultural premiums. PRESIDENT MATZKE: No, the law doesn't provide what it shall be paid for. If you have a pay gate Fair the County must allow this up to $2,000.00 for premiums alone; if you have $1,500.00 of premiums they have got to furnish you $1,500.00. If you have a free gate Fair, then they have got to furnish you with $2,000.00. MR. HASTINGS: But not for entertainment? PRESIDENT MATZKE: Not for entertainment, not in either case. MR. A. U. RAIN, Thurston County: In answer to this other man's question. I see that we have the secretary of the State Racing Commission here, Mr. Cullen. He received reports from each and every County Fair that has held race meets. I think Mr. Cullen is in a good position to tell us the financial outcome on race meetings that have been held; so I would like to call on Mr. Cullen to answer this question. PRESIDENT MATZKE: I was going to remind you gentlemen interested in this that Mr. Cullen is having a meeting in his room, 620, immediately following adjournment of this meeting, at which that very matter will be fully discussed; and at tonight's program A. E. Wenke, of Stanton, Nebraska, who has had considerable experi - ence in running races down at their Fair, will give us a paper he has prepared, and he knows considerable about the matter. I think after Mr. Cullen's meeting and Mr. Wenke's talk you will understand it better. MR. CULLEN: This is the first year that we have had a report from all the Fairs on the amount of premiums that have been paid, which qualifies them for the payment of their share of the racing funds. However, we do have a report from every County that has </seg>

I think that most of the County secretaries will tell you that they have had an improvement in their financial status since they have put in their racing. In some cases they have saved on free acts; but in most cases they increased their attendance, especial - ly the grandstand attendance, or grandstand receipts. I think j that if any of you men that are interested will discuss this with the fellows who have put it on they will agree that it has been an improvement. Another! thing is that where you have had racing and it hasn't been supervised if you take on the mutuels and have it supervised it will be much better. I have jail those statements in my room, and I would be glad to go into it with, any of you personally, showing just what it costs to get started, and what it costs to handle a race meet. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Don't forget after this meeting is over lo' go up to j Mr. Cullen's room, 620, and he will go into the matter. I hope youj will pardon me for having allowed the discussion to ramble, but in my opinion it is just like a private conversation; we get into he thing better if we let it take its natural course. Unless we get too far from the subject it is my opinion that our interests are best: served by allowing the matter to ramble along; but we now must get akng with our program. There a-e some show people here now who weren't here when we introduced them. I will now give them an opportunity to present themselves. ! Mrs. Thmias, were you here when we introduced them? MRS. THOMAS: No, I wasn't. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Mrs. Thomas, I will state, is furnishing some acts ft r our banquet program tomorrow night. Her address is Rome Hotel, Omaha. . PRESIDENT MATZKE: When we arranged the program wo were very much pleased when we received the consent of an old County Fair J man from out here in Polk County to appear on our program. We asked him to choose his own subject, and I don't think he could have done better than to have chosen the subject he has for presentation on this occasion. If there is one thing that we as County Fair people are interested in it is what we can do to better the State Fair, to what extent we can use our efforts and the direction in which we can use our efforts to better serve the purposes of our State Fair; and we will now have the privilege of listening to Mr. Jay Hastings', </seg>
         <seg id="p098">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of Osceola, on the subject of "What County Fairs can Do for the State Fair." Mr. Hastings. MR. HASTINGS: I do not want to take up too much of your time because I know you are getting tired and are anxious to get back to your rooms, or other places. The subject that has been given me to talk upon this afternoon, I believe, is one of the most important matters to our County Fairs as the Chairman says. It is close to my heart, I believe in it. Now, it can be taken from .several different angles, but I am only going to take it from one way, because if I didn't you would stay here all night, and I am not going to keep you here all night. I am like a Methodist preacher in one way, I always believe in taking a text. That text of mine is going to be "teamwork". I claim that with proper teamwork there is nothing but what can be accomplished; but in the past gentlemen, you know it, we have got to pulling away from each other in the State; before that we pulled togeher, and when we pulled together and had that old teamwork this old State Fair ground was full and «ur County Fair grounds were full; but we have got to a point now where it is everybody for himself and the Devil take the hindmost, and the old boy has about got us unless we get back and have that old team - work of pushing and pulling together. I will name a few ways in which to my way of thinking we can get there. I understand that we have about ninety County Fairs in the State of Nebraska, and they have twelve officers to each Fair. Supposing that you made them a walking delegation, walking boosters for the State Fall - al! over; you can imagine but one thing, that the old State Fair ground would be crowded from gate to gate, from fence to fence and that the old ghost of debt that has hung over us for years would be lifted. Gentlemen, we can do it with just a little effort on our part; that ,s. all together. They can't do it alone. I believe, though, that the County Fairs have been reluctant to say anything about the State Fair for fear that it will draw people away from their Fair and they would Ko to the State Fair; the State Fair has been afraid to say anything about the County Fairs for the simple reason that they are afraid that people will go to the County Fairs and then will have all the Fair they want and will not attend the State Fair. That is far, far from the fact, and you know it; we have got to stop thinking that way. We are like a railroad system, we are the branch lines and the feeders, and the State Fair is the main line-it is the very heart. Without the success of one the other can't be a success, it is but a question of all working together; but there are a lot of these managers that will go into the association to go to your Fair meetings, and they want to be elected to some office, they are proud of it, and when they are elected 10 that office they go home and that is the last they think of it </seg>
         <seg id="p099">j Nebraska Association of Fair Managers They say, '(We have got a good president and a good secretary, let them do it". Gentlemen, that is a physical impossibility; and you Know it is; they have tot to have that old teamwork again, and they can't do it by the president and secretary alone and you know it; and Perry Reed hasn't hiret me to say this either.T am saying it because I mean it. No man has ever lived in the State of Nebraska that understands Fairs better than Perry Reed; no man has ever given more time to the State Fair to mike it a success. I am in the habit of looking on the bright side of everything else but gentlemen, we have got to the point where there is no bright side,' we have got to get action or we will have no County Fairs and no State. Fair; we will have a street Fair or a commercial Fair, like they have had in the State this year. For example, almost within the sound of my . voice, and one of their officers sits here now 1 stening to me, he will know it is a fact, I know, he isn't saying anything and 1 am not going to name those Fairs, but they are almost jwithin the sound of my voice. One of the most prosperous Fairs we had several years ago, a certain element got control there and they made a street Fair out of it, and had a pumpkin in one window and a watermelon in another; and I understand our. parimutuel paid them the money, because they say every County drew that parimutuel money except York County, and this wasn't York County. I know we have to qualify to draw this money as a County Fair, having three day Fair and so forth, paying out premiums and so forth, but they evidently got that money. I was to another County Fair, attended it, a Fair that was close to my'own, (and I went to the secretary's office and there sat the presi - dent and secretary at the table in deep conversation 'with gloom spread all over their faces. When I came in they got up and shook hands with me, and I said, "what's the matter, you ought to have smiles all over your faces | with people pouring into the gates like they are now." They said, "You don't understand what it's all about." I said, "What is it all about?" They said, "A bunch of business men just canie down here and bought a big block of membership tickets." I said, "That should makVyou smile." They said, "Yes, that is getting control of this Fair until they can move it up town for commercial purposes." I couldn't believe it, they said, "Go up and talk to the business men, they will tell you." So I went up and had a conversation with the business men, and I found that was so. I said, why don't you hold your street Fair at sbme other time; that is all right, have a street Fair, but have it at some other time." They said, "We believe we can carry the expenses by drawing this money from the parimutuel.' I said, "You can't do it according to law." They said, "If that is a fact that law was made by man, andit can be changed by man, and we know how to change it." This fall when you vote on your State Senator, ask him if he is heartily </seg>

I'm going to cut this talk pretty short. I am going to say in closing that I have a motto that I would like to leave with you, and I would like to have you make it a part of your life, put it before you every day; if you do there will be no question about the Stale Fair being a success; live it, eat it and practice it every day, put it on your barn and on your house. That motto is, "united success is sure, divided and failure is sure." Now, gentlemen, it is up to you and me, and which are we going to make it. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Mr. Hastings, it certainly has done me good to listen to your remarks. We surely thank you. Gentlemen, it is early; yet we have such an interesting program for the evening that lam wondering if it would not'be best now to close for this afternoon and come back this evening. I again want to call your attention to the banquet ticket com - mittee. They are: Chet Marshall. Chairman, Bert Miller, E. R. Pur - cell. E. .1. Miille. J. F. Shubert. H. F. Kuhl, G. C. Hueftle, and R. R. \ance. Those of you who have not registered should go up on the mezzanine floor and get your name on the docket and get your badges. MR. CL'M.EX: Mr. Hastings spoke about some County Fair getting a share of the parimutuel money when perhaps they were not entitled to it. Now. that is the thing that we have been trying to work out for three years. We started out and asked the County Clerks to qualify the Fair, and we found that some County Clerks qualified some Fans that weren't entitled to it. Then while we were threshing around trying to find something I called the president and talked to him about asking for an affidavit from the secretary or some officer stating that they had held a Fair at a certain time, in fact I wrote him about that; then we had letters from him suggesting that we have in the affidavit the amount of money which is paid for pre - miums. Now, we followed his suggestion, and that is the affidavit we have asked for from Counties. Some counties that came out for instance, we had one county that showed $11.00 of premiums, so we wrote back to tell them that they did not qualify and they wrote us and said that $11.00 they had paid on last year's premiums and they didn t have any money to pay on this year's, however, they had agreed to pay so much in premiums. Now, I asked the president to discuss at this meeting some way of arriving at the qualification, of a Fair, and I have some blanks with me which I intend to show </seg>
         <seg id="p101">Nebraska Association of Faib Managers him and get his slant on. If that Fair only had one pumpkin and one watermelon on display and didn't have any premiums anyway, we had an affidavit that they paid so much in premiums. A DELEGATE: Could I ask you a question? ! MR. CULLEN: Yes sir. THE DELEGATE: I read in the Lincoln Journal or Lincoln Star that you paid that to every County in the State except York County. MR. CULLEN: Yes. . . ' THE DELEGATE: Did you pay this two hundred and eighty nine or seven dollars to every county in the State? .' ; MR. CULLEN: Yes sir. THE DELEGATE: Then there are ninety-two counties holding Fairs. MR. CULLEN: No sir; I think there are 81 County Fairs and eleven 4H shows. THE DELEGATE: And these other Fairs qualified on the same blank you sent me? MR. CULLEN: Yes sir. THE DELEGATE: And I sent it right back to you. MR. CULLEN: Yes sir. THE DELEGATE: And I got a letter from you, or somebody else down here, that you couldn't pay until the first of November. MR. CULLEN: The reason we couldn't pay—we, have this money most of this money that we send out comes from the Ak-Sar-Ben' receipts, and we get that money in July, and we would like to get rid of it because it is just a matter bf extra bookkeeping for us to carry that thing from July to November. Now, until last year we estimated about what we could send out and sent out.two hundred and seventy - five dollars, then sent the rest of it later on; that just makes double work; so ll we could arrive at some plan whereby we could get thes - counties qualified early we would like to get rid of that money i us t as fast as we could. THE rJELEGATE: I don't question now, the way you sent out the money, because it came in awful handy to us when it did come out The way I understand that law. the qualification is that it must be paid for stock premiums in 4-H shows or Fairs, but they must show stock. The argument to the legislature and I believe it is the law was that it was to be paid out to build up the stock of the State of Nebraska; that is the reason they wanted this parimutuel betting money </seg>
         <seg id="p102">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Now, if these people go and take it up town and get this money by showing a few exhibits and cutting the main things of the Fair out, then this parimutuel is a failure; it is not getting what the people voted to get. Now, if they are going to commercialize it, and it is simply commercializing it for some certain towns the way these fellows work it when they can go in and buy a big block of member - ship tickets and elect their own officers and move it up town. Can't you watch them? MR. CULLEN: The law specifically says that this money must be paid out for agricultural or livestock premiums, you can't use it for anything else, and we have considerable correspondence on that. Now, we are insisting on the 4-H shows being eligible; we are vitally interested in 4-H stuff, and we think where they do not have the Fair the -l-H club members should have a place to show their stock. We have counties out in the State, for instance Banner, that wrote in a couple of years ago to find out about how much we were going to send out so they could know how much to put in the premium list, because they don't have any assistance from the County, all they have is this money. A DELEGATE: May I interrupt just a second? MR. CULLEN: Yes sir. THE DELEGATE: It seems to me that on this parimutuel money the obligation should not be placed on the Racing Commission to go after these Fairs you claim are taking this money unjustly. It seems to me it might be a good plan for the Racing secretary to turn these reports over to a committee and let it check these things over and go after the fellows who are unlawfully getting money. I don't think that obligation should fall on the Racing Commission. MR. HASTINGS: That is my point of view. If they answer those questions you are living up to the law. MR. CULLEN: Yes. MR. HASTINGS: I believe like this; the other Fairs interested have got to check up on these people, and if they have fooled you see that they aren't paid again. Of course, if they fooled you the money is gone and can't be recovered; but it is the work of the Associations to see that it don't go any more to commercialize some town. We are an agricultural state, nothing else, and these Fairs are organized to build up the agriculture of the state, and the parimutuel is doing a good job in helping build them up. MR. CULLEN: If they don't use the money for what they say they are using it for, they are violating their oath. </seg>
         <seg id="p103">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers We would like to have any ideas that you could give us on this matter, and maybe we could figure out some way whereby we could get at it. In the past I know we paid one County that wasn't entitled to it; however, I had an affidavit from the County Clerk that they were entitled to it.

I have had a number of requests for information since the meet - ing this afternoon on this problem of how to get all you can from your County Board for the assistance of County Fairs; what you are entitled to; how much you can get; and what you can do with what you do get. I would like to have a discussion from the floor here on it,| and if there are any questions I can answer I will be glad to do it. I don't have any statutes here with me, but I did pay a great deal of attention to this matter while County Attorney; in fact my association with the Fair Board at-Seward is due to the fact that while I was County Attorney we saw to-^n?|that the County Fair Board got everything that was coming to it. So I will try to answer what questions T can. If there is anybody that has any particular questions in that respect I would be glad to have them rise and ask them. Maybe some of you fellows get along fine with your County Boards, and; we would like to know how you do it. MR. VANCE, Adams County: We put on a PWA project on the Fair Grounds this summer, and we spent $6,200.80, and out of that we were to furnish $1,202.00. Now, I will tell you just a few of the things thatll got from our city free;.in other words, they hired me to be a professional beggar, that is the proposition that I had. In the first place the PWA furnished us 960 sacks of cement, we only bought 169 sacks to finish out, and here's some of the stuff we did on the Fair Grounds: </seg>
         <seg id="p104">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture We laid 13,140 cubic feet of cement in all. That went into a floor under the grandstand, we tore all the board flooring out and put in a good cement floor. We put in water pipes, and we put a cement floor in the big Agricultural Hall, and sidewalks over the grounds, and we hauled and placed in the buildings six hundred square yards of dirt; now, all of that I got free. Then we hauled in fourteen hundred square yards of dirt and placed it on the roads and in the grounds; this dirt was hauled by the City and others, and at twenty-five cents a load would have amounted to $350.00 And then we had the City haul us 700 square yards of sand at thirty-five cents per yard, that would be something like $240.00. Of course we had our own lumber, we used some thirty-five hundred feet of form lumber. Levelling 400 square yards of sand, twenty-five dollars- the Board of Supervisors did that free, they came in free with their tractors and spread that. There is a lot of little stuff that I won't mention, but I am just hitting some of the big ones. In all we spent just about $240.00 of actual money, and we got $6,000.80 worth of work and stuff furnished. Now, you want to know how we did this, I suppose. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Right. MR. VANCE: I don't know that I want this in the paper, because I am telling a story hero that I don't want to go back to Hastings. The way we do we worked one of our Board members onto the Council, that is the first thing w P did. After we got that done then we go and get one of the best Supervisors and get him on the Fair Board; then, you know you have got a pretty fair board and when they want anything, being a professional begger, they ask Vance to go down and meet the Council and tell them what they want, and we never fail to get it, boys, anything we ask for down there in reason we get. They gravelled all of our roads all over the Fair Grounds, hauled it up there free from 'the pit in the Blue, and hauled this dirt in free; they levelled the gravel, and anything we ask for we get. Now, if there are any questions I would like to answer them if I could; but that is about what we do down there. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Mr. Vance's idea of having a member of your City Council on your Fair Board is a honey. You can get considerable help from the very way Mr. Vance speaks of, that is absolutely true; some of your counties, however, are not as fortunate in having men like Mr. Vance that can go down there and put up a story that will get it. There is one member here tonight, the first time he has been here, the first time his County has been represented at one of our meetings. </seg>
         <seg id="p105">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers I would like to have Pete Whitescarver, representing Blame County, rise. Tell jus something about their problems, Pete. MR. WHITESCARVER:. Mr.. Chairman, we are out in Blame County; what we call the beginning of the sand hills. Our population, as far as the County is concerned, is 15,000. We are having what is commonly known as "a Heck of a time" getting any money from the County Commissioners for the Fair Association. 1 Mr. Doud here and myself have been with this organization practically since the origina - tion. At first we handled the affairs by subscription, then Mr. Doud got to be one of the Commissioners and he helped us get some money by taxation, but since then he's off the Commission. As Mr. Vance says, it's quite aj help to have a Councilman on the Fair Board to get some help at lots of places; I happen to be Chairman of the City Board there, but our finances are small, the town is small, and the County is small. ! The proposition of three and four day Fairs came up this after - noon. We have run at various times; we now run Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and it works good. We are in a position where we are trying to purchase some ground? to make a permanent grounds for the Fair Association, and We are backed by the.business houses of Dunning, and they sent the two of us down here to get all the information possible on how to obtain money from our own County Commissioners, these fellows don't seem to want to throw in with us for some reason or another. I have done a lot of corresponding with Mr. Chet Marshall, Perry Reed and Mr. Cullen, of the Parimutuel, and the results, are all right with this exception, we haven't got the money yet from the County Com - missioners. So far we haven't been paying very big dividends, but this year we have stirred up quite a lot of discussion among our farmer people. Our rates of premiums out there are small, because we don't have very much money to pay with, but when they noised around this year that the County Commissioners weren't giving a penny, and our report will show that we didn't receive anything whatever'from our County. Commissioners this year,! there developed quite an ill feeling betwfeen the people and the County Commissioners; and some of the people 1 that had never supported the County Fair before learned that and said, "You fellows go down to Lincoln and get all the legal information you can in regard to how we can get money from the County Commissioners for the Fair"; so that is what we are here for, to learn, how you other fellows obtain this money; we are wanting to build a permanent ground for a permanent association. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you, Pete. MR. A. H. MILLER, Washington County: We have an unusual situation up in Washington County. We have two associations", we </seg>
         <seg id="p106">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture have what we call the Washington County Association, and a holding association which owns the Fair Grounds proper, we have some forty acres. Then we have an Agricultural Society of which every man that buys a season ticket is a member. The holding association, which holds the grounds, constitutes some one or two hundred members—am I not light, Chet'.' MR. MARSHALL.- About a hundred individuals. MR. MILLER: Then tin- association from time to time has bought stock; thai is tv ay. that when we have had a surplus, say four or five thousand dollars, wi- have invested that in buildings and taken -tuck [or it. \\e have two associations, a holding association which owns thi' grounds, then we have the County association to which every - body belongs. U'lutl we are asking light now is that the association be - come the owner of lh.- .rounds, and in case we can get that thing through lli- , -a. pi... -. dii-i- then the society will own the grounds and we can gel Wi'A _ur„, which is quite plentiful up in that country, and v. iiii-li liny are idling i„ give us if the Fair Grounds belong to the pc..;.;.. Iili: ,f a holding association owns the grounds we can't gel a cent. The Cniiiny official,, up there have been very nice to us. We I.avc been gelling s_.wm.il.) a year: a while ago we got more, about S:i.liH&gt;.lil) &#132;, S:;.ii(),i.iMi. We have always had, I think—no, we haven't today, but practically all ihe lime we have had one member of the Board of Commissioners a- a member of our governing body, and as a result we have had wonderful cooperation; they have never refused us anything. But thai situation where we have got two societies kinda puts us up against it. and we are trying to get out from under that; we have tried to be patient, but it takes a long while, you know the wheels of justice grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine. Now, if we can get that W'PA work we need a lot of painting done, we are willing to buy the paint if the W'PA would put it on; and we are willing to buy lumber if the WPA will furnish the labor. We expect to in the future perhaps have the same situation as you have, but the first thing we want to do is work it so the people own the society, MR. HASTINGS: I would like to ask you a few questions. They have got me kinda mixed up. I believe, the way I get it, that they must appropriate so much, according to the size of the County and things. .Vow. in our County they must appropriate $2,000.00, and of course a larger County would appropriate more. I think they have a right to appropriate only so much money according to law, whether they want more than that or not. Here's what I want to ask you, and you can correct me if I am not right; they can make a levy of one - fourth mill to raise that money. In our County they now levy one-tenth </seg>
         <seg id="p107">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers of a mill; that will raise it if everybody pays their taxes, but you know during the past several years they haven't paid their taxes, so we get sixteen-eighteen hundred dollars a year. Is it a fact that up to $2,000.00 as fast as that money comes in afterwards the County owes the Fair Association that money? . PRESIDENT MATZKE: Yes sir. j MR. HASTINGS: That is what I wanted to know; and they have a right to force the County Commissioners to make that appropriation? : PRESIDENT MATZKE: Right. MR. HASTINGS: And another thing that was mentioned, about them assessing—taxing your corporation; I understand in 1935 we passed a law down here that any corporation incorporated without profit, likejthe Fair Association, is not taxable. We are incorporated, and we pay no taxes. That is what kinda gets me, because they are incorporated and pay taxes; now, is that right, or not? PRESIDENT MATZKE: The question of incorporation of an agricultural society is not under the regular corporate laws of our state, it comes .by] reason of a special statute providing for they incorporation of agricultural societies, and is not liable for taxes if it is properly incorporated. I want to suggest one idea here that Mr. Miller has brought to] my mind that might be of use to some of you fellows in that position. In Seward, we rent our Fair Grounds to the city of Seward forj a park by the year, we reserve the week for the Fair, outside of that week, the City pays us $300.00 a year for the use of it, and for any work we do the City signs as sponsor with the WPA. That) would get around the situation you mentioned. There has been so much discussion here on the legal phases of this. We don't have time to go into legal phases at all, but I want you to know that secretaries in our duly incorporated agricultural societies can go to tl c Attorney General, and he must give such opinions as are requested o: him. You have a right to him. However, nobody knows better than an old County Attorney how useless Attorney General's opinions ari. If you have a question that you want to put to the Attorney General on any phase of this from the legal end, if you will write out your question and send it to me I will be glad to frame it up so they can't sidestep it. However, I am not saying that about the present Attorney General, my experience has been in the past, and maybe that don't apply now. Sometimes the Attorney General refuses on close questions to take a definite stand, and on those things in which it is impossible to get an opinion, I will be glad to give you the benefit of such legal knowledge as I possess in answering questions. In Seward County we do not have a special levy for the Fair. Our County Board makes a lump levy for mother's pensions, agricul- </seg>
         <seg id="p108">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I tural societies, extension work—they have got about six things thpy lump right in together, and I think the amount for the County ;is about $25,000.00 that they just run in a lump, so we always get our $2,000.00 if we can show that we pay that much out in premium?, and since we have a free Fair, we can always show that. i Are there any other particular questions on this subject that you would like to have an attempt at answering here? If there isn't we will proceed along; but I want you fellows to know that if you have any questions you would like to have answered on legal propositions relative to these things that if you will drop a line to me stating your problem I will be glad to do my best to answer it or get an opinion from the Attorney General to help you out of your trouble. There are some show people that haven't been presented, and if they are here now 1 will introduce them. Is the representitive of the Ernie Young Shows here? (No response.) The Ernie Young Produc - tions are in Room 720. Is Melvin Bierman in the room? MR. BIERMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate this precious tune on your program this evening, and I would just like to tell you why I wasn't here this afternoon; you know the professors up at the University have a peculiar way of keeping a guy busy for three or four hours on what they call final examinations, and that is where I was this afternoon. But / would like to tell you that we have routines in riding, trick and fancy rope spinning, and so forth, and I would appreciate helping you with your Fair. I think that is about all I want to say this evening, except that I wish for you a bigger and better 1938 Fair. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Is there any other show people here now? Before we go on with the regular program we have another visitor with us tonight, and I want to call on her. Banner County is with US here, and I would like to call on Mrs. Kathryn Lee. of' Harrisburg, please. MRS. LEE: Mr. Chairman, I will say but a few words, because I feel that we are so new in the game, and we are needing a lot of in - formation; however, I have certainly been enjoying the discussions, and also the speakers. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Are there any other Counties that have never been here before that are represented here; if there are please rise. Any other counties? JOSEPH BALLWEG, Greeley County: I believe I will have to call on our president, he can make a better expression than I can; Mr. Lee. </seg>
         <seg id="p109">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers PRESIDENT MATZKE: Mr. Lee, could we have a few words from you? MR. EMMETT J. LEE, Greeley County: As. Chairman of the Board of Greeley County, I might say that several years ago we started a 4-H Calf Club along one cold evening in January. We had a defunct County Fair at that time. From that little 4-H meeting we have developed into a County Fair. The Fair was busted, as I said before, and jwe moved the county seat over into another town in the corner of the county. We have gotten an appropriation from the County for the last, seven years, and we have built a Fair Grounds, and we are in there pushing, and we certainly put out entertainment year after jyear. We use free acts, home talent, and it has been built around the young folks of your county. I think that is all 1 have to say: -. | ' ' ¦'; PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you very much, Mr. Lee. We are certainly glad to see these first-timers coming here taking part in our program and giving us the benefit of what they have learned and listen to what we have to say. Are there any others here? A DELEGATE: I have our president here, I would like to introduce him. Mr. John H. Wiese, of Sai'py County. MR. WIESE: I haven't much to say. This is my first year here and .my first year's experience with the County Fa*ir; although I have listened to some good discussions here/I can.tell you that. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Do we have any others? If there are none we will go along with our program here. Now, I don't know whether we are going to hear anything new - tonight or not; Mr. Sorrell informed us this afternoon that he had practically given us his speech, but we have him on the program. and have got to get it over with. I am sure from the inklings given-, this afternoon that we are going to have an interesting paper. We are - happy that he has been able to come up here from Otoe County and; give us this. I introduce at this time J. F. Sorrell, of Syracuse. MR. SORRELL: Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great deal' of pleasure to appear here this. evening. This program consists of two particular phases. The County Fair in our agricultural progi-am is a deep subject to try to talk on, and I am riot going to keep you gentlemen waiting here very long, because! I realize that possibly some-: of you young fellows have got dates and some of you. older fellows-, want to go to the show, so T don't want to bore you and I am not going to be guilty of that here this evening. However, I do want to say here in the beginning that I feel at home; I am now in the auction business and real estate and insurance business, but until eight years ago I was actually engaged in farming. I moved from the farm </seg>
         <seg id="p110">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture at that time and since have lived in Syracuse. I have lived in Otoe County ever since I moved up here, and have learned to love that County, learned to love all the folks in that County, our State Uni - versity, I have learned to love the State Agricultural Department, and I have just about made up my mind that the agricultural people are just about the finest group that I have ever heard of, read of or want to read of. We will take the two phases of the County Fair in our agricultural program and classify (hem like this; the necessity of a County Fair connected with our agricultural program, then we will next take the de - velopment of the County Fairs. First we will go back and notice the time that the State Legislature figured that it was very essential that we have laws permitting a group of agricultural people and ¦ aimers to hold a County Fair. Possibly they weren't dirt farmers, we have a great many legislators that are professional men. Some of them are doctors, some of them are lawyers, I have known ministers to be elected to the legislature, but nevertheless if they are from Ne - braska they think- agriculture, they sleep it, they eat it, they drink!it, ami they talk it, because that | s what kind of a country we are living m, it is a purely agricultural country. So, when you live in the middle west out here you are more or less familiar with the agricultural problems. I don't think there is any professional group of men, lawyers, doctors, ministers—it matters not what profession they profess, that don't think- favorably of the agricultural interests. In the first place it is the bread basket of our entire nation, why shouldn't they think fa - vorably of it; sometimes the only enemy that we have is ourselves, sometimes we injure our health by eating too much, sometimes there are folks that injure their health by not eating enough, we can say the same things of drinking—we will not say what kind of drinks, but it is true. I could mention several different things in that regard,' and you can see the point, but here is the main point; in the beginning our forefathers, the men that laid the foundation of this agricultural country that we live in today and that we are proud of, the men that contributed many hours and many dollars to help build our universities, our agricultural departments in our universities, they saw the need of agricultural developments, and one of the finest ways to develop a keen interest on a farm—we will start down with Jim Jones' farm, is for that man to be blessed with finances enough so that he can buy himself a good brood sow, a good mare, or a good milk cow, or a good stock cow that has got a pedigree, that is registered; he feels a little prouder of that animal than he does if he has a scrub cow— a grade cow, because there is something attached that creates a special interest. The same thing holds true when you have especially fine stock; at least they are as good as you think there is in the county, or in the community that you are living in, and there is something about the interest there that makes you want to take them to the </seg>
         <seg id="p111">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers County Fair, and you take them right on down to the County Fair. There are a great many people that will visit that County Fair that didn't know that Jim Jones owned that kind of livestock. The real point in this is that by bringing your exhibits out before the public you haven't only won first prize—we will, say that you have taken the blue ribbon, and you were paid a cash prize, you benefited maybe and maybe not, it may have cost you all that you get out of it/but you have helped develop a better interest' in—livestock, we are talking about now, and some feUow will come along and say, "How much do you sell those fine male hogs for, how much are you asking for them; how much are you asking for those fine calves, how much are you asking for those heifer calves?" Well, he sets, his price, and after he's got the blue ribbon on them, if he's won the blue ribbon, you can't set it too high lots of times. So you have got a chance there to benefit yourself in making your sale if not in the cash prize that you won; the man that buys from you has benefited himself, be - cause he is started into breeding the kind of livestock that will pay him better dividends, it always pays to do the better things. So, you see, when you are talking of livestock, you have benefited yourself, you have benefited the fellow that is going to be benefited by your becoming interested in the very thing that you have become in - terested in. All right, we will concede that that is a point for the betterment of agricultural interests. Now, hoiv does it help the County Fair? Well, there is a certain spirit of enthusiasm that goes with a crowd, and they will go to the Fair, and they will go home; maybe it will be the next week, maybe it will be the' next month, but neighbor will tell neighbor, "Why, say, I didn't know that they was having that kind of a Fair down there. I didn't know that we had that kind of livestock and that kind of grain. I didn't know we were raising this,, or they were producing that in this county; that is the first time I knew,anything about it", and by that means you create an interest, that will, in the end, as it runs along, not only in the end but as it goes along year after year, do the finest type of good to any com - munity that that exists in. .So, we will give that point to the County Fair/or the State Fair, so there is one way and a fine way that we can help the agricultural problem of today, by holding our County Fair. That inducement doesn't die as soon as they go home, that inspiration that they got at the County Fair is lasting, there is something about it that makes it lasting, where if you never got out and mixed with the people that come to the County Fair, and if your neighbor didn't speak up. to you and say, "Congratulations, Jim, on your fine showing," you wouldn't feel half so good about it either; you wouldn't try half so hard next year, you wouldn't use the curry comb near as much, you wouldn't hajil near as much straw in from the straw pile for bedding, you wouldn't do yourself near as much good if you hadn't learned that </seg>
         <seg id="p112">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture pride, that self interest and that self pride and a love to have things better; and that same comparison holds true to com, to wheat and to all sorts of grass feed and grain and so forth. All right, I could stand here and make those kind of comparisons until you would be tired of hearing them, but time doesn't permit, so 1 am going to transfer right over to the human body from livestock and show you another reason why the County Fairs are of great interest to our agricultural program of today. In order! to have a good agricultural program we must have good people to execute it; and today we have our farm bureau agencies, we have all the state as - sistance, we have some of the finest broad-minded legislators today that know from where we live, and they have cultivated the keenest finest interest in our 4-H Club work today that could ever be demon - strated in the length of time that it has had to develop. Today just as soon as the young fellow is old enouph he knows that he can buy him a calf and start in feeding him, and he is tickled to death if daddy has got the money to help him buy a calf. And there are several of us daddies that didn't have the money this fall to buy sonny-boy or sister-girl a calf, and I want to tell you what we did. We financed them ourselves, and we have about fifty 4-H Club calves down in Otoe County today. There is one thing that has helped that a great, and that is that the price of grain isn't prohibitive now like it was twelve months or so ago, -&#132; we feel a little bit more gracious, we feel a little bit more speculative for the boy and girl that belongs to these clubs: we feel that they have got a chance to learn a good lesson in feeding cattle, and we want them to have that Jesson; and if it wasn't for the fact facing them that they were going to get to take that calf down to the County Fair the 30th and 31st day of August and the Ist of September and come in to direct competition with Buddy over here on the next section, or Sister over here on the next sec - tion, they wouldn't be nearly so interested as they are. We are directly in the middle of the finest business in the world when we are sponsoring these kinds of interests; and the County Fair and the State Fair and our agricultural interests from the very lowest and the most humble organization in any state in the Union up to the highest in the United States Department of Agriculture today will give those propositions and those people the finest and best cooperation than can possibly be given them, you can rest assured; just as our fine President told you men here this afternoon, if there are any problems that he can help you with, as an attorney, in the way of benefiting you or your County Fairs, feel free to ask, because he feels the urge; so it is with every interest in the United States today. We have several conflicting ideas in the method and the pro - cedure that they think should be followed, but all we have to do, gentlemen, is to stay in the buggy; you have got something coming, and if you will stay in there and ride they are going to get it. Of </seg>
         <seg id="p113">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers course, as Vlr. Hastings told you, you will never get it, you will never have a gotd County Fair if you don't go out and sponsor the things that help build a good County Fair. And let me tell you one thing fur - ther, if youido have a good County Fair it isn't only going to help make a good State Fair—some people think that is the idea of the County Fair. As secretary of our Fair Association down in Otoe County I really can't afford to drive the hundreds of miles that I do for the interests of the Otoe County Fair, I can't afford to put in the time that I do. I| have two youngsters in college here in Lincoln myself, and I have anqther that is going to be ready for college next year, but they are just as much interested in dad's problems as dad is himself; and so will all youngsters be the same way if you will start in with them soon /enough. Of course there are some exceptions, but farmers or business men, if you take the young and start teaching them the fundamentals that will do them good, and talk to them about a County Fan-, about agricultural programs, about a 4-H Club of any kind, whether it be a nig club, a sheep club, a calf club, it matters not, you are really doing something that will live on and on for ages. We are jusf; merely making a dent in that now.. And you take the 4-H Health Club;.what could be finer. Certainly if Jim Jones is interested in winning a blue ribbon on his big team of geldings or big fine team of Percherpn mares, his herd of cattle, shorthorn, roan, black, any kind, father and mother like to see their children scored—like to know how near Buddy or Sister scores perfect. There is another fine thing about the County Fair, and it fits in directly with the agricultural program, the school, the town. In our county we have the finest cooperation in the world with riie Otoe County Medical Association. They come up there and-score those babies. As I have told you, I was dividing this talk into two phases; the necessity part of the County Fair in connection with our agricultural program, and now the development. !'./'" 7 Now, as to the development of Fairs, here's some of the first things that must be done in order to develop a County Fair. As our President said, they just about took that part of the story away from me this aftej-noon, but nevertheless I am going to mention a few thing 3. I have thought and lived, this for three or four years, so I really don't have to take down notes when I come to talking about agriculture. It was necessary for all these things, our forefathers could even see that; our legislature followed right on up, they could see it was necessary, but they haven't told us exactly how to develop because the same method doesn't always apply to all counties, to all Fairs and to all towns. ,-.)';:- !.-!/ ¦ Now, I am going to speak for our own county, and you fellows can surmise from the statements that I make how we developed down there, how we have developed, how you may develop if you haven't </seg>
         <seg id="p114">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture already done so. There are a lot of fellows here that are presidents and secretaries of some of the finest Fairs that anyone could ask for considering the trials and tribulations and temptations that we have gone through within the last five years. The Nebraska men and women are the kind that don't die with their chin on their chest—they -lie with their boots „n when it comes to fighting for agricultural interests, and then- head right up in the air. And to develop a Fail - that is one thing you must have first. You must have that old spirit stirred right into you, ground into you, to never say die. Don't say we can't do it. don't say, "our County Commissioners are not favorable." Do the iies;l best thing, and you will get it done, because when anything is /',„• the best you may not succeed when you first try, out the old story says try and try again if you don't succeed at first.' So. that is !he determination of a body of men that have organized lhemselve together ,„,o „ Fair Association. They must have it. To start with «,- must say.

It is all right when conditions arc right, but that is too uncertain. Also, to begin with, it is necessary as soon as possible tor you to own your own grounds, as soon as you own your ground it is necessary to get the most convenient "buildings possible so that it doesn't matter if it rains or the sun shines. We have set that week aside to, in one sense of the word, cele - brate; to have a good time, to enjoy the fruits of the harvest that has 3 ust gone by, and to think and speculate on the future that is still to come. Down in our County we started out with a 4-H Club organization. Our County Fair had no funds, so we immediately had a right then to petition the County Commissioners for funds to pay premiums or pay premiums with, and we started holding a three day free Fair </seg>
         <seg id="p115">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers down there. We were very proud of the showing we were making in the 4-H line, so the nert thing was to get some place for those boys to house their club animals and the poultry and the fancy work and everything like that in. The first building we got was a little shed, just a shed with posts on the sides and grooved roofing boards for a roof. We all chipped in and donated the labor, and all we were out was the cost of material.' Well, soon after that the business men down at Syracuse figured it would be a fine thing to start a community sale down there, and in order to help one an - other:—there comes that old spirit of cooperation, the Fair Association agreed to go in and—mind you not buy, just go in and contract to buy six lots, just city lots there forty four feet wide by one hundred and fifty feet long, and the Community Sale Association would buy the same number likewise. Of course the Community Sale soon started building a nice community sale barn, and we entered into an agree - ment with the Community Sale Association that we were to rent that nice big building three days out of each year to hold our Fair. Well, we thought we were getting somewhere, which we were. / A year or so later we got the idea that we would be putting up tents, and one time in particular we had a terrible rainstorm and a terrible windstorm. We had the 4-H colts and ponies in a big tent, the grounds were low and the rain went in under. The poor kiddies, it would just make your heart bleed to go in there and see those colts and ponies those 4-H club kiddies had cleaned and shined, and they were so discouraged because we didn't have any better facili - ties there to get along with; that we didn't have any better accommoda - tions. Well, they weren't any more disgusted than we were; but did we get discouraged, did we say, "the whole thing isn't worth the effort?" No, we just buckled up our belts and started in k little more determined than before. So here two or three years ago I was one of the boys that got the idea that we might get WPA help, so we made applica - tion, but we weren't lined up just exactly right, like brother Miller said they wa-en't. So I called a meeting of the board and said "Listen, gentlemen, I believe that. I have enough men interested in the agri - cultural interests and betterment of our County Fair right here in this town that I can go out to them personally and borrow. ss,ooo.oo, and we will put jup an Agricultural Hall down there on the grounds to display our,fancy work in, to display our agricultural exhibits in,,and in fact most jany kind of exhibits that we have to display down there, and at the same time we will fix it so that we can have our displays and our commercial booths there. We will sell those commercial booths to business men for advertisement purposes." And it worked fine. I went to five men that I thought I could borrow ?1,000.00 apiece from. I told them the situation, I said, as secretary of the Fair Association, "You men are located right here. We have got along with this sale pavilion, but I think we are just started, if you men will loan our Fair </seg>
         <seg id="p116">Report ok Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Association $5,000.00 I will go before our County Commissioners and ask them if they will be willing to make this levy that the law says they may make, it doesn't say they 'shall' like pertaining to the other laws, it says they 'may' make it." Well, they promised me in the presence of these men that had promised to loan the money that they would allow that levy. We took the $5,000.00 and built an Agri - cultural Hall right down there on our own little Fair Grounds, that we were already in debt for. So we have taken' this $5,000.00, put up he building, paid the men that we owed for the lots, and that happened two years ago. Today we only owe $1,500.00 or $2,000.00 of the $5 000 00 and we have got a building there that the people were just amazed to see in a little town like Syracuse. ' ' Now, this last year it seemed necessary that we have a place to exhibit our horses in the open class. There is another thing that has helped to develop our County Fair to a great degree. We found out that Jim Jones wasn't just exactly satisfied to see Sonny win blue ribbons and red ribbons, he wanted to win one on his Percheon team of mares, o,- his gilts, or his fine stallion, or his open class milk cows or stock cows; so we felt the urge to offer premiums in the open class. All ,-ight. we did that. What was the result? We run out of buildings again; and this last year we built a nice little horse barn And I want to tell you how we got it built. They said when I put it up to the Board "yes, Frank" they said, "you seem to have got along with the other all right, now if you think you can get that horse barn go right along." I went out where I knew they had taken down an old silo and-got some of the finest dimension lumber in the world, and we built a horse barn. I got all the labor donated, and I happened to know a man who was going to excavate under his house there m Syracuse, so I went to him and said, "Mr. Joyce, as long as you are gomg to excavate under your house, we need the dirt, won't you make an effort to do that at the same time we build the horse barn so we could nil it in so water won't run in?" And he says, "Say, Frank, I will go see my contractor, and if I can arrange it with him, I will be only too glad to do it." And he hauled fifty loads of dirt in there, and it would have cost us $2.00 a load at the very least to have hired it hauled, and he did ,t for nothing. That is cooperation, that is development, gentle - men And I could go right along telling you of such matters, but it sounds like bragging on myself and the Otoe County Fair is the reason I am not going to go on talking about such things any more. But I am going to mention one more thing on the way of developing a County Fair, and that is this : Whenever you advertise your Fair-you know the old slogan "It pays to advertise", and it just does; so get your program all lined up and get it on your bills. We are proud of the Fair, and we are telling the whole wide world about it. It doesn't make any difference </seg>
         <seg id="p117">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers whether it is a State Fair, County Show, or County Fair; when you start advertising, do it in detail, don't just say you are going to have a County Fair and take it for granted that everybody knows what you are going to have and that everybody will come because it is held at Syracuse,: or somewhere else,, because that rule doesn't work. We have found that out, so we. advertise this way; we put out big patriotic Fair bills, all colored up in patriotic colors. We have been holding lour Fair Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday; we allow them to bring in then - exhibits Monday afternoon and up until ten o'clock on Tuesday. At ten o'clock on Tuesday, we start judging. We advertise the first day as exhibition .day. The last two years we have put on a horse show down there in our lighted park—we have a park that is air lit up with flood lights, and we put on a horse show that will cost you fifty or seventy five cents to see elsewhere. We advertise Otoe County's free Fair, Otoe Couny'sfree Horse Show, and there's a little psy - chology; if ydu don't think so just "watch other people whenever they see something that is free, that is what causes them to crash the gate down; and on the first night of our Fair the last two years we have tried to make a check on the number of people that filed in and out of that park to see that horse show free, and it's been around 5,000 people. On the second day in order to get them to come in and in order to get a crowd in we developed what we call a "Little Miss Otoe County" contest, and if you don't believe daddy and mother get quite a thrill from seeing their youngsters parade up there on the stage, try it. So at two o'clock we have the selection of Little Miss Otoe County, who was to ride on the County Fair float the last day in the parade. Well, we just packed that park right after noon that second day, and of course they even had ball games under the flood lights, and so forth. JThen the third day we advertised as parade day. Before we did that the third day was merely the day that everybody had just gone home and taken their exhibits somewhere else, but not so last year, as near) as we could check up on it there was around 10,000 people that crowded into that little town of Syracuse to see that parade. And here's how we developed that section of our County Fair. Our good/brother here from Hastings said that he was the official beggar) at Hastings; I happen to be the official beggar down at Syracuse. jWe have something like a hundred business men in the town, and I walked up and down main street and said, "Gentlemen, we would like to put on a parade here the last day of the County Fair. We think it would be an asset to the County, our town, and would even be an asset to the State Fair." And, bless your sweet life, Mr. Banning, President; of the State Fair; invited us to bring those floats up here to take part in our State Fair parade, and we were happy tc get the opportunity and came up. Here is the co - operation that made it possible for us to build all those fine floats; they cost us anywhere from $85.00 up to $125.00 apiece. We got a </seg>
         <seg id="p118">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture decorator from down at St. Joseph, Missouri; got him to come up and he built these floats, and he can decorate them beautifully, now, and it was a thrill to merely stand and watch them drive by; you could just feel that old spirit of cooperation and enthusiasm, and everything else, all at the same time. Now, we have several druggists there, and they all chipped in and put their own advertisement on the side of one of those floats: "The Druggists of Syracuse, Nebraska"; and don't think they weren't proud when it marched down main street. All right, the different business men in Syracuse grouped themselves together and it didn't cost any of them over $7.50 apiece, the finest type of advertising they ever paid for in their lives, and it was the finest crowd drawer we ever had in our life there. -Now, in the place of just having a two day Fair we have developed that Fair so that we have three days literally chuck full of good feeling, and everybody goes. Last year I thought it couldn't be any better, but doggone if I don't think it was better this year than last year. We have several things that 1 could point out to you that have taken place down there. Mr. Banning has told me several times, "Frank, I don't know whether you ought to fool around with pari - mutuels or not, I think you better leave it alone." Even the Chair - man of the Racing Commission told me that this afternoon. But that isn't my idea, and it isn't the Otoe County Agricultural Asso - ciation's idea; we want to grow, we wouldn't care if we got as big as the State Fair, we would be proud of it; and there is only one thing that makes us feel that way, and that is that feeling that we had when we started out with our 4-H Club and our County- Fair; and if you have those necessary qualifications to begin with the County Fair certainly will be an asset to our agricultural program today. I thank you one and all. PRESIDENT MATZKE: I thank you, Mr. Sorrell, not only for the splendid ideas, but the enthusiasm with which you have brought them. I think each each secretary here would do well to catch some of the enthusiasm Mr. Sorrell has brought to us. I want to announce that Lew Rosenthal is in Room 700; the Lew Rosenthal Enterprises. I believe there is another person that wants to be introduced; Ethel Robinson.

PRESIDENT MATZKE: We are now getting down to the ques - tion that caused so much interest this afternoon, and we are especially fortunate it having a man who has had experience along the lines of racing h County Fairs. I am mighty happy to introduce Adolph Wenke, of Stanton, who will talk to you on "Building a Race Pro - gram for a County Fair." Mr. Wenke. ¦"•/.'¦• ! MR. WENKE: Mr. President, members of the Fair Managers, visitors and friends. I have bach interested in racing for forty-three years, but !what I have to s&amp;y probably will not take very long. I do not talk building a race program for the County Fair on the theory Jthat it is the solution to anybody's problems, or that I feel it is the kind of a program that a Fair should have, nor! that it is adaptible to every community, nor that your Fair is so situated that it can (keep up a race program, nor that the sentiment in |your community is in favor of a race program. I speak only from my experience in connection with racing and observing it in the neigh - boring Fairs or Race Meets, the crowds, the effects upon the crowds, and its financial results. There has been some discussion of, racing this afternoon, and remarks by those! present as to what has come up for discussion that are not familiar to me. I always presumed, like our local Fair in a small county of 7,800, that you all have problems, but after I have listened here this evening to the dis - cussion and (talks I wonder if my presumption is true, because based on those remarks those gentlemen had better stay with the pro - grams they! have and not attempt to deviate, because if you have a Fair and have a successful program my advice is to stay with it unless you can add to it a Fair program. As T have experienced it, it is not a simple thing, and especially during the last six years or seven in our community it has been a real chore to make the pro- </seg>
         <seg id="p120">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture gram. We have made the financial outlay so that at the end of the Fair we are somewhere near even in regard to expenses and income, we run strictly up against that proposition when due to drouth and other conditions the attendance at our Fair decreases. We could not hope in a county of our size, as many of you cannot hope in counties from which you come, to compete "with the next larger counties in the type of program or the amount thereof -Neither can County Fairs compete with State Fairs, and we mil. all meet the problems that confront us in regard to our local a«- 0 -nations. As I have said before, what 1 say here is strictly in a non - partisan attitude, entirely based upon some of the observations I have made ami given to you with the thought that perhaps some Place , n this discussion I can leave some ideas irr this connection, that ,1 you have a race program might be of a little value to you. Race programs naturally develop themselves into two kinds local rare programs. &#132;,- as 1 term them, professional programs Local race programs necessarily terminate themselves in a short time The interest in horses locally has decreased materially, the amount of horses available for that purpose in our community, and I believe generally, has gone down so that in a year or two the winners are determined, and there is no more interest in your races. You will hnd in a year or two that the same horses or the same owners win the races, and you cannot put on local races as to make the con - testants even, and consequently your program, from mv experience becomes very one-sided and uninteresting at the most. What I have' to say ,s Erected to professional racing, and on that type of racing commonly known as running races. I believe though that it is paramount if you have a race program that you keep definitely in mind that you are still running a Cot.ntv Fair, and that you do not let it develop into a member of .some race association. Primarily, as I understand this organization, il is composed of managers of County Fairs organize.! under State laws or agricultural societies. It is easy to see that in connection with' parimutuel racing, and the national association connected with it that unless you are extremely careful you can develop your local County Fan- or agricultural society into a race meet. That I do not feci is advisable. do. however, feel that for the benefit of the association that ,t would be advisable that more than one association join them - selves together for the purpose of attempting to create entertain - ment of a like kind, in order to hold out an inducement to race horse owners to come to your association at reasonable prices. It is necessary to see that in connection with a County Fair race meet that horse men do not have to transport their horses over </seg>
         <seg id="p121">¦j Nebraska Association of Fair Managers long distances; which necessitates considerable added expense which must necessarily be borne by the purses in order for sufficient horses to come to your meet to hold a good race meet. Likewise I don't believe the j smaller associations need attempt to compete in purses with larger I associations, or with larger race meets. A meet such as Madison : cannot hope to compete with the Ak-Sar-Ben; neither Can the Ak-Sar-Ben hope to compete with the Kentucky Derby. So I say you should associate together Fairs of similar size who can somewhere near make the same purses available to horses. How - ever, if those horses competed in other cities, or other race meets, I think that is very necessary to get enough horsemen to come to your race meets. Likewise Ido not think it is Ifair for the larger associations, or larger places where they hold races to at the same time, or nearly the same time, hold their race meets and give con - siderably larger purses than those of a neighboring association. I feel that associations that can do that should go together and have their race meets separate. It has always impressed me, as I watch horses run, that it doesn't make any difference how fast they run as long as the race is even, and I have watched them from the Kentucky Derby down. Outside of the color of the meets, the color of the race as it is dressed up and presented to us, the horses run around the track, and I don't believe the average man can tell you much about the rate of speed or the time made by the horses. Your horses must be run so that horses of like ability get together in the races. If you have a race meet and feel it to be advantageous to your local society; the question immediately develops itself as to whether or not you want parimutuel betting. You will find many members of your association mighty opposed because while it is legalized there are still many people in Nebraska that feel it is an imposition on the public, and if it is placed available to the public it should be in some place where it doesn't confront every person who comes to the grounds, because you are holding a race meet in connection with a Fair./We conducted a race meet at our small Fair for three years prior to the time the parimutuel was legalized. We had just as many horses, possibly more, and. just as much attention from the public and possibly more than since that time; and I don't feel that a parimutuel is necessary in order to hold a race program. -¦'¦•¦' -| ' ¦' .-•¦ . '-¦: -•: '" : i '•",. ¦ ¦ However,; since it has been legalized we have had parimutuel, and I don't j feel it detracts in the slightest from our race meet. If you have, parimutuel there immediately comes up the problem of how to handle it. I feel that in larger meets it can be handled better by some one familiar with it; however, I have myself felt it can be handled by local men where the expense of supervised handling would be excessive. My only suggestion in connection with it is </seg>
         <seg id="p122">i Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture that you have a competent man handle it from the viewpoint of the mathematical calculations and quickness thereof; it is quite necessary if you have parimutuel betting that you pay off as quickly as possible, because a great many bettors use their money from one race to pay off in the next, and if that is not fast enough you lose a large part of the money. In order to keep that money circulating it is quite necessary to have fully capable hands to handle the funds m that connection. In that connection I make one more slight suggestion, that is this: you understand that in a meet you must pay off tw. twenty on each ticket. Unless the man in charge of the races has proper classifications and handicaps, and so arranges your races as to not put a top favorite in your race you will many times run up against a proposition where your betting loss is excessive, because if you have a top favorite that wins you must pay two-twenty ticket. Many have criUcised the two-twenty pay-off, and if you have an unbalanced race and the top favorite wins you will quite often lose money Too many people have the idea that the parimutuel can't be a loss to the association, but unless the horses are properly placed/ you may have considerable loss at the end of a day's program. If you would like to hold a race meet you must, of course, follow the statutory forms made necessary to permit you to have the race meet. In that connection, you must also give to the secretary, I be - lieve ,t ,s. of the Race Association, all the names of the officers that will be present and have supervision of your race program. In that connection I might say that it is very important, both to the betting public and the satisfaction of the Fair crowd to get as R-ood a starter as you can get. A poor starter can easily destroy a great deal of the satisfaction that a crowd gets out of your race If you beat one of the bettors, and he isn't given a fair start he immediately starts to criticize; if that happens race after race your Fair Crowd will likewise criticise. Likewise jockeys soon take ad - vantage and get off for flying starts, or pocket some horse that is good in the race, and you will get unsatisfactory starts. So I say to be very careful in the selection of your starters; get someone familiar with the starting business, and let him have the necessary men to help the slow horses get away to a good start. Secondly in that connection, it is well to get a good judge Usually you have some man who is somewhat familiar with races There are many technical points that come up that either may dis - qualify the race, the horse in the race, or because of the jockey's action may disqualify the jockey. That man should be competent to pass on the winning; he may decide who's to take the money from the parimutuel booths, consequently he should be familiar with the rules and regulations as to running, the jockeys, and so forth </seg>
         <seg id="p123">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers Next, I might say that it is very well to have a good saddle room man, someone you have confidence in, on the grounds. Often they will scratch horses at the last minute because they are clearly unfit for your saddle room rules. . You should also have a good man for the jockey room. He should know something about what they are doing in connection with their horses. In connection with the necessary publicity which you should give to your racing program in order to get the horses there, and I believe that sometimes proves to be a difficult question, which I believe would be somewhat solved by -. the grouping of race meets together through the associations. It is quite important that some kind of information be given to the owners of horses, and about the best way is to contact them at previous race meets; or, if you can find owners to send them literature in ample time, because they will not be at their permanent address, they are usually on the road but they leave a forwarding address. Put on your advertising matter the number of races that you expect to run and the kind of races that you expect to run, approximately the. size of the purses you expect to' give, the rules and regulations under which they are to run; and this particularly should be put on the bill/that all jockeys appear in uniform, because it adds to the appearance of the-race. You should advise them whether or not there will be stall rent, whether or not there will be an entrance fee, and also whether or not there will be parimutuel betting at your race meet. That is information that the horse owners are entitled to and should have. I might make a suggestion in connection with this, that you make your purses of such size that you can actually pay them. You can destroy the interest of horse owners in a racing meet quicker by fail - ing to pay them what you tell them you will pay than in any other manner. ,That is unfair to the horse owner, because he comes to the meet with tfie expectation that you.will give the number of races you advertise, will give the purses you advertise, subject to the rules and regulations, and at the end that if any of his horses have been winners 1 he's entitled to his pay-off. That, I think, is only fair to the men who, in consideration of the advertising you put out, have gone to the expense and trouble of coming to your race meets and providing you with the entertainment that you want. In connection with your daily program it becomes: very neces - sary that the individual that you pick out to prepare your daily program is a man familiar with horses, who knows somewhat of their record, of their previous winnings, of their platings in other meets, in that year; so that horses of comparatively the same ability will get into! the same race, if possible. You dothis by the length of the race, the weight of the handicaps, and similar things of that </seg>
         <seg id="p124">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture kind. If you have new horses at your meet you sometimes have difficulty the first day, and you may have top heavy favorites; but the man who you have in charge should make a careful survey of your first day's racing and of that horse's records, so that at least on the second, third and fourth day you are starting to get the horses properly handicapped and placed in the races where they belong. He should likewise realize that he is in charge of the racing; and unless he realizes that from the opening day he will soon find the horse men will run his racing. That is not for the best interests of the meet, because no man, no matter how many horses he has on the grounds, should have anything to do with the races, their kind, or qualifications, or purses; he should be entitled to place the horses as he sees best under the rules and regulations and the handicaps that you have made, but further than that he should have nothing to do with the racing itself. I merely call that to your attention because from experience both at home and elsewhere we have found that unless the man in charge of the racing is qualified and does have enough confidence in himself he will soon find out that this man and that man arc giving suggestions which he is following; other horse men soon find that out, and you have trouble making races, and the jockeys find out that they can take advantago of you. Racing, as I said, has a place on a Fair program if you have the facilities to handle it. With reference to our local Fair it has during the last six years, been financially successful; not in a lai'ge way. not something to boast or brag about, but it has carried the association as far as the expenses of running it and the program in the afternoon are concerned to a successful three day close. I do feel, in that connection, that in fairness to your horses that the average meet should not be of less than three days- it isn t fan- to the owners, you can't get proper classification' of you,- horses, and many other things in connection with the one or two day program would not be as satisfactory. Likewise if you hold longer meets I think that would be an inducement to the owners to come, and after all the racing depends upon the horses at your Fair; and again I say in that respect that it is not so necessary that you have such high class horses that you have to have high purses to give them, but that if you offer inducements to horse men so that those of the middle class will come you will have just as good a meet as they have at the top races. In closing this brief discourse I might say that I have dis - cussed entirely from the standpoint of building a program of racing. I realize that there are those of you in whose Fairs you have many in attendance who are not primarily interested in racing, and who do not come to your Fair solely for the purpose of seeing the races </seg>

In that respect, it is different from a race meet, or race meets under an association. You must give to the Fair itself that continuous agricultural program which we previously heard about, and you must likewise give to the people in the afternoon programs with your races, the necessary in-between races program that is necessary to entertain them. You understand in connection with parimutuel that you can't run one race im - mediately following the other. It is necessary that you have time to pay off jat the parimutuel. It is likewise necessary that the horses in the next race be prepared and brought to the paddock, and to give tho people in attendance that desire, an opportunity to bet on the pones after they see them in the paddocks; That demands some little time, twenty—twenty-five minutes in between runs in changing rices. That is probably one difficulty that many have in connection with racing programs.' There are certain things in con - nection with the Fair that can easily be brought into that program, such as exhibiting livestock, anything in connection with 4H or school work, or any exhibit upon the. grounds which is capable of being put bn in the track before your grandstand. However, you will find in connection with the program that those things'will be insufficient f you have a five or six race program every day, which I think would be a normal and average program to carry out; but the public ;xpects it, and you will have to provide some kind of interesting entertainment between races on the afternoon program. We have in a. great measure solved that by types of local entertain - ment, either in the form of contests, in the form of local exhibits/in the type of local home talent, or things of that nature, which are not necessarily very high priced. However, if you had a larger Fair, and your financial budget permits it, it would be an ideal place for such things jas free acts and things of that nature. However, in conjunction with the race program it is hardly necessary for me to dwell upon,the type of entertainment that could be put on between races, because the difference in the financial ability of your Fairs is so vast; where one might be able to spend a few hundred dollars for that purpose others might be able to spend a thousand or two, so what you will have there will depend a great deal upon your ability to buy. •'..¦'¦¦ .-¦. .../;.:".:...'.-..' In conclusion I will state that my observation' has been that generally in our community racing and parimutuel in connection with it is quite a job. However, we have Fairs in larger counties ad - joining us, such as West Point, who never thought of it, and who are much more successful than we are. It is not a cure-all, I don't recommend it where your program is successful; and I say if you go into it give it careful thought so that you don't jump into it because you think it will take care of all of your ills. But I do say that in instances I believe it is advantageous and advisable if well </seg>

My main reason for coming down today was to greet the mem - bers of the ; Fair Associations, and to see if we Couldn't establish circuits, which would be for the best interests of the Fairs. We had that brought home to us very forcibly last summer. We had a fine bunch of horses to start with, but as soon as the circuit was broken up it was hard to get the. number of horses back together again to what we had in the early part of the year. If you can keep a continuous circuit you can keep a fine bunch of horses together and have better Fairs.- - If.there- is anybody interested in that proposition I would be glad.to go over it with them at Room 620; and I have certainly en - joyed being with you here this evening.

         <seg id="p131">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers MR. HASTINGS: I don't believe they should be. In our Fair they can, but we have a lot of trouble. We have lost a good many exhibitors in;the open class by letting them do that. Now, in our county we let them have a pen for twenty-five cents, the open class man we charge seventy-five, cents, and he's got to be there on the opening night and enter. But on their opening day they will rash in, and if they win the prize since they have the same judge to judge the stuff they rush out and.get a season ticket and go show in the open class. The facts of the case are that we lose on our open class business by letting them go in; and I think our Association is going back and make them stay in their own class. I think it is a fine thing for them to compete against each other, but when the person competing in the open class pays seventy-five cents and has to enter at a.certain time it is not a fair proposition, and I believe that they should be in their own class. . PRESIDENT MATZKE: Is there anyone else that wishes the floor on this question? .-...-'¦' JOE LAUGHLIN, Dundy County: We had about the same proposi - tion up at our Fair last year which he explained, and I found it this way; that it discouraged quite a few members from showing in the open class. You will find the majority of exhibitors have children in the 4H Club, and they figure they will put all the work on this boy's 4H Club calf and won't bother about taking one down to show in the open class. I believe it is a good thing not to let them show in the open class. .1. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you, Joe. Is there!anyone else? MR. WHITESCARVER-. In our County we are not far enough along with a 4H Stock Division, but we do have in the children's department up there to the high school exhibiting in the fancy work, and things of that kind. I would like to hear from somebody in that respect, as to how much may be set aside for their premiums. We have a sepa - rate class, and we have been during the last two years dividing it up in proportion to the amount of exhibits, and have given them equal space, according to present resources, which are small, but we are planning on drawing aid, and would like to know just how this money is divided in both the pai-jmutuef as well as the county aid on the aid that we get. '¦; PRESIDENT MATZKE: With the permission of the people who. have been discussing, this question I will answer this. We use the .State Fair premium list. We take the State Fair premium list in order to determine that.- I ask the Chairman what amount of money he will offer. Then he figures out what the State Fair offers Perhaps Class A will be 15% of the total, anyway a certain pro - portion, and we try as near as possible to use that as a standard </seg>
         <seg id="p132">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the State Fair offering of premiums. We use that as a standard by which to gauge our offerings out there, and we try to come as close to that as we can, with such deviations as are necessary. MR. BALLWEG: I think I would bear out Mr. Hastings - statement, that the 4H Club should not compete in the open class. It causes confusion, delay and debate, and I believe they just better have a class of their own. W. A. BOCHE, Pierce County: In regard to what Mr. Hastings spoke about in regard to charging full price but letting them in; we have charged full price, the same as the rest of the people in open class, but still it wasn't satisfactory. We have lost quite heavily in the open class division through that, and I think aftei this we will try and not put them in the open class. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Is there anybody here that does favor allowing 4H Club exhibitors to show in open class? MR. MILLER. 1 just «ant to say we have changed from allow - ing to not allowing them. I was superintendent of hogs up at Washington County one year, and we permitted the boys and girls to show in open class, and the boys and girls went over in the open class and beat the old heads, and it made the old heads sore, and kept a lot of them from coming back. I said, "I have no fear, because the boys and girls, after all, are the basis upon which you build your Fair; the old men will be gone in a short time, but you still have the boys and girls." Looking at it from a broad view - it is a mighty pleasing thing to me to see the boy go out there and beat the old man; but you see the old man got sore at the boy, and that is why they changed back. The old breeders got sore because they couldn't compete with the boys, the boys were beating them at their own game, and that is just what I like. Whether it is right I won't say, but I will say I have had a great deal of satis - faction in seeing these boy., and girls go out and win over the older breeders, MR. H. F. BRANDT, Gage County: I think when you bar the 4H boys and girls from the open class you are defeating the very pur - poses which the 4H Clubs are for. There is not an inspiration any better than seeing a 4H club boy take his champion and go into the open class and compete with the breeders. It puts something into that boy or girl that they will never forget as long as they live, and I think when you bar them from open class you are defeating the very purpose it is meant for. MR. RHEA: I think the point probably missed—l agree with the statement of the gentleman before me, but when you let the boy compete in the open class after he has competed in the 4H </seg>
         <seg id="p133">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers -group, you are letfuig him take one hog, steer or whatever it might be, and you let him take the same article and the same animal and compete for two prizes, which isn't fair. Let him take one of his hogs, steers, or heifers, whatever it may be, and show it in the open classj and not- the same heifer or steer but another animal and go in the 4H class; but he shouldn't be entitled to use the same animal and compete for two different premiums. ANDYj WELCH, Seward County: In our county I will tell you how we handled that. We" had certain difficulties that came up too. We didn't jwant to bar the 4H boy from entering in the open class, so we made a ruling that the 4H boy can show any of his stock in the open class, but he must enter them before the premiums are awarded in the 4H class, before the judging is done, and pay his entry fee for his 4H stuff in the open class the same as the breeders if he wantedj to show in the open class. Therefore we have gotten away fromj that. That barred the boy from, slipping an animal that has won in the 4K class over into the open class. He has to enter his stuff the same as the breeder does, pay his entry fee for his 4H stuff hi the open class at the beginning of the Fair before the entries close. That has gotten us away from our difficulty. MR. DAVIS, Kearney County: The point is that these boys and girls should be oh the same par as our older! folks. I believe, like Mr. Rhea said over here/that these youngsters should not use the same animal in three or four different classes. Don't let him take the same gilt and show in a half dozen different classes simply be - cause there are a half dozen different classes. Why should they not be restricted; you take your kid, I take my kid, and we give them the very best we have on the farm, and naturally if he goes in and wins in the club sh^w and comes over in the open class with the same animal he has a good chance to win. The reason we have different classi - fications in County Fair work is to accommodate more people. The farmer too likes to win, he likes to carry around that ribbon on his lapel or belt. My point is this; have separate classifications so both can work together in raising champions; then let them compete so you don t have but one grand champion at! the show, whether it be poultry, or any livestock. Then if the boy loses the grand champion -hi will go home and say, "I am going to try and do that next year." PRESIDENT MATZKE: Is there-anyone further that wishes the' floor on this subject? It would be my opinion that this problem is one that must be worked out) more or less on the basis of what your community wants. As Mr. Welch has told you, we have found it very satisfactory to allow 4H stuff in open class, but in order to do so he must make </seg>
         <seg id="p134">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture his entry out, he can't wait until he sees what he is going to do in 4H before entering. He's got to pay the regular fees and comply in every way like the open class exhibitors must. He can show in both classes, but he's got to comply with the requirements of both and has no advantage in that respect at all. Is there anything further on this question ? For a number of years it has been my privilege along in December or January to attend, up in the northeast corner of this state, a banquet given by the Great Northeast Nebraska Fair Cir - cuit, composed of seven or eight counties. I have been amazed at the amount of worthwhile instructive information exchanged at these meetings. Usually about fifty men sit at the table, and they always have a swell chicken dinner, after which they discuss Fair problems and detailed reports of the counties are mimeographed and distributed among the members of the association. In my opinion it is one of the high lights of Nebraska county fair work. We are privileged this morning in having the president of that Circuit with us, and it is with a great deal of pleasure that I introduce to you the man who will give us a discussion on District Fair Associations; Mr. A. D. Raun, of Walthill. MR. RAUN: Members of the Nebraska County Fair Association; I am glad that Mr. Matzke confined all of his remarks to the North - east Nebraska Fair Circuit. We have had a circuit in Northeast Nebraska, consisting most of the time of eight county fairs, in northeast Nebraska, since 1924. The Northeast Nebraska Fair Circuit was organized in 1924 at Oakland, Nebraska, and for some few years they held their annual meetings and their quarterly meetings at Oakland, which seemed to be a sort of a central point. In 1929 they changed their system of meeting in the same town all the time; now we rotate from one member association to the other. For illustration, two years ago our annual meeting was held at Hooper, Nebraska, and the Hooper Fair Association furnished the eats and the entertainment for us that evening. Last year in October we were at Valley. The Douglas County association acted as host. At these meetings we have reports from the secretaries of the different fairs giving in detail their financial report for the year just closed. After the reports are given the meeting is thrown open for discussion, and that is where we get our largest benefit from the Northeast Nebraska Fair Circuit. The Northeast Nebraska Fair Circuit has a new member this year, Sarpy County, coming in. Now, at these discussions various questions are brought up; the principal ones that I have noticed are: premiums, 4H Clubs, admissions, free acts, rides and concessions, livestock improvement, advertising and general Fair management. </seg>
         <seg id="p135">; Nebraska Association of Fair Managers During the past two years a great deal of our time has been given to the discussion of the very problem that has come up here with its various ramifications, that is, 4H Clubs. Two years ago at Hooper, I; think, was the first time that it was seriously presented on the proposition of 4H Clubs. We urged/and I think the North - east Nebraska Fair Circuit went on record as recommending to the extension department that they put more importance on the __ Clubs dealing with breeding stock rather than feeding stock. The arguments; that have been advanced on this proposition are these: that on feeding fat stock, baby beeves, the boy or girl naturally handles that calf and gets considerable benefit that will stay with that boy or girl possibly for the rest of their lifetime; they will buy the calf and handle it for several months, figuring out the cost of every pound put on, but at the end of the period.the calf is put on the block and sold. The county gets no particular lasting good out of that baby beef. We claim, that is, a number of us do, and I happen to be one of those that is urging the breeding stock, that if the boys and girls would buy say shorthorn heifers, hereford heifers, or whatever they may be, that they would show that calf, that they would feed it along the lines of breeding, for breeding purposes rather than in the fat class and show.class purposes, and that calf would grow into a cow, and naturally it would sometime in all probability be the foundation of a pure-bred herd at that par - ticular farm, and if we have a pure-bred herd at that farm there is bound to be a lasting good to the county, community and state, and I believe it is one of the ways we can really lay the foundation for getting pure-bred livestock. We have a boy in the Northeast Nebraska Fair Circuit that started out a number of years ago with a Duroc Jersey shoat. That boy kept on, and it wasn't long before he and his father were the largest breeders of Duroc Jerseys in northeast Nebraska. By the way, he paid his way through the university as a result of his hog herd. So, in our Northeast Nebraska Fair Cir - cuit that is one of the things we give considerable discussion to, and last year I understand Washington County had a breeding club in cattle. Now, we have also talked considerable about colt shows in north - east Nebraska, and we have increased the number of colts at our County Fairs as a result of increased premiums. It happens that at our County Fair at Walthill we pay a top premium on colts of something like $10.00. One year we paid $15.00 for top colts, and you would be surprised at the increase in the number of colts we had at our Fair. We alsc talk about our free acts, our admission prices, and as a result in northeast Nebraska we have achieved considerable uniformity in the programs put On by oiir County Fairs. </seg>
         <seg id="p136">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Our Northeast Nebraska Fair Circuit isn't a group anywhere near as large as this. It is composed, as the President told you a few minutes ago, of from fifty to sixty men who are on the boards of the respective County Fairs. We get well acquainted —as Mr. Schiefel - bein said last night, he said, "I notice the men in the Northeast Ne - braska Fair Circuit seem to be a little closer to each other than the others attending this meeting". That is only natural, because we get acquainted while attending our local meetings. Another thing that has been instigated in northeast Nebraska I don't know of any other Fairs in the state that have it, if they do I just don't happen to be aware of it. That is, we have discussed and put into practice in northeast Nebraska—l should say several of the Fairs have put into effect, what we call Junior Superintendents. Each department has a Junior Superintendent as well as a Senior Superintendent, the Junior Superintendent being selected from the 4H Clubs, and being selected on the recommendation of the County Agent or Home Agent, whichever it happens to be. The different Clubs recommend to the Fair Board boys and girls that have achieved success in the 4H Club work, then the Fair Board will select the ones they want out of that group for their Junior Superintendents; and we have in several instances Senior Superintendents who have retired from Fair work, and at Walthill I know we have two super - intendents of departments just a little over twenty-one years of age that have come up from being Junior Superintendents to make a mighty fine job of it. Another point of discussion of our Northeast Nebraska Fair Circuit is the development of fair circuits. Now, as we are or - ganized at the present time, we do not have our Fairs running a series of consecutive dates, but that topic was brought up for dis - cussion at our meeting at Valley in October, and during the year considerable thought will be placed on it, and possibly some action will be taken on that matter next fall. It has been urged at our meetings that if our Fairs, particularly the smaller County Fairs, would organize themselves into a circuit not only in name but in fact, with consecutive dates—for illustration, if we would take a group of six Fairs and number them one, two, three, four, five and six, we will say, the number one Fair would start the first of August —it doesn't make any difference when they start, you pick your starting date —number one Fair would start the first of August and run the first half of the week, number two would have the last half of that week, number three would start the first of the second week, and so on through; and after we had organized in this circuit, which I call a circuit in fact, after we have organized in that circuit County Fairs of approximately the same size and County- Fairs that intend to hold approximately the same amount of free </seg>
         <seg id="p137">I Nebbaska Association of Fair Managers attractions, 1 can't you see that we could offer! something to the attrac - tion companies, something to the ride and concession companies that we can't offer them now. And the attraction companies still find the small Fairs pay for the inferior stuff that they might have, that they (can't shove off on somebody else; but if. we were or - ganized So jwe can say to the company "we can give you eighteen or twenty-four consecutive dates of operation on fairs" I believe a con - tract with ja group of Fairs of that sort would be an attraction to them. The biggest worry we small fellows have when Fair time comes is jo secure rides that are of any merit. I know the job at Walthill has been very, very difficult, to secure rides, and as secre - tary of our Fair I have had more grief in getting rides than any one thing at our County Fair. If we could tell one of these companies that have rides, "Boys, if you will sign up with us we will give you eighteen-twenty days, consecutive, and with a jump of not over fifty miles to any County Fair", I believe they would go for that, because it would be; cheap transportation and continuous employment for them. The same thing, gentlemen, I think would apply to the purchase of your free acts. We all know now about the split week. The split week means two Fairs making some sort of an arrangement between them - selves as: to dates and as to the amount they will stand/one taking the first part of the week and one the latter part of the week; but I am sorry to say that as far as I can learn the split week proposition has not been taken advantage of in this state as much as it should "c- . ..' : •/¦¦'¦:• . ' - - ' Years ago West Point, which has one of.. the most successful County Fairs in the State of Nebraska, in my opinion—l don't think it has to take a second seat, to any County Fair in this state. West Point has a very good Fair, and they purchase high class entertain - ment, and of course our Fair was considerably smaller than West Point, but West Point took the first part of the week and we took the latter part of the week/and as a result our County Fair was able to obtain and offer to our people high class entertainment that we couldn't have done if West Point hadn't taken the burden for the first part of the week. It was very satisfactory, and an arrange - ment of the most pleasant sort, but we dropped that arrangement for the reason that some of our board got to thinking that our towns were a little too close together, and, that is true, because many people that we naturally think would come to our Fair because it is in their own County are really closer to West Point than they are to Walthill, and that was the reason that arrangement was dropped; and I think that arrangement, would still be going if there was fifteen-twenty miles more distance between points. Last year we split the week with O'Brien County, lowa, and gentlemen, I assure you there is no question that on the split week proposition last year for $700.00 on our free act program we got more than I </seg>
         <seg id="p138">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture believe any of you could buy here for twelve or fourteen hundred dollars. I think we got it for less than half what it would cost you. Why did we get it so cheap? Because the company— the booking agency when they sell one of these acts for a part of the week they have to pay them so much money, so they have sold O'Brien County, lowa, on this free attraction, and they had eight separate units in this free attraction, so whatever they got from us, as far as they were concerned, except gas and oil and trans - portation, was pure velvet to the booking agency. Naturally it did us very well also, and we had an excellent program at low cost. In preparing this little talk I have written to a number of these booking agencies, and I believe that over and above the split week proposition we could still get a substantial reduction if we had a circuit whereby we could say to them, "Sign up on this proposition and we will give you eighteen to twenty-four days of work, and small overhead costs for transportation". Now then, the difficulty—it is easy to talk about a Fair cir - cuit, but it is a doggone hard job to figure out one that is satis - factory. 1 have tried the best I could, even talked to the different Fairs that I will mention; but merely for the purpose of illustration I have tried to arrange a series of County Fairs whereby I could tell you, if these Fairs would go in for the circuit proposition, "Here's a circuit we could offer": So, for the sake of my argument, I have used these Fairs: Stanton, Saunders, Seward, Sarpy, Hooper and our Walthill Fair. In the first place I think those Fairs are possibly of about the same size; second, they are geographically well located, it's not very far between each one of those fairs; third, the Fairs named in that group will not compete with one another as to their patronage. Now, if these six Fairs that I have named were to or - ganize themselves into a circuit I have put down tentative dates. I started in to put down the dates of these Fairs that they had last year, but I didn't know all of them, so we will leave that out. But, suppose these six Fairs grouped themselves together and called them - selves a circuit and had consecutive dates; then Stanton would open, assuming it was agreeable to them of course, on August 15, that would be their entry day. Let me go back just a little bit. For this circuit to work satisfactorily we would have to get back to the thing that was mentioned here yesterday; that is, the three or four day Fair, so half of this group would naturally have to be what you call three day Fairs, and the other half—wouldn't have to be, but could be four day Fairs. So, if Stanton County would have entry day on August 15th and exposition days the 16th, 17th and 18th—in other words they would have to consent to be a three day Fair, some other County could have entry day August 17th and exhibition days August 18th, 19th and 20th; Seward could have entry day August 22nd, with show days on the _rd to 25th; Sarpy County </seg>
         <seg id="p139">; '..!_/• Nebraska Association of Fair Managers • entry day the 25th and: show days the 26th, 27th and 28th; Hooper could have entry day August 29th,: and show days August 30th, 31st and September Ist; Thurston County could have entry day September Ist, and show days September 2nd, 3rd and 4th.: In theory that sounds al right; it might be very, very difficult to get this group of Fairs 1,0 agree upon dates, to agree upon the first and the last of each wee'c, and all the other various problems; but I do think, gentlemen, that with about ninety County Fairs in the State of Nebraska j there is an avenue if we give some thought and study to it, and it is well worth our time. To carry out and accomplish something! along this line, I suggest that each Fair select their dates considerable in advance of this annual meeting, and that prior to the annual meeting that the secretares- of the various Fairs write to the secretary of our association here informing him of our dates, ant then ask him to write back and let you know what other Fairs are contemplating holding Fairs at that time. Now, if each one of us coming down to these meetings knew in advance that Sarpy Couiity, Knox County, or whatever county! it is, are holding their Fair the same week we are, right away when we get here we could look up those Fairs and try to work out a split program. Surely we can work the split week proposition.! We could select some county fifty, sixty, seventy miles distant, or even two hundred miles, and arran *c a split week; then we could go together and contract for pur attractions and divide the cost.. I think that that matter is entitled to our serious consideration. I think also if we ask the secretary of this association to provide that service to us that he should be paid for rendering that service in addition to the nominal fee that he how draws. Therefore, gentlemen, I urge that all of us give serious thought to the proposition of organizing a Fair circuit in our respective communities. I believe that you men in western Nebraska, you men in southeastern Nebraska have problems that, are similar in your particular j territory that don't affect us in northeastern Nebraska, and therefore if each territory had their own association or circuit, even if you don't organize the consecutive dates, if you would get together; as a group each fall before this meeting you would have an excellent opportunity of thrashing out the problems that may come before you; you would have an opportunity of taking advantage of the new things developed by your neighbor; you would have an oppor - tunity of jtaking advantage of things that had proven a success for your neighbor that you wouldn't know of in any other way. Therefore in conclusion, gentlemen, I urge that we give serious con - sideration to some sort of organized effort in first taking full ad - rantage of our split weeks in our programs, and second in the or - ganizing of circuits, particularly for small Fairs, so that we can make arrangements for rides, and if we can do that I believe the </seg>
         <seg id="p140">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture small Fair will have solved the biggest question we have today, and that is getting rides. I thank you. (Applause) PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you, Mr. Raun. We certainly appreciate the trouble it took to get together the facts and develop the ideas you have given in your talk; and I can assure you that there are some of us thinking of getting up circuits. Our secretary-treasurer, Mr. Marshall, has the floor. MR. MARSHALL: I just want to comment on the thoughts thrown out by Mr. Raun. I have been .secretary of that Northeast Nebraska group since it was organized in 1924, and there are one or two things that 1 have noticed that I think are rather important in the organization of such groups. In the first place, as Mr. Raun pointed out, this matter of having a feed in connection with the meeting I think has more to do with holding it together and making it attractive than any other one thing, because until we started the plan of having a dinner our attendance was up and down, and we didn't know hardly what to expect; but wince we have this dinner at 6:30 and then follow the dinner immediately with the meeting, since we have put that plan in operation we know we are going to have fifty or sixty men, and practically every county is going to have as near a full representation as possible. And it has just worked out fine. It is a little expensive to the host association, probably costs them $50.00 to entertain the other Fairs, but it only comes once in seven or eight years so it doesn't amount to much, as we go around the circuit; it is but a small distance to travel, and we found that it worked out very fine up there; and as Mr. Raun said, we have gotten a lot of good out of those meetings. As to what Mr. Raun said about circuits, and the ideas along that line; I will say that I think we are going to reap some fruit from this idea that Mr. Raun has talked about. And he's now president of our Northeast Nebraska Circuit, and I think before the year's over we are really going to accomplish something in getting our section up there organized to a circuit plan. I really believe that there is something good to come out of it that will do us all some good. Now, that is all I want to say. Thank you. (Applause) PRESIDENT MATZKE: Another question has been sent up to the table here. It pertains particularly to the State Fair. I am going to read it, and perhaps Mr. Reed can advise us as to what they do intend to do in that respect. It says: "Please instruct the </seg>

Perry, l7)oTknlf how that is handled, and why difficulty should arise in that respect? MR. REED: Mr. Chairman, of course our rules call for closing those classes at a certain time, and that rule is printed a I the- P _mium_S so that they should know!before %y-nd^ose.art.c es down here len the entries close. They are not judged until the entries are closed, of course. .. PRESIDENT MATZKE:/Thank 1 you. I think it is the same problem, projmbly,. as we have in our County Fairs; as to when to cut off allowing entries. '.;• MR BALLWEG, Greeley County:: In reference to that com - plaint we _ye counties holding their Fair a week or two prior to the State Fair, and those exhibits are at the County. Fair at _ainfe aU they cannot possibly get to Lincoln to reach here three four or five days ahead of the Fair. I know" last year om ounty sent down some good exhibits. They arrived here the Satur - day preceding the Fair. The Fair opened Sunday^ morning, the ex - hibits reach! here and they were thrown out because they were too late. I think it is rather an imposition on the counties that are further out in the state to eliminate them just because of the distance: My brother had our county exhibits down here last year^ anfhetalkd to the judges/and they thought probably holding off on judging Ihose exhibits a. little later, or possibly putting on two judges on those-particular exhibits would probably give: them a break, and ihat is all we ask. Thank you. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Of the many fine things that we have out in Sewi.rd, Nebraska, there is one of which we are more proud than any otier and that is that we claim as a citizen of om-town Ere SiSey P ro_bly known to most of you fellows here. Erie gravels ove the fate of the globe, east, west, north south and wherever he goes cairies tidings of our fair city, and wherever he goes brings back to us tidings from the world. In addition to that he always - -1 r.tlS.B from one of these poultry judging trips, whether it be the HawaHan Llands, Madison-Square Garden, or wherever it may be, J Ways brings home and graciously shares with us the best line of storie^hat any manicould possibly pick,up; some of these are _h _aUey can be told anywhere, some have to haveaparWar audience seected.for them; in fact I heard a man say after listening "Erie o? a banquet program !that there used to be thing.i people couldn't .talk about, now, he says, "there are people that cant, talk about anything else." - ,; ¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p142">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture For a number of years we have tried to get him on our pro - gram. The fact of the matter is I got worked into the association here by filling in for speeches when Erie would be on the pro - gram and because of the necessity of his judging on the Denver show he couldn't be here, but this year we are privileged in having Erie with us. Last year we had him listed on the program here for a talk on "County Fairs in the South Sea Isles." It is with a great deal of pleasure and anticipation that I introduce to you at Ihis time Erie Smiley. (Applause) KRI.E SMILEY, Seward County: Mr. President, ladies and gentle - men: Stan has given me quite a reputation, I don't know whether I can live up to il or not. He's been a great help to me on many instances. Just recently we were down here and we were going to go out to the State Farm on the street car but we were a little late getting to the proper corner and I ran for the street car but missed it; Stan says, "I want to give you a little advice, a little fatherly advice." He said, "never run after a street car or a woman; there will be another along every few minutes until mid - night, artcr that they are fewer but faster." (Laughter) The Hawaiian Island,-, often referred to as the Paradise of the Pacific, are located 2150 miles from Los Angeles or San Francisco. The trip takes five days by steamer. Although there are hundreds of islands in the group, there are five which make up the main Territory. Their size is in the order named: Hawaii, Maui, Oahu (on which the city of Honolulu is located I, Molakai (the famous leper colony) and Kaue, the smallest, known as the Garden Island. One of the smaller islands of which we seldom hear is Lani, known for the unusual size and type of its inhabitants. They are all over six feet tall, of peculiar complexion, and brownish-red hair. They are called Niihu, or Redheads. The total population of the Islands now is about four hundred thousand, of which about 60'; are Japanese. Next come the Filipinos, Portugese, Chinese, and the white people, known as Haole. There are only about 15,000 pure Hawaiians in the Islands now, although at the time Captain Cook discovered them late in the eighteenth century, there were approximately four hundred thousand. The total area of the Islands would be about one-sixth the size of Nebraska. It is thought that the very first inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands came from Samoa and Tahiti, as their characteristics and color are very much the same as now found in the native Hawaiians. It is understood that they made the trip in open sailboats. They caught their water from the rains and fish from the sea. and brought but very scant provision* </seg>
         <seg id="p143">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers In the ei.rly days, there was much fighting among the tribes on - the different Islands in the group. About the tin*, the of one Island felt their strength, they would man their canoes and start a war kvith the natives of another island and many warriors would be kiled-by the thousands, in fact. The old Palais tehff just outside the city of Honolulu was the scene of the battle among the Wives.: The warriors of one group pushed those of another grout over this cliff, 1,000 feet high. The survivors became strong enough to conquer all other tribes, and were united into one kingdom to Se ruled by King Kamayamaya I. Several kings followed him! takinglhis name as Kamayamaya 11, 111, etc A sister of the last Kamayamaya came into power just; before the United States acquired the Islands as a territory. This Queen, Lihokalan,was very kindly, and much loved by her people. She is the niost famous for the grand old song, Aloha Oe (Farewell to Thee) Her in - spiration fo. the song came when she saw a native boy bidding his 'sweetheart goodbye. Her song is undoubtedly the most Wte™ in the Maims today. Liliokalani was dethroned when the Islands . became a Territory, but she was later reinstated by President Cleve - land. The old Hawaiian language had only twelve letters In the alpha - bet: "i's" are pronounced "c" and vice versa; the as. are broad, and every letter is sounded. There il no class or race disUnction in the Islands; all nationali - ties associate with one another. It is not unusual to attend a meeting where you will find all, the nationalities above named represented. Although it seemed rather strange to me on the first trip to.associate __ pfople of so many different races, it did not take long to become Iccustomed to the idea, and to realize that they are some of the finest people in existence. It was my pleasure to become acquainted __ mZfchinese, Japanese, and Portugese business and P^ssiona men, and T; can truthfully say that I have never met a fine! lot of gentlemen in all my travels. ¦'/' . It was!my pleasure to meet arid visit with many of the delegates from Washington who were sent over to make an investigation^ of the possibilities of Statehood for the Territory. They sailed on the same steamer I did. Meetings were held in various sections of the Islands. Representatives of different groups had the opportunity to appear and' speak for or against statehood. At W^.*»J***** of thepeo'ple seem to oppose it, due to the fact Vaat about 60% of the population is Japanese.

         <seg id="p144">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture near sea level. It of course is a little colder up in the mountains. Tropical vegetation is rampant everywhere, and flowers and fruits in profusion. The pineapple industry is one ol the most profitable ones in the Islands. The fruit grows on bushes not more than five feet high. The tops which we sometimes see on the pineapple in the stores here is generally removed and reset in the soil. Agricultural paper is spread over thousands of acres of these shoots which have just been pushed in in rows. The paper does away with weeds and holds the moisture. It takes about 18 months for the fruit to ripen; then it it is gathered, the tops cut off, re-set, and the fruit itself then sent to the canneries. Specialists on pineapple can tell by thumping the fruit just how much sugar it contains. The lower portion of the I run carries the most sugar. This can readily be seen after it is pared. The sweetest pint is the yellowest. We have often heard of "bread fruit", and I was quite surprised to find that it grows on a rather large tree. The fruit itself re - sembles our hedge apple, hut is considerably larger. When they ripen, they arc taken from tin- trees, cored out, and large lumps of butter put in them. They are baked in the oven and eaten with f- very little salt. The taste is similar to a very good sweet potato. Another fruit very much in evidence is the Avocado, specimens much finer in size and color than those grown on the mainland. It is im - possible to ship that clu-s of fruit out of the Islands, and there is but a small demand for them The growing of cane is another important industry. Many varieties have been developed, as growing conditions in different parts of the Islands vary so that where one kind will thrive another will not. It was my privilege to visit many of the large plantations and see the operations of planting, irrigating, etc. The ground is pre - pared with a ditch much like for our listed corn. Sections of cane arc cut from six to eight inches long, laid in the furrows, and cov - ered over. Then it is ready for irrigation. After about eighteen months the first crop is ready for harvesting. After the leaves become dry, instead of stripping them as is the custom in many other countries where cane is raised, they set fire to the field. This burns off the surplus leaves, kills off many thousands of rats that cause much damage, and leaves the stalks ready for harvesting. Only a very little of the juice is lost by firing the fields. Filipinos are the principal workers in the cane fields. The stalks are cut by hand and hauled to the sugar mills where the juice is separated and sugar made, but not refined. Practically all the refineries are on the mainland. The pulp is used to furnish the heat for juicing the cane. </seg>
         <seg id="p145">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers The school system is somewhat different than ours. There is first the Standard School to which most of the white children go. Orientals and other classes can gain admittance only after passing a very difficult examination in which they are not allowed to use any of the so-called "pigeon English". There are also public schools which all children not enrolled in either the Standard or Parochial schools must attend. The Japanese have supplementary schools which their youngsters attend after leaving the public school at 3:00 P. M. and on Saturdays. . Schofield Barracks, located just a short way from Honolulu, is the largest army post belonging to the United States. When one sees the amount of preparedness there, it seems almost impossible that any one would attempt to attack the Island. The barracks and most of the army activities in the Islands are centered on the Island of Oahu. I had the privilege to see the army review held for the Washington delegates. It took an hour arid forty-five minutes for the review. The Islands are extremely well fortified throughout, and I have been told that mines have been set as far out as forty miles to i sea; many large guns are scattered throughout the different islands, | and many of the largest fighting planes owned by the IL S. are stationed there, as well as a number of our best battleships, to take care of any emergency. Pearl Harbor, known to be the best of its kind in the Pacific, is very near Honolulu, and well defended. It is ' my opinion that the Island of Oahu itself is perhaps the best pro - tected holding of the United States. !•- The hospitality of the Hawaiian people is second to none. There was scarcely a moment when there wasn't- someone to show me the many points of historic and scenic interest. My Hawaiian friends, Mr. and Mrs. Advid Kinney, who have lived there all their lives are of course familiar with all the places of interest, particularly on the Island of Maui. They spent a great deal of time showing me the most interesting and beautiful places. One morning a party of us got up at 3:00 A. M. to see the old extinct crater Haleakala, the largest of its kind in the world. It is more than seven miles across the top. During my stay in Honolulu, 1 was invited to talk to the Chinese American.Legion Post of that city. The requirement for member - ship is thit one be either a pure or part blood Chinese. The meetings a:-e held in a room of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, which was the first building to be erected by the Chinese people in Honolulu. They have a most beautiful setting, with gorgeous decora - tions and t&gt;akwood furniture. </seg>
         <seg id="p146">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I remember one very interesting luncheon given by a Chinese friend, Dr. Mm Hin Li. The group consisted of nine Chinese doctors, and myself as the only Haole (white man) present. Another Chinese friend and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Tarn, entertained with a very interesting feast known as a Luau. The Luau is a native Hawaiian feast, and the original idea, I am told, was to cook a dog underground, but pigs are used now. A large pit is dug and large rocks heated in it. After the carcass of the pig has been dressed out, the boys dip their hands in cold water and bare-handed pick up the hot stones and put them in the carcass. Tei and banana leaves are wrapped around the pig, covered with more hot rocks and soil and the pit is closed and allowed to stand for several hours, depend - ing on the size of the pig. Sweet potatoes are baked inside the car - cass. If the Luau is held outdoors, a long table has been arranged and prettily decorated with fern leaves and flowers. Numerous delicacies have been prepared, and all food is eaten with the fingers. One &lt;&gt;f die iiin-i common foods is Pui. containing much starch. It is made from Tarn, which grow- in moist places. The substance is pounded, thinned with water and allowed to start fermenting. Mullet, one »f the finest fish to be found in the Islands, is baked whole, and is ready to eat when the eyes drop out. Another great delicacy is Octupus, commonly known as -Squid, and a certain variety of sea crab is supposed to be very choice. I could not quite decide how to go about eating the latter, and asked a lady who was sitting near me. She said "Just turn him upside down and unbutton him". There are many different ways to prepare coconut and tai'o dishes, which are considered most tasy and nutritious. At nearly all Luaus the famous Hawaiian drink "Okolihau" is served. It is my belief that if it were thinned with Carbolic Acid, it would be more easily taken. There is only one Fair in the entire group of Islands every year, and that is the Maui County Fair. It is really a gala occa - sion for everyone in the Islands. ' They all take their fair very seriously, particularly the workers on the large plantations. Each year a Director is appointed. It is his duty to stage a successful fair, and he receives no compensation. He is usually the manager of one of the plantations and is loaned to the Fair Association for this activitj'. In order that everyone may attend the fair, the plantation owners deduct 25c per month out of the workers' pay for three months before the Fair, and in this way when the time comes, the tickets are paid for and vacations are provided for the workers. Children are released from school for the event. Only three kinds of livestock are shown—dogs, pigeons and </seg>
         <seg id="p147">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers poultry.!'.,'._ p expense is snared in bringing the judges over from the mainland. In 1935, at the time of my first visit, the Dog judge was brought from New York, the Pigeon judge from California, and of course myself from Nebraska. Transportation from the Pacific Coast is famished by the Matson Navigation Line, and is arranged through the fair association. Many of the industrialists of the Islands are heavy stockholders in the Matson Line. One of the main reasons for importing the judges is the suspicion that exists among the different nationalities regarding the judging of entries in the Fair. Each is quite skeptical about discrimination which might influence a judge of a different nationality in placing the awards. . -.. '¦ The Jc-y Zone at the Fair is much the same as what we know as a Carnival. A small circus is imported from the mainland, and as it is the only event of its kind during the whole year, everyone goes to the side shows, plays the various games of chance, take the rides, etc. One afternoon is devoted to horse racing, and such a motley bunch of riders you have never seen: Parka (pronounced Parkay, or Chinese); Japanese, Portugese, Filipinos, are all in. The races are very exciting, although racing is not a profession in the Islands. The plantations, usually have a few good horses that could hold their own under most any conditions. This past October it was necessary to carry fiur of the riders out in ambulances, after two races. Some of them did not have their saddles on properly, others fell off and got into the jams. The last race of the afternoon was the ladies' race, and they did a good job of it. One of the principal attractions is football, played bare-footed. The only clothing worn is shirt and trousers, and the boys do a better job if playingthan most of our teams on the. mainland. Volley - ball is another very interesting sport in which teams from the dif - ferent plantations play against those from the other Islands, com - peting for the trophies. The flower exhibit of the fair is divided into three days. The first day ii devoted to Dahlias and other varieties, one of the most gorgeous &lt; xhibits I have seen. The second day is Lei day, and the womei. come from all the Islands with their, beautiful neck - pieces. Tie third day is given over to the Hibiscus, which is the territorial flower. It grows in thousands of varieties in as many different colors. A Hibiscus blossom is in perfect condition for only one day, and requires no water for that day. After that it must be discarded. . In addition to the livestock and flowers, other exhibits consist </seg>
         <seg id="p148">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of vegetables and fruits. There were more than fifty varieties of bananas shown. One of the best native fruits grown in the Islands, in my opinion, is Papaia. It grows on trees, usually bearing the fruit at about four feet. The blossoms are at the top and the ripe fruit at the trunk of the tree. It bears continually for many years, and then the tree gets too tall, and as they are veiy brittle they break down during the high winds. It was my pleasure to judge the poultry exhibit at the Maui Fair. There are many ardent poultry fanciers in the Islands, and I was pleased to find the quality of the birds superior to what they had been at the time of my first visit in 1935. These people import many birds from the mainland for the improvement of their stock, and are doing a very good job of it. The evening shows before the amphitheatre consisted of a rather lengthy program of Hawaiian singing and dancing. At the same time there are prize fights in the pavilion, some of the fastest I have ever seen. The boys who enter the fights are usually matched against Filipinos. They seem to be the most enthusiastic fighters I have ever seen, and are very fast on their feet. At the close of the Maui Fair, I returned to Honolulu, where I judged the poultry at the show of the Honolulu Poultry Fanciers' Association. This show was under the able direction of my good friend, Dr. H. L. Chung. He was assisted by Charles S. Y. Ching Aug. Gomes, Dr. K. I. Chun, H. K. Miller, Joseph and A. C. Gouveia,' and Frank Botelho, superintendent of the Territorial Game Farm. Thirty-eight thousand pheasants were raised last year on this farm Other assistants were Eddie Rowold, C. K. Holt, and the enthusiastic" fanciers, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Akana. I wish to repeat that the hospitality of the people of the Islands cannot be equalled in any part of the world. We were never allowed to have a dull moment, and they spared no effort to make our stay one continual round of pleasure. However, after a rather lengthy visit, it was necessary for us to sail away. One who has never seen a sailing from the docks at Honolulu has missed the sight of a lifetime. Ladies with flowers and leis are lined up for blocks selling their wares, and anyone leaving friends in the Islands is usually decorated with flowers until he can hardly see out. The Royal Hawaiian band with singers, is always on the docks to welcome and bid farewell to the passengers. It is always a sad thing to leave such wonderful friends as one makes in the Islands, the most beautiful setting in the world. It was a mighty pleasant trip, and I am sure that if any of yon folks have an opportunity to go over you will find the same hospitality and courtesy that were extended to me; and if you should ever con- </seg>

PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you very much, Erie, that certainly was interesting. We certainly appreciate it, and I want to say that we do appreciate the restraint you exercised in the selection of the stories you t&gt;ld. ¦ Our association is indebted to Perry Reed for having obtained for us the next speaker on our program. He came early, came in here from the Denver Livestock Show and got here Sunday after - noon, and has been attending our meetings and meandering among and talking to the members of our association ever since Sunday. I had occasion to have some talk with him for a few minutes and I came to the conclusion after listening to him a while that it would be foolish for me to attempt to find out a lot of facts about his past history so I could give him a great send off or introduction. The man actually speaks for himself, and he knows what he: is talking about! I am deeply appreciative, and happy to be able to introduce to our association at this tiriie Charles. W. Green, the secretary of the Missouri State Fair. Mr. Green. . MR. GREEN: Mr. Matzke, I thank you very, much for that very nice introduction, and may I say to you all first that any of you who! have some other engagement don't look at your watch now, because I am not going to talk very long, perhaps seven minutes at the outside; Stanley told me I should talk thirty-five or forty minutes, but I will not do that. When Perry wrote me asking me to come up here I was very much pleased, because I much believe that an exchange of ideas is the greatest thing for any organization, and all organizations. 1 have learned several things that I; am sure will be of benefit to me in our Fair, and I certainly enjoyed the trip. I have heard a lot about Mr. Smiley in the past, and we have had some correspondence with reference to him coming down and judging for us at our show; I don't remember just what occurred, maybe he had a. previous engagement; but I say to you that we hope very much in the near future to have Mr. Smiley down there to do.for us a good job of judging, as he always does. Another thing, our local group is always asking me to get somebody to talk to them—they have fine meetings always during our Fair, and lie would certainly be the answer to one of those problems. I have enjoyed being h-sre, gentlemen, very much; listening and gettirf: ideas from all of you that I am sure will help me. '-'!/. </seg>
         <seg id="p150">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Now, what I have to say—or will say to you will be about facts that I have gathered in about twenty years that I have been connected in the Fair business and about five years that I have been in direct charge of the Missouri State Fair. I am sorry that I can't bring to your glance a county organization of Fairs in Missouri, be - cause we do not have one. I think it is very much to be deplored, and I have been attempting for five or six years to get the county Fair and Community Fair executives together so that we might make it an organization such as you have here. I had a good friend of mine in the legislature to introduce a bill—he didn't get very far with it.—to the end that we might establish in our State district Fairs that would be feeders for the State Fair and at the same time build up our county organizations, something like the gentleman from northeast Nebraska spoke about here. We don't have anything like that at all, and 1 have felt in the operation of our State Fair that it is really a bad thing. We need it very much. I think you are very much to be congratulated on having an organization like that. Now, the basic principles governing the success of all Fairs, either large or small, are very much the same, they are almost identical; and what I expect to say to you is applicable alike to community, county and district Fairs. I think that all of us realize that the underlying principle of all successful Fairs, and that upon which the success or failure of all Fairs depends, is attendance; without a large attendance all other efforts fail; and I believe and have be - lieved since I have been in active charge for five years of that Fail - down there that advance planning will do more to guarantee us success than any other thing that we might do. You know, I am not much of a speaker, my wife says I am just a fair talker; so I just set down a few of these things here, and she said to me "don't go up there and read your talk, remember it". Well, I know some of it, but I have set different things down here, and I am going to give* them to you as they have occurred to me, as I have found them, and as we have put them into practice and to work. Some of them haven't worked out just exactly right and the next year we have changed them. 1 believe in working out a Fair and selling it to a large number of people that this advance planning is absolutely necessary. No Fair of yours or mine can hope to eliminate all detrimental practices, but careful early consideration of every depart - ment of your Fair and mine will do much to guarantee us a satisfied public and financial independence. After all, you have got to satisfy your public. Every Fair, I believe, however small, should be operated on a three phase principle. First, careful adherence to a logical financial budget. Second, to build your Fair to fit that budget. And third, intensive selling of your Fair and mine to every person in its natural territory. </seg>
         <seg id="p151">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers Now, by a "logical budget" I do not necessarily mean a small budget; if it is too small it will hamper your various departments, and your Fair will lose its effectiveness. For that reason I think your budget should be built with a moderate degree of confidence; often a slight change in the budget will change that department from a mediocre department to a profitable department of your Fair! Of course ideally we should strive for the impossible, that is to strike a median between an educational Fair and one that is a success financially. It might take four or five years to build your budget to one of the greatest advantage to your particular Fair. I believe that the three divisions of any Fair in which it is dangerous to set too low a budget are premiums, attractions, and publicity. These, to my mind, are prerequisites of any successful Fair, Now, jou know that primarily your Fair and mine is built to attract numerous exhibits and large crowds to see and examine those exhibits; the larger the premiums' you are able to offer the higher class entries you receive; I have found that the quality of en - tries increases almost in direct relation to the value of premiums that you ofer, and higher class entries attract greater attendance always. Nc-w, in these modern days I think it is almost imperative to put on attractions of the highest available quality, commensurate with your budget.. To me a good grandstand attraction will be directly reslonsible for a great portion of your, annual revenue, and also increase your attendance at your outside gates. A lot of times you can't buy shows or acts outright for cash, and you know they can be had on a percentage basis. So, I believe good prizes, good grandstand attractions, good exhibits and a good clean carnival are absolute y necessary to a successful Fair. Now, a good clean car - nival can b; had by early consideration and careful booking. Only good clean shows, rides, and concessions should ever be allowed to appear on 4our midway; and if you proceed along that line your carnival will produce for you a good portion of your concession in - come. . Now, to sell the Fair to the! public; you may have the finest exhibits and the greatest attractions ever seen in your territory, but your public will know little of that unless you tell them in a loud voice and ir every conceivable way. They must be told about it. I think that you should have some something to attract nearly every class of citis ens in your territory, then proceed to tell them by every possible me:,ns of exploitation. In selling the Missouri State Fair we have considered newspaper advertisements to be the best single medium. We have profitably increased our newspaper allowance over the past two or three years, and at the same time we have added to our budget for billboards, outdoor panels and radio announce - ments, because every single! medium seems to attract its portion of the </seg>
         <seg id="p152">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture business. Like this advertising campaign, we try to keep good usable news stories in the hands of the editors throughout the state. We try. to make these stories informative, and sell the Fair through indirect suggestion. We also follow these methods through by getting com - mercial and social and fraternal organizations to stage booster meet - ings or trips, something like that, and they produce word of mouth advertising, the most effective of all. Now, I believe that care should be taken not to set your ad - mission fees too high. A good many small Fairs and several of the larger Fairs have proved in the last few years that a reasonably small gate charge is enormously more profitable than an exhorbitant one. You must make your public pay, but not too much. After all people expect to pay for something that pleases them, and at the same time they must be sent home with gratitude in their hearts for having come to your Fair. Another innovation that the Missouri State Fair has brought out is elimination of passes. After the elimination of passes imme - diately our public began to gain respect for our Fair, and the past two or three years have seen marked improvement in the attitude of the public toward our Fair, and I consider that one thing alone to be a hundred times more beneficial to the future of our Fair. Unquestionably the lower gate charge and the elimination of passes has increased our grandstand and coliseum money, and our annual income by leaps and bounds. Every person who comes through the outside gate must pay, beginning with our Governor and down to the bus boy. The secretary who is getting a salary and running the Fair pays—l pay to go to work; and your secretary and your manage - ment have a lot more time to meet and visit with exhibitors and patrons instead of spending all of your time telling this gentlemen why you can't give him a pass when you gave this fellow one. Those are some of the ideas we have had—the present manage - ment have put into effect and found to be very good. I want to tell you something while I think of it too, that I didn't get down; a great many of us in Missouri appreciate and think that you in Nebraska have solved the problem better than we have, that is, that we have not been able to get a legalized parimutuel bill, and we like your system of a non-profit plan. Now, you don't let the gamblers and crooks from another state come in and run this thing, you run it yourself. I have no information as to what you re - ceived from that practice, but we are going to bat again in Janu - ary, and we are going to try and get it done. But we would like it very much, and I think your plan is much better than that of a lot of states around us that have it. May I repeat that I believe that careful planning of your Fair </seg>
         <seg id="p153">I Nebraska Association of Fair Managers in every department. in relation to itself and to each other depart - ment will do very much toward giving you a Fair that you want and making it a success, on your ledger and in the minds of your public. | Thank i you very much. (Applause) -. j :.'¦.'' .-'¦.'¦: '•• PRESIDENT MATZKE: Mr. Green, there is one thing I would like to askJ What is your admission charge down there in Missouri? ..¦--. -1 •-.'•-. -.¦ .... . ¦ MR. GREEN: Twenty-five cents; everybody pays it. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Twenty-five cents regardless of age? MR. GREEN: No, a child over eight years. PRESIDENT MATZKE: And what are your grandstand admis - sions?. MR. GREEN:7 We have .fifty cents; but I tell you what, we give them a show out in front of that. I have stressed three things which I think it is very dangerous to put too low a budget On. I was in - terested in 1 County Fair work before I went over to the State Fair, and we operated on the same plan of giving them something, don't cheat themJ May I tell a story I told the other day? PRESIDENT MATZKE: Go ahead. MR. GREEN: In 1934 we had a.very serious drouth. We had advertised fireworks—l aril not selling fireworks for anybody, but I believe in not cheating your public. The Governor called me to come down: to his office—'l might'say that in our state we have no State Board of Agriculture, no State Fair Board, no Board of Managers; I am appointed by the Governor, the Governor names the secretary; I am answerable to the Commssioner, and the Commissioner and my - self operate the Fair and answer to the Governor. He had me come down and talk about the Fair this year because of the drouth. He said, "I am very much afraid that we will have to cut out some of the stuff." I said, "if we have to cut anything out, let's cut out as little as possible, because I believe that any cancellation will cost us, and it will be five or ten years before we get back to the place where'we were." One of the things the Commissioner didn't like was fireworks, so fireworks went out the window. The second day of the Fair I heard my secretaries telling someone in the outer office that the secretary was busy, so I said to send that man in. He came in with his wife and some little children, five or six of them, and says, "Are you the.secretary?" I said, "Yes." He said, "I think you are a hell of a secretary, you advertised fireworks and you haven't got it; now, just how much money do you think I have got to spend on your Fair?" I said, "Will you tell that to the </seg>
         <seg id="p154">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Governor?" He said, "I am telling you." I said, "Will you write a letter to me so that I can show it to the Governor?" He was right down my alley, and I explained what I wanted him to do. He said, "Well, me and the old lady talked it over and thought we would like to come down and see the fireworks; I know you have fine live - stock, you have chickens and you have cows on exhibition; 1 got them things at home, I want to see something I can't see at home what do you think I came to the Fair for?" So that gave me an idea; don't cheat them, if you advertise something give it to them, and if you put something in front of the grandstand give them a show! PRESIDENT MATZKE: I wish all of you men could have been privileged, as I was the other day, to set up in Mr. Green's room and listen to him go on and on listing his experiences; there are many things that he said that we could certainly gain worthwhile help from; and we do appreciate the matters that have been brought us this morning, and we hope you have gotten something from our meeting to pay you for the time and trouble you have gone to to be here with us. We have a little time here; if there are any questions anyone would like to have discussed at this time we would be glad to throw the floor open for open discussion. A DELEGATE: What do you do about passes to carnival em - ployees, passes for concessions and passes for exhibitors ? MR. GREEN: We charge every person who comes through the gate of our Fair, whether they be exhibitors, concessioners, carnival people-everybody that comes around there pays to get in Now when they started that we were a little afraid the newspapers would not play with us, but they were the first fellows to fall in line We signed a contract with a good-sized railroad show, and it is in the contract that there are no passes, eveiybody that works with that carnival will pay his way in; that goes for everybody. The first year we put this in effect one of my gatemen came up to my office and he wanted to know how many wives I had. I said, "I just have one." He said, "We had five women down there that said they were Mr. Green's wife and wanted to get in." I said, "What did you do . He said, "1 got a quarter from each one of them." MR. VANCE: Does your city down there help you any with your Fair? What I mean is does the city give you a lot of work free, or does the Board of Supervisors give you anything? MR. GREEN: I will tell you how we handle that, Mr. Vance I go to the Chamber of Commerce, I am a director in the Chamber of Commerce anyway, and I ask them-I don't ask them, I tell them how much the city of Sedalia shall give to the Fair. The first </seg>
         <seg id="p155">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers time I went down and told them that one fellow wanted to know how come I was going to tell them how much they should give. I said, "It isl the only state institution you have in your town, the only one you will have, and if you don't make an attempt to support it they may move this one away." So I tell them, and they raise the money (for: us. They set up an information bureau, and things like that, but I tell them how much money the Missouri State Fair wants them! to put in our till to help run the Fair. They asked me what they would have to do with that, and I said, "You won't have anything to do with that, the management of the Fair wants a thousand dollars—two thousand dollars, and you pay it into our office and we will give you credit for haying done that." PRESIDENT MATZKE: At this time Perry Reed has some facts and figures that I want him to give us the benefit of. MR. REED: I have made a little sketch of the reports of the different county organizations. At the time these figures were made we had sixty reports in: REPORT OF 1937 NEBRASKA COUNTY FAIRS Sixty' Reports received—January 23, 1938.

IN lOWA 37 COUNTY FAIRS SHOWED A DEFICIT OF AN AVERAGE OF $600.00 EACH: 38 SHOWED A PROFIT. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Thank you very much, Perry. Is there a discussion of any questions pertaining to county fairs that you could take up at this time? MR. JOE LAUGHLIN: We have a problem out there that we haven't been able to solve, to our poultry department we have trouble with a few families that have very good flocks of chickens who will come in and enter a bunch of chickens in certain groups under the head of the household, and another group under each one of the children; consequently last year we had one of the biggest poultry shows, I think, in that part of the state. I don't know whether the representative is here from Imperial or not, but we borrowed all the coops they had and still ran short; and I would like to know if somebody has an idea as to how to solve this problem. We thought we might order that minors show in separate classes in the 4H groups; but that would be a little selfish on our part due to the fact that some of the children in the outer edge of the county do not have the privilege of belonging to the 4H Club. I would like to have a solution for that problem. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Does anyone here have any ideas on Mr. Laughlin's problem? A DELEGATE: I am wondering if the objection is that it was too large a show; was it an objection to have an unusually large show? MR. LAUGHLIN: Well, we don't like the idea of having to enter so many chickens, and we don't figure it is quite fair to have one family entered under all the classes, like the Mrs. entered her chickens in one class, then they take another group and enter an - other class. We had one family last year that entered seven dif- </seg>
         <seg id="p157">Nebraska Association of. Fair Managers k ¦..' ferent breeds of chickens; and I .think when we finished up we had about every breed of chickens that, could be mentioned, and some I never heard tell of before. A DELEGATE: I would think if I was putting on the show the more you could get the better show you would have; I would encourage it rather than discourage it.:..-.-' MR. (LAUGHLIN: The trouble we had was this: they would come in and if they, would see there is not: going to be very many entries in a certain class they would run home and get a chicken to put in it.

I LAUGHLIN: I would like to ask you something else in regard to that problem. Do you advise group chickens, or should they show in separate coops? Do you advise them to show three or four classes out in the pen, or separate? MR. | SMILEY: No, each one a separate entry. There is no occasion [that I can see why a bird should be shown twice on the classification. ¦".../¦:, i . "-. -'¦ '. *''.... ¦-¦;¦¦ .-.' ..'-. - " . . ¦-. ¦ MR.

Wluvt is your pleasure as to the proceeding? . MR. RUSSELL: I move that our present officials have done an excellent job; therefore I move you that'the rules be suspended and they be elected; to act for the ensuing year.

         <seg id="p158">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I might say on behalf of Mr. Steele and Mr. Marshall and my - self that we think you have selected a very fine group of officers to take the place of those you had last year, who probably weren't so good. I would like to call your attention to the excellent gavel that I have been wielding with such excellent success. The gavel was presented to last year's convention, as you recall, by Mr. Johnson, and was made from the hub cap of a model T Ford and made by a local craftsman up there; and I want to call your attention to it because it is a fine implement to have here, and I know we all deeply appreciate having it. By the way, I have been told that the blacksmith who made it passed away last summer. He's made thou - sands of these gavels, but they can be obtained no more, because he has passed away. Again I thank Mr. Johnson for presenting it to us last year. A DELEGATE: Mr. Chairman, after looking at the morning paper 1 think it would be very well to have R. C. take it home with him again this year. PRESIDENT MATZKE: We will extend him that privilege. MR. JOHNSON: After having been on the board for four years _nd presiding at this convention I had decided that this year I would not ask for the floor, because you had heard so much of me in the past. But I will have to defend myself a little bit here, and to those of you who have seen the morning paper—now, I hope there won't be a rush sale for the paper at the news stand out here, but when I saw the paper this morning I wired our mailman to leave my paper in the post office so my wife won't see it; so I wont need to take the gave! home, Mr. Matzke. MR. JOHNSON: Mr. Matzke, I am not through yet. PRESIDENT MATZKE: Go ahead. MR. JOHNSON: Mr. Matzke forgot yesterday to appoint a Resolutions Committee, and there is a bunch that got together and resolved that Mr. Matzke would not preside next year at the annual meeting, even if he were elected, if he didn't remove that brush (laughter); at least I will never invite him down to our county, as I did last year, it was just sprouted then. But, coming to a bit of seriousness, having served as vice president for two years and president two years I realize the work that this committee has had in order to bring out such a good showing at this convention and such a wonderful program, and I don't think it is out of order at all if before we adjourn we express a rising vote of </seg>
         <seg id="p159">Nebraska Association of Fair Managers thanks t) our committee for this splendid program. I would make that as a motion. Without having a vote everybody rise. (Menbers arise unanimously and applaud) PRESIDENT MATZKE; Thank you, very, very kindly. •I wi 1 certainly give serious consideration to Mr. Johnson's sug - gestion 1 hat the brush be removed before next year, and I assure you, gentlemen, that if the grasshoppers are gone next summer 1 will remove the brush. I do want to say before we adjourn that being president of - this organization is not much of a job. We' have a secretary that sees all, knows all, and does all. The secretary, Chet Marshall, takes care of ill, and about all the president has to do is to come up here when the convention is called and look smart and act smart. I want to thank Chet most heartily for what he has done to make this convention a success. I alsi want to thank Joe Steele. A man couldn't help but have a successful convention with the help of, these two men; it couldn't be any other way. I alsi) want to thank you who turned out, especially you new men. Before we adjourn I want to appoint the following Legislative Committee: Andy J. Welch, of Milford; Chairman, A. A. Russell, of Geneva, and. Joe S. Steele, of Kimball. I want to remind the Presidents of the Fair Boards and Dele - gates to the meeting of the State Board of Agriculture that the law prov dcs that at the meeting of the State Board of Agriculture each menber of the Board of Agriculture shall have a vote therein, and one delegate or the president of each county Fair. You have now done your duty to the County Fair Association, but be sure and stay for the meeting of the State Board of Agriculture. That is part of your duty as County Fair men, to assist the State Board of Agriculture in their labors. Stay for the banquet tonight and take in the S:ate Board of Agriculture, meetings this afternoon and to - morrow. If thare is nothing further the meeting will stand adjourned.

         <seg id="p164">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PRESIDENT _ ADDRESS C Y. THOMPSON Since I got my speech but ten or fifteen minutes ago, I don't know much more about what lam going to say than you do I will say this, however, I never was as much convinced as I am at the present time of the inestimable value of this organization to h state of Nebraska. Year after year we have, I believe, had one of t,. won r n proe,ar::- Each yeav we get out an w t.iat is worth far more than the price of the membership of this 01 - -"ucT'S'th i ! eVeu th! ''eSUItS °btained throu^h °ur effo^ «« of &gt;uch kind that ,t ,s hard to appreciate, and yet, they are there. I think one of the greatest benefits of an organization of this Kind is that yon have some of the more progressive farmers who are interested in developing the best varieties of grains and grasse,, th, best types of farm management, and to give over their farms as a proving ground for some of the things that the Experiment Sta - fion |„ carrying on on, here at the College. To back up that work and make ,t more effective, after the College has developed varieties of Brains and grasses that show unusual promise, they are taken out bj _ these farmers .„ various sections of the state and given a trial After this, we afford a service of certifying this seed so that you can buy purebred seed just the same as you buy a purebred animal. I think you might be interested in some of the figures that Mr fnTl ."To -T'i e, CeVtified 2805 awes «* "heat, and there are now foi sale 49,00, bushels of certified seed. There were 1255 acres of barley certified and 26.109 bushels for sale; 521 acres of oats, and 15,822 bushels for sale; hybrid corn 1,708 acres, and 28,091 bushels; i,' anno SOVgo', a, CreS ' and 7°3 '000 P°Unds; Ear'y kal° 6g3 acres, and Hoi" 7 S M ' 3° aCl'eS ' and 17 '000 P°unds: Red, 8 acres, - and 12,000 pounds; and Kalo, 6 acres, and 6,000 pounds for sale. Some of you may remember a year or so ago how hard it was to get certified Atlas sorgo, and some of us thought we were buying Atlas and we had most anything but Atlas, and sometimes we had everything but Atlas. Hybrid Corn Exhibit Most of you saw the hybrid corn exhibit at the State Fair I certamly think we did ourselves proud in that exhibit. I believe it was of as much interest as anything you saw at the State Fair' At least, every time I came around there I saw quite a number of farmers enjoying that exhibit and asking questions and taking some of our cn-culars. I believe, according to these figures, that IoS </seg>
         <seg id="p165">j Nebraska Crop Growers' Association circulars on questions and answers on hybrid corn, were)distributed. The roots of hybrid and ordinary corn were compared in the exhibit. I want to say right here I saw one of the finest illustrations of that at the lowa State Fair. They had washed out the root system of a stalk of hybrid corn there and put it up on the side of the wall and those roots were about as thick and kinky as the wool on a negro's head, and went! down in the ground nine feet, the longest roots nine feet. I don't know if it would do much good in the state ; of Nebraska if it went down 20 feet,'but it shows they have the root system. There were some enlarged photos in the Nebraska exhibit showirg drouth resistance of hybrids and I think you will agree, all those vho saw the exhibit, that it was well worth while. Grass and Weed Exhibit Wj had a grass and weed exhibit cooperatively with the Depart - ment of Agronomy and the State Department of Agriculture—live plant Specimens. I think most of you saw those weed exhibits there which! were also very fine and educational because a good many of our farmers don't know some of these noxious weeds when they see them. The exhibit also showed weed types and eradication methods. Then we had considerable to do with this bindweed legislation. I think) it was largely because the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association ¦ sponsored this legislation that we were able to get the bill which we now have/and I want to say I believe that our Association has as much mfluence down at the State House as any organization that I {¦:¦¦¦¦ know of. They have a lot of confidence in what we are trying to do out here. Mr. Klatt and Mr. Smith and Mr. Eggert have been out over the state, and Mr. Si., I believe, has been carrying on an edu - j cational program. I don't believe that they have thus far established j a bindweed. district, but out at Scotts Bluff county I believe that 90% j. of the I farmers there voted for such a set-up, and only 51% are / required. I can't, unfortunately, report to you that they have started 1 and the fanners have a chance to really know how it operates. !j • . We also had something to do with hybrid corn legislation. We I had certain individuals going around the state selling ordinary cross - j; bred ccjrn that looked pretty good as hybrid corn. There is nothing /.; going to hurt our hybrid corn program more than something of that | kind, and so we took up that kind of legislation and from now on the ( term hybrid corn will be protected against fraudulent use.

Some of the members of that team will be here and I am going to call on Mr. Frolik later to present them and tell something about their winnings. In the 4-H judging team we also had the high man at Chicago, and I am sure we are all proud of the record of our boys, not only in grain judging but in our other 4-H teams sent out. We are proud of the record they have made. The value of those things is simply impossible to estimate in dollars and cents. These boys will go out and take prominent parts in the advancement of agriculture. We had the Pasture Contest. There were 800 entered in the Pas - ture Contest and I believe about 450 were over at Omaha at the banquet. I was really sorry that I couldn't be there but I was on my way to Washington. It was really one of these things that I hate to miss. I would rather have been at the pasture banquet than in Washington on the kind of mission I was on. The Crop Growers' Association duplicated some money that was advanced by the Omaha Chamber of Commerce and we appropriated $20 to each of 13 counties making a total of $260 contributed toward this pasture contest. I think you will all agree that these pasture contests are well worth while. They have created a great deal of interest. I talked with Mr. Gardner who is on the agricultural com - mittee of the Omaha Chamber of Commerce last night. They are very anxious to help in every way they can to put forth some of the things we are trying to do for the farmers of the state. I think that we should take every advantage of that attitude on their part to help out with some of these things we are trying to do. NEW GRASSES FOR NEBRASKA By LAWRENCE C. NEWELL, Assistant Agronomist, Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. D. A. The people of the West are becoming really grass minded. This is true if for no other reason than that we have so little good grass - land left. The object of this report is to present some observations on the possibilities of improvement of our forage resources, through proper practices and the utilization of well adapted forage grasses. Work has been started with several species of grass with the object of develop - ment of new varieties similar to the development in other crops by which agriculture has so greatly benefited. </seg>
         <seg id="p167">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association The increased interest in grasses is evidenced by a growing concern . over the present condition of our pasture and range lands and the desire) to learn more about the different grasses. Specimens come to the College every week of the growing season for identification. Usual - ly the. person who sends or brings the specimen calls it a "new grass" that he has found and it is a new grass in his observation. There have been no grasses sent in that have not been noted as growing in this .-.- ¦ region! before. Many of them are very common. Most of these "new ! grasses" have been growing here, some perhaps inconspicuously, for i a longtime but they may not have been very abundant because of the competition of more favored species. Because of changing weather conditions and different degrees of utilization the important grasses in a native pasture may appear to change from year to year. In eastern Nebraska this occurred when the tall prairie bluestems were first mowed and grazed. Weather conditions were favorable for the invasion of Kentucky bluegrass, a new grass to this region and these conditions. Later, Jon the advent of drought, bluegrass largely left the eastern Nebraska pastures and meadows. Now, where overgrazing and drought have together depleted the reserves of the tall grasses, the open spaces have been filled by more drought-resistant species of the true prairie at the | expense of the previously prevailing bluestems or by the in - vasion or increase of grasses which are more at home farther west. ... . i . . ........ i ¦ ...-.-• Side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) is a notable example of a grass which has increased during the dry years in pastures that were not severely overgrazed. This is particularly noticeable in southeast Nebraska this year. Sand dropseed (Sporobolus ci-yptandrus) and western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii) are grasses common farther west that have increased a great deal in. eastern Nebraska. Where drought has been supplemented by too heavy grazing, a large number of our (pastures have gone back to annual weedy grasses as downy brome grass (Bromus tectorum) and little wild barley (Hordeum pusil - litm). With these changes, some brought about by conditions beyond j his control and others due to management, the farmer is faced with changing productiveness of his pasture lands. Either he must bring j. these lands back to better production by more judicious grazing or be contentjwith the lower production and palatability of the poorer species which do best under severe treatment Pasture Resources )¦¦¦-.-' ¦" ¦ .".-¦''.'.¦:"-.•.¦. ¦:'"-•/! :--¦ ¦¦:: "; 7. ¦-.•"¦'.

The protection of the remaining areas of native grass where they still exist is very important. Not only do these areas contain some grasses which time has proven best adapted to local conditions, but also these areas form important centers for the natural spread of the grasses to other areas. Natural Recovery It seems even more difficult to establish a satisfactory stand of a good grass on the poorest acres to be removed from cultivation. Estab - lishment by seeding may be impossible on some of the poorest land! These acres may have to go through the longer process of "going back ;;¦... to grass" by allowing them to remain idle in connection with other conservation practices. Although this process is slow and the returns /- meager, the object is to secure a grass cover. Better control of graz - ing will be necessary. The more desirable grasses from the standpoint of forage value or yielding capacity may not be the ones which will come into sloping, eroding lands. As these lands are protected and properly managed they may come back to the more desirable kinds of j native plants provided a source of seed or sod is available in nearby areas or provided successful methods of introducing species by seeding j or transplanting can be developed. Instances are being noted where j proper management has allowed a partial stand of desirable native grasses Jto come into previously cultivated land. Experiments are being conducted on the best methods of reseeding the kinds of plants thought : best adapted to such conditions. &lt; From an immediate dollar and cents standpoint, particularly to j the eastern Nebraska farmer, it is more important to establish a per - manent-grass pasture on some of his better land that will support a high-yielding, palatable grass upon which he can depend for a per - manent production of high-quality feed. Every farmer should have a small acreage of such a grass adapted to his particular locality and needs. It should, supplement his native pastures. It should make him less dependent upon the yearly seeding of an annual forage crop. It would make it possible for him to increase his pastures from one poor I one continually grazed to several good, ones by allowing adequate rest - .¦!¦¦ ing^ periods for his other grazing areas. It should make its growth at I periods of the year when it will supplement his other permanent and i . annual pastures. j !.! Choice of Grasses j What glasses then are to be chosen for these needs?

A block of buffalo Brass plants transplanted three feet apart to dry land. Lincoln Nebraska, on May 1, 1937. Photographed in October, 1937. Some pl_ta have grow, together; others have made little growth. k™ w „ can be noted in the amount and quality of foliage produced and also in seed production. Differences noted in the amount, size, and height of the seed burs may become important in the propagation of this species which presents some difficult problems of seed harvest. Only part of the plants produce seed, the others, bearing flowers which pro - duce only pollen. A few plants which have both male and female flow - ers have been found and are- being increased by cuttings. Buffalo grass, along with blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis), deserves some consideration for small areas where a short grass cover is desired. For instance, buffalo grass would do well in small, calf pastures close to the farm buildings. It would stand considerable trampling and if not shaded by taller plants could be increased from a few sods or by the establishment Of a few plants by seed. Blue grama is quite easily estab - lished from seed, having a rapid germination, in this way taking ad - vantage of small showers in getting started. Both of these grasses, although of low production, are very palatable to livestock and highly nutritious at any season of the year since they cure on the ground. Blue grama and buffalo grass are being tried out for lawns,, where difficulty is experienced in maintaining bluegrass. It should be kept in mind, however, that these are summer growing grasses and will look dead and white in early spring and late fall when bluegrass is making its best appearance. They do afford a good light green turf during the summer months, at which time they may be fully as attractive as bluegrass.--" Producing Native Grass Seed Experiments are being: conducted with the seed production and establishment of the bluestems, switchgrass, and the grama grasses.

         <seg id="p173">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association under rather dry conditions. Switchgrass forms a considerable part of the wild hay cut from native meadows and if cut at the right stage is readily eaten. It is grazed in early growth before the woody stalks appear. The species is extremely variable. Selections are being made for hay and pasture types from northern seed sources. On the whole, plants from northern sources are smaller, less coarse, and less stemmy than many plants occurring farther south than Nebraska. The seed of switchgrass is one of the best of the native grasses for seeding purposes, having a weight of about 50 pounds per bushel, a ) seed size similar to sweet clover, and it flows through a drill very well. Two-yeai--old spaced plants on dry land at Lincoln produced at the rate of 200 pounds per acre this year. Desirable types of switchgrass offer considerable promise. Western Wheatgrass. And Brome Grass ! Where aggressiveness on hard soils is desired perhaps western j wheatgrass is the answer. Seed of this grass is now available com- I mercially. It is a rather coarse, tough grass, particularly where grow - | ing in good soil with plenty of moisture. Western wheatgrass is doing ¦-.-.'.• well in some eastern Nebraska pastures where it has increased naturally \ .-'.. duringj drought years. A few reports have come in as to its desira- I-. bility. -.-. It is grazed by stock if no more palatable grass is available. Farther west and northwest where it is most.important, being used for I hay as: well as extensively grazed, it is classed as one of the palatable ;[¦;-;"'. and more nutritious grasses. Considerable variation as to amount of | forage and also quality of forage occurs in this species. If grasses like ; wheatgrass and dropseeds are coming into areas subject to erosion they :j should be allowed to spread even if for cover alone. .;-.'¦-. Among the cultivated grasses, brome grass and orchard grass offer ;¦ - the most promise. The latter continues to be one of the most easily j established grasses and the seed is nearly always available at a reason- I able price. | Brome grass seeded alone or in mixtures continues to be the best j possibility for a high-producing, palatable pasture grass. Although tha | Nebraska acreage is still low, experience is widespread enough to I ¦ recommend with little qualification the increase of this grass in eastern I Nebraska. With the retui-n of more favorable seasons, the opportunity i should be seized for starting new brome grass fields. Every eastern I Nebraska farm should have a small acreage of brome grass as perma - |: nent pasture. Best results will be secured by planting on a well pre - j pared, firmly-pac_d, weed-free seedbed. It will do fairly well under \ a wide variety of conditions but its production-would warrant putting i : it on good land. !.''-.'

The above data show clearly the tremendous influence that perennial ¦j-' grasses must play in the building, improvement, and maintenance of i soil. From two to more than four tons of living root material is found ] in the surface four inches. Other studies have indicated that approxi - mately one-half of the grass root systems are found in the top 6 inches j of soil J It may thus be calculated that live roots in the soil on an •1 acre of land may amount to as much as 10 tons or more. When it is S again, considered that the live, underground parts compose by weight I only at out one-tenth that of total organic matter, it seems probable I that in our virgin eastern Nebraska soil as much as 100 tons or more I of plan; material may be present in the soil of each acre of land. It is | upon this tough, slowly-decomposing, nitrogen-forming, erosion-resisting j plant material that the productive capacity of our soils has rested during i the past years. Gradually we are exhausting that material. On many j of our hillsides we have permitted erosion to entirely remove that por - i tion of the soil in which it existed. Legumes Not Adequate | : We^ must use legumes to restore the productivity of eroded hillsides, 5 but this practice can in no way restore the original state of the soil. .

In report - ing upon the results of some of his experiments Dr. Weaver makes this statement: "The rapid rate at which unbroken prairie soil will ab - sorb water with little or no run-off is remarkable. For example, in May 1935, four inches of water were applied to burned prairie of 7 degree slope at the rate of an inch each 30 minutes. All was absorbed. In October 1937, 11 inches of water were absorbed on a 3 degree slope during a period of four hours." The following table gives additional evidence of this important function of the roots of grass. ¦!

The granular structure of the soil and the tons of slowly I decaying fibrous material can be preserved for an indefinite period if I careful rotation and tillage methods are practiced and if erosion is prevented.

         <seg id="p178">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The Value of the Grass Canopy The third function of grass is more obvious than the other two. The canopy of leaves and stems protects the soil from the wind, pre - vents the raindrops from striking and churning the soil surface, impedes the flow of run-off water, and provides a protective covering over which water may flow without carrying away the soil particles. From the standpoint of actual erosion control the above ground parts of gras.-' are tremendously more effective than the roots. A heavy sward of grass will withstand great pressure and speed of running water without permitting erosion of the soil beneath. The I'se of Grass in Nebraska's Agriculture Whatever praise we may give to grass as an agent of erosion control, greater water absorption, and improved soil structure, it must be kept in mind that the farmer must farm the land and that the greater portion of the land may need to be in cultivated crops. Where then may grass enter more fully into our farming system? Grasses In the Rotation First of all, if we are to restore the receptivity of the soil tor water we will need to use grass more generally in our rotations. No other crop will perform so well the function of improving soil structure by granulation and the opening of channels through which rapid, non - capillary penetration of water may be accomplished. Secondly, if we are to build into the soil a stable organic material from which a more constant even supply of nitrogen may be made available to cultivated crops we must again turn to the grasses and use them more commonly in the cropping system. And lastly but by no means of least im - portance, if we are to create in the soil a greater resistance to erosion, we can find nothing better than the grasses.

The iisei of grasses in the rotation is not common in Nebraska. At one time timothy was used quite extensively in eastern Nebraska in mixtures with red clover. The decline in the use of timothy may be attributed to the introduction of sweet clover and alfalfa, or it may be | the result of a decline in the stability of soil moisture as a result of I erosion and the loss of the absorbent top soil. At this time a more ¦ drouth-resistant, longer-lived grass is needed. Brome grass seems to j fill this need. Seeded in conjunction with alfalfa this grass makes a \- ¦¦¦ vigorous J growth for an indefinite number of years. It has a dense •;. spreading root system filling the upper soil completely with a dense i interwoven (mass of fibrous material. Seeding brome with all alfalfa j- seedings on rolling land would seem to be a highly desirable practice. The problem of overstimulation of grain crops following legumes :. seems to beta increasing one in Nebraska. Legume roots decay quickly ';•- and supply for a short time a great volume of available nitrates to the | soil. As ja (Jonsequence the early growth of the following grain crop 3 ; is extremely lush. Such growth uses an excessive amount of soil mois - | ture early in the season. Unless rainfall is plentiful and timely the f crop is oftin damaged severely by drouth during the hot period of the = summer, i Since legumes alone do not add a great amount of fiber or : long-lived organic material to the soil, which aids in the absorption of | rainfall, it would seem that a mixed seeding of grasses and legumes I would greatly alleviate this difficulty. At the same time the soil could j be expected to have greater resistance to erosion through the binding ,' effect of the fibrous material left in the soil by the grass. j .':.¦¦"'¦ .1 : -. ¦ | .

         <seg id="p180">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Grass for Water Channels With the advance in the contour method of planting there is an increasing need for non-erosive water channels. Contour furrows across the slope, if unprotected by terraces usually need outlets where excess water may be carried away without excessive erosion. Grassed water channels properly located and designed will perform this function and will prevent the gradual deepening of field draws and the eventual abandonment of valuable land from tillage. Gullies can often be healed and their advance checked by fencine andl seeding them to a vigorous spreading type of grass interspersed with shrubs and trees. Gullies may also be controlled by breaking down the sides and building a broad sodded water way which permit, crossing with machinery, and at the same time affords revenue in the form of hay pasture or seed. Outlet channels for terraces can be most economically provided by seeding meadow strips where the water may be spread. Such strips can be expected to return high yields because of the added water. Grass Buffer Strips The use of grass "buffer" strips is a relatively new idea in Ne - braska . agriculture.

Managing Grasses ! Many pastures in Nebraska have been destroyed by the combination I a drouth and overgrazing. The latter has been the principal offender. . Carefully grazed meadows have come through the drouth years in good I condition. Whereas ungrazed native sod is highly receptive of water I overgrazed meadows become almost impervious to water. The decline" . in soil moisture together with the reduction in root reserves as a result " cf overgrazing is responsible for the loss of good stands of grass. It !) ¦&lt; to be expected that new meadows will be seeded to replace the old ? ones that have been destroyed. It is to be hoped that future grass '.' seeding plans particularly on the rolling land of eastern and central 7. Nebraska will contemplate a long time rotation so that all parts of ! he farm may at some time have the benefit of soil improvement through '&gt; the growing: of grass.

D.KEIM During the 1937 growing season approximately 200,000 pounds of );.. native grass seed has been harvested in Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, i and the Dakotas. As a matter of fact, during the past three years, ¦'.'¦ from 400,000 to 600,000 pounds of native grass seed has been harvested over the central plains region. These Operations have been in charge | of the Soil Conservation Nurseries headed by Jess Fults and Elvern Conard cooperating with the Department of Agronomy. ' . i~~. . ""~ . . ! 1 Production of .is- bluestem seed in rows. Tests indicate that seed of the more drsir.lile native Brasses can be ui-ouuced on a commercial scale. 1 The seed that was harvested this past summer consisted of 150,000 pounds of j the different blue stems, 10,000 pounds of western wheat, 2,000 pounds: of blue grama, 15,000 pounds of side oats grama, 5,000 i pounds of switch grass, 7,000 pounds of alkali drop seed and a number j of others in minor quantities. j In 1936 approximately 1200 pounds of buffalo grass seed was gath - | cred in the vicinity of Holdrege, Nebraska. Most of this was swept up ?.'. off of the prairie pastures with stable brooms. During light rains the j seed was washed into small windrows. Following these windrows with f the brooms added to the efficiency of this operation. Many farmers I in the buffalo grass country could do this without a great amount of ] labor and difficulty. This buffalo grass seed could be used in mix - ] tures with other native grasses and possibly some brome and crested I wheat to an excellent advantage. For lawns over the west, especially j in hard lands where irrigation is not available, buffalo grass is very satisfactory. </seg>

I do not think that scattering any kind of seed on the old dead meadows without some form of preparation or covering is good practice. ! Improvement of Better Strains of Native Grasses Mr. Newell has just stated that much work is being done on the developing of certain strains which will be better adapted for dif - ferent uses such as pasture and: hay. It is the plan that as these ¦ ¦¦;.- strains are developed that they will be sent out, possibly through growers of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association or any other' -.-; farmers who are interested in getting them started. It seems very j probably right here at home we will find the adapted grasses and legumes for our Nebraska conditions. ', ; The wild white clover and the perennial rye grass and pasture-type timothy that have made the pastures in England so famous are not worth much when planted in this country. I do honestly feel that we can make Nebraska pastures and meadows famous if we all become grass conscious and j develop these old native grasses that have been the main stay of j our range lands all over the west. ,-! j It may be necessary as time goes on to develop grass seed associa - { tions as have been done in most all of the European countries. The ! famous experiment station at Svalof, Sweden was started as a seed I association. These associations not only make it a point to keep the very best! types of certified seed on hand and available to the farmer but the constant working over the problem tends to keep eveiyone thinking in terms of grass land -management and incidentally soil conservation.

Our permanent pastures in the eastern part of the state. | are in a very bad condition, with probably 75% of the ! grasses completely "killed out". Farther west in the state, the devastation has not been as complete because the grasses found there are better adapted to withstand adverse conditions such as we have encountered during the past few years, but everywhere in the state pastures and ranges have suffered material damage. !

When the 1934 drouth struck and resulted in "killing out" of .]' much grazing land, the general thought among many farmers was -!'.'-. to come back in the spring of 1935, reseed and otherwise attempt </seg>
         <seg id="p188">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture immediately to rebuild the damaged pastures. Since that time we have gone through three more unfavorable seasons as far as pastures are concerned. We have seen not only drought and heat ruin the seed - ings, but grasshoppers have come in as an additional problem. Except in a few limited areas, most pasture seedings during the past, four years have resulted in failures. Combatting Drought And so, farmers generally have given up the idea of immediate icstoration of permanent pastures. They are agreed that we will have "to live with bad pastures" for some years to come and that during this period, other methods of getting roughage for livestock must be provided. It isn't that we are giving up permanent pastures in this part of the state or thinking that such land must remain unpro - ductive, but we will simply concede to "old man drought and his army of grasshoppers that they got the best of us during the last four years." If we an- going to beat these handicaps, we will have use for some additional weapons of combat. In other words, a lot of farmers will give up permanent seedings until conditions are more favorable, and meanwhile depend on temporary pastures, sorghums, silage, and other roughages for livestock feed. Sorghums will play a very important role in the production of ample livestock feed on Nebraska farms, especially during the period that pastures are being restored. The sorghums have definite ad - vantages in the matter of drought resistance. It is true that they cannot produce more forage or grain on the same amount of moisture than corn, but they are able to go into a dormant period when dry, hot weather strikes them during the growing season. Then when rains come, they are capable of resuming growth, whereas com burns up and dries when soil moisture is depleted. Furthermore, sorghums are definitely resistant to grasshopper injury which is especially important in a period like this when we are facing another grasshopper threat. Although sorghums are by no means a new crop in Nebraskd, they are gaining unusual attention because of the drought and grass - hopper situations. A phenomenal increase in the acreage of sor - ghums is almost certain to occur in 1935. Perhaps some folks will get overly enthusiastic about what this crop can do. It is not the "cure-all" to our drought problem, tor sorghums too can fail ; n an extremely unfavorable year. Many people, not having grown grain sorghums in the past, will make some mistakes in producing them and will be disappointed in some of the results. For example, I saw a 200 acre field of Early Kalo this summer, not over 10 or 15 acres of which produced grain. The reason for the poor results was that the crop had been seeded too thick. Had this man grown </seg>
         <seg id="p189">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 10 acres before he went into the crop so heavily, he would have had a better idea how to handle it and consequently probably would have been more successful with it. We should not forget too, that there are harvesting, feeding, and marketing problems in the production of sorghums different from those encountered with corn. Use of Temporary Pastures The temporary pasture crops, although well known to every farmer, are so important during the present period that they are worthy of brief discussion. Rye, the best crop for late fall and early spring pasture, did not have much of a growth in many sec - tions of Nebraska last fall because of dry weather. However, if we get additional moisture before spring, it will still make plenty of pasture in March and April. Those farmers who did not get rye seeded last fall can, plant it extremely early next spring and under average . conditions will obtain satisfactory results. Sweet clover, well known to all of you, is important in a temporary pasture program. The second year growth is very productive during May, June and July. ... First year sweet clover often provides a good deal of late summer and early fall feed. •-.;¦' Sudan Poisoning Sudan grass has no equal in furnishing feed during the hot dry months of July, August* and even September. Some difficulty, ; however, has been encountered from livestock poisoning as a result of pasturing sudan grass. We have found in our work in connection with the Pasture Contest that relatively few people have lost cattle from sudan grass poisoning, although losses in some cases have been heavy. The problem is one about which we know relatively little and one on which much more work needs to he done. However, j the following suggestions, as presented by Mr. R. L. Gushing at the 1 State Pasture Clinic held at Omaha on November 9, are worthy of con - j sideration: ! ' 1. Use only seed the purity and source of which you are familiar i .with or use seed certified by the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association. 2. Do not turn into the pasture too soon. Let the grass get ¦ •'--. a good start, ten or twelve inches- high before tm-ning in. !! 3. Hungry animals and animals in poor condition seem to be more j susceptible to the poisoning. Give your stock a good fill of hay or |. grain before turning on to the pasture the first time. . j 4. Once the livestock is on the pasture, do not take them off, : even though the pasture gets short and you think it needs a rest. ; The best way to handle this is to rotate the animals through several areas. This never takes them off of the grass and yet gives the pasture intervals in which to recuperate. </seg>

There are still other reasons why we need to give particular thought to Pasture-Forage-Livestock problems at this time. These are based on the impetus given to increased acreage of hay and pasture forage crops which is coming about as a result of several national programs. The Soil Conservation Service is encouraging the seeding down of portions of farms badly eroded or so steep that erosion is a serious factor. The Agricultural Conservation Program, through benefit payments, is resulting in increased legume and grass seedings on many Nebraska farms. Not only does this program en - courage the use of permanent grasses and legumes, but to comply with regulations means that many farmers plant temporary pasture crops such as sudan, sorghums, and sweet-clover. The Land Planning Section has recommended that approximatey 2V. million acres now being tilled in this state should, be permaently returned to grass. This increased acreage of forage crops will mean some adjustment in farm management plans on the individual farms, particularly from ; :,-; the standpoint of livestock production. It may mean a shift in the number of livestock, the way the livestock is produced and fed out, or even in the type of stock—in all cases varying with the individual ¦ farm.. . • In view of these changed conditions on Nebraska farms, it seems that a general Pasture-Forage-Livestock Program, to replace the Pasture Contest is very logical at this time. Details have not been worked out, but procedure in the new program will undoubtedly | be similar to that'followed in the Pasture Contest. Farmers will be invited to participate much as they have been entering the Pasture Contest. Records will be kept not only on pasture land but on the ''entire livestock-roughage set-up. Such records will be assembled and ' summarized in the fall of the year and outstanding achievements • ¦ brought-to the attention of other farmers in the state.

However, experience has shown that varieties react very differently when grown on different soils under different climatic conditions. Therefore, to be able to make correct varietal recommendations for the various sections of the state, it is necessary to conduct many tests to determine which varieties can best be grown injthe different regions. Cooperation of the Experiment Sta - tion, Extension Service, County Agricultural Agents, County Farm ¦.. Bureaus, and representative farmers has made such tests possible. Manyj factors such as earliness, height, leafiness, strength of stalk, color of seed, forage quality, drought resistance, insect re - sistance, and disease resistance enter into the selection of a variety of sorghum. The prime factor is the number of bushels of sound palatable igravn, or the number of tons of high quality forage per acre that j the variety will yield. Therefore, a study of yields at the Experiment Station at Lincoln and yields in the cooperative tests will help show the possibilities of certain varieties. Grain Yields While tests with sorghums have been conducted at the station for many years, tests during the. past five years include several re - cently developed varieties that appear to be better adapted for pro - ducing grain under Nebraska conditions than many of the varieties tested earlier. The primary advantages of these newer varieties seem to be their ability to pass the critical heading period before the full impact of j drought and heat is felt, or to recover quickly after a 'drought period and thus mature grain before frost. ¦...";., Table 1.

District IV Foi] grain: Possibly the grain sorghums will be most often put to use in this region as a "catch crop". Some farmers in this district have suggested the possibility! of planting sorghum after rye pasture or after corn has been washed out late in the spring. Sooner milo and Early Kalo are the varieties best suited for these purposes. Kalo is satisfactory when planted early enough. Forj forage: As in district I, Atlas is unexcelled for forage. Over much of the region it can also be counted on to mature seed. Leoti is good as a midseason variety and Black Amber as an early one. Because a variety is not on the recommended list it should not be inferred (that it can not be grown. On the basis of yield tests and observations, those varieties on the recommended list are the most logical choices for the district for which they are recommended. From the data presented, it can be seen that not all varieties of sorghum are adapted to Nebraska. It can also be seen that a variety may be adapted to one part of the state but not to others. This means, then, that the first step in the successful production of sorghum for grain or, forage is the choosing of the best variety for the place it is to be grown. . ¦ | ¦¦ :.' ¦¦¦: '¦.. :". ¦ ¦ The | data also show that adapted varieties of grain sorghum can usually be depended on to produce more grain than corn and that this is' especially true in years when drought and heat make growing conditions unfavorable. The fact that the better varieties of forage sorghums can be counted on to produce approximately twice as much forage as corn is an important one for Nebraska farmers to remember. DO SORGHUMS INJUEE THE SOIL ? _l'd. WELDON It has been observed that crops do not yield as well after sorghum as after corn. This observation has led to the widespread belief that sorghum jis "hard on the land." Sorghum does not always depress the yield of the succeeding crop, however, and it is well to find out if we can, the fundamental reason for the depression when it does occur, to j understand the circumstances that determine whether or not a crop grown after sorghum will yield less than after corn or small grain, and to learn what can be done about it. Several theories have been advanced .as to why sorghum is "hard on the land." Since sorghum is well known to develop considerable </seg>

The solution of this problem is. of course, moisture conservation. 1 </seg>
         <seg id="p203">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association In the production of sorghum as well as other crops, we must put forth every effort to reduce to j a minimum the losses of rainfall by run-off J evaporation, and weed growth, and conserve for the use of the crop every available drop of water. -.-...:-.- Moisture is probably the most important factor that limits crop yields after sorghum, but it is not the only one. Even if sorghum ground jis irrigated, it will frequently be less productive than other irrigated land. The explanation is soil fertility. There are two prob - lems involved; one of them has to do with nitrogen and the other with elements of fertility, such as phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and so forth. The nitrogen situation is similar to what occurs when straw i. plowed under. Sorghum is rich in sugar and other carbohydrates and low in nitrogen. When sorghum residues are mixed with the soil, the! bacteria and fungi use them as food. They also need nitrogen, and sinjie there is insufficient nitrogen in the sorghum to supply their needs, they use whatever nitrogen is available in the soil. They com - pete wifh the growing crop for available nitrogen, and naturally the crop suffers. If the lowering of the yield of crops following sorghum is caused by nitrbgen deficiency, then the application of nitrogenous fertilizer should overcome the effect of the sorghums. This has been found to be the case on irrigated land or on dry land in favorable seasons. Furthermore, legumes on sorghum ground generally do as well as on any other ground, provided there is enough moisture, because legumes get their nitrogen from the air. The nitrogen problem, then, is a tem - porary one, and can be handled just as it would be in any other case. The deficiency can be avoided by the judicious use of legumes and manure to maintain a satsfactory organic matter and nitrogen supply. Removal of Mineral Elements The removal of phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, and other ele - ments of soil fertility by sorghum in larger quantities than by most other crpps except legumes can be largely compensated if we under - stand and apply the principles involved. Sorghum production means livestock feeding, and the livestock make it easier to restore the soil fertility [removed by the sorghum. Proper sanitation around the barns and yards and proper storage and use of the manure and bedding will return to the soil one-fourth to one-half of the fertility removed by the feed crop, and what is returned is in a much more active, available form than what is _ft in the soil. Sorghum production may cause a temporary lowering of soil fertility, but sound management practices made possible by increased livestock production will eventually result in greater soil fertility and productivity. One more effect of sorghum on the soil should be mentioned before </seg>

Averaging the results obtained from fattening pigs six months and older, we have for the College farm an average per year per acre of 454 pounds of pork from kaffir corn and 402 pounds of pork from corn. In the western half pf the state the difference in favor of kaffir corn is much greater; as in 1897, in fields where corn yielded 1 to 5 bushels per acre, the yield of kaffir corn was 25 bushels." That; the grain sorghums should be somewhat similar to corn in fattening- qualities is not surprising since they resemble corn in their chemical! make-up. Some of the grain sorghums are also about as palatable to livestock as corn. However, they differ significantly among themselves with respect to palatability.For example, at the Kansas Station Aubel and Connell found that when pigs were fed individually, each given free choice of nine varieties of sorghum grain, their order of preference for the grains was as follows: red kafir, Wheatland milo, dwarf milo, Atlas, Feterita, pink kafir, Blackhull, Kalo, and early sumac. Variations in tannin content doubtless explain these differences in palatability. . Grinding Is Important As a general rule, the grain sorghums should be ground for all classes of livestock; except sheep. The results of some recent Texas experiments indicate that grinding may not be necessary when grain sorghums are self-fed to hogs. The reason for this probably lies in the fact that hogs eat more leisurely, hence chew their feed better when grain is before them all of the time. There is no advantage gained by soaking either the threshed grain or the ground heads for hogs.; ¦ That ground sorghum grain has a higher feeding value than whole sorghum grain for fattening calves was demonstrated in the test con - ducted by J. M. Jones of the Texas Station. Steer calves fed ground threshed milo gained 48 pounds per head more in 180 days than on unground threshed milo. They also required 103 pounds less grain for 100 pounds gain than did those fed whole kafir. It should be said, however, that hogs followed these steers, and recovered much of the grain not! digested by the calves. The hog gain per steer was 100 pounds where unground threshed milo was fed and only 26 pounds per steer where ground threshed milo was fed. Similar results were obtained in a comparison of unground milo heads and ground milo heads. Calves fed ground milo heads made larger gains; were fatter at the conclusion of the experiment, and sold at a higher price. Their dressed yield was 60 per cent while those fed the unground milo heads yielded only 57 per cent. Furthermore, the steers fed ground. milo heads required 152 pounds less grain </seg>

It would seem that other grain sorghums including Atlas grain would have approximately the same values as kafir. At the Kansas Station Aubel and Alexander found ground Atlas sorgo grain to be worth 93.5 per cent as much as corn. In this test the ground Atlas sorgo was palatable for the daily consumption was greater than for corn. In another test,at the Kansas Station ground feterita proved equal to corn for fattening pigs while the relative values of ground milo and ground kafir compared with corn were 93 and 89 per cent respec - tively. On the average, the data obtained at various agricultural experiment stations indicate definitely that ground grain sorghums are worth about 90 per cent as much per pound as corn for fattening ¦hogs.' '.'"'.'¦' 7 However, for hogging down, corn is worth considerably more than kafir. In a test at the Kansas Station it was quite evident that a con - siderable amount of kafir was wasted in a field that was hogged down. The smal grains apparently were responsible for most of this wastage. Rating ornat 100 per cent in this test, kafir was worth only 73 per cent. ' Grain Sorghums for Lambs Kesuits with the grain sorghums for fattening lambs have varied somewhat in different tests, but in general these grains have been worth 90 per cent or more as much as corn pound for pound. Most authori - ties are inclined to rate shelled corn, milo, kafir, feterita, darso, and Atlas about the same for fattening lambs. In a test at the Kansas Station Cox and Connell found ground wheat worth approximately 15 per cent jmore than ground Atlas grain when fed with ground Atlas fodder and cottonseed meal to fattening lambs. In preliminary tests supervised by Cox and Wagner at the Garden City Branch of the Kansas Station, dwarf yellow milo and Wheatland milo were about equal when fed to lambs. The seeds of the sweet sorghm_, usually referred to as cane seed, are worth' considerably less than the grain sorghums as a feed for live - stock. Cane seed is not especially palatable, probably because of its tannin content. The seeds are smaller, harder, and somewhat lower in total digestible nutrients than the grain sorghums. Ground sweet sorghum seed is worth approximately 60 per cent as much per pound as corn for fattening cattle, 67 per cent for fattening hogs, and approxi - mately 80 per cent for fattening lambs. Sumac grain proved to be approximately equal to milo in a 110 day lamb fattening test conducted by Cox and Wagner at the Garden City Branch of the Kansas Agri - cultural Experiment Station. </seg>

         <seg id="p209">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association When we asked Nebraska farmers a year or so ago what they thought should be considered in the A.AA. Program the one topic which was most often mentioned was the condition of our pastures and the need for improvement of our grass land in Nebraska. We attempted in the 1937 Program to do something about it. We.admit that our efforts have not been entirely satisfactory, but we are looking forward to the next year's Program and expect to offer encouragement through the rulings and payments to the man who will defer grazing or rest their pastures and also to the man who wishes to seed and use either permanent or temporary pasture crops on his farm. In the discussion at our meetings which are being held at the present time and at those meetings which undoubtedly will be held in January, February, and March, the foundation will be laid for the execution of statements of intentions of farmers and their committeemen. In each of these state - ments of intentions the pasture problem will undoubtedly be discussed, and in many cases the farmer will plan to do what should be done with his grass land. I '".;.-. Forage Crops Important In our past programs we have tried to recognize the importance of good livestock forage feeds, and in each of the drouth years we have made provisions in our Program for; cooperating farmers to produce emergency livestock feed on.the acreage which they did not plant to the principal grain crops like wheat and corn. We could cite many instances of farmers taking advantage of these drouth modifica - tions and producing.enough roughages to carry their livestock thru the winter. In the 1937 Program the administration recognized the short - age of legume and.grass feed supplies and permitted emergency for - age crops like sudan, cane for forage,' small grain pastures, and hay to be used to meet some of the requirements of the Programs. In other words, if it had not been possible for farmers to plant part of their, acreage to such crops, very few of them would have been able to comply and receive their money in 1937. We are hoping that the 1938 Program will recognize the fact that it has been extremely difficult for us to obtain stands of legumes and grasses, that we have lost a large acreage of native grass pastures and that we are very short of livestock feed in this state. More than half of the acreage in Nebraska has been devoted to the production of grass and livestock forage feeds and it is possible to take silage and emergency forage crops off of a considerable acre - age of the cropland in the state. The Agricultural Conservation Pro - gram will encourage a decrease in the acreage devoted to the prin - cipal grain crops and also an increase in the acreage devoted to grasses, legumes, and other forage feeds in the future. Nebraska has always been a livestock state, and it is commonly known that three- </seg>

         <seg id="p211">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association the farmers- who are trying to work out this problem. There may be individual farms and small areas in the state where the production and sale of livestock is not the most important item on the farms, but for the state as a whole, there is no question but that the final result of, all of our agricultural conservation and price stabilization will be obtained through a pasture-forage-livestock program. HOW MUCH PASTURE AND FORAGE CAN WE AFFORD TO GROW? ; P. '_.- STEWART The wording of my subject indicates that those who prepared the program had the feeling that there were crops other than forages and pastures that would pay better. There is a hint in the topic that we lose in growing forages and pastures and the question implies—how much can we afford to lose? In other words, the implication is that there are crops other than forages and pastures that make us more [money, yet we should grow grass and roughage to some extent. lam inclined to.believe that we might reverse the question and ask—How much grain can we afford to grow? OIL ' 1 . ' There is no single answer to this question, word it as we may. Tell me the size of the farm you operate, the kind or type of soil you till, the topography of the land, your location in the state as rela-. ted to average rainfall, the length of the growing season and hot winds, and what type of farming you like to carry on and know something about, and then we might arrive at a fairly definite and sound answer as to the proper forage and pasture acreage for your farm unit. Even then we would have to know whether you are an owner-operator or tenant, something about the value of the land and just what annual or semi-annual payments on taxes, principal and interest must be made. What I am trying to say is this. There are many factors to be considered in setting up a plan for crop acreages. The answer would have to be on a case basis. A blanket recommendation cannot be made. "-!¦!. ." If the landlord of a farm insists on an immediate and annual maximum cash income, the tenant, of course, is prevented from putting any great ]acreage into grasses and. forages. There are also numerous tenants and owner-operators who have been hard hit by drouth and who have had to market much, and in some cases all, of their livestock on account of a lack of feed and to pay certain debts. These men, for a great part, unfortunately now have little if any credit to finance the purchase of livestock and hence they have little immediate use for pasture and quantities of roughages. We have in such instances a vicious cycle—no livestock because of a scarcity of feed and now no use for feed because of a scarcity of livestock. </seg>

What has happened to the values on these farms in a period of less than 20 years and in some cases, in the last 10 years? Here are a few typical examples, selected.at random, of the past and present value of some farms in this area. (See Table 1.) Reasons for Reduced Land Values ¦".:.' The general decline in the value of farm lands, of course, will account for a part of the price reduction. However, a comparison with other areas shows a very much greater land price; decline in this, erosion-injured area.

         <seg id="p215">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association and provide a cash crop to care for threshing costs whereas wheat could not be recommended as a major income enterprise. Livestock: Grazing type of livestock should constitute the nucleus of the farm unit as being best adapted to utilize the production one year with another besides being considered the most ad - ¦ vantageous income source. The fattening of livestock units should be flexible with the production of concentrates and at the same time permit reasonable carry-overs. In most instances cattle were preferred because of inadequate fencing. Six brood sow litters were considered sufficient. The bulk of the income should be obtained from the sale of livestock and livestock products. Those farmers who had grassland together with forage were in the most substantial condition. Not a single strictly grain farmer was found in the group. Stabilizing Agriculture I believe that we can conclude that grass and forage add to the stability of farming and subject, of course, to the quality of manage - ment exercised by the operator, provide a greater and most stable net income. It is also interesting and, I believe, very important to note that altho the loans these 16 men had were, on the average, on units of 172 acres they were actually operating farm units averaging 441 acres in size. ; ¦'¦;.- In certain areas we have been operating farms which are too small for well balanced units with the result that we, are not able to plan a proper balance between grain crops as against forage and pasture crops. Because these units are smaller than would be "ideal" we are often forced to cultivate slopes that we know should be in per - manent grass. What grass to use and how to get it started on such acres is still a live and important problem. Refer back for a minute to the area I discussed as having been greatly injured by erosion. What is the ultimate answer? The same, I feel, as in parts of the Great Plains—somewhat larger units, a better balance between grass and cultivated land, with livestock as the main source of in - come.- .-'.': I have now discussed the three general principles which I feel are the most important phases of my subject. Let me remind you again of the several points that I mentioned in the beginning which must be kept in mind in applying these principles to any one par - ticular farm. I well realize that to state these principles and to put them into action on an individual farm are two entirely different things. At the present time many farmers recognize that they should do certain things but they are powerless to do it. A few, of course, </seg>

They have been found to be inexpensive of construction and quite satisfactory from the standpoint of holding feed until needed. . Their big advantage lies in low cost per ton storage capacity and ease of increasing size or numbers to care for all feed which it seems desriable to store. In Fat Years Get Ready for Lean Ones There is a good deal of clamor now for an ever normal granary. I believe the. cattle and sheep man can get his business on an ever normal basis by providing himself with a liberal ensilage capacity and in good years .filling to the maximum. The history of market trends would tend to justify such action. To illustrate, in 1932 we raised a bumper crop of corn. This sold at from 10 to 15 cents per bushel during' most of the winter following. Had the farmers of Nebraska as well as other states scraped holes in the ground and in the fall of 1932. buried 10 per cent of their bumper crop of ensilage, I am inclined to .think they would have received enough more per bushel for the remainder to have brought the same total number of dollars to their coffers and in addition would have had a large amount of highly desirable feed stored in their silos. That this would have proven valuable, when the 1934 drought hit goes without saying, Were part of it not used then, it could have been used in the drought years which!have intervened between 1934 and 1937. History Will Repeat We will have recurrences of. such conditions. There will be years of plenty when as one man said a few years ago, "We are swim - ming in roughage." Under these , conditions there should be some means of encouraging wholesale cutting and storing of ensilage. The advantages would far overshadow the disadvantages. Unfor - tunately, many people become discouraged in eras of low priced feed. They fail to look ahead a few years to the possible radical change which will take place in supply and demand. Nebraska Must Get on a Long-Time Basis We have been too much on the one-year basis in Nebraska. Possibly our one-year lease has been to a considerable extent respon - sible. I predict that when landlord and tenant can get together on a five- or fen-year basis, problems like the one which I mention will be settled much more satisfactorily. , I believe there is hope to be derived from encouraging a crop diversification program which will enable the stockman to produce a considerable acreage of crops other than those commonly thought of as major in importance.

We can best meet these by being on our toes at all times and endeavoring to anticipate what our problems may be. . Livestock Income Determines Our Prosperity Nebraska is a livestock state. This statement has been made so many times that most of you folks are probably tired of hearing it and yet our past, our present, and our future depends upon the livestock business. The income of Nebraska is not materially affected whether corn be 20 cents or $1.00 per bushel, whether alfalfa be $6.00 or $16.00 per ton, whether oats be '20 cents or 40 cents per bushel. The thing that ticks with us is the price which we receive for fat cattle, hogs, lambs, butter, eggs and poultry. These are the products which we produce from the grasses and crops produced out of our fertile soil. The livestock dollar is the determining dollar insofar as Nebraska is concerned and not infrequently the livestock man who has fortified himself to meet adverse climatic conditions finds his best going during and immediately succeeding periods of adversity. HARVESTING, STORING/GRADING HYBRID SEED CORN ED STECKLEY, Weeping Water Every year seems to bring a. new problem for the man who produces hybrid seed corn. The year of 1935 was no exception, with a very wet late spring and a wet fall climaxed with an early killing frost. This shows the need for an ear corn dryer. I had some 35 acres of hybrid and the corn looked nice but was very wet. Before it could be picked the frost came and the germination was very badly damaged. '• I: tried to dry the corn by several different methods, none of which proved to be successful, and had to throw away about 1000 bushels as unfit for seed. The small amount left had a very low germination. This loss would have more than paid for a dryer. During the next spring I went into lowa and saw as many dryers as, possible. That fall we started the seed-house and built it to accommodate a dryer. We had plenty of time to complete the house by cold weather, since the drouth had finished most of the corn. This last summer the dryer was installed. It was not absolutely necessary to use it this fall. However, by doing so a great amount of time was saved and we eliminated all danger of losing the germination. The corn is dried on the ear by sending 3400 cubic feet of hot air per minute through the bins. This air is heated to .110 degrees. The dryer is divided into four bins with a total capacity of 650 bushels. The problem when shucking </seg>

Since I had to have men all night to operate the dryer I had them size corn, thereby saving a little in cost. Two men could size 150 bushels of corn and tend the dryer at the same time. They were on from six at night to six in the morning, when the day men would relieve them. This corn was sacked in two bushel sacks and labeled with the size for easy identification when it came time to be resized. !-¦" The grader was run at the rate of 15 bushels per hour, I have sized my: corn into five sizes, large round, small round, small flat, medium flat, and large flat. We decided on these sizes after going to Omaha and Lincoln, and putting each size through all the different makes of listers and planters that are in common use here in Nebraska. These five sizes make it possible to get 95 to 97 per cent accuracy in planting. After the first grading the corn is resized, one size at a time. This time, instead of running the grader at 15 bushels per hour it was run at 10 bushels pc .hour. Doing this gives a more uniform size kernel which the farmers will appreciate when it comes time to plant. At this time we sack in our one-bushel sacks printed with the size and variety. It is then ready for certification inspection and grading for quality. This is done by the Crop Growers' Association. It has been almost a continuous operation from shucking through the first grading, running 24 hours a day and seven days a week. DETASSELING FOR HYBRID SEED CORN PRODUCTION AMOS K. GRAMLICH, Ft. Crook __ ' ____. Detasseling of the female or ear plants ¦ for hybrid seed corn production is a simple task in itself but one that requires careful supervision and attention to details. Large scale commercial production requires very careful preparation prior to, and careful organization during the detasseling period. The problem of detasseling may well be divided into.five main subjects with numer - ous subdivisions under each one. These subjects are: (1) type of men to be used; (2) marking of the field; (3) when to start detasseling, (4) the job; and (5) machine detasseling. ' type of Man to be Used Amos K.

         <seg id="p223">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association Extreme watchfulness must be exercised on south slopes and low places in the field as it is here the first tassels and silks usually appear. Detasseling must start before the first silks appear which will be when approximately 10% of the tassels are ready to pull. Generally speaking it may be said that the silks appear about three to five days after the tassel emerges from the boot. It in - volves too much labor and damage to the plant if the tassels are pulled before they have emerged far enough. Both weather conditions and plant characteristics have bearing on the length of time between appearances of the tassels and the shoots, and also on the number of tassejs which are out before de - tasseling must be started. . 1 The male rows should be carefully rogued for off-type and volun - teer plants, before they come into tassel so that no undesirable pollen will be shed. The female rows can be rogued during detasseling. .-¦--.. . -- &lt;i. - .. ¦ •- "--. :"..'•: j- ;.;.! .The Job ¦"'¦'.'!•-'¦ The time has arrived and the men are on the job. The first thing in order is a short talk explaining the purposes of the job, the absolute necessity for thorough work, and rules of the field, such as "no talking", etc. After this each man is assigned a pencil and note book in which he.- records the identification number of each' pair of rows he detassels each day. On the notebook cover is his identification number by which he is identified throughout the season. On the stake tags of the rows he detassels, he is instructed to write the date and his identification number. By this method each man can be checked at any time during the day: At the end of each day his book is turned in to the supervisor who then notes how many rows have been completed. ! As a matter of convenience and sanitation each man is issued a numbered, cloth-covered, water jug. Twenty men to a crew are the maximum one supervisor can . handle and fifteen are better. In the field the men start down between their pairs of rows and are followed by the supervisor who inspects the thoroughness of each man's work. Some will pull the tassels before they have emerged far enough, and two or, more leaves may be removed with the tassel. This causes too much damage to the plant and will result in decreased yield. Others will miss tassels or will not take them close enough. This means danger from shedding pollen before the next daily detassel - ' ¦ ing. V- ;-;--- •¦-.!¦ - ¦:.. </seg>

At the end of about seven to ten days, every other day may suffice. Our Nebraska Certified kinds have a 2_2__ period of about three weeks.

As the men can ride in the shade and are up where they can be comfortable and have excellent vision, all their energy can be concentrated on pulling tassels. It is possible to calculate almost the exact time required to cover a 100-acre field. An lowa producer who buys foundation stocks from this com - pany has constructed a horse drawn plank sled with a burlap canonv which has been very satisfactory. Much is yet to be learned about methods for detasseling large acreages. -.

In conclusion I feel that you will agree with me that detasseling is only one of the many expensive steps involved in producing good hybrid seed.. It is particularly complicated because of the ve_ large number of men required at a specific time, regardless of weather conditions. Detasseling is man's mad race to prevent the indominab instinct of nature to reproduce itself in a natural way. ! MY j EXPERIENCE IN DETASSELING HENRY HEYNE, Wisner, Nebraska I have been detasseling corn' since 1933. First, I tried different ways, but.l found that the best way is just to go on foot and take one my at a time-especially with a bunch of inexperienced boys I have found that the.best way is to pull the tassel when it hangs out, somewhat as if you were holding your hand out with the fingers tight together and somewhat bent over. If you wait till the tassel stands up, then the pollen starts to fall and that is too late It £ n T0t. ie,t oUtas/ as;'y. either. I like to pull them pretty small. Then I feel | more safe than if I should let them get too far along Besides, they come out very easily that way. I have been going through the fields all the way from nine to fourteen times-it depends! a good deal on the weather. This year we had really ideal weather when we were detasseling, and we went </seg>
         <seg id="p226">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ¦ ' i through some fields nine times and some of them eleven times. Whether the nights are warm or cool makes quite a difference. In the' warm nights it makes more progress than in the cool ones. 1 start to detassel just before the first silks appear and keep right at it till it is all tasseled. If there are some late suckers, then we break them off so that they cannot spread any pollen. They will not produce an ear, anyway. Some have told me tnat they go through their fields only three or four times. I wish they would let me in on their secret—how they get Mother Nature to work for them. As I said before, this year was an ideal season in tasseling time. I cannot see how it could have been better. I found that it took around twelve to eighteen days for all the tassels to come out. You have to get them before they shed pollen so you have to go through at least twice in every three days. I find that it works very well to have your men in gangs of ' about twelve men and one foreman. If you take out larger gangs the foreman cannot watch close enough. We have each man take the : same row every time-then he will not shirk so readily, and you 7 or the foreman can check him better. I give the workers' a bonus if they stay the whole time. They do not want to lose their extra ' pay and consequently they will do better work. My chief difficulty ' was that they pulled too much fodder at first. However, after they had been working a few days they did better. THE RESULTS OF THE 1937 CORN HYBRID AND VARIETY TESTS VIRGIL H. WELCH : ; j The rather conservative attitude on the part of Nebraska farmers concerning the growing of hybrid corn on their farms seems to have 'I given way to one of keen interest and enthusiasm for this improved " i. kind of corn. With this increase in interest and the consequent in- % crease in the acreage planted to hybrids, there is a growing interest I evidenced in the Nebraska cooperative tests, for even with the effort I put forth on the part of institutions and seedsmen to produce better !| hybrids, it is still regarded as hazardous to purchase seed of a I hybrid without some previous knowledge of its behavior under our '. own conditions. The 1937 tests bear out the results of former years in il that they show some hybrids to be outstanding in their ability to I outyield the open-pollinated varieties; some to be only fair; and others low in yield, unadapted, and therefore unprofitable to grow. j Ttlis year's testing program included eight hybrid and variety I tests distributed through the eastern section of the state. Each test 1 consisted of 35 entries of which five were open-pollinated varieties, 1 21 commercial hybrids, and nine were experimental hybrids. Due to the V 'A </seg>

Of the 21 commercial hybrids tested this year, 15 were included for the first time so that the five Nebraska certified hybrids are the only commercial hybrids for which we have a record of performance over a period of years. Five of the eight Nebraska experimental hybrids were included for the first time and without the usual preliminary testing at the Experiment Station. The drouth of the past four years has resulted in failure of the preliminary Experiment Station tests. These tests were planned and conducted by the Experiment Station and the Extension Service in cooperation with the local county agent and the following farmers on whose farms the tests were located. Arch Hosterman Nemaha county Test planted May 10 Amos Gramlich .Sarpy county , Test planted May 11 J. C. Robinson Seed Co.

Roggenbach Wayne county Test planted May 20 Six of these tests survived the rather adverse season and were har - vested for yield, while those in Saline county:and Madison county were abandoned due to the severe effect of the drought and heat. Method of Planting In each test each entry was planted in four replications to offset the effect of soil variation. Planting was done by hand, five kernels being dropped ;in each hill to assure a full stand. After the first cultivation the stands were thinned, leaving two plants in each hill in two replications and three plants in each hill in the remaining two. </seg>
         <seg id="p228">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture This procedure was followed for all tests except that in Nemaha county where the stand was poor and it was necessary to thin all plats to two plants per hill to obtain a uniform stand for all entries. The plats were three rows wide and 20 hills long with the hills spaced 42 inches apart each way. At harvest yields were determined on 18 hills of the center row, thus discarding the border rows to avoid the unequal influence of larger or smaller corn on either side of any entry. The yields are calculated for shelled corn on a 14 per cent moisture basis and are the average of all four replications. One of the main purposes of these tests as well as similar tests which have been conducted for a number of years was to determine whether or not hybrids are enough superior to varieties to merit the purchase of hybrid seed for farm planting. And as the results in former years have proven, this year's results add assurance that certain hybrids are consistently outyielding varieties to a profitable extent. As an average for five years (Table 1), the five hybrids that are certified in Nebraska have averaged 17 per cent more grain than Krug, our standard eastern Nebraska variety.

A large number of farmers availed themselves of the opportunity to observe the various hybrids and varieties in the field in or near their com - munity throughout the summer and especially at the demonstration meetings held at the different tests early in the fall. 'In Table 3, we find that of the varieties, Roggenbach's Krug-Reid gave the highest yield as an average for all counties which was five per cent more than Krug, while Cattle Corn as in former years was the lowest-yielding variety with a yield of two per cent below Krug. Of the hybrids, 111. 960, a hybrid of the larger type from the Illinois Experiment Station, outyielded all other entries with a yield of 51.4 bushels of grain per acre which is 26 per cent above Krug. Considering all entries, the highest-yielding 27 were hybrids yet. there were three hybrids which yielded less than the best variety, which adds one more year's proof to the fact that some hybrids are not better than open - pollinated varieties.

To keep abreast with the public demand for information and as a result of past experence it would seem that more tests covering a larger area of our state and larger tests permitting more entries would be desirable, as only a portion of the state has been tested thoroughly to determine where hybrids can be profitably grown. Another prob - able result of these tests is that corn breeders and seed growers are given a better idea-of the type of corn required for the sections in which the tests were located In selecting a hybrid for farm planting a recoi. of its yield over a term of years is a much more reliable guide than a single year's record, for a variety that is relatively high in yield in 1937 may be so as a result of its reaction to the particular seasonal conditions existing this year and may not be so high in a season favoring other types. A hybrid which consistently gives a relatively high yield is the profitable one to grow. Hybrids which have not been tested in Nebraska, if grown at all, should be tried only on a small scale.

         <seg id="p233">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association or parent seed stocks is essential in a well managed commercial hybrid seed corn production program. The problem connected with the production of foundation seed stocks may perhaps be better understood after a brief consideration of the present status of hybrid corn and the experimental work required to establish superior com - mercial j combinations. Hybrids are classed as '"commercial" when their seed has been distributed for general production. As the name implies, hybrid seed corn is produced by crossing together j two or more unrelated foundation inbred lines. The various kinds of combinations may be classified as follows: (1) Single-cross hybrid, made by crossing two inbred lines. (2) Three-way hybrid, made by crossing an inbred line onto a single cross. (3) | Double-cross hybrid, made by crossing two single-cross hybrids. (4) -Multiple-cross hybrids, which may involve any number of lines beyond four, such as a cross between two double-cross hybrids. The ease of finding highly productive and desirable hybrids de - creases as the number of lines involved increases. However, in working with large numbers, equally productive single, 3-way, and double-cross hybrids are found. Commercial hybrid-seed producers in the Corn Belt have now almost universally standardized on the double cross for field corn production. It is highly productive and attractive, and the seed is more easily and cheaply produced on a large scale than with 3-way and single-cross hybrids. There is a great advanage in the crossing field to have the seed ears borne on a productive single - cross female or ear parent rather than on an inbred line. There is also a'greater abundance of pollen when the male or tassel parent is a hybrid rather than an inbred line. In the case of sweet corn in which maximum uniformity is an important asset, the single cross is used extensively for'commercial production. The five commercial field-corn hybrids that are certified in this state by the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association are all double crosses. In addition to. the standard forms of commercial hybrids men - tioned above, the top-cross is made by crossing an ordinary variety by an inbred line. This type of combination is regarded as not hav - ing the ultimate possibilities of the double cross. Commercial Hybrid Seed Must be of the First Generation With the extensive replacement of ordinary open-pollinated varie - ties by control-pollinated hybrids, an entirely new seed corn problem arises. The simple practice of picking seed ears from the commercial crop grown for feed or for market cannot be followed by the grower who wishes to realize the full possibilities of hybrid corn. Hybrid seed picked in this way would produce a Becond generation progeny </seg>
         <seg id="p234">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture which is definitely inferior to a first generation crop. Although hybrids differ somewhat in the extent of their reduction in the second generation, it amounts to an average of about 17 per cent lower grain yield for such commercial double-cross hybrids as are planted in this state. Representative three-way hybrids reduce about 25 per cent and single crosses about 34 per cent in the second generation. More - advanced generations, as the third and fourth, continue to yield the same as the second if the seed is produced under isolation and is picked in bulk without selection. Therefore, in order to maintain the high superiority of hybrid corn it is necessary to avoid picking seed from the commercial hybrid crop and instead to use first generation seed anew every year. This recommendation is not made to provide a graft, as is sometimes stated, for the commercial seed grower who thereby gets an oppor - tunity to sell seed to his customers every year. It is strictly in accordance with biological principles, and any farmer who violates these deprives himself of the possibility of a maximum yield. These principles have been so firmly established that the legislatures of Nebraska and many other states have made it illegal to offer for sale second generation seed as hybrid seed corn. Adaptation of Hybrids If we are to be the most successful with our crop, we must keep before us as a cardinal principle the fact that hybrid corn is not just hybrid corn, but that there are many different hybrids which differ greatly as to suitability, productivity, and desirability for any particular locality. We should come to know hybrids by their specific number or name and through experience acquire knowledge as to their individual adaptation and performance. There is too much at stake in the business of farming to take chances with the suitability of the seed that is planted. It is not asking too much of a hybrid that it be relatively resistant to drouth, heat, and lodging; high in yield and quality of grain; relatively free of suckers; and attractive and reasonably uniform as to plant type. The ears should be placed at a convenient height for husking, and they should be well covered with husks and have shanks strong enough to prevent falling to the ground when ripe. A 15 per cent higher yield of adapted, productive hybrids qver standard varieties is expected over a period of years. - . - In Nebraska, the superiority of recognized hybrids has become estab - lished only in about the eastern fourth of the state and in the irrigated sections of the central west. It is hoped that suitable and profitable hybnds may also be established for the dry-land farms of central and western Nebraska. Fairly extensive tests will be made in those regions this coming year.

When the characteristics and productivity of any specific hybrid have once been established for a locality, it may be expected to continue unchanged in its inheritance so long as the seed stocks are kept pure and the commercial seed is properly produced. Under such conditions it should be immaterial where or under what conditions the seed of any specific hybrid is produced, provided a good quality of seed is obtained. When seed is purchased, the integrity of the pro - ducer and official seed certification may serve to verify its identity. ¦ 7; . • Origin of Commercial Hybrids The preliminary work of developing and testing corn hybrids is that of specialized corn breeders, either private or public. Equally good hybrids may be originated by either source. There is one real difference of practical import when it comes to the commercial production of hybrid seed—the publicly produced foundation seed stocks of commercial hybrids are available to any citizen who wishes to engage in hybrid seed production, whereas the privately developed seed stocks are privately owned and controlled and are usually avail - able to others, if at all, only on some royalty basis. All hybrid corn is characterized by being a hybrid recombination of inbred lines which have been isolated from ordinary corn by suc - cessive controlled inbreeding for a number of generations. The in - breeding, accompanied by selection of the best plants in each genera - tion, establishes: the so-called basic or foundation lines from which the hybrids are composed by crossing. These lines become very uni - form as to plant type and inheritance, and, for all practical pur - poses, transmit the same characteristics to their offspring year after year, and wherever the seed may be produced. It is typical of inbred lines to yield far less than the, ordinary varieties from which they originate, and' therefore in themselves have no practical value. The best of them seldom yield more than half a3 much as the original variety after they have been self-fertilized for about six generations and their inheritance has become virtually stabilized. Many lines are very.'inferior in various respects which make them unsuitable for commercial hybridization, and they are dropped from further production. ':'.' . ¦:. : ¦ The actual value of the lines retained" for experimental hybridiza - tion can be determined only by trial. Of a large number of initial crosses made by the corn breeder, relatively few are found out - standing when subjected to comparative field performance tests. But </seg>
         <seg id="p236">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture if the work is sufficiently extensive, some superb crosses usually materialize. The outstanding commercial and experimental hybrids are not just haphazard crosses between inbred lines but are specific com - binations between certain lines. Whenever one or more lines are substituted in a hybrid it becomes a different hybrid. The character of the hybrid depends upon the inheritance it receives from its parent or foundation seed stocks. When only two lines enter into ! a cross, the character and productivity of the hybrid is normally not affected by a reversal of their use as male and female parents. But when three or more lines are involved the hybrid may be greatly affected by the way the lines are brought into the cross. For example the double-cross hybrid (a x b) x (c x d) may be quite different from (a x c) x (b x d). Thus in any given double-cross hybrid, it is not only necessary that the same four lines are always em- s ployed, but also that the two single-cross parents are always com- :'i prised of the same two respective lines. While ordinarily it would make no material difference in the ' genetic constitution of the commercial seed, which of the two specified single-cross parents is used as the female, it may make a material difference in such items as appearance and size of the seed, ease and cost of detasseling, and yield of seed per acre in the crossing field. For such reasons it is advisable for a commercial grower to combine the foundation seed stocks exactly as prescribed until he is fully con - vinced from further experimenting that a change is permissible. Release of Commercial Hybrids When the Experiment Station has become convinced through its various tests that some new hybrid is sufficiently superior to the best J already distributed, the seed stocks needed for its production may be ]] released to the public. This can of course be done only when the . inbred lines involved have been developed by the home station or by some other state or federal station. There is a general co- :! operative understanding among the various experiment stations that . inbred lines developed by one may be released to another for use in ' . commercial production. When the foundation lines of a new commercial hybrid are dis - tributed, it is with the expectation that they will be used in pro - ducing the new hybrid according to the recommended pedigree. Maintenance of Foundation Seed Stocks The foundation or parent seed stocks of any commercial hybrid consist of those basic lines and hybrids that are required in the pro - duction of the commercial seed itself. As an illustration, the parent </seg>
         <seg id="p237">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association seed stocks of any specific double-cross hybrid are comprised of the four foundation inbred lines and the two foundation single crosses which enter into its makeup. The continued uniform performance of any commercial hybrid depends upon the faithful maintenance of the identity and purity of its foundation seed stocks. The commercial grower of hybrid seed may either produce his own foundation seed or he may purchase part or all of it. Whoever produces it, the general procedure is the same. Inbred lines.—When seed of an inbred line has been released for use in commercial seed production, its seed supply is commonly main - tained in quantity by .growing alone in an isolated increase field in which open pollination is permitted. Such seed is said to be sister - bred, the I silks being pollinated by sister plants. This practice is essentially equivalent to inbreeding. An; arbitrary distance of 40 rods isolation from-other corn is recommended. j - .'.. . .'." ¦.¦...' .'.:•'.....:.. .

A modification of this mode of increasing seed of an inbred line is to grow) it as the male or tassel parent in a crossing field in which the female or ear parent is kept thoroughly detasseled. Insofar as the ear parent is not permitted to shed pollen the seed produced by the tassel parent is as pure as if it had been grown alone under strict isolation. Because of the danger of contamination from im - perfect detasseling, this mode of increase for more than one or two generations should be discouraged. </seg>

' 7 Roguing off-type plants and ears.—lt is a very important aid in maintaining the purity and identity of parent seed stocks to thoroughly examine the growing plants and harvested ears and discard all those whose truenessi to type is at all questioned. No matter how great the effort to keep seed pure, there is almost always some contamination which does not become evident until the plants are growing in the field. The off-type plantsj are then pulled before the silking and tasseling period is reached. Qutcrosses or hybrids in an imbred line can usually be detected by their greater vigor and size. It is wise to be critical in this roguing procedure, even at the expense of destroying a fourth of the plants lif that seems necessary to remove all those that are doubtful. It is[ usually more difficult to distinguish off-type plants in the single-cross parents but they should be rogued nevertheless. '!/¦¦ Processing Foundation Seed ..'.-- i . - '-*'.¦ The seed lof parent seed stocks should be carefully graded and preserved! This will facilitate planting and insure better stands. Provision! should be made for harvesting in the fall before danger of freezing injury to the germination. Under large-scale production, artificial drying is often advantageous. The ears can then be worked over and shelled without prolonged delay. When emergency seed supplies are carried over for possible use in future years, protection, against mice and fumigation against insects may be necessary. .How Much Foundation Seed is Needed? A well planned commercial hybrid seed corn program anticipates the amount of foundation seed required for the acreage to be. planted. Arrangementsi are then made to produce or have produced the needed quantities of'the various stocks. It is every grower's business to look after his| own needs. For one seriously engaged in hybrid seed production, it is a very wise plan to keep on hand an extra year's supply of foundation seed as a safeguard against crop failure. As a convenient unit of production, figures may be based on 100 acres of double-crossing plat. While. it is not possible to estimate precisely the amount of seed required because of seasonal and heritable differences in kernel size, we may assume that a bushel of founda - tion seed will plant"eight acres. If planted in the proportion of four rows female to two rows male, 100 acres would require 8 bushels of the female seed and 4 bushels of the male. To provide this amount of seed from the parent inbred lines might require, under average conditions, one' acre to grow the four bushels male parent and two acres for the eight bushels of female parent. This </seg>
         <seg id="p240">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture assumes that the single-crossing fields will yield at the rate of eight bushels seed per acre, and being planted to alternate female and male rows, only half the crop will be foundation single-cross seed. To plant the one acre to produce the four bushels of foundation male would require about four pounds of each of the inbred parents. The two acres planted to make the eight bushels of foundation female seed would require about eight pounds of each of its two inbred parents. When it comes to the careful planning by each grower of his own seed stock requirements, the exact amount of seed can be calculated more precisely. Such calculations may be based on the mean weight of 1000 kernels of each required stock. The number of kernels per pound may vary from about 1000 to 2000 according to the line ¦and grade of seed. To summarize: For 100 acres of double-crossing field to be planted to a given double cross in 1940, there should be a one-acre and a two-acre crossing field in 1939. Seed for these two single-crossing fields in 1939 should be produced in 1938 to the extent of four pounds each of two of the inbred parents and ei_ht pounds each of the other two needed inbred parents. The seed of these four inbred lines should be pro - duced in such small quantity by the controlled bagging method without isolation. If several farmers would cooperate, each could advantageously produce part of the needed seed as few individual farmers can locate so many isolated crossing plats. If a total of 10,000 acres double-crossing plats are to be planted in Nebraska in 3940, we must multiply the foregoing figures by 100 in arriving approximately at the state's needs. That would mean 300 acres of single-crossing fields in 1939 for which 2,400 pounds or about 43 bushels of inbred parent seed should be produced in 1938. Correspond - ing- production should be carried out in each succeeding year. The seed stocks production would actually be more complicated than appears from these calculations because there will be a number of different commercial hybrids under production, each requiring its own set of seed stocks. In planning the acreage devoted to seed stocks production, con - sideration should be given to probable needs, all possible hazards, and individuality of the different foundation stocks. Who Should Produce Foundation Seed? Persons engaged in the various phases of hybrid corn production fall into the following classes: 1. The commercial grower of hybrid corn. 2. The grower of commercial hybrid seed </seg>
         <seg id="p241">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association 3. The grower of foundation single-cross seed stocks for commer - cial hybrid seed production. 4 . The grower of foundation inbred lines for use in foundation single-cross seed production. 5. The breeder who develops new inbred lines and hybrids. Some persons may wish to engage in more than one of these activities; some only in one, and some in all. Many factors should be considered in determining the extent of one's program. It is certain that every hybrid corn grower will not wish to produce his own seed, and that every commercial hybrid seed-corn producer will not wish to raise his own foundation seed stocks. Some of them will wish to produce their own foundation single crosses but not the required foundation inbreds. Few men have the needed isolation and other facilities for producing all of these needed seed stocks. Per - sonal temperament is also a factor. Within it all, there seems to be much opportunity for specialization and private enterprise. The maintenance and production of many different foundation lines and single crosses can easily occupy the interests and time of several trained specialists who are located, under favorable corn-growing conditions. Some of this specialized production may take the form of private business enterprise, while some of it may be carried on as a cooperative project among interested farmers. If the number of cooperators is sufficiently large each seed stock may be in - creased on several different farms, thereby reducing the risk of complete failure. Careful planning is needed to insure the needed supply of every parent stock and. at the same time to avoid wasteful overproduction. In Ohio, an association of seed corn growers known as the Ohio Hybrid Seed Corn Producers has been formed for the purpose of growing needed seed stocks for the members. -.-.-.-..¦'¦ ¦.'¦'-.. .. • '-.'-.-'- i Inbred lines are commonly more sensitive to unfavorable conditions as excessive heat and drouth than is ordinary corn, and failure of seed production is often experienced. This makes it |a rather questionable practice to .undertake or depend on the extensive production of foundation inbred and single-cross seed stocks in Nebraska except in the more humid sections or perhaps under j irrigation elsewhere. Some Nebraska growers have even considered haying their seed stocks produced in some other states by qualified growers located where tem - perature and moisture conditions are more congenial and crop fail - ures seldom occur. This is especially easily I arranged when the needed seed stocks are also used in the hybridsi of the other states, as for example, lowa 939 which is extensively produced in lowa and Ohio as well as Nebraska. Whatever the procedure, there is need for initiative on the part of every hybrid seed corn producer to assure a supply of seed, stocks. It is poor business! policy to just "trust to luck" in so important a matter. .¦.¦:.:¦...-¦'.. .."¦-; '.-¦¦¦ ¦'-....-¦¦ v... - -! ! 7 ; :;¦! :¦, I ! ' </seg>
         <seg id="p242">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Seed Stocks Available for 1938 Fortunately, in spite of four consecutive years of drouth, Nebraska seed corn producers have enough certified foundation seed stocks on hand to plant about 3,500 acres of crossing fields in 1938 for the production of Nebraska certified commercial hybrid seed of four hybrids. To provide this quantity it has been necessary, however, for the State Seed Certification Committee to admit the use of second - generation seed of some stocks. A list of growers having certified foundation seed stocks for sale is available. In addition to these Nebraska grown stocks, it appears that there is a surplus of the certified seed stocks of lowa 939 in lowa, and that it will be possible to purchase any additional needed amount in that state. There is less seed than wanted of some of the foundation lines and hybrids. This situation should be remedied by constructive action of the producers themselves. The Agricultural College can at best grow only small quantities to serve as a source for renewal of com - mercial foudation seed stocks. THE NEED FOR SOIL CONSERVATION DISTRICTS D. L. GROSS Somewhat les: than one-half of the land area in Nebraska is under cultivation. Normally about 20,000,000 acres are classed as rota - tion land. Of this, about one-tenth or approximately 2,000,000 acres are on land that is unfit for tillage and should be returned to grass or trees. Of the remaining eighteen million acres about 13,500,000 acres ..'!.; ore on nearly level land that is not subject to severe water erosion. Where poorly managed it may be damaged by wind erosion. The other 4,500,000 acres are on rolling land that is being subjected to '¦-' serious water erosion. The greater portion of this land is in eastern Nebraska where rainfall is greatest and where production is potentially high. It is from this area that the greater portion of Nebraska's wealth has come. For this reason Nebraska needs to give serious consideration to its water erosion problems. Fortunately, water erosion has not progressed to the same ex- [': tent in Nebraska as in states to the east and south. The land in Nebraska has been farmed for a lesser number of years, the rainfall is ' ¦ lower, and the soils generally have greater resistance to erosion than those in the east and south. Notwithstanding these factors, how - ever, erosion has progressed extensively in Nebraska and is accelerating from year to year. Much land that was once fertile has already eroded to the extent that it is no longer fit for tillage. The addi - tional acreage falling into this class each year is becoming steadily greater. The removal or thinning of the absorbent top soil accounts </seg>
         <seg id="p243">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association for this increase. Run-off from cultivated fields is becoming greater. With each increase in run-off the tonnage of soil removed increases. Not All Soils Erode Alike The rolling land of Nebraska is not all composed of the same material. That of much of southeastern Nebraska is made of material deposited by glaciers in prehistoric time. The soils are quite variable in type and contain varying amounts of gravel and boulders. The loess hills on the other hand, lying in northeastern, north central, and southern Nebraska, with a fringe along the Missouri river in south - eastern Nebraska, are formed largely by silty material supposedly deposited by the wind at a time when little vegetation existed. This material generally is quite deep, very porous, and absorbs water rapidly. In contrast, soils formed on the glacial material are quite generally of a finer texture, particularly in their subsoils, and absorb rainwater much more slowly. Damage from erosion is for this reason much more extensive in the glacial hills than on the loess. - Gulty erosion is more serious and the loss of top soil often exposes an unproductive, tight material that is not easily brought into profitable production. The loss of top soil on the loess is less serious since the underlying material absorbs water rapidly and can be brought into a state of high productivity rather quickly by the judicious use of legumes and manure. Because of lower runoff from the loess soils, and- because- of -their^columnar structure which tends to resist erosion, gully erosion advances less rapidly in loessial areas. j 'Slope Influences Erosion Notwithstanding the nearly ideal 1 material upon which the loess soils are formed, the loessal areas have an erosion problem not found to the same extent in the glacial hill area. This problem has to do with slope. The degree of slope in the loess hills is. much higher than in most other areas. This favOrs a rapid loss of top soil when rainfall is intense. The maintenance of fertility, particularly organic matter or nitrogen, is a difficult problem. Fertility added to the soil by legumes and manures is quickly lost on the steep slopes through sheet erosion. Erosion control practices on such slopes are difficult to devise if the land is to remain in tilled crops. Erosion Control Practices Control of erosion in Nebraska is not practiced extensively. Row crops commonly are planted parallel to fence lines or field boundaries with no regard to slope direction. Consequently, rows on most fields lead directly down the slope. This greatly enhances runoff and soil loss. Field draws are commonly plowed in each spring, thereby in - creasing their depth and the slopes which lead into. them. This practice has permitted erosion to the extent that many fields have </seg>
         <seg id="p244">Report of Nebraska State Board of Achiculture assumed a wave-like topography unsuited for further cultivation, and difficult to treat from the standpoint of erosion control except to plant them to grass, shrubs and trees. As a whole Nebraska farmers are carrying out fairly good rota - tion practices. The acreage of sweet clover and alfalfa in Nebraska at one time exceeded that of any other state. The drouth period has reduced this temporarily but it is expected to .soon be back to normal or above. Good rotations are of course the foundation of any ade - quate erosion control program on cultivated land. _^________M_____._. . -I . , ________ ni'ii^ S oilCa_Tater n'tinnS """ *'" "-"¦-«"»«* »™ practical mean* of co n3e "rvi nX Other erosion control practices such as contour farming, strip cropping, terracing, gully control, etc., are being used only to very im.ted extent The adoption of many of these practices requires technical knowledge or training to put them into successful operation. Such technical service has not been available to farmers generally. The Extension Service, with limited funds and personnel has been able to give this assistance in but a very limited way. The Soil Conservation Service Recognizing the need for technical service for erosion control, and _____ r agricu„ ural land of the ™«°n * rapidly becoming depleted Congress enacted legislation setting up the Soil Conservation Service to carry out demonstration work in erosion control and to pro - vide technical service to the farmers of the country. At one time here were three demonstration projects and 22 CCC camps doing tS! type ot work in Nebraska. At the present time the number 0 f camps has been reduced to twelve. These units have been operating ¦n Nebraska since 1933. Many thousands of demonstrations have </seg>
         <seg id="p245">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association been established showing how erosion may be controlled under widely varying conditions. Nebraska farmers have taken a real interest in these demonstrations and many more requests for assistance have been received than can be taken care of. .-..'.."_ Soil Conservation Districts Recognizing that although erosion control is in the main a problem of individual farm units, a comprehensive and effective program cannot be carried out without community interest and responsibility. The Soil Conservation Service is now proposing that in the future, funds allocated for erosion control activities shall be primarily through Soil Conservation Districts formed by the people who live on the land. Our last legislature enacted legislative bill 553 which enables com - munities to organize these districts. It is hoped that through them the work will progress more rapidly than in the past and that a greater consciousness of the need for erosion control measures will be created not only in the mind of the individual but in the collective minds of communities. Runoff and soil movement does not stop at farm. boundaries. Erosion control is, therefore, necessarily a. community problem. The Soil Conservation District facilitates community action. When land is permitted to deteriorate the burden of taxes and community betterment is thrown on the land that is conserved. An eroded farm is thus a liability to the community in which it lies. SOIL CONSERVATION DISTRICTS H. E. ENGSTROM, State Coordinator, Soil Conservation Service Three hundred years ago a vigorous people began the occupation of the richest agricultural continent of the earth, it was a veritable "promised land.". Now the period of occupation has come to an end: the frontiers of new land have disappeared. Actually the era of occu - pation ended economically nearly a generation before it was recognized politically.- A sharp turn in national policy for effective conservation was made in the passage, without a dissenting vote in either house of Congress, of the Soil Conservation Act of 1935, and in the passage, a year later of the Soil Conservation, and Domestic Allotment Act. By these two Acts congress establishes a policy to bring to an end the era of agri - cultural exploitation and to initiate an era of agricultural conservation. The first great impetus to the national philosophy of conservation was given by President Theodore Roosevelt's Congress of Governors in 1908, on the conservation of natural resources. Doubtless the conserve- </seg>
         <seg id="p246">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture tion Acts of 1935 and 1936 are linked to the concepts generated in the national consciousness at that time. If it has taken nearly 30 years and a major depression to provide the machinery to undertake the conser - vation of the soil—our basic resource, we may expect it to require some time to bring about agricultural conservation. But the fact of transcend - ant importance is that Congress has recognized that the wastage of soil and moisture resources on farm, grazing and forest lands, resulting from soil erosion is a menace to the national welfare, and that it is declared to be the policy of Congress to provide for the permanent con - trol and prevention of soil erosion. The task is tremendous, but the opportunity to undertake the task has been made. We must recognize that we are not yet out of the stage of exploitation. We may have to sacrifice many thousands or perhaps millions of good acres before soil conservation is achieved. We can foresee a time when we shall localize our cultivated crop production on those acres where permanent agri - culture can be assured. It is quite generally realized that society and the farmer have a mutual interest in the land, a rather new concept which assumes that society has an interest in the privately owned farm which is equal to the interest of the owner himself. It becomes the duty of the land owner to -so handle his land as to conserve the soil and its fertility in the interest of society and it becomes the duty of society to assist the land owner to make the best use of his land. Thus the individual land owner and society share the responsibility of preserving our lands for the genera - tions to come. The philosophy of democratic- government revolves around the principle that the mass of the people is capable of governing. A democ - racy, therefore, cannot be said to be succeeding unless the mass of the people participate in the affairs of government. Only their participation makes a democracy work. The Soil Conservation District Law The Nebraska soil conservation districts law enacted at the last session of the legislature places the responsibility for the initiative and :i management of a soil conservation program upon local folk. j' In considering this legislation it may be said in the first place that } there is nothing in the law which requires the formation of Soil Conser- . vation Districts.

You and I, who work with farm people, know that they don't want to see the land abused. The kind of people who live on the land like green fields, and like to harvest good crops. Such folk are willing to work together and with the assistance of society's agencies to assure that posterity will inherit green fields and forests rather than eroded hillsides and barren plains. . ....... -..-....' .'¦¦'¦•' ...

TRAGEDY OF LAND EXEMPLIFIED AT FARM SALE JOHN. WILTSE, Falls. City Recently a farm of 120 acres was offered for sale at the court house door. The highest bid for it was $7.50 an acre. The improvements on the land could not be replaced for less than several times the amount bid. Probably no time within the last two generations could this land have been bought for so little money. The present depression, while partly responsible, is not the sole cause of this land selling at so low a figure. The main cause is the fact that this land has been robbed from year to year without any effort to replace the fertility taken from the soil. It has been permitted to be cut by ditches. The top soil has been permitted to wash away. Timber has been cut and no effort made to replace it. There is nothing left except barren land or earth containing no food for plant life. This farm once maintained a family in comfort and produced enough more than they needed to supply at least one other family. Now, no man Can live on this farm and support a family as he should. Soil Erosion is Widespread ¦ But this is riot the only farm which has been permitted to be ruined by erosion, and by robbing the soil of its fertility. All over our country similar farms can be found. It is said that there are millions of acres in the United States, which at one time provided comfortable livings for their inhabitants, now abandoned. Poor land makes poor homes, poor people, and discontent. Rich and fertile land makes for good homes, I plenty, comfort, and a contented people. It is said that many of'the ! land croppers in the southland live a life more miserable than the poorest ! peasant of Europe. </seg>

SRB Talking about bindweed is not easy. Yesterday we heard about 'sorghums, over and over again. I noticed no one mentioned my subject, that of bindweed. They seem to stay away from it. I don't like to talk about it myself. I like something more pleasant. But, bindweed is with us, and it is with us to stay—unless we say that it shall go. It is up to us to make it go. Let us, for the moment, note the picture in our state. What is the bindweed situation in Nebraska, did you ever stop to think? In one 7 word I would say it is serious. In another way I would say it is bad, and to make it worse.we might say it is getting no better. I don't think anyone will disagree with me on that point. . I have traveled through a good portion of the state and I haven't seen a county yet where they don't have bindweed. I don't believe, I have been within a radius of 100 miles of Lincoln, and-found a single township that didn't have bindweed. Most farms still claim no bind - weed, although many put it this way—very honest about it—they say, "I don't have bindweed; at least, I don't think I have bindweed. I mean, I hope I don't have bindweed." There are many farms that have bind - weed only in small patches, but even that word, "small patches," doesn't mean much any more. A few years ago lit really meant a small patch, a few plants. Since that time these patches have increased in size and they, are still spoken of as small patches, by these men. They now may be an acre or more in extent -; j.- </seg>
         <seg id="p250">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I have heard a good many say this, "I don't have much bindweed, only scattered plants over my farm." That is indeed bad, it couldn't be worse. I feel this type of infestation makes a most serious situation. Bindweed will soon take the whole farm. We have a good many farms— too many—that have 10, 15, 20, 30, 50 acres of bindweed and there are numerous farms that have been completely taken by bindweed and I have seen farms that have been abandoned because of bindweed in - festation. Is that serious enough. It is rather a dark, discouraging pic - ture to view. Why Have We Failed to Control Bindweed? We might ask: "Have we failed? Are we failing in the control of bindweed?" Well, figures don't lie. Then, why have we failed? As I see it, there are several reasons. There have been and are some de - lusions about bindweed. Some people think it is just another weed. We have been excited about other weeds in the past, they say, and we have forgotten about them, and these same people think we will forget about bindweed. Again, there are those hopeful souls who think that some day we will find some use for bindweed and they want to have plenty so when that time comes they can cash in on it. Also, there are those who think it makes pretty good pasture. Bindweed did supply feed during the years of drouth. They said, "Bindweed was all we had." I will agree with that but I am afraid they won't be able to confine it to where they have it now, and when better times come they will want to. raise something better than bindweed even for pasture. I wonder if I couldn't recommend to the economists that it might be used satisfactorily in controlling overproduction. I think it will do that very nicely. I could also recommend it to the conservation people to hold the land, but somehow they don't seem to want bindweed for that purpose; they seem, to prefer something else. And then, there is the pessimist who says it' can't be done. He throws the towel into the ring and accepts defeat.! "It just can't be killed, that's all," he says—he has tried it, "it can't be done." We have cleared up some of these delusions. That is a hopeful' sign. I would say that there are still other reasons as to why we failed. Some say it is too costly to get rid of bindweed. I will agree it is costly but it will never be any less costly with more bindweed and we will have more bindweed the longer we delay. So I can't see any future in that direction. I do believe here is another reason why bindweed is on the increase. We have failed partly because of the lack of cooperation and lack of understanding between the land owner and tenant. I don't know how this can be corrected. That is one of our problems. I don't believe all the counties and the state have always set a good example in fighting bindweed. I don't believe bindweed is altogether a farmer's problem. It belongs to all of us. It is our problem—not altogether the farmer's problem. </seg>
         <seg id="p251">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association An Eradication Program is Necessary I might go on and talk along that line but I don't think it is neces - sary. A more important question is this: What shall we do? We can do a number of things. We are faced with alternatives. We can, if we wish, try to sell bindweed. If we can find a man who will buy an in - fested farm. That, however, won't solve the bindweed problem—wouldn't get rid of the weed. Even if we get a farm that is free, it may soon become infested. Second, we might permit it to spread and try to live with it the best we can. I don't believe you Will say that that is the thing to do. Third, we might try to keep it in its present place and not permit it to spread to areas not infested. This is impossible. I would say then there is only one other way, and that is the only sane, safe, and logical one: "Get rid of it." Can we get rid of it? Some say it can't be done. I have worked with bindweed just long enough to know that it can be done. I don't claim to know a great deal about the weed. I have worked with it, have seen others work with it. I not only think that we can get rid of bindweed but I know we can. It can be done. It has been done. There are various methods of eradicating bindweed. I would say, however, that they differ as to cost, they differ as to effectiveness. We should choose, therefore, the most suitable, most effective, least costly, method. I I shall run through some of the methods very briefly, and let you : judge for yourself as to their merits. A number of farmers have turned to common salt to kill the weed. We know common salt will kill bind - weed if you use enough of it. To kill established patches you have to use about 1 pound of salt to a square foot of ground and that means about 21 or more tons to the acre. Buying salt as low as $5 per ton, would mean over $100 per acre to kill bindweed, —then when you have killed it, you have a soil that is sterile —that can not produce. We can't look to salt to kill bindweed. ..' Chemical Treatment How about sodium chlorate? We know sodium chlorate will kill bindweed if we can get it next to the roots of the plant. This requires moisture. Water has been a scant article in Nebraska in recent years. Still we do have some moisture in the fall, so we recommend the appli - cation of sodium chlorate in the fall. In our county here, we think 3 pounds to a square rod does the job. There may be some followup but we should expect that to get rid of bindweed. Any time in September, October, and even in November, we have applied sodium chlorate in dry form and have had good success. I would say when you apply it, be sure that you go outside of the patch because the plants send under - ground parts in all directions and unless we can catch those with the sodium chlorate you will have,a ring of bindweed after you have killed </seg>
         <seg id="p252">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture your patch. This was told to a man over in York county not very long ago and this part was particularly stressed: "Be sure to go at least six feet outside of the patch all around." He replied, "Hell, I would have to go outside of York County!" I don't think that we can afford to go that far. Furthermore, I don't think that York county is the only county that has bindweed; others have plenty too. I don't know whether any of the counties aire trying to see which should rank first, but anyway, there are a lot of counties that have bindweed in an abundance greater than they should have. We find in applying sodium chlorate to the plant itself that only a little amount comes in contact with the plant and that the plant takes it in so slowly, that, as a rule, it isn't very effective. It is the sodium chlorate that you apply to the ground and that it carried by the moisture into the ground and in to contact with the roots that does the killing of bindweed. Clean Tillage What are some other ways of eradicating bindweed? I could have a gentleman stand up here and tell you a way all his own. Your efficient seed analyst has destroyed bindweed by simply pulling the plants. He secured eradication by doing the job every week, over a year and a half. It can be hoed out but that calls for much persistence and regularity. Of recent years I have heard of oil burners. They evidently kill bindweed. They destroy the top and if this is done regularly it would be about the same as cultivation. Cultivation is our hope and most farmers are turning in that direction. Many are getting rid of bindweed by culti - vating cleanly, at regular intervals. They keep at it until they get rid of it even if it takes more than two years to do it. We, as a rule, recommend the duckfoot cultivator because it cuts all the plant underground, and here we might pause long enough to ask: What are we really trying to do when we cultivate? We cut off the tops and make the roots build up new shoots, and before they are ready to put food back into the roots, we cut them off again. We keep doing this regularly until the roots become exhausted and die. So I would say that in cultivation be sure that your implement is cutting the plants, and that once you start, don't give up until you complete the job. Ac - cording to later findings we learn that we don't have to go into the fields as often as we once thought we had to. Experiments here at the College and at York and at the Colorado University say we can permit plants to grow for six days after emergence and secure eradication by -tillage. In other words, if we permit a growth of six days after bindweed comes through and figuring that it will take about four or five days to come through the ground, there would be about ten or 12-day interval between cultivations. That, it seems to me, isn't too often. If we can reduce the cost of cultivation per acre to a reasonable amount which should be in </seg>
         <seg id="p253">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association the neighborhood of about 35 or 40 cents for each Cultivation, depend - ing on the number of acres per hour and upon the equipment used, it should not cost more than $8 to .10 per acre to eradicate bindweed. In a few instances it may cost more, but more often I think it will be less. It takes somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty-five cultivations over two years to eradicate bindweed. You may have to carry over into the third year in some few cases where the plants are particularly well established, but suppose you spend $10 eradicating bindweed by the cultivation method. Compare this amount with the sodium cholorate cost. The chemical costs from 8% to 10 cents per pound—3 pounds, at the least, per square rod are necessary to destroy bindweed. That represents a cost of over $40 per acre. But, we don't always get rid of it with 3 pounds per square rod. In some counties they have to use more, con - sequently you can figure that your sodium chlorate will cost you $40 to $60 per acre to kill bindweed. You can afford it on small patches but you can't on large acreages. I don't want to take too much time on methods. You can get specific directions through the Experiment Station which would take too long for me to give at this time. ,:¦;-.'.¦ The Present Situation I will pass on to the next phase of my discussion. How far have we gotten? First we established the fact that we have too much bindweed. SecOnd, we agreed that we must get rid of it, but we haven't gotten rid of it. That is about where we stand. What can we do? What shall we do? Is there a cooperative way? Could we get together and work to - gether?. Could four farmers in a square mile agree that they will all start eradicating bindweed and buy a duckfoot cultivator together and work together? Couldn't that be done? But some one will say, we will take care of our bindweed on the land but how about the bindweed on the highway? The county commissioners are, as a rule, very anxious to get rid of the bindweed and wherever a farmer makes any attempt to eradicate his own, they usually furnish sodium chlorate and clear the highway. But they won't do that in all cases. We need something else. I think if we can work cooperatively we will handle the bindweed situation in a better manner. That brings me to the weed eradication law. '. ¦¦' '-'•'" .7' What about this new weed eradication law? I am here not to praise nor to criticize it., You would do the same if you were to stand here. You would probably state the law and let it stand on its merits. Can the law help us to get rid of bindweed? How? Let us see. The law passed by your last legislature is divided into two parts. One part deals with the eradication and control, and the other part of the law deals with prevention of bindweed. Those sections dealing with prevention have to do with transportation of infested grain or seed or infested feed, and the selling of infested grain and feed, cleaning of </seg>
         <seg id="p254">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture threshing machines, etc. I will not enter into a discussion of that phase of it. Legislation to Assist in Bindweed Control I shall touch briefly upon that portion of the law „hich has to do with the control and eradication. I might say here that the law hasn't been tested out, we don't know how good it is. I believe, however,, that it is the best possible. Had the legislature known anything better they would have incorporated that into the law, but at the time they did not know anything better. I don't think the legislature claims the law. is perfect. It may need modification. Time will tell. I-st us note some of its general provisions. The law says that there shall be an advisory committee. That is a wise provision. On the com - mittee are the Director of Agricultural Extension, Mr. Brokaw; the chairman of the Department of Agronomy of the College of Agriculture, Dr. Keim; president of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association, Mr. Thompson; and the chairman of the State Horticultural Society, Mr. Baker. These men are to advise and I know they certainly are in a po - sition to advise. Another wise provision is this: The law does not affect you or anyone else until you ask for it. The initiative is left to the people. In order to have the act come into operation, you must petition for it, and once you petition and organize under the act, then the people administer their own affairs. That seems fair. Still another provision in the law says that a village or a city district shall be organized in exactly the same way as a rural district which to me means this—that the bindweed problems belongs to the city dwellers as well as to the man on the farm. The outstanding feature, however, is the district or - ganization. You might ask—why organize a district? I will say just what the law says—once you organize a district then within that dis - trict, according to a certain plan, a district weed eradication program begins. Every infestation is taken care of. Suppose I am in your dis - trict or neighborhood and all of you men have been striving hard to get rid of bindweed and I do nothing, I let it go. You may have asked me to cooperate, but I won't cooperate. Under the new law you could include me in the district and make me cooperate. The second point that I would like to bring out is this. It says when a district is organized, all the highways through the district and adjacent to it, all railroad right-of-ways, all ditches and canals, shall be cleared of bindweed. Isn't this what we were asking for in the first place? There is a way, then, of clearing of highways, right-of-ways." Organization of Districts How to organize a district? It takes at least 51.. of the resident landowners of a given area to petition for organization. That is the first step. That petition must include legal description of all the land </seg>
         <seg id="p255">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association the land owners, and their places of residence. There must also appear on the petition a statement that the petitioners are willing to be taxed to pay the cost of eradication. When the petition is drawn up, it is filed with the county clerk of the county in which the proposed district is located. With that petition must be deposited $50.00. This money will be used to make a preliminary survey and to hold a hearing. If. the organization goes through then the $50.00 is returned to the depositors and the district assumes the cost of that survey and that hearing.. If it does not go through the sum is used to cover the cost. The county clerk need only to see that the petition is in proper form, and sends it to the director of the Department of Agriculture and Inspection at Lincoln. The law says that the director shall proceed to make a survey of those areas to see how much bindweed there-is. He makes a map and on this map he must indicate the location and the amount of infestation on each parcel. When he completes the map he calls the advisory committee and they go over the original petition, study the survey and make a recommendation granting the petition in part or in whole, or denying it, That is all they do—simply recommend. Then that petition and that recommendation are sent back to the county clerk. The clerk now calls a hearing before the county super - visors of the county in which this proposed district is located. Each land owner must be notified by registered mail and for three consecutive weeks there must appear a notice of this hearing in a legal newspaper of the county. There must be a statement showing why the hearing is held, all the land must be described, and the owners' names and places of residence given. At the hearing the county supervisors listen to argu - ments for and against organization. When the hearing is completed, the supervisors have three things before them—the original petition, the recommendation from the Department of Agriculture, and the re - sult of the hearing. On the basis of these they are to make a written order! as to the formation of a district or deny the petition. So it is the county supervisors who finally settle the question of district organization. If organization of the district is ordered, then the county clerk calls all the land owners, again, to elect their district supervisors—not less than three nor more than five are chosen. Any one of them can be recalled at any time by. a three-fourths vote of the land owners. As soon as the district supervisors are elected, they organize; they elect a chairman, secretary, treasurer; the treasurer becomes bonded for $5000. After the organization is completed, they take the written order of the county supervisors and file it with the county clerk and with the Secre - tary of State and the organization is complete. They have now a body corporate or a corporation. We could go on and say'that these district supervisors now have to estimate the cost of operating the district, and after they estimate the </seg>
         <seg id="p256">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture cost of operating the district, that they shall make assessments and they must hold a hearing on these assessments and finally, ratify them and levy taxes against the land. These taxes are paid to the district supervisors, and if they are not paid, then they are certified to the county clerk and the county treasurer collects the money and turns it over to the district supervisor. That, in brief, is what the law says. The latest development is this: In Scotts Bluff county, according to the newspapers, they want the dis - tinction of having the first bindweed district in the state. They have petitioned, and, instead of having 51 per cent, they had 90 per cent of the resident land owners. They have filed the petition with the county clerk and the county clerk forwarded it to the Department of Agri - culture. That is as far as it has gotten. They are making a survey at the present time. After the survey is made, then the Department of Agriculture and the advisory committee will make the recommendation which will be sent back to the county clerk and he will call the hearing before the county supervisors. I have taken your time; you have shown such fine spirit. You have listened although I may not have spoken well, but I know I have al - ready spoken long enough. In closing, permit me to say: the bindweed situation will not clear up until you and I determine fully that it must go. We can't live with it and therefore, we should destroy it. Work to destroy it should start at once. This state can not develop normally as an agricultural state if we permit bindweeds to increase, and it is up to you and me to determine whether or not bindweed will rule in Nebraska. ANNUAL MEETING CROP GROWERS' ASS'N. C. Y. THOMPSON, Pres., Presiding Thursday, Dec. 9, 1937 Mr. Thompson called on Mr. Gross to read the minutes of the last meeting. The minutes were approved and accepted as read. After some discussion regarding what new officers should be elected since this was the second meeting in 1937, it was moved by Mr. Wahlgren and seconded by Mr. Gross that "A" of section 4 of Article 4 of the constitution be changed to read as follows: "A. The president and the directors from districts two, four and six shall be elected at the annual meeting held in 1937 and at each odd numbered year thereafter. The secretary-treasurer and the directors from Congressional districts one, three, and five shall be elected at the annual meeting held in 1938 and at each even numbered year there - after." Motion carried. </seg>
         <seg id="p257">Nebraska Crop Growers' Association Mr. Thompson announced the membership would' elect the presi - dent, directors for the second, fourth, and sixth districts, and a secretary to fill out Mr. Stewart's unexpired term. Dr. Keim, Mr. McQuistan, and Mr. Heyne were appointed on the nominating com - mittee. The report of the auditing committee was read by Amos Gram - lich, chairman. The report covered the period of January 1, 1937 to December 1, 1937—11 months. : The other committee members were E. F. Frolik and Darrell Bauder. Mr. Gramlich moved the report be accepted. Motion seconded by Mr. Bert Mott. Carried. . The president called for any resolutions, and said, "I think the resolution we passed last year which Mr. Gross read in regard to the manufacture of chlorates is of sufficient importance to stress a little more. There is a possibility of having that resolution adopted in order to bring a little pressure to bear on some of our. Congressmen. I have taken the matter up with Mr. Stefan and he sent me a detailed report of the work done on the Muscle Shoals project. It seems that the biggest.cost in the manufacture and distribution of chlorates is in getting the raw material down there and distributing the chlorate after it is manufactured. In other words, it doesn't cost so much to manufacture. For that reason our resolution suggests that the salt be obtained in Kansas where there is plenty of it and that Nebraska's hydroelectric plants be used for power in the manu - facturing process. It seems quite feasible to do the thing we are suggesting. I think it might be in order to. have a motion of some kind to urge the board of directors to take a little further action. The only purpose of that is we might get a little publicity'on it, whereas if we leave that resolution from last year, nobody will know anything about it except the board, of directors." Mr.. Gross: "I move that the board of directors again present to our Congressmen the importance of this resolution." The motion carried. Mr. Thompson: "I want to say to the nominating committee that we have a lot of good men in this organization and I don't want to monopolize the job as president. It should be distributed and I would like to be relieved of the job." .'-.- ' .... ¦¦' '¦ .'-'¦¦ Dr. Keim: "The nominating committee would like to nominate Mr. C. L. Dietz to continue as director in district six, Herman Ebers in district four, and Mr. Amos Gramlich in district two. Following the wish of our president which we hesitate to do, but we are taking him at his word and we know he is busy, we have nominated Howard Wahlgren for president of the Crop Growers' Association, and Mr. D.

I move that since the secretary-treasurer is involved in this, that the president declare the nominees elected. That doesn't mean anyone couldn't present other names if he so wishes." The motion was seconded and carried. Mr. Thompson: "We have another matter here which I think should have some attention. It is in regard to reduced field inspection fees for vocational agriculture students who wish to grow certified seed. I believe Mr. Deems, of the Vocational Agriculture Department, is here and since he has brought this matter up, maybe he could make an explanation of what he would like to have us do." (My. Deems was not present.) Mr. Gross: "1 have discussed this matter with Mr. Deems and 1 move that we refer this to the board of directors for consideration." The motion was carried. Mr. Thompson introduced Mr. Howard Wahlgren, the new presi - dent, who responded with a few remarks and thanks. The meeting was adjourned. </seg>

THE NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL MEETING Held in the Dairy Building College of Agriculture University of Nebraska Lincoln, Nebraska. Thursday, December 9, 1937. PRESIDENT-...-.. ___________ A . Egger, Roca ..:-¦¦; SECRETARY.., .....................,...._. _. Crowe, Lincoln THURSDAY MORNING •¦--'.' Dairy Barn . . More than one one hundred dairymen assembled at the dairy barn for what. has become one of the most interesting and useful meetings held by the association. Mr. George Trimberger of the University of Nebraska was the first speaker with a very practical discussion of dairy management problems which he outlined as follows:— .;_:- I. Feeding Grain to Calves up to 1 year of age. .A good grain mixture for calves up tol year of age could consist ./¦ of:'. '"'•."••': 35 lbs. ground corn j 6 lbs. fish meal 2d lbs. wheat bran 2 _ bs . steam bone meal --lbs. ground oate lib. salt 8 lbs. linseed meal lib. lime (finely ground) ._ .Put grain before the calf when it is one week old and feed all the gram it will eat until the calf is 3 months of age, then limit the gram to 4 or 5 pounds daily depending upon the condition of the calf Feed this nmount until the calf is one year of age and then change to a protein heifer mix which will be given later. ..... :r ..::'¦' 11. Feeding Cod Liver Oil to Calves. The feeding of cod liver oil to calves is becoming a more common practice because the beneficial effects of it in building a good straight strong bone, and the prevention of disease by raising the resistance' is evident. A number of calves have been observed with rickets in Nebraska and cod liver oil prevents this disease. </seg>
         <seg id="p280">Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture Any dairyman wishing to feed cod liver oil to some of his best calves could do so by the use of the following rules: 1. Start feeding at ten days of age or after the calf drinks out of a bucket. 2. Feed in milk once daily 18 c.c. up to 2 months of age. The 18 c.c. can be measured by using an ordinary glass dipper such as is used for measuring acid in the Babcock milk test. •'!. Then from the age of 2 to 4 months of age, feed 2 dippers, or 3(i c.c, of cod liver oil in the milk once daily. 4. Another month of 18 cc. daily and the feeding of cod liver oil is discontinued at the age of 5 months. 111. A New System or "Dry Calf Starter System" of Feeding Calves. This system involves less expense and labor and allows the dairyman to sell his milk instead of feeding; it to the calves. The meal or "Dry Calf Starter" has the following formula of everyday ingredients and can be mixed at home. •'iO lbs. ground yellow corn 5 lbs. fish meal 2fi lbs. ground oats 1 lb. salt 20 lbs. dried skim milk '_ lb. steam bone meal 10 lbs. wheat bran '&#132; lb. ground limestone 5 lbs. linseed meal 2 lbs. cod liver oil (U. S. P. Standard) Mix the cod liver oil thoroughly with the bran before it is added to the ration and then mix the ration thoroughly. (Other vitamin A and D concentrates could be used to furnish an equivalent amount of vitamins instead of cod liver oil if they are cheaper.) Feed Ayrshire and Holstein calves whole milk twice daily for 8 weeks at the rate of 9 pounds daily the first 4 weeks. Then feed 7, 6, 4 and 4 pounds daily in the succeeding weeks. Feed Jersey and Guernsey calves whole milk twice daily for 10 j weeks at the rate of 7 pounds daily the first 4 weeks. Then feed 6,5, &gt; 5, 4, 3 and 2 pounds daily in the succeeding weeks. ( With the above amounts of milk, provide all the "Dry Calf Starter" j grain mix given above that they will eat until they eat 4% pounds daily for Holsteins and Ayrshires, and 3% pounds daily for Jerseys and Guernseys. Feed this amount until the calves are six months old. Then give them the same grain mix as the calves raised the common way receive. Such a grain mix is given under I. Water must be provided at all times because the above mix is fed dry and the water is the only liquid that the calves get. </seg>
         <seg id="p281">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association , IV. Feeding the Yearling Heifers. Many feeders neglect the yearling heifers too much by not pro - viding enough protein feed which is vital to growth. The feeding of hay once, daily, all that the animals will eat up clean in five hours, is a good practice. Silage also is fed [once daily, the quantity varying from 15-20 pounds, depending on the size and condition of the animal. The grain mixture should contain plenty of protein and the following is a good one which can be fed at the rate of 2 pounds per head daily. 100 lbs. ground corn 100 lbs. cottonseed meal 100 lbs. wheat bran '¦'.'! 1W lbs. linseed meal This is a new mix and produces excellent results for growing heifers. It tends to produce growth rather than fat. V. A Knowledge of the Practical Treatments of Diseases is Important to Maintain a Herd of Dairy Cows. J 1. Breeding Trouble. Eliminate Bang's disease by blood testing and removal of re - actors. Be sure that cows, heifers and bulls are receiving adequate quantities of .protein and phosphorus and lime. ' ', Trichomonad infection of cows and bulls is sometimes the cause of many services without conception. If this is the trouble, the holding off from breeding for several months of the infected cows is advisable, as is the using of a young bull exclusively on the virgin heifers. This infection is apparently trans, itted from cow to cow by the bull. 2. Lice Treatment. i • Finely! powdered Sabadilla seed, put in a shaker and sprinkled .along the entire back of the animal and along the neck to the head is quite effective in killing lice if done three times at ten day intervals. 3. Ring Worm Treatment- Sandpaper: down the surface of the affected areas and then paint with a solution consisting of lodine 40 parts, Phenol 40 parts, and Glycerine 20 parts. Apply once daily with a swab on a stick for 4 days and then apply 4 more times every other day. If the above mixture is so strong.that it blisters or produces swelling, then add a small amount of alcohol or water to it. 4. Constipation. One pound of Epsom salts in water as a drench for mature animals and _. of. a pound for young animals, Young calves under six months should be given 2 tablespoons of castor oil. </seg>
         <seg id="p282">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 5. Calf Scours. Isolate the calf and decrease the amount of milk for a few days. Give 2 tablespoons of castor oil once when scours are first noticed. Then give in the milk 2 teaspoons at every feeding, a powder consisting of 2 parts Bismuth and 1 part Solol until the calf has re - covered. G. Calf Pneumonia. Prevention of this is most important. Calves should be kept out of drafts especially such as a draft caused by having doors open on opposite sides of the pen. Cod liver oil builds up a resistance to disease and helps prevent it 7. Removing Warts. Put castor oil on the surface so it is completely covered and the air shut out. This is done twice daily for several weeks. Missing a single day will lengthen the time it takes to remove the wart. 8. Foot Rot Treatment. Wash out the infected foot; cut into the affected part until Wood appears, then apply creosol disinfectant undiluted. A daily treatment of two or three successive days is usually sufficient if the animal is kept out of the muddy yard on a dry straw bed. The association was very fortunate in obtaining Dr W E Petersen from the Dairy Division of the University of Minnesota." Dr" Petersen is one of the outstanding men in his field and gave freely of his knowledge of the subject "How Milk is Made" as is evidenced in his talk which appears below. HOW MILK IS MADE by W. E.

         <seg id="p283">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Milk is fluid consisting of water into which is dispersed or dis - solved fat, proteins, sugar, mineral salts and other minor constituents such as vitamins. The fat is dispersed in tiny fat globules. One cubic centimeter of milk contains from 2 to 4 billion of these tiny fat particles. Not only is the fat of milk dispersed differently than it is in body tissues but it differs from body fat in its chemical makeup. While body fats contain mainly two kinds of fat acids, milk fat con - tains an additional eight or more of these fatty acids. There are three proteins of milk—casein, albumin and globulin. Of these,. casein is found nowhere else but in milk. The albumin which resembles the albumin of blood in a general way is different in details. The globulin of milk is like the globulin of the blood and may be identical to it. \ The milk sugar, known as lactose, is found nowhere else in the body or in nature than in milk. It represents about 5 per cent of the milk. The salts of milk are very complex and differ in propor - tions from those of the blood. There are approximately six times as much potassium and only one-sixth as much sodium in milk as there are in blood. It is therefore evident that the udder synthesizes or makes nearly all the constituents of the milk and that but relatively little of the blood constituents find their way unaltered into milk. Some of the marvelous transformations of blood constituents into milk constituents will be considered under how milk is made. Not only is the manner in which the various milk constituents are made from blood constituents a matter of wonderment, but the rate of activity is astounding. There' are many cows that have produced over 100 pounds of milk in a day. In so doing, the udder synthesizes over 12 pounds of dry matter. This is equal to the dry matter represented [by a gain of about 25 pounds in a growing animal. A knowledge, of how each of these individual ingredients of milk is synthesized would be worth while to satisfy natural curiosity. In addition, solution of the problem as.to how milk is made may help in the solution of many of the problems concerned in the handling and processing of many of the milk; products, in treatment of the many afflictions the udder of cows are subject to, in dairy cattle breeding and other problems. If it were known just how all of the ingredients of milk were made, undoubtedly we would have information that would assist in the dairy processes where individual constituents of milk are broken down such as in cheese making, souring of milk and cream and also in the use of casein for its many applications. It is also reasonable to expect that if the processes of milk secretion were known, some </seg>
         <seg id="p284">Report of Nebraska State Boaro of Agriculture better method of treatment of mastitis would be suggested. The greatest probably practical value of a complete knowledge of how milk is made would be in its application to dairy cattle breeding. If all of the factors contributing to the making of milk were thoroughly understood and tests devised to ascertain whether any animal possessed or lacked in any or all of these essentials, it is easy to see how such would help in breeding dairy cattle Some little progress has been made in this direction as will be shown later. This brief consideration of milk and the desirability of knowing how milk is made must suffice and we are now ready to consider how milk is made. In such a consideration three questions naturally arise. These are where milk is made, when it is made, and how it is made. That milk is made in the udder is so evident and so generally known that it needs no comment here except to say that in the past it has been held by some that the udder acted only as a filter taking out of the blood the constituents of milk. That very few of the constituents of milk are found in blood made such a theory untenable. A brief consideration of the fundamental structure of the secretory tissue of the udder is advisable at this point. The cow's udder is divided into two halves that are quite well separated by a tough ligament. Each half has its own supply of blood and nervous con - nections but is divided into two parts known as quarters. Each quar- Huurc i. A sketch of a longitudinal section through one side of the udder of a cow, showinu the duet system. The ducts of the fore quarter irurhtl are independent of the ducts of the rear quarter. </seg>
         <seg id="p285">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association ter is separate from the other in so far as the ducts are concerned. Figure 1 shows a cross section of the udder of a cow through the teats of the fore and rear quarters.. It will be noted that there is a chamber above each teat which is known as the milk cistern. From this cistern from 20 to 60 ducts pass up into the udder. As each duct progresses upward it divides and re - divides hundreds of times until finally each duct is so small that it can be seen only by the aid of a microscope. At the end of each of the smallest ducts is an enlargement known as an alveolus. These enlargements with their tiny ducts leading into a larger duct resemble, when highly magnified, a bunch of grapes. This is illustrated in Figure 2 where the last branching of a duct is subjected to magnification. Figure Enlargement of the end of the milk H.. ¦ ducts showing the grape-like structure. Milk __F__r^^ *s synthesized in the "Grape" or alveolus and drained away through the tiny stem-like _t_l _r - If one of the grape like alveoli is cut and examined under a high power microscope it will look like the illustration in Figure 3. Here a ..': layer of cells will be seen on the outer edge of the alveolus. These cells are connected with the blood system on the outside from where the precursors of the milk are taken. In these cells the milk is synthesized and secreted into the opening of the alveolus from where it is drained by the ducts into the milk cistern. The causes of the development of the udder and milk secretions are just beginning to be understood. Much still remains to be done before; the process is fully understood but sufficient is known to give us a fair idea of this complex phenomenon. It is well known that as a heifer; grows older the udder enlarges. During pregnancy there is a </seg>
         <seg id="p286">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agricui/tuke 9 Figure 3. An enlarged cross sec- ' i tion of a grape of alveolus ; i showing the lining with cells ' - that produce milk. A normal udder contains billions of these j alvenn. [ ; rapid growth and following calving milk secretion sets in Each ' development is due to the secretion of certain hormones that brin„ !' ' about the change. ¦ { During growth of the heifer the udder develops, due to a hormone ! - secreted by the follicle of the ripening egg. This development then "' '. begins with the onset of sexual maturity. The growth of the gland due \ to this cause is only an extension of the milk ducts which at birth ' "? are very rudimentary consisting of a little branched duct above each _ teat. With each recurring heat period there is additional hormone i secreted and the duct system is further extended. Following preg- ' 1i nancy there is a rapid growth of the duct system due to increased |! secretion of the hormone. i § j When the growth of the ducts is completed a hormone from the '¦ ii corpus enterim causes the development of the alveoli where milk is secreted. Milk secretion, however, does not take place until a third I hormone secreted by the pituitary gland acts upon the gland cells. If V is possible to have an udder completely developed and no milk secretion take place because of the lack of this hormone from the - ? pituitary gland known as the lactogenic hormone. " ! !' Proof of the action of these hormones have been demonstrated in . ¦ small animals and goats. By the injection of the hormones in the -7 proper order the mammary glands have been developed and milk ' ' * </seg>
         <seg id="p287">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association secretion initiated in virgin and castiate females as well as in males. In the case of lactating cows and goats it has been found that individ - uals respond by increasing milk now following the administration of the lactogenic hormone. This fact indicates the probable value of this line of research to dairy cattle breeding. Individuals that respond to the administration of this hormone have inheritances for higher milk production for all factors concerned except for the hormone secretion. In breeding such animals it is apparent that special em - phasis should be laid upon securing bulls that are rich in their inheri - tance for this character. When is milk secreted? For a long time (and by some yet) it was believed that milk was secreted in two phases. Some milk was secrete . in the interim between milking.according to this belief, but the most was secreted at the time of milking. One of the chief reasons for this belief was the observation that after drawing the milk out of the udder there did not appear enough shrinkage to account for the milk withdrawn. Recent experiments have shown that all the milk that is drawn -;'"-. at a milking is present in the udder at the beginning of the milking. To prove, this, cows were slaughtered at the normal milking time I. and the! udders removed immediately after slaughter to be suspended I and milked. In most cases as much milk was withdrawn from the amputated udder as would have been drawn from the living cow. The milk was normal in its composition except for its fat content which ! was low. These' results led to the obvious conclusion that all the milk! drawn at a milking is present in the udder at the time of ¦ milking and that.in all probability milk secretion is a continuous 7 matter. - -.¦'•-•' In connection with the time of milk secretion, it was thought ¦ - '.' that the pressure developed by the accumulating milk might slow up the rate of secretion. A study was then inaugurated to ascertain . what pressures would develop in the udder due to the accumulation of milk and what the effects were of increased pressure upon the rate '£_-. of milk secreted. It is obvious that the effects of frequency of mak - ings are'involved in such a study. '} ' '"'¦'..'-¦"¦',•'• '¦..-.:-'" ¦ .- ' ¦ ¦¦'. i In this study cows were not milked for several days and the pres - »].-' sure of the milk in the gland was determined by a manometer. In these trials a number of difficulties were encountered as we could not evaluate the effect of the hydrostatic pressure of the milk in the I udder' nor could the effect of the pressure of the legs iipon the udder 1 be ascertained. To overcome this difficulty, air pressure in the udder . was resorted to. A tank was equipped so we could maintain any 1 desired pressure and this was applied to the inside of the udder of the k'- cow immediately after milking through teat tubes. When the air I: 7 .;-:.:! :•;._-. '.'7.. . - ¦ .. . -¦ ...'.!•¦ . V" ¦'..-.¦- ¦¦'¦ " | ¦-¦ "-7;' -7 7 .. 77 . 6 - • . ¦ ¦¦.'¦¦:•¦¦ ¦..-¦-..-¦¦. ¦ ¦ ¦-¦¦. : - ¦¦ . </seg>
         <seg id="p288">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture pressure was equal to about 40 millimeters of mercury (blood pressure is equal to about 110 millimeters of mercury) no milk was secreted. As the pressure is lowered, milk secretion begins and increases in rate with continued lowering of the pressure. The effect of pressure within the gland upon milk secretion finds practical application in explaining a decreased rate of milk flow by lengthening the period between milkings due to the development of pressure due to accumulation of milk. The effectiveness of air inflation of the udder in the cure of milk fever is also explained by an under - standing of the effect of pressure upon milk secretion. By inflating the udder with air the milk secretion is stopped and withdrawal of calcium from the blood ceases. This in turn permits replenishment of the blood calcium and recovery from the disease results. The discovery that milk secretion ceases when a certain pressure develops within the gland led to a study as to what happens to the milk within the gland when the maximum pressure is developed. By not milking cows for varying lengths of time and analyzing the milk when withdrawn a picture was secured of what happens to the milk left in the udder. In general the milk is resorbed but not until after there is a marked change in the character and composition - of the milk. The longer the milk is left in the udder the greater the change. In genera! the change is in the direction of the characteristics of mastitis milk. The milk sugar is lowered, salt content is increased, it becomes positive to brom thymol blue reaction, the cell count increases and it becomes thick and viscous. If the milk is not withdrawn it is finally completely resorbed and the cow is dried off. After extensive trials it has been found that the best way to dry off cows for the neccesary rest period is just to stop milking at the desired time. By so doing a maximum pressure is soon developed within the udder and resorption begins. Experiments have shown that there are no harmful effects upon the udder or the milk produced in the next lactation from this method of drying off cows. An occasional cow seems to be sensitized to her milk and cannot be dried off by this method without shock. . A series of other studies were made to study the effect of osmotic '% pressure or the pressure produced by substances in solution, upon milk secretion. Immediately after milking a like volume of the solu- • I tion studied was injected into the udder thru milk tubes and left until '¦¦! the next regular milking. Pure water and various concentrations of '' different salts and sugars were used. Here the behavior was exactly the opposite to that predicted upon the basis of known physical laws. When distilled water is injected it would be expected that water would ko into the blood and salts from the blood go into the secretion with a •¦ greatly lowered secretion. Instead of this on the next milking a normal amount of normal milk was secured. j i ! ; I i </seg>
         <seg id="p289">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association When solutions of salts or sugars were injected the amount of milk secreted decreased with the concentration of the sugar or salt. In the case of salt a 1.25 per cent of salt stopped milk secretion en - tirely.' When milk flow was stopped by this method recovery to normal milk flow required from one week to ten days. The complexity of the making of milk is best appreciated by con - sidering the constituents of blood used by the mammary gland. While much remains to be learned in this field sufficient is known to give an idea of the complexity of the process. The problem has been . attacked by analyzing arterial blood. before entering the udder and | venous blood after leaving the udder, by perfusing the gland after removal from the animal and by increasing the blood content of various constituents. By use of these methods some knowledge has been gained as to how. milk fat, milk sugar and milk proteins are made. As all of the constituents of milk must come from the blood it is of interest to realize that large quantities of blood must pass through the udder for the making of milk as only very small amounts of the different constituents are removed. On. the basis of the constituents taken out and measuring the blood flow by different means it is esti - mated that from 200 to 400 volumes of blood is needed to produce one volume of milk. A cow producing 50 pounds of milk would require from 10,000 to 20,000 pounds of blood to be circulated through the udder. One can easily realize that pumping that amount of blood is a | task of some magnitude and that the high producing cow really works.j '¦" !..-'! ' I---.'' To make milk fat the udder takes some of the blood fat out of the blood as it passes through. Analysis of the arterial blood and the venous blood coming out of the udder has shown that the mammary gland removes enough fat from the blood to account for the fat of the milk. The udder, however, does more than merely remove fat from the blood and deposit the same in the milk. In the gland some agent .' as yet hot understood, changes the blood fat into butterfat. Just | . how this is effected is not known but it is well established that butter - | fat differs greatly from blood fat or body fat. There is some evidence that the fat is stored in the udder for some time and the transforma - tion from body. fat to butterfat takes place slowly. Analysis of •i udders that were milked dry revealed.that they were unusually high in fat content and that the fat was about half way between butterfat . ".. and body fat. The amount of fat in the udder of a cow in milk may be as high as one-half Of the entire dry matter content. For dry cows the udders have much smaller amounts of fat and the fat is : similar to that of other glands of the body instead of being inter - mediate between butterfat and body fat as is the case with the lactating udder. </seg>
         <seg id="p290">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The significance of the changes that take place to the fat in the udder to form butterfat is not fully understood. Inasmuch as these changes are similar in nearly all species producing milk it seems logical to assume that fat must undergo these changes in order to be best suited for the young. Further studies of the comparative values of butterfat and body fat for the young viewed from this point may bring new revelations for the superiority of milk fat. Milk sugar or lactose has until recently baffled workers endeavor - ing to find out how it is made in the udder. It has been known that the sugar of the blood decreases as the blood passes through the udder and that by lowering the blood sugar through the use of insulin he amount of lactose in the milk could be lowered. However, attempts to increase the milk sugar through increasing the blood sugar by in - jection have failed. Attempts to synthesize milk sugar from blood sugar by the aid of mammary gland tissue or tissue extracts have also failed. Thi.s past year workers of both the Missouri and the Minnesota Stations discovered that as blood passed through the udder there was a decrease in lactic acid. The mammary gland, therefore, was taking lactic acid out of the blood which seemed logical might be used in the making of milk sugar. •.¦¦•'.• Proof for this has just been established by making milk sugar in the laboratory from blood sugar and lactic acid by the use of mam - mary gland tissue or an extract of such tissue. A mixture of lactic and salts, blood sugar and ground up gland tissue when incubated at blood temperature produced milk sugar. Thus one more of the many mysteries of how milk is made has been partly cleared. What practical value this may possess time only can tell. Knowledge as to how the proteins of milk are made is in a less satisfactory state than the previously discussed constituents. About the only statement that can be made with certainty at this time is that the proteins of the milk originate from the blood. What fraction, of the blood are the precursors of the milk proteins cannot be stated with certainty at this time except that in all probability the globulin " of the milk comes from the globulin of the blood and the two are I probably identical. j Both casein and albumin of the milk are different from the pro - teins of the blood. Whether these two proteins are built up from simpler compounds of the blood or are the results of alterations of blood albumin or blood globulin can only be conjectured at this time. Studies in progress at the present time may yield information that will solve this problem, The minerals of milk might at first glance seem to be the re - sult of simple filtering in from the blood. Close inspection, however, : . </seg>
         <seg id="p291">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association reveals that the mammary gland here, too, performs a careful selection as to what is taken out of the blood and synthesizes some new com - pounds.: The ratio of the different minerals of milk is greatly dif - ferent from the ratios of those mineral constituents in the blood. The calcium and phosphorus content of milk is 20 to ; 30 times that of the blood while the sodium chloride content of milk is but a mere fraction of that of the blood. In blood there is about 7 times as much sodium as potassium. "In milk this is reversed with about 7 times as much potassium as sodium. Other mineral ratios are likewise changed but these will show that the mammary gland exercises great selective powers with regard to the minerals it removes from the blood. While much more detail could be given relative to what is known about how milk is made, this must suffice for the time available. It is hoped that enough facts have been presented to give a better idea of what a complicated function is performed by the mammary gland. Some of the knowledge gained from a study of how milk is made has already helped in solving practical problems. It is hoped that further knowledge of the subject will further help in the solution of many problems in connection with breeding and management of dairy cattle. As the knowledge is extended in this field one gains a greater appreciation of the complex job the cow is doing in converting feedstuffs into milk. p 7 THURSDAY AFTERNOON Dairy Auditorium MR.

         <seg id="p294">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ally good talk this morning by Dr. W. E. Petersen and also a fine talk by Mr. George W. Trimberger of our own department. This afternoon we are pleased to hear another man. The man who is to talk to us next was formerly of Nebraska with the Extension Service. I asked him how long ago that had been as I find it was before my time. He was one time publisher of the Breeder's Gazette and in the past has been Secretary of the National Ayrshire Association. At the present time he is secretary of the National Dairy Associa - tion and manager of the National Dairy Show. At this time I am pleased to present Mr. Lloyd Burlingham of the National Dairy Asso - ciation. MR. BURLINGHAM: Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Asso - ciation. I greet you as representatives of an organization which for three years more than half a century has kept at the vanguard in the development of the dairy industry in this state. From a time when there was no dairying in Nebraska you have brought this important branch of agriculture to a point where it has national recognition in what is in truth not only the newest but the largest industry in America. Dairying nationally develops about three and one half billion dollars of new wealth in this country each year, a total surpassing that in any other industry. Moreover dairying when all its varied activities are compassed employs more American citizens than any other single business in the country. This industry has come forward in a relatively short time. Many of you know that small company of pioneers who set this industry going well under three quarters of a century ago. Important among the men I have known who helped greatly in Nebraska in building a sound business based on the production of the dairy cow were Pro - fessor Haecker, 0. Hull, H. H. Wing, Carl Gray, and W. H. Ferguson. Among those men who have been extremely active during the later period of this development are such present leaders as Otto Liebers and "Jake" Frost, here today. You have a sort of "in-law" hold on a most remarkable situation today in the fact that the father of your own Professor Haecker is the sole survivor of the original pioneers who laid out the bases and policies on which dairying has been developed in America. T. L. Haecker now living in Minnesota and 93 years old, I believe, has the extraordinary experience of having had an active part from the very beginning of dairying as an in - dustry. Now we have come to a time when there is no need in this state or in truth in most of the territory of the country for promotion of this industry. The need now is to improve that which we have. It </seg>
         <seg id="p295">(Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. is much more to the credit of the industry, much more satisfactory to the owner himself, that a good small herd be developed on a farm rather than lone of larger numbers which may not be so high in average productiveness. That is, the need now is for better dairying rather than for more dairy cows. This is essentially a very conservative sort of business. It is a way of living as much as it is an actual business. It is a permanent undertaking—one which, if it is not phenomenal in its return, is safe and affords a sense of security offered in but few other undertakings. Dairying is, all things considered, as fine an occupation as any citizen may have. That is true not only with respect to returns which a man entering this industry may expect to receive from intelligent application but it is true from the standpoint of the community in which he lives and from the interest of the country at large.- Fun - damentally it is altogether possible that the greatest problem faced in this country now is that of conserving natural resources. First of all is, of course, soil fertility. These hills which I have seen this morning between Omaha and Lincoln are less fertile now than when I worked here twenty-three years ago. Nebraska since its settle - ment and initial development has suffered tremendously in losses from the productive value of its land. A : man buying a farm here now, all things considered, finds it much less productive than when the fathers of the present farmers picked this land. Unless the general plan of farming in the state is radically changed from the present the sons of these present farmers will have land turned over to them with every evidence of still further depletion of real value. It is a fact in which no pride may be taken that Nebraska along with her sister states has made a record of fearful waste of the resources which the Creator placed at the disposal of the pioneers who first settled here. Dairying fits into any comprehensive plan for the conservation of soil resources and in these days when the governments, federal and by state, are so concerned with, this matter the dairy farmer not only has an opportunity but an obligation to fit his plans into a general •scheme which will go far toward saving and in some cases replacing the fertility resources of our acres. . The time has come when such an organization as yours may well consider whether its greatest good in the service of its own industry and in the betterment of the state may not be to set up an active pro - gram for taking special recognition of those men in the state who farm well, these men who are conserving the soil, who are so handling it that their acres will be turned over to their successors in a higher state of productivity than when they received them. There is a strikingly different relationship to the community at large of the man who continues to rob the soil for his own selfish benefit and the </seg>
         <seg id="p296">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture man who farms well and holds this soil for future generations. It seems to me high time that these patriotic conservors be raised up above their fellows and pointed out as men who are worthy of honor and extra recognition. Perhaps some day we will learn to put taxes where taxes belong - to levy heavily on those farmers who use the soil badly and to exempt to a great degree from all taxation those men who use the soil well. 1 look forward to a time when in Nebraska these better farmers will be honored and as we drive through the state we will find here and there on the gate posts of these men who till the soil and conserve it well tablets symbolic of their recognition. These tablets should be placed there at a time of a community gathering and the tablets should have inscribed on them words to the effect that "Here lives a man, a patriot of Nebraska, who leaves these acres more productive and more valuable to the state than when he received them." To do this dairy job well requires organization—to spread the good which these leaders do requires that communities be brought to - gether and (hat projects be carried forward in groups and in com - munities. Years ago it was boasted on dairy farms that this is an independ - ent way to live, that the dairy farmer was free from necessity of joining in with others, that he could live on a policy of "go-it-alone." Never was anything less true and in no industry in this country is it more certain that the only independence we may have is through placing dependence on those about us. This very organization, the Nebraska Dairymen's Association, in - dicates that in this state for well more than half a century it has been recognized that we can do things together to better advantage than they can be accomplished when we work singly. This industry was born through organization. Perhaps the most dramatic incident in proof of this came following the greatly demoralized situation in the cheese industry in the early days. So bad was the market set-up that the Wisconsin Dairymen's Association was or - ganized in 1871 to seek a remedy. Small cheese factories all over the state were without outlets for their products. Governor W. D. Hoard dramatized the necessity when he got this group of cheese producers together and, repiesenting them, walked into the office of the President of a great railroad in Chicago and secured attention and consideration with the striking statement: "I stand here repre - senting one million pounds of cheese seeking a way to market." Through this little organization a market was secured and from that time to this day dairymen in all branches of the industry </seg>
         <seg id="p297">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association have found basic necessity for working together in accomplishing their best imposes..- ' ¦'..¦... Tie leadership in the development of fine herds of cattle in Nebraska lies in the hands of the members of the various pure-bred record societies of the country. Without such organizations the integrity of pedigrees could not be maintained. The necessity for organization in this direction is obvious and the results which have been secured through mutual assistance in protecting the honesty of registry papers has giyen this country a most remarkable record of advancement in the development of pure-bred dairy cattle. Behind these .national associations, are state organizations for the several breeds and even in local communities it is found wise to organize in order that the interests of a particular group whose destiny is asso - ciated with -an individual breed may be advanced to advantage. '".- i ' ¦'¦' 7'¦ ':': !- '•'• ¦ ¦ '¦¦"'; " '¦¦ ¦ The basic production organization is the old time cqw testing association basically sound and a proved and true friend of the man who desires to improve his cattle through continuous testing. But it is necessary even here to have an organization and those men here in Nebraska whp twenty-five years ago were willing to join in with their fellows; and employ for year-round service trained men capable of keeping! records accurately did more for sound and profitable dairy cattle Business than they knew. Right along with this type of organization and in the long run just about as necessary is the co-operative bull association. Thus far we have given this type of organization relatively little attention. The time is on us now when to own as good sires as is necessary and to prove these animals out in order to retain the good ones these co-operative bull associations.must be put in use. .In no other way can we search out those occasional invaluable individuals capable of contributing great productive qualities to the breed. Cow test asso - ciations records kept year after year to prove the value of the bulls used in.the community and these: good proved bulls exchanged from group to group set a basis for real improvement. Last month I saw 'Grant Good of lowa at the Canadian Royal Winter Fair judging Belgian horses. To the group of onlookers he was a successful breeder of horses from the States. To me he was one of the most fortunate characters in the whole livestock world because of his finding that marvelous Belgian horse Farceur and having the courage to pay ? .3,000 for him—because Mr. Good knew that here was individuality and prepontency capable of favor - ably affecting a whole breed of horses. Old Katy Gerben here in Nebraska was an outstanding instance of virility and prepotency. There may be other Katy Gerbens here in our herds now if they can be found. There may be animals capable of exerting influence </seg>
         <seg id="p298">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture on our herds and on ouij breeds similar to the remarkable , record made by the great horse, Farceur. The question is can we find them. The answer is only through organization. The cow testing association, the herd test,| the co-operative bull associations are the most practicable means Vet placed at our disposal for maintaining profitable herds and for seeking out breeding stock which can carry these herds forward. In my belief the organization of greatest promise in the state of Nebraska—-the one of greatest promise as we look forward even a single decade is the 4-H Club group. Your Professor L. I. Frisbie, head of this work in Nebraska, has not only done a marvelous piece of work for the state but he is in a position to influence its future more than is any other man I know. He has organized in these groups 23,000 of the finest boys and girls in the length and breadth of this commonwealth. I saw them make a proud record in Chicago at the recent International Livestock Exposition. There are about 1,500 chosen boys and girls represented 1,200,000 members nationally. From this group ten health champions were selected and two of these were from Nebraska. Nebraska furnished the champion in wash dress classes, the first prize canning judging team, the first prize cotton school dress exhibit, the first prize five jars of fruit, and second prize clothes team, the third prize home furnishing team and the third place poultry judging team. At our National Dairy Show in Columbus, Ohio, in October Nebraska was forward in competition with cham - pion teams of twenty-five other states. Among Nebraska winnings was the first prize team in the judging of cattle and on that team was the top man of the entire contest. The Nebraska Dairymen's Association can do no better service for the state and can do nothing else to more surely guarantee its continued usefulness than to work in closest possible harmony with Mr. Frisbie and his group of leaders in the guidance and development of these 23,000 youngsters. More calf clubs, more young breeders clubs, more close tie-ups between this industry and these bright - eyed, forward-going youngsters means a sounder, safer dairy in - dustry in Nebraska in the future. All of these organizations of which I speak are useful—no one of them offers greater possibilities than 4-H Clubs. I commend to you with all possible earnestness your continued support and promotion of organizations in this state beginning with the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. Maintain clean pedigrees in these herds and back up the record societies nationally, hold on to local breeders associations, use even more widely the cow testing association and develop in each community a co-operative bull associa - tion. And last of all and perhaps most important of all tie yourself </seg>

Enough has been said of the boys and what they have done this year and we appreciate the help of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association in making this work possible. While the boys are setting up their equipment I would like to add that their demonstration is being given as an anti-climax to the season. It has been some time since the State Fair and they may have lost some of the enthusiasm that they had at that time I believe you will agree that their demonstration is a practical one, "The Building and Use of a Trench Silo." MR. MORTON: I think these boys are to be congratulated on their demonstration and what they have been able to bring out. Now that it is started off with this demonstration and Mr Bur - lingham mentioned some 4-H champions that Nebraska has had this year, I wish to say that that is only the beginning. Tonight at the dairymen's banquet Mr. Frisbie will introduce two national champion dairy teams. MR. MORTON: 1 wish to call your attention to the individual breed meetings to be held tomorrow morning. We will have the Ayrshire Breed Association in room 208 A; the Brown Swiss in room 209; the Nebraska Guernsey Breeders Association in room 206; the Holstein - li'.esian Association in room 204; and the Nebraska Jersey Cattle Uub , n room 207. All the rooms are in this building. Now we have come to the last of our program. I expect it is only proper and fitting that I should tell my experiences in regard to this part of the program. Mr. Davis, as you know, was in Europe last summer and spent a great deal of time seeing what he could learn there. When it came my turn to get a program for the Rotary Hub ,n Beatrice, I called on Mr. Davis to tell something of his European trip. He has spent much time in preparing slides and material as to what he had seen in Europe. I am sure from th» comments that were made by the Rotary Club that you ar e going to enjoy this illustrated lecture. May I present Mr. H P Davis in an illustrated lecture on "Impressions of European Agriculture." MR. DAVIS: When an inlander from the United States first views Europe he discovers an amazingly different environment and many things-landscape, cities, people, houses, customs, and agricultural practices that are unlike those to which he has been accustomed. At first the reaction is one of amazement that the European should be so different. As the matter is given more consideration the reasons for these differences come to light. In the first place one must appre - cate that Europe is very old, and the present peoples have adopted some customs and habits through successive centuries that we in our </seg>
         <seg id="p301">V Nebraska State Dairymen's Association j ;¦ newer environment have never acquired. Some idea of the age of the - civilization of jEurope is gained from the age of some of the cities. Berlin, for example, a modern city of more than four million people celebrated its I seven hundredth birthday with great pageantry this - year. Rome was founded about 56 8.C.,. London had a settlement of !sorts! about 60 A. D. and sO on. When one remembers the various ! tides of conquest, the influx; of peoples from various lands/it is easy to understand how the present day inhabitants of Europe should have been influenced in various ways and should have acquired some characteristics'of life. i To appreciate a little the conditions in Europe one must remember that the standard of living is vastly different from that existing in this'country. JThe average wage of the worker in agriculture or in industry is appreciably lower than prevails in this country. While in many! cities there has been much new building to furnish better hous - ing,, most of the people live in buildings that were constructed anywhere from, three hundred to one hundred years ago. As a con - sequence the light, heat, ventilation, and sanitary arrangements were those!.that prevailed at the time of construction and it is easy to understand why the houses and barns have thick walls with little light | and almost no ventilation. The average European either walks or! rides a bicycle: and many persons have never travelled more than a fe\v miles from home. The automobile is a luxury, far beyond the reach of the average man. There is one automobile for every twenty people jas compared with one for every four people in this country. Automobiles pay a very high license fee amounting to a pound, (five dollars) for each S. A. E. horsepower per year in ! England, and gasoline varies, but is about 45 cents or more a gallon. ' Radios are usually licensed and one pays a rather heavy yearly tax to I listen to governmental broadcasts or propaganda Usually sugar,. J cigarettes, and; matches are rather heavily taxed, (and butter, meat, j - and fruit 'are [often exceedingly high in price Milk is little used as. j- a I beverage and ice cream is just beginning to be popular. Then too - in some of the| countries many, many persons, especially in the rural districts do not [know how to either read or write. When one understands 1. these'things then the picture becomes a little clearer. Two things are i particularly impressive to the European visitor, namely, the large number of castles which were in truth fortresses, and!the many, many fine churches. ! The castles, some of them dating back to the Roman era are often beautiful to look on but terrible to live in. They are i. relics of the age when a strong fortress gave protection against : attack. The churches, many of which are tremendous in size, are mute testimonials to forced labor in some cases, to man's desire for higher things. ! The church in these earlier years was the chief spon - sor of art and learning, as well as the guardian of morals and the only source of knowledge. : ..;'. </seg>
         <seg id="p302">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture On a trip to Europe, whose primary purpose was to serve as an official delegate to the XI World's Dairy Congress held at Berlin, Germany, the last full week in August, 1937, I had the opportunity of seeing something of Germany, Denmark, Holland, Switzerland, Italy, France, England, Scotland, and the Island of Jersey. While the trip did not permit an intensive study, it was possible to make certain observations. Visits were made to the Dairy Research Insti - tute at Kiel for the State of Prussia, and at Orienburg for the Kur - mark of Bradenburg, both in Germany; the Agricultural College con - nected with the University of Copenhagen in Denmark; the Institute of Experimental Zootechnie at Rome, Italy; the experimental farms &#132; of the Institute of Animal Genetics of the University of Edinburgh and of the East of Scotland Agricultural College near Edinburgh in Scotland; the Hannah Dairy Institute and the West of Scotland Agri - cultural College both located near Ayr, Scotland; and the National Institute for Research in Dairying, at Reading, England. In addition I visited the herd book offices of the Red Danish Cattle Society in Copenhagen and a country estate in Denmark; and the West Friesian Cattle Society at Leeuwarden, The Netherlands; the Ayrshire Herdbook Society for Great Britian and Ireland at Ayr, Scotland and a number of breeders in the locality as well as various herds on the Island of • Jersey. At the World's Dairy Congress at Berlin there were represented 60 countries of the world with a total, including women and children, of more than 3000 in attendance. With such a group there were three official laguages, German, French, and English, and it was remarkable how well the language handicap was overcome. There was a week of meetings and in connection with the meetings, at the fine large exposition grounds, was held a dairy exposition with dairy exhibits showing the dairy conditions and products from more than a score of countries. Butter and many kinds of cheese were ex- ' hibited in great glass-faced refrigerators, each country showing its j products. Dairy machinery and technical apparatus lined the aisles- '. j and in one part of the exposition building was assembled an exhibit | of the progress of dairying through the centuries as revealed through •! paintings, etchings, etc. The Germans put on an exhibit of three j fine cows representing the more common dairy breeds in Germany, '! such as: Black and White (Holstein-Friesian); Brown Swiss; Angeln; 7) Red and White (a red and white Holstein); a solid colored fawn mountain breed; a solid red breed; a spotted breed (Simmental). These cows, three for a breed, were exhibited in an open pavilion with the lifetime records of the cows displayed on signs above them. The caretakers wore their native garb, which in the case of the Swiss and Bavarians, were short leather pants with bare knees. The pains j and care with which the dairy exhibits were prepared are indicative j of the interest in agriculture that is being exhibited by the Reich. </seg>

In Germany, the decree has been issued that all dairy cattle are to be tested for production. That this is quite a stupendous task does not deter the mthorities who confidently predict that J6O per cent of all the cows will have production records this year j and 80 per cent will be tented next year. Along with this is being carried on a testing program for tuberculosis and Bang's disease! The preliminary figures md .ate that there are about .ten per cent of the cattle suf - fering from the latter disease. Milk and Milk products are being recognized as essential to good health and Germany now has a health S°al-: '.-¦- .'. | : ! This same interest of the government in dairying was manifested in! Italy aid in England. Doubtless there was such interest in the other countries, but it was not so apparent. The j European govern - ments are all interested in making their countries as nearly self sufficient a 3 possible from the agricultural standpoint and in furthering that policy there is a recognition of the fact that the dairy cow is the most efficient farm animal and that milk and dairy products are essential in the diet. - Breeds . - j Europe has some of the same breeds of dairyj cattle with which we are acquainted in this country, but it has in addition other breeds some of which have a rather wide distribution that are entirely foreign to American eyes. I The Black and White breed which has the same general origin as the Holstein-Friesian in this country is found rather widely dis - tributed over western Europe. In Germany it is called 'Schwarzbuntes Tieflandvieh and Ostfriesisher; in Holland the Friesch Rundvee; and in other 1 countries various titles such as Holland Cattle, Dutch Cattle - and Black and White Cattle." While, of course, there was some varia - tion, in general, this black and white breed was much alike in the several countries. Both cows and bulls have |Very straight top lines and level rumps. The cows tend to have longer fore-udder attach - ments and not so high an attachment behind as compared with our own black and white animals. The cows and bulls are much rounder in rib and not so sharp at the withers. The thighs tend to be full and well fleshed on both males and females, but the bulls particularly show heavy fleshing. The hooks and pin bones are not so prominent and aTe better covered 7 with flesh. In size both males and females tend to have somewhat shorter legs and weigh somewhat less than animals in this country. This black and white] breed as seen in ! Friesland in and around Leeuwarden was particularly smooth over all parts and since this Is an important exporting center it is likely that the type represented by the animals in this section indicated the type' desired. In general the; percentage of butterfat in the </seg>
         <seg id="p304">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture milk of black and white cows was similar to that in this country although certain breeders in Holland are making what appears to be a successful attempt to breed for cows producing four per cent fat in their milk. The Brown Swiss, known also as the Graubaunes Hohenvieh in Germany, seem to be reasonably popular but the animals in Europe are not so refined as the type which is exhibited in the shows in the United States being somewhat heavier in bone and showing a rough top line. The Brown Swiss seem to be quite well distributed and were generally esteemed. The breed which seemed to have the widest distribution through western Germany, Switzerland, Normandy, and Northern Italy is the Sinimental. This breed also is known by various names in various countries such as the Hohenfleckvieh in Germany and Normandy cattle in France. The live weight of the cows of this breed varies from 1320 lbs. to IH7O lbs. In color they vary from a light lemon fawn to a red with white spots, usually the legs are white as is the underline. Oftentimes the head is mostly white. This breed has a very fine reputation throughout Europe as a hardy breed that gives a modest quantity of milk. It seems to be quite well suited to the general situation where the heifers and sometimes even the cows furnish the hauling power for the farm work. Good average cows produce somewhere around GOOO to 7000 pounds of milk with a test of between 3.5 to 4'/ butterfat. In general the animals tend to be heavy boned with heavy heads and somewhat coarse and rough over all parts. The animals flesh rather readily and do not show evidences of extreme dairy type. Rotbuntes Tieflandvieh is a breed with all the characteristics of the black and white Fricsian cattle except that the colors are reddish brown and white usually with white legs and switch. These animals apparently have the same general characteristics as their black and white relatives from which they probably differ only in color. It is interesting to note that in Friesland some of the red and white cattle are registered in a herd book where black and white cattle are registered. Animals; of each color are registered separately and crosses between the two are not eligible for registry. Mitteldeutches Rotvieh are a breed of cattle found in Germany, solid red in color looking from that standpoint very similar to the Red Polls. Cows will weigh between 1250 and 1400 pounds and tend to be a little rough over most parts. This breed tests around 4% and produces a moderate amount of milk. Apparently they are not widely distributed. The Angeln is a race of small reddish brown cattle, the cows weighing from 850 to 1100 pounds. They are solid color and have </seg>
         <seg id="p305">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association some resemblance to. our Jersey cattle being more angular than any of the other breeds. The bone is fine and they produce a moderate quantity of milk testing about 4%. In general this is rather a local breed confined to Schleswig and Holstein, provinces in ithe northwestern part of Germany. There are (some reasons to believe that this breed is related to the Red Danish breed. "-¦'' " ¦ | Another race in Germany is the Einfarbiggelbes Hohenvieh. This is a highland race yellowish fawn in color not unlike the Guernsey. The race differs from the Guernsey in that they are solid in color, have heavy bones, heavy heads, and in general conformation are more like the Brown Swiss. They produce only a moderate quantity of milk! which tests about 3.75% fat. ] The Red Danish breed found principally in Denmark is one of the youngest of the dairy cattle breeds in the world for it can trace its history back less than one hundred years. Due, j however, to the systematic methods with which the animals have been bred in Den - mark there is good reason to believe that the breed has the factors for milk production as well, if not better fixed in the hereditary makeup, than any other breed. This has come about through rigorous selection based upon production records. The Red Danish cow of today weighs about 1300 pounds, is solid cherry red in color and tends to be a little rough over all parts. She does not show extreme dairy type but does have good quality in the udder and a reasonably good udder attachment. On the average the breed produces milk that tests about 4%. Efforts are being made to increase the percentage of butterfat and these are meeting with considerable success. A genetic analysis of the animals in the breed is made each year by the[ herd book office and this is published and is therefore available to the breeders who in that manner have a basis for selection. It does not appear that the Red Danish breed has been very widely distributed to the other countries, but this may have been due to the fact' that they have had few surplus cattle for export. i A breed of cattle which is of considerable interest in south - eastern Europe is the breed called in Russia and Hungary, The Steppe breed, in Italy called the Maramana. This breed is used very little for dairy purposes, its usefulness being confined very largely to draft. The animals are rather slow to mature, very large in size, mature cows often reaching 5 to 5% feet at the withers. In colorj they are a light gray shading darker around the neck and head with the underline being of a lighter hue. They are heavy headed, heavy boned animals which can stand great extremes of temperature and apparently are capable ,of surviving under very unfavorable conditions. They are used primarily for draft and for beef since their J milk production is very small. - </seg>
         <seg id="p306">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Throughout England the prevailing breed of cattle is the Shorthorn. Shorthorns in England are largely what we would call dairy Short - horn type although there are beef Shorthorn herds. The dairy Short - horns seen in England appear to be smoother in conformation and to have better udders than the average dairy Shorthorns seen in this country and greater attention has been given to breeding an animal who will produce milk profitably. In the County of Ayr one can see the Ayrshire cow in her native heath. Over this hilly roiling country with its salt spray blown in from the sea and its rather chill damp climate the Ayrshire breed has been developed to a high degree of perfection. The cows seen in that region tend to be very straight in top lines with deep smoothly hung barrels and long level udders. Ayrshire breeders are paying particular attention to animals that have good legs as one seldom sees any evidence of crooked hocks. The Ayrshire breeder likes to have a cow with a head of moderate length and good dish. On the Island of Jersey, the Jersey cow has reached her perfection of form. In that environment the animals have unusually level top lines and very long level udders. Greater attention is apparently being paid to these two points than to any others. The animals seen there are certainly marvels of beauty. One is somewhat disappointed, however, at the lack of interest in the producing ability of the cows on the island. Island Jerseys are considerably smaller than those in this country. Feeding Obviously the practices used in feeding dairy cattle in various parts of Europe show a great deal of variation depending upon the local crops and other natural conditions. It is, however, the well established practice of European farmers to depend to a very large extent upon roughage for their milk production. Cattle are maintained on pasture for as long a period as it is available and then they are placed in tight barns where they remain throughout the winter with seldom any chance to get out into the open air. Probably this custom is a relic of the days when people thought cattle did not give off enough surplus heat to maintain their body temperature in com - fort unless warmly housed. Feeding in different parts of Europe will vary somewhat but the practice used in feeding the cows at the Prussian Dairy Re - search Institute at Kiel, Germany, is perhaps typical of the better practices used in north Germany. The cows at that institution are pastured from May to November. During the first pasture month and the last two pasture months dry beet pulp is fed in addition to pasture. About two kilograms (4.4 lbs.)- is fed to each cow per day, the dried pulp being first soaked in an equal quantity of water. Green </seg>
         <seg id="p307">...j' Nebraska State Dairymen's Association Jr. 'r. ¦ . :¦"-.-.. . kale is available in the fall and this is cut daily and hauled to the cattle until Christmas' time. The amount of this fed daily is about 100 lbs. per cow. In addition sweet yellow lupine fodder is cut from the field and fed green to supply protein. The quantity given is as much as the cow will eat up clean. In the winter the cows are fed up to eleven pounds of grain mixture daily composed of cocoanut meal, soy - bean meal and peanut meal. The ratio of feeding the grain is one pound of grain for every three pounds of milk produced or 50 grams of true protein for every 2.2 pounds of milk. In thejwinter time lupine silage is fed daily, between 60 and 80 pounds per day per cow. This apparently is the chief roughage although the pasiure grass which is cut for hay may be fed if it is available up to 17 pounds per cow per day.. Usually cattle have access to a certain amount of cereal straw Which they are allowed to eat at will. This is likely to'be-barley - straw although it may possibly be wheat straw or oat straw. Potatoes are sometimes fed and a system is followed in some places of treat - ing potatoes with hot water and putting them into 1 a square concrete tank placed in the ground! The principle involved here is that the hot water will tend to change some of the starch in the potatoes to sugar and thus make them somewhat easier to digest. I The calves at the Prussian Dairy Research Institute at Kiel are taken from the cows the first day after birth and! fed one kilogram lbs., of milk, one kilogram (2.2 lbs.) additional is! added for each day so that on the seventh day the calves are getting seven kilograms or 15.4 lbs. of milk per day in two feedings. This is increased so that the calves are getting eight kilograms (17.6 lbs.) lof milk the third week and nine kilograms (19.8 lbs.) of milk daily the fourth week. Be - ginning with the third week skimmilk is substituted the change being ijiade gradually. The skimmilk feeding is continued until the calf reaches ! a weight of 110 kilograms (242 lbs.). Calves at the same time are being fed roughage and a certain amount of grain, usually barley. : '¦'"':.-.•¦ -¦! ' ¦'. -' '. '¦¦¦¦¦¦ •.'•-, ¦-:-¦ | The feeding of cows in Holland and Denmark is not greatly different from the practice in northern Germany 1. In Denmark a milk cow will receive 88 lbs. of swedes (turnips) or mangolds (Man - ge's), 8.8 lbs. of straw, and 2.2 to 4.4 lbs. of hay daily plus a grain mixture composed largely of high protein concentrates. The pasture season is longer in Holland and a great deal of dependence is placed upon grass silage and roots for winter feed. Beet pulp is utilized as a source of roughage and it may be fed wet when the farm is located close to the factory or the dry beet pulp soaked may he used if the farm is a considerable distance from the beet factory. The feeding practices for cows in and around Rome in Italy is somewhat different and a longer pasture season is available although the pastures are not so nutritious or as good as,are found in the </seg>
         <seg id="p308">Report of Nebraska State Board of Acriculture northern part of Europe. Corn is grown in Italy and corn silage is available. A certain amount of A. I. V. silage is used on the larger farms, the silage being usually some grass mixture. For winter feeding in the more progressive dairies, silage and legume hay principally alfalfa will furnish the chief roughage. Where beets are grown they will be used and a certain amount of grain which will probably consist of com mixed with some high protein concentrate such as cottonseed meal, linseed oil meal, sesme oil meal, soybean oil meal, etc. In Normandy the pasture of the early part of the summer is sup - plemented by peas and vetch and the animals are tethered on this in the early fall. In Scotland great dependence is placed on pastures which are carefully tended and furnish a very large amount of nutrients for dairy cows. In the winter time grass hay is fed together with silage made from oats and peas or some other cereal grain. Roots here form an important part of the winter food supply but instead oi being sugar beets they are more likely to be turnips. The better Scotch dairymen make an effort to feed a balanced ration of grain in the winter time and there is a greater appreciation of the importance of protein in the ration in this section than in many other parts oi the world. Along the coast of Scotland the salt spray coming off the sea and settling on the grass is usually sufficient to furnish all the salt needed by the average dairy cow. Much has been done in England in studying the use of dried grass. Grass which is cut in the early stages of its growth while it may contain a great deal of moisture does not contain a very much higher percentage of protein than it does at a later stage of growth. For example, a green grass or one of the cereal crops cut when immature will often contain as much or more protein than alfalfa. Fine results have been obtained in England in the use of dried grasses, the drying being accomplished by an artificial drier. So far this drying of grasses has not been developed so as to be a prac - tical method of utilizing grass to furnish more protein in the ration. A method of preparing corn in which it is steamed and rolled is very popular in England and is fairly widely used. The English also arc emphasizing the use of animal proteins in the ration for dairy cattle. Their study indicates that they are much more efficient than many of the plant proteins. On the Island of Jersey the pasture season is from nine to ten months and may even be longer than that in certain instances. When the animals are not on pasture they are fed a cattle cabbage which grows to the height of three or four feet on a rather stiff stalk. Roots are also used and various grain mixtures are fed which bring up the protein content. </seg>
         <seg id="p309">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association i'.'iln general I think it might be said that our European friends have made excellent progress in nutrition, but it is questionable whether the average farmer does a very much better job jof feeding than is done in this country. I do believe that in the British Isles the live stock are better fed than in most other parts of the world, the English and Scotch believing that if livestock are to be kept, they must be properly fed. •'.'.,! Housing Dairy Cattle i- . : ¦ In the matter of housing dairy cattle our European friends are way behind. On the continent it is still; the customary arrangement for' the animals to be housed in a stable which has almost no light . and has very heavy walls with no openings for ventilation. As a result animals which are kept for several months each year in such an environment are prone to develop various diseases and tuber - culosis is very rampant in Europe. In Germany, Switzerland, and Italy there is still a considerable discussion over! whether the plat - form on which the cow stands should be of such length that her feet are right on the edge of the gutter (short stall) or whether it j should be considerably longer. Probably this discussion comes about I because it is not the practice in Europe to remove thejCow from the ! stall into separate pens for calving. A cow once placed in a stall in the | autumn is likely to remain in that particular. place all winter. The i newer stables in the more up-to-date farms on the continent do have more light and ventilation. The construction in England and Scotland is!likely to be much heavier than in the United States but in gen - eral greater provisions are made for light and ventilation than is true on the continent. Very often the Scotch barns (byres) are only •wide enough to permit two rows facing out with a walkway and gutters on each side. There is no place for feeding the cows except from the back. A new scheme of ventilation is used in England in some places arranged by leaving the roof open for about a foot along the entire length ,of the barn at what; Would be the ridge. Great claims are made for this system of ventilation,which probably is well suited to the English climate where it never gets very cold. ¦¦". | In general concrete is used for stall floors although many different compositions particularly those involving rubber and asphalt are being tried out in various countries. I As a general rule cows are fastened in stalls oy means of either chains or ropes around their necks. These chains or ropes are usually attached by means of a ring to an up-right rod. This permits the cow to get up and lie down with reasonable freedom of movement within the stall. Individual water troughs have become fairly com - mon in the better farms in England and Scotland. </seg>
         <seg id="p310">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture' Breeding Dairy Cattle We of the United States can study carefully the methods that are being practiced in various European countries in the breeding of dairy cattle. Perhaps the most remarkable progress in the development of a dairy breed has been made in Denmark in the development of the Red Danish breed. This breed of cattle is only about 60 years old and yet, when the average production of the race "is considered, today it probably has the highest average production of any breed anywhere. The four measures which have been of greatest importance in the development of cattle breeding in Denmark are: bull clubs; the keeping of herd books; the competition between whole herds; and the testing for production. These measures were started about 1881 and have been followed since that time with only minor modifications. The cattle shows also have been an important aid in developing this breed of dairy cattle, but it must be understood that the awards at these shows are made on a much different basis than is followed in the United States. As an example, in the case of bulls, aged one to five years, each individual is judged separately and is ranked in degree from one to four in degrees of excellence that means that a number of animals may be ranked in the first degree depending on the quality of the animals. The bulls receive one prize for their appear - ance or conformation and one for inheritance. This latter prize is made up from a number of points based on the conformation of the parents plus a number of the points for the yield of the parents. An estimate is formed of the productive ability as shown in the pedigree based on four generations. This pedigree analysis weighs the sire and dam most heavily and preceding generations are assigned less influence. Bulls over five years of age are only awarded prizes base - on their progeny. Thus bulls from five years to six years old are awarded prizes based entirely on the physical appearance and con - formation of their progeny while bulls over six years of age are awarded progeny prizes based on both the conformation and yield of their progeny. In no case is a bull eligible to compete for such prizes unless 66% of all the progeny over one year of age are present at the time of the award. For cows, prizes are awarded for each individual animal when the herd does not exceed eight animals. In the case of larger herds the judging is done on the basis of a group. In herds up to twenty cows there must be at least three cows entered in the competition and in herds of twenty to thirty cows there must be four cows entered and in larger herds proportionately more animals must be shown. The cows receive one prize for conformation and one for yield. Heifers are awarded prizes either as individuals or in groups according to rules similar to those used for cows. As a result these shows have proved an important means of improvement since approximately 6000 </seg>
         <seg id="p311">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association bulls and 10,000 cows or from 7% to 8% of the entire stock of the country are awarded prizes every year. .About 92 per cent of the herds in Denmark consist of less than 15; cows and these herds comprise about 70 per cent of all the cows. As a result of these small herds and the great interest of the Danish farmer in making improvement in his livestock, the bull clubs or as it!is called in the United States, The Cooperative |Bull Associations, early made their appearance. These cooperative bull associations have increased in importance as the years have passed and by means of this cooperation it has been possible, for the small farmer of Den - mark to have the use of exceptionally good sires. To show the extent of the movement at the present: time, it might be mentioned that there are more than 11O0: such cooperative bull associations in operation. This number of 1100 includes only the larger organizations and does not take into account; groups of from two to five farmers who co - operatively own herd sires. Through the use of ] the best bulls it has been possible in the course of the last twenty-five to thirty years to' increase the average annual yield of butterfat per cow about 175 pounds. Another measure! which has been of vital importance in the development of dairy cattle breeding in Denmark is the keeping of herd books: Herd books in Denmark are not! kept primarily to record the purity of the breed except as they may prove useful to the farmer in the mating of the cows. Danish herd books have some peculiar features and have four divisions, one the family herd book which! is kept by the livestock advisor of the agricultural societies and contains all information about animals belonging to the best herds together with, their pedigrees. When breeding |animals are regu - larly sold from a herd for use in other herds and the quality of the herd is deemed to be so good as to be classed with the elite herds, the agricultural society approves the herd for entry in a family herd book &lt;md the adviser draws up and completes a family herd book of it. The registered herd book is a printed herd book comprised mainly of young animals the minimum age being one year. In order to be admitted the bulls must have been awarded prizes at the cattle shows and the cows and heifers must have come from herds included in the family herd books. &gt; That means in the case of animals of dairy breeds the production must have been controlled by a recognized milk recording society. The cow herd book contains only cows of good reliable family in breeding herds of which family herd books ar\__^-— "* kept. The mothers of the nearest generations must have K2d records made in milk recording societies. The cows admitted must be of good conformation, typical of the breed, and must] have had at least three years of production records. For two successive years each cow must have yielded a total of 880 pounds (40. kilograms) of '•'.¦¦¦'¦-¦'. )..-¦¦"¦-' ..... </seg>
         <seg id="p312">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture butterfat and the average annual yield during all the controlled years must have at least 200 kilograms of butter or 352 pounds of butterfat. The annual yield of butter in kilograms must be equal to the chest measurement of the cow in centimeters. The content of the fat must be at least 4. , however, the percentage of fat may be as many times 1/100 below 4'U as the figure representing the average yield of butter in kilograms is in excess of 200. Of the progeny of the cow at least one must have met the requirements for admission to the register herd books and the daughters who have calved must have had a yield for their age which would correspond to 200 kilograms of butterfat per year. The bull herd book records only ¦ superior older bulls of good pedigree possessing distinct typical features and those having been awarded prizes. The yield of the mother and both grandmothers must have been recorded. A bull for entrance must have been awarded prizes for his progeny with first class-first degree, first class-second degree, or second class-first degree, and information must have been furnished as to the influence of the bull on the yield of the progeny. Thi* latter point namely the influence of the bull on the yield of the progeny can be studied because all milk recording societies which receive a government grant must file a report each year to the Provincial Federation of Agricultural Societies on the annual yield of each cow, her calving date, her pedigree, which means that records are available on seven to eight million individual cows. From this data new progeny performance tests for more than 300 breeding bulls are published anuually showing the comparison between the daughters and the dams. As a result of all these measures it has been possible for the Danish farmer to develop a race of cattle which are of considerable uniformity, pro - ducing high yields of milk and butterfat and have enabled them to compete successfully in the large markets of the world in the production of dairy products. Somewhat the same methods are used in Friesland by the Friesian breeders in Holland the Scottish breeders of Ayrshire in Scotland. General Agriculture One cannot help but be impressed with certain characteristics of European agriculture. First and foremost is the general attitude thut the farming practice must be such that it can be continued indefinitely and still maintain the soil fertility and produce profitable returns. With these things in mind manure is conserved as being one of the valuable products of animals on the farm. Fertilizers are more largely used and grass is recognized as one of the important agri - cultural crops and as such great care is taken in the fertilization and general care of grass land. Second, cows are considered as useful animals and as such have more uses than we practice in the United States. Cows are used lor </seg>
         <seg id="p313">i ¦'¦.' - Nebraska State Dairymen's Association milk, beef, and draft and sometimes for all three j purposes on the same farm. Because of the intensive agriculture there are few specialized beef animals and the milk cows carry a smoother covering of beef than is common in this country. '" ! Thirdly, the European .farmer, through generations with having to cope with unfavorable conditions, has developed practices of utilizing all farm products to a better advantage than has been done in the United States. American farmers can gain much by studying European methods although obviously the conditions under which farms are operated are vitally different. MR.

Davis j before the Nebraska Jersey Cattle Club Annual Meeting, Dec. 10, 1937 i To those of us who first visit Europe there is always a feeling of anti :ip atioh for. the Channel Islands that have had such an mi - i terestirg history through the centuries. These islands which accord - ing! to local tradition still belong to Great Britian simply because a former English king forgot to give them back to France, have played an important role in the livestock industry in the United ¦¦-¦' States;- |: .'. 7 The Island of -Jersey, the southernmost of the Channel Islands is located south of England approximately 120 miles by air line from Southampton. All around is that restless body of water called the English Channel. Only about 50 miles from France and having its early history closely connected with that country, it is not surprising that the names on the Island of Jersey are French in character. fl- Perhaps it would-be better to tell of the approach to the island i by air which is the modern way of travel. The Jersey Airways operate during the winter season two planes to Southampton and one plane ¦': to London daily and, of course, there are planes) coming in equal number from those destinations. These planes which will seat 14 persons are run,in several sections and even in September there was I an average of two sections being run for each trip.

Just a little further on one comes tea ¦ I . green spot in the sea, a lovely little island which has a freshness j which is hard to describe. That is the Island of Jersey. In less J than an hour one has come from Southampton to the airport in [| Jersey and then in a few minutes by bus through the tortuous hilly roads to St. Helier, the principal city on the island. Many may = ; think of Jersey as being chiefly devoted to cattle raising, but this is . . not a fact. Potatoes of which there are three crops raised each . year, flowers, tomatoes, and fine fruit such as pears, are important commodities which are sent to the English and French markets from Jersey, and since the depression has seriously affected the market in the United States and Canada for imported cattle, the cattle ' l business has been in somewhat of a slump. ; .1 To describe Jersey one must remember that from the beach on the south there is a general slope towards the northeast where the highest rocky point is located. The land is rolling being hilly in some parts and it is carefully handled because of its value. One can appreciate the necessity for careful farming when it is realized that pasture land is rented for a little more than $60 a year. In general the dairy herds will average a dozen to eighteen with six to ten cows in milk. There are a few larger herds such as the "Oaklands" where Mr. Pence has a herd of perhaps 40 or 50 animals. Because of the value {¦ of the land cattle are seldom allowed to graze at will, but are j tethered by means of a long rope fastened to the horns and attached ' to an iron peg. A common sight, therefore, in the grazing season is I to see a group of cows in a line all eating away at the fine grass. - \ Young animals are tethered in the same manner, but one seldom sees j bulls. This is because comparatively few bulls are kept on the island. The bulls used for service are those believed to be out - standing from a show standpoint and since distances are not far, it is no great difficulty to transport a cow to be bred to any particular bull on the island. I believe there is a regulation by which a man who accepts prizes for his bull at the shows must stand the bull for j public service at a nominal fee. Jersey cows, in the summer, depend j largely upon grass, but as winter comes on they will be fed on cattle 1 cabbage, a variety of vegetable which grows to a height of three I feet on a thick stalk. They will also be given hay made from grass, j some roots and a little cake which will contain a mixture of some : of the high protein concentrates with perhaps barley or possibly corn added. Since the weather does not get very cold, cows with canvas j blankets will be pastured rather late in the fall. The blankets are j much used because of the rather cold raw winds and the frequent cold rains. I 1 1 - 1 </seg>
         <seg id="p315">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association ! Milk on the Island of Jersey is low in price and there is little incentive for feeding heavily. This probably accounts for the fact that comparatively few cows are being tested for production at the present time. Jerseys are raised on most farms because Jersey farmers hope to sell animals for export and the manure is valuable for their crops. There is no reason why animals of any !age may not be shipped from the island, but in actual practice most of, the exporters select animals in the spring or summer after the heifers have fresh - ened with their first calves, for export the following spring or 7 summer. This practice allows the buyer to see the animal after it has been in milk and been shown at the spring and summer shows and the shipment is then made during the following dry period and the animal freshens again in its new environment. There are modifications of this, some older animals and some younger are exported. The export business to the United States is largely done through three or four well known importers who usually operate by having their island -representative take options on promising young animals which they later confirm upon a visit to the island. Mr. J. A. Perree,the president ;.¦'-¦ of the Royal Jersey Agricultural Society and former secretary of that organization represents several American importers. It was my privilege through the courtesy of Mr. J. A. Perree, the proprietor of that well known Jersey breeding establishment called "The Oaklands," to visit quite a number of the herd^ on the island and to get a fair cross section of Jerseys in their native environment. I visited the herd of Mr. Clifford Le Vesconte who lives at ! Sion in St. Johns parish. He has a small herd of 20 head and milks ten cows all of which were, tethered in a field. Of these ten, two were ' reserved, one for Mr. Butler and one for Mr. Bull. I was particularly ,! interested in the two cows he was preparing to show at the Fall Island Parish Show, Dorigen and Kittitas. Both of [these were shows and Kittitas was first over St. John's Parish a day or so later with 7 Dorigen being second. Later at the fall Island show, Kittitas was ! third over the Island. Other herds visited were the Oaklands where I had the privilege of seeing some beautiful cows and the exceptionally 7 fine bull, Wonderful Aim, a bull which seemingly is siring some i very beautiful daughters, of which much is expected.] This bull appears ' to be very popular and his offspring are scattered over the island. It might be mentioned that Wonderful Aim was first over the Island a few years ago. I believe Mr. Peree thinks of this bull as one of .'"' the great sires from his long list of great bulls. Samares Manor, the ;; home of Elizabeth Lady Knott had a fine herd of cows which we were \ -¦..'. shown through the courtesy of the secretary, Major How. This is • one of the large herds on the island numbering about 40 head. The ' cattle were fine in type but a little small all through. Other herds ¦i- visited were Bon Sejour, the farm of Phillip Le Mourant where we ! .7 .--." 71 7.1 </seg>
         <seg id="p316">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture saw some Design bred animals; Le Croix, the farm of Mr. A. P. 1 Ahier, then to the farm of A. J. Richardson near St. Martins where I saw the most outstanding cow of any I had seen on the island. I She had beautiful lines, quality, refinement, and scale. She would § have been in Canada long before this, Mr. John Bull told me, had . it not been for the fact that she is not a regular breeder. Unlike I many of the individuals we saw this particular cow had plenty of I scale as well as smoothness over all parts. | An interesting feature of the trip was the visit to the Fall j Parish Show. This was a combined parish show for St. John and .1 St. Lawrence parishes. By that is meant the two parishes had their \ show in the same field. A Jersey Parish Show is interesting to an American visitor and may be described as follows. A ten acre field is selected and along both sides are stretched ropes or wires on posts to which the animals which are brought in are tied. The man in charge of the show for each parish calls out the classes and there are really two shows going on at the same time since each parish operates its show independently of the other. To make it somewhat more complicated the classes of females under one year of age are judged by a set of two judges for each parish and all females in milk are judged by another set of two judges for each parish. The classes apear to be junior and senior yearlings and two year olds that are not in milk for the younger groups; two year olds in milk, three and four year olds, and five year olds and over, all animals to be in milk for the older groups. The visitor therefore can see four rings at one time, but he will have to be agile for the judges work rapidly. On the average there were about ten animals to a class,. although this varied somewhat. At the start the animals were . paraded around the judges and then were lined-up with heads all in one direction and the judges examined the udders and studied the conformation of the animals. After some consultation possible shifts were made and the awards were given. The average Jersey breeder did not practice what we would call good showmanship since he made little effort to have his animal stand and pose to the best advantage. In most cases he stood about puffing at his pipe non - chalantly waiting for the awards. The awards were in the form of ribbons and unlike the practice in this country, red is first, blue is second and other colors appear down the line, therefore, the winner of the red ribbon is the superior animal. After the individual classes had been placed then the two top animals in each group were brought out, the three younger classes competing for a junior championship and the three older classes for a senior championship. These awards were made not by the original judges, but by two other judges. Judges for the various parish shows are selected by the Royal Jersey Agricultural Society and I should gather from the comments that were made that they were just as subject to error, according to the sideline observers, </seg>
         <seg id="p317">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association as the judges in this country. In this system of judging it not in - frequently happens that an animal which is placed second in the original placings may actually win-a championship,(but that does hot disturb the Jersey, en at all. After the junior and senior champion - ships are placed then a final championship is placed which is called first over the. parish and with this is awarded the possession of a cup. I believe the breeder has to win the silver cup three times to gain permanent possession. The combination -parish show of St. John and St. Lawrence was attended by perhaps 100 to 125 people who braved the raw cold wind to see the judging! As soon as the judging was over animals were loaded back into carts or trailers or in some cases led to their respective homes. -One custom which seems to be quite common in isjand shows is that of bagging up the cows too much. Even the island breeders admit that many udders are ruined by the practice and some importers do not want to buy any animals that have been shown, a situation which may result in some of the best animals on the island not being shown. The type of Jerseys seen on the island is not greatly different from that seen at our larger fairs. One is impressed with line udders and even down toward the end of the line at the parish shows the &lt; cows had unusually fine, flat, level soled udders. If one were to criticize, it might be said that the udders are not attached quite as . high behind as might be desired. In size the animals tend to be quite small and from that standpoint are not as good as our own j". animals. Rumps and loins were universally good, although here and there was a rough rump, The withers were sharp and the forerib j usually blended smoothly into the shoulder. There are fine cattle on the island but if as much attention were paid by the average farmer i' to perfection of form, there would be as many fine looking cows 7 here. As it is our larger shows have just as fine animals in them as there are on the island. ... A disappointing feature of the island cattle was the comparative '¦ lack of interest in the testing for production. Aj few animals are ¦j being tested but even those tested are seldom tested jfor more than one 7 lactation period and some of the prominent breeders are not testing | at all Whether this is due to the depression that has come upon the J island dairy industry, because of the low price of milk or not is difficult I. to say. One might voice the suspicion that the. foreign buyers are not interested in production and the Jerseymeri suit the buyers. ..-..- Certainly any American breeder of Jerseys should visit the island 7 and see Jerseys on their native heath. The trip ] will be a delight jj for the Island of Jersey is a most beautiful summer resort with ite ;} quaint winding narrow roads, high stone walls surmounted by hedges, \ beautiful flowers of all kinds, as a matter of fact Jersey is a gardeners .

         <seg id="p318">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture INTERESTING POINTS ABOUT BLACK AND WHITE CATTLE OBSERVED IN EUROPE Presented by Prof. H. P. Davis before the members of the Nebraska Holstein Friesian Association in their annual meeting, Dec. 10, 1937 The race of cattle which in the United States is called Holstein- Friesian has many designations in Europe. It may be taking too much for granted to say that all black and white cattle seen on the continent of Europe and the British Isles are one race, but there is good reason to believe that such is the case. It is a little easier when discussing black and white cattle with Europeans to refer to them as black and white cattle since there are a great number of local names used to designate such cattle. For example, in Denmark there is the black and white Jutland breed; in Germany the Schwarz - buntes Tieflandvieh; in Holland the Friesian and in other countries you have designations such as Dutch cattle, black and white lowland cattle, etc. There is good reason to believe that all these European black and white cattle had their origin in the low countries bordering on the North Sea, and while they may have been somewhat modified in characteristics in different countries by environmental conditions and methods of breeding they are still fundamentally the same race of animals. American breeders may be interested in the likenesses and dif - ferences which exist in this race of cattle as I observed it in various countries. In general the European black and whites tend to be a little lower set and to carry more flesh over all parts. In Friesland which might be considered the native home of the breed, the animals were particularly straight in top line with strong broad loins and level rumps. Dutch breeders do not care to have the hook bones prominent and prefer to have foreribs which spring out well from the back bone. Sharp withers are not desired and deep thighs such as might be desired by beef cattle breeders are rather favored par - ticularly in the bulls. The cows do not show the same wedge shaped character that is preferred in the United States but tend to be more in the shape of a parallelogram. Breeders wish the barrels to be well-hung and udders have rather Jong attachments in front but are lacking in high attachments behind and are hung well forward. Udders appear to be of good quality and the teats are quite squarely placed. Pendulous udders are not very often seen and unbalanced udders are rare. Animals must stand square on their legs and sickle-hocks are quite uncommon. The necks tend to be somewhat less lean and blend into the shoulders rather smoothly. The heads of the cows are of moderate length with fairly good width between the eyes and a slight dish. Long narrow heads and Roman noses are not desired. More attention is given to color markings than in this </seg>
         <seg id="p319">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. country. The legs must be white in color and the black on the body must be in large blocks rather than in small spots. . Cows on the average weigh around 1250 to 1450 pounds. Bulls are kept in much heavier condition than in the United States and in general conformation are more comparable to the beef Shorthorns than any other breed; Deep thick thighs, and a smooth covering over the back, ribs, and loins are | much desired in the black and white bulls. This emphasizes a point which is important in understanding European agriculture and that is ithat the ultimate end of every cow is beef. European breeders do] not believe that there is any correlation between spareness of form and milk pro - duction, and, in consequence they select for the j type of animal which they desire and which will be suitable for beef when the animal's dairy usefulness is over. The selection !for production is based not upon appearance but upon records of production. '.• j A visit to the office of the. Friesch Rundvee Stamboek which is the herd book of the Friesian Herd Book Society at Leeuwarden, the capital of Friesland, The Netherlands, gave me a little insight into the way this particular breed of cattle is handled in that section of i "-. Holland. It might be mentioned that there are black and white cattle ' registered in other herd books in Holland, but I believe that this particular herd book reports the best of the black and white races : in the Netherlands. An interesting feature was the fact that of the approximately 1000 members who register animals jin.this herd book there were one or two who registered red and white animals. These animals are registered as red and whites and no crossing with black ! and white animals is allowed. ''¦"¦'"¦ ¦-.-.. The system, of registration is quite a bit more complicated than that prevailing in the United States. The birth of the calf is reported -.-.- to the society within a short time after it is dropped. Various reports are made from time to time but the animal must) be inspected and ! scored by an inspector for the society at the time it is about a year - ling. The markings are of course recorded. Entry in the top class in the case of both cows and bulls depends upon a second scoring and the presentation of certain additional data; such as a- comparison of I ¦"• 7 daughters' records with their dams' records for bulls; and the cow's J own record in the case of a cow. Separate lists of preferred or V superior sires are issued by the herd book society from time to time. | in these lists the photograph of the sire is given, [his score on con - .'. '¦¦ formation, his pedigree including production records for all the females J for three generations; a genetic analysis of his daughters' production •i records as compared with their dams; and certain additional data t about the quality of the offspring. With such information available I it' is not surprising that the Dutch breeders are making good progress 'I iii their breeding operations. This progress has been; charted on a . '.-.-1.,-' </seg>
         <seg id="p320">Report of Nebraska State Board of Acriculture graph recently issued by the Friesch Rundvee Stamboek (the herd book society). Thus in 1895 fewer than 1000 cows were tested yearly, the average yield of milk was 4150 kilograms of milk per cow (9130 lbs.) with an average test of 3.00 per cent or 273.9 lbs. of fat per cow. In 1934, 17000 cows were tested and these averaged 4800 kilograms of milk per cow (10560 lbs.) with an average test of 3.65 per cent or 385.44 lbs. of fat per cow. Thus in 37 years the number of cows tested has increased enormously and the average pro - duction per cow per year has increased 1430 lbs. of milk .05 per cent fat and 111.54 lbs. of fat, a truly remarkable record. The herd book society published a list of 50 cows that had in five lactations exceeded 25000 kilograms of milk (55000 lbs.) and 1000 kiilograms of butter 12200 lbs.). The largest record of this group was for the cow Geertje de Hoop HI 79820 with a total production of 33019 kilograms of milk (72641.8 lbs.), 1530 kilograms of butter (3344 lbs.). Everyone is familiar with the fine ceramic work of the Dutch particularly that around Delft. It was interesting, therefore, to note that the herd book office had tile plaques, tile fireplaces, and even sections of the wall in tile. These tile had figures of various famous black and white animals burned into them and the whole effect was very interesting and artistic. Unfortunately the secretary and the assistant were not in. but 1 was very hospitably received by some of the other officials. Through their courtesy and arrangements a visit was made to two herds in the vicinity that were rather out - standing since both were well known breeders and both were important exporters of cattle. Cattle from these herds had been sent to Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Baltic provinces of Russia, Siberia, France, Belgium,' England, Spain. Portugal, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru! Argentine, Australia, and Java. The first one visited was that of Mr. J. S. van de Woude at Deersum about 15 miles from Leeuwarden where the herd book office is located. Mr. van de Woude is a man in his seventies who has bred black and white cattle for more than 50 years and is considered one of the best breeders in Friesland. His farm of 28 hectares, a little over 60 acres, is mostly in grass and his chief income comes from his 30 cows which are milked. He has, in addition, about 35 head of young stock and a herd bull. In general he plans to have the cows freshen in February and March. At that time beets are fed together with grass silage and a little cake. By cake is meant some high protein concentrate such as cottonseed meal, soybean meal linseed meal, sesme oil meal, etc. The cows are kept on pasture for about 8 months of the year. Pastures do not have fences, the little canals taking the place of fences. Occasionally there is a gate at a little bridge over a canal, but otherwise one can look across a considerable area and perhaps see a dozen herds but no apparent means of separa- </seg>
         <seg id="p321">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association' - tion. It is a surprising thing that the cows do not cross some of the small ditches, but the reason that they do not is because those that cross immediately go to the butcher. Mr. van de Woude's cattle were a very excellent group with nice lines and'good evidences of production. For example, one cow produced 22066 j lbs.- of milk, 717 lbs. of butterfat with an average test of 3.25% in 330 days; another cow produced 20451 lbs. of milk, 634 lbs. of butterfat \yith a test of 3.1 % in 325 days; a third cow produced 18702 lbs. of milk, 675 lbs. of butterfat with an average test of 3.61% in 325 days. The average production of: Mr. van de Woude's herd last year with an average length of lacta - tion of 319 was 12371 lbs. of milk, 445 lbs. of butterfat with a 3.6% test at an average age of 4 years. Certainly this is a splendid average production for a herd of cows which depends very largely upon grass supplemented with beet pulp, beets, and silage for its feed and is only milked twice daily. ' ; In the herd of Mr. D. H. Schaap, a next door neighbor, I had a chance to visit one of the members of an exporting firm. Mr. Schaap is developing animals a little more like the type common in the United States. . In other words he has animals which are a little more spare in form. He also is making a special effort to breed a race of animals that will test 4% or even higher and apparently is having some success in his efforts. Mr. Schaap told us that he owned the cow that had the highest lifetime production of any cow in Holland, in fact I believe he said in the world, but in that latter statement I believe he was taking in a little too much territory. This cow according to the figures he gave me produced in 9 lactations 157317 lbs. of milk, 6363.3 lbs. of butterfat with an average test of 4.04 per cent. Her largest record was 28771 lbs. of milk, 1161 lbs. of butterfat and her average for nine lactations was 17499 . lbs. of milk, 707 lbs. of butterfat. Unfortunately I did not.see this cow, but she must be a great individual and they are still hoping that she will continue to breed and produce another calf. I looked oyer the pedigrees of several cows and bulls in Mr. Schaap's herd and tabulating all records on the dam side I found that there were few of them that had tests of below 4 per cent. So it seems likely that he is actually making excellent progress towards his goal of a 4 per cent test. .-.-.-.¦ One cannot observe the black and white cattle in a European environment without wondering if the breeders in the United States could not adopt some of the methods that have proved so successful there. Any system that will raise the average milk production 1400 lbs. of milk and 111 lbs. Of butterfat per cow for ja breed average, in the course of 3/7 years must have some merit; jWhy not try the same methods hero? ... </seg>

During seven years of 4-H dairy club work I have had many interesting experiences, all of which have had a bearing on my destiny as a member of the 1937 winning 4-H dairy judging team in Nebraska As this was my last year for a chance at this honor, due to age limitations, I consider myself extremely fortunate. My team mates and myself were even more fortunate, however, in receiving the trip </seg>
         <seg id="p325">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association to the National Dairy Show which was made possible only by your generous contributions.' Much as the average farm youth, I had been practically all my life within the borders of my own state and although there are many interesting places in Nebraska, I did see many objects of interest on our trip to Columbus, Ohio which I had often heard about and had seen only in pictures. Those which probably interested me most were the coal mines, the streams of clear water fed by springs, the groves of hard wood trees and, of course, the Mississippi river with its numer - ous fiat boats, and many others too .numerous to mention. I noticed that the people of the larger eastern cities are definitely different than we, in that they move, either in cars or when walking, much faster than we of the middle, west. They seem also to be more self-centered and less friendly unless you are intimately acquainted with them. It Was very evident in lowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio i that they have been enjoying much better crops than we. .The build - j'-".-:''. ings are well kept and many freshly painted. In some of the very i prosperous sections the farmers even have their fence posts painted. .-.-".-- "'.'"¦¦•' '¦ :' ¦ ! ¦•' '"..'•¦ I i . Although we. observed many points of interest,' we did spend some time in judging cows from very fine herds. Judging classes of cows of all five dairy breeds at the University of Hlinois was probably one of the most educational experiences . I had on the trip, as many of the states' 4-H Dairy judging teams, like we, were there trying to learn more about dairy cows.' I t When we arrived in Coiumbus we went directly to the Hotel Fort Hayes, at which we were to room, during our stay at the National Dairy Show. Of course the 4-H judging]contest was our center of interest and which we are mighty proud to- have won. Win or lose, there is much to be learned about cows in a contest of that kind due to the fact that some of the best cows in the United States are in the classes to be judged. During our stay of three and one-half days there was always something of interest going! on, as team members from thirty - ! seven states were a constant source from which we could acquire much information concerning their activities as 4-H club members and about . their home states. Visiting the Omar Bakery, taking a trip around the city of Columbus, banquets, one at iwhich we received our awards and visiting the National Dairy Show were the chief sources of entertain - ment which was ours to enjoy while we were in Columbus. It is impossible for me to tell you concerning all the information. ' education and recreation which was made possible for my team mates ( and myself on this fine trip which you made possible for us. It is J likewise impossible for me to thank you enough for the trip, and the ,i medals and prizes which I won while there.

         <seg id="p326">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture your interest and contribution that we could represent Nebraska at the National Dairy Show this year. Respectfully yours, Harold Walkup 4-H Dairy Cattle Judging Team York, Nebraska I wish to thank your Association for helping make possible my trip to the National Dairy Show which was held in Columbus, Ohio this year. The trip has been a grand experience and it was educational in several ways. First, I saw a part of our United States which is noted for raising the corn with high yields. Not only did the corn impress me but the trees and grass were something that are not very im - pressive around our neighborhood. Secondly, we were able to see the Agricultural School of fllinois and the wonderful layout they had there for a school. Third, being able to attend the National Dairy Show I got a much larger knowledge of interest that is taken in the produc - tion of the leading dairy herds in the country, and another thing, being able to see some of these wonderful show cattle. There were many other things we saw both at the Show and on the trip that I shall never forget. Again I wish to thank you. Very truly yours, Donald Tracy 4-H Dairy Cattle Judging Team York, Nebraska I wish to tell you at this time how much I appreciated the fine trip and the fine time we had at the National Dairy Show. It was a trip and an experience I shall remember the rest of my life. Even though I have been a member of the 4-H clubs for only two years, I have found after this trip to the show, that it was worth all the work I put into it and also very educational. I met many other members of 4-H clubs from other parts of the country and learned how they also were trying to make the farm a better place on which to live and also some of their ideas of the 4-H club. I also found out that the more judging of dairy cows I do the better I like dairying, and also this trip has convinced me I should go on to college for a higher education. I wish to thank all the people at this time for the fine trip we had and also for the fine time. The things that stick most in my mind were the fine dairy cattle </seg>
         <seg id="p327">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association and these cattle also make me wish that some day I may exhibit cattle like those at a National Dairy Show. Then the country we Baw. es - pecially in Ohio and right around Bloomington, Indiana sticks in my mind because of the abundance of feed and all the trees. Thanks again to those who made this trip possible and I hope that ' some time in the future I can help some club member to make as fine or even a better trip, if possible, to the National Dairy Show or some other similar trip. Sincerely yours, ; 7 Harry Silvey 4-H'Dairy Cattle Judging Team York, Nebraska My team mate and I left home on October sth at 4:30 in the morn - ing and went to Lincoln where Mr. Lawritson picked us up and we rode with him the rest of the way to Columbus and back again. We got to Bloomington, Illinois the first night. I went to the show with my team mate. The next morning we all went to Urbana, Illinois to the Illinois Agriculture College farm where it judged cattle along with the judging teams from Nebraska. We'-leftj Urbana about four in the afternoon and stayed at Danville, Hlinois that night. We then went to a Guernsey farm and judged until nearly noon. We were served hot coffee and doughnuts for dinner, at this dairy. After lunch we went on to Richmond, Indiana where we judged at the Rose Hill |" Dairy. We stayed at Richmond; Indiana that might and Friday went on to . Columbus, Ohio and got our rooms at the Fort Hayes Hotel. There I were eleven of us boys in one room called the green room. ¦ On Satur - -7 . day we all went to the Columbus, Ohio Fair Grounds where the Na - tional Dairy Show was held. My team mate and I started to get our material unpacked and ready to give the demonstration while the other; demonstrators got their material ready and the judges started to judge which kept them busy all day. 'It happened that we did not get to give ours until Mon - day, for lack of time. About 5:30 we returned to our hotel and got '} ready for the banquet which was in the hotel across the street. At ¦ ;. this banquet we all had a glass of milk from the world's champion ' Guernsey cow which I also saw down at the Fair Grounds. Sunday morning, some men from the Omar Bakery came and got all of the Nebraska members and took us for a tour of the city and through their large bakery. It was certainly worth while seeing. They let us off at the church which was in walking distance of our hotel. j Sunday afternoon we went on a tour of the Ohio University and had j supper there, after which we had a short program in the auditorium. \ '..-. We went to the demonstration which was the central division of the , C group. We got fifth in our division. </seg>
         <seg id="p328">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture That evening we had supper at the Manamar. This was also given just to the Nebraska group by Omar. After this good supper we went to the Fair Grounds to the horse show after which we saw an indoor polo game, the first polo game I ever saw except in the movies. Tuesday morning my team mate and I went to the grounds and got our demonstration material ready to ship home and then back to our hotel where we packed and got ready to leave right after the banquet Tuesday noon. At this banquet we had a good feed and all awards of the show were given to club members. After this banquet we went to Richmond, Indiana where we stayed for the night. The next day we went out to Rose Hill Dairy where they were having a dispersal sale of all animals. I saw the great bull sold which brought $1,150 and the lowest price calf sold for $35. These were all purebred Holsteins. We left there about 3:15 in the afternoon and drove to Frankfort, Indiana where we stayed for the night. We drove all day the next day and got to Red Oak, lowa where we spent the night, the next day driving on home and had dinner at the Agricultural College Cafe - teria, Lincoln. I got home about 3:45 Friday, October 16th. Of all the country I saw including Nebraska, I will take the country around Peoria, Illinois and on east to Urbana. The crops looked the best to me and so did the landscape. All in all it was the best trip I ever-had and I enjoyed it very much. Sincerely yours Donald Vetter Class A Dairy Demonstration Team Auburn, Nebraska I would like to tell you something about this trip which your Association made possible for me. We left Lincoln on Wednesday morn - ing. We drove all that day in order so we could reach Urbana where the University of Illinois is located the next day. It was very interesting to observe the general conditions of the country which we passed. Even though our corn condition here seemed not good it made a person glad to see crops that were good. That night we stayed in Bloomington, Illinois. The next morning we motored to Urbana where the judging team practiced judging. It was very interesting to see the Illinois University dairy herd and the way they managed them. We also saw the world's champion milk producing Brown Swiss cow. After leaving here we went to other herds which were of exceptional quality. The next several days we continued to visit herds. We finally arrived in Columbus. Here we made our headquarters at the Fort Hayes Hotel. We did not go out to the show until the next morning. The next day at the show the Nebraska teams went to work and the judging team also working hard. The next day we </seg>
         <seg id="p329">Nebraska State Dairymen's Association were happy to learn that our judging team and one demonstration teani won first while our other two teams placed fourth and fifth. We felt that our time had been well spent for this was a good showing. While at Columbus we were taken on a tour of the city to see the various places of interest and also visited various) places of industry. Sunday morning we attended the First Trinity Church which was a very beautiful building. . We were treated to several banquets. One by the State Leaders committee where awards were presented and at another by Servel Elec - trolux Company where we had a swell program. We also were guests of the Ohio State University Club on Sunday afternoon. We were taken on a tour of the campus and given a luncheon in the evening. One evening we attended the horse show. We also were treated to a dinner at the Manamor Restaurant by a well known baking company. We left Columbus on Tuesday and arrived home on Friday. I sure will remember this trip in years to come. Not only was it just to compete in the Dairy Show but it was very educational and enter - taining. We saw many different places of interest and we acquired many new friends. I certainly wish to thank you for this trip which you gave me. Yours very truly, John Oswald '. Class A Dairy Demonstration Team ,:¦. Aurora, Nebraska In appreciation of the courtesies you have shown jus in sponsoring this fine trip to the National Dairy Show, I wish to thank you. OUr trip was not only very interesting but educational because of the beautiful scenery and people I met. Some of the most interesting places I saw were: Illinois' State Agricultural College, Ohio State Agricultural College, Omar Bakery in Columbus, thej best bred Guernsey herd in the United States, and the Rose Hill's sale of purebred Holstein cattle, at Richmond, Indiana. !.'¦".."¦.'.'.

         <seg id="p330">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Words fail to express the sincere feeling of gratitude that fills my heart when I think of the wonderful and educational trip. I am sure it will be a life long memory made possible by your generous interest in 4-H club work, and I sincerely thank you for your part in the program that made our trip an enjoyable one. The trip as a whole included an interesting and varied program, retiring at night with a day of fun past, and the next days program already planned. We passed through states and across country I had never seen before, with beautiful trees in every direction, roads bordered in rich green mats of blue grass, and with attractive farm homes set back from the road made a beautiful scene. At Columbus we had the opportunity of getting acquainted with 4-H boys and girls from all parts of the United States, learning their methods of farming, club activities, and their state as a whole. Then there was the Dairy Show which was very interesting with 4-H activities, including judging and demonstration, the large number of dairy cattle with all breeds present, and the fine horses including draft and gaited breeds. My part in the 4-H club work was giving an ice cream demonstra - tion with Marvin Jones as my team mate. We ranked first in our class of B getting an Elgin watch as first honors which we think a great deal of. After the strain of judging and demonstrations were over we settled down to enjoying the swell entertainment the program com - mittee had planned. Starting first with a 4-H banquet where thirty - eight states were represented, and an interesting program was pre - sented. On Sunday the University 4-H club sponsored a tour of the University Campus, in the evening they presented a program of 4-H origin. Monday we spent the day on the fair ground watching the judging and looking over the exhibits. In the evening we attended the horse show. Here they had a horse that could do several tricks such as side step, lead with one front foot and then the other, and gallop backwards. Tuesday, the last day of our stay in Columbus, was to me very interesting. At noon after a banquet they presented the awards, after which we immediately left for home. We arrived safely home and the pleasant memories of the trip will always cling in my mind so I again wish to sincerely thank you for your part in the trip to make it a very pleasant one.

         <seg id="p358">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture HOME ECONOMICS PROGRAM WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1937 Miss Margaret Fedde, Presiding The Thirty-third Session of the Home Economics .Section of Or - ganized Agriculture was called to order by Miss Fedde, Chairman of the Home Economics Department of the College of Agriculture. The stage setting was beautifully arranged with deep red foliage plants the colors of which blended into the rich red tones of the textile wall hanging. White chrysanthemums were used on the speaker's table, and black candelabra with white candles added a distinctive touch of beauty, Mrs. Altinas Tullis, Music Director of the College of Agriculture, directed the group singing, using songs from the Song-a-Month project and familiar Christmas songs. The audience was asked to stand and to repeat together the Club Uollect. The Collect "Keep us, 0 God, from pettiness. Let us be large in thought, in word in deed, ' Let us be done with fault-finding and leave off self-seeking. May we put away all pretense and meet each other face to face with - out self-pity and without prejudice. May we never be hasty in judgment and always generous. Teach us to put into action our better impulses, straight-forward and unafraid. Let us take time for all things; make us grow calm, serene, and gentle Grant us that we may realize it is the little things that create differ - ences; that in the big things of life we are as one. And may we strive to touch and to know the great common woman's heart of us all; and, 0 Lord God, let us not forget to be kind." —Mary Stewart.

This is the second time within the year and I think it will probably be a privilege that no other president will have </seg>
         <seg id="p359">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture "I have enjoyed being your president and I hope I have been worthy of the office entrusted to me. "Year after year I have attended these splendid programs of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture but until recently I have given little or no thought to the time and effort which must be taken ior their arrangement and completion. As your president I have enjoyecl planning with a group of women whose only thought is to build programs that will interest and help you and me as homemakers. "I wish to thank the women of the Home Economics faculty, the Extension Service and the executive committee whose friendship I have enjoyed during these months. I also wish to express my appreciation to you women of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agricul - ture for the privilege of serving as your president. "Since we are in the midst of the holiday season, a season of Peace'; Joy and Thanksgiving, let us pause and consider the many things for which we have to be thankful. Although our crops in many parts of the state have not,come up to our expectation, our homes and coun - try are not ravaged by war and its desolation, and we can lift our hearts and minds to the Maker and Giver of all gifts without fear, regardless of race or creed. "Let us give thanks.for the line contacts with such splendid women who make up the membership of our organization, for those women who plan and work to make such an organization worth while. Let us not forget that small group, of women who thirty-three years ago saw a vision and had the faith and courage to follow and build for us the foundation !for this section of Organized Agriculture. "Let us be thankful for the opportunity and ability to attend these programs, that we may carry home with us some of the help and in - spiration given here. • "We are 'homemakers' and as homemakers we are the builders of homes. Home—What does it mean to us? A place of Peace, Security, Relaxation, Source of Affection, Gayety and Laughter? The place we love, yearn for, enjoy? Or does it mean confusion, inharmony, hour after hour of petty quarrels, differences, injustices, and misunderstand - ings? We should keep in our minds always that the spirit of the Home is first of all within ourselves. The most stately mansions and rarest of furnishings will not make a home unless there is Peace, and Unselfishness within every heart. Home is not bound by four walls of a house. It is the Heart of Life itself. It is more than preparing the meals arid cleaning the house. It is coriiforting the child, giving peace and harmony to the husband when he is disturbed by the friction without. Efcch tiny task is a brick in the structure of the Home, for which civilization exists.: </seg>
         <seg id="p360">Nebraska Home Economics Association "To build the kind of a home which prepares men and women to go out from it and to take their places as stalwart, upright citizens is our mutual responsibility. In homemaking we not only lay the foun - dation for the physical structure but most important of all we have the privilege and the responsibility of building the spiritual foundation of those who look to us for counsel and guidance. "It is your task and mine to build. And as builders may I leave this thought as expressed by Anna Hamilton Wood in her poem "The Builder": The Builder I would that I might build so well This inner structure where I dwell That evil thinking and deceit And pettiness one may not meet; That all its doors be high and wide That the full measure of my pride Be how 1 welcome all mankind In friendliness of heart, and mind. Vet, tho the Master Builder show The plan in detail and I know Each step beforehand, I may place Some tone amiss and so deface Its beauty. Then, God, give me the strength To tear down and rebuild; at length To offer the completed whole To life —an understanding soul! Exhibit Highlights Miss Fedde: No doubt you have all noticed that we have a very line display of exhibits around the room today. I have asked Miss Mary Runnalls as chairman of the exhibit committee to tell you something about these exhibits before we look at them,—Miss Runnals. Miss Runnalls: I should like to have you know something about the very attractive book exhibit that comes to us from the Nebraska Public Library Com - mission. Miss Clara B. Johnson, who comes from Commission will ex - plain her exhibit to you—Miss Johnson. Miss Johnson: When the program committee of the Home Economics section of Organized Agriculture invited our library to make an exhibit here we </seg>
         <seg id="p361">Nebraska Home Economics Association were glad to accept, for the Nebraska Public Library Commission has many friends and fine patrons in this group of Nebraskans. We offer you a display of hobby books where you may find some - thing to your liking. There are inspirations for hobby riders and hobby hunters, ideas that may be a springboard to your own personal adven - ture. Hobbies are fun and each of us, even though the patterns of our lives seem cut, may choose his own hobby and no one quarrels with him about'it. . There is a wide-range choice of hobby books in the collection at our Library Commission., Your own local library may have many titles to select from, so if days get dull, or if life gets the least bit monot - onous, liven it up by finding a hobby to ride. The more spontaneous and living the interest is, the harder you will pursue it and the greater will be the pleasure and benefit derived. This summer at a reading leaders' training meeting of Home Dem - onstration Clubs the mother of a growing boy asked me if we had any books on marionettes. They were building a little theatre in their home. If she is here today she may be glad to find a book title on the puppet hobby atom- exhibit. ! - You may have noted that reading was one of the hobbies of your honored, Mi\ Lutes. ! 7 One of; the oldest as well as one of the latest hobbies is stamp collecting. You'll find a suggestion for reading on that subject at our booth. | There are many others which may meet your requirements dis - playedihere^ On the screens at each end of the hobby exhibit are explanations of thelservice from our Nebraska Public Library Commission. If books' of any nature are not available in your own community you may be interested in the service from our library! As explained on the screen to the right, books are loaned to schools, to individuals and families, and to community groups. ; Many members of the Home Demonstration Reading Project Clubs are borrowing books through individual loans to read for that program. The screen to the left is devoted to that service. This afternoon during the time scheduled for visiting exhibits, I will be at the Library Commission exhibit and will be glad to answer any questions regarding our service for those of you who are interested. Miss Runnalls: We are always interested in what the 4-H Club girls are doing and I have) asked Miss AHegra Wilkens to tell you about the 4-H exhibit which is shown in the northeast part of this room.

Miss Runnalls: The lovely textile exhibit,has been brought to us by Miss Gladys Winegar, who is educational advisor for the Textiles Education Bureau of New] York City. She will tell us about that exhibit when she talks to us during her demonstration later this morning. In the rear of the room, to the southeast, you will notice some screens »n which are some very interesting posters sent to us from the Nebraska State Health Department. Dr. Thompson of the Maternal and Child Welfare Division of the Department of Health will address us to - morrow on the subject of dental hygiene, eiving us the detail of these posters.

I am sure, the exhibit chairman will be glad to discuss them with you and to answ-er your questions: about, thorn Miss Fedde: I want to introduce to you one of the girls of the home economics department, who I think has a message that will interest you. Miss Madsen. Miss Madsen: Xi Chapter of Phi Upsilon Omicron is sponsoring the sale of Berea homecraft textiles, arid we wish to invite you to visit the display which is shown on the second floor of Home Economics Building. The pro - ceeds from this sale do not accrue to us, but are sent cirect to the school. We get no profit from this sale. It is one of th&lt; projects in our professional program this year. j Miss Fedde: Now T want to introduce to you a woman, who I an sure needs no introduction to many of you for she will be remembered 1 as a former teacher lon this campus. Miss Gladys Winegar is now on the staff of the Textiles Education Bureau of New York City, and is today to talk to us 01. the subject, "Rejuvenating the House With Smart Fabrics." Miss Winegar: "In these days very few of us have as much money to spend on beautifying our homes as we would like to have, and so we are in- </seg>
         <seg id="p364">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture terested in anything that is attractive and yet not expensive. We are all very susceptible to slogans, and one big store in the east has made itself popular with its women customers, as well as helped itself financially, with the catchy slogan, "It's smart to be thrifty." And it is smart to be thrifty. If you are willing to think, plan and work it out, you may have a most attractive home at very little cost. The consumer wants to know what is available. She also wants to know how to identify merchandise. The Textile Education Bureau exists not only to tell all consumers who are interested just what is available, but all about the things which are available. "Essential things to make a home more attractive, livable and comfortable for every member of the family include also the times when we have guests. We must think of all occasions since we live in a social world." Displaying a ticking for a pillow. Miss Winegar said: "Here is a finished ticking that can be taken off and laundered. It is sanforized and fast color. It has a zipper to permit its being simply removed when soiled, just like a pillow slip. You know today women are in - terested not only in lovely fabrics but also in the health side of mer - chandise. Hygiene is more important today than ever before. The intelligent homemaker today is vitally concerned with the health of her family as well as being: interested in facts which help her spend wisely. I said this fabric is sanforized. Sanforizing is a controlled process of shrinkage. It completely and accurately shrinks cotton and linen fabrics to within a tolerance of 1-1 inch per yard. Each fabric is tested to determine the exact amount of shrinkage when laundered by a standard method, then checked after Sanforizing to be sure it is completely shrunk. Each season there are many new Sanforized fabrics in the stores everywhere from sheer voiles to heavy denim, and here we have a ticking that can be washed without the risk of its not fitting the pillow after laundering. Covers for mattresses can also be had with zippers at the end. They come in standard mattress sizes, or can be made to order of this washable ticking." Other fabrics displayed included: Crashes, firm, strong and wide, suitable for chair and couch covers. As durable as ticking. Snugtight, which can be made to fit any chair, because it is Sanforized and completely finished. Nautical fabric, so-called because of the nautical patterns used. Suitable for beach clothing, draperies, pillows. Narrow stripe, twill construction, which gives a silky, glossy effect. Sateens, mercerized, soft finish without gloss. </seg>

Prints suitable for drapery and other household uses as well as clothing. Linens, natural, in colors and.in prints. Miss Winegar:' .;¦'¦¦' : "Let me call to your attention the labels on these fabrics. You will be delighted to know that this spring you will find a new "All-Guard" label ("guaranteed washable") attached to fabrics and garments. This means that these fabrics have been checked for quality, will stand up and will launder satisfactorily both as to color and&gt; shrinkage. "All- Guard's" children got "Sanforized-shrunk." "Then too there are washable trimmings. How many of us have felt the disappointment of a ruined article after laundering because the trimming shrunk and not the other fabric?. Here we have an assortment of trimmings, all of which have been tested for color and shrinkage, and many manufacturers of trimmings are striving to bring their products up to the standards of Sanforizing so that it will be possible in the future to buy our trimmings that are guaranteed to wash." ''- : Miss Winegar also showed small room planning examples to il - lustrate the different effects that can be. obtained from a variety of fabrics. TO close her talk Miss Winegar took us through a carpet factory pictorially, pointing out the fundamental steps in the making of all textiles, including: .-'¦• - Variety of sources of material Types of raw material Steps in making yarns Laboratories Machines . - Creation of design -Weaving Drum printing . Finishing; . Miss Fedde: In planning the program for this week we have tried to keep in mind the things that will help you. The Extension staff and the Uni - versity staff are always glad to help you for you are the people back home who are doing the job.

         <seg id="p367">Nebraska Home Economics Association This afternoon we are going to have a style show to demonstrate the use of washables in apparel. I never have any difficulty in getting people to wear my garments but I do have trouble getting them off of them! Trends in fabrics are changing, but why? Well, first we have come to our senses completely, and every person whom you meet will inquire before purchasing, "Is this material the type of thing which will be appropriate? Is it the thing that will fit into my -wardrobe? Will it do something for me? Will it add to my own appearance?" We are thinking in terms of the manufacturer who has also you to think about." A style review was presented by Miss Winegar. Garments were modeled by small children ranging in ages from two to twelve years, men and women college students and adult homemakers. New spring fashions were shown in construction ideas and textile fabrics. The style show was one of the highlights of the week's program. Miss Winegar described the method by which the designs for the "Play-a-Tune" fabrics are made, giving the theme-song life in print. The audience sang "Annie Laurie" to conclude this portion of the - fashion review, following which Miss Winegar introduced Miss Allegra. Wilkens. '•¦¦¦ PRESENTATION OF 4-H CHAMPIONS Miss Wilkens: ¦¦;¦¦'' I am sure as We watched this splended showing which Miss Winegar has just given us, displaying all the fascinating fabrics, modeled by girls both little and big, and yonng men as well, we are all wondering how we can make two dresses grow where one grew before And I have the answer—Join a 4-H Clothing Club. These (girls make their - own dresses; and to prove to you the worth of such an undertaking I want to introduce to you Miss Rosabella Muntz, the 4-H Club girl from Nebraska who won a National Championship in the style show last week at Chicago. Rosabelle has carried home-the work of the - -4-H sewing club and is real evidence of what I have just suggested. She was a Summer Clothes project girl. She was the state champion, which permitted her to enter the national 4-H contest where she won national honors. I want to point out a distinguishing feature in Rosabelle's outfit. Many folks seem to think that it costs too much to be in Clothing Club work, Miss Winegar comes from New York with its large stores and her splendid resources from! which to select, but here we have a young lady who bought in her own home town the material which she </seg>

         <seg id="p369">Nebraska Home Economics Association Mrs. Hartz: Will you girls please remain on the platform for a moment. Mr. L. I. Frisbie, state leader of 4-H Club work, I think these people would like to hear from you too, Mr. Frisbie: I think I have a surprise for these girls. They are not quite like the girl that came here from Butler County. She took part in a contest at the end of which she was awarded a ribbon and a gold watch. These girls went through a contest which took the major part of Monday. The awards were not known until the end of the day in fact until two o'clock the next morning, so they have not been presented with their ribbons. I would like to take this occasion to present to these girls their ribbons, blue ribbons for their winning. I know you are interested in knowing something about the other contestants. We had 7 judging teams, each one of which placed com - paratively high. Nebraska was the only state, other than Oklahoma, that entered every contest and every exhibit to which we were eligible, and every one of them won ribbons—four white, three red and two blue. In the judging contests, we had the highest average of any state in the union. We feel that these girls from Hamilton County de - serve special recognition for their accomplishment and I am very happy to present to each of them a 17-jewel Elgin watch in appreciation of their work and the honor they have brought to Nebraska. We have made a real record for Nebraska this year, but with the assistance of all here and a lot more, we are expecting to keep up that record! Mrs. Hartz: Our next speaker comes to us with a very interesting message. Her subject is "World Affairs". Mrs. David Simms of Hastings was in Geneva, Switzerland last summer studying international relations and I am sure she has many interesting things to tell us. Mrs. Simms. WORLD AFFAIRS Mrs. Simms: It is very hard to follow these 4-H folks. Aren't they lovely and aren't we proud of them? I feel I ought to explain my dress, but it is very ordinary, without even a pleat or a tuck to talk about. International relations seem to some people to be so complicated, but international relations are only the relations between people, the relationship between you and myself; between Lincoln and Omaha; be - tween farms and cities; between the United States and Italy; the United States and Germany, and on around the world. </seg>
         <seg id="p370">RfcPORT of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The picture of the world is changing constantly and changing so rapidly that at times it is very hard to fit the pieces together. History tells us that if we will look back we can see the world in a clearer light and so we are going to look back at the past years to see what has happened and to see if we can understand better what is happening. The past year has been an anxious one. The world seems to be sitting on top of a volcano where if we said a word or took a breath something would explode. ' The most upsetting things that have happened the past year are four in number, namely: The Spanish War. The Rome-Berlin Pact, which has now become the Rome- Berlin-Tokio Pact; and with the happenings of last week in Brazil on our own side of the water we are holding our breath because we are wondering if it means the Rome-Berlin-Tokio-Rio de Janiero Pact. I hope not, and Brazil says her fascism is not the same, but regardless of what Brazil says Hitler and Mus - solini were very happy and had some very hilarious celebrations over the fact that Brazil has gone fascist. We have known for some time that out of the 21 re - publics of the world all but 4 are fascist but they have not been so bold as to announce that they are joining with other fascists around the world. The British Rearmament Program. The Japanese-Chinese War. Because of the fact that the Japanese-Chinese War is so close to us and may change all the international relations of the whole world 1 want to talk about that first. ' Remember that in looking at the Japanese-Chinese war we are studying international relations as simply the relationship between people. In looking at the Japanese-Chinese situation we must use all the sympathy and understanding we have because they, like ourselves"• - are human beings. ' In looking at this conflict we must look back a long ways, almost to the beginning of the hardening of the earth's surface to see how China ,s made. China has much land. Her people are agriculturalists, they are farmers and like to live along the river. Because these rivers are so low and their banks are so low there is a constant fear these rivers will overflow, and people tremble and are afraid. All the Chinese live in fear they will be flooded out. But China is privileged </seg>
         <seg id="p371">Nebraska Home Economics Association I i ' to move out beyond the water's reach. Families may go off alone where there is more room for them. The Chinese are a self-contained people. They have a great loyalty to their family. Their main loyalty is family loyalty. They have built on a basis of philosophy which we call 'face saving* and: Americans may study this philosophy and learn much, particularly in the) little relationships within the family. This philosophy carries on inside of the family and it means \ that they do not quarrel, they do not tear down, brag, embarrass and slap, back—but they.save each other's faces. They are kind, (courteous, they build up, they serve each other, never embarrass each other, they bring but the very best they can in their families and in themselves. Face - saving—and because of this face-saving philosophy in the family in the beginning, they have no codes,'no public policy, no policemen. \They didn't'need them. All of those questions were taken care of inside of the .family. .: Then the rest of the world, United States included, saw something in China they wanted; The thing we saw was business, and the rest of ¦.'.' the world went into China to get whatever they wanted. We took with use another kind of philosophy, another kind of loyalty; a loyalty the Chinese did not and could not understand. We took into China na - tional loyalty. Not knowing wiat to do with us or how to treat us and cope with us, they said: "Let us give you extra territory in which to work, and then you let us mind our own business.!' Extra territory was given to.the other countries and we all settled .down. I am not so sure we minded our own business, but today we are reading much in our papers about this extra territory that belongs to each of the other nations. China is probably the 'most peace-loving country in all the world. Confucius taught them "all men are brothers" and the Chinese be - lieve that and have tried to live that way.. In 1912, China changed from an empire to a republic and we ! have said that the country has been in chaos ever since. But what has I looked to us so much like cha,os has only been the natural growth and development of a great country changing from an empire into a re - ' public. Any great change apparently causes chaos. You and I in growing up are children. In changing from babyhood to ( adults we ! go through a dreadful state of development, and oh how we need sympathy and understanding. And so in China, we see a great nation, | '.. an old nation/changing from—maybe we can call it from babyhood to | 7 adulthood—-changing from an empire into a republic, and it is only now since Japan has walked in and brought !war that China is begin - ning to realize what national loyalty means. The Chinamen are only now uniting and coming together as a nation. This is very brief and we have left out the most important parts of Chinese history} but it • gives a quick view of the general picture of today. 1 </seg>
         <seg id="p372">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Japan on the other hand is a very mountainous country, with rivers rushing in torrents down the mountain sides, extremely beautiful; every place you look, you see beauty. But the Japanese have had to live shoulder to shoulder on a very small space of ground. They have their laws, they had to have law and they live by the law. Only 16% of the soil of Japan is fertile and tillable. Only 16% of the soil can be used to raise any kind of a crop. Japan we call an imitator because Japan has gone out into all parts of the worjd and gotten everything she could use. She has taken every opportunity to develop her people. Every Jap has taken unto himself everything he could of his neighbors in order to make of him - self a better Jap, They have a national loyalty. Their national loyalty is probably the greatest national loyalty in the world today. Just the opposite from the Chinese. Every shop girl, wife, coolie and farmer does his best, the very best that it is possible for him to do in order that it may be of more credit to his emperor. Because the land is so poor the farmer has lost more and more as the generations have gone by until we find the farmers themselves have no land. Eighty per cent of the farmers of Japan are tenant farmers and all of Japan is now owned by eight families. I remember back in 1925 and 1926 when the American women banded together in what they called the Cause and Cure of War, whereby they thought if they could just get together and study together and talk things over and make a band of women around the world; and hang on against war, they the women could do something about this war question. From those early days Japan has sent her women in order that she may study right with us. Each time they have gone back home to start peace movements. Just as the war broke out between China and Japan, great peace movements were going through Japan. It was being published and presented from every hill top. The Japanese were saying, 'We must have peace with China. We must live together in peace. We are neighbors. We are the two countries that make up the yellow race. We need each other and we must live together peace - fully.' But the eight families who own Japan were afraid the people would rebel because they were so veiy wealthy and so a few war lords started the war. I want to ask a question right here that will have to be answered some day by someone, and that someone may be here this afternoon: "When ninety per cent of the people of the world—and I might even say ninety-nine per cent—want peace, why is it that one person- Mussolini, two people—Mussolini and Hitler, eight people—owners of all the land in Japan, and seldom more than ten people can throw the world into war as we are thrown into it? How long will we sleep; when will the people arouse themselves and stand up and say, 'No more war.'" </seg>
         <seg id="p373">Nebraska Home Economics Association ¦¦-¦¦¦¦-:¦¦'.¦.:'¦¦' -":¦!, ¦ -¦,¦ , ¦ All it takes is the influence of public opinion. Just about a year ago Japan and Germany made a treaty. The world has been trying to find out) what was in that treaty but no jone knows exactly what was in it. Japan and Germany say they signed that treaty to do away with communism in Russia. I When Japan started the war in China she started long before she was expecting to and she was not quite as prepared as she wanted to be. But Russia has been taking out her very best generals and other officers and aides and mowing them down, taking them out by the dozens, tens and twenties, and Europe had been thinking quite dif - ferently about Russia. We think Russia has the largest and strongest armies in the world. That is something that is hard to find out about. But when so many men are being! deliberately killed off and those men are the finest in the country, there is something wrong some place, and Russia must be weaker, and her armies must be much, much weaker than we over here seem to realize] And Japan has been thinking along these lines with China because she thought Russia was so weak she could not hit back. Back of China, Japan is afraid of Russia. She says Russia is spreading communism throughout China and communism will spread to Japan, and so she is trying to restore China. Japan and Germany signed this treaty and took the treaty down to Rome.about two weeks ago. Fascism lining up against communism; and in Europe you find practically all of the continent divided in just that way, fascism on one side, communism oh the other side. The war in Japan and China, the rest of the world seems to be trying to let them settle themselves. How will it come out? We do not know. Last night the papers said the Japs were winning more and more and going further and further into China. Many people think the Chinese are leaving and will circle in around behind them. Others think Japan will really take China and have her for her own. The poeple who have lived in Japan and China, who really know, say that it does not make much difference, for if Japan does conquer China the Chinese will absorb the Japs eventually and all will be Chinese, ¦.1 . | In Germany the past year, Hitler pulled out of Austria in order to.gain unity with Mussolini. That was Mussolini's price demand of Berlin, that they leave Austria alone. j The world used to say that all roads lead to Geneva and the League of Nations. But they do not and they can be seen today lead - ing to Hitler, and he has an ambitious program for his country. It is this—more territory, more territory is. all he wants. But how is' he going to get that territory? Many people seem to think that Hitler himself does not know. Germany along the eastern border has been more settled and quiet than it has been for a long time. But along </seg>
         <seg id="p374">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the southern border it is not quiet. In Czechoslovakia there are thou - sands of Germans living and they hear nothing but German propaganda all day long over the radio, read nothing but German newspapers telling of the great advancement and accomplishments of Germany, cramming it all down their throats until they are becoming very rest - less and they want to be a part of Germany. Perhaps we should say become a part of Hitler because there is a difference. Germany does look so good on the outside. As you go through the country we see that Hitler has done much. We should not kid ourselves and say fascism is all bad. It is not; it has its good side; but then there is, the other side that is rotten. Instead of saying "Germany" we should say Hitler. Czechoslovakia knows that if Hitler moves in he can take all of the north where the Germans live, and then move down and take the rest including Hungary and Yugoslavia. That is his program, and then he joined Mussolini who said, 'Leave Austria alone.' If Hitler should move into Czechoslovakia, France has promised to support them, but France is not strong enough and Germany is not afraid. Back of France there is Russia, and we have France, Russia and Czechoslovakia. All Europe is shaking with fear and the German army and the Italian army grow stronger each day under two erratic men. England has started a huge rearmament program that has startled not only her own country but has startled the whole world. England knows that if Hitler moves into Czechoslovakia—and that is the starting place of the next world war—knows that Hitler can take Czechoslovakia and France. Many people think Hitler has got hold of some of the generals of Russian armies and has turned them toward fascism. Things will be in a terrible state because if Russia cannot depend upon her own army it will be just too bad. That is why Stalin is taking his head generals and mowing them down. England will have to take a stand because she does not want a military country next to her. It is hard for us to understand that balance of power in Europe. We as Americans cannot understand it because we are the equivalent of forty-eight nations living side by side in peace. They look at us and marvel that we can do it. It does take much, much sympathy and much understanding for us to have in - ternational relations of the right kind around the world. We see dictatorships are very different from any form of govern - ment we know. They must keep something doing all the time, keep up their prestige, keep the light burning and you cannot anticipate what they will do next. </seg>
         <seg id="p375">i Nebraska Home Economics Association 1 - : :: -':¦¦ ' 7 ;.-'¦'." ¦' .. ¦'¦-¦ ! ¦ i Why did the United States let Japan go into China? The answer is that the United States is determined she will not get into war. Why did England let Mussolini go into Ethiopia and then into Spain?— B - ecause we know now that it was not communism in Spain, but it was Mussolini. England's answer is just the same as ours—En. and does not want to get into another war. You would be surprised at J the thinking of the English people. It is almost impossible to believe. The young men of England are standing right up and saying 'No! We will not fight, come what will, we will not fight!' England cannot even find out her own man power because of this feeling, this thinking in England. Thinking has changed. Youth do not want to fight. Youth know that modern warfare does not give them a chance. Life has much more in thrills for them than war, and it is going to take very drastic measures to get any thinking nation where the people know the truth and people can think for themselves. It is going to be very hard to get a thinking people into another war and we in the United States can think more freely than any other country in the world; and [the world is looking to us for their sources of help, their way out from ..war. And so we look back at a year of emotion and surprises and alarms—and we look forwai-d to what? That is the question. We see fascism and communism spreading farther and farther every day, and each with a dictator, and each trying to do away with the other. We cannot.say they are just.dictatorships and let it go at that. They are powerful;; they are moving whole nations of people and are sincere * about it, their government and dictatorship, and they are motivated by high ideals. Hitler and Mussolini hire the very best thinkers to seek "v out ideals and emotions that will appeal to the youth of their nations. Youth want ideals to live by. They will live and die for,ideals jand they are giving their youth ideals. Hitler has a splendid motto that • is simply sweeping over the youth of the country: "Strength through ! joy." "Strength through joy" is the motto of every child in Germany. .' What does it mean? Joy in whatever job you have; whatever your j' place in life, get joy out of it; do it so well that it bringsjjoy! and joy makes strength and you build yourself up and up.: Strength' through joy, and the finer person you can make of your own self, the more you are doing for Germany, and so you are building up Germany by strength through joy. . '.;-. Mussolini has handed to his people the motto 'Italy Supreme!' Nothing in the world must surpass Italy. When we were in Rome we ! saw three huge maps placed at the head of the most prominent street in the city. They are made of black and white marble. One show. Italy at a certain time back, another as it is today, and a third as it .was during the Roman Empire when Italy owned most all of Europe jand most of Africa. There it stands to thrill every youngster and eyery Italian who sees it. "Italy Supreme!" There is no wonder that he </seg>
         <seg id="p376">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture can command thousands to go out and bring back all that they can find. "Italy Supreme", and we, well, that is what we have to cope with. You see a group of young fascists and communists. They have a sparkle in their eyes and a shine on their faces you seldom sec in this country. What do we have to compete with that? I was try - ing to write a definition of communism and fascism when I was in Geneva last summer, but they did not look right on paper. I went over to the American Committee hoping that they had the latest dic - tionary and I could get the latest definition from there for fascism and communism. I wanted a definition that would be accepted around the world but I could get no dictionary there. However, in the room there were eleven Americans so I asked them if anyone there knew the latest definition for communism and fascism. We had a most heated talking spell. I tried to jot down some of the things they were thinking. I noticed two tall, lean, lanky boys sitting down. They were dressed in shorts, heavy shoes, shirts open at the neck, napsacks over their shoulders, and they had the sweetest smiles you ever saw. What were they doing there? Oh, they came over to monkey around and had heard of the League of Nations and had come to give it a look - over, and then were going on. They were surprised to find the youth of the whole world at the League of Nations right there hunting, seek - ing, groping, talking with each other, trying to find a way for world peace. When they were about ready to leave for home something pulled them back to the League and they came back to talk over with the youth of the rest of the world what could be done about world peace. They said it had never entered their heads before, but here they were earnestly talking about world peace. They said that the thing that had impressed them more than anything else in Europe was the great respect those people have for their home government and for their own laws; the fact that there wasn't a person over there that would go through a red traffic light, because it was against the law. Just before I left Geneva, it was announced that religion was going to have a conference there to talk over world affairs, and I wanted to know what religion had to say about international relations, so I de - cided to stay over a few days. The very first morning we got together I had a surprised feeling when they called the roll, for instead of saying, "Presbyterian, Methodist, Catholic, there were no denominations at all. But there were Buddhists, Mohammedans, Christians, and so on. You had a different feeling when you knew all the religions had come together. Back of each prophet each one was seeking, hunting, worshipping, trying to find some divine power leading back to the same, the one divine power. I listened to four lovely lectures. A Hindu talked on brotherly </seg>
         <seg id="p377">Nebraska Home Economics Association luve, but it slid off me-like water off a duck's back, and I thought, 'I guess I should go on and get ready to go home.' j Then a tall, dark man aTose to introduce Dr. Brown, who is a member of the law department of jour own Princeton University. "I want to tell you why I am here because I represent no re - ligion at all. I am not a religious man. We all know that something has gone wrong with the world. The world seems to be on the wrong track. I have been representing the United States in an international conference, and last week I received a cable to come to Luxemburg. The international lawyers were trying! to help bring the world back. It is not one or two or three, but the whole world. I have been at Luxem - ... i burg with the international lawyers, talking, thinking over problems as we have always done. We talked! about this desperate situation, great' ¦'"'. re-armament programs and taxes.7l said, 'Well, I represent the United States and so I would like to have this and this.' England said, 'You. know I occupy one-fourth of the'world and so I must have this and '-.. this.' And France said, 'I live in the most dangerous spot in the world surrounded by fascism and communism, and I must have this and this.' Notice the I want, I, I, and I want." The second day something came over me and I stood up and said, 'The world has gone wrong. The •whole world is almost in a state |of collapse and yet we sit here and. say, 'I want, I want . . . .' I told the international lawyers that I' was leaving. The world is past law. Law cannot pull us out now.' I am putting the cards on the table and it is up to you." Then another man arose, Sir! George P~~ ——°^ England. "I. jtoo Want to tell you why I am here. | For the very same reasons as Dr. Brown! I have just left a conference of financiers who know that England this next February is to' start on the greatest depression she has ever seen in spite of great rearmament. Germany is broke. Italy is broke. Both are going on bluff, and so the financiers were meeting to bring back prosperity. It's gone past us too! For the first time in my life have: I realized that the world has gone beyond man power. We have been praying and saying, '0 God, gimme, gimme, gimme pros - perity. Bring prosperity to me, gimme prosperity." Now the time has come when we cannot say to God any longer, 'Gimme.' We must get down on our knees and say 'You have given me everything,—wheat, coal and all the luxuries and necessities, everything in this world; a brain to work it out, transportation, communication, food, clothes, shel - ter. O.God, you have given me everything, now it is my turn to say, ; "Let me give, and give, and give.' .: ! &#132;I never will forget Sir George P-—:—.Someone rose and asked "What can we do about it? We stand here and hear you tell us these things and know it is true. We go home and tell our people and they :.''"-. say' Bosh! Calamity'!" - : •'.;.; "¦""¦¦; j </seg>
         <seg id="p378">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture I had a personal conference with Sir George P later. I told him I wanted to take his word back to my people, and he told me, 'Here are some of the things you can tell: It is simply a matter of cooperation, GIVING. The more we give to the world the more we receive ourselves. Forget hates, revenge, prejudices, outdoing the other fellow, trying to show off, trying so hard to get something for ourselves, never once thinking of anybody else. We must give, cooperate around the world. We must stretch our minds from the farm into the city, to the state, to the nation. United States isolated? We have got to stretch our minds around the world. Cooperate. That will smash fascism and communism and give a sparkle to the eyes of our youth!"

I feel that you and I are working for the same thing-the welfare of our homes and particularly for our children and our youth. I am interested in these children and youth always from the standpoint of tuberculosis. Much tuberculosis can be prevented by healthful living, healthful sur - roundings, good nutrition and rest. Forty per cent of the population carry the germ of tuberculosis but because we keep ourselves in good condition and keep our children in good condition, we never develop the active disease.

Perhaps we may find the answer, also inspiration, in the little verse entitled "The Gardener": There's a joy in the heart of the gardner As he plucks from its stem, the rose; For it's his in nature's fulfillment To be blest through the flowers he grows. Just a speck called a seed he had planted; A shoot, then a stem break the clod, And the wonderful bush filled with roses Is the gardners version of God. In the garden of Life, we're the roses; Some are shoots, some are buds, some full-bloom; And the Gardner clips where He chooses, For from seed to full bloom we're His own.

We cannot be too grateful to them for they have given their time and energy without monetary compensation. I'll not say they do not have a com - pensation, for they enjoy one of the finest satisfactions of living - that of serving others. This year, there are sixty-one new county chairmen. This is the greatest number we have ever had in any one year because two years ago a number of new counties started project clubs. The first county chairmen in those counties have served their two years and the new - chairmen are now taking the responsibilities of leadership this year. I want to introduce to you one of the first women to receive the leadership pin back in HttS-Mta. Emily Cuba of Colfax County, who will tell us of The Opportunities of Service in Home Demonstration Work. Miss Cuba: Miss Cuba: New County Chairmen. It gives me real pleasure to greet you and to speak to you of the opportunities for service in home demon - stration activities. When I was at the head of the Women's Work in my county this work was ,n its infancy, as Miss Brown has said. Nothing like it had been done before. It was new to the public. Some looked at it with disfavor, until the opposing factions forced the issue by circulating a petition to put it to the vote of the taxpayers as to whether the County Agent's office was wanted or not. However the Farm Bureau Board laid the foundation well and in a short time we had over three - fourths of the farmers signed in favor of the Extension Service and the retention of the County Agent's services. So the opposition dropped the matter and the work has been growing since. Today in counties where this work is new, you have the moral support of the counties where this work is accepted. Your problems may be more of a financial nature, but the knowledge you gain from the project lessons, such as how and where to save and by wise plan - ning of the necessary expenditures alone will more than off-set the small increase in taxes. "Big oaks from little acorns grow", and how well the women's work w,ll grow ¦„ your respective counties depends very much upon you and upon how well you cultivate the Extension Service idea. i ui7l° U Wh° a''f, fr°m CoUnties where the Extension Service is es - tablished your problems are more of how to manage larger group,, how to brmg out the hidden talents of the shy, timid women Yo, will grow along with them. </seg>

Miss Brown: A representative of the 1929 group who received leadership pins will now tell us of Personal Growth in Community Work. I am happy to introduce to you Mrs. Howard Capwell of Elmwood.

One of the fruits of tasks well done, is the personal development which one unconsciously gains. i To find time for your work as chairmari, you have found it neces - sary to plan your home work more efficiently; your families hay learned greater cooperation; you have studied and given much of your time; but you have gained new friends, visited distant communities' and created many new interests. You have gained self confidence and a justifiable pride in your work. Some are never successful leaders because their desire is for per - sonal gain only—not for unselfish service. I 77 •"'" '.-'".. ¦'¦¦¦ '¦'-¦"¦' ' ¦ 7 I Personal development comes when we are willing to learn anything! good, which others can teach us. It thrives on unselfishness, friendli - ness and love. One must have an eagerness and zest for work, know the value of concentration, be able to overcome difficulties and have the ability to "hang on". In overcoming difficulties, we remember that "obstacles" are not things to stop one, but things to climb over. If you can't get clear over, go as far as you can, then crow. j Worth while service gives one a joy and satisfaction in life, but I each individual must find it in her own way. 1 </seg>
         <seg id="p386">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Ida Reed Smith said, "The high sou) climbs the high way, The low soul gropes the low And in between on the misty flats The rest drift to and fro And every man decideth The way his soul shall go." The county chairmen group of 1929 wish for each one of you a heart filled with happines in your task and personal growth as great as you will allow yourself to grow. If you give to the world the best you have, the best will come back to you." Miss Brown: Leadership Satisfactions will be presented by Mrs. A. E. Dixon of . Washington County, who represents the group of 1930. Mrs. Dixon. Mrs. Dixon: There were twenty-one county chairmen who received leadership . pins at Organized Agriculture in 1930 for whom lam requested to . talk briefly on the topic, Leadership Satisfactions. What do we mean f by satisfactions ? The meaning is gratification of a desire, or repose . of mind resulting from such gratification, contentment because of the : _ fulfillment of a desire, recompense, pleasure. There are many leader - ship satisfactions. ¦'¦'.¦ The gratification of the desire for friendships has come with our i! 7 leadership. Friendships among our neighbors in our communities, and ".j among the leaders meeting from all over the county are satisfactions fi for life. The opportunity to come in contact with the charming per- ¦¦ .! sonalities of the fine type of women sent as specialists from Extension I Service has meant much to the women in every corner of the state. ! f Then the friends of mothers' vacation camps are pleasant recol- " ' H lections. It was at Camp Brewster that many of us first became j acquainted with Mrs. S. P. Davis, who was also president of this section I of Organized Agriculture when we, of 1930, were given our pins. Mrs. j John H. Cooper of Douglas county also was a chairman in 1930 and j afterward was honored as a Master Homemaker. How we cherish the memory of these splendid women and strive to follow their example' ' The conventions and councils further this ever spreading bond among 1 farm women. ¦ i Another leadership satisfaction is the growth and development in . ourselves and those about us. "Mrs Mildred Inskeep Morgan told us here at Organized Agriculture in 1936 that it is human to have the feeling wanting to be wanted, to . j </seg>
         <seg id="p387">Nebraska Home Economics Association be needed, to be important. If we have not grown as people in dur own right, and this is especially true of wives, we have to get) our sense of importance from someone else—our husbands and our children. That is why we hold on to our children. I think we need to specialize on something outside of our house and our children. These are 1 the things that will make you grow. Take up something which youl ire not sure you can do, but that you want like everything to do. Your husband and your children will be proud of you if you grow." There has been much satisfaction in noting the personal growth of many of the project women on the farms. I've had personal satis - faction in attending these Organized Agriculture meetings, because . each of the years that I have come there has been one of our four children attending school on this campus. When we begin growing, our activities are directed to broader.fields. Our leadership fits us for work in our Sunday schools, churches, farm bureau organizations and others. . ' That brings us to the greatest satisfaction of all—that of service. To know that we have the ability to serve, that we feel a joy in giving I of our time and energy, brings us happiness and compensation. fTis i Christ-like to serve. I ':'¦.'¦ ¦ ;- .'--.¦':¦'.¦¦¦'.''¦¦ ! The dignity of the recognition by the state leaders at Organized Agriculture means a great deal to every county chairman. To the new county chairmen, I extend the wish that your leader - ship may bring you many satisfactions. 7 "Give to the world the best you have And the best will come back to you". Miss Brown: | In the 1932 group we have a representative from Cass County who will speak on The Satisfaction You Will Enjoy in Being a County Leader. I present to you Mrs. G. R.

Miss Fedde: ' The early part, of this afternoon you saw a sample of the college men and women who are studying agriculture and home economics 1 in this university, and I think I can say to you that this sample represents the rest of the college very well; and I can also say that they are! as fine a group of boys and girls as you will find anywhere. I am not biased, but I think we can come to better decisions by making com - parisons. As I visit other colleges I can compare and I think these students have as fine standards and ideals as you will find anywhere and they are as fine a group as you will find anywhere. i Why do these students come and why aTe they here? In the last three years our enrollment has almost doubled in spite of drouth and depression. I think the answer is, you people! The new county chair - men and the old county chairmen. You are responsible for bringing to this college these fine young people. They are your neighbor's. .'..'. Ninetyrfive per cent of them represent Nebraska. On behalf of these young people I want to express to the county chairmen an appreciation for the oportunities they are having here, for the inspiration, encour - agement, and help you have given them to further their education! in the two most worthwhile fields—agriculture and home living. I think this education will mike for better agriculture and better home living, and all-Nebraska is to be benefited by what you have done and are doing for your state. In addition these young people are also getting I training for a vocation so that we will have better high school teachers and extension workers and dietitians; and last but not least, fine home - i makers; and so we thank you. - I -'..'¦ ;'-""•¦ .-'¦--¦ I Miss Brown: ' 1 j, ¦ •'.: Our next speaker is one who is interested in all of the rural.ac - ! tivities in the State, and who realizes all of the things that can Ibe -, accomplished through leadership.

An Appreciation of Leadership Your friends and neighbors have chosen you county chairmen of home demonstration project work.

By this choice there devolves upon you that duty of inspiring your fellow workers with a loyalty to service and a desire for achievement 'of those things in home making and home life that are necessary for better ': agriculture and more complete living on Nebraska farms. | Your selection was an honor and privilege, but it also implied duties </seg>

While the work you have done and the goals achieved are highly commendable you have but entered into this field of leadersh.p so essential to Agriculture's welfare and to National progress. Others : may assume in the coming years your tasks of the present, but leader - ship accomplishments imply growth of the individual and point the way to broader fields.

Miss Wilkens: It is my happy privilege to come before you again. I told you yes - terday about the exhibits we have but I knew you would not be satis - fied and so I brought you our style show girl and judging team. But that is not all. 4-H has a lot of splendid things for girls to do. This morning I am introducing to you two more girls. These girls have come from their school to visit with us. Last fall they worked to a high pitch for State Fair to present a demonstration and it is not - easy to work it up again, but I wanted you to see some of the ma - chinery of a 4-H demonstration. There has to be something back of a fine demonstration and so I want to present to you Miss Christine Carlson, who has directed 4-H girls work so efficiently in Lancaster County (Miss Carlson stood). It is fine to have one champion in a family, but what of two champions in the same family? These girls are sisters, and their ' name is Foster, Betty, fourteen, and Jean, sixteen. I want you to know '&lt; their mother and so Mrs. Foster, will you please stand and let these \ people see the mother of these two champion 4-H girls (Mrs. Foster ' j stood). I think you should also know their leader, Mrs. W. Lyness j Will you please stand, Mrs. Lyness? I Mrs. Lyness: I I alone should not take the credit for the girls' work.

         <seg id="p395">Nebbaska Home Economics Association The name of our demonstration is "Choosing Accessories for the High School Girl." We will discuss the following topics: What ac - cessories are, why we wear them and the points we consider in choos - ing accessories. Then we will demonstrate how these points can be carried out on our own costumes. Accessories aid and contribute to some result or effect, but are not the most important item. In our case we desire a complete harmonious costume. Accessories are the -little things that make this costume complete. .' As I name some accessories, Betty will show you some that we think are appropriate for the high school girl. Shoes that are sensible and serviceable as well as good looking are the type Worn by the school girl. We have chosen some With low heels because we have learned that they are better for our feet and help us to have better posture. Hose of four thread or more are the most serviceable for the school P*l' ;7"'; ¦ " Anklets are comfortable as well as attractive. Handkerchiefs of a color that are in harmony with the rest of the costume are nice while the white ones are always appropriate. Shoes,, stockings and handkerchiefs' are necessities as well as ac - cessories. '¦!.'•'• .-:'¦¦&gt; Purses are practical for many occasions. • Hats for the school girl are not extreme in style. Neckwear such as collars and scarfs change the effect of the dress. Belts are best if there is not too great a contrast in color and ma - terial between the belt and the dress, j Gloves are nice, especially those that are washable for summer or some that can be easily cleaned for fall. .'¦'... How much better it is that the jewelry of the school girl is very! simple in this day and age. Flowers of the conventional type add color to the costume. Hair ribbons are practical and attractive for the school girl. Betty will continue by telling "Why We Wear Accessories." ! Betty speaking: There are several reasons for wearing accessories. First, they </seg>
         <seg id="p396">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture give variety to the costume. Jean could change this costume by chang - ing the brown scarf to the rose neckerchief and also the brown belt to the rose and white belt. This contributes a contrast-in color and line which is our second point. The rose colored belt changed the vertical lines to horizontal. This would be poor for a short stalky girl because it would make her look even shorter. Since Jean is rather tall this is all right. The third point is that they emphasize our good points and features. This rose scarf brings out the rose in Jean's complexion. It also brings out the blue ,n her eyes by way of contrast. The draped or soft lines emphasize the oval of Jean's face. _ .T,_ f°Urth Bnd i3St im P°rtant reas°n for wearing accessories is hat they express our individual taste or personality. For instance the dainty type person would wear this dainty collar, while the athletic type would wear this more severe or tailored collar. Jean will continue by telling the points we consider ,n choosing accessories. «•«¦¦_, Jean speaking: We have listed seven important points to consider in choosing accessories. The first is Attractiveness. Unless our accessories make our cos - tume more attractive, there would be no reason for wearing them. Simplicity in accessories is in vogue in this day of many prints. The activities of the school girl make fancy "do dads" seem im - practica We feel the accessories of the school girl should be I__ elegant than those worn by young women of college age or older women. Quality in color, material and design is essential. By design we mean the shape or cut of the accessory. For instance, this simple bracelet has better design than this fancier one. It is better because it is simpler and is not an imitation of a more valuable material. Also, the simpler one will not tarnish. It is best to choose accessories that are suitable to the person costume and occasion. Person, n_ H .Vn. _* _ T fo^™ 8 that ate m Pr°P°r«°n to the size and needs of the individual. A large person can carry a larger purse than a smaller person Since a bright shiny purse is more noticeable than a dull one the dull purse can be larger in proportion. We would not not IV _ f ?_"" y r6d PUrSS f°r th 6 School ** be&lt;*^ we do not think she should attract so much attention to her accessories. In - stead, we would choose a purse of this type. </seg>
         <seg id="p397">Nebraska Home Economics Association It is best to have relationship in color, material and design be - tween the accessories themselves and the accessories and the rest of . the costume. The amount spent for accessories varies with the financial standing of the family. Usually the girl cannot spend much so chooses acces - sories than can be easily cleaned and can be worn wth different cos - tumes such as we have shown you. Betty will now demonstrate these points on my costume. Betty speaking:' She can change this costume even more by changing the rose belt and rose neckerchief to the printed belt which ties in a bow in the front. If you tie the lower,tie first the bow will lay straight. She &#132; •'¦ also can put on a collar of the same print. This collar is in two pieces and put on with snaps. This makes it easy to take off and launder. There is relation between the collar and the belt and the dress be - cause they are both of cotton shantung. The collar also ties in front. There is relation between the bows.! These accessories are fine quality material, inexpensive and practical. This outfit is suitable for the school girl because of her activities. By adding this jacket we have a more dressy outfit which is good for street wear. With the jacket this dress is a good example of the Greek law of proportion 2to 3. It is 2 part printed in the jacket and 3 part plain in the skirt. She is wearing white low heeled oxfords that are suitable for school or street wear. - Her anklets are in harmony with her costume. Her hat is simple and appropriate for school or street wear. The gloves, purse and hand - kerchief complete her outfit. Jean will'continue by explaining points in my costume. Jean, speaking: A person with poor taste might have these flowers on hand and thinking they make the afternoon dress more attractive, wear them. And to carry out the color scheme wear this wide shiny belt. She might have been down town the day before and. bought these striped socks. Then to make the costume dressier, she might wear these high heeled slippers. But, since we have taken 4-H work we have learned that these flowers are too large for the school girl to wear, so we would not wear them. Instead she is wearing an inconspicuous green clip which harmonizes nicely with the peach in her dress. The buttons and buckle are of the same color as the dress so she can change her acces - sories very easily. This wide, bright belt cuts the vertical lines of her body and makes her look shorter, which she does not need so we would not wear it. Her belt of the same. material as the dress is better. </seg>
         <seg id="p398">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Instead of these sport anklets she is wearing silk hose which har- ¦ ' momze with the costume. These high heeled slippers have no support | m the arch and have a very high heel so we have chosen some low '- heeled sandals which have support in the arch because of the middle strap. These are suitable for afternoon wear. To complete her cos - tume she must have a purse, gloves and handkerchief. She would also need a hat so we have chosen this off-the-face felt. Isn't this a much more pleasing afternoon outfit than the girl with poor taste might choose? Betty will conclude the demonstration. Betty speaking: We have listed the common accessories and told you why we wear them. We have explained to you the points we consider in choosing accessories which are: 1. Attractiveness 2. Simplicity 3. Quality 4. Suitability 5. Proportion fi. Relationship 7. Cost We hope you will remember when you choose accessories that "It is the little things that count" and accessories give the finishing touches which either ruin an outfit or make it smart. Are there any questions? If there are no more questions, this will conclude our demonstration. Thank you. Miss Brown: In our project work, this year we have been emphasizing reading. Next year we hope that we may have something else to include in our work such as health. How many of you think the subject of health would be a good one to have? Life is not worth so much if we do not have health and I think we need a real program for it. One of the most important phases of health is that of the dental health and we have invited Dr. J. R. Thompson to talk to us and show us some of 7J77 SnT77. k7 th- DT- Th°mpSOn is Director of the State Dental Health Educat.on Program in Nebraska. He comes to us from the State Department of Health. Dr. Thompson. How Teeth Grow Dr. J. R. Thompson: Public health dentistry is today no longer a meaningless phrase. I: </seg>
         <seg id="p399">Nebraska Home Economics Association It is a vital living part of a nation's public health service. It is just as important as vaccination, immunization, quarantine and other med - ical procedures. It is obvious that interest in public health is growing rapidly. It is also obvious that the public will show a real interest in public health dentistry if the far-reaching affect of dental disease is drama - tized in the same way other diseases are dramatized. If that story is not written, dramatized, and presented to the public and dental dis - ease fails to receive the attention it deserves, the blame can be placed .squarely in the Jap of our own profession. Where will public health dentistry lead us? What may it hope to accomplish? The answers may be.found in the accomplishment of the medical profession, pioneer, in public health activities. The last statistical report of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Com - pany carried this item: "The combined death rate from measles, scar - let fever, whooping cough,' and; diphtheria, the four principal com - municable diseases, has reached a new minimum. "Twenty-five years ago the death rate from this group was 144.6 per 100,000 population in contrast to 27.7 per 100,000 in 1935, a de - cline of 81%. Instead of accounting for twenty-five out of every one hundred deaths twenty-five years ago they account for only twelve out of every one hundred today. "In the last twenty-five years each of these diseases in this group has shown a decided downward trend, the sharpest decline is that of diphtheria. This sharp decline bears witness to the extraordinary ef - fectiveness in the prophylactic and therapeutic measures applied on a large scale." Although no specific weapon has been available for the other dis - eases in the group, measles, scarlet.fever and whooping cough have at the same time recorded a large decline. No doubt the decline in these three diseases is due to the rising standard of living and the spread of hygienic knowledge. !. Medical programs should inspire dentistry. A like program is certainly in order for the dental profession. Just as medical organiza - tions today devote themselves to the control of cancer, syphilis, heart disease, tuberculosis, diphtheria, small pox, etc., so must dentistry de - velop ah organization devoted to the study of dental disease whose duty it shall be to inform the public of the relationship of teeth to health and how dental disease can be prevented and controlled. I am glad to say that both physicians and dentists are awakening to their responsibilities and opportunities in this field which we must </seg>
         <seg id="p400">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture admit has been too long delayed. Dentistry is being recognized today as a mighty force in the public health battle against mankind's most dreaded enemy—disease. Public health medicine is preventive medi - cine and public health dentistry likewise is preventive dentistry. A dental survey was conducted in 1934 by the American Dental As - sociation in cooperation with the United States Public Health Service and in that study 1,600,000 grade school children in 26 states were ex - amined. They asked for 10% or more in each of the states, about equal number of boys and girls, an equal number from rural and urban areas, and an equal number from homes where economic conditions were above normal and from homes where the economic conditions were below normal. A standard examination blank was used and the examinations were made by dentists in the school rooms, each using a mouth mirror and an explorer. Because of the bad lighting conditions in many of the schools and because the examinations were all made in a wet field with only a mouth minor and an explorer, no doubt a great many small cavi - ties were overlooked. In Nebraska 11.4% of the total number of grade school children were examined. The study was carried on in 44 counties and when the figures were all tabulated by the Treasury Department we discovered that 90.4% of our children in Nebraska were in need of dental treatment. Other states recorded from 85 to 95%. When you realize the very close relationship between teeth and health you can readily understand that a condition where 90% of our children are affected, presents to us all a real health problem because teeth do not decay in the mouth of a perfectly healthy individual. We cannot prevent dental decay by vaccination or by the injection of a serum under the skin. It is not as simple as that. Nevertheless it is, in the great majority of children, a preventable disease and it has been demonstrated many times in large groups of children that it not only can be prevented, but it can be stopped after it has developed. Human beings are fortunate for we have two complete sets of teeth, 52 in all. The first set of teeth, twenty in number, start making their appearance in the mouth at about six months of age and at the age of thirty months the last of the first set of teeth have erupted. Now while these teeth make their appearance in the mouth during the period when the child is from six to thirty months of age, we must remember the crowns of all of those teeth were formed before the baby was born as the pictures you will see later illustrated. Therefore, the mother is re - sponsible for the quality of those teeth. Many times the upper third of the first permanent tooth (the six year molar) is developed before birth. Here with this expectant mother is our first opportunity to practice preventive dentistry. With a normal healthy mother, proper and ade- </seg>
         <seg id="p401">Nebraska Home Economics Association quate nutrition will, no doubt, have some definite bearing on the quality of that first or deciduous set of teeth of her baby. Not only that, but it will help materially to prevent decay in her own teeth during preg - nancy and it is always advisable that she be under the care of her den - tist as well as her physician-during the months preceding the birth of the child and as long as she contributes to the feeding of that child afterward. Teeth have certain definite functions to perform; first, to chew our food; second, to assist in speech; third, to assist in facial development and expression, and in case of the deciduous teeth they serve as path - finders for the second or permanent set of teeth. As you watch the pictures you can readily see the important part the deciduous or baby teeth play in facial development and expression of the growing child and the necessity for maintaining them in a healthy condition to have normal growth and development in the jaws. There is another important reason for maintaining those baby teeth in a healthy condition, they are the teeth that are going to prepare the food for digestion and assimilation during the time in the child's life when the greatest amount of physical and mental development takes place from 2 _ to 12 or 13 years of age. Many children are handicapped in chewing their food properly be - cause of badly decayed and infected teeth and the habit of bolting food is often developed at that time because it hurts so badly to chew. You can readily understand how a habit of that sort can be formed when badly decayed and infected teeth are allowed to remain through a period of from one to three years. This habit is often carried on into adult life with the many complications that develop later all because that first set of baby teeth had been allowed to decay and then neglected to. the point where extraction became necessary. By observing three simple fundamentals, dental decay can be les - sened and the condition that exists, among our grade school children can be very much improved. Those fundamentals are.proper and ade - quate nutrition, oral hygiene, and regular visits to the dentist for every child from 2% years and up. ' I recognize that it is not possible for all parents in their respective homes to have at all times the proper foods for their children and even though you try you will not be able to prevent decay of the teeth com - pletely, but you will be able to! help a great deal with proper and ade - quate foods. I think too many of us as parents try to feed our children the same foods that we as adults prefer and do not take into consideration that children need twice as much of the teeth and bone building materials as we adults need. Because of the fact that children cannot consume </seg>
         <seg id="p402">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture any more food or possibly not as much food as an adult, it follows that the foods they do consume should be richer in the necessary body de - veloping elements. The foods that we recognize today as the best health foods, not only for the prevention of dental decay, but for body growth and de - velopment as well are first of all milk and the dairy products, meaning cream, cheese, butter, etc., green leafy vegetables, and fruits of all kinds both raw and canned. The second factor that is important in the prevention of decay is mouth hygiene. Children should be taught early the proper use of the tooth brush (explain proper method, explain use of soda and salt). Teeth should be brushed twice each day—before going to school and before going to bed. The third factor that must be considered is the importance of early and regular visits to the dentist. We believe that a child should start going to the dentist at 2V. years of age and every six months there - after or as often as the dentist may require. The reasons for that are very obvious. There are many children three years of age already with badly decayed teeth and when we understand the anatomy or construc - tion of the deciduous or baby teeth we find the pulp or nerve of those teeth occupying a much larger proportion of the tooth than is true of the permanent tooth. A small cavity in a baby tooth may mean a nerve exposure and a nerve exposure means pain and just a little later infection with a gum boil or abscess at the end of the root with the ac - companying inflamation, swelling, and finally draining is established through the gum or at the neck of the tooth. I should like you to remember that the very same blood which flows in and through this infected area is the same blood which flows through the heart, kidneys, etc., and that oftentimes some of the bac - teria from this infected area is left in one or more of the vital organs and many unpleasant results follow. Many times the neglected tooth must be extracted to eliminate the infection. If the child happens to be 4 to 7 years of age and the teeth so infected happen to be one or more of the baby molars, you have the beginning of a condition which means underdevelopment of the jaw and the resultant crowding condition of the permanent teeth when they arrive a few years later. All of this could have been prevented had that child been making regular visits to his dentist for necessary examinations and treatment. It is necessary that cavities in deciduous or baby teeth be found before they become large enough to see by looking in the child's mouth if the teeth are to be repaired with the least amount of trouble and expense. There are many other advantages to be gained with regular visits </seg>
         <seg id="p403">Nebraska Home Economics Association to the dentist. Certain habits such as lip sucking, thumb sucking, lip biting and sleeping postures, etc. all have definite bearing on growth and shape of the jaws and many times the dentist will be able to detect the affect these habits are having and with the cooperation of the par - ents these early habits can be easily broken. I know that parents are willing to do a great many things for their children which were denied them when they were children, even at an enormous sacrifice, when they are once convinced of its value. lam sure that it is wiser that the child and the dentist get acquainted early in the life of the child when there need be no unpleasant relationship, and the child will think of the dentist as his best friend. Compare that relationship with what is a common practice today when the child's first experience in the dental office comes after a night of toothache and the child is nervous be - cause of the soreness of the tooth. Natural fear results and that ex - perience is neither fair to the child nor to the dentist. "Why Not The Child" "You know the model of your car, You know just wbat its powers are.

Indeed, all the traffic in our streets, over the tele - phone and telegraph, and across continents and oceans is set going by people looking for something of value. Last Sunday night I was speaking to a group of young people When question time came their most insistent question was, "How can we know what is most worth while in life?" This is a veVy common question of those modern young people who are thinking. The world themllr S°77 many thingS and S° many opportunities to invest themselves, yet there are very few sources where they can find out male _____ _*' " T haVe « times ™re Voices to make than did their grandparents but not nearly so much guidance in </seg>
         <seg id="p405">Nebraska Home Economics Association making their choices. iSome of these young people are looking for a talisman or formula by which they can get the most out of life. This is not an original way of going about it. Down through the long cen - turies mankind has tried persistently to find the most worth while all tied Up in one bundle. There are many tales of man's search for the Fountain of Youth, for the Holy Grail, for some Utopia, or for a Christmas-tree kind of heaven. But these accounts, however glamorous, have not convinced most of us that the most worthwhile in life is secured by some one lucky find. Even those who have struck gold or oil or diamonds have not seemed to get the most out of life. Nor are the happiest people those who spend their days in counting and taking care of all the things they own. Last spring tragedy walked into my study in the.guise of a beautifully groomed woman who said to me, "I've just waked up to find that my hands are empty." This woman pays '•': an income tax of $15,000.00 per year in her own right. Her husband pays the same amount in his own right. They have an elaborate es - tate. For their family of six they have eleven servants, yet she reports truly that her hands are empty. She had never learned how to choose from life those things that would keep her life rich and full. She had listened to all the voices around her that had held first this thing and then that thing up as the thing in all their world. She had listened ' and lost. There are many voices all about every one of us today also telling . us what to do and buy and think and play and eat and drink and study ¦ and read and see and wear. Our boys and girls in high school certainly are keenly aware of them, and they feel that they must do what the voices of the socially important crowd demand or be left out of all the things that make life count for young people. Everywhere, every - where all sorts of values are being presented to us in the most enticing terms, but we are not sure how many words are being said for those selling us the values and how many for our interest. Now it is into this kind of a society that our little children are growing. None of us certainly is sorry that "the world is so full of a number of things," but we would like to learn how to know which j '.':¦¦ of all these things are the ones that will make us and our children "as happy as kings." There is nothing in all.the world that is good or bad in itself, and so we cannot divide things into two piles and take what we have named good and leave what we have called evil. Things are good if they fulfill good purposes, and are bad if they promote _'•.'.!. evil purposes or fail the good. In the olden days of our country, there were authorities who set up the good and decreed that everybody .! should promote what they said was good. Today there are no such authorities, no institutions that select and.set up explicit goods and evils for all of us to serve. This means then that each individual has to choose the good for himself and he has to have some tool of meas- </seg>
         <seg id="p406">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture urement for doing so. He has to have his own table of standards by which he can judge what he wants to choose from all that the world offers him. This table or tool is his system of values. It is made up of all the values he has tasted in his experiences of life. How is it that the child comes to taste values? First of all he tastes some of the values of the world with his own body through his senses. The tiny child thinks that anything that feels good is good and anything that feels bad is bad. There are many people of adult age who judge the good in this same infantile way. And indeed, we should enjoy the "goods" that we appreciate through feeling them providing they do not stand in the way of higher "goods." A generous slice of homemade bread and butter when we are hungry, or a shower and fresh linen when we are tired from a tramp are real "goods " at least most of the time. But if the delicious bread and butter makes us too fat to enjoy walking and gardening and other interesting ac - tivities, then it is a lesser "good" and should not stand in the way of this greater "good." Another way the child discovers value is in noting what older per - sons treat with consideration as of great value—high marks in school no matter how obtained, keeping the fresh tablecloth clean with no regard for manners at the table when the cloth is not fresh, the new davenport and other treasures guarded by adults. Again, the child tastes values and disvalues by observing people all about him, noting what they have or do that looks enticing, and then imitating them. He is often disappointed and disillusioned when he tries out the tastes of values in this way. Education is really the provision of situations where the child may taste values under guidance. Instead of just hit and miss trying out of values, he is put into situations where he experiences new values in connection with values he already knows and cherishes. In this way the child comes to see the value in taking turns, in persistence toward success and other "goods" which otherwise he would miss. The very most effective way for the child to learn new values is for him to live with people who are very enthusiastic about these values themselves and so make appreciative use of them. "If Daddy is crazy about spinach, it must be good." "If mother works so hard to keep the house clean, there must be something in this business of cleanliness." 'If big brother will spend all the money he slaved for all Saturday morning on a football game, it's sure to count for something." But if the family sends a penny to the church each Sunday and a quarter to the movie house each Saturday, the child can well figure it out that the parent thinks that the movie house is the better institution of the two. It is chiefly by our enthusiasms and our indifferences that the child </seg>
         <seg id="p407">Nebraska Home Economics Association senses what we count as valuable. He doesn't listen much to our mere words. _ There are other ways in which the child experiences and learns to appreciate values, but now how do these values that he learns to care for get built into a system of values? A system of values means that there is one value at the highest point in the group which is held to be best of all and prompts first choice of it when it is present, and then the other values are beneath this, some of them near, some far. How do all his values get arranged into this pyramid of values? And how can we help him to put the values that are truly the best at the apex of his system of values? It is a great temptation of parents to think out what they believe are the great values and then try to teach the child through precept or punishments to put their revered values first. But this is not a success - ful method, for the child has not had a real taste of adult values and cannot get a convincing taste of these mature "goods" until he himself is mature. He may imitate the adults or "mind" what they say when he has to do so, but just as soon as he is out from under their eyes, he will begin to try out other values. This often happens with young people who have been forced to live by the values and standards of adults until they go away to college or Work. They are not long away from home before they are up to all manner of socalled "wild" escapades. As a matter of fact, they are only laying off the cloak of their parents and they have no tools for living of their own. If we had to sum up the way the child builds his system of values, we might say that it is through a progression of enthusiasms, of fads, of hobbies, of interests, of loyalties. The Christian Bible words it this way—."from glory unto glory." The child finds something in life that he thinks is the most wonderful thing that there is. Now you and I may think that we know that it is something very trivial, and we may be right. But the way for us to help him learn this, is not to talk about it with him, but rather to encourage him to devote himself to his chosen interest with all his heart and intelligence so that all the sooner he will discover its limitations. One more thing we must do here. That is to see that he has some experience at the same time with other values something like the one he is serving but of both better and worse quality. In this way he has an opportunity to compare a number of values, to see them in perspective and then to discover which are truly better and which truly worse. Then he makes the choice and he gives the better value a higher place in his system of values, not because you or I say so, but because he knows the taste of it. After he once has had a good taste of a value and learned that it is good, it becomes a part of his very self. When he has fresh experiences in life and discovers new values that he learns are even better than those he has adopted, he gives them a higher place, So it goes, choice by choice, he adds value </seg>
         <seg id="p408">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture upon value, always giving the value which is the best at any one time the top place in his system. Again I say that you and I must not be distressed if his top value seems very much lower than what we hold to be of first value. He must be allowed to grow from value unto value, "from glory unto glory." Indeed, in one sense, that is all that character is, choice upon choice We choose one value and then another until you and I are the sum total of all the choices that we have made. This means, then, that parents and teachers must be present in the living environments of the child when he is making his choices. I do not mean that we must be geo-' graphically near him all the time, but I do mean that we shall be near enough his interests and needs and problems so that he will not hesitate to share these with us whenever it will mean anything to him We must help him realize that he is not making a choice for himself unless he knows a good deal about what he is choosing, and then help h.m to explore the values that are enticing him before he makes hi. choice There is a bit of a joker for us in this also, for very often the adult will change his estimate of some value he either exalted or belittled when he comes to study it afresh with the exploring child. This is growth for both. Our value systems must change, too, as we grow. For us as well as the child, it must be "from glory unto glory." If you and I refuse to change our value system,-our beliefs, tastes, ideas ideals, and all that reveals what we hold to be dearest and best in hfe-we may know for a surety that the time will come when the child will disregard our guidance in his testing and building of values Then we shall have lost our comradeship with the child in exploring all the riches of our vast world. When the child leaves our home and goes into the world to try his fortune it will not be determined nearly so much by the amount of chemistry or algebra or even English he has studied as it will be by the quality and the type of his most important tool, his system of values.

It gives me pleasure to introduce to you their director, Mrs. Evelyn Mac Donald Camblin. Mrs. Camblin: We in Lincoln County have the unusual privilege of having among us a woman who has done a great deal of work on flag history. She is Mrs. Esther Antonidis Lannin, who is state chairman for education in the correct use of the American flag under the supervision of the </seg>
         <seg id="p409">Nebraska Home Economics Association Daughters of the American Revolution. The chorus is going to serve as atmosphere for her lecture on the history and use of the American flag. Mrs. Lannin. THE STORY OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES MRS. ESTHER ANTONIDIS LANNIN , The name of this talk is the evolution or development of the. flag of the United States of America. Flags have been used since the dawn of civilization as a means of recognition by nations and individuals. As far back as Biblical times, the Lion of Judah was known as the emblem of that tribe, and the strength and bravery of that tribe was respected wherever the design of the Lion was seen. .'.' Today, nations are recognized on land and sea by their national emblems displayed on public buildings and ships at sea. So we see that flags are as old as man himself. The oldest flag, not. the woven flag itself, but the oldest kind of a flag, in the world that is still the same design that waved thousands of years ago, is the simple flag of Japan, like a great white handkerchief with a red round spot in the center. (Displayed Flag of Japan) ..-. European Flags in North America. (Taken from Kerrick) From the sagas or traditional history of the Danes comes the names of Eric the Red and Lief Ericson. In 1000 A. D. Lief with a band of thirty-five brave, adventurous Norsemen, in their Viking ship, sailed westward from Iceland on a voyage of exploration on into the "Sea of Darkness" so called because of the extremely long nights and short days in that northern latitude. - The mariner's, compass had not been invented. They were guided by the sun and stars or perchance when lost at sea, by a raven liber - ated by them from their ship, and which, after soaring high above, would then fly in the direction of land and in which direction the ship would follow. They sailed on and on westward to the south end of Greenland. They continued to the south and west and finally reached the shores of North America. They remained for the winter at what may have been Narrangansett Bay, Rhode Island. An ancient tower in Rhode Island is credited by some historians to these Danes. The land visited was called Vinland because of the abundance of grapes found growing along the shores. The first European flag or banner of modern times to reach North America was therefore that of the Norsemen or Danes, a black Raven on a white field. The raven was adopted as the emblem of the Danes because it was their hope and guide in times of doubt and perplexity at sea. </seg>
         <seg id="p410">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Flags of Spain in North America For a period of five hundred years after the discovery of Green - land and Vinland by the Danes, there were occasional voyages by Norsemen to this new world and a few minor explorations by Europeans in North and South America, but no permanent colonization. The four voyages of Christopher Columbus to the New World in 1492-1503, and the voyages of John and Sebastian Cabot in 1497-1498, resulted from profound deliberations. Those voyages mark the beginning of the ex - ploration of the Western Hemisphere by European Nations upon the simple plan that "They may take who have the power and they shall keep who can." Although Christopher Columbus was an Italian navigator, born at Genoa, his voyages to the New World were made for King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. When first coming ashore upon the Island of Guanahani of the Bermuda Group, October 12, 1492, accom - panied by his retinue of officers, Columbus was gaily robed in a military suit of scarlet embroidered in gold and personally carried the Royal Banner of Spain. (His crew followed carrying the personal banner of Columbus which had been given to him by Queen Isabella). The Royal Spanish Flag of that period was the quartered flag of Castile and Leon, the two principal provinces of Spain, represented by two castles, yellow on a red field, and two lions, red on a white field. The banner of Columbus bore the green cross of Christianity on a white field with the letters F and I beneath two yellow crowns, repre - senting Ferdinand and Isabella. Ponce de Leon, Balboa, Magellan, Velasquez, DeSoto and Menendez all carried the Royal Spanish Flag and extended the Spanish domain to vast regions of untold natural and mineral resources. These flags of Spain meant a great deal in the history and develop - ment of the United States. The Flags of England and Great Britain in North America A year before Columbus in 1498 on his third voyage to the New World, first reached the continent of the western hemisphere at the mouth of the Orinco River, South America, another Italian navigator and explorer from Genoa, a boyhood friend of Columbus, Giovanni Caboto (John Cabot) sailing westward from England on a voyage of discovery for King Henry VII of England, reached the shores of New England. He declared all undiscovered lands touched by these waters to be possessions of the King of England and thus set up in America the standard or flag of England which at that time was the Cross of St. George. </seg>
         <seg id="p411">Nebraska Home Economics Association Some historians maintain that King Edward I of England when Prince Edward, and while on a crusade to the Holy Lands about 1275 A:D. became interested in the story of St. George and the dragon and. before returning to England visited the) monastery of Cappadocia at Beirut where his interest increased to such a point that soon after returning to England, as King, he adopted the Red Cross of St. George on a white field as the flag of England. Other historians claim that the Cross of St. George was given to, England by a Pope about 1327 A.D. The Cross of St. Andrew of' Scotland The cross of St. Andrew, a white saltire cross on a dark blue field, was the flag or banner of Scotland for a century or more before the Cross of St. George became the banner of England, but its origin is so clouded as to be undeterminable with historic accuracy. It came to America during the early explorations and settlements by the Scots in Nova Scotia coincident! with English, settlements in New England and Virginia. •'.-¦' When James VI of Scotland became King James I of Great Britain in 1603, confusion arose amongst and between the captains of the vessels of the two countries as to which should salute first when meeting or passing on the high seas or in harbors. The controversy was settled in 1606 by a proclamation of the King establishing a new flag for Great Britain consisting of the Cross of St. George superimposed upon the Cross of St. Andrew. It was commonly called the Grand Union Flag or The King's Colors. Joining these two flags is of special in - terest to Americans since it brought together the colors red, white and blue, which colors, differently arranged became the National Colors of the United States two centuries later. This Grand Union Flag was probably flown from the main top - masts of the Constant and the Mayflower and the Cross of St. George from their foremasts when these vessels sailed from England in 1607 and 1620 respectively with the Jamestown and Plymouth Colony Ex - peditions. '-.".. In 1707 Queen Anne by a Royal Proclamation established a new national Flag called the British Red Ensign as the flag of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) being a red field with the Grand Union Flag as a canton. . This Red Ensign became known the world over through display on the high seas as the Flag of Great Britain. It was the flag of Great Britain in America throughout the Revolutionary war. It was replaced at New York by the Stars and Stripes November 25, 1783. </seg>
         <seg id="p412">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The Pine Tree Flag of "Washington's Cruisers" i The Pine Tree Flag was adopted by colonial ships as many ship masters would not sail under the British flag and any ship without an ensign was treated as a pirate. The pine tree finally became the only design on a white field with the words above "An appeal to Heaven." It was used by a temporary fleet of floating batteries on Boston Harbor and six privateers, known as Washington's cruisers. This fleet was created after the King determined to use more stringent measures of subjugation against the rebellious colonies and English subjects in America. The Striped Union Flag 1776-1777 The Grand Union Flag When this flag was raised over the garrison at Cambridge, Mass., with appropriate ceremonies by Washington and the Flag Committee, it was greteed with thirteen cheers and thirteen guns. This flag was displayed by Washington at the head of the colonial army in Cambridge on New Year's day 1776, six months before the Continental Congress in Philadelphia voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence. The British when they saw this new banner understood it to be a signal of submission to the King. But King George soon learned he was mis - taken, that the colonies were not going to plead for their lives. The soldiers from across the sea were highly indignant because they were brought over to fight the "Peasantry." But when the peasantry had routed them with great slaughter, and made the red coats run all the way from Concord and Lexington back to Boston, they began to see the difference between the peasants of Europe and the farmers of America. It was the farmers of America who defeated the English King and forced him to yield us our independence. Six months after Washington and his staff had raised the United Colonies' flag over the garrison at Cambridge, the Continental Congress met again in Philadelphia to adopt the Declaration, and after that first Fourth of July the great Liberty Bell, over Independence Hall rang out clear and strong to "proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." The only course left for the colonists now was to fight England, cut loose from her altogether and govern themselves. But could they fight England and win ? That was a grave question. They were brave and angry enough to try. It might be a long struggle—but Liberty was worth suffering and dying for. The Declaration adopted by all the delegates of all the late colonies now formed the Thirteen United States of America. </seg>
         <seg id="p413">Nebraska Home Economics Association So another flag was needed—or a real Liberty Flag. In June, 1776, only a few weeks before the Declaration, a committee of three persons, General Washington, Robert Morris (who afterwards became the money manager of the Revolution) and Colonel George Ross, called on Mrs. Elizabeth Ross, the widow of Colonel Ross' nephew, to have a banner made. It has been shown how the idea of the Stars and Stripes had been growing up among all the queer designs that had been flung to the breezes during those years of turmoil and trouble with the Mother Country. The thirteen colonies had often been represented on land and sea by thirteen stripes and sometimes by thirteen white stars in a blue sky or field. These stars were generally five pointed. The Committee seem to have agreed upon placing the thirteen stars in a circle, in a blue canton. But Washington in his drawing had made the star six pointed,.it is said because he wanted the stars different from those in his own coat-of-arms, which were five pointed. Here is Washington's own sentiment expressed some time later, about the first of all the Stars and Stripes: . "We take the star from Heaven, the red from our Mother Country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing Liberty." . ' The Original Betsy Koss Flag Mrs. Elizabeth Ross was a young Widow of twenty-four years of age. She lived in a little house in Arch Street, Philadelphia. She was supporting herself by carrying on an upholstery business. She was famous for her skill with the needle and for her good taste and good sense, as well as for her business ability. She had met John Ross in the upholstery ship where they both worked and was disowned by the friends after running away to be married to him. The Quakers also expelled from the Society of friends all who had anything to do with war. When General Washington and his secret or self-appointed com - mittee needed someone to make up the flag they had planned, they went to the skillful widow Ross as she was sometimes called. Besides Mrs. Ross was a niece, by marriage, of Colonel Ross, one of the committee. When Mrs, Ross saw the sixrpointed star in his drawing, she said to Washington that they should be five pointed, following the German custom. The English custom had six-pointed stars. He remonstrated that it would be^difficult to make a perfect five-pointed star. She then took a piece of paper, folded it, made one clip of the scissors, unfolded it and smilingly field up a perfect five pointed star. They told her "they wanted stripes and stars. Blue canton. The </seg>
         <seg id="p414">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture description given by Congress was a "constellation" of a group of stars but they could not arrange it to look well, so they decided on the circle of stars. As there is no end to a circle, they hoped the new nation they were trying to organize would also be without end—that it would live until the end of time. As for Betsy Ross, she had very little to do with designing the flag beyond showing how easily she could make the five-pointed star for it. But she followed the directions given her by Washington and his committee and made the first flag of the United States of America. The more you know about the Star Spangled Banner, the better and happier you will be-and glad that you are living in the greatest and freest country on the earth—The United States of America. The history of the Flag is a sad story too-of desperate hardships, struggles and sufferings; of the terrible battles on land and sea It has gone through all these just so it may wave, as it does now—"O'er the land of the free, and the Home of the brave." Still the Story of the American Flag is as entertaining as any ro - mance, and as thrilling as any tale of adventure you have ever read or heard, and every stripe and star, yes, every red, white and blue thread of our dear old flag is woven with history-the history of the United States: Mrs. Gard: This morning we enjoyed the splendid address given us and we are looking forward to hearing Dr. Wieman again. It gives me great pleas - ure to introduce Dr^ Wieman again to you. She is going to talk to us on the subject, "A Working Philosophy of Life for Ourselves and Our Children in These Confusing Times." Dr. Wieman. A WORKING PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN IN THESE CONFUSING TIMES DR. REGINA WESTCOTT WIEMAN Somebody has said that a philosopher is one who is hunting in a dark room on an inky night for a black cat which isn't there This epigram contains enough truth to make us all laugh a bit—all of us at any rate except the most serious-minded of academic philosophers The average person mistrusts somewhat both philosophy and philosophers. Zl_ __ T he/ ndS S° large a cap between the thinking u__ h,__ °77 °7- Yet each °f us is a Philosopher: each of us is building up a philosophy of life. The chief difference between the amateur philosopher and the professional is made clear in looking at the question which each is trying to answer. The professional philos - opher asks, What ,s the nature of reality?" The amateur asks, "What </seg>
         <seg id="p415">Nebraska Home Economics Association view of life will help me most in the practical problems of living?" The former is interested in the total heighth and depth and expanse of all reality: the latter is, interested in understanding reality only when and in so far as it will contribute to the conduct of life. A working philosophy of life is that system of concepts or views which we have developed out of our experiences, and which we have organized into an order that Will guide our living. No two individuals have precisely the same philosophy, though many of us have enough ideas or views in common to enable us to group ourselves according to our principles and policies of living. This term, a working philosophy of life, is a comparative newcomer in bur vocabulary. There is good reason for this. In the earlier years of our national life, people lived in small, intimate neighborhoods.. Their patterns of living were set up by the local church, the town fathers, the schoolmaster and the parents, particularly the father, in the home. These authorities thought that they knew what was good and evil; true and false, beautiful and ugly, and unifying and anti-social to a rather great degree. They were recognized as authorities by all the com - munity. Indeed, it was pretty hard to go wrong in those days when al - most everybody thought the same way and conducted his life according to the common pattern. It is no wonder that implicit obedience came to be regarded as the virtue par excellence. And of course obedience will Work out well in a community where life moves so slowly that no one is conscious of change and where everyone has about the same Way of Life.! 7 .'"=_": -'.-¦".- But today there is no common Way of Life recognized by the ma - jority as the best; there are no authorities whom we credit with know - ing what goodness and truth, beauty and community are. There is con - fusion among our thinkers and teachers, uncertitude within us, and a rushing whirlwind of commercialized diversions which tries to prevent our thinking at all. Where is the old, revered virtue-of obedience? What can it do for us in a world where there are no sure authorities to obey? Parents in this modern world who set obedience as a first requirement in the child are almost surely damaging the child's whole life. Successful, effective living is not so easy as it used to be. Obe - dience won't work as it used to. Instead, each of us has to build up for himself an understanding of what goodness, truth, beauty and com - munity are, of the forms in which these can be found today, and of how he may secure the most possible of all that is valuable in life. In place of obedience as the effective virtue, we must come to see that devotion to the growth of good, whether present or unforeseen, is the only Way of Life that yields the greatest values in living. We must' learn to hold ourselves in readiness and to prepare ourselves for the fullness of each concrete situation and to commit ourselves to the best that is or may be. We must learn to seek all the meaning we can find in each situation </seg>
         <seg id="p416">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and in the possibilities it promises. But if we are not to become con - fused or lost to this swiftly changing, deeply challenging Way of Life," we must have built for ourselves an understanding of the nature and quality of the materials and situations of life. This means that we must have a reasonably adequate philosophy of life. Rather I should say that we must not only have a philosophy, but we must be ever developing and reforming our philosophy because the life around us is developing and re-forming all the time. And so it is that the changes that have come into our national modes of living have made it necessary that every individual develop a working philosophy for his own guidance if he is to be other than a parasite, a scavenger, a jelly - fish or a helpless victim of every passing circumstance. What are the views of the materials and situations of living which must enter into the working philosophy of most modern individuals? Perhaps if we discuss some of these, we can improve our own philoso - phies. I'll list some briefly. 1. A view of problems that sees them as opportunities rather than as catastrophes or inflictions. Such a view inspires us to inventiveness, creativeness and deeper study. 2. A view of change, social change and individual change, that prompts us to seek out all the meanings in each change, incorporate the best of all the meanings of the past, and relinquish the outworn ones for those among the new that are better for this day and age. We must be open-minded, neither so conservative as to petrify nor so over-suggestible as to have chronic jitters. 3. A view of catastrophe, whether through loss of property or op - portunities or employment or of loved ones, that steadies us into making a better fresh start than we could have done had we not first possessed the things lost. If we are not better equipped for living from having had these things and lost them, then the having of them and not the loss is the chief tragedy. 4. A view of happiness that recognizes that it is never found by him who directly seeks it. There is only one sure road to happiness. It comes to those who have a worthwhile objective and who see that they are making progress toward it. 5. A view of love as something that goes on and grows wherever persons truly share interests with each other. The feeling is not the prime fact of love but rather only something which accompanies this process of sharing interests with each other. This view must go far enough to reveal the fact that no plans or programs of government or of industry or of science can ever build a better social order until man - kind has been trained by the right kind of community life in the family and the church and the school, for constructive participtation in the </seg>
         <seg id="p417">Nebraska Home Economics Association * building of the larger communities of business organizations, of towns, nations and international leagues. 6. A view of freedom as the opportunity to express and improve our loyalties rather than as the opportunity to do as we please or to do nothing at all. This means that freedom can never be granted to anyone, but has to be earned. It means also that no one man can have freedom to any great extent while others connected with his living are not free. The conditions of freedom can be built only by cooperative endeavor. ¦ 7. A view of humankind as the only existing means by which the world and life can be progressively organized into the greatest riches of value. Man is made to live dangerously so that an unlimited growth of values may take place. But he shrinks back and refuses to live so except where he is educated to understand his place in the universe. 8. A view of God's work as that of growth, all the way from flowers and crops to personalities and cultures. We say that God is love because He always works toward unity, developing families, fel - lowships and world brotherhoods. Love is required of us because it is necessary if we are to provide the conditions in everyday life wherein God can and does work. o_y where love is can growth flourish. 9. A view of education, no matter in what place or by what method, as the process by which society surrounds each person with those con - ditions by which he will be progressively woven into the community of meaning which life has and devote all his abilities in service to this community of meaning. A person can get the most out of life only by the quality and extent of his meaningful connections with nature and things, persons, cultural processes and institutions. Education must prepare the individual for these connections and help him to make them. I.;. i Are all these views of practical significance in our everyday living right here and now? How do such vieWs become important in terms oif all the matters that go to make up the ordinary day of the ordinary citizen? Let me answer by citing one or two case studies which show what great power over his living the views of a person exert. There are two other very important things which we should con - sider in regard to an adequate, effective philosophy of life. First, how are we to know that what we are selecting for our philosophy is truly good, not evil; genuinely true, hot false; surely beautiful, not ugly; and certainly working for and against community among mankind ? Or, having found some things that are good, that are beautiful, that are true and that are unifying, how are we to know which among these are of the greatest value? Philosophers have recorded for us a number of quite different answers to this problem. There is time for presenting </seg>
         <seg id="p418">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture only one, and this one must be, naturally, the one which I have found to be most valid. Those things, or interests, bring most value into life which most effectively work together and mutually support each other, and which reach out farther into the world. When our interests are of the sort to do all this, they develop progressive integration of personality for the individual and increasingly meaningful community for the group. The last important thing to consider is the functionalizing of our philosophies of life. That is, we must use them as the materials out of which we must develop the practical codes, techniques, skills, ideals and purposes for everyday living. However adequate and noble a phi - losophy of life is, it does no good to us nor to society until it becomes expressed in the terms of our everyday conduct of life. The blueprints and the specifications for a house or a barn are not very significant until workmen express them in buildings and persons use the build - ings after they are constructed. So it is that our views take shape as standards, objectives, attitudes and other habits, methods and policies and procedures before they are worth much. This is the art of living. We can get much help in this art from society, but primarily it de - pends upon practice. Yet not practice alone, but practice followed by reflection, discriminative decision and reorganization of the self to new values, to better levels of meaning as these emerge. HOBNOBBING WITH HOMEMAKING EDITORS Mrs. Gard: We have now come to the part of our program that we call "Hob - nobbing With Our Homemaking Editors." We are all familiar with their names, and it is fine to meet them and actually come to know these folks. I want to first introduce Mrs. Anna Dee Weaver, Home Depart - ment Editor, Nebraska Farmer, Callaway, Nebraska. Next we meet Mrs. Julia Kiene, Homemaking Editor of Capper's Farmer, Topeka, Kansas. We have another guest from Topeka, Kansas, Mrs. Ida Migliario of Household Magazine. PRESENTATION OF NEBRASKA PRESIDENTS Mrs. Gard: We have a number of other people with us this afternoon whom 1 am sure you will be glad to know if you do not already know them. They are the Nebraska Presidents, and I think we should first hear Mrs. E. E. Hartz, who is President of the Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture. Mrs. Hartz: </seg>
         <seg id="p419">Nebraska Home Economics Association j Mrs. Hartz: I wish to say as president of this organization that I have en - joyed the women who have come to the meetings as well as our special guests. May I, as your president, thank you on behalf of all of your officers and committees for your help and interest, and welcome you and our guests this afternoon? Thank you every one. Mrs. Gard: I think we should know the first lady of Nebraska, Mrs. Roy L. Cochran: :Mrs. Cochran: .. ! I want to tell you how much I have always enjoyed the meetings of Organized Agriculture. And too, I want to confess that the reason I.was out of the room when my name was called the first time was because I was back in the dressing room visiting with the women from Lincoln County. I was born and raised in Lincoln County and I was so proud and happy to know that Lincoln County had such a fine rural chorus to send to Lincoln for us to enjoy here. I just had to go back there and visit with them and find out all about some of my old friends. I wanted to visit with Mrs. Lannin who gave us her flag lecture. I was asking questions and hearing about the folks out there.- . • -'¦."... Last year, and the year before, I attended these meetings and I can honestly say to you that there are no meetings that I enjoy any more, or as much as Organized Agriculture. I think the work that the Extension folks are doing in the state is second to none. Thank you all. ' Mrs. Gard: 7 ; Miss Evelyn Wolph of Nehawka is President of the Nebraska Council of Home Demonstration Clubs. May we have a few words from you, Miss W°^Ph?- Miss Wolph: j 7 . As President of the Nebraska Council of Home Demonstration Clubs,.l bring jyou greetings from our new organization, which had its beginning January 7, 1937. It has for its object, "to develop, strengthen, and correlate all interests which have for their purpose the advancement of home and community life in the state of Nebraska; to develop leadership and initiative among Nebraska women; to for - mulate and. develop the Home Demonstration Program of the Agricul - tural Extension! Service." We trust that this fine object may ever be in the minds of our </seg>
         <seg id="p420">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 11,379 members. By planning and thinking together, we trust that we shall be more able to satisfy the needs for more constructive Home Demonstration work. Home Demonstration work was organized not for self alone, but for the welfare of all women, consequently it has lived and grown far beyond anyone's expectations. It must be a satisfaction for those who have helped in further - ing Home Demonstration work, to feel that they have had a part in enriching the lives of Rural America. We trust that the Nebraska Council may be of assistance in this work. It has been said that "in Extension Service we have men and women who know their subjects and themselves live and impart the inspiring life; men and women who live and will continue to live in the hearts and minds of the people they serve, through the years to come, because they stand for something worth while." I consider it a privilege for the Nebraska Council to cooperate with them. Since 500 women from sixty-seven counties attended our first state meeting at North Platte in June and 90 Nebraska women attended the National Home Demonstration Council meeting at Man - hattan, Kansas, in October, we know that there is much interest in our organization. We trust that those who have affiliated with the Council have received benefit, but, please remember, give in order that you may receive. We usually gain that which we give. As two of our past County Chairmen said yesterday in the Recognition Service: "Give to the world the best you have, And the best will come back to you." We urge all clubs to come into our organization. We need you, your advice and your help, and you need the Council. Women cannot mingle in this way without much good being derived. New ideas are gained, new friendships are formed and the contacting of national, state and county workers leads to richer, more abundant living. The very finest people in our country are putting forth every effort to better American living. Let us realize "that it is the little things that create differences— that in the big things of life, we are as one." By cooperating we shall be able to accomplish much for the en - richment of every life and the betterment of every home and every community. I represented our state at the Manhattan meeting. I wish to thank the organization for this privilege. I gained far more than </seg>
         <seg id="p421">Nebraska Home Economics Association I was able to give. The trip with Miss Brown and the State Specialist was most pleasant. When I knew that ninety Nebraska women were present, I more fully realized the task before me. Let us hope that "our task may have a vision that shall be the hope of the whole world."

Mrs. Howard Mercer, Gibbon ."- Miss Marjorie Smithey, Beaver City I wish to have you meet these most able helpers. I would not forget the help of Miss Florence Emmett, Geneva, District C, and Miss Ethel Saxtpn, Lexington, District D, who were on the board last year. Mrs. Ethel Bowen, Hebron, was of such valuable assistance in the pre-organization. She was President of the Home Demonstra - tion Agents Association last year. Miss Helen Suchy, Fremont, takes her place this year. With such a fine group of women to assist me and so many very capable, willing workers in our clubs, how much good we should accomplish. I thank you very much, officers, directors and helpers. I most sincerely appreciate the advice and help of Miss Brown and the State Specialists. Our Cass County Home Agent, Miss Bald - win is. ofj. much help. Her services are so worth while. Miss^orence Downs, Home Agent of Lincoln County, and her assistants fee most royal hostesses at our June meeting at North Platte. We appreciate their many, many kindnesses. Mrs. E. E.

We thank you very much, Miss Brown, Specialist, Mrs. Hartz, Miss Downs and Miss Baldwin. I wonder if we fully appreciate the real worth of all these people. Without them I'm afraid I should be at a loss. Let us all assume the task of carrying on the vision which shall develop satisfying family life. We need honest and clear thinking citizens now as never before. From the rural communities must come the citizens who shall be the leaders tomorrow. Let us all, men, women and children, of all organizations cooperate in making our communities such fine places in which to live, that people young and old, will have a greater appreciation for the ideas and ideals of the Rural Community. Mrs. Gard: Another guest we have with us today is Mrs. G. F. Powell from the Parent-Teachers' Association. Mrs. Powell. Mrs. Powell: I am happy indeed for this opportunity to appear here and bring brief greetings from the Nebraska Congress of Parents and Teachers. I was just thinking as I sat and listened to the program this afternoon that any organization that includes parents must be a home economics! organization. The beginning of the Parent-Teachers organization in America was of course for that purpose and object, called the Na - tional Congress of Mothers. Our scope of work today is in the home as well as the school. Another reason I am happy to be here is because for many years it has been my privilege to work in the Department of Rural Teachers Training at Kearney; therefore my heartbeat is greater for rural Nebraska. Whenever the state organiza - tion can be of service to you please feel free to write to me at Kearney. The headquarters for our organization is here in Lincoln, but I will be glad to hear from you at my own office in Kearney at any time. Come in and see me. I wish I might become acquainted with every one of you intimately. Mrs. Gard: Mrs. Anna Dee Weaver is here to represent the Nebraska State Home Economics Association and I wonder if she will not say something to us on behalf of that organization. Mrs. Weaver: I think perhaps twice on a program in one afternoon is too much for any one person, but here I am again. Many people do not realize what makes up the membership of this organization with such a long sound- </seg>
         <seg id="p423">Nebraska Home Economics Association ing name. Its members are home economics teachers, dietitians, tea room managers, extension workers and homemakers. I have been noting the various organizations interested in Organized Agriculture; and we have the same objectives and we should be much better ac - quainted. I hope we will be in the future. Mrs. Gard: . The next person I will introduce is already an old friend of many of us for our project clubs have a special project this winter which includes her services. It is our reading project and we have had the help and assistance of the Secretary of the Nebraska Public Library Commission, Miss Nellie Carey. Miss Carey: ¦j.'.; For several years I have been coming out to these Organized Agriculture meetings and enjoying them and finding much in them that is worthwhile. I have an especial interest this year because of the reading project of the home demonstration clubs. As Mrs. Weaver said about her correspondence, our office knows many of you through your letters. We are always glad to meet you and have you visit at our office, or when we can come to!your meetings. The exhibit which Miss Johnson explained to you yesterday was designed to show some - thing of the services available to you through the Nebraska Public Library Commission and we hope you will call upon us even more in the future. Mrs. Gard: i 7fc Arthur. L. Smith is known to many of us. She is President of the American Association of University Women and also Chairman of the State Committee on Health Education. Mrs. Smith. Mrs. Smith: ¦ ! • " ' This is. not the first time it has been my privilege and honor to come to these meetings. I hope when it is no longer an official capacity I will have the good judgment to come anyway. As Mrs. Weaver said before, we think we belong to an organization that has as its objective the;furtherance of family welfare. We want better human beings for a better society. As an advisor of the committee on State Maternal and; Child Health, I would beg of you to use that department Find out [how much your community spends on health education and make usejof that service to the people of Nebraska.

         <seg id="p428">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The motion was made and seconded that this report be adopted and that these officers be declared unanimously elected. The motion was carried. Mrs. Hartz: It is now my pleasure to bring to you Dr. Wieman who will speak on the subject "Improving The Family Through Improving Ourselves". Dr. Wieman. IMPROVING THE FAMILY THROUGH IMPROVING OURSELVES Dr. Wieman: The French people have an expression that is very useful to them— bete noir. Literally this means black beast, and it refers to that one dreaded, dreadful thing that spoils your peace of mind. Have you an obstreperous black beast ? I have. Mine comes in the form of a ques - tion frequently asked me by parents. How I do dread it! This question is "What would you do with a child who—?" Each parent has a dif - ferent ending for the question: What would you do with a child who quarrels, or teases, or is saucy, or sucks his thumb, or tells lies, or is always late to school, or any other one of a thousand different be - haviorisms. There are several reasons why I dread this question. One is that nobody, not even a specialist can tell how to work on a problem of child behavior until he knows the child somewhat and until he knows the child's situation. The parent usually says, "But I will tell you all about the child and all about his environment." The parent does not realize that it is the things that the parent does not know about the child, and does not even know that he does not know, which are most often involved in the difficulty. But there is an even more important reason than this why I so dread this question—"What would you do with a child who—?" This is it. When we trace the behavior of the child back far enough we practically always find that it is the parent that we must ask the ques - tion about. The question should run something like this, "What would you do with the parent of a child who teases, or quarrels, or steals, or won't eat, or what not?" This is a much more uncomfortable question, but it is the real one in a great many cases of child misbehavior. The quickest and best way to improve our children and our family life is to improve ourselves. One day a mother who had come to me for pro - fessional help telephoned me. She asked me if I exerted some sort of miraculous power over the people with whom I worked. I emphatically assured her that I did not and asked her why she questioned me so. She said that since her consultations, everything about the family life' •-' had been going so mdch better that she marveled. - She made it clear that it was not just herself that was getting along better, but the whole family. She was on the point of learning that every change which we i </seg>
         <seg id="p429">(¦•!'¦- Nebraska Home Economics Association j make in ourselves affects all the persons about us because others react to our behavior, our moods, our motives and our ideas. | J I wonder if we can see what this really means in terms of the parent's job. It is not the child with whom we are to work—-not !at all. It is with the conditions all about the growing child that we must deal. And the personality of the parent is an important part of this atmos - phere around the child. If we put this into current language welmight say that it is not with problem children that we work but with problem . parents. I know a great many ways in which I am a problem parent. I also know that there must be at least as many ways in which i! am a problem parent that I do not know about. Now there are a good' many parents who realize that they have problems, but they think that they can hide these from the children. This is almost impossible. Children have a special sense with which they feel out what we are really like inside! At least it seems like a special sense to us. I think, however, that it is rather their more direct reading of the signs they see all about them. i How is it that our children know so well that real self of ours that hides behind our assumed self? I First of all, the child is very sensitive to every change in expression in those adults who control his situation. The parent's face is the child's Book of Life. He learns intuitively to watch the weather-forecast .here, i Without being aware of the meanings of the words, he knows neverthe - less when it is fear or love, anger or hope, enjoyment or dislike, de - pression or elation, that is the master-hand that shapes our expression. Regardless of what our words say about our feelings, he reads the signs. Hejknows when our sense of humor is getting the better of our (sense of parental duty in the face of an unusually delicious naughtiness. He knows it, too, when we are smiling with our lips but not Witt our ..heart. .'••"..- .',; !, (Probably the most revealing indicator to the child is our uninten - tional behavior, the things that we do without being very much aware that we are doing them. Our unintentional behavior seems so'very natural to us that we can't see it ourselves unless something makes us aware of what to look for. The way we shake hands, the way we use ourjvqices, the way we go at a piece of work or a problem or an enemy or an unexpected opportunity, what we think is funny, and a million other things we do—these are the things that show what we really are. I've; often said that, if I could make just one law for parents, it would be that they should have to see themselves in a mirror all day at least one;day each week and listen to the reproduction of their own remarks and | demands for the same period of time. All the things that we do by plan for the sake of the children have very little influence compared witli the things we do without thinking. iWhat we invest ourselves in, and how much of ourselves we are </seg>
         <seg id="p430">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture willing to invest in various interests is another indicator of what we are really like. There are many, many of us who say that we have no time for this, and no money for that, and no space for this other, and not enough energy to try out something else. As a matter of fact, most of the time, we do have the time and energy, space and money, but we are spending these on other matters. The child knows that, if we care enough about certain things, that we will devote ourselves' to them. &lt; There are other sorts of things about us that tell the child what we are like—our treatment of other people, especially those who are absent, our approach to problems that make life unpleasant, and other such. The child soon learns that the made-up self we put on, our front, cannot be depended upon. It goes and comes. But he reaches down behind this and feels out the real self of us. He knows that, like it or not, this real self is the one he must live with. We may succeed in putting forth our best foot for occasional company, but our children know our feet and how they carry us. Often enough it is our footprints that mislead the child. It wasn't so long ago that parents thought that it was selfish to think about themselves or take care of themselves. We heard mothers and fathers praised who gave themselves entirely over to the meeting of the demands of their children "with not a thought for themselves." Now we know that this is really selfishness, that the intelligent and generous parent thinks about himself and his situation in those ways and to the amount necessary to keep his life well organized and directed. Sometimes in my private practice I have difficulty in persuading a hardworking mother or father to take the amount of rest required to keep them in zestful condition. When nothing else will affect them, I have found out that they will meet the situation if I ask them to take care of their children's mother or father. All of us can understand this, I think. When each of us sees himself as the mother or father of his children and the wife or husband of his mate, he can see the importance of taking care of this relative of his relatives. Already we have begun to anticipate some of the things that we must do to improve ourselves. The first one is to build ourselves up physically to the point where we have a surplus of energy. This means more than enough energy to carry us through an average day. This is ( more important than we usually realize. If we do not have some re- -' serves of physical energy we cannot be patient when things go wrong, " 1 our self-control is weakened, our nerves and tempers are on the hair I trigger, we have little or no sympathy to spare for others, and we are . very likely to begin to fee) very sorry for ourselves. If parents kept ( themselves in good physical condition, about half the disagreeable hap - penings of family life would be done away with. A second thing that we must do to improve ourselves is to see j 11 I' </seg>
         <seg id="p431">j ! , Nebraska Home Economics Association j that we are well nourished mentally, socially and spiritually. There's nothing much more poisonous than eating our own opinions and ideas oyer and over again. You can tell by looking at some people that their thoughts have turned to vinegar and are pickling their personalities. Not one of us must allow one day to pass without drawing upon some resource which will enrich. our living. It is very easy! to go stale and then think that the world is a dully, dark, dreary, dreadful, devilish dungeon. Many, many family difficulties come because the parents are almost starved to death. They suffer miasmic hallucinations, delirious imaginings, about the world of nature, things and persons. They are self-ostracized. Pretty soon they cannot understand others, not even their own young people. There is really no excuse for such starvation inj the midst of a civilization that makes literature, the radio, all sorts of| transportation to the gathering places of people, and other means of communication so readily available. Some parents in these troubled times may hesitate to go some places on account of lack of the conven - tional type of clothing. There is no doubt but that they are in a very Uncomfortable situation. However, going poorly dressed is not nearly so! serious as being personally starved. j! A third area where parents must improve themselves is in that of the sexual adjustment between husband and wife. Many,; many children are paying a bitter price because father or mother or both have not worked this adjustment out to a reasonable degree of effective - neks. There are a number, of printed helps for this adjustment today. ! A fourth responsibility of each parent is for his own individual growth through the development of some ability or special aptitude or interest of his very own which is not common to the family. Each must have some way by which he can make a unique contribution to the com - mon life, and through which he can win recognition and can sense hispower. The only way that any of us can keep other persons inter - ested in him is to make himself more interesting. I There are other ways in which improvement is necessary—-periodic trips away from the 'family into different situations so that we may gain perspective upon bur jobs; the development of individual friend - ships with appropriate persons outside the family for the stimulus af - forded; the development of some particular study-interest connected with the betterment of one's own vocations in life; these and others are valuable. There is one more than these, however, that I have left until the last because it is so very important. It is the finding of that which we feel to be of supreme value above everything else in the uni - verse and the serving and worshipping of this. It has been said that he] who worships greatness passing by, himself becomes great. Unless you and I worship something outside ourselves and on beyond our - selves, something which compels our full respect, reverence and aspi - ration, pur growth is stunted indeed. It does not matter so much </seg>
         <seg id="p432">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture whether we use the name of God. It does not matter whether or not we can all agree about what God is or is not. What does matter is that our living is religious, that is, that we devote our whole selves to that which we believe is most worthy of the devotion of all men. Religion is the greatest integrating poijver in life. We need to integrate ourselves so that living may be full of meaning and so that we may be persons of purpose and decision. These past years men have devoted themselves to selfish climbing to wealth or power. Thereby they have injured themselves and others. Until we can see that all of us must devote ourselves to the good of our neighbors, the common good, we shall be miserable, confused, provincial personalities. Mankind was made to live dangerously we said, made to aspire toward the truly great. As soon as a husDand and wife both begin to devote themselves to some - thing outside their own selfish ambitions and desires, something truly great, they find that most of the ugly tension between them begins to disappear. They begin to live to promote the growth of the good in the world, and this they can do together. In the end the children will see and feel this. Then they too will begin to worship the greater than themselves. Our task is now clear before us. We parents, in so far as our own living is genuine, ardent, enriched and great, are able to surround our children with the atmosphere needed for their finest development. This environment cannot be made to order by our wills. It appears only when our own living is of the sort to foster it. * * » Announcement was made concerning the General Session schedule for 1:00 p. m.

MOTHERS'VACATION CAMPS Club President: We have a real treat in store for us this afternoon as our club member, Mrs. Gary, is going to tell us about her experiences at Mothers' Vacation Camp. Mrs. Gary related the following story of the Camp: i! . "Well, folks, let me tell you right now, that if you let me begin talking about Mothers' Camp, you may have difficulty stopping me as I'm a camp enthusiast from now on. As you probably know, our Home Demonstration Agent sent us all letters telling about the camp. When I received mine, I read it with passing interest and tossed it on the reading table and proceeded to forget all about it. It was Jean's turn to dust when she found this letter,, and she promptly resolved to pack me away to! camp. With the cooperation of her father and the rest of the children, they managed to persuade me that a vacation would do them gooditoo,—so I went. ¦;-..'. j "The family took me over as we were curious to know what the Curtis School of Agriculture is like. We liked it so well that John has almost decided that he wants to take his last two years of high school there—but that's another story. "We carried the suitcase and my bedding roll up to the girl's Dormitory and went in. There we were met by a welcome smile and a cheery "How Do You Do." One of the Home Agents was in charge of registration and told me where to put my six eggs and six potatoes. She took my other registration fee and assigned me to a j. om upstairs. Since we had arrived early, I was the first one in the room which was later occupied by three other women. I tried out all the beds and de - cided it would be fun to sleep on one of the top 'ones. You know they have double deck beds in order to conserve floor space. It was just like going off to school and I could hardly wait to see who my roommates were to be. When they had arrived, I found them to come from three different counties and did we ever have a good time exchanging ex - periences! "It seemed wise to get my things unpacked and organized for the days we were to be there so I did this before going downstairs. At 5:00 o'clock I heard a whistle so I went down to find that it was the official opening of camp and the program was beginning. There wasn't a chance to feel strange or alone, because we played introduction games and pretty soon we felt as though we could call each other by first names. Too soon, it was time to go to, the dining room to eat and, can </seg>
         <seg id="p434">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture you imagine it, eighty-five mothers sat down to a meal which they didn't plan or prepare. I just thought to myself-Tf I don't watch out, I U wake up.' But it wasn't a dream—it was true. We had this experi - ence nine times and of all the really delightful things which happened, 1 I believe this was the best. The food was deliciously prepared and served, and all we had to do was to enjoy it-we didn't even have to 7i wash our own dishes! -. "Following supper, we gathered out around the lily pool in the 1 outdoor living room of the campus and Miss Leona Davis, the camp f director, explained the camp program to us. She said that this was to i be our own vacation; a program had been planned for us, but that we i were to do the thing we wanted to do. Everyone seemed to feel the 7 way I did, that we'd miss something if we didn't attend the program, so we all participated in the planned events. "Mr. H. K. Douthit, Superintendent of the Nebraska School of Agriculture, extended welcome to us and told us about the many fine opportunities at the School of Agriculture. I right then resolved that '"* I would find time to interview him later regarding the work of the school because, as I mentioned, John is interested in going there and 1 it would help a great deal to find out how much it cost to send a boy to the Curtis School. Since our camp began on Sunday, it seemed appropriate to have Sunday vespers. Mrs. Mackey led our vespers and we had fine music presented by one of the students at the School of Agriculture. "One of the persons whom we enjoyed each day was Mrs. Altinas Tullis. I believe she is a music director at the College of Agriculture of the University of Nebraska. She began the book review, "The House ' of Ex.le" by Nora Wain. This i s a story of an American girl who was adopted into the hearts of a Chinese family. Mrs. Tullis made this story so very real to us that we were surprised when Miss Davis said ," 'i it was time to go to bed. "All summer I have been getting up with the sun in order to get my men folks out to the field so I don't need to tell you folks what a . thrill it was not to have to get up until 6:30. A breakfast warning bell 1 rang and we scrambled down the stairs to our breakfasts. Here again ' we enjoyed sitting down to a meal that we didn't have to prepare and . after breakfast it was fun to sit around the table exchanging early . school experiences. Each woman had something to tell about her early -I days and in this way we found out where each woman was born and - li from what part of the country she had come. The first period on our . program on this morning was by Mr. R. E. Holland. Mr. Holland had come out from Lincoln to be with us for group discussion each morning. ¦ He told us about the plans for using group discussion in our own com- 1 mumties and we had a good time discussing the discussion method with j ' him. The next morning we made plans for conducting a group dis- M !;¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p435">Nebraska Home Economics Association ..".¦¦ cussion and then the third morning we had our group discussion on a topic that we had selected. It was! a fine demonstration of the use of the discussion method and I think each one of us came home with some - thing to try out so some day if you would want me to do it; I would be glad to help lead a group discussion. "One of the things I enjoyed thoroughly was the music. Mrs. Tullis is so full of enthusiasm herself that we can't help but want to sing and even though I had not sung for a long time, I found myself trying out the vocalises and the breathing exercises along with the rest of them. It was such fun to look around and watch the other women so T know what I must have looked like as I opened my mouth wide to say 'ah. After we had learned to breathe better, Mrs. Tullis started us on some songs and one of the lovely things which we worked on considerably was the song, 'Come to the Fair', which we had in three part.music. I believe it is a custom at camp to have some kind of handicraft work and I have brought along today this reed tray which Miss Lillian Raynard helped me to make. I have thoroughly enjoyed using this tray since I came home; I find so many uses for it. Some of the Home Agents, I! believe, a. carrying on this kind of work as a special project in their counties. All too soon it was dinner time again and we had to put away our handicraft things until the next day. After dinner we; had rather a free afternoon for rest or relaxation in which we could do anything we wanted to do. After supper Mrs. Tullis con - tinued with her book review and when it was quite dark we had a health program put on by Dr. J. Warren Bell and Dr. J. R. Thompson who came! from the Division of Maternal and Child Health, State De - partment of Health. They talked to us a while and told us about the State Health Program and then. showed the films, 'How Teeth Grow' and 'The Life of a Healthy Child.' I believe that these films might be available in our county if we wanted to sponsor a health program at any time. There were so many questions asked about teeth that Dr. Thomp - son could not finish, he just had to quit. "On Tuesday morning at breakfast we had the best time discussing our children. If there is anything a mother loves to talk about it is— the children. Our morning program was patterned pretty much the same as on Monday morning; our group discussion, our music period and our handicraft work. At lunch Miss Davis told us about the plans for the evening, that we were to have the annual round-up picnic at Aggie Land, and that we were to come dressed in costume for this picnic. You should have seen the costumes which came from goodness-knows-where when the group assembled for the picnic. It is surprising to find out what women can do with a few red handkerchiefs, crepe paper, and the like when it comes to making costumes. Aggie Land is the picnic ground at the School of Agriculture and when we arrived we spent some time looking around at the turkeys and just enjoying the out - doors. Some of the more venturesome ones had lots of fun swinging </seg>
         <seg id="p436">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture on a rope across a creek. A few had wet feet and spattered clothing as a result of their escapade but it all added to the fun of the evening. The 'Chuck Wagon' arrived and it wasn't long until we were all enjoy - ing a picnic supper. After this a group of Home Agents entertained us with stunts and we all sang cowboy melodies led by Mrs. Tullis. We returned to the dormitory and Mrs. Tullis finished the book review for us. "It was with mingled emotions that I awakened the next morning because I realized that this was the last day of camp. I would be leav - ing the new friends whom I have so enjoyed; on the other hand I would be seeing my family again. "Our morning program followed the same general plan and at noon we had our last meal together after which we gathered upstairs in the living room and sang songs together before we left. Mrs. Tullis sang us a solo as her goodbye gift to us. "The folks came for me about 2:00 o'clock and after goodbyes were said we came home. Three days of vacation passed quickly and the time seemed short, but I realized when I reached home how good it was to see again my husband and children and my chickens, and to see what my garden had been doing while I was gone. If any of you ever have an opportunity to go to camp, I hope you will take advantage of it because it certainly is a way to gain inspiration and courage and pleasant memories that will help one throughout the entire year. "I understand that there were two Mothers' Vacation Camps this year, one was held at Camp Brewster, Omaha, July 20-23; while our Camp at Curtis was held July 25-28. Our registration fee was $3.75 plus the six eggs and six potatoes and I want to tell you right now that it was money well spent. I have given you only a few of the highlights of our program but I do want to say that I am thankful for the privi - lege I had of attending and bringing back this report to you and I hope that it may be your happy privilege to do so next year." Club President: Thank you, Mrs. Gary, for your splendid report. I have mentally resolved right now that next year I am going to Mothers' Vacation Camp. </seg>

         <seg id="p439">Nebraska Home Economics Association •¦ Not long ago, a group of farmers were in my home and this re - mark was made: "Were we to sell all we possessed and pay our. rightful debts, we would be farther behind ; than we were 17 years ago, when we started farming." After they had gone, I thought for a long time about what had been said. It didn't seem possible that fate could be so cruel as to let one-fourth of our life be wasted. However, I am afraid this is a true statement for I come from the part of Nebraska where drouth and depression have worked havoc. I have been privileged to look at the mighty ocean with its restless waves and how I love it. I have been thrilled at the lofty peaks of the mountains and whenever, I view them, I think of the passage, "I will lift up my eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my strength." But I know of no sight more beautiful than that of my own beloved Nebraska with her promise of crops. . ' This spring, I walked through our fields and on one side of me were the plump little berries of the small grains. On the other side was tall waving corn. I know of no sight so thrilling as Nebraska in the spring.. Yet, 72 hours later, after the hot, dry winds, I again walked in those same fields. T could hear the rattle of the tiny,.dry berries in the pre - maturely ripened grain and where once stood the tall, waving corn, now remained only gaunt skeletons, of a promise of a crop. But this fall, those farmers about me were again out planting the seed, the money for which was sorely needed for shoes for the children. This-is- not a figure of speech—l mean it literally—the money was sorely: needed for shoes. I rode the tractor while the wind blew the dirt and fairly imbedded it in my face. It seemed to me a hopeless task. As I walked up from the fields, on either side of the path, the beady-eyed little grasshoppers, seemed to leer at me as if to say "we are only waiting for this crop to come up that we may devour it." Yet the hundreds of farm women about me were going through the same trying problems and when our husbands had faith enough to plant crops in the face of such disaster, we could not walk shoulder to shoulder for' 24 hours a day with men of such faith.as they, without catching a glimpse of their vision. I have lost gold, but I have found faith. I learned a lesson this summer from the tiny, blue-coated swallow. I watched her one day as she made trip after trip to the side of our tank for bits of mud from which she masoned her nest. I do not know how many times she came for bits- of mud, but I know that it was a long tiresome task. At last it was finished,—but the next day I found that tragedy had come and her home was destroyed. But next morning), very early, Mrs. Swallow was again about her work. This time, she seemed to take longer. Whether she was following a more intricate plan or whether she was a bit discouraged, I. do not </seg>
         <seg id="p440">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture know but at last her home was finished and I found it was lined with bits of down. I have read that she plucks this from her own breast. And again tragedy came and destroyed her home. I could not help but wonder if she would have the heart to start again. I was up very early the next morning but the little swallow had been up before me. She had again started her home and this time when it was finished, she had lined it with bits of cotton from a eoS wood tree some distance from the barn. ,_n _ WES 7l _c" f°r S°me weeks and not until ™y «ttle daughter me Z- t bar" did J n°tiCe that Sh6 had a nest ™°* hungry n__, _Tv \7 °n7 eleCtric Heht ™*&gt; *™d "deed of her nestful of bab.es.

It is the .toiof the eagle whoguilds her nest high on a lofty, rocky cliff and when to babies are hatched and feathered, she pushes them from the nest and hey must either learn to fly or crash on the jagged peaks below. True, he swoops down below them and rests their wings for a bit, but again she goes and leaves them to their own devices. I have read too, how scientists have taken a nest of eaglets, shel - tered them and fed them and they have grown into greatf awkward birds, perfectly useless, making no attempt to learn to fly.

But we have learned to use every device possible to stretch our inadequate income. Every lesson that has been sent out to us in project work has been put to use. If the farm wife had any talent, and I believ everj farm „oman has some talent, she has brought it out and used it in such a way as to increase the income. Yes, we have lost wealth, but we have learned self-reliance. fonol^TV 0 °nth 6 Street of our little vill*ge the Saturday following the disastrous winds and saw the banker come up to a tired n:_^r d a: d "We"' john/what d° «** * &amp;*£*£; i 7L, mJlg a Permlssib]e tear from his eye, the old farmer beZtt' 7l 7 " "r C°n fidd and lam -minded f _Sg much on."

I have lost financially, but I have gained courage. ."It isn't so much what the world holds fair, For stars and mud there be, And it isn't so much what's really there, But what we look for we seel" I think of our beloved Abraham Lincoln and how he looked beyond the mud and grime of the war which he so abhorred, and saw the star of emancipation. Were I a Magi, and were I to give to each of you here some gift to carry home, it would not be gold or silver, success or fame, but the ability to look beyond mud and grime and see the Star of Agriculture. ".. . j Women's Sessions 7 Over four hundred women met together during the week to see and hear Mrs. Janet Arthur of the Wheat Flour Institute of Chicago present a demonstration on Tricks in Bread. Homemakers of many years ex - perience expressed delight over this opportunity to witness this splen - did ! demonstration on the making of quick breads. Mrs. Arthur dis - cussed the importance of knowing the kinds of flours and the technique for handling each kind. She. stressed careful handling in order to prevent development of gluten in quick breads. In yeast breads, thorough kneading is required in order to develop and stretch the gluten but in quick breads, a different technique is required. Many failures result from over mixing of this kind of product. Mrs. Arthur prepared and baked these products: - Sour Cream Rolls Quick Coffee Cake With Streusel Savory Turnovers '--..'..:.' !.'..¦¦" ; Quick Butterscotch Rolls Recipe sheets were distributed and recipe books mailed later to the women who attended. </seg>
         <seg id="p442">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture PART IV FOUR-H CLUB WORK The Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture is inter - ested in promoting the development of Four-H Club work in Nebraska. Each year a part of the budget has been set aside for the purpose of stimulating interest in Home Economics Club activities. In 1937 the amount of seventy-five dollars was given to the State Four-H Club leader, Mr. L. I. Frisbie, for the promotion of Four-H activities. This money was used to help defray expenses of four Home Economics Four-H judging teams who participated in the National Judging Con - tests at the National Club Congress in Chicago, in November, 1937. This year the judging teams made unusually good records. These were the girls who represented Nebraska, and their re - spective placings in the National Contest: Canned Foods—First Place Baked Foods—Second Place Hamilton County Perkins County Wilma Lewis (also high Luree Hegwood individual) Dorothy Stevens Imogene Johnson Girls' Room—Third Place Clothing—Second Place Webster County Hamilton County Adeline Byrne Doris Bamesberger Mary Alyce Wensinger Eunice Stauffer These girls have written letters of appreciation to the Secretary of the Home Economics Association for the financial assistance which helped make their trips possible. They have also prepared narratives of their experiences to the National Four-H Club Congress. The stories submitted are similar and each points out the benefits from a trip of this kind. The story by Wilma Lewis of Hamilton County has been chosen for this report. MY TRIP TO THE NATIONAL FOUR-H CLUB CONGRESS By WILMA LEWIS Six members of Hamilton County's Four-H Girls' Clubs met at the Central City depot promptly at noon Saturday, November 27th. Four of them were members of Judging Teams; one of them was the State Cooking Champion and the other a Northwestern trip winner. We were ready to start on the first lap of our journey to Chicago. The Challenger was a very comfortable train and we thoroughly enjoyed our ride to Omaha. </seg>
         <seg id="p443">Nebraska Home Economics Association In the Union Station in Omaha we met the other delegates and leaders. Some of the Four-H'ers talked on the radio before going into the dining room where a lovely dinner and a general get-acquainted meeting were enjoyed. Following that. we boarded the Rock Island and were on our way to the city of Chicago. After experiencing a night in an upper berth, I awoke to find the ground covered with snow. Sometime in the night we had crossed over the Mississippi River but I hadn't known it. We were about an hour late getting into Chicago, but immediately after arriving the entire gang, numbering almost sixty from Nebraska, walked to the Harrison Hotel and had breakfast. Following breakfast the program for the week began with church services in the Auditorium Hotel. The speaker was a young man who had been born in Syria, lived as a beggar lad, and finally in war times learned that he had brothers in the state of lowa. He came across the waters to live with them, work and go to school which was bis biggest desire. He spoke in such an interesting; and forceful way that he held the undivided attention of all his listeners. . After finding our rooms and unpacking, the entire delegation from the forty or more states, Canada and Hawaii, were guests at the Civic Opera Company at a presentation of 'The Magic Key.' It was a won - derful program, featuring an orchestra that one regularly hears, two soloists, a Viennese orchestra, and the radio team Vie and Sade. The entire audience greatly appreciated the opportunity to see and hear at close range such a wonderful program. ;'...'. The bus tour of the city began from the Opera House and ended at the Auditorium Hotel. It covered the most interesting points in the city, including the Negro section where no white person lives, the Jewish Ghetto where the carts were parked in the street and customers bought at ridiculously low prices. Jackson Park was covered with snow as were all other open stretches in the parks and campuses. Time was taken for a visit !to the University of Chicago Chapel which was donated by Mr. Rockefeller. We heard the carillon bells and the great organ played by an expert. Words can't describe the exquisite work - manship of the hand carved woodwork, wonderful masonry and statu - ary. You'd have to see it to appreciate it. We passed the Wrigley building, which by the wayi is made of white stone and is washed an - nually. Floodlights play on it and at night it can be seen from quite a distance. We passed the Lincoln Memorial, saw the shore of Lake Michigan and the Navy Pier a mile distant. We saw a Novelty shop made of glass with life size dummies dancing to the latest dance music. The shops we'd read about and never dared to hope to see, were also seen on our route back to the hotel. ,'.,.'. Since I was a member of a judging team, I stayed in my room Sunday evening and rested instead of going to the Sunday Evening Club with the others. All judging contests were held Monday morning </seg>
         <seg id="p444">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and after a good night's rest, I was able to go to my contest and do my best. The contest was an interesting experience. After talking to some of the other girls, I felt very much at ease and was ready when the final instructions were given. The lady in charge was from the south and had a pleasing southern drawl and a gracious manner which made her a very pleasant judge. Imogene Johnson and I placed and gave reasons for classes of canned carrots and meats and a class of supper menus for June. Menus for a day and a class of peaches were, also judged. After all contestants were finished the judges gave the i: correct placings with reasons. I found that I had three correct placings and two that were very nearly correct. However our scores were not 7 announced to us until Tuesday night. Most of the Nebraska people knew the results before we did. After a hurried lunch, all the contestants rode on the elevated train to the International Livestock Show to see the exhibits and we joined the Nebraska group. At 4:00 o'clock we left on double deck busses enroute to the Medinah Temple as supper guests of Wilson &amp; Co. A delicious meal and highly entertaining acts were included in Mr. Wilson's 20th anniversary celebration. Again we went by bus back to the show and the fifteen hundred delegates paraded in the Arena. It's quite a thrilling experience. All delegates were given green and white knitted caps to wear and the Nebraska folks wore red and white corn shucking mittens, one of each color. When one of us was separated from the rest, all we needed to .•¦¦ do was to wave our red mitten and the rest would wave back and we weren't lost any longer. The mittens were good for the first few days and then we wore red 'N' feathers in our hats. Tuesday morning the girls were guests of Montgomery-Ward &amp; Co., first going to the Adler Planetorium to see an exhibition of the 7 stars and planets and then going to the Field Museum. Everything "l! from mummies, dinosaurs and boa constrictors to priceless jewels, . mounted animals of every species and reproductions of man in the '{ earliest forms of civilization were found there. Then we rode in busses, with police escort, along the shore to the Edgewater Beach Hotel. 7 Following the luncheon and program at which the Montgomery-Ward j scholarships were announced, we journied back again to the hotel to j prepare for the Annua] Banquet to be held in the world's largest ball- {! room at the Hotel Stevens. A play 'Man to Man' was very ably pre- | sented and vividly portrayed the progress of science and mechanism in | regard to speech and communication. The scholarships, leadership and | achievement awards were announced, as were the Health winners. 1 Both entrants from Nebraska won in this contest. 11 It was the same night that we girls found how we had placed, 1 and when they said I had won highest honors, I couldn't realize just fj how much that meant. The Clothing team placed second, and will each 1 I .:, </seg>
         <seg id="p445">Nebraska Home Economics Association receive medals, while our team will receive gold watches. We were especially pleased with the announcement posted by the National Com - mittee, giving a great, deal of the credit to Miss Graff, our home demonstration agent, who so recently passed away. Wednesday morning dawned clear and cold enough to make us step lively while marching to the place where the Northwestern trip winners were entertained at breakfast. I had the honor of having a picture, taken with one of the railroad officials that morning.. As soon as that was over, we joined the rest of the Four-H'ers at the Interna - tional Harvester Company to see the Tractor Works, Twine Mill, etc. A large group picture was taken there. At eleven o'clock Imogene and I, along with some of the health winners and the other National Champion Home Economics Judges, went to the Stock -Show again to, broadcast on the Farm and Home Hour over the N. B. C. network. That was quite a thrill, even though it lasted about one and one-half minutes. A few of us talked for a minute over Station W. L. S. also. After rushing back to the Harvester plant where the rest had lunched, we ate hurriedly and went back by taxi to the Show to have pictures-taken for the newspapers. The whole affair was lots of fun and I really enjoyed talking to the reporters. The two Nebraska boys who were alsoj high individuals and we two girls went to the matinee horse show after the pictures had all been taken. At that show we saw our first polo game, some trick riding, several six horse teams and many acts by pure bred racing horses. Wednesday night was a thrilling night for forty-one girls repre - senting as many, states. It was the night for the Style Review, pre - sented in pageant form. After the white, red and blue ribbon groups were announced, l the champions were named, including Rosa Belle Muntz from David City, Nebraska. She, too, received a gold wrist watch. When We 'came out of the Hall where the event was held, it was snowing lightly, adding a gayer feeling, to an already gay crowd. Thursday was the last day—and a full one. Chicago Mail Order Company entertained all the girls at the College Inn in the Hotel Sherman at breakfast. We walked that morning and our appetites were whetted up to a high degree and we did justice to a good break - fast. A style show of winter clothes and a few advance spring styles were featured along with the radio team, Lulu Belle and Scotty. A visit to the Art Institute was next and was followed by luncheon at the Stevens Hotel. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. were hosts here. Again, Imogene and I had pictures taken] this time with some other cham - pions and the chef of the hotel. As soon as the program was over, the Nebraska group returned to the hotel and made ready to go down town. First we visited Frank Buckjs circus "Bring 'Em Back Alive" at The Fair store. All the animals were brought by him from tropical jungles. The group divided and went to Marshall Field's store. About .¦¦: kv\!¦¦¦¦:.,.v,'. </seg>
         <seg id="p446">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture a dozen of us girls had so much fun riding on the escalator to the ninth floor and down again, that we forgot to shop, but we got a mar - velous view of the entire store.. We spent some time in the dime stores and after getting permission to return alone, I stopped in several other stores including a Chinese shop. There I bought a souvenir and visited with a real Chinaman who spoke English almost as well as I. At six o'clock we checked out from the hotel and the state group ate supper together, making plans for the return trip. At nine-thirty we taxied to the station, boarded a Northwestern train and started home. After a good night's rest, we found ourselves still in lowa but nearing Nebraska. At ten-thirty a. m. the train pulled into Omaha and all but thirteen of us left on other trains. We thirteen stayed on the same train and bade goodbye to one girl at Schuyler, another at Co - lumbus and finally the six of us left the remaining five at Centra] City. They journeyed on to the west end of the state. We were met by Mr. Cook, our county agricultural agent, and taken to Aurora. The trip is over—but the memories linger on. No one will ever know how much trips of this kind mean to boys and girls, until they take similar trips. No one will ever know how much we owe our lead - ers, both county and state leaders, and most especially Miss Graff. Without her we couldn't have been successful and after the tragedy we were challenged to do our best and I'm sure she would be happy, could she know the results. </seg>

HOPPERT: In planning our ornamental program for this year, we had in mind some of the great needs of this state of ours. Our state .doesn't loOk as attractive now as it did ten years ago. When we think of 'Garden Club', many of us think of flowers only, but flowers are only one of the many things the Garden Clubs are in - terested in. We are all interested in flowers but when we see the dilapidated state of oi r streets, we realize that something larger and more extensive than merely flowers jis necessary to bring, back the beauty of our state. With this idea in mind, We had the theme running through our program today of trees and lawns." In addi - ¦ - . '--''¦ !¦¦'¦'' I ' '.-'!' '¦¦¦'••-.¦'' l -¦ - </seg>
         <seg id="p450">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture tion, we have some talent from out of the state who will deal with other phases of beautification. We have many requests coming to our office from new Garden Clubs asking what to feature on their programs. We hope this first speaker will give us some idea 3 along that line and I know you will all be interested in whit she has to say. I am glad to introduce Mrs. A. G. Fish of Denver Regional Vice President of the Federated Garden Clubs. MRS. FISH: Mr. Chairman, Madam President, Members of the Federated Garden Clubs of Nebraska. It is a real pleasure for me to be here. I was anxious to meet with the different constituents of this region. I feel that the Federation of Garden Clubs has done a splendid piece of work in unifying interest in gardens, in conservation work, horticulture and artistic gardens. The dues of the Federation are so small that no club can afford not to federate. We have contacts with the national organization that we would not get other - wise. We have the privilege of availing ourselves of choice lectures on subjects dear to garden lovers. By belonging to this organization, we have a card which enables us to visit gardens in foreign countries as well. As to my work, these are the different things that I feel the Federated Garden Club stands for. Originally nearly every state had local, independent clubs and groups but now the Federation has branches in all but seven of the states. They foster conservation and helpful legislation. They sponsor Junior Garden Clubs to create an interest for the children. All school boards should be encouraged to) offer some form of conservation instruction in the schools This may be brought about through the Junior clubs. The Federation at - tempts to prevent destruction of trees, wild flowers and wild animals and to instil the love of nature in its members. If this love of nature is imbued in a child during his young years, his mind will be diverted from lines of crime and vice. They will be our contribu - tion in later years to the beauty of the world. We are always searching for new things, new varieties of iris roses, sweet peas and even the lowly marigold. Our horticulture chairman, Mrs. Coons who lives in New York has written a book on the flora of South Africa. This may sound impractical for us but it is not, for many of the plants can be imported to this country and will thrive here. It is a book that should be in every library. That is just a sample of horticultural literature that is available through the Federation. Many of these women write columns for daily newspapers which contain much practical and valuable information. It is an opportunity to get the people of a community to thinking about flowers and shrubs, trees and lawns, birds and other forms of useful wild life. </seg>
         <seg id="p451">Nebraska State Horticulture Society Then there are studies on specific subjects. A Federation should take one plan and work it out completely, if possible. For instance, one group took the narcissus and !worked for a year on that one subject, studied the different kinds,'determined the best way of cul - tivating, found what new varieties had been produced, etc. Another thing so enjoyable in the Federation is visiting famous gardens. Mrs. Grouseman told this 1 morning of visiting many beau - tiful gardens in Ohio. We all know of instances where dump heaps and eye- sores have, become beauty spots through a little careful planning and planting. . j '.-¦•¦ . Through membership in a group of this kind, we also learn to know the outstanding people in a community. The Garden Club people have listed plants- and trees that are indigenous to each state and this information is available to all members as well as the names of dealers where the different plants' and shrubs may be obtained.. Take the matter of roadside stands. Much has been done by Garden Clubs to improve the appearance of these. When the Federation of Nebraska decides that certain roadside stands are up to the standard set and presents them with the plaque which Mrs. Grouseman showed you this morning, we will be likely Ito patronize those stands having a standardized sign. We will be i glad too when the time comes that our roadsides are not encumbered with inappropriate signboards. Many clubs have accomplished wonders along this line, refusing to patronize dealers who advertise in that way. A garden center may be established in just a little corner of your library or school where an enthusiastic person can lead others to get enthusiasm. Show children things in nature and teach appreciation of them. Education means to 'lead out' and a teacher must truly be a leader. In this center, besides books on nature, you might have specimen's of birds' eggs, nests and feathers. Help children to become familiar with the bark as well as the leaf of a tree. Children often determine the kind of tree from the leaf, why not from the bark also? Have a seed guessing competition. How many of us are familiar with seeds of different plants and trees? Teach children that the world is beautiful and that there are many interesting things to learn arid know. In this way, they will have less time for cheap movies. .1 When we went to Camden, Maine, for the midyear meeting of Federated Garden Clubs, we heard and saw some very lovely things. They had many fine arrangements of flowers such as you have dis - played here today. One in particular, was a large bowl about 12 inches in diameter, somewhat like the rose bowls we are all familiar </seg>
         <seg id="p452">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture with, completely filled with blue forget-me-nots. Their dish gardens, filled with different kinds of mosses, were very attractive. There were red sunflowers in a bronze jardiniere, a display of grasses in natural tints, no artificial coloring. I wish that you could all attend the national meeting in New York next year. I would like to ask that each state subscribe for a few more copies of the bulletin if possible. They have very little money to work with and need the extra subscriptions. A few life memberships in each state at $100.00 each would also help greatly with finances. Another suggestion I would like to make would be the use of national lectures and slides. You all have pictures from your gardens. If each group would take a few of their best pictures and have them i made into slides, such a regional set of slides could be exchanged ! with those of other regions. This was done in the New England states and I saw them at the meeting in Camden. If you cared to use these New England slides at any time, you may do so. Keep a record of your plant studies. In three years, you would know the ecology of the different plants. You would be able to make some sort of scientific contribution. The records might be such as this—"On March 18th, anemones were blooming." The next year, it might be April and in a few years, you would have a very interesting record of the life habits of that particular plant. Devote ten minutes at every meeting throughout the year to horticulture. Much could be gained from such a procedure. Mrs. Grouseman and I saw a very interesting pit greenhouse in Cleveland this summer. It was a complete greenhouse buried below the surface of the ground, padded on top with oak leaves over the glass to keep it warm. It was artificially lighted and the owner could work in there at any time through the winter. It measured 8' x 12' and was consructed at an approximate cost of $100.00. Contained two [ work benches and appeared to be very convenient. Mrs. Grouseman f has working drawings of this greenhouse with a list of the plants i which could be grown in this set-up. ) I have a few things to tell you about the benefits of a garden \ club in a community. This was my topic but I wanted to talk a -i little of these other things first. I will list the things a Garden Club may accomplish in a community: i (1) Interest people and give information about planting gardens and cultivating plants. (2) Interest people in public acreages, such as parks, cemeteries, road- j side stands, etc. J I </seg>
         <seg id="p453">Nebraska State Horticulture Society (3) A definite place for definite instruction, sort of an adult education .-!".. center. ' 'j • . (4) Junior work.. The schools can incorporate junior work by having lessons in nature study, (5) Nature trips :to study botany but of doors, instead of from books. (6) Develop more and better species of flowers and plants. (7) Study artistic arrangement of flowers. (8) Development of flower shows as an encouragement to horticulture.

I hope the membership of your group may increase as I feel that Garden Clubs are one of the biggest factors in making true Americans. _ thank you. MR. HOPPERT: I am sure we all enjoyed the suggestions which Mrs. Fish has given us; I also want to announce that Mrs. Fish is a poetess. She has written more than thirty poems on the wild iris. These may be purchased from her at a small cost. Our next speaker will talk on trees. Hfe- has been with the Shelterbelt and Forest Service a number of years and,- more than anyone else, realizes the importance of trees to our landscapes. I am sure you will be glad to hear what he has to say. I am glad to introduce Clayton Watkins, Senior Extension Forester, of the Uni - versity of Nebraska. : MR. WATKINS: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen—l will make my talk very brief because a lot of the things of which I am to speak you already know. You have just heard a very interesting and instructive talk by Mrs. Fish and you have other speakers with interesting subjects to follow. For these reasons, mine will be short, I want to comment on the resolution of the Federated Garden Clubs. It shows that you are thinking for yourselves. The suggestion of one of your members that we have education rather than legisla - tion on tree planting was very good. '.!..'•-. </seg>
         <seg id="p454">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture To get to my subject, "Shall we continue to plant street and shade trees in Nebraska?" This is a question which I think you have all answered in your own minds from the action of your organization and as individuals. I know that the local Garden Club, with Mrs A. C. Nelson of Lincoln as president, has carried out several projects along this line. It isn't easy to plant trees and get them to grow under present conditions. It wasn't easy in the early days when the settlers. brought their trees from distant states. Conditions in some cases were even worse than they are now. There doesn't seem to be any question as to whether or not we should go on planting trees but there is some question as to how it can be accomplished. Since the pioneers proved that trees could be grown on the treeless plains, we will continue their work even though the last few years have been ' discouraging. With the present shortage of rainfall, we know of course that the moisture content of the soil is low. In many cases, trees were planted too thick. Sometimes it is just as important to take out '" trees, where they are too thick, as it is to plant more. The Horticultural Society has probably done more along this line of tree planting in years past than any other organization. Their annual reports since 1900 show how much thought they have given to trees Our landscapes in this part of the country show the result of this I mention this because of your connection with that organiza - tion. They did a lot of pioneering and experimenting before we had any experimental work in the line of tree planting. They laid the ioundation for our present program. Our present situation is one in which we are all interested, the 7&lt; losing of trees in our yards, along our streets, on our farms and windbreaks and we all wonder whether it could be changed by one h.ng or another. We can name three reasons for our loss of trees (I) old age, (2) insects, (3) drouth, with the latter probably being more to blame than the other two. No matter which way we go in study or observation, we come back to the same problem-lack of ' 1 soil moisture. It would seem in cities where water is available that ' we could overcome this obstacle and we do try but we don't go far enough. We must water deeply.

There is not enough space for roots below the ground when the crowns touch overhead and competition for mois - ture is the result. Dr. Wiggans willgo into detail on this particular subject in his talk later in the program. We live in a territory of limited rainfall. This is not the first time Nebraska has.lost lots of trees. During the period that weather records have been kept, since 1850, we have had two" similar drouths. It has been reported to Dean Burr that a certain mound in Butler county is simply dirt, which blew in around a grove of trees more than 50 years ago. Another thing which we sometimes fail,to con - sider in connection with soil moisture in relation to trees 'is that the only food a tree can absorb is that which is in water solution. Soil moisture serves as a medium to transport food. The amount of food a tree gets depends upon the amount of moisture in the soil. I would like to emphasize proper methods of tree watering. The Extension Service has a circular which will answer a great many of the questions in regard to watering. It appears that the best way is a series of holes made with a bar or small auger under the out - side edge of the crown as a means of getting moisture down, to the feeder roots. These holes should be 18 to 36 inches deep, connected with a ditch into which the hose may be allowed to run for several hours. If the spray method is used, water must run for long periods before moisture will soak down to the feeder roots of the tree. The unnatural conditions in cities with which trees have to com - pete are pavement, graded lawns and drainage systems. Perhaps we can grade our lawns in order to keep water standing on them in - stead of draining off immediately. Smoke also causes some damage to trees in a city. We must supplement the natural rainfall or use plants which do not require so much water. In a narrow parkway with pavement on one side and sidewalk on the other, trees have a poor chance of survival unless they are given very good care. . We have! no alternative but to continue to plant trees. It wouldn't be much! of a state or a country if we didn't plant and enjoy watching trees grow. In spite! of the fact that this was a plains country in the beginning, we have had trees and we want to keep them. In order to grow trees, we must give attention to ground preparation, care after planting, careful pruning and spraying. Thrifty trees seldom suffer severe attacks from insects or disease. The question was brought up of planting a tree where one has died. In all probability, the soil moisture is exhausted aiid it would be foolish to plant another tree without preparing the soil for it. </seg>

It is a subject which the Garden Clubs are all very much interested in and one on which they have already accomplished a great deal. Our next speaker has had considerable experience with grasses of various species arid varieties. The lawns in most of our Nebraska cities and towns are terrible to behold. In the country it is even worse. It is only natural to look for something. new and better when the old lawn is to be replaced. We thought it might be of interest to you to hear what the Agronomy department knows about the various grasses that might be used. Mr. Anton Frolik is our speaker and I am glad to introduce you to him. . GRASSES ADAPTED FOR HOME ORNAMENTATION A. L. FROLIK. 7 Department of Agronomy, '..!'-,'¦. University of Nebraska. The most common use of grass in home ornamentantion is for lawn purposes, but there are several other ways in which grass may be used to advantage. Tall, robust grasses such as fountain grass (Pennisetum ruppelii) (Fig. 1), Ravenna grass (Erianthua ravenme), and eulalia (Miscanthws sinensis) may be used as background plants in a garden or planted in the center of flower beds in a. large lawn or parkway. Short grasses with attractively-colored leaves, such as blue fescue (Festuca ovina var. glauca) may be used as border plants along the margins of flower beds. Some grasses with unusual or graceful panicles, such as broadleaf uniola (Vniola latifolia) quaking grass (Briza maxima), and feathertop {Pennisetum vUlosum) may be grown for winter bouquets. </seg>

Watering should not be too frequent, but the soil should be soaked to a depth of several inches when, the lawn is watered. The grass should be mowed at a height of about two inches. During prolonged dry periods it may be advisable to discontinue mowing entirely until more favorable climatic conditions again prevail. It is ordinarily advisable to re - move the clippings since the clipped grass may prevent the develop - ment of a dense sod. Fertilization of the grass may be advisable. If manure is used it should be well rotted, weed-seed free, and applied as a thin layer. Good commercial fertilizers can be satisfactorily used. Fertilizers should ordinarily be applied during the early spring months. Com - mercial nitrogenous fertilizers are best applied two or three times in preference to one application per year. '¦'.'

         <seg id="p460">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Native Grasses for Lawns Under conditions in the western two-thirds of the state where bluegrass can not be satisfactorily maintained, two native grasses, namely blue grama and buffalo grass may be effectively used. These two grasses have the principal advantage of being highly drouth resistant and yet they are quite attractive as lawn grasses. These two grasses have an additional advantage over bluegrass in that they con - tinue to grow during the summer months, whereas bluegrass becomes more or less dormant unless well watered. Buffalo grass is a low-growing grass spreading vigorously by creeping above-ground stems. The male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. It has fine, light green leaves. Blue grama is a bunchgrass growing somewhat taller than buffalo grass. Blue grama also has rather fine leaves and a medium green color. A buffalo grass lawn can be established vegetetively by trans - planting approximately 4-inch cubes of sod one to two feet apart. Buffalo grass sod can usually be found in local pasture lands. in much of the state. The soil between the sod-transplants should be kept relatively free of weeds until the grass has spread over the bare ground. A lawn can usually be eestablished in one to two years with Blue erama grass lawn at North Platte substation. the method previously rescribed. Buffalo grass may also be propa - gated by seed but seed is not generally available in commercial chan - nels. The seed can be harvested but more attention needs to be given to methods of harvesting before it becomes a profitable practice. </seg>
         <seg id="p461">Nebraska State Horticulture Society Blue grama grass can be propagated by seed only. It should be seeded and handled in about the same way as bluegrass except that less watering is necessary. Some watering is beneficial in obtaining a dense sod. The time of seeding also differs from that of bluegrass; it should be seeded somewhat later in the spring; i.e., daring April, and fall seeding is not advisable. Blue grama seed is not available commercially at the present time, but it can be harvested quite easily by stripping with hand or power strippers. Ornamental Grasses Although many kinds of grasses are grown for their ornamental value, it is rather difficult to know just what species to plant and where the seed or plants for transplanting may be obtained. A number of species may well be considered as having at least some possibilities under Nebraska conditions. Fountain grass (Pennisetum ruppelii), purple fountain grass (Pennisetum macrostachyum), Ravenna grass (Erianthus ravenrue), and ribbon grass, also called gardner's garters, (Phalaria arundinacea var. tecta) have been successfully grown on the Agricultural College campus of the University of Nebraska for many years. All of these species are rather robust grasses and with the exception of ribbon grass have large feathery panicles. All of them are used as border plants or planted in beds. All four species are perennials, but the two fountain grasses ordinarily winterkill in Nebraska, whereas the other two species are winter hardy. At the Agricultural College, the fountain grass is usually started from seed in the greenhouse during the early spring months and trans - planted to the field after the danger of frost has passed. Purple fountain grass is difficult to start from seed. The plants are usually moved from the field into the greenhouse in the fall of the year and those are cut up into smaller transplants at the time of moving them into the field in the spring. Ravenna grass and ribbon grass may be started from seed either in the field or in the greenhouse with subsequent transplanting to the field. These two species are hardy enough to persist as perennials. Other coarse, robust grasses with large panicles which offer some possibilities as ornamentals are pampas grass (Cortaderia selloana), feathertop (Pennisetum villosum), and several varieties of ulalia (Miscanthus sinensis). There are several tall, coarse grasses exhibiting considerable beauty which are adapted to wet habitats. These include the common reed grass (Phragmites communis), Giant reed (Arundo donax), and wild rice (Zizania aquatica). Common reed grass and and wild rice are plants native to Nebraska, being found in low, swampy areas. Common reed grass is a hardy perennial, whereas </seg>

Common reed and giant reed can be propagated by trans - planting pieces of the creeping rootstocks. Wild rice, an annual plant, can be satisfactorily propagated by seed. A number of additional grasses, the inflorescences of which can be used to advantage particularly for making winter bouquets are quaking grass (Briza maxima), hair-grass (Eragrostis curvula), broad - leaf uniola (Uniola latifolia), and jobs-tears (Coix lachryma-jobii). Quaking grass and broadleaf uniola have attractive, papery, pendulous infloresences, hair-grass has very long slender leaves and a hair-like panicle, and jobs-tears is attractive because of its ivory, bead-like ' fruits. In addition to the grasses commonly used for ornamentation pur - poses throughout the country, there are a number of perennial grasses -"-''l native to Nebraska which make rather attractive grasses in flower gardens. Three grasses growing commonly in the sandhills region are attractive. These include the hair-like love-grass, (Eragrostis trichodes) ," Blowout grass (Muhlenbergia pungena), and sandhill fruestem (Andro - pogon hallii). Hair-like love-grass produc?s very long, purplish, bushy panicles. It can be started from seed in flats in the greenhouse and successfully transplanted to the garden. Blowout grass is a very short plant with short, rigid, silvery-green leaves and with purplish-brown, delicate hair-like panicles. It can probably best be propagated by </seg>

The following are suggested as having some possibilities: side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), Indian Grass (Sorpfcostntm nutans),-.little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius) , and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum).

It is suggested that anyone interested in obtaining seed or plants of the commonly cultivated ornamental grasses write to Seed World, 223 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois for a list of dealers. In order to give the people whose hobby is gardening an oppor - tunity to try out some of the more attractive native grasses in their gardens, a limited number of small packets of seed of several grasses have been prepared by the Department of Agronomy of the College of Agriculture, University of Nebraska. The species available are Indian grass, side-oats grama, sandhill bluestem, and switchgrass for home ornamentation, and buffalo grass and blue grama for lawns. ; Anyone interested may secure samples by writing to the Department of Agronomy. During the last year, a great many people came to our office with questions about new grasses appearing in their lawns since the drouth seasons. One in particular was the sheathed wire grass. In a great many cases, this new grass has replaced the bluegrass. What can we do about our lawns if they are full of weeds as a result of drouth ? Here in Lincoln, we haven't done much research work on lawn grasses. Our work has been with broader phases, especially the place of grasses in soil conservation. Even though our present lawns are gone, I still think bluegrass is the grass we should reseed in the eastern one-third of Nebraska. Mixtures are sometimes recommended and, for the first few years, you will have several varieties but sooner or later, perhaps in three to five years, the lawn goes to bluegrass so a person might about as well sow a pure bluegrass seed. The first thing in establishing a new lawn is to be sure that you have a good seed bed. How shall we prepare this seed bed? Usually, in the early spring, we get anxious to get the seed into the ground and do not take time enough to prepare the ground properly. The ideal seed bed is spaded or forked to a depth of 6 or 7 inches. Break up the clods and rake down until every one of the big clods are broken up. The seedlings are very small and cannot survive among many large clods. Let the seed bed stand for two or three weeks. Now, in buying the seed, it will pay you to get that seed which has a high purity and germination test. To get even distribution in seed - ing, plant both ways back and forth across your lawn. When cover - ing, use the back of the rake gently. The seed is small and must not be covered too deeply. Then roll it if you can get a roller. In watering, be careful not to use a big spray or much of your seed i </seg>
         <seg id="p465">Nebraska State Horticulture Society will be washed away. Once you start to water, keep the ground moist until the plants are of a good size. If the plants get up a fourth of an inch and then the ground is allowed to dry out, these tiny seedlings will die. In many'bluegrass lawns, patches have died out and weeds came in. People sometimes pulled the weeds and planted grass seed but with little good resulting. Perhaps the seed came up but when the weather turned hot, grass died and water grass filled the space. I would recommend, if the patch is big enough, that you work it over just as though you were going to make a new lawn. If the patch is small, perhaps the addition.of a plant food such as ammonium sulphate, with plenty of water, would help the seed to get a start. Q. What about dandelions? A. This question always comes up. If grass is given enough water and nitrogen, it will crowd out the dandelions. Q. How about watering lawns.?.. A. People will run water on their lawns for only a few hours each evening. The soil underneath the surface layers is dry and a light application every day or so on the top inch or inch and a half has a tendency to keep the roots very near the surface. If you fail to water then for two or three days, you are likely to get injury. The water should be run long enough at one time to soak down at least one foot. Q. What is the proper length to mow grass? A. At Manhattan, Kansas, they have done some research work on determining the correct height to mow grass.•; They concluded that to mow shorter than two inches on the average lawn weakened the grass too much. The ordinary. lawn mower is set to mow seven - eights to one inch high and should be raised by enlarging the wheels on the mower if the setting cannot be made two inches. . Many inquiries have been made about the brown patches appear - ing on the lawn at the Capitol building. These patches were caused by fungi of two types. One works at the surface and kills the leaves and the other type goes.down into the crowns and destroys the plant more completely. This can! be controlled by applications: of several different types of mercuric chloride. Specific recommendations may be obtained from our department. " . ¦_¦ Q. Would the seed of all these grasses grow in our yards? They would be pretty around pools. A. Yes, they are native to Nebraska and should grow well. The only difficulty would be in obtaining the seed at just the proper time. </seg>
         <seg id="p466">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Q. What about peat moss on a new lawn? A. Very good, if plenty of water is used. Of no special value where watering is not possible. MRS. GEO. SMITH: I have tried cotton seed meal and found it to be much more satisfactory than peat moss. MR. HOPPERT: We could spend the rest of the afternoon dis - cussing our lawn situation and it would be time well spent but we must go on with the rest of our program. I am going to ask Mrs. Grouseman to introduce our next speaker. MRS. GROUSEMAN: Mrs. Whiting of Mapleton, lowa, is an ardent iris fan. In planning this program, we thought you would enjoy seeing Mrs. Whiting's slides, most of them taken in her own garden with her own color camera. I am happy to introduce Mrs. C. G. Whiting, who will discuss her "Garden Records in Color". Mrs. Whit - ing. A very interesting lecture with illustrated slides in natural color was presented. The growing of iris seemed to be her particular hobby and the slides showed many different varieties of this popular flower, both in mass planting and close-ups. Mrs. Whiting paid a splendid tribute to our Nebraska iris growers, the Sass brothers, and showed slides of several varieties of iris which have been developed on their farm. Mrs. Whiting feels that the color camera and its developments which we may expect in the future will add greatly to the enjoyment of every garden lover. Her camera and outfit represented an approxi - mate investment of $100 and the finishing of pictures and preparing of slides amounts to little more than for the ordinary camera. MR. HOPPERT: I want to express the appreciation of the entire group to Mrs. Whiting for the inspiring talk on gardens. It is getting late and I know a great many of you are a long way from home and anxious to get started back so let's get on with the program. Mr. O. S. Bare, Extension Entomologist, has prepared a paper on borers that I'm sure you'll be interested in hearing. During these last few dry years when our shade trees were weakened, borers have added to our trouble. Mr. Bare will explain what borers are most prevalent now and what to do about them. Mr. Bare. TREE-BORING INSECTS WE SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT By 0. S. BARE, Extension Entomologist Nebraska College of Agriculture Introduction of new plants always complicates insect control problems. The new plants may prove to be very susceptible to attack </seg>
         <seg id="p467">Nebraska State Horticulture Society by our native insects, and we also may have introduced new insects that often prove to be very destructive to our native vegetation. Climatic factors affect behavior both of new plants and new insects while introduction of new species, both plant and insect, affects behavior of native species. Thus new problems arise continually. However, the insect that is most troublesome to horticulturists of Nebraska at the present time is a native here. This pest is commonly known as the flat-headed apple-tree borer, although it is just as destructive to many other trees and shrubs as to the apple. In recent years it has grown most rapidly in importance of any of our horticultural pests. This has been due primarily to drouth con - ditions of recent years, but an abundance of trees and shrubs that are highly susceptible to its attack has been a factor in the amazing in - crease. : Many species of trees and shrubs are subject to attack by this pest. Weakened and dying trees are most susceptible. Healthy, vigor - ous trees ordinarily escape attack except under unusually hot and dry conditions of long duration. Newly transplanted trees and those that have been weakened by sunscald, defective pruning, extreme heat and drouth or old age are very likely to fall victims to it. The terrible drouths of 1934 and 1936 killed or greatly weakened many thousands of our trees and shrubs. The summer of 1937 was but little better, and certainly gave no opportunity for weakened trees to recover lost vitality.' Consequently we must expect widespread trouble from this borer in 1938, and indeed until a period of normal rainfall covering several years has given the weakened trees a chance to recover their normal vigor, and the thousands of dead and dying trees now so conspicuous have been cut out and destroyed. The adult of this borer is a flat, metallic gray beetle slightly over a half-inch in length. It appears from May to August and lays its eggs on the bark of trees and shrubs, preferably in direct sunlight, Eggs seldom are laid in well shaded locations. Eggs hatch in a short time, and the newly hatched grubs burrow through the bark and into the cambium layer. They cannot get through the cambium layer of a vigorous tree having a strong sap flow, and the little borers usually perish in such places.! In weakened trees with a weak sap flow, they destroy the cambium layer, often completely girdling and quickly killing the tree or branch. Keeping trees well watered will greatly reduce, but not entirely prevent injury. In dry summers, par - ticularly in times of hot winds, evaporation or. transpiration of mois - ture through the leaves may occur faster than water can be taken in through the roots. Thus, the sap flow is decreased, and even vigorous and well-watered trees may be badly damaged or killed. The borer winters in the tree, but changes in spring to the adult form and soon emerges to lay eggs to produce the next generation. '' </seg>
         <seg id="p468">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture When trees are to be transplanted, the transplanting should be done in the fall or very early in the spring, and water should be supplied plentifully. This enables the tree to become established and growing vigorously before the young borers appear. The trunk and the bases of the lower branches should be protected through at least two summers by wrapping well with some material such as heavy building paper or sisalkraft. Excellent results have been reported by using a spiral wrapping of sisalkraft cut into strips about four inches wide, and allowing each ply to overlap about an inch in wrapping. The wrapping should begin at the soil, and should extend to cover the bases of the lower branches. Providing shade for the trunk and lower branches is helpful, but it is only partly effective in preventing injury. In older trees, those with widespreading branches and open tops that admit a large amount of sunlight are more subject to attack than those having compact, closely trimmed heads and well-shaded trunks. Sunscalded areas and pruning wounds are favorite points of borer attack and all such places should be given a coat of white lead or a good tree paint. Old, badly weakened and heavily infested trees should be cut out and burned before the adults appear in the spring. More vigorous trees that are but lightly infested may often be saved by watering well, cutting out the borers with a sharp knife and then painting the wounds with white lead or tree paint. Various washes and paints that are claimed to possess borer - repelling properties have been tried and recommended by some eastern experiment stations, but none have proved to be dependable under Nebraska conditions. During the summer of 1937, the adult beetles partly or com - pletely defoliated many trees of several species by girdling the leaf stems. A spray of one and a half pounds of lead arsenate, a half - pound of Paris green, and two pounds of hydrated lime in fifty gallons of water proved to be effective in controlling this type of injury. Different species of trees vary greatly in susceptibility to attack by this borer. American elm, soft maple, and apple are subject to very heavy attack. Most fruit trees and many shade trees are at - tacked to a more or less serious extent. However, a considerable number of shade trees and ornamentals appear to be quite resistant or even immune to its attack. European or English elm, Chinese elm, hackberry, honey locust, bur oak, green ash, and basswood are seldom damaged seriously, and none of the evergreens are attacked by this particular borer. These facts should be considered when new plantings are to be made. </seg>
         <seg id="p469">Nebraska State Horticulture Society Several other wood borers, both of.the flat-headed and round - headed species attack our trees, but none approach the flat-headed apple tree borer in widespread destructiveness. Most of them attack only one or two closely related species of trees, and thus do not possess potentialities for causing such widespread damage. Among these lesser borers may be mentioned the elm borer, the black locust borer, the ash borer, and the cottonwood borer. All of these are similar in that they attack very largely old, dying, or badly weakened trees. Aa a general rule, we may say that most effective control can be secured by keeping the trees well watered and growing vigorously, cutting out and burning dead, dying, or badly infested trees or branches and, where trees are only lightly infested, cutting out and destroying the borers or injecting into the burrows a small amount of carbon bisulphide, after whch the burrow should be sealed with wet clay to confine the fumes. '• . 7 ¦ .-'•!'"¦'¦:' WEDNESDAY, December Bth, Forenoon Plant Industry Building Vegetable Growers Meeting MR. HOPPERT: Perhaps we had better get started with our meeting. Mr. Wert Breck of Waverly was to have been the first on the program with a talk on "The Vegetable Grower has his Prob - lems" but for some reason, Mr. Breck hasn't showed up. Probably couldn't get his car started. We changed the dates of Organized Agri - culture to get better weather but we didn't consult the weather man. Since Mr. Breck isn't here, we will go on to the next number on our program, Ollie Stevenson's story of how they did what couldn't be done. It is commonly thought that pea growing is a northern in - dustry but Ollie is one of these individuals who tries things out for himself. 1 am sure you will enjoy the story he has to tell about pea growing in eastern Nebraska and western lowa. I am glad to introduce Mr. Oliver 'Stevenson of the Otoe Canning Company of Nebraska City, whose subject is "Our Experiences in Growing and Canning Peas". MR. STEVENSON: Mr. Chairman and fellow Nebraskans. It is indeed interesting to have our friend, Mr. Hoppert, who was raised in Wisconsin, admit that he is one of those who rather felt that the project could not be undertaken successfully in the Missouri valley. You note from the program for this hour the subject we have is our experience in growing and canning peas. This is an industry of long standing in this country, haying been initiated at or near Balti - more in the decade before the Civil war. The.industry made rapid expansion with the introduction of machinery for the harvesting and separation or hulling of the peas. The industry at this time has </seg>
         <seg id="p470">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture attained a volume of 23,500,000 cases of No. 2 dozen cans of peas from 452,620 acres. The growing and canning of peas was not undertaken in the Missouri river valley until the year of 1933, when the Norfolk Canning Co. and the Otoe Food Products Co. made some experimental 'plant - ings and installed some pea viners for the hulling of the trial [plant - ing. It had been generally considered this area was too far south and weather conditions too changeable with high flashes of temperature at harvest time which is conducive to ripening of the peas too rapidly causing the production of a product of inferior quality. The trials seemed to justify sufficient optimism to launch the industry on a com - mercial basis. The production of peas can only be successful permanently by following a proper crop rotation system. While this applies largely to all farm crops, it applies most strongly to peas. Chief among the reasons for this need are susceptibility of the pea plant to disease and insect pests, weeds thrive after peas because the soil is left in favorable condition for their grown. Disease is probably the most important factor. Pea blight and root rot are hard to combat once they have become established. In some of the older producing areas, badly infested pea fields have been found to harbor the germs of rot for many years. The disease is intensified by successive cropping to peas. It is interesting, however, to know through the efforts of men like Dr. H. O. Werner, Dr. Goss and others, resistant strains are being developed. The value of rotation for the control of insect pests and diseases cannot be too strongly presented. A good rotation is to follow peas with corn, as peas are a legume. Clovers and wheat also make a good rotation as wheat makes it possible to fall plow which is advisable and almost imperative for high production of the best quality of peas. It has been found that the use of lime on land planted to peas, even though analysis of the soil did not indicate presence of acid, has shown a decided increase in the production of shelled peas over other land not so treated. The character of the soil is noticeably improved by the addition of lime. It remains loose, loamy and does not compact in wet weather by the movement of loaded trucks or wagons over it. Good, well drained, level or uniform sloping land is the first essential to be given consideration when undertaking the growing of this crop. A uniform slope to the land is very necessary as maturity of peas is naturally affected by a few degrees of slope to the south or north. Peas of uniform maturity cannot be harvested in fields that are not level or uniform in slope. Heavy, black soil retains a higher percentage of moisture which is essential. This type of soil also requires a higher percentage of </seg>
         <seg id="p471">Nebraska State Horticulture Society organic matter. Loess soils and sandy loams are better suited to the growing of peas as these types provide for better harvesting conditions than do the heavy soils if wet weather is encountered at harvest time. These types of soil produce higher tonnage of peas than do either the heavy or sandy types of soil. Fall plowing of land is always advisable particularly with heavy soils which are low in organic matter. __. Fair results are often obtained with very early spring plowing. When spring plowing is done, care should be given to carefully firming the soil by discing, the use of land rollers, dragging and floating with heavy drags. Floating the land to a level and unform surface is highly important. Such preparation makes it possible to plant the seed to a uniform depth. This insures, uniform development of the pods and eliminates fowling of the cutting.bars at harvest time. Peas need a deep well prepared seed bed. The soil should be worked at least five inches in depth. High quality seed is of the great - est importance, too much stress cannot be placed on procuring- the best seed obtainable. _..'¦..- Innoculation of pea seed is important. Peas are a legume and are aided by bacteria which may be absent. This is particularly true when organic matter is low. We have observed fields where growth of varied vigor was decidedly evident. Some plants were large and vigorous, while others within a short distance were less vigorous and upon close jexamination it was found all vigorous plants had large and numerous nodules on the root system while less vigorous had no nodule development. Upon further examination to determine the cause of this condition, it was found organic matter was absent where the less vigorous plants were growing. In fields where inocula - tion was practiced, the vine growth was more uniform in growth and had a deeper green color due to greater root development and the making of nitrogen Of the soil more available during early wet, cool growing -..' | ..'¦. '¦-¦'.- -.-.':-' ¦ Yields are substantially increased. Percentage of smaller sized peas were increased. Peas are higher in protein content.

         <seg id="p472">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture into hot dry weather which often prevails in June and early July. Hot weather brings about a condition worse with this crop than any har - vesting experience you have ever had. Peas should be sown at uniform depths of three to four inches if they are to germinate, grow and ripen evenly. Uniform seeding requires that the ground be level and well tilled to a uniform depth. The grain disc drill is best for seeding since it covers all seed to a uniform depth. Care should be given to prevent any skips in planting as this hastens maturity of the plants bordering the open areas and produces some hard peas. After planting it is beneficial to roll the seed bed to firm the earth around the seed and eliminate air pockets which assists in uni - form germination. The rate of seeding is from three to five bushels per acre. It has been found the heavier sowing produces more uni - form peas at harvest. The Alaska peas have proven best suited to growing conditions in the Missouri river valley, but wrinkled varie - ties or sweets are being grown with varied degrees of success. The peas are cut with mowers, either horse drawn or tractor drawn. The pea vines are loaded on hayracks and hauled to the viner station where they are hulled, the peas going into lug boxes thence to the canning company. The vines go onto stacks where it makes a fine ensilage, high in protein but low in carbohydrates. It provides an excellent bulk feed for dairy or feeder cattle. The yields vary in accordance with soil and weather conditions but production of from one to two tons of shelled peas are common and often exceeded. The price for the last four years has averaged about $46.50 per ton. The peas are taken to the factory from the viners as rapidly as possible as they are subject to change in quality when subject to warm air. The peas upon delivery at the factory are cleaned, washed, graded as to size and quality, blanched, run through automatic filling and closing machines, cooked, cooled then placed in the warehouse or distributed to the trade. Marketing conditions are bad on peas at this time for the reason 23,500,000 cases were packed this season with a carry over of 2,800,000 cases making a total of 26,300,000 cases for distribution. The average consumption for this country per annum is 18,653,000 cases. The export amounts to 119,000 cases and the imports are 16,000 cases. From this it can be seen the pea industry is top heavy with an over production. From a grower viewpoint, a number of growers have been selected from the light soil group. There production was an average of </seg>
         <seg id="p473">Nebraska State Horticulture Society 2,425 lbs. per acre, making a gross return of ?56.38 per acre. The seed cost was ?15.62 per acre leaving $40.76 as a return not taking labor and other expenses into account. '..'-' Some growers follow peas with sweet corn, others have planted ninety day corn and have obtained yields of 45 bushels per acre in the same year making a double cropping. When double cropping is practiced, the grower must keep soil fertility in mind as continued double cropping cannot continue to be practiced without replenishing the soils with adequate fertilizers. We. find raising and'canning of peas satisfactory to both grower and canning company, as it provides rotation and an early cash crop and for the canning company it provides another seasonable canning crop which does not interfere with other seasonable activities but provides additional employment for the employees and another line of products which fits in the general canning and distribution system. QUESTION: What varieties do you recommend?. MR.. STEVENSON: The Alaska has been used! very successfully in our section.; We have used the sweets but have hot had as good success with them. :' QUESTION: How many of the growers are actually using lime? ANSWER: We put on quite a campaign and I believe about 25% of them are using it. I have some tests, if you would be in - terested, on the character of the soil, degree of acidity, etc. which give some interesting sidelights.'.-"'.. MR. HOPPERT: Thank you, Ollie, for your interesting and practical discussion of an industry which is rather new to us in Nebraska. '¦ I know you are all interested in seed treatment. There are a number of companies putting out compounds that are supposed to cure everything. Some of them are of some advantage, lam sure, and others are of questionable value. Our next speaker has had considerable experience with seed treatment in various parts of the United States. He comes from the Department of Agriculture in Washington and lam sure will have an interesting story to tell in regard to this. I am sure no one else is in a better position to discuss the subject "Treating Vegetable Seeds to Control Diseases". Dr. R. J. Haskell, Extension Pathologist, of Washington, D.C. DR. HASKELL: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: As Mr. Hoppert has said, there is some question as to how some of these treatments of: seeds will work in this part of the country where the rainfall is deficient at times. Most of the work on seed treatment </seg>
         <seg id="p474">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has been done in the eastern states where they have a moist seed bed for their seeds. I might say that this whole subject is a com - paratively recent one. Some of the developments are quite new and we have not had a chance to test them all over the country as yet. I know you are all interested in growing vegetables and, since you are, you want to grow crops that are free from disease, blight, wilts, rust, etc. and seed treatment is one of the ways in which you can grow healthy plants. However, it is only one of the ways. I like to think of it as a single step in the program. If I were growing vegetables, the first thing would be my varieties. We have types of tomatoes which are resistant to the wilt which is troublesome to so many growers. In growing cabbage, if you have the 'yellows' disease of cabbage in your soil, the thing to do is to get a resistant type of which we have many. Resistance is perhaps nature's way of ridding our plants of these diseases. Plant breeders and plant pathologists have assisted in this matter of selecting resistant varieties. After I had chosen the variety, taking into account resistance, I would select seed from a section of the country which was free from disease, if possible. Examine the plants in the field and be sure of this. Buyers of seed can't do this so the state does it arid we have what is known as "Certified Seed", in the case of potatoes especially. I would also buy from reliable seedsmen, if possible, and from well established firms. Another step in the program is seed treatment. What does seed treatment do? I think of it as seed disinfection. Potatoes may be treated, getting them to sprout earlier, but this is not what we have in mind. We are talking of disinfection of the seed. By that we mean giving them a treatment that will kill the germs that produce diseases. Just as a physician disinfects his hands before an operation, so seed disinfection kills germs on the outside of it. It also disinfects the germs in the soil immediately around the seed after planting. How do we treat the seed? In the first place, I will mention hot water. As we know, live steam kills all germs. We can't use live steam on seeds but we can pasteurize them as we do our milk supply. Of course, we must have correct temperatures or the seed will be injured. The method has been worked out for several kinds of seed: cabbage, cauliflower, for instance, are treated with hot water, 122° F. for 25 minutes. Probably two-thirds of the seed sown in New York state is treated with hot water. Sometimes the seed seller does it and sometimes it is done by the County Agent. A day is set aside when this help will be given and you may take your own seed in and have it treated. Seeds in small amounts might be treated at home by the use of a Thermos jug. Care should be taken that the seeds are dried quickly after treatment. Hot water treatment will </seg>
         <seg id="p475">Nebraska State Horticulture Society take care of black rot, black leg disease of cabbage and cauliflower and alternaria blight of tomatoes. This treatment may also be used on beets, carrots and tomatoes but it is not used as of ten as on cabbage. We will now discuss chemical disinfectants. Corrosive sublimate may be obtained in tablet or powder form at any drug store. Seeds are soaked in this solution for different lengths of time depending upon the kind of seed being treated. Cabbage 20 minutes Cucumber and melon 5 minutes Tomatoes (weaker solution) 5 minutes Potatoes 1% hours. ''¦-.'. This is one of the most effective treatments although it is one of the ; oldest. ¦.: Within the last few years, dry dust treatments have come on the .- market. Perhaps the most common of these is the mercury dust. . Most of these mercury dust treatments are manfactured by the same company, their principal product being "Semesan". This is a white powder arid is used one-half to One-fourth teaspoonful to a pound of seed. It may also be used as a liquid, 1 ounce to 3 gallons of water. Asparagus, peony and such roots may be dipped in this solution. Another group is the copper compounds. They may be used wet or dry also. Red oxide of copper is the same pigment as is used in red paint. It is a good disinfectant for vegetable seeds. You should be sure the material is fresh and keep it in air tight cans. It is used 2 teaspoonsful to a pound of seed. In New York state, this red oxide is very often used on peas. They have trouble getting a stand on account of disease. On old ground, disease tends to accumu - '. ¦' ¦ late- .'.-'-¦• ¦ '..-. You are just starting on a program of pea growing here and :-j your soil is virgin but, after peas have been grown from year to 7, year, the disease accumulates in the soil and makes the growing of peas unprofitable. This seed treatment with red oxide will help. Mr! Stevenson spoke of using a forced feed grain drill for sowing peas. The first time they used this dust treatment on peas in our country, they had trouble getting them through the drill. It is sur - ; prising what a little dust will do in the matter of friction. They ¦j; found, however, that by putting graphite with the red oxide, the 1 seed would slide through the drill without cracking and they could get i; 7 an even distribution. ... . Fifty! thousand pounds of spinach seed were treated in New </seg>

The zinc oxide used in this treatment is the same as you find used on ordinary adhesive tape. This treatment can be used on cabbage as well as other vegetables and is used about the same as the copper. A great many seed dealers are selling their seeds already treated according to requirements. I will show you some samples of the various treatments men - tioned and give a little demonstration with an ordinary fruit jar of how small amounts might be treated. QUESTION: You spoke of an ideal seed bed. Just what did you mean ? MR. HASKELL: A moist seed bed. This is really quite important. QUESTION: I wonder how much of the field corn farther east is treated. MR. HASKELL: In lowa, quite a large percentage of it is treated. During the depression, not so much was done, but it is being taken up again. Dr. Porter of lowa is making experiments with seed treatment and has shown a gain of four bushels to the acre. About the same gain was made in Illinois and it is recommended in Indiana and Minnesota. The northern states seem to be getting more benefit. They had good seed and ideal conditions for early crops. In Nebraska, the results haven't been so striking. The shortage of rainfall might explain part of that. QUESTION: How would you use copper oxide for a wet spray? Can it be put on too strong? MR. HASKELL: Yes, but I can't give you the exact formula right now. Usually some sticker is used with it. It is often used as substitute for the old Bordeaux mixture. It has been used on tobacco plants a great deal with good success, I understand. I would start in a small way with these newer things and find out how it works in your particular locality. QUESTION: I wanted to use it on pepper plants. Would that be advisable ? MR. HASKELL: I would find the exact nature of the disease before I wasted too much time on a spray. MR. HOPPERT: We have all enjoyed this interesting discussion on seed treatment, lam sure. Perhaps, we should digress just a little here The vegetable growers of the state have no state organization. The fruit men and potato men have been organized for a long time. I am </seg>
         <seg id="p477">Nebraska State Horticulture Society wondering whether it would be desirable for the vegetable growers to start an organization. You can be thinking about that during the noon hour. All related groups should be organized in order to have a voice, that can be heard. You have your own problems that are of .:.'...... interest to you and, in talking them over together at a meeting of this type or perhaps a summer meeting, you may come to a better solution of them.

The dues of the Horticultural Society are not large and they include reports of such meetings as this along with many other helpful publications. However, we do not want to insist unless you yourselves feel that you would be benefited. Think it over and we will discuss the matter again. . We will go on with our program. Dr. Werner has had some in - ' teresting experiences with watering vegetables and I am going to call on him now to tell you about "When and How to Irrigate Vege - tables". Dr. Werner. .' DR. H. O. WERNER: We are very conscious now of the shortage of water in growing vegetables. We think this dry cycle will pass but if anyone takes the time to look over the weather records for a period of years, they will be surprised to find that few seasons have an adequate amount of water to grow vegetables properly. THE USE OF WATER IN GROWING VEGETABLES IN NEBRASKA .H.O.WERNER .. Department! of Horticulture '.;': University of Nebraska Shortage of water is the one factor which most generally and most seriously limits yields of vegetable crops throughout the state ! . of Nebraska. To a very similar but less tangible extent this water 77. shortage also impairs the quality of the vegetables. ,| • Drouth periods, during which vegetables suffered more or less seriously, occurred at least two or three times during the last 50 summers at Lincoln (according to U. S7D. A- weather bureau records). Drouth periods are considered as the number of days in excess of 10 days during which the "effective rainfall" was less than half an t inch and rainfall is considered as "effective rainfall" when .50 inch of .: water falls in one day or two consecutive days. These drouth periods i . average from I to 65 days duration, about 60% of them were of more than 10 days duration. In 80% of the years there have been three or more .-.; of these drouth periods. During the last 50 years about one-third of | the total number of days in the growing season (May 1 to September 30) 1 -:-:. !.:';¦;: </seg>
         <seg id="p478">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture . ! have been drouth days. Furthermore these drouth days occur ! more frequently in August, followed by July than in other summer months. It is during this time that moisture requirements of plants 1 are greatest because most plants are at their maximum size and tern- I peratures are high and humidity very low. jf t. According to observations made in conducting experiments the last I twelve years, it seems that a good growth of vegetables such as sweet I corn, potatoes or tomatoes during the middle of the summer will use f one inch of water in 3or 4 days when the mean daily temperature is I around 90° F; in 4-7 days at 80° F; and in about 8-12 days at 70° F. I Thus if the temperature averages 80° For more, from sto 8 inches . of water will be used in a midsummer month by vegetables that are S maintained in a vigorously growing condition. Some vegetables, with relatively small tops, will use less water than others and some will use more extravagantly than others. As the effective rainfall has been inadequate for good vegetable culture during each of these last 12 years, it has been necessary to apply from 6 to 19 inches of irrigation water during the various summers. This irrigation, plus the effective rainfall, brought the total amount of water received by the soil to between 19 and 23 inches during each of the years. (All irrigation water applied was measured by acceptable methods). Soil moisture was quite easily secured at a depth of four feet by tomatoes, sweet potatoes, sweet corn, potatoes, carrots and beets However, when most of the moisture had been removed from the top two feet of soil these vegetables did not grow as vigorously as when there was some available moisture there and plants were more inclined to wilt during hot windy days than when there was some readily available moisture near the surface. Some of the smaller more shallow rooted vegetables as onions and lettuce were able to secure very little moisture below the top foot and practically none from the third foot. On the other hand, asparagus was found to be able to secure moisture at a depth of 8 or 9 feet in the soil at Lincoln and 15 to 20 feet in the loess hill soils near Omaha. Probably be - cause of the limitations of their root systems, onions were found to profit most by frequent one inch irrigations, whereas tomatoes and potatoes seemed to do as well with more infrequent irrigations ol 3 or 4 inches at one time. Asparagus seemed to thrive as well with an annual irrigation that filled the soil to a depth of 7 feet or more as it did with more frequent irrigation. With all vegetables water was always taken from the upper soil layers whenever it was readily available there. In other words, moisture was not removed from great depths if it was available near the surface even though the plant was capable of getting moisture from a considerable depth. </seg>
         <seg id="p479">Nebraska State Horticulture Society All vegetables used much more water when an abundance of soil moisture was available than when it was scarce. While yields were always increased with the judicious use of water, they were not in - creased in proportion to the amount of water added. For example, if the natural effective rainfall during May and June amounted to 2 inches each month, a potato crop of 100 bu. per acre may have been produced. Irrigation of 3 or 4 inches might easily increase the yield 100%, that is, to 200 bu. but an additional 3 or 4 inches might raise the yield only 50 or 60 bushels more to 250 or 260 bushels. Therefore, if only a limited amount of irrigation water is available it will be most wisely used by using it rather sparingly at the most critical time. Whether a number of light irrigations or a few heavy ones will be best will depend upon the nature of the crop, especially upon the nature of the root system. Since it has been found inadvisable to compel plants to extract all the water that they can extract from the soil before applying irrigation; it is desirable to have some idea concerning the length of time that a soil, moist to a certain depth will supply moisture adequately. The top four feet of soil will hold a total of 6 to 8 inches of available water but only 4 to 5 or 6 inches of this is really readily available. This much moisture Is needed in a month by most vegetables when they are approaching their maximum size if tem - perature conditions are moderate. If temperatures are very high it may all he dissipated in two weeks. When the plants wilt seriously or seem to be making rather slow growth they will probably have removed most of the readily available water within reach of their roots. With potatoes this-will be 3or 4 feet. Ha maximum crop or anything approaching it is to be produced, some water will then need to be applied.. As an irrigation of 3 to 4 inches will replace all moisture removed: and as more would only seep beyond the reach of the roots, there is no point in applying more at any one time. Most soils can retain from 1% to 2 inches of available water in each foot of soil. According to our experiments, the equivalent of 12 to 15 inches of water have been removed from the soil by potatoes from May 15 to July 15 when large crops were produced. If at plant emergence time, about May 17, the top 3 feet of soil are filled with moisture to tneir field carrying capacity they will hold from 4% to 6 inches of water. If 12 to 15 inches of water are required to grow a good potato crop, then 8 to 10 inches additional water will need to be available to grow a potato crop of maximum !.-•' yield. If all the "effective rainfall" occurring between May 1 and ! July 15 is retained in the soil, it will not be adequate in many I seasons as the average for the 12 years was only 5.75 inches. (See </seg>
         <seg id="p480">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Table). Of these 12 years there were 8 during which rainfall during either May or June or both was almost totally inadequate for producing a good crop of potatoes and at such a time the temperature was unusually high. In only one year (1931) was the rainfall sufficient in amount and distribution to produce a really good crop without irriga - tion. With tomatoes, that require most of their moisture during July and August, the situation is even more acute. With the very large vine growth and high temperatures occuring we have found that the tomato uses about 10 to 12 inches of water during July and August. The average effective rainfall during these two months in the last 12 years has been only 4.88 inches. In none of the last 12 years has the moisture supply been adequate. In all except two years (1932-1933) the moisture deficit was serious in at least two of the half-month mid - summer periods. Tomato plants will survive severe periods of drouth but the fruit set is seriously impaired, fruits will be very small and rough and are very likely to be seriously damaged by tip end rot. Hence, a constant moisture supply is very essential to tomatoes. Practically all vegetables have been helped a great deal by irri - gation during some years and some during all years. The short cool season crops that are grown in the early spring are least likely to need irrigation but even these will frequently be greatly improved if they can be irrigated during short periods of hot, dry weather that i do occur in May and June. The early crops least likely to need irriga - tion are radishes, leaf lettuce, peas, and green onions. Crops that may not often need it but may be helped greatly are head lettuce, cauli - flower, early cabbage, beets, carrots, spinach, kohlrabi, etc. Early potatoes will almost always need irrigation. Of the crops still growing in July and August, practically all will need irrigation but onions, beans, tomatoes, egg plants, peppers, cucumbers and other vines, summer cabbage, and frequently sweet corn are likely to be most responsive. Sweet potatoes will often benefit by irrigation but they may not need it as desperately as many other crops. Fall crops as Chinese cabbage, late cabbage, squash, turnips, etc. may need irrigation for starting the crop and sometimes to carry the crop satisfactorily during August and September. Irrigation should always be available for celery. Irrigation for freshly seeded or transplanted vegetables may be found extremely desirab.'e in many seasons. Yields of practically all of these crops have been increased 25% in practically every season. In many seasons increases of 40 to 50% are by no means unusual and during recent hot dry years increases of 200 to 500. have not been unusual. In fact, during recent years good crops have been produced with irrigation when crops not irrigated have </seg>
         <seg id="p481">Nebraska State Horticulture Society been complete failures. A notable example of this kind was the sweet corn crop of 6 tons per acre produced in 1937 when the unirrigated sweet corn Was a complete .failure. In applying water it is important to understand a few general principles. First of all, water moves mostly downward in the soil. There is very little lateral movement. Hence, shallow ditches spread over the. surface are better than deep ditches far apart. In heavy soils there is more lateral movement than in lighter soils but water also penetrates more slowly, hence: if using the surface or ditch system of irrigation in heavy soils, run a small stream of water for a long time in a narrow ditch whereas, in a sandy soil it is better to run a fairly large stream in a wide shallow ditch for a rela - tively short time. Secondly, there is nothing to be gained by supplying water beyond the capacity of the upper few feet of soil or beyond the zone into which the roots of the particular crop can pene - trate. In heavy soils it is desirable to apply as much water at one time as the soil can retain and 1 then wait as long as possible until the crop needs water before irrigating again. This is to avoid poor aeration of this soil. Very frequent shallow irrigations are undesirable. Irrigations of less than one inch at one time are practically never to be considered except in getting newly transplanted or seeded_ crops started. ;'.''¦'." In view of the losses suffered without irrigation, it seems that any one growing vegetables,in Nebraska cannot afford to be without some means of irrigation. In the vicinity of Lincoln 10 inches of irriga - tion water seems to be adequate for most crops in most years. About 27 thousand gallons of water are required for an acre inch. If water costs 10c per thousand gallons, the cost is ?2!,70 per acre inch or $27.00 per acre. On a back lot garden of about 1/20 acre the water cost should seldom exceed $2.00 per season. </seg>

         <seg id="p483">Nebraska State Horticulture Society QUESTION: How do you measure the water? DR. WERNER: We used a regular city water meter. We have sometimes used tin cans placed under the irrigation line and meas - ured the depth of water in the cans. One thing which needs to be considered in connection with irrigation and that is that the quality of the product is improved more than the yield is increased by main - taining uniform growing conditions. The flavor is better, root crops are more uniform in shape and frequently much smoother. QUESTION: What success did you have with irrigation of carrots? DR. WERNER: It has worked well. Carrots have quite a deep root system but as long as they have water in the first three inches of soil, they do very well. .. • QUESTION: Isn't your city water colder than ditch water and would that have any effect on crops? DR. WERNER: By the time it runs through shallow veins from Ashland,, it is fairly warm. If it were cold, it would be an advantage. I have i never seen any ill consequences from spraying With cold water. QUESTION: Will overhead irrigation hold blossoms on tomatoes? DR. WERNER: Theoretically it should but I have never seen it do any dependable amount of good. I would depend more on wind protection such as alternating tomatoes with sweet corn or some tall growing crop. In 1934, we had tomatoes on the north slopes but none on the south slopes. MR. HOPPERT: With some plants, there is an advantage in raising the humidity. At the Plumfield Nurseries, the, Black Hills spruce dropped their needles with furrow irrigation and did not with spray irrigation. QUESTION: Does the time of day tomatoes are sprayed have any - thing to do with hurting the bloom? DR. WERNER: I don't believe it would make any difference. I have never seen any evidence of it. The blossoms are receptive for several days. There is some danger with the overhead system in the matter of having the foliage damp for some time and disease enters. Keep your plants in a good growing condition and do not let them suffer from lack of water. Irrigate according to the condition of your plants. QUESTION: Does the extreme heat prevent tomatoes from setting on? •'"/." </seg>
         <seg id="p484">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture DR. WERNER: Yes, indeed. When temperatures are around 100° the blossoms do not fertilize properly. That is the thing we have had these last few seasons. If you would have a period of three or four days cool weather, you might get a set of fruit. Some varieties do better than others but all are affected to some degree. MR. HOPPERT: Dr. Werner has given us many interesting points relating to irrigation of vegetables. Before we adjourn, I want to bring to your attention the "Fun Feed tonight. Tickets may be purchased at Room 201, Agricultural Hall. This concludes our program for this morning but we will look for you all back this afternoon. WEDNESDAY, December Bth, Afternoon Plant Industry Building MR. HOPPERT-. We will try to get started on time this after - noon. Our program is a little more varied than the one this morn - ing. Mr. Hankins, our Extension Horticulturist, will be our first speaker. He has been doing most of his work with the certified seed growers, however, he is not working with them entirely any more. We have had some demonstration plats in the eastern section o_ the state and he will tell us something about these trials. Mr. Has - kell Hankins. POTATO PRODUCTION IN EASTERN NEBRASKA T. H. HANKINS 1 will discuss the topic assigned me from the commercial potato producers viewpoint, but what applies to the commercial producers will also apply to the home gardener. There are approximately two hundred cars of seed potatoes shipped into eastern Nebraska annually. Only about sixty cars are sold to commercial potato growers, so you see that a great number of small patches are planted. The main factors to be taken into consideration when growing potatoes are:— (1) Variety to plant, (2) Quality of seed, ' (3) Disease and insect control, and (4) Moisture. Maybe I should have put the last one first, because the experience we have had the last few years has shown that it is difficult to grow a crop of potatoes without water, but I will discuss them in the order I have them for the sake of convenience. </seg>
         <seg id="p485">! Nebraska State Horticulture Society . Variety. There are about twenty-five varieties of potatoes grown commercially and many more which are grown to some extent. Out of this large number of varieties there are only a few which can be grown profitably here. There is a ' good reason for this condition. Climatic conditions here are very much different than they are in the high altitudes of South America, which is the native habitat of the potato. Most varieties grown to-day are the results of sports or mutations and this has taken place in commercial potato producing regions of this country. From the results of the potato breeding program, that is being conducted here by Dr. Werner, and of several other men in various XParts of the,country, we expect to have a variety much better suited for our conditions but until then it is necessary for us to do the best we. can with what we have. Some potatoes are sold for seed here which results in a waste of money and time. n 77 varkties *at should be grown in eastern Nebraska are Cobbler, Warba, Chippewa, early maturing Triumph, and Early Ohio Dr. Werner will tell you something about these varieties so I will not dwell on them very long, although I would like to point out a few things that should be remembered. . The Cobbler is the best variety to |be grown under most conditions m the section of the state. It withstands heat fairly,well and is not so susceptible to second growth. I The Warba is a good early variety. It will mature two weeks or so ahead of the Cobbler. It should be planted very early because it cannot withstand the extreme heat. Warbas should be dug as soon as they are mature because they are very susceptible to second growth, and sprout quite badly if left in the ground until fall. Th- Chippewa is; a white variety very similar to the Cobbler, this variety does very well when grown under irrigation. . Here are some results of three varieties grown in Merrick and Dakota counties this year: .'""-. i 7 Variety ' 7 Dakota Co. .7, Merrick Co. "¦¦-,„'., Planted Apr. 12 .

I think this difference can be attributed to the date of planting which was about two weeks too late for that county </seg>
         <seg id="p486">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture There is only one safe rule to follow when buying seed potatoes, that is buy state certified seed. I don't mean by that that all non-certified potatoes sold for seed are not good seed. You have no way of telling whether or not they are good for seed purposes. Some dealers make a practice of buying seed from the same growers year after year and in that way they are quite sure of getting good seed. The only time you can detect some of the more serious potato diseases is when the plants are growing in the field. That is why it is impossible to tell whether or not potatoes are suitable for seed by looking at them in a bin or in a sack. Here are some yields obtained this year in three different places. Cobbler Early Ohio Place Minn.

These potatoes were purchased here in Lincoln at one of the seed stores. Seed Treatment: We are often asked if it pays to treat seed pota - toes in eastern Nebraska. It may not pay every year, but it will pay in most years and it is good protection any year. Seed treat - ments will not guarantee you that the crop of potatoes you grow will be free of scab and rhizoctonia but it will assure you that there will be no infection from the seed pieces. Here are some yields produced this year with treated and non - treated seed. Treated with Semesan Bel County Treated Not treated Buffalo 316 300 Dakota 188 164 Merrick 161 140 Average 219" 201 or a gain of 18 bu. per acre for the treatment. 18 bu. x 42£ per bu. = $7.56 or 90c for treating gave ns $6.66. </seg>
         <seg id="p487">Nebraska State Horticulture Society These potatoes came out of the same sack and contained a fairly heavy infection of rhizoctonia as do most northern grown seed. The treatment used was Semesan Bel. That is a very convenient treat - ment to use as it i. an instantaneous dip and requires no special equipment. Moisture ;¦. -Now after we have bought good seed potatoes of the proper variety and treated and planted them, we find that it is neccesary for them to receive some moisture from some source in order to produce a good crop. j-'... Irrigation is the only means we have of being assured that we can get enough water into the soil at the time the plants need it. Of course we know that every one who grows potatoes can not irrigate them. There are other practices which will help such as straw mulching, and directing run of water so that soil where potatoes are to be grown will be well filled with water at planting time. My time prevents me from taking up more problems the potato grower is confronted with, but if you have any questions I will en - deavor to answer them. ; QUESTION: How often would the solution have to strengthened? # MR. HANKINS: It doesn't lose its strength. It is good until all used up, then make a new mixture. QUESTION: How deep should potatoes be planted? MR. HANKINS: We have found three to four inches to be a good depth. QUESTION How many bushels to the acre? j. MR. HANKINS: That depends upon whether the potatoes are irrigated or dry land. Plant more under irrigation. .:.'•' QUESTION: How much dirt do you put over them before the straw mulch? J£R. HANKINS: Perhaps two or three inches; almost as much as if no mulch were being used. :...'•¦.. QUESTION: Has blind cultivaiton proven satisfactory? JIR. HANKINS: Yes, but isn't necessary except to control weeds, however, it won't hurt the potatoes. j QUESTION: I have installed an irrigation pump. Is it possible to over-irrigate?.. ;!'¦¦! </seg>
         <seg id="p488">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR. HANKINS: You can do it all right but it doesn't often happen. It is not a good practice to get the top of the ground soaked. QUESTION-. What time of year would you suggest planting? MR. HANKINS: The last week in March or the first two weeks in April. MR. HOPPERT: If we have no more questions for Mr. Hankins we will go on with our program. The next subject we take up has to do with hotbeds. Mr. Yung of the Engineering Department has been in charge of some comparisons of different sources of heat for hotbeds and he will explain them at this time. Mr. Francis Yung. "ELECTRICITY AND KEROSENE AS SOURCES OF HEAT FOR HOTBEDS" FRANCIS D. YUNG I am here this afternoon to give you a brief report on some experimental work we have carried on in connection with the heating of hotbeds. You may think of a research man as being different somehow from an average human being but I assure you that this is not the case with most of us. I believe the average person likes to find out things for himself and that all of us indulge in a little re - search of some kind now and then. I once heard of a little darky boy who did a bit of research work one day and did it in a hurry. He was standing before a store window looking longingly at a big watermelon displayed there.

         <seg id="p489">Nebraska State Horticulture Society 7 over many of the more common sources of heat for jhotbeds, its use for that purpose has failed to grow as rapidly as it; might have if it had not been for one predominating disadvantage, the cost of electric energy. This disadvantage has been gradually ' lessened by the increased use of electricity and the resulting lowered cost 'per kilowatt hour to the consumer. 7 ¦'¦¦ For a number of years there has been an increasing interest in comparative costs of heating hot beds by means of electricity, kero - sene, and: other type of fuels. It has been difficult to compare the results of the experimental work done because of differences in con - ditions under which tests were made. Here at the Nebraska Experi - ment Station, the work done prior to 1937 will have to be considered preliminary because of variations in test conditions which have occurred. For instance, the control of temperature in the electric hotbed has been by means of a thermostat while that of the kerosene heated beds was controlled manually. In order to obtain definite comparable operating costs for electric and kerosene hotbeds, the problem was approached from a different angle during the 1937 season. For this cooperative project between | the departments of Horticulture and Agricultural Engineering, a total of four 6 ft. x 9 ft. hotbeds had been constructed south of the Horticulture greenhouses. These beds were of the same construction, similarly located, and in all as nearly alike as could be reasonably expected. Two of these are j heated electrically and two of them by means of kerosene. One of the kerosene heated beds is equipped with a simple hot water heating, system; the other is heated by means of a flue. The hot water system consists of a kerosene burner, a water heating coil similar to that used with a range boiler, and pipe for circulating the! hot water through the bed. The hot air system consists of a kerosene burner with a long flue, part of which extends horizontally through the bed a few inches from the . north side. ' The kerosene burners are of the wickless type and are housed in a pit at the west end of each hotbed. Kerosene for the burners is stored in a galvanized iron tank just outside the pit and is fed to the burners by gravity through needle valves. The needle valves are controlled through a mechanical linkage by wafer thermostats located within the hotbeds. Each thermostatic control was adjusted so that the temperature within the bed would not fall below 50" F. •' . The first kerosene burners used were designed for chick brooders. They were of the yellow flame type and were readily adapted to j thermostatic! control. Difficulty was encountered in the use of these burners due to the formation of carbon or spot. The soot accumulated on the coils of the water heater to such an extent that the passage </seg>
         <seg id="p490">Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture was entirely clogged. So much trouble was experienced with this burner that it was replaced by a wickless blue flame type which happened to be available but is no longer being manufactured. This blue flame burner proved satisfactory and the season was finished wtihout further trouble. We are now planning to replace this obsolete burner with a modern blue flame type which can be readily obtained by anyone wishing to set up equipment of this kind. The yellow flame burner in the flue heated bed caused trouble ;'] only once during the season. The accumulation of soot in the flue £ finally clogged it completely necessitating its removal for a thorough cleaning out. When the flue became clogged flue gasses escaped into the hotbed damaging the plants to some extent. Trouble was ex - perienced with fire once during the season. As a result one of the beds was partially destroyed and had to be rebuilt. The electric hotbeds were equipped with soil heating cable and thermostats. Each bed was supplied with two 60 ft. lengths' of '_ number 19 A.W.G. resistance wire covered with insulating material and . a waterproof lead sheath. Each 60 ft. length connected acrbss the .__ usual 110-volt supply has a heating capacity of approximately 400 | watts, making a total of 800 watts for each bed. The extra ¦ length |! of cable was used to provide ample heating capacity for exceptionally 7; severe weather. Common practice is to use one 60 ft. length for a ._ 6 ft. x 6 ft. bed. The thermostat used was of the bulb and bellows type and was adjusted to close the heating circuit when the hotbed ,| temperature dropped to 50 °F. It opened the circuit when the ;. temperature reached approximately 56° F. '._ Since the chief purpose of the experimental work was to deter- i. mine comparative costs of operation, particular attention was given | to keeping the conditions under which the beds were operated alike | for all beds. When the heating unit in one bed was shut off because . of warm weather all were shut off. Extra sash were used part of I the time and again all beds were treated alike. Ventilation in each ® bed was the same. The only variable factor between the hotbeds jp - was the method of heating. Records were kept of fuel used, tern- : g peratures maintained, and other data including weights of plants at I] thinning time and at harvest. ; I '; f The two kerosene heated beds and one electric bed were handled § identically as nearly as possible. The other electric bed was used | as a check on the first electric bed. Preliminary observations were I| also made on this check bed as to the effect of a low baffle which f afforded some protection from north winds and apparently saved a ' f little electric energy. f The beds were planted with cabbage, lettuce, and onions on 7? I ; \ i &gt; i ¦!¦¦¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p491">Nebraska State Horticulture Society February 1, 1937 and were kept in operation until April 20, making a period of 79 days. Plant growth was practically the same in all beds during this period. The results obtained during the 79-day period of operation make an interesting study. The statement that electricity at 2 cents per kilowatt hour compares favorably with' kerosene at 13. cents per gallon for hotbed heating may. sound a bit optimistic but the results obtained during the 1937 season indicate that this is not pore imagina - tion. I realize, of course, that the results of only one year should not be taken for more than an indication. A total of 66.95 gallons of kero - sene were used in the flue heated bed during the 79-day period. The amount of kerosene used for the hot water bed was almost exactly the same, 66.50 gallons. Averaging the ' figures for these two beds, since they were so nearly the same, the fuel used amounted to 0.29 gallons per day per 3 ft. x 6 ft. sash, approximately. :At 13% cents per gallon, the cpst would be 3.9 cents per day per sash. In heating the electric bed for this same period 405 kilowatt hours of electric energy were used. This amounted to l.fl kilowatt hours per day per sash. Remembering that the cost of kerosene was 3.9 cents per day per sash, we can divide 3.9 by 1.71 and obtain 2.28 cents per kilowatt hour as the price of electricity to compare with kerosene at 13 _ cents per gallon. With electricity costing 3 cents per kilowatt hour electric hotbed 'operation would cost 5.13 cents per day per "sash as compared with 3.9 cents for kerosene. Among the other experiment stations that have carried on experi - mental heating of hotbeds the work of Pennsylvania seems to lend itself best to comparison with ours. The work done there during the 1935 season was carried on under conditions quite similar to those existing here in the spring of 1937. At Pennsylvania in 1935 the electric energy consumption per day per sash during a period which was approximately the month of April averaged 2.85 kilowatt hours as compared to 1.71 for the 79-day period during February, March and April at Nebraska. The Pennsylvania flue heated bed consumed 0.215 gallon of kerosene per day per sash as compared with 0,290 gallon per day per sash at Nebraska during the same periods. ¦'. Some of the results in electric hotbed heating at Nebraska and at other experiment stations on a per day per sash basis and under a wide variety of conditions are briefly as follows: Nebraska 1.71 to 2.79 kilowatt hours Kansas 1.21 to 2.91.''.-.-» ! ¦•."-./ Pennsylvania 0.827 to 2.85 " "-..''

         <seg id="p492">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture There are a number of factors affecting the cost of operation of hotbeds which make it difficult to compare our results with those of other experiment stations. Some of these are as follows: (1) Climatic and weather conditions (2) Location of the hotbed with respect to buildings or windbreaks (3) Construction of the hotbed including method of insulating (4) Management of the hotbed throughout the season. Of these factors, that of management is of real importance. One of the decisions which must be made is whether to use manual or thermostatic control. Experimenters do not entirely agree as to the saving effected by the use of a thermostat but it does seem reason - able to believe that thermostatic control should be an advantage since it would tend to prevent heating when heat is not needed and would also be a safeguard against sudden drops in temperature. All seem to agree that the use of extra sash or some type of cover at mght is an important aid in conserving heat. In the case of beds using soil heating cable, the location of the cable is important. ; It has been quite definitely shown that less electricity is used when the cable is placed on the top of the soil than when placed 6 inches below the surface, as is often done. Cabbage, onions, and lettuce plants seem to do well in hotbeds having soil heating cable on the surface of the soil. Perhaps the most important element in the management of the hotbed is that of human nature. There does not seem to be any good substitute for intelligence and painstaking care - fulness. The importance of using extra sash was definitely shown in con - nection with the experimental work carried on here this year. Through - out the month of February the extra sash on all beds were left off entirely during alternate weeks for the purpose of determining the saving made when they were used. In the electric bed during the last 3 weeks of February the temperature inside the bed from 5 o'clock in the afternoon to 8 o'clock the next morning (15 hours) averaged 24 F. lower than outdoor temperature. For the average of these nightly periods our computations show the consumption of electric energy as 4.53 kilowatt hours with the extra sash in place and 9.33 kilowatt hours with the sash off. The saving was 3.80 kilowatt hours per night or a trifle over 40 per cent. In comparing kerosene and electricity as sources of heat for hotbeds a number of advantages and disadvantages of each may be pointed out. Some of the advantages of the electric type are as fol - lows: 1. It is readily adapted to thermostatic control. 2. There is minimum fire hazard. </seg>
         <seg id="p493">Nebraska State Horticulture Society 3. It is exceptionally clean.; 4. There are no fumes or gasses. .-.¦'.: 5. It is easily cared for—little trouble or mussiness. '.:'..'. '6.

It must be near electric service. 2. Electric energy costs are high in some localities. 3. Failure of service may occur. 4. The relations'between electricity and heat are less generally ¦;. understood by the; user. ! Some of the advantages of the kerosene type may be listed as follows:';. . . -j:,: ' ; J ,I.'

Provide a windbreak. i QUESTION: How much air space between the surface of the bed and the sash? MR. YUNG: The sash slopes to the south, about 8 inches high on the south and 14 inches on the north. QUESTION: What was the difference in time of germination beween the hotbed heated with electricity and kerosene? MR. YUNG: The temperatures were so nearly the same that no difference could be noted. MR. STYER (Douglas Co.): I made my bed one foot wider than the frame and tamped this in with cinders. Was yonrs the same? The idea was to conserve beat. MR. YUNG: Yes, we did that. We tried to make average beds, just about as good a hotbed as the average farmer would care to j make. MR. HOPPERT: Thank you, Mr. Yung, for your discussion of hotbeds. I'm sure we all enjoyed it. I am wondering whether you folks discussed the proposition of the vegetable growers affiliating with the Horticulural Society. Do any of you wish to say anything about this? 1 have always felt that the vegetable growers lacked something so far as a state organization was concerned. What do you think about it? MR. STYER: I, for one, suggest that we have such an organiza - tion. I would like to have a meeting like we had last summer here on the campus. As far as I am concerned, it doesn't matter whether we are under the wing of the Horticultural Society or not. i MR. HOPPERT: That doesn't matter to me either. Of course, the I Horticultural Society gets funds from the state for carrying on . their work and this would be to the advantage of the vegetable growers organization. How do some of the rest of you feel about it? MEMBER: I think it would be fine. I believe in organization and it is my personal view that it would be just the thing. .. MR, WIGGANS: Is this a matter of the vegetable growers having their own organization or becoming members and working with the Horticultural Society for the good of all? </seg>
         <seg id="p495">Nebraska State Horticulture Society MR. HOPPERT: It can be handled either way. MR. STYER: I really think we should work together. | MR. HOPPERT: You could have a member of your organization on our board so that your interests would be looked after. If you would like these meetings with general discussion during Organized Agriculture, it could be arranged very easily. You would not have to become members of the Horticulture Society. The florists have their own group because they can't meet at this time of year. QUESTION: Would people anywhere in the state be eligible? MR. HOPPERT: Yes. A program would be arranged for those who are interested. I take it that you are interested and want more meetings, like this so we will see that they continue. I would like to have some of you growers give me your ideas on this and help in the arrangement of the program. We will continue now with the rest of our afternoon program.

During the last year strain tests of Golden Bantum sweet corn from eight commercial sources, and forty-one Golden Bantam hybrids were conducted at Lincoln and Scottsbluff.

The yield of canning corn was 50% greater. The increase in: the yield of canning I corn was greater than of market corn because of the fact that many of the hybrids tested were late, and consequently the damage from smut and ear worm having been greater, the percentage of fresh marketable corn was less than that for canning purposes. Of these forty-one hybrids, some were developed for regions where conditions were very different than in Nebraska.

         <seg id="p497">Nebraska State Horticulture Society from Purdue University and "C" inbred lines from the Agricultural Experiment Station in Connecticut. Unfortunately, we were unable in 1937 to secure seed stocks from certain hybrids developed in the Horticulture Department of the lowa State College. In previous tests we found that some of the hybrids are very desirable. Of these, Purdue x5O by lowa 45 is a good midseason. lowa 13 by lowa 45 is a good late variety. Although hybrid corn does cost more than ordinary sweet corn seed, in view of the fact that the yield increases amount to more than a ton of corn, commercial producers should give very serious considera - tion to the use of hybrid corn., They will get hot only increased yields, but also improved quality. During the coming season, tests of the more desirable hybrids will be conducted on a comprehensive scale and about fifty additional hybrids will be grown for observation. .Tomatoes. During the season of 1937: conditions were very un - favorable for tomato production throughout the eastern part of Nebraska. Excessively hot dry weather seriously interfered with ; proper pollination of the flowers and therefor the plants failed to set fruit. Where irrigation water was not available, the-crop was usually a failure. . .-j ¦. ...'j-- We conducted a series of yield tests in replicated plats of 15 varieties at Lincoln, North Platte and Scottsbluff. The varieties were selected because they were extremely early and because they set fruit well in these hot, dry summers and because they are new-and had not been tested properly in Nebraska. At Lincoln a reasonably good, very early crop was produced. At Scottsbluff considerable difficulty was encountered in securing a uni - form stand because of the serious damage to plants by temperatures just a few degrees above freezing which occurred several j days after the plants had been set out. The growing conditions during July and August were very favorable for tomatoes at both Scottsbluff and North Platte. Highest yields were secured at North Platte and the lowest yields at Lincoln. •¦.-'. .1 -.'• j - . ¦'.-. The- varieties that gave most satisfactory yields of very early tomatoes were the Able, Bison, Red River, ND 209 and ND 216. The latter two produced small vines that had a very heavy crop of fruit. The fruit of ND 215 is large and pink. It is sometimes a little bit rough but frequently very smooth. . Because, of the relatively high yields of large fruits this is a variety well worth trying in the home garden for very early tomatoes in eastern Nebraska, or for main crop tomatoes in the eastern part of the state. It might be desirable for commercial growers to test this variety. The Bison also has small plants and sets a very heavy crop of fruit, which is fairly </seg>
         <seg id="p498">Report op Nebraska State Board op Agriculture smooth. It is very certain in its fruit setting habits. At Scottsbluff it was somewhat disappointing from the standpoint of canning because of the green shoulders at the stem end. The varieties Able and Alacrity which were produced in Canada are very prolific early varie - ties but the fruit is somewhat rough for commercial purposes. The Perm State Earliana gave reasonably good yields but was not as early as the varieties which I have mentioned. It is, however, a dependable variety at all places and the fruit is relatively smooth and uniform. Another variety which is included and which has remarkably uniform, round fruit about an inch and a half to two inches in diameter is the Denmark. T^iis variety sets fruit with considerable certainty and it has some promise, especially so if the size of the fruit can be increased. The June Pink variety gave a very good yield but as usual a very high percentage of the fruit cracked. For that reason, it is a little hazardous to grow for commercial purposes. Among the intermediate varieties there seems to be a little difference in the amount of fruit produced or in the quality of the fruit. Reasonable good results were secured at North Platte with the John Baer, New York State, Chalk's Jewel and Bonny Best. Had the season been a week or ten days longer at Scottsbluff, these varieties would have produced a very heavy crop. At Lincoln they were very unsatisfactory. A number of other varieties were grown and their behavior ob - served. Among these the Pritchard is perhaps the most promising. Onions. Tests with onions included twenty varieties. Highest yields were secured from a selection of Sweet Spanish Onions, developed by the Colorado Experiment Station in Utah. A white Sweet Spanish onion developed by the Utah Experiment Station gave a very excellent crop of round white bulbs. The yield from early Bermuda onions was less than half that from the Sweet Spanish which is sometimes sold commercially under the name Riverside. It therefore seems regrettable that it is this variety that is most extensively used in growing plants which are shipped in from the south. It is very subject to sunburn and pro - duces many double onions. In addition the keeping quality is very poor. The Sweet Spanish onions outyielded all of the American varie - ties such as Danvers and the Southport Globe varieties. In addition to these variety tests, a number of inbred lines were grown from seed supplied by Dr. H. A. Jones of the U. S. Depart - ment of Agriculture. Some of these inbred lines produced excellent bulbs. Selections are being made and it is expected that some breeding work can be started for the purpose of producing varieties of onions more suitable for Nebraska. </seg>
         <seg id="p499">Nebraska State Horticulture Society The Early Grano is a relatively new variety in this part of the country and develops good solid bulbs by the latter part of July. In fact, the bulbs are almost entirely mature by that time. It seems to be the most satisfactory early variety now available. ¦¦•(¦-.. ¦•'';'¦ One of the most serious problems now confronting Nebraska onion producers is the control of thrips. The development of j a resistant variety seems to be the most promising approach to this problem. Thus far the Sweet Spanish varieties seem to be the most resistant. '; Potatoes. During the past several summers strain tests: of all ofi the known, early commercial varieties of potatoes were conducted at Lincoln, North Platte and Scottsbluff. At Lincoln the) Warba and the extra early Triumph selection (Nebraska number 12) gave the most satisfactory yields of early potatoes. The second early strain of Triumph (Nebraska number 4) was not nearly as satisfactory. The Irish Cobbler was not quite as early as the Warba but by mid August it produced a greater total yield. The Chippewa did not give satisfactory yields at Lincoln. , At North Platte there was not very much difference between the Warba, Triumph 12 and the Irish Cobbler as far as early yields were concerned. The second strain of Triumph is only reasonably satisfactory. The Chippewa is unsatisfactory as an early variety but gave a very good yield of fine quality tubers by the latter part of August. It should be given further consideration as a late potato in the central part of the state, especially where irri - gation is available. In the western part of the state where tests were conducted under irrigation at Scottsbluff the Triumph and Warba were j very satis - factory for very early use. In that part of the state it has been found very desirable to harvest the Warba potatoes about as soon as the tubers developed marketable size. If left in the ground any longer, they are likely to take on second growth and also seem to become very scabby. For main crop planting the mid season Triumph 22 continued to be very satisfactory. The Irish Cobbler gave a good yield but the tubers were" very rough. . The Chippewa produced a very good crop of good quality tubers and warrants further testing by those who are interested in growing a white variety in that part of the state. The Katahdin was entirely too late I for use at Scottsbluff and North Platte. An extensive planting project has been initiated by the Nebraska Experiment Station for the purpose of developing superior varieties of potatoes for Nebraska conditions. It is hoped that varieties can be produced for eastern Nebraska which will j be more resistant to heat, and for western Nebraska a variety of better quality that can be handled with greater ease than the Triumph Potato and that will, of course, yield well. : !

         <seg id="p500">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture QUESTION: When is the best time to plant potatoes? DR. WERNER: About the first of April, in this part of the state, but by the 10th at the latest. A series of tests showed that for every one-half month delay after the 15th of April, you lose 15% yield. Potatoes being a cool weather crop, they should be in the ground early. QUESTION: Is the Perm State Earlianna available everywhere? DR. WERNER: Yes. I know of two seed dealers here in town that will stock it. QUESTION: Do you find that some seedmen name their varieties a different name? DR. WERNER: Yes, it daes happen especially with the Earlianna, but not much with other varieties. QUESTION: Are most of the hybrid varieties of corn larger than the commercial types such as Golden Bantam? DR. WERNER: Yes, as a rule, much larger and hybrids are very uniform. More than a third of them had at least 75% of their corn on the first date of harvest and could have been cleaned up in three days. Very often they are cleaned up in two pickings. QUESTION: Were any of these grown without irrigation? DR. WERNER: Only one and on that we got no corn, just a few nubbins. QUESTION: Does it pay to use Semesan on this seed? DR. WERNER: 1 am going to ask Dr. Haskell to answer that question. DR. HASKELL: I believe it would give better returns with sweet corn even than it does with field corn. QUESTION: How do these early hybrids compare with other early corn? Would earlier Planting make any difference? DR. WERNER: They are earlier. Earlier planting might make some difference but we take the risk of injury from frost. I would choose a conservative early date. QUESTION: What strain of celery would be advisable to grow for home use? DR. WERNER: I believe I would stick to early varieties. Easy Blanching and Self Blanching. We have had so many unsatisfactory experiences with celery that we are pretty much discouraged with it. </seg>
         <seg id="p501">Nebraska State Horticulture Society; j QUESTION: Will these experiments with hybrid sweet corn be continued next year? DR.

Oh, yes, it is grown extensively. jMR.

It is hard for me to talk toiyou and I always, have the feeling that it is just as hard for you to!listen,to me and today the problem that I want to talk about and discuss a bit with you is one that has been formulating and developing for a long time. I The problem of the degree of toxicity of lead and arsenic occur - ing inj the form of spray residues on fruits and vegetables has long been a troublesome one. Fruit and vegetable growers are obliged to use! lead arsenate sprays to guard their crops against insect pests. Such sprays are useless unless they are sufficiently poisonous to" destroy the insects. The residues remaining, if in sufficient quantity, are also dangerous to. consumers. There is no difference of opinion among! scientists as to the j poisonous character of both lead and arsenic. Lead and arsenic: are both recognized by toxicologists as cumulative poisons. .In the quantity ordinarily found on fruits and vegetables, the effect of these poisons is not usually acute in char - acter. 'Their danger lies in the chronic cumulative effect when taken into the system in even the smallest amounts over long periods of time. Authorities differ only upon the amounts of these poisons which may bie consumed without damage to health ¦¦ ;..\.¦:)." . . ¦'•'.'•¦ .'The Nebraska State Department of Agriculture and Inspection has; for a number of ' years j been carrying on a cooperative cam - paign with the Federal Food &amp; Drug Administration on apples, that are or have been shipped; inter-state, to remove from the market consignments of fruits and vegetables bearing what are considered dangerous amounts of poisonous residue, :¦['.¦' ¦ '-: ¦¦' '¦'-""-"'.

Director. | * + + The present tolerances were adopted on the basis of advice given by a committee of nationally known toxicologists called together for con - sultation about ten years ago. That committee, in recommending the ! tentative tolerances which are essentially those now in effect, recom - mended further researches designed to fill out some of the gaps in scientific knowledge on the subject and determine more conclusively than had heretofore been possible at what figure permanent tolerances for lead and arsenic should be set to guarantee public health protection. The tolerance that is in force and effect at the present time is lead .018 grains per pound of fruit and arsenic .010 grains per pound of fruit. Last fall it was felt that our work should be of such a nature that the entire fruit growing section of our state should be served in this regard. Our first work was done about the first week in October this year. Two Inspectors, one a Federal man and one a State man, made a trip through the south-eastern part of our State attempting to contact all of the growers that might have a supply of apples sufficiently large that they would have apples for sale. This sampling was done under the head of "Orchard Samples" and in the greater number of cases the samples were taken directly from the trees them - selves. The samples consisted of about twenty apples of each variety that was sampled. The samples were then submitted to the laboratory for chemical analysis and reports were sent back to our growers. The </seg>
         <seg id="p505">Nebraska State Horticulture Society results of this first group of samples showed that a great many apples would have to be cleaned before they could be sold to the public. A copy of the. analysis, together with a copy of our original letter, was sent to each grower. You [might be interested to know that 53 samples were picked up and that over 50% of these samples were high in spray residue. We found that the farther south the samples were taken the greater number of samples were found that did not comply with the tolerance that had been adopted by the Department. Knowing! that mature apples can be washed satisfactorily with dilute hydrochloric acid under commercial conditions without serious injury to the fruit, if certain precautions are taken,-the next trip through the orchard territory was made at the beginning of the harvest. I had the pleasure of being on this trip. We called on all the producers that had had samples that, had shown a high spray residue the first trip and a few growers that we had missed the first trip. It was' gratifying to know and see that the apple growers of our state were taking every precaution to have their fruit cleaned properly before marketing same. -!•,: .. ¦ .---..- ' " • '". ¦ On this trip 33 samples were picked up and over 80 percent of them were within the tolerance adopted. Those that were still high were sent a report at once and cooperated with us. We did not find a single sample running high from the territory that had been worked. We did later,, however, find a shipment out of Superior that was high. This shipment was cleaned before being sold. Altogether 148 samples were run this year and we feel that the results have been all that we can ask. No doubt you would be interested in some results .that we tried to collect relating to spray and residue. </seg>

         <seg id="p508">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Meeting open to discussion. D. BAKER: Do you find that the samples vary quite a bit even from the same orchard? MR. WILLARD: Of course. The samples taken early before Che apple was off the tree was not a fair sample. If the -wind is in a certain direction or the boys spraying are in a hurry, the tree might not be evenly covered. Another thing, we found where one type of apple had a late spray or a Delicious tree was sprayed over again, these apples had to have an extra cleaning. D. BAKER: Do you suppose if we had had the average amount of rainfall that many of the apples would have run over the limit? MR. WILLARD: I question it. This year, of course, there are orchards that had a late spray and then there was no rain after - ward at all. MR. SHUBERT: What did your Department find in our orchard? MR. WILLARD: Your apples were well within the limit after they were washed and that is the reason why you were not notified. MR. HOPPERT: I believe it would be of considerable help if you could get samples of Jonathan, Grimes, King David, and Deli - cious about two weeks before they were harvested, say about Sep - tember Ist. If you could notify the various orchardsmen what amount of residue their samples contained, the various individuals could regu - late their operations accordingly. Most of them wouldn't wash unless it were necessary for it doesn't leave as nice a finish on the apples as does wiping. The later varieties like Gano, York, Missouri Pippin, Winesap and Black Twig shouldn't be examined until about the first of October. There is little or no spraying done in September to add to the spray residue; in fact, any rains that come in September would decrease the residue from earlier spraying, so that the samples taken September Ist wouldn't mean a great deal. MR. WILLARD: Here's the thing. We can take samples of the early apples just before they are picked and then when we go back to check, we can take samples of the others. That would work out just fine. MR. FRANK SIM: What are you going to do with the small orchard men who can't afford to buy an expensive washing machine? MR. WILLARD: That is a problem. If apples are high in spray residue, they have to be cleaned and it might pay a grower to contact </seg>
         <seg id="p509">Nebraska State Horticulture Society a man who has a machine in his neighborhood and make arrange - ments with him to wash them. I don't believe it would cost oyer 3c a bushel." MRS. C. A. LORD: I paid 10c a bushel to have my apples both washed, and packed. , MR. SIM: Transportation charges from one orchard [to another is not a small item and sometimes the grower's washing machine is busy with his own crop. D. BAKER: What is the amount of lead that the human body will accumulate? You said the apples with too much spray residue might be injurious to health. MR. WILLARD: It is felt that apples with no more than .018 grains per pound would not cause trouble. The human body can handle up to a-certain amount, varying with individuals of course, and when that amount is increased the body does not seem to be able to eliminate the excess. This excess accumulates and causes various injuries to the human body. There is little or no danger from occasionally eating an apple with excessive residue. MR. KIMMEL: Why, in making the test, do you take the blossom and stem end of the apple? That part is not used but is usually thrown, away. MR. WILLARD: You.are correct in saying it is usually thrown away but children are inclined to start at the top of an apple and eat right through it. • DEARLE BAKER: If there are ho other questions, we will go right along 1 with our program. I believe that out of courtesy to Mr. Willard I should give my speech at this time. He has been very kind in his remarks on the spray residue problem. I am only sorry that, some more of the gzWers could not have been here this morning and taken part in this discussion. I know that there is quite a little feeling developing around Falls City and Shubert. regarding the testing that was done by | the Department and I was hoping those growers would be here this morning to listen to Mr. Willard's talk. My talk also falls along the line of this problem. PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS Ladies and IGentlemen: i. Following an old custom it is my privilege to give the President's address. What should I talk about? The work that the Society has accomplished or should accomplish? I don't feel that I should. You will hear those things from (the Secretary's report. ..'.'.- It seems to me that I should point out a few conditions that exist which effect the members of this society and perhaps some- </seg>
         <seg id="p510">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture thing can be done about them; either by the cooperation of individuals or the sponsorship of the society. Naturally being an apple grower, I would be expected to say something about the apple industry. I realize that the Garden clubs have problems, the Vegetable Growers have their problems, but being a part of a National industry and knowing the need of in - tersectional cooperation among apple producing sections, I will direct my thoughts and statements along the lines of apple growing, apple packing and apple marketing problems as I see them. My first thought, "Can the Nebraska apple grower continue in business under present growing conditions?" Next, "Can he continue in business under present packing and grading policies?" Also, "Can he continue to market his crop under the present system of outlets, and compete with the low grade apples coming into the state?" Some of you growers will say Yes, but I know we can not under the present policies and something must be done to change them. What can we do to change these conditions? If I may suggest the following or point out some causes, understand I do it in hopes that some good may come of it that will be of benefit to the industry. The apple trees of Southeastern Nebraska are thirsty, and hungry. Why? The rainfall for the past five years has been below normal, the snow fall has been very light and dry. We have failed to provide sufficient plant food to keep a balanced tree, for the lack of funds, due to small, and unprofitable crops. The orchard practices of old, when nature was good to us and provided the necessary things to grow good trees and good crops, won't work during years of drouth. We should ask for and expect full assistance of our extension and Horticultural Department here at the college in working out new growing practices under the present growing conditions. It may mean a complete analysis of each orchard, taking moisture and soil tests, personal inspection to deter - mine a program worked out over a few years, within the cost means of the grower, that would develop a paying orchard. We can not expect results from frequent visits and bulletins quoting experimental work of other states. We need full time assist - ance of one man from the Extension department. We are entitled to it and should expect it. Have we asked for such service? Some growers have and received it. Nevertheless a definite program for the purpose of correcting and advancing the present growing policies </seg>
         <seg id="p511">Nebraska State Horticulture Society "-- "'¦" ¦'-"¦'.' ''•'"¦¦ J-- 7 "-¦,- V 7. 7:'••"-¦.' is needed. Individual spray. programs for each orchard, friendly cooperation between growers, frequent meetings under the direction of the extension horticulturist, would surely be a progressive step and would help develop a fruit producing section worth while. -..-¦¦¦ '&#132;|- .•¦-'.'- '. I am convinced that we can get such assistance if we ask for it. Take the present packing and grading policies, what are they? Every grower is trying to establish his own grade for the whole - saler outlet, the grade for the truck wholesaler, the grade for the small truck peddler, and the grade for the drive in consumer, also the grower wants to sell to the 25 cents bushel buyer. Can we ever expect to build a good demand for. Nebraska apples under this policy? Shall we sit back and permit other sections to come in, take the' market and put as out of business just, because we want to establish our own particular grade? Can we afford to grow and sell 25 cents per bushel grades? Can we continue to be suspecting that our neighbors are going to take advantage of us and undersell us? You know and so do I that this very thing is happening at this time. Surely apples of the same variety and grade are of equal value regardless of who grew them. Can we stop it? Certainly and easily, by passing a uniform grade law and seeing that it contains provisions to eliminate some of the faults now existing. The Horticultural Society sponsored Legislative Bill No. 96 in the last legislature, after two years of work of selecting the good parts of several state laws, and after w. held hearings with several groups of growers, the bill was introduced. Since the word "clean" wa3 used in defining part of the requirements on the different grades, the bill was defeated by several growers, who were afraid they would be required to purchase cleaning equipment. However, we all learned later, that even tho we had no definite law requiring us to clean our fruit, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Division, took samples of apples grown in the state. Those 1.-found having lead residue over the Federal tolerance were con - demned and the growers instructed to clean the fruit before selling. So nothing was gained by objecting to the proposed grade law as far as the meaning of "Clean; Fruit," The publicity given the Nebraska apple grower by the actions of the Federal and State inspectors had very bad effect on the con - sumer, who didn't want your fruit unless you could show test re - ports that your apples were free from residue and would pass in - spection. This condition made al perfect set up for the peddler with junk apples hauled into this statei His sales talk was, "My apples are clean, if not I couldn't haul them across the state line." Perhaps </seg>
         <seg id="p512">Report of Nebraska State Board of Acriculture there were inspectors at the state line. I don't think so. I know the Federal inspector was too busy telling the State inspectors what to do to the Nebraska grower. After the inspectors made visits around the state checking up the merchants and stopping the peddler taking samples of their apples, if they were Nebraska apples, leaving the impression that Nebraska apples were over the tolerance and could not be sold unless they were cleaned. What happened? It slowed up the selling of our fruit because the buyers were afraid the fruit would be seized. The price started down due to the fact that we were not selling and needed the room. The buyers soon found out these things, and would spend an entire day shopping around for his load. In Omaha it was even worse. At the suggestion of the Federal inspector, Dr. F. H. Kinyoun the Health commissioner on Sept. 29th, 1937 mailed all apple growers in the state a letter stating that their apples showed an excessive spray residue. If offered for sale or. stored in the City they would be seized as being unfit for human' consumption. You will recall the Federal and State inspectors made several visits to our orchards and packing plants. They usually came rushing in acting as if you were wanted for some crime or that you were about to commit a crime, grabbing sacks of this and that kind of apple, mostly the smaller ones. Telling you what you could do and not do, something that was entirely strange to most growers. Frighten - ing the buyers who were around to purchase a few bushel for their own use, until the children who were with their parents would ask if the apples had poison on them and they couldn't eat them. These things happened from early fall until October 18th. On that date I visited Omaha, calling on Mr. Hyson, president of Omaha Cold Storage, who only had two carloads of apples in storage at that time, also called on Mr. Charles Gardner and Mr. Ellis with the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, after telling them my story about the interference regarding residue, they made arrangements with Dr. Kinyoun for a hearing. I told Dr. Kinyoun that the publicity his letter had given the apple growers was very detrimental to the industry and we were trying to stop it. He admitted they had been following the suggestions of the Fed - eral inspector. He assured me that the city inspectors would be more lenient if a sample happened to be over a small amount of residue. He signed a letter to the effect that apples stored in Omaha would not be subject to city inspection. </seg>
         <seg id="p513">Nebraska State Horticulture Society . I also asked Mr.W.B. Banning to ask the Attorney General's office on beha,f of the society, for an opinion giving. the sections of law that required the cleaning ;of apples so they would meet the Federal tolerance. We have this opinion giving the sections of law whereby the Food and Drug division made their rules to back up their inspections.. The law is not definite enough and I don't believe workable. We need specific rules and regulations 7 covering residue tolerance. . .:¦¦.; About the present marketing outlets/some growers thought the itinerant Merchants law would be of some help in disposing of our crop and m keeping low grade apples out of the state.' This is .not true, the law benefited the large operators of trucks, hauling one commodity out. of the state and loading on low grade apples in the bottom of his truck covering with canvas and putting a better grade on top.. In this manner he was able to get past the ports of entry if they thought he needed inspecting, he would be asked for a certificate of grade and washing. These certificates could be secured by the dozen regardless of the kind of apples you might be hauling. these operators went into the towns and by selling the combi - nation of the two grades for around 40 and 50c per bushel supplied the demand that belonged to the Nebraska grower. If stopped by a state inspector, and he had his itinerant license, he was permitted to continue operations. 7 This law put the fanner trucker out of business, who in the past would come down into the apple district and buy apples to take bacV into his neighborhood to sell. The grower lost this outlet and found himself with a lot of apples that used to be sold in this manner. The wholesaler wouldn't handle this grade because his outlets were being supplied with; the trucked in 40 and 50 cent grades.

         <seg id="p514">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The government crop reports also assisted in reducing the prices. Each report that came out from Washington from the would be Seers or Prophets, would tell of the large crop and how the market would go down and prices be cheaper. This had a wonderful effect on the consumer, he made up his mind he would wait awhile for these cheap prices. Then along came more reports about the export demand stopping and the large surpluses in the different states. Demand and prices started down as if on a toboggan and haven't reached bottom as yet. Why should this kind of publicity come out from the U. S. Department of Agriculture? Let us discourage this practice. I believe you will agree with me that something must be done to overcome some of the bad things that are interfering with our present marketing policies that results in low prices. It may be the most effective way to solve this by legislation to keep low grade fruit out of interstate commerce except when hauled to by-products factories. Encourage cooperative marketing and advertising. We know the success of the National Apple Weeks as put over by the National Chain Store organizations. I wonder how many Nebraska growers would be willing to assist with such a movement? Are we to climb out of the rut or be pushed off the map? Surely our Horticultural Society can point the way to the solution and correction of our troubles. Why not revise and pass our grade law, this law contains all of the protection we need to keep out undesirable fruit from entering our state. New York State passed a law which went into effect June Ist past, whereby fruits and vegetables shipped into the state shall be marked as to grade or classification to conform with U. S. grades. The law applies to open or closed packages. Several other states such as Colorado, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin have similar laws. Why not Nebraska ? lam sure it would be a progressive move. MR. WILLARD: I think you cut your own throats when you killed your grading law. Those little apples came in because there was no grade law. If there had been, the problem would have been solved. D. BAKER: The men here in this room agree with you, I am sure, but the men who opposed it and also the men who opposed your work this fall are not here. MR. WILLARD: I am sorry if the wrong attitude and ideas were given on those inspections.

Spraying is one of the major operations in apple growing. It en - tails considerable expense for equipment and materials. From late April thru August it occupies a good share of the orchardist's time and constitutes his major item of; expense. It is an operation that changes with the seasons, because no two seasons are exactly alike so far as temperature, rainfall and humidity are concerned and these in turn affect the prevalence and spread of insects and fungus diseases. And now the Federal and State rulings with regard to spray residue complicate the situation still further. Is it any wonder then that orchard men like Frank Shubert, Grover Porter, Bill Banning, have grown gray? If through these talks and discussions the fog i-j lifted somewhat so that you can see a little more clearly the course to follow in your operations for the coming year, I feel that the time and effort that have been put into them will have been worth while. The subject assigned to me is "Adjusting the Spray Schedule to Prevent Excessive Residues", but you will pardon me I'm sure if I. start at the beginning of the spray season and carry the spray program through the entire season instead of starting at the middle. Prebloom spray. In the southeastern counties there is enough </seg>
         <seg id="p516">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture damage done in most seasons by scab, frog eye or black rot, spring canker worms and curculio to warrant a prebloom spray. I am aware that a number of successful growers have omitted this spray during the last few years without incurring serious losses but some of you weren't so lucky. There was enough scab in most orchards in this region to provide inoculating material aplenty for a serious outbreak of scab if we have a cool wet spring. Of course if you are sure it is going to be dry until after the petals fall, a considerable saving might be made by omitting this spray. It would seem, however, that Nebraska has had its share of dry springs and that we are about due for a lot of rain in late April. Then too, there has been a steady increase in the number of spring canker worms throughout this area and elsewhere in the state. If no spray is applied until the petals fall there may be serious defoliation prior to that time. The materials to use are liquid lime-sulfur 2% gallons and lead arsenate, 2 pounds to .100 gallons of water. There is very little likelihood of spray injury from this amount of lime sulfur this early in the season and it is by far the best fungicide to use while the weather is cool and damp. Petal Fall Spray. Orchardists generally are agreed that the petal fall spray should never be omitted. It is the most important single spray in the entire schedule because if properly done, it guards the apples all season long against the entry of codling moth worms by way of the blossom end. This application is made when three-fourths of the petals have dropped. In a season with an extended blooming period the time of application may be difficult to determine. If bees have been rented they should be removed from the orchard before this spray is applied. In most years there will be a few late blooms on new wood or on weak spurs. The grower should not wait until all of these late blooms lose their petals or it might be too late to properly protect the calyx cups of the earlier blooms. In addition there may be great danger of scab becoming established between the time of the prebloom spray and a delayed petal fall spray because during this time many new leaves have developed that have no pro - tective covering. If this period is unusually long and the weather favorable for scab, it may be advisable to put on an additional lime - sulfur spray while the trees are in bloom, omitting the lead arsenate of course, to save the bees. The material to use depends somewhat on the variety. Grimes, Jonathan, and Golden Delicious are subject to spray burn at this state. Some fungicide should be included, however, because they are somewhat susceptible to scab and Jonathan is especially susceptible to frog eye. It is abvisable, therefore, to use a weaker strength of lime-sulfur than is ordinarily used on Winesap, Delicious, Black Twig, Missouri Pippin. For these latter we generally use 2 gallons to 100. </seg>
         <seg id="p517">Nebraska State Horticulture Society for the former 1 to 1% gallons. If the season seems favorable for scab, wettable sulfur may be added at the rate of 3 to 4 pounds per 100 gallons/of spray. Lead arsenate is used in addition at 3 to 4 pounds per 100. .First Cover—Ten Day Spray. Within 10 days after the petal fall spray another application should be made to protect against scab frog-eye, and early hatching worms. In the past we have been guilty of waiting until the bait traps indicated a rather heavy flight of moths. As a result some of the early hatched worms have entered the apples through the unprotected side. The small apples increase in size very rapidly at.this time of the year, therefore, the interval between sprays should be short. Materials. Conditions are becoming more favorable for spray burn as the temperatures rise, particularly if the humidity is also high. Naturally then we must reduce the strength of lime-sulfur or substitute for it wettable sulfur. For scab susceptible varieties like Delicious a combination of the two is warranted. On more re - sistant varieties like Jonathan, wettable sulfur can be used alone There is no assurance that all spray burn will be avoided thereby but the danger is less than with lime sulfur. The amounts of fungicide to use then will vary from 1 to 1% gallons of lime-sulfur per 100 gallons or 4 to 6 pounds of wettable sulfur or a combination of the two forms substituting a pound of wettable sulfur for each quart of lime sulfur omitted. In addition 3 lbs. of lead arsenate are added for each 100 gallons of spray. ¦-¦'• | Second Cover. Within two weeks after the first cover spray another, application should be made. By now the codling moth flight is in full swing and scab conditions are becoming less favorable but frog eye is still dangerous and another fungus, namely Blotch is threatening.varieties like Duchess, Missouri Pippin, Gano and a few others. The choice of a fungicide will depend on the presence or ab - sence of blotch and upon the type of insecticide to be used in the third cover. If blotch is to be controlled or if it is planned to use a summer oil with the lead arsenate in the third cover, then Bordeaux 2-4-50 or some similar copper spray should be the fungicide selected. In the normal season it would be dangerous to use liquid lime sulfur this late in the season. Some brand of wettable sulfur should be used, however, if Bordeaux is not used. Lead Arsenate 3 to 100 is the best insecticide for this application. Hydrated lime may be added at the rate of 4 lbs. to 100 gallons, to help prevent burning in this and previous cover sprays. Third Cover. The third cover spray for the first brood is applied two weeks after the 2nd cover. It is now about June 10th and leaf growth has practically stopped on trees with a crop. Fruit growth is </seg>
         <seg id="p518">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture not as rapid as it was earlier but it is still rapid enough to need additional protection from late hatching worms. The danger from scab and frog eye is generally past but blotch must still be reckoned with on susceptible varieties. Materials. If scab and frog eye are under control the fungicide is omitted on all but blotch susceptible varieties. On Duchess, particularly it would be advisable to use Bordeaux 2-4-50 in this spray. The insecticide to be used depends upon the moth population in the particular orchard. In old heavily infected orchards it may be ad - visable to shift to summer oil as an ovicide (egg killer) and a spreader. If there have been rains prior to this spray most of the residue of former sprays probably has been removed and lead arsenate may be added as a stomach poison and nicotine sulfate may also be added to kill the moths. Summer oils like Verdol, Superla, Orthol-K, etc., can not only not be used with sulfur compounds but they must not be used until the sulphur residues on the leaves have disappeared. In a normal season there should be no danger of injury after 4 weeks have elapsed but in 1934 which was a dry season with unusually low humidity readings, there was considerable burning even a month after the last sulfur spray had been applied. Summer oils are used at the rate of 3 to 4 quarts per 100 gallons. Nicotine sulfate is used at % pint per 100 gallons. If lead arsenate is used in addition only 2 pounds per 100 should be added. If more is used the fruit is likely to have a blotched color at harvest time. In young orchards or in old orchards with a medium to light infestation, lead arsenate 3 pounds to 100 gallons with 4 pounds of lime as a safener is probably the safest and best. There isn't much likelihood of the residue being above the tolerance on late apples in a normal season but on Duchess there is some danger and here Black Leaf 155 could be substituted at the rate of 4 or 5 pounds to 100. Fourth Cover. As a rule 3 cover sprays for the first are suffi - cient but in old orchards or around packing sheds an additional spray is advisable for the codling moth. It should be applied 2 weeks after the 3rd cover. At this time the leaf hopper is about in the proper stage for control measures to be used. This insect has been doing considerable damage in the recent dry seasons, particularly to the foliage on the lower branches of the trees near the ground. Where both pests are serious use nicotine % pint and summer oil 3 quarts per 100 gallons of spray. Two pounds of lead may also be included if washing equipment is available to remove the residue. Where the codling moth alone is serious use lead arsenate 3 lbs. and hydrated lime 4 lbs. in 100 gallons of spray. Five pounds of Black Leaf 155 can be substituted if the residue from previous spray is evident. Second Brood sprays. Excessive residues can generally be attrib- </seg>
         <seg id="p519">Nebraska State Horticulture Society uted to the use of arsenical sprays applied in July and August for protection against the second and third broods of worms. There are several courses open to the apple grower in the event that enforcement of Federal Pure Food and Drug Laws with regard to poisonous residues are continued. 1. He can concentrate his efforts on the first brood applying four or five covers, using spreaders and stickers and very thorough coverage and omitting applications in July and August. Banding the trees with treated bands, thinning off worniy fruits, and picking up early drops and destroying them are additional safety measures ..hat should be employed. In young orchards with a light infestation this method might suffice for two or three years but gradually there 1 would be an increase in the population of moths and in the percentage of wormy apples at harvest time if recent trials of this methocl in Michi - gan and Indiana can be taken as a guide. I 2. He can substitute insecticides of a type that will not leave objectionable residues. Mr. Willard has given you the _sults that some of our Nebraska growers secured with summer oil and Nicotine sulfate during the past season. There are three or four of these oils available on the market that are fairly safe to use at 3-4 quarts per 100 gallons of water. Nicotine sulfate is used at % pint per 100 according to the Michigan results in 1935 (Technical Bulletin No. 154 by J. M. Merritt). This combination gave 0n1y71.8% wormy apples and 4.8 stings as compared with .85% worms and 11.3% stings for lead arsenate. However, since the lasting effect of the oil nicotine combination is less than with the lead arsenate the former was used at about 10 day intervals whereas the latter was used at about 14 day intervals, making 4 oil nicotine sprays for the late worms as against 3 lead arsenate sprays. The big drawback to this sort of a program is the expense. Oh a 40 acre orchard of 18 year old trees for example, the cost of the material alone for four sprays would be about $550 as compared with $122.00 for 3 lead arsenate sprays. Other disadvantages of the oil sprays are that they increase premature dropping on varieties like Jonathan and Mcintosh and interfere somewhat with normal coloring of red varieties. Leaves that have been sprayed with oil show a lower sugar and starch content than normal leaves or those sprayed with lead arsenate and presumably this is the reason for the difference in coloring and premature dropping. Another material that can be substituted for lead arsenate in the late sprays is Black Leaf 155. This material is made by mixing Black leaf 40 with Bentonite Clay. It is not quite as efficient as is lead arsenate in controlling deep entries of worms but slightly more effective in controlling stings. This material does not increase pre - mature dropping of the fruit, in fact it reduces it. Foliage sprayed </seg>
         <seg id="p520">Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture with it retains a deep green foliage. The coloring of the fruit is not as good as where lead arsenate is used, however. The cost of spray - ing with this material when used at its recommended rate of 5 pounds per 100 gallon is almost 3 times as high as when lead arsenate and lime are used. If 4 sprays are used to take the place of 3 lead arse - nate sprays then on 40 acres of orchard the cost of materials would be 3456 as compared with §122 for arsenate of lead and lime ! There is another nicotine compound that shows some promise as a ' lead arsenate substitute, according to Michigan trials. This is called A ico Zxn. When used with oil it gives good control of codling moth reduces premature fruit dropping and leaf dropping but it greatly retards fruit coloring. In conclusion then it looks like, for the present at least, a schedule of lead arsenate and lime is the cheapest and safest considering freedom from worms and good color if the grower is equipped for washing his fruit. The grower who has a wiper might possibly use one lead arsenate lime spray as late as the middle of July but after that he had better turn to oii and nicotine or to Black Leaf 155 The grower who has neither washer nor wiper is taking a chance TOth lead arsenate after July Ist. It might be advisable for him to ! use a calcium arsenate spray in July and then oil and nicotine or I Black Leaf 155. The additional expense incurred when Nicotine com - pounds and oil are used would in 3 or 4 years pay for the cost of a washing machine. A home made washing machine could be built for less than the additional cost where as much as 30 or 40 acres of orchard are concerned. MR. SHUBERT: The same old question. You still think there is no danger of injuring the blossoms with lime-sulphur? I just can't get over being a little afraid of using- it before the bloom is ail gone. MR. HOPPERT: Do you mean that you are afraid of spraying i with lime-sulphur in full bloom for fear of injuring the flowers or the pollen so the blooms won't set fruit? MR. SHUBERT: Yes, that is the thing I'm afraid of. MR. HOPPERT: I never have seen such damage. In fact, Mr Baker here, sprayed in full bloom last spring yet the set was so heavy that about half of the apples should have been thinned off. . ) D. BAKER: Do you think that the trouble with dropping of apples in the Bowers' orchard was because of lime-sulphur spray? Hn, "f HP P™: *°' and ™ tell 5™ why I say that. At one time, Dr. Anchter of the Federal Department of Agriculture tried to j find a spray material that would kill the blooms or prevent th-m from "i </seg>
         <seg id="p521">Nebraska State Horticulture Society setting fruit. They used lime-sulphur at the rate of 1 to 10 and still they had a heavy set. This was on Gano, Jonathan, Ben Davis, and Winesap varieties. MRS. LORD: What caused the tiny spots on the apples this fall? MR., HOPPERT: I think most everybody, had some of those. They are what we call "stings". They are really spots where a worm started to bore into the apple but didn't succeed and the skin healed over leaving a black, sear. The worm eats a little of the poison as it starts into the apple and is killed before it can get it. Sometimes, though, where apples are not sprayed, you find a few of these but if: the spray is effective and you have lots of worms in the orchard, you are bound to have a lot of these apples. . The oil spray kills the eggs or the small worms before they start into the apple thus reducing the number of stings. FRANK SIM: In our last spray, I used lead, nicotine and lime. MR. HOPPERT: No doubt about that being a good spray. The lead arsenate will poison the worms that try to enter the fruit. Many eggs and some young worms are killed the moment the nicotine hits them. Some moths are likewise killed by contact with the liquid. But it would be expensive. We have to figure out how we can do the most good with the least amount of money and play safe on the residue. When the season is cool and damp, a little:spray goes a long Way toward control of the codling moth, but these last few sea - sons we have.had it so,dry that it took lots of spraying. MR. SIM:. Will! nicotine destroy. eggs? MR. HOPPERT; Yes. ; MR. SIM: I don't like to use oil. That reduces the finish on the apple.; MR. HOPPERT: Of course, but there is this about it. As your orchard becomes older, you will not be able to control the codling moth as easily as now. Gradually the population of worms builds up. There hiay be places in the orchard where it would pay to use oil and lead arsenate, particularly near the packing shed. MR. SIM: Do you think a new orchard could have been started in the last few years? : MR. HOPPERT: A few who have tried it have had little success. RICHARD KIMMEL: Where are the worms in the early part of the season? We sprayed the 30th of July. Up until that time we saw practically none but later on, at picking time, we found plenty of them. ! : </seg>
         <seg id="p522">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture MR, HOPPERT: Usually it is a case of being mistaken on how good the control has been. Even though you did examine the fruit pretty carefully I think they were there, particularly in the tops of the trees where the spray coverage is likely to be less thorough. The conditions were very favorable for them during the latter part of the season. D. BAKER: What are the possibilities for a big crop of moths this spring? More than usual? MR. HOPPERT: Not more than usual but a big crop. The sur - vival is generally good in a dry fall. R. KIMMEL: Do you think it would be better to disregard the flig!it of moths and spray at ten-day intervals ? MR. HOPPERT: Where the infestation is heavy that is a good plan. But your orchard is hardly old enough nor infested heavily enough to warrant such a schedule next year. About three sprays for the first brood and one for the second ought to be sufficient in the average year. As the worm population increases perhaps an additional application will be needed for each brood. Then as they become more numerous, use oil with lead arsenate in the last two sprays for the first brood. MRS. LORD: Do you think the brush could be used instead of the washing machine? I have no water at my orchard. MR. HOPPERT: A good brush cleaner will take off 25% of the residue, and if that brings it down within the tolerance, well and good; with a bad infestation you have to use stronger sprays and more of them, and the brushing might not be sufficient. DEARLE BAKER: It is getting near twelve o'clock. Shall we have the secretary's report and get on with our business meeting? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY FOR 1937 The activities of the Horticultural Society for 1937 began with the Annual Meeting in January. As in previous years the sessions were devoted to Fruit Growing and ornamental gardening, one and a half days being devoted to the former subject and one day to the latter. Subjects of timely interest were discussed and published in the an - nual report of the Society. The discussion on marketing apples emphasized the continued need for legislation to bring order out of disorder. The marketing of fruits by truckers is bringing with it problems that were unheard of years ago. The committee appointed by President Kimmel in 1936 to draw up an apple grading bill suitable to Nebraska conditions reported at this meeting. Various provisions </seg>
         <seg id="p523">Nebraska State Horticulture Society were discussed in further detail. The committee was then instructed to carry on and finish the job, namely, have it presented to the growers for their approval or criticisms; have it introduced into the Uni - cameral; support it at the hearings and finally if possible have it acted upon favorably. After the provisions were agreed upon by the Committee, meetings of fruit growers were held at Shubert, Peru, Nebraska City, Florence, Benson and Arlington, at which the Secre - tary explained the provisions of the proposed bill. The only serious criticism of the proposed bill came from Shubert where some of the growers felt that the smaller growers were being discriminated against. A few growers from this same region objected because, they said, the provisions if strictly interpreted would force them to wash their apples to remove spray residue. They testified before the Agricul - tural Committee of the Unicameral that if the bill were passed and enforced it would mean their ruination. Amendments were agreed to exempting growers of 300 bushels or less from the provisions of the bill and reference to residues were also deleted. Then the growers who had opposed the bill signed! a statement saying that they now favored its passage. But the bill was pigeon-holed in the rush of the last two or three weeks of the session and it never saw the light again/together with a lot of others. Perhaps some of these growers have changed: their minds about the need for a grading bill following the harvest and market season of 1937. This subject will be discussed at the session to-morrow morning so there is no need to'spend more time on it now. The Society sponsored a summer tour on August 6th beginning at W. B. Banning's orchard at Union. Mr. Banning showed how the east 20 acres of his orchard were terraced and told of the effect these terraces had on the prevention of runoff and soil erosion. Then j( the visitors drove to the University orchard two miles south to look over the irrigation project that had just been installed on Weeping Water Creek elevating the water from this creek by electric pump through 5 inch iron pipe to the hill upon which the orchard is situated. Professor Brackett explained the workings of the layout and the method of distributing water to the basin around, the tree.. Mr. Roy Mapes, the Superintendent of the Farm had fixed up an exhibit of Wealthies to illustrate the difference in size of fruit from trees under irrigation, straw mulch without irrigation and without either straw mulch or irrigation. Dr. C. C. Wiggans will tell us more about this at the afternoon session today. Then we visited several orchards -around Nebraska City. At Harvey Raben's orchard we saw about 10 acres of' trees that had been basined to prevent runoff, Mr. Kaben reported that these basins were the means of saving practically all the water that fell in a five inch rain early in July. Out of 564 basins made only 16 failed to hold during this rain. Dick Kimmel </seg>
         <seg id="p524">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture had the same experience in about 10 acres of trees at the north side of his orchard. He also uses the basins for irrigation purposes. The group lunched together at the Grand Hotel and after lunch the need for an apple advertising campaign was stressed. Mr. Patterson Bain, fruit grower and former Secretary of the Missouri Horticultural Society discussed the plans of various fruit districts for the coming fall. It was felt that some real hard work was needed to market one of the largest apple crops produced in 20 years. Committees were appointed to sound out the growers in various regions and if possible sell the growers on the idea that united effort would be cheaper and get better results than for each grower to do his own advertising. »i*ii;i_ismsirjsS_^_]y_______:¦_!_¦__¦ . ________________ B'liiimlllilllin .lkJM.i_in____t________________B _fl ___'•¦ Rk_J_ ____ Il '¦ __!_____ m I ________ •_^_^2________^2£Z*____________^_^_vKßß^_^_&amp;__^Eb_________^_B The Rock Garden feature arranse d by Jennings Hagr_ rty at the 1937 State Fair. The consensus of opinion seemed to be that before an advertising campaign could bring results the crop would have to be graded to definite standards. Since Nebraska did not have such compulsory grading, cooperative advertising would be of little value. That is where this matter was left. Then came the State Fair at which the Society sponsored and supervised the fruit, flower and landscape gardening exhibits. The feature apple display depicted King Apple with his crown. A similar display was shown at the Ak-Sar-Ben stock show. Right after the State Fair a meeting of fruit growers was held at Shubert and one at Nebraska City to discuss and demonstrate apple grades.

         <seg id="p528">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture GRASSHOPPERS WILL BE A MENACE IN 1933 By 0. S. BARE, Extension Entomologist Nebraska College of Agricutlure The 1937 fall grasshopper egg survey showed a plentiful supply of grasshopper eggs to be present in all of the Missouri River coun - ties from Washington County south to the Kansas State line. In fact several counties showed an even higher egg count than that which preceded the destructive outbreak of the spring and summer of 1937 Adjacent counties to the west also carried egg infestations ranging from moderate to severe. In view of these conditions, it appears certain that southeastern Nebraska will experience another severe grass - hopper outbreak in 1938 unless weather conditions of the spring and early summer are extremely unfavorable to them. These grasshopper eggs may be expected to begin hatching late in April, and the hatching period normally lasts from six weeks to two months. Hatching occurs largely along roadsides, sod-fence rows, sod edged cutbank and ditches, field tumrows, alfalfa stacks, and some - times in alfalfa fields and both wild and tame grass pastures. Young, wingless grasshoppers can be controlled much more easily than the older winged ones. Poisoning is most effective just before the little grasshoppers leave their hatching grounds and begin spreading through the fields and orchards. This usually occurs when th= young grasshoppers are about two weeks old. In southeastern Nebraska poisoning operations usually should be started between May 10 and May 20, but this may vary ten days or more according to earliness or lateness of the spring. Where only one species of grasshopper is involved, one or two applications of bait should give good control. If more than one species is present in large numbers, three or more applications of bait at ten-day intervals may be required. The really important thing is to check the infestation before the young grass - hoppers become scattered through the crops. Pure bran bait is most effective, but a properly mixed bran and sawdust bait is almost as good and is much cheaper. It also spreads more easily and is less dangerous to livestock and poultry than ,s pure bran bait when spread imperfectly. Sodium arsenite, white arsenic, and Paris green are effective grasshopper poisons. Sodium arsenite is probably the best grasshopper poison known to entomologists, but as it is quite dangerous to handle it usually is recommended for use only at supervised mixing stations. Paris green and white arsenic are recommended for use where home-mixing of bait is to be done. Lead arsenate, calcium arsenate, and epsom salt are not effective as grasshopper poisons. A good grade of amyl acetate is attractive to most grasshoppers, </seg>
         <seg id="p529">Nebraska State Horticulture Society and its use usually adds markedly to the attractiveness and conse - quently to the effectiveness of bait. Molasses in itself is not at - tractive to grasshoppers, but it causes the bait to retain moisture for a longer period and also seems to bind! the odor of the amyl acetate. Consequently, the addition of molasses probably pays well, particularly after hot weather arrives. The addition of a small amount of salt makes the bait more attractive to adult grasshoppers, but seems to have little or no value with the young, wingless ones. Control of grasshoppers in orchards presents some problems not ordinarily encountered when dealing with the pests in ordinary field crops. Orchards in permanent sod or with certain types of cover crops such as sweet clover prove to be very attractive to grass - hoppers at egg-laying time, and so are likely to carry a heavy egg infestation. The shade of orchards also is very attractive to the pests in extremely hot weather, and after the hoppers have located in the trees, poisoning is difficult. ! Weeds and tall grass or tall cover crops, should be kept down, both around and under the trees. Weeds arid tall grasses along the fences furnish a shelter and trap where the grasshoppers can be poisoned quite readily. Where grasshoppers have laid eggs throughout the orchard, a thorough double-disking in late fall or very early iti the spring will reduce the coming hatch as many of the egg pods will be broken up and exposed to the destructive drying action of sun and wind, and the attacks of birds and small animals will destroy considerable numbers of them. However, in very, few cases can it be expected to destroy over a third or a half of them. . When the eggs hatch in the spring, light applications of poison bait should be begun as soon as the little grasshoppers appear in any great numbers.. These should be repeated at ten-day or two - week intervals as long as is necessary. Young grasshoppers eat bait readily and are easily poisoned. By fighting them persistently later damage can be very largely avoided. A few pounds of bait, very thoroughly scattered, is more effective than heavy applications that are not well scattered. Bait scattered, thinly and thoroughly is not dangerous to poultry, birds, and livestock, but poorly scattered bait is dangerous to anything that will eat it. Bait should never be put out in cold damp weather as grasshoppers do not feed under such con - ditions, and bait spread-then is merely wasted. Grasshoppers feed mainly in temperatures between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and only when grasses and weeds are fairly dry. Late in the season, flights of migratory grasshoppers sometimes occur. In such cases, they will alight throughout the orchard, and in hot weather they may go into the trees and stay there both day and night. . Poisoning them is very difficult, but some orchardists have </seg>
         <seg id="p530">Report of Nebraska State Boaed of Agriculture reported good results by using plenty of amyl acetate in the bait and scattering it under the trees, early, on a quiet warm morning. The odor of the amyl acetate evidently is strong enough to attract the grasshoppers from the trees under such conditions. Others have reported fair results by throwing bait into the trees where it lodges to some extent on the foliage. However, this should not be done with baits containing sodium arsenite as it may burn the foliage quite badly. Just remember that early and persistent use of bait will reduce injury by grasshoppers to a very small figure, that a hundred pounds of bait used in May are worth a ton used in July, and that bait scattered thinly and very thoroughly is harmless to anything excepting grasshoppers and crickets. D. BAKER: Is there any formula that a grower could use in his spray machine to spray fence rows and weed patches? MR. BARE: We have found that a strong Paris Green spray will kill grasshoppers but we have not advised this when the poison bran is so much more effective and not as dangerous to use. MEMBER FROM MORRILL COUNTY: We used lead arsenate on beet tops in our county but it had no effect on grasshoppers. MR. BARE: No, that is not a grasshopper poison. You will always get better kills with a prepared bait poison than with a spray. Paris Green is the only thing I would recommend in a spray for grass - hoppers. It will kill a great many but you would kill more with a bait poison than with any spray. QUESTION: Will sodium arsenite burn the plants? MR. BARE: I have seen cases where it damaged the foliage of plants. I would not recommend that for a garden but for field use. The fumes of this material are also poisonous. R. KIMMEL: After grasshoppers get up into apple trees, would it do any good to throw the bait up into the trees or would it damage the foliage? MR. BARE: Yes, it would do some good but poisoning should be done before the grasshoppers get up into the trees. Early poisoning does so much more good. D. BAKER: All of this discussion of grasshoppers sounds as though we growers had another problem to solve. After looking over the program for the balance of the afternoon, it almost seems that somebody anticipated my speech and tried to answer some of the problems outlined in it.

Duley, Federal Research Conservationist, at this time. Dr. Duley. SOME FACTORS AFFECTING SOIL AND MOISTURE CONSERVATION F.L.DULE-. Introduction During the last ten or fifteen years,there has been a great increase in the attention given the very intimate relation between the soil and the plant. These studies have been concerned not only with such plants as the grasses, alfalfa, and other, herbaceous plants, but the relation between the soil and larger plants such as trees and vines has also been considered. It is, of course, common knowledge that a plant derives not only mineral plant food material^ from the soil, but also water and '.:.: possibly even some organic constituents. The ability of the plant to ..-; obtain these necessary substances, however, depends upon the presence of a proper amount of water in the soil within the root zone of the plants since water is the solvent in which the plant food minerals are dissolved. .. .When low moisture conditions exist, the plant is said to suffer from drought. With shallow rooted crops drought conditions often occur in many parts of the United States and the world, even in the so-called humid regions. In the regions of lower rainfall, drought is a much more common phenomenon and is (evident not only on shallow rooted, but deep rooted crops as well—notably crops such as alfalfa, trees and vines. -'. '..-.¦--¦'¦¦.'¦'i - "--'- ¦'. Under low rainfall conditions, we must make use of as great a pro - portion of the rainfall as possible, j It has been shown that water has a higher efficiency when the plants are growing in a fertile soil. The preser - vation of the surface soil along with the water supply is, therefore, a matter of the utmost,importance. The surface dark colored layer of soil may contain froth 2 to 4 times as much nitrogen as the subsurface or subsoil layers.; It is/therefore, important to maintain this surface layer 7,; since it is not only higher in some of the more important plant food elements, but it usually has a more desirable texture and structure. ... - ' Results It will be my purpose in this discussion to call attention to the re - sults of certain experiments which show the effects of some of the ! ordinary conditions of crops and soils on the amount of loss of rainfall water as runoff and the loss of soil by erosion. At the outset it may be .! pointed out that runoff and erosion! are affected by a number of factors :••)'¦" Keprescntative, Division of Research, Soil Conservation Service, United States Department of Aim'culture Headquarters, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
         <seg id="p532">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture such as: (1) Amount and character of rainfall and other climatic fac - tors. (2) Kind of soil. (3) Degree and length of slope. (4) Amount and kind of vegetative cover. (5) Methods of tillage and systems of soil and crop management. First let us examine some results obtained at the University of Missouri and reported in 1923. In these tests a series of seven plots 1/80 acre in area were laid out on a moderate slope. The plots were surrounded by sheet metal borders and the water and soil lost from each plot during rains was caught in a concrete tank at the foot of each plot. The results are shown in Table I.

However, where there is good crop cover there is less soil carried per unit of runoff water. The kind of soil affects the kind and amount of erosion, but much additional information on this point is needed. The loessial soils in east - ern Nebraska with which the horticulturists of this state are chiefly concerned are known to absorb water readily and, therefore, permit a relatively small amount of runoff. On the other hand, these same soils are subject to severe gullying when once gullies are started. Effect of Slope The degree of slope is also a factor which has considerable, effect on runoff, but more particularly on erosion. The curves in Figures 1 and 2 will illustrate briefly the effect of | slope, as determined by means of artificial applications of water at Manhattan, Kansas". a) Duley F. .and Miller. M. F.

         <seg id="p534">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The curve in Figure 2 shows that there was only a gradual increase in erosion with increase in slope up to 4 or 5% then a greater increase up to 8 or 9 percent and a still greater increase with slopes up to 15 or 20%. Length of Slope The length of the slope is also a factor affecting runoff and erosion. In general longer slopes seem to give a lower percentage of runoff but a greater loss of soil in tons per acre than do equally steep short slopes. Work carried out at a number of experiment stations would seem to bear this out. The results obtained on the loess soils of southwestern lowa may be used as an example. Table 2.

Corn rows with slope 10.5 39.8 Contour Farming One important principle in preventing runoff is to increase absorp - tion by holding water over the surface until it has time to be absorbed. This can be accomplished by various methods of tillage which run across the direction of slope of the hill. Contour farming has been practiced in different parts of the world for centuries, but it is new in the central part of the United States and has never been looked upon with favor to any extent by either general farmers or horticulturists in the Corn Belt States. That contour farming has great value in saving soil and increasing water penetration on soils such as are found in much of eastern Nebraska is well shown in some tests conducted at Clarinda, lowa.

         <seg id="p535">Nebraska State Horticulture Society These results show that by a good system of contour farming a sharp reduction may be made in the amount of runoff taking place from a soil. As a result of this reduced runoff, there is a reduction in the amount of soil erosion and an increase in the percent of soil moisture - and finally an increase in crop yields. There are a number of methods that may be used in contouring land for orchards or farm land. The lister or new type basin lister are implements which have possibilities for greater usefulness. Methods of tillage which keep the runoff distributed over much of the surface afford the best means of inducing maximum absorption of rainfall. On the other hand methods which concentrate the water in limited areas such as along terrace channels or in specially prepared'basins around trees are likely to bring about the deepest penetration into the subsoil. This deep penetration is of very great importance In regions of limited rainfall where the trees must often depend upon moisture in the deep subsoil to carry them through prolonged periods of drought. . In the production of orchards in the middle west where moisture conditions often limit not only fruit production, but the life and vigor of the trees as well, we must give more attention to the maximum utiliza - tion of rainfall and this means that we must provide for its absorption into the deep subsoil. Manure and Crop Residues The addition of organic matter to the surface of orchard soils may have a marked effect in reducing the rate of runoff and erosion. The results of field tests made at Clarinda, lowa, show the effect of treating soils with organic materials. Table 4. Run-off and Erosion from Plots Treated with Green Sweet Clover and with Manure.

The results on the loessial soils of Southwestern lowa are shown in table 5. Table 5.

Any such ma - teria] left on the surface will also tend to reduce evaporation from the soil surface. Summary 1. Vegetative cover reduces runoff and erosion somewhat in pro - portion to the density of cover, but the erosion may be reduced even more than the runoff. 2. Fallow or bare surface reduces the amount of absorption and permits much soil to be carried away. 3. Deep plowing is only slightly more effective than shallow plow - ing in reducing runoff and erosion. Plowed land with a smooth surface usually permits serious erosion. 4. Runoff was found to increase rapidly on fallow soil as the degree of slope increased from level land to about 4 percent. As the slope in - creased above 4 or 5 percent the rate of runoff increased slowly and in the tests reported was only slightly higher for a 15 percent slope than for a 5% slope. 5. The rate of soil erosion in the above tests, however, increased slowly with increase in slope up to 4 or 5 percent. As the slope was in - creased above 8 percent the rate of erosion increased very rapidly. 6. As the length of slope was increased in tests at Clarinda, lowa the amount of runoff per acre decreased, but the rate of erosion increased. 7. Contour tillage is an effective method of increasing moisture penetration and reducing runoff and erosion. 8. Manure or other organic matter on the surface of a soil will in - crease the amount of absorption, reduce runoff, and increase the amount of drainage water carried down into the deep subsoil.

The fundamental principles involved in soil and moisture conserva - tion in orchards are the same as for other types of agriculture, but we must of course make application of these principles in the most practical way to orchard problems. ' \ .-::' ¦••••' •'".;*.-¦*¦¦'. . QUESTION: Is bluegrass better than any other cover you could put in an orchard as far as absorption and run-off is concerned? I thought you got a lot of run-off with bluegrass ? DR. DULEY: j wouldn't want to make that a general statement. I find that a great many people have the idea that grassland gives them a lot of run-off but, in all the experiments we have tried and in practical - ly every test, the grassland has been found to be much more absorptive unless it is badly over-grazed. Then you get a lot of run-off.! We have found -in some soils in Colorado that we get a high run-off m spite of the grass: but it is usually not true here. - ¦ | FRANK SIM: How much of the rainfall will a bluegrass sod use in an orchard? :| DR. DULEY: That is another important angle to the problem. If you dig a post hole in a bluegrass sod, you will find it pretty dry and that means that the grass has used up the water. The amount of water used by the grass may be very high' and that is one reason why sod in an orchard has, in some cases, the effect of robbing the trees of water. FRANK SIM: During these dry years on our farm, we have had more erosion than during thirty years before..Another thing is that fall plowing used to be our best bet for corn but last year the stock ground produced better than the fall plowing. The ground seems to be like it was slaked. DR. DULEY: We have found in a great many cases that where the land is dry, it may come to a condition where it will erode more easily. We have also had in the last few yeaTs, of course, a great amount of dry weather and a great many torrential rains following dry periods which has caused much erosion. D. BAKER: Taking vp v the next part of our program, "How Soil Conservation Districts Will Affect the Orchardists," we will hear from E. Doll, Extension Conservationist. Mr. Doll. MR. DOLL: Dr. Duley has- given us a very good presentation of soil and water losses. He referred to our. shortage of rainfall and I am going to mention it again. I want to call your attention to a rainfall </seg>
         <seg id="p538">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture chart of precipitation since 1868 at Blair, Nebraska. Study of this chart would indicate that we need a water conservation as well as a soil conservation program. HOW SOIL CONSERVATION DISTRICTS WILL AFFECT THE ORCHARDISTS E. H. DOLL In order to get a closer estimate as to what benefits can be expected by carrying on any conservation practices, it is well to consider the wishes of Mother Nature. It has been often said that history repeats itself and so does nature's cycles of rainfall. In wet periods of the cycle we want to save soil and in drouths, both soil and water. A look at this chart giving the rainfall at Blair, which is on the Missouri River, shows the series of dry years are followed by more favorable years as' in the late eighteen sixties, nineties, 1919 to 1924, and the future one ! "just around the corner." Let us look back to see how many recent years we have had with rainfall equal to or above normal. Had it not been for "\ 1931 and 1928 we would have had thirteen consecutive years of below average rainfall. As it is, 1937 marks the sixth consecutive year that ¦ rainfall was below normal. In this six year period there was a total Of 45 inches of water less than for six average years or an average of 7% inches per year. Since the eastern edge of Nebraska as far north as Blair is approximately the rainfall boundary line that divides grassland and forest, one of the present problems of Nebraska fruit growers is that of providing their trees with water. Under the new Soil Conservation Districts Law passed by the 1937 Legislature, and known as Legislative Bill No. 553, it is possible to get assistance in conserving water and soil where districts are organized It is a voluntary plan, affecting only those who wish to cooperate. For the most part conservation assistance will be in technical services of experienced engineers, agronomists, foresters, and soils men. However the districts may own special equipment that is not used every year by the individual farmer. Assistance In Terracing The orchard man who is interested in terracing a field for a new orchard can have the services of an engineer to survey the terrace lines and calculate the size of a terrace to build to fit an apple orchard, a cherry orchard or whatever fruit trees are to be planted. Districts will own graders and caterpillar tractors to be used in building terraces, but no doubt the individual cooperating will have to pay for the oil and fuel used in constructing his terraces.

The loessial soils of southeastern Nebraska need : very little, if any, terrace grade or fall in comparison to the glacial soils found sometimes in the same field. Loessial soils may absorb water eight or ten times asjrapidly as glacial soils, which is quite a factor in laying out a terrace dr an irrigation system. Each cooperator will have a detailed soil map made of his farm by an experienced soils man so that terraces may be properly layed out to fit the soil types. ... Irrigation Plans ''.-..¦"..-- Since irrigation is a water conserving practice, the district's tech - nicians will be permitted to assist landowners with the necessary sur - veys. Where it is desired to dam a gully to impound water for irrigation, a preliminary survey of the watershed will be made giving the acres of drainage with the calculated expected run-off over a period of years. From this survey.the proper place for the dam can be located so as to get the desired capacity without any unnecessary cost of construction. If the supervisors consider the demand is sufficient, large fresnos or tumble bugs or even!a dragline may be purchased to be used by co - operators in dam construction. Another piece of equipment that districts , will probably own will be a bulldozer or large shovel that is attached to the front of a caterpillar tractor and used to knock over steep banks of gullies so that trees, grass or other vegetation may have a better chance to reclaim such gullies. If pump irrigation is to be used the conservation engineer will make a topographic map to locate the highest place of the orchard for the .yell site and also to locate the proper place to put the main channels. , . A Complete Conservation Program No doubt each district will own several sets of basin listing attach - ments to be used to demonstrate another method of conserving moisture particularly when the ground is frozen. Where slopes are over three . percent basin listing should be done on the contour. Contour lines for basin listing or any other tillage operation will be run for a period of five years on whatever crop land the owner and tenant consider it feasible to contour. By having the complete topographic map of the farm, most of the short rows of corn can be eliminated by placing fences on the contour and thus irregular areas and corners can be included in the al - falfa field or small grain. This, in brief, is how the district operates and probably the next point to discuss is the district government.

I will take up the action of moisture in the soil whether water is applied by rainfall or by irrigation.: THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF IRRIGATING 7 HILLY ORCHARDS 7 '¦!¦:.' . R. E. BAKER . The field tests .conducted by the Department of Horticulture of the University of Nebraska in 1935-1937 have emphasized the progress - ive depletion of available soil moisture throughout the soil profile of many of the orchards in the state (23, 24). This indicates that the an - nual rainfall is insufficient for the proper maintenance of mature or - chards under present practices. It may be advisable to supplement the annual rainfall with the application of irrigation water. The proper distribution of irrigation water over square planted orchards having a rolling topography Introduces many practical problems. Orchard irri - gation is a relatively new practice for this state and its use may intro - duce problems regarding the physiology of fruit trees. We recognize '•: the fact that there are a number of orchards for which irrigation water is not economically available. On these orchards it may be possible that ¦'; wider tree spacing' and some type of mulch may provide sufficient moisture for economic fruit production. In consideration of this moisture problem the efforts of this department are now focused largely on a , number of phases of orchard irrigation and moisture conservation. My experience with irrigation principles and practice is entirely :...--¦ Californian. .However, many of the irrigation methods used in Cali - fornia may be applicable to Nebraska conditions; moreover, many of the irrigation principles taught there can be applied to Nebraska condi - [ tions because these principles are applicable wherever soil moisture studies are conducted. Soil moisture acts the same whether supplied by irrigation water or natural rainfall. For this reason fruit growers -who </seg>
         <seg id="p542">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture know they cannot irrigate their orchards may be interested in some of these principles which I will mention prior to the discussion of irriga - tion methods. The basis of all soil moisture principles is the soil itself. All soils are composed of individual particles arranged in a rather definite man - ner. The size of the particles determines the soil texture and the arrange - ment determines the structure. Regardless of the texture or structure considerable pore space exists between the soil particles. When water is applied to the soil surface and allowed to penetrate into the sub - stratum it will first fill the pore space and saturate the soil. Water in this form is called gravitational water. In a well drained soil a known quantity of water will be pulled downward through the soil profile to an estimable depth by the force of gravity. Usually at the end of two or three days soil moisture conditions will approach an equilibrium and no appreciable downward movement of water will take place until more water is added to the surface of the soil. This moisture condition is called the field capacity of the soil. This factor can be obtained in the laboratory by moisture equivalent determinations (21). Burr and Russell reported that M. E. for loess soils of Nebraska is 91% of field capacity (2). The soil water now exists in the form of films around the soil par - ticles or as wedges between the soil particles at their points of contact (20). Soil water in this form is called capillary water because it can move to a limited extent by capillarity. Veihmeyer and Hendrickson have emphasized to limit of capillary movement. Shaw and Smith have indicated that water may move for distances of one or two feet in soil at a moderately rapid rate, especially when the soil moisture content is appreciably above the wilting percentage (11). The amount of capillary water is influenced by soil texture and structure. In general the heavier soils have higher capacities than the light textured soils. The field capacity is usually expressed as the percentage of the oven dry weight of soil. The tree will function normally when soil moisture is between field capacity and a definite point above the p.w.p. of the particular soil. Photosynthesis and related activities, as far as is known, proceed at a normal rate (11). However, under conditions of summer transpiration the tree roots cannot supply water at a sufficiently rapid rate to prevent temporary wilting during a portion of the day. As a result the physio - logical processes proceed at a reduced rate. With a usually reduced evaporating power of the air at night the tree will recover. In light to medium heavy soils the tree is able to withdraw the moisture without any noticeable difficulty almost to a point called the permanent wilting percentage (5, 6). When the permanent wilting percentage is reached the tree will not recover from wilting even though placed in a moist atmosphere. Additional water must be added to the soil for recovery (20). The amount of water in the soil is influenced principally by the </seg>
         <seg id="p543">Nebraska State Horticulture Society soil texture and structure. Briggs and Shantz and Veihmeyer and Hendrickson have determined the permanent wilting percentage for many soils. Maximov and Shull have defined it as the point at which capillarity ceases. In heavy soils fruit trees have difficulty in with - drawing the soil moisture at a point considerably above the permanent wilting percentage (11). This is because of slower capillary movement in heavy soils and less complete root distribution. Conrad and Veihmeyi., Aldrich, Work, and Lewis have shown that the rate of water absorption in a soil area is proportional to the feeder root population (11). In shallow soils with high water tables and heavy soils of eastern states many of the roots are in the surface foot or eighteen inches (11)!',' On lighter, well drained soils the distribution is more nearly even down to a depth of several feet although the sur - face foot has the densest population. Some unpublished work of this department on Jonathan apple trees shows a good root penetration to a depth of 28 feet (2, 5). The root population of the surface foot was the densest. The first fifteen feet of soil indicated a considerably denser population than the next 13 feet below. A good lateral spread to 22 feet was indicated and the first nine feet from the tree had a population ¦ nearly twice as great as the next 13 feet. In the irrigated districts of the west on medium textured soils the root population is fairly uniform for several feet,.but even here the surface foot has the densest popula - tion. There if the first six feet of soil has reached the permanent wilting percentage the tree will wilt even though there is available moisture below that point (5, 6). When a portion of the root zone reaches the permanent wilting percentage we have no indication that the root zone having available water will increase the rate of absorption. However, the work of Auchter and of Furr and Taylor has shown that there is ¦'.- - free movement of water throughout the tree and that water supplied by the roots in one area-is apparently equally available to all parts of the tree top (11). Mature prune trees in California have been known to re - duce the soil moisture content to the hygroscopic coefficient. This is . considerably i below the critical moisture content (19). Results of this ;; kind have not been recorded in Nebraska. At hygroscopic coefficient the films, and wedges of water are extremely thin, representing the amount of water oven dry soil will absorb from a saturated atmosphere. There are a number of ways in which fruit trees respond to a lack 7 of available soil moisture. First, there is a slowing down of all physio - -. logical processes. Vegetative growth is less. Portions of branches, or entire branches may die back, and fruit will!be smaller and may drop. There is a decrease in total carbohydrates and an increase in the per- R; cent of soluble carbohydrates. Cork, drouth spot and related diseases may result. Leaves may drop early, and trees are more subject to 77 winter injury (10). As a secondary result the tree is more likely to be :¦'.," attacked by insect pests and diseases. Field observations indicate that •¦y apple varieties may differ in their water usage. Grimes, Jonathan, </seg>
         <seg id="p544">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Wealthy, Gano, and Ben Davis apparently deplete the available soil moisture at a more rapid rate than Winesap or Black Twig.!'lf addi - tional soil samples verify this, it may explain the fact that the former varieties are shorter lived than the Winesap group. If the soil moisture is maintained to a satisfactory degree above the permanent wilting percentage but not beyond the field, capacity, the tree is existing under optimum conditions as far as soil moisture is concerned (11). Usually these conditions are not maintained in regions of light rainfall without the application of irrigation water. Drouthy conditions may exist for short periods during the season even under conditions of heavy rainfall. A number of experiments have been con - ducted to determine the necessary frequency of application and the total amount of irrigation water to apply in a single season. Orchard irrigation studies in the Rogue River Valley, Oregon, gave very favor - able results in regard to vegetative growth and fruit production. The soil moisture data, however, is not on the basis of available moisture (9). Some work done in southern Arizona on rather deep soils indicated that the application of .0 inches to apricot or peach trees during the dormant season was sufficient for the entire season. One additional application was sometimes advisable during the growing season (18). Downing of Idaho reported increased vegetative growth and fruit pro - duction with irrigation but their work is not on the basis of available moisture (17). The Washington station reported that 30-36 acre inches of water properly applied was sufficient to supply the main root zone of Jonathan apple trees on a shallow soil. Available moisture main - tained to a depth of three feet produced the greatest number of fancy apples. Available moisture to a depth of four feet produced the greatest number of apples. The greatest number of large apples was produced with available moisture to a depth of six feet. Good vegetative growth was produced with all three practices (15). J. R. Magness reported that apple trees use approximately 20-24 inches of moisture during a single season (10). Hendrickson and Veihmeyer of the California Agricultural Ex - periment Station have reported results obtained with the irrigation of prunes and peaches on deep soils (5, 6). Trees which received a con - stant supp'y of available moisture produced more growth and better yields of fruit than trees subjected to drouth for 5 or 6 weeks. Trees which were permitted to reach the permanent wilting percentage for a short time (one week) produced yields about as high as the wet p:ots. The growth rate of peaches was affected only when the perma - nent wilting percentage was reached. The sugar and acid content of fruit from the wet plot was higher on a dry weight basis. The critical point of soil moisture for prunes and peaches is near the end of the pit hardening stage. Trees wilted when the upper six feet of soil was exhausted of soil moisture even though available moisture existed be - low that point. The moisture in this area on clay loam soils was ex- </seg>
         <seg id="p545">Nebraska State Horticulture Society hausted in six weeks in midsummer. Reduced vegetative growth is most striking if moisture is unavailable during the period of rapid growth early in the season. The soil moisture at any point from the ; field capacity to about the permanent wilting percentage was readily available for use by the trees. Plagge reported that the irrigation of Golden Delicious trees heavily late in summer did not materially change the nitrogen content of apples or make them more susceptible to soggy breakdown (16). If soil moisture is suddenly made available following a summer drouth second growth may take place. If the terminal buds were al - ready growing at a decreased rate there would be a sudden flush of growth. If the buds had stopped growth but were not completely dormant they may actually break and renew growth due to the stimu, - lation of the soil moisture suddenly made available (4). Abell of Utah noted that trees which were subjected to summer drouth, nd fall rains often produced second growth (19). This type of wood is often very subject to winter injury. Hendrickson and Veihmeyer reported that irrigated and unirrigated trees supplied with available moisture en - tered the rest period at about the same time. The splitting of the flesh ¦ and seeds of pome and stone fruits is sometimes attributed to soil moisture conditions similar to those which.cause "second growth" (4). The splitting of Stayman Winesap apples results from an increased atmospheric humidity. If the soil moisture content is allowed to remain above the field capacity a number of detrimental effects will occur. Chlorosis may re - sult as a lack of aeration. Scaly bark and water core are associated with water excess (4). An analyses of results obtained by investigators in other states emphasizes the fact that it is not possible to predict results that may be obtained under Nebraska soil and climatic conditions. Information - is needed on the depth of soil in which available moisture should be . maintained for most profitable fruit production. Should we maintain available moisture in the first three feet or the first fifteen feet, and i how frequently must this zone be irrigated during the season? The '; root distribution of Jonathan apple trees and the soil samples taken in the field indicate that deep, infrequent irrigations may be preferable. H More evidence is needed to substantiate this point. Can the fruit trees 4 in the loess soils of Nebraska utilize soil moisture down to about the 'i permanent wilting percentage? Is it possible to maintain profitable '-''( fruit production through drouth periods and drouth years by soil and | moisture conservation methods? Questions like these may be answered R by data obtained from experiments to be conducted by this depart - -7 ment. .: . Perhaps the phase of orchard irrigation in which many growers </seg>
         <seg id="p546">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture of this state are interested is the actual distribution of water. There are three different classes of distribution systems: (1) Surface irri - gation where water is spread over the ground by furrows or flooding; (2) sprinkler irrigation where the water is delivered under pressure in pipes and is applied in the form of fine drops, spray, or mist through sprinkler heads, perforated pipes, or canvas hose; (3) subirrigation where water is delivered to the root zone of the plants by some under- j ground method (14). This third method is not applicable to the irri - gation of Nebraska orchards because the necessary soil and moisture conditions do not exist. However, there are several methods of surface and sprinkler irrigation which might be adaptable. j The actual design of the irrigation system should be entrusted to ¦',' an agricultural enginesr. His first step would be to prepare a contour . map of the orchard area. A study of this map will enable him to plan systems for new or old plantings. Its principal use is possibly for the location of distribution lines and determination of the direction of irrigation for surface methods. For new orchard plantings the contour furrow method of irrigation is one of the best for rolling topography (8). This involves the estab - lishment of tree rows along grade contours. In general there are three types of contour layouts. j 1. Uniform spacing of trees along a grade contour without regard j to alignment. This type does not form smooth curves along the contour j and the crossrows are not straight. Cross cultivation is hindered and , broken furrows are not easily detected. , \ 2. Uneven spacing along grade contour with straight crossrows. j On the even slopes rows are parallel. On the knoUs the rows are usually !, placed radially. Cross cultivation is permitted but there may be fewer ! trees per acre. i 3. Trees planted on varying grades with straight crossrows. This ; is an advantage in cultivating but causes uneven water penetration if j the grade varies appreciably. j With any of the three layouts it may be necessary to use stub il rows, fill rows, or spike rows on very uneven slopes. It is often difficult j to distribute water to the fill rows and spike rows but it is necessary that they be included to make use of as much ground as possible where contour lines diverge or tend to converge. Water is distributed to the tree rows from flumes or pipes laid down the slope on a line determined by a study of the contour map. From outlets in the flumes or pipes the water is directed into furrows along the grade contours above each tree row. A slight modification of this system is the use of a basin for each tree if bench terraces are </seg>
         <seg id="p547">Nebraska State Horticulture Society developed. The basins are filled from a single furrow above. Either of these methods will give a fairly uniform penetration of water. In this regard the soil type and grade of contour must be considered in decid - ing upon the spacing of furrows and length of run. Long runs result in deep penetration at the upper end of the furrow. This is unde - sirable because the trees at the'other end of the row will exhaust the available soil moisture before the first trees need additional water. The spacing of furrows must be sufficiently close to permit satisfactory lateral spread. The.length of run is not as important with the basin method because the basins are filled individually from the single fur - row, starting at the lower end, The efficiency on steep slopes is higher with contour planting than where furrows are run straight down the hill. This is because of the greater lateral spread. Contour planted orchards on the Pacific coast are usually clean cultivated during the growing season and planted to an annual cover crop during the winter. If the furrow system is used it is possible that a sod or sod mulch could be used, but this would present many problems. It would prevent the efficient operation of mowing, spraying, and harvesting machinery, A system of modified basins would necessitate clean cultivation and cover crops because of the cross checks.-.'-' The irrigation of established orchards which are square planted on rolling topography: often presents many practical problems. How - ever, there are several methods of distribution which can be con - sidered. . ,-'.-. 'j'.-. &#132; Very often a study of a contour map will reveal that a portion of an orchard can be irrigated by a system of furrows on a relatively flat grade (3). This means that certain tree rows will be a'most on the contour. This type of irrigation would be handled in the same manner as described for contour furrows. Sprinkler irrigation is one method with which most growers are rather familiar. It is probably very well known as an ideal but very expensive system. For the irrigation of apple orchards the under-tree type of sprinkler is recommended by the Washington Station (15), A reaction type of sprinkler head is used. It is usually about thirty inches above the ground and it will cover an area 30-60 feet in diameter at 15 to 30 pounds pressure per square inch (22). There are two general types of sprinkler systems. One is a type in which the entire j system is stationary. This type will cost from $200 to $350 per acre j' not including the cost of the pump. The other system can be designed -J in varying degrees of portability and will cost from $40 to $150 per .j acre. It is possible to secure a very uniform coverage with sprinkling. There is little or no waste water w'th proper operation. The mainten - : ance of available moisture in the surface foot of soil favors bacterial ; activity and a possibly greater concentration of plant nutrients in the •; soil solution (15). The cost of installation of the system can be esti- </seg>
         <seg id="p548">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture mated for your orchard but the cost of operation cannot be estimated until more is known about the depth and frequency of applications of irrigation water. Practically any type of soil management program which maintains a supply of organic matter in the surface soil is suit - able for sprinkler irrigation. Very recently Mantle and Mantle of Paineville, Ohio, have de - veloped an eyelet canvas hose which may prove to be of value for orchard irrigation (12). This type of hose will sprinkle an area 20 feet wide under 4 pounds pressure per square inch. The sprinkling is done by four tiny eyelets placed in a circle in the hose about every two feet. Thus no matter which way the hose is laid water will be sprayed in both directions. The cost is 17c per foot. At 4# pressure it will deliver forty gallons per minute per 100 feet of hose. An eleva - tion of about 11-12' will be required to maintain this pressure. At nine pounds pressure it will deliver 75 gallons per minute per 100 feet of hose, covering a space 30 feet wide. If desirable the pressure can be increased to 14# pressure per square inch to secure 100 gallons of water per minute per 100 feet of hose, covering an area 40 feet wide. The use of eyelet hose offers many of the advantages of a portable sprinkling system without the necessity of relatively high pressures for operation. This company also makes a porous canvas hose which is used to a very limited extent for orchard irrigation (7). If the hose is placed lengthwise along the contour of the slope the water will ooze through the hose and flood down the hill about 25 feet. A pressure of 4# per square inch is needed for efficient operation. Soil management methods suitable for sprinkling would be satisfactory for eyelet or porous canvas hose irrigation. There are three types of surface irrigation that may be applicable to the irrigation of Nebraska orchards. Basin, wild flooding, and the corrugation method. Most of the growers of this state are familiar with the basin method of irrigation which is being used on the University fruit farm at Union. A semicircular earth dike is constructed above each trea. These dikes form basins by reason of the slope and are effective in holding water supplied by irrigation or rainfall. Water is conducted from the main pipe line to some of the basins by means of canvas con - ductor hose and ditch laterals. Each individual tree is irrigated by filling the basin with water. In many cases the system has been de - signed to permit overflow from one basin to the next one below. In this way water is conducted to several basins with comparatively little attendance. The materials for this system are relatively inex - pensive but a considerable amount of hand labor is necessary for the construction of the basins. The coverage possible on steep slopes is very limited. Only about 1/10 of the soil mass occupied by a tree can be irrigated on 10-15% slopes. This means that only 10% of the roots </seg>
         <seg id="p549">Nebraska State Horticulture Society are benefited from the standpoint of absorption of the applied water and of the plant nutrients dissolved in it. If several basins are filled by means of the overflow system, the basin at the upper end will have a much larger application of water. This is due to the fact that the basin is full for a greater length of time than the basins below. The basin method is nevertheless one inexpensive method of applying suffi - cient water to carry the trees through a dry season. It is also a means of conserving rainfall runoff by holding the water until it penetrates into the soil. Wild flooding is a surface method used on rather steep, even slopes. It is a very inexpensive means of distributing water but it may also be very unsatisfactory. The main feed lines are located by a study of the contour map. The water is conducted from the main line in ditch laterals on a non-eroding grade. These laterals are spaced at slope intervals of 50-300 feet, depending upon the soil type. The water is flooded over the area betweenthe ditches merely bymeans of cutting outlets at necessary intervals in the ditch embankment to secure satis - factory coverage. On rather steep, even slopes the coverage obtained will be nearly complete by efficient operation. On rolling topography a great deal of labor is necessary to spread the water. It is sometimes necessary to construct short ditches or dikes at an angle to the slope direction in order to wet the ridges. Fruit growers often refer to this process as "herding the water." It is best to use heads of 20 miner's inches or more to permit good distribution. In order to prevent irri - gation erosion a sod or sod mulch is always used. It is possible that a straw mulch may be equally effective (1)."! I know of a few growers in California who have used this method with success on small acreages. On large acreages it is doubtfulif it would be advisable unless condi - tions were very favorable.' ; Mr. J. C. Marr of the U.S.D.A. developed the corrugation method of surface irrigation for uncultivated crops and pastures on rolling, uneven topography in the northwest (13). This system is used to a j limited extent for the irrigation of pears in California. The water is j distributed to ditch laterals in the same manner as described for wild I' flooding. From the laterals extremely small heads of water are al. V lowed to Sow down small shallow fills or corrugations which extend 1 down the steepest slope with the tree rows. The corrugations are suffi - .; ciently close together to permit complete coverage by lateral spread. j ; The spacing and length of run will depend upon the soil type. If this | system is designed properly a very uniform coverage is obtained with J a minimum of labor required. The most objectionable feature of Mr. | Marr's design is the method of conducting the water from the lateral •i to the corrugations. Mr. Marr has a very effective design involving j the use of dams, pipe, secondary level ditches and baffles. This setup •j has proved to be effective for the irrigation of grain, alfalfa and pas- </seg>

It is |g not practical for orchard use, however, because it is an obstruction to || equipment. It may be possible to design a satisfactory substitute for -.;_« this part of the system. Short pipes could be used at the proper in- » terval and level to conduct the water from the lateral through the bank g on the lower side. It would be necessary to place a temporary wood or | metal dam in the ditch just below the pipe inlet to raise the water to | » level at which it would flow into the pipe. If the pipes were set low | enough to dispense with the use of dams a valve would then be necessary I to prevent flow of water through pipes not in use. A large eyelet hose (' of proper length could then be fastened to the end of the pipe. If the | hose were placed lengthwise along the base of the ditch bank the large I eyelets would serve as a means of distributing the water to the in- \ dividual corrugations. A sod or sod mulch is always used with the j corrugation system in order to prevent irrigation erosion. It is pos- ! sible that a straw mulch may offer satisfactory control. &#132; In the establishment of the corrugation system the main distribu - tion lines and laterals are located by a study of the contour map and a field survey. The next step is the installation of the main lines. The corrugations are then made before the laterals are constructed. How-' ever, it is best to know the approximate location of the laterals, in order to determine the direction for the corrugations. The corrugations should extend directly down the steepest slope with the tree rows. There are a number of different types of farm equipment that might be satisfactory for making the corrugations. A spring tooth harrow equipped with cultivator shovels may be satisfactory on fairly clean ground. A disk type ditcher or furrow machine is best for trashy ground because it will not become clogged with weeds, sod or strJrvv. Some growers use a disc harrow with many of the discs removed. If large concrete blocks are dragged behind the harrow at intervals where corrugations are desired, the blocks will serve to make a firm, rounded, shallow corrugation. This is the most desirable type because it per - mits the growth of vegetation to a greater degree than a V-shaped corrugation. If ditch laterals are used they should be constructed last. A turning plow can be used for this work, but some hand labor will be necessary to smooth the ditch bank and to dig the ditch where it is located close to a tree. The pipes can be inserted in the bank at any time that seems best. The soil should be tamped firmly around the pipes to avoid their being washed out of place. If it is desirable to seed a cover crop this work should be done preferably by hand methods after the system has been installed. Too much emphasis cannot be placed, upon the fact that sufficient vegetative protection of some sort is necessary to prevent irrigation erosion in the corrugations. Although this system presents a somewhat rough, bumpy surface for travel across the slope, it is a very effective inexpensive means of distributing water over fairly large acreages. </seg>

'.-'.'- DR. WIGGANS: As most of you are familiar with the scheme we are using at Union, I need not say very much about that. ¦ We are taking water out of the creek at the rate of 3 acre-inches per day.

ORCHARD SOIL MOISTURE STUDIES .''-.¦¦ C. C. WIGGANS :]':l. iSoil moisture studies made by the Department of Horticulture, University of Nebraska, during the past year have continued some of the earlier work and also have entered new fields. It is the purpose of this paper to report briefly upon certain phases of the project— thus supplying members of the Nebraska Horticultural Society with information concerning any moisture changes wbich have taken place since last year in certain representative areas and also giving a pre - liminary report upon the irrigation project so recently initiated at the University Fruit Farm. Generally speaking, the past season has been much below normal in precipitation and much above normal in temperature particularly during the latter part of the season. Both these conditions are con - ducive to excessive use of subsoil water by deep rooted plants—and often severe damage occurs if subsoil water is not available. This damage manifests itself by reduced plant growth, small leaves and fruit and, in severe cases, even death of the tree. Undoubtedly, borer damage has also been greatly increased by this type of environment. How Much Water Have the Trees Removed During the 1937 Season? This is a question of fundamental importance to the fruit grower, particularly if it is considered in conjunction with the query as to how long can such a drain be endured. As many of you are well aware, deep soil samples for moisture i determinations have been made in many Nebraska orchards during the past three or four years. One year of sampling is illuminating as to conditions at that time but when samplings are made at yearly intervals at the same spot, much more definite information becomes available. No effort will be made to present all the data now in hand but some representee figures will be given. While all sampling dates were not just a year apart the interval does usually represent quite well one season's demand for water. Details have been given I " -¦.--.-¦¦. \ -',"¦-¦¦ V - -¦¦''.¦. &gt;- -'.'".'•¦' </seg>
         <seg id="p554">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture in earlier reports as to methods of sampling and making the deter - minations and hence are omitted here. In the accompanying table are presented some details concerning the age, spacing, etc. together with soil moisture percentage averages for the various five foot zones. Also from the differences between the averages for the two dates has been calculated the amount of soil moisture taken out in the interval. This calculation is based upon the assumption that a difference of 6% moisture in one foot is equivalent to 1 inch of water. Thus an average loss of 1% for 30 feet equals a loss of 5 inches (i. c. 1%x30=30% ¦*- 6=5 inches). From the results presented several conclusions can be drawn. 1. In young orchards such as the Sautter planting the loss is relatively small and one which can easily be replaced by seasonal rain - fall. 2. In rapidly growing or heavy producing orchards such as those of Marshalls, Stivers, and Bowman, there is a tremendous drain upon the subsoil reserve—a drain which may be equivalent to one-half of the average annual rainfall. 3. With close spacing the depletion proceeds at a more r-apid rate than where wider planting distances are used. (Compare the Sims and Stivers results.) 4. With advancing tree age the percentage of soil moisture steadily decreases. (Compare the two Lewis plantings.) 5. As an orchard nears or passes the 25 year mark the depletion rate becomes quite low since there is then comparatively little reserve left for tree use. This is undoubtedly the situation in the Keyser, Slocum and Beavers plantings. Such plantings must from now on de - pend entirely upon annual precipitation to supply its needs. The or - chards in question had either very little production in 1937 (Beavers) or failed to properly size up the fruit which was produced (Slocum and Keyser). 6. The above conclusions and a consideration of the soil moisture reserve calculated to now remain in the older orchards (last line in the tabular form) only lends emphasis to recommendations given previously, namely (1) plant orchards on sites which have not been occupied re - cently by deep rooted crops; (2) use wide spacing; (3) employ every cultural means such as contour planting, etc., to conserve the annual precipitation for the use of the tree. It should be clearly understood that these results apply to the season of 1937. When rainfall and temperatures again are normal un - doubtedly the drain will be greatly reduced in all cases and possibly </seg>
         <seg id="p555">Nebraska State Horticulture Society entirely eliminated in others. There is little question, however, but that •old orchards in this territory need more water than they can get from natural rainfall when the ordinary spacings are used. Another thing which must be kept in mind is that all of the samples taken were not from comparable locations. For instance, in the Stivers orchard the sampling station was only 8 feet from the tree while in the Kimmel orchard it was approximately 25 feet. In view of the known fact that water near the tree is: exhausted first the losses calculated for the various orchards are hot, therefore, strictly comparable. The implication seems to be clear in all cases, however, that measures should be taken to conserve soil moisture. Such means, some of which have already been employed, are severe "fanning" or entire removal of the filler varieties. What can be done to conserve water? The orcbardist who has no supplemental water supply available is faced with the necessity of finding other means of lessening the drain on the subsoil water. Re - pression of the cover crop growth by frequent mowing, severe pruning, removal of some of the trees, the construction of simple terraces or the elimination of competing annual crops by cultivation or mulching, are some of the methods which may be employed, :' At the University Fruit Farm a test involving the use of a heavy mulch of straw has been under way for the past three seasons. Soil samples taken in the filler black before the mulch was applied showed that there was little soil moisture remaining for tree use to a depth of thirty feet. It will be recalled that in the late winter of 1936-37 there was quite a coating of ice formed on top of frozen soil. When this melted there, was much runoff under normal circumstances but none at all from the mulched area mentioned above. On May 19, 1937, comparable soil samples were taken in the mulched and unmulched areas. The accom - panying table indicates the relative soil moisture conditions.

         <seg id="p556">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Inspection of these data shows that there was decidedly more water in the mulched soil. Translation of this difference into terms of inches of water reveals that the mulched soil possessed over 4 inches of water more than was held by the unmulched block. Practically all of this was in the upper four feet. Thus the mulched area was in shape to supply at least one extra month's needs before beginning to draw on the subsoil reserve. From these results it would seem that mulching is one effective way of conserving rainfall. In some other blocks where good fruit crops were produced other effects of the mulch could be measured. Reference is made to the fruit size at harvest time. Apples from mulched and unmulched areas were run over the sizer with the results indicated below.

This effect was much more marked in the case of Jonathan and Winesap than it was with the Wea'thy—possibly because the full effects of moisture deficiency were exerted more strongly on the later maturing sorts. While these data apply to only one season, they arc at least suggestive of benefits occur - ing from water conservation due to the use of a mulch. What is the effect of supplemental water? As most of the members of this Society are aware, there was installed at the University Fruit Farm during the past winter and spring a pump irrigation system. By means of a motor driven pump, water is lifted to the ridge running through the orchard and distributed from outlets located at intervals along the pipe line. That this orchard has need annually for mors water than is avail - able from rainfa'l has already been pointed out (see the two preceding reports). This need perhaps has been much aggravated by the sub - normal precipitation of recent years. The accompanying table shows the monthly precipitation at the Fruit Farm for the past four years - only one of which—l93s—approached anywhere near the normal figure. Even 1935 was about 15 . below the long time average for the nearby Nebraska City observation station while the others were 30-40% short. </seg>
         <seg id="p557">Nebraska State Horticulture Society •. ¦ i . .. - -.-¦-' - - While a single drouth year will affect trees less .seriously than it does shallow rooted species, a series of such years may. be very damaging even to deep rooted crops. Under conditions such as these the effects of supplemental water should be quite evident. In making plans for the application of this water it has been as - sumed that every tree in the orchard really was suffering from a water shortage. An effort was made, therefore, to supply all trees, except those reserved for definite experiments, with some water. This was applied at the rate of approximately one inch every two weeks from about the first of June until in November. Some eight or ten inches were thus supplied. This water was confined within individual basins and was thus concentrated in a smallarea instead of being distributed generally over the whole surface. From the standpoint of water con - servation this is probably more efficient than the general distribution because less was used by annual species or lost by direct evaporation but it remains to be seen what may be the effects on the tress of having only a small portion of its root zone well supplied with water.

These areas were diked so that flood irrigation could be used. By measuring the amount of water pumped it could then be determined how much was applied to these areas. Also since runoff was entirely eliminated soil moisture studies should permit the determination of the water requirements of a mature orchard. Unfortunately only a few of these areas were completed for use in 1937 and hence only a preliminary report can be given at this time. Plans are under way, however, to complete these before the coming *Snow calculated as 10% moisture. </seg>

It must always fl be kept in mind that irrigation experiments are long time tests and If hence quick results will be the exception and not the rule. : jg-' I The principal measures of the effect of irrigation water during X the past year are available in the form of soil moisture data. While it fi did seem evident that water improved considerably the size—particular- | ly in the Wealthy—no data are given on that point In some of the j definite experimental areas, especially in the Delicious, there was. ! practically no crop. In such cases, however, there did appear to be ! more vigorous growth than was present in unwatered areas. . ' ! Soil moisture determinations were made under two sets of condi - tions: .11 in one of the basins, and (2) in an experimental area where an attempt was made to fully replenish soil moisture to a depth of thirty feet. In the first instance a location was selected where a basin 5-6 ft. wide and 10-12 feet long was situated adjacent to a 19 year old De - licious tree. One hole was put down in the center of the basin (some 5-6 feet from the tree), another two feet outside the basin, another five feet farther away, another in the center of the intersection (22% feet from the tree), and a fifth one near an unwatered tree. The re - sulting data averaged for 5 foot zones are given in the accompanying table. (See next page.l Several pertinent observations may be based on these data. 1. Water had penetrated to the 17th foot just beneath the basin and for the greater share of this distance the soil was filled to capacity. 2. There had been some lateral movement of water since the sample taken 2 feet outside the basin showed replenishment from the 3rd to the 14th foot.

There was no effect noticeable at seven feet from the basin but intervening sampling probably would have shown spread beyond the 2nd lateral foot. 4. There is less water available for tree use as the sampling sta - tion becomes closer to the tree location, as can be seen by a comparison of the last two columns. 5. Calculating the amount of soil moisture in terms of rainfall, the area underneath the basin had been replenished to the extent of approximately 36 inches and that just outside the basin to about 21 inches. It is quite possible that the basin area is equivalent to about 5% and the next zone to about 10% of the total surf ace available for each tree, i.e., 30x33 feet.

         <seg id="p562">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture It should not be less than 25 feet deep. I would run some moisture tests and then plant the trees on the level contour. Whether I terraced or not would depend upon the slope. A natural terrace might be built by cultivation. I think the planting probably should be 40 feet apart each way for a long time proposition. There are, of course, other angles. If you are willing to give up your orchard when it gets in bad condition as far as moisture is con - cerned and plant a new one, that's a different thing. We may come to the orchard rotation system. Maybe twice as many trees, and getting as much as possible out of them, will be the thing in the future. DEARLE BAKER: I am sure that the discussion we have just heard has been very interesting. Most of us know that there is some - thing wrong with our trees and evidently they are thirsty. I believe that the Department is on the right track in trying to get the informa - tion which they are getting and perhaps some policy will come from that information which will help us to get some of this moisture back into the soil through natural rainfall. It isn't practical for all the growers to irrigate so we have to depend on nature and I am sure we will be able to work out something pretty soon that will help. I only hope that all of our trees will not die before that time comes. I think you will agree we have had a very interesting program today and especially this afternoon. We have more tomorrow and I hope you will all return in the morning so we can start promptly and we will try to be through by noon. Are there any announcements? MR. HOPPERT: The cider press will be in operation at the orchard before the meeting if any of you wish to avail yourselves of the opportunity of seeing how it is installed and how it works. Meeting adjourned for the day. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10th, Forenoon Plant Industry Building Meeting called to order by Dearie Baker, President. DEARLE BAKER: Our meeting will now come to order. The first talk we have on our program this morning is one by Prof. F. B. Paddock of the Agricultural College at Ames, lowa. His subject is listed on the printed program, "Bee Keeping as a Side Line for the Orchardist," but he changed this to "Bees for Orchard Pollination". If any of you wish Mr. Paddock to discuss the advertised topic, I'm sure he will be pleased to oblige you. BEES FOR ORCHARD POLLINATION F. B. PADDOCK, Ames, lowa Any consideration of the problem of orchard pollination must take into account some of the fundamentals of successful pollination. The </seg>
         <seg id="p563">i Nebraska State Horticulture Society presence of bees will not accomplish the desired and expected purpose without these fundamentals and with them it is possible to secure a satisfactory result with the use of bees in the orchard. There must be present in the orchard in order to secure proper pollination, first, a suitable pollen in the form of varieties capable of producing fruit when the pollen is carried to the stigma of other varieties present, and second, there must be an adequate supply of pollinators to insure cross-pollina - tion. During the past few years extensive commercial plantings have been made in large blocks of one variety, or without a wholesome regard of the proper varieties to be used as pollen sources for the orchard. It is probably this fact which has led to a more thorough appreciation of the need and value of bees for orchard pollination than any other single factor. Of course it must be realized that there has been a great reduc - tion in the number of wild bees present in almost any community and it is also true in a good many instances that the number of hive bees has been reduced in the vicinity of some of the fruit growing regions. . It is true that the need of bees for cross-pollination has been felt less in some of the middle western states than it. has in the states where commercial orcharding has reached its highest development. The con - ditions which may exist in Nebraska and lowa are not intense! enough to have an exaggerated problem in the matter of cross-pollination so that the orchardist has been rather reluctant to feel that a problem existed in fact. There are other factors which must be recognized in the set of fruit for efficient returns in commercial orcharding. The geographical position of the orchard must of course have this influence upon the problem of pollination. This is closely associated with the general pre - vailing climate of the locality. It is evident that severe winter killing in the territory is harmful to general orcharding conditions. Extreme drouth in either winter or summer is disastrous. Soil "fertility, orchard management, the control of insects and diseases have their place in the problem of efficient returns from an apple orchard, but the basic consideration is that of a properly planted orchard which is aided in cross-pollination by the hive bees. Since the natural conditions have:been extremely favorable in this section, there has been, a tendency to disregard the need of special at - tention to pollination. It was for that reason that demonstrations were undertaken a few years ago in. lowa, particularly in cooperation with Robert M. Clark of Mitchellville, at that time, president of the State Horticultural Society. - Mr. Clark is the operator of an extensive com - mercial orchard and is considered to be a successful operator. Mr, Clark became interested several years prior to that time in the possibility of improving the set of fruit through the use of bees in the orchard during the blooming period. When the demonstrations were undertaken Mr. Clark was satisfied as to the value of bees for pollination purposes, </seg>
         <seg id="p564">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture but there were still several question developing on the refined use of the bees in order to secure the maximum benefits from them. It was already evident through Mr. Clark's experience that bees represented one of the biggest single factors in the production of his yearly crop. It was also evident that the set of fruit on the Winesap trees could be much improved through the liberal use of bees, although this variety is not always considered as one needing cross-pollination services. It is recognized as a shy bearer and for that reason Mr. Clark wanted to satisfy himself as to the value of bees in his block of old Winesap trees. Mr. Clark was also interested in the possibility of encouraging earlier bearing by several varieties of apples through the use of bees in blocks of young orchards of several varieties. Demonstrations conducted by Mr. Clark indicated that it was possible to increase the yield of his old orchard many times that of the cost for the rental of the bees. He showed that it was possible to in - crease materially the set of Winesap trees of old age. He was able to show that it is possible to encourage earlier fruiting of young trees through the liberal use of bees in such plantings. It seemed quite evi - dent from these demonstrations that the presence of bees under the average conditions as they exist in this section are highly beneficial under almost any combination of conditions within the orchard. The matter of crop insurance through the use of bees was clearly shown during the first year of the demonstration. The bees had been moved into the orchard for the normal bloom date. Blooms were avail - able in profussion but weather conditions prevailed day after day to prevent flight by the bees. A break occurred on the eighth day and the bees literally swarmed out of the hives from 2 to 4 o'clock when the sun clouded over and the chill winds returned. It was during this two - hour flight that the bees were able to visit enough blooms to effect cross - pollination sufficient for a fair crop of fruit. This crop came when other orchardists had no set of fruit for bees were not used in their orchards. The fair crop secured by Clark was soM readily on the local market at a good price which represented a seasonal profit instead of the loss experienced by the owners of non-producing orchards. The problem of securing bees for orchard pollination has been solved in various ways by orchardists throughout the United States. The first undertaking was to rent colonies of bees from beekeepers with - in or nearby the orchard area. This procedure was somewhat difficult in some of the sections and records indicate the movement of bees as much as 40 miles in New Jersey, as much as 50 miles in Michigan and equal distance in New York state. There was a period in this development of bees for orchard pollination when there was the need for securing bees even at considerable distance and expense to the orchardist. The next step was the attempt made by a few extensive orchard </seg>
         <seg id="p565">Nebraska State Horticulture Society companies. There is one notable example in Illinois of an orchard company hiring a professional beekeeper to operate the required num - ber of colonies for orchard pollination and to continue the operation of these colonies in adjacent territory throughout the season for honey production. The honey production operations were associated with the orchard management, but were in reality only correlated rather an independent organization. The results which have been obtained by this procedure have been satisfactory under these conditions. The or - chard was extensive enough to require sufficient colonies to justify the hiring of a professional beekeeper. Such a procedure insured an ample supply of good quality of bees for this orchard. It was the chief function of the beekeeper to attend to this requirement. The honey production during the remainder of the season was to a large extent incidental to the main objective of pollination. It is possible to say that the honey producing operations have been successful and that the returns from this part of the beekeeping operations have justified the venture on the part of the orchard company. Since the returns of honey have covered the expenses of operation, the services of the bees for pollination pur - poses have been secured, but no direct outlay in cash. It is true that such a set-up is not commonly available and therefore there are few orchardists who are.in a position to control their supply of bees to the certainty of ownership. It seems quite probable that a few orchardists are justified in such a: program. The average orchardist is then confronted with the problem of securing bees to the best advantage. The first approach to this problem is to contact some producer in or close to the territory who may be relied upon to supply the required number of good colonies of bees at the appropriate time for pollination purposes. This can be done in most instances, although it is more difficult just now after a period of some five years of disastrous beekeeping conditions than it was prior to that period. '¦'.¦¦. -v ..¦:•'': . It is interesting to note a proposed development which took place early in this program of using bees for orchard pollination. There are a large number of people in the south who make their living by supplying what is called package bees. These bees are sold by the pound to the honey producer for use in.producing honey throughout the northern regions. This item of commerce has become quite important in the lives of a good many individuals in the south and in the honey industry of the north. The three-pound package is the common article of commerce for honey producers. The. package shippers immediately saw a possible means of increasing the use of their article of commerce and began a campaign for the use of package bees for orchard pollination. The three-pound package was the one then known, so was naturally the one recommended for orchard use. It soon became evident, however, that this item was not giving the desired results. In other words the pollination value of the three-pound package was not equal to that of a </seg>
         <seg id="p566">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture good over-wintered colony. The next step in the evolution was for the package shipper to develop a special orchard package which was made up of 5 pounds of bees. The orchardist was advised to secure this pack - age, wrap each package separately and to distribute them throughout the orchard as has been the practice with fully established colonies. This type of package was more effective for pollination purposes than the three-pound package, and probably equal to a full colony. The orchardist was confronted with the problem of package disposal after the period of pollination services. When the three-pound package was used the orchardist was advised to disregard the package, perhaps destroy it in some way so as to eliminate it from the orchard. The cost of the three-pound package was quite comparable to the rental fee of a fully established colony so it was felt that the orchardist could legiti - mately destroy the bees without any material loss. The increased cost of the 5-pound package has, however, entered another factor in this program and the orchardist was very loath indeed to pay the initial price for the 5-pound package and consider the destruction of it at the end of the pollination period. This resulted in the orchardist having something on his hands that he did not know what to do with. It is probably for this reason that the 5-pound package of bees did not suc - ceed as the item of orchard pollination. We are, therefore, back to an - other approach to this problem. The orchardist in his search for bees for pollination purposes may be able to locate fully established colonies with the understanding that only first class colonies shall be used for pollination purposes and con - sidered in the rental fee. It is well recognized that mediocre colonies are of little value for pollination purposes and it has been the object to bring this to the attention of beekeepers in attempting to show them that the success of this cooperative arrangement between honey pro - ducers and orchardists is dependent to a large extent upon the quality of the product which the honey producer is willing to furnish. In that connection it is necessary to break down any feeling between the two parties that the other one is in any way getting the outstanding advantage of a cooperative understanding. It is recognized that the orchardist may secure as much as 14 times the rental fee in the returns from his orchard through the use of bees. With this in mind the honey producers cannot be expected to rent a first class colony of overwintered bees at an exceedingly low price. It might be well to state that the price of $3.00 to $3.50 has been considered standard for this item of a first class colony of overwintered bees. On the other hand the orchardist is inclined to say that a beekeeper gets a great deal of profit through moving his colony into the orchard. An orchardist was just heard to make the remark that his beekeeper has been able to produce a lot of honey during the time his bees were in the orchard. It is easy to over-emphasize the amount of honey which </seg>
         <seg id="p567">! Nebraska State Horticulture Society is secured by these colonies during their period in the-orchard, which is only ten days. It is doubted if there is any great surplus of honey obtained, for the apple does not yield large quantities of nectar. It is true that most of the honey obtained at this, time is used directly for brood rearing which is another way of saying "colony development" and it is valuable to that extent. ¦¦".¦'.. It is interesting and difficult to explain why there are colonies so badly disrupted in this moving process. It is true, however, that bees which have been used for orchard pollination purposes seem to de - teriorate faster than those which are not moved. The first item is a heavy loss of queens which we cannot explain but it is a fact that exists, so that.when the beekeeper collects, his rental fee of $3.50 per colony it does not much more than cover the possible loss. If a hive should be broken in the moving process it means that the margin of profit has been reduced. In other words it is a pure gamble and if his moving is a success he stands to make a few dollars; if he has bad luck he stands to lose a few dollars. Year in and year out the honey producer does not realize big net returns from the rental fees on his bees. So it must be understood that any cooperative approach is for the good of all con - cerned and not for the good of either party. The next proposal is one which seems logical as a result of the demonstration work conducted In lowa. It may not always be possible to arrange for a sufficient supply of high grade colonies for pollination purposes. The next alternative is to resort to package bees, but im - mediately the orchardist shys because he does not know anything about handling bees and it would seem that the happy solution of this problem would depend upon a cooperative arrangement between the honey producer and the orchardist. The orchardist must have bees and most of the honey producers, especially at the present time, are in dire, need of a few more colonies of bees. Therefore, it seems only logical that some arrangement should be developed between the two parties for the mutual benefit.of each.; The suggestion is made that the orchardist plan to provide the cost of three-pound packages of bees, which may in fact be ordered by the honey producer. These bees are to be received and managed by the cooperating beekeeper. The package should be installed on fully drawn combs containing some honey and some pollen by the beekeeper. It is necessary to emphasize the equipment which should be provided by the beekeeper for it is recognized that a three - pound package of bees. installed on foundation is not ;of sufficient polli - nation value to the orchardist to justify the arrangement. The pollina - tion value of over-wintered colonies, 3-pound packages on combs, 5-pound packages on foundation, 3-pound packages on foundation is fairly well standardized. The three-pound package of bees should be received at least 10 days prior to the probable bloom period, which date has been established when the packages are ordered in January. This early order date is necessary to insure exact delivery date. This permits the pack- </seg>
         <seg id="p568">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture age to become fully established and really active, and with a high polli - nation value by the time the bloom period begins. The actual installation may take place in the orchard or outside of the orchard preparatory to moving in at the appropriate time. The packages were installed in the orchard in the demonstration conducted with Mr. Clark. This eliminated any possible loss of colony effort through the process of moving which is an item that was mentioned in connection with fully established combs. This package should be managed to the best ability of the producer prior to the bloom period so it may reach its optimum value for pollination services. It should be handled to the best advantage during the bloom period and should be removed at the end of the bloom period so as to do away with any possible overlapping of interest after that time. This arrangement calls for the cost of the package up to ?3.50 to be taken care of by the orchardist as payment of the management of these packages with the stipulated equipment. The package becomes the property of the beekeeper after it has served its purpose for orchard pollination. It would seem that such a plan of cooperation holds definite advantages for each of the respective cooperators and holds no particular disadvantage for either of the cooperators. It is recognized that there are obligations to be fulfilled by each of the cooperating par - ties and the success of this cooperative agreement depends entirely upon the acceptance and fulfillment of the responsibility of each party. It is possible by this agreement for the orchardist to get the maximum of pollination value for the minimum of expenditure of money and time. This agreement relieves the orchardist of any managerial re - quirement whatsoever in connection with the installation, management and disposition of the bees after the bloom period. It also would probably develop a cooperation which should be improved from year to year The necessity for purchasing package bees might be reduced as the seasons pass, through the building up of good over-wintered colonies in the hands of the cooperating producer. A producer would be encouraged to increase his supply of good over-wintered colonies if he knew they would be required for orchard pollination. There has been fear expressed as a result of unfortunate circum - stances of having bees in the orchard prior to the bloom period on ac - count of spray schedules and likewise after the bloom period. The cluster spray is usually applied prior to the bloom period and immedi - ately following the bloom period the first arsenical spray for codling moth control is applied. The demonstration referred to above aimed to secure information on this possible difficulty. The packages were installed ten days prior to bloom period in the orchard, while the cluster spray was being ap - plied. The colonies and established packages were left in the orchard for a period of ten days after bloom period during which time the first </seg>
         <seg id="p569">Nebhaska State Horticulture Society arsenical spray was applied. Part of the routine of this preparation was to place a water vessel in the form of a coffee can immediately adjacent to each package or colony. This water was slightly salted at the rate of 1 tablespoonful of salt to a gallon of water. It is known that salty water is more attractive to bees than is plain water. These water - ing vessels were kept supplied with water as a routine matter of man - agement throughout the time that the bees were in the orchard. The bees had an opportunity to establish themselves at these drinking places and therefore found no necessity for going greater distances for the water supply demanded by the hive activities. There was never any evidence that the bees were attempting to collect water after the appli - cation of a spray. It seems quite evident from demonstrations con - ducted over a period of a good many years that the bees are not seeking poison, but are seeking the water which is available in the spray. The collection of poison is incidental to this process. It would seem then that the establishment of a small water vessel at each colony unit is a matter of insurance to prevent any difficulty from this overlapping of interests, the presence of bees and the spraying of trees. The bee units should be distributed through the orchard at the rate of one: colony per acre for old orchards and one. colony per two acres for young orchards. The units may be placed between the trees in the row in such a manner that they will not interfere with the easy passage of the sprayer. It is not well to place the units so far under the branches of the trees that it will be difficult to manipulate them during the or - chard period. Some prefer to locate the unit under the southeast por - tion of the tree, especially if the prevailing wind.is from the northwest. It may be advisable to distribute heavier along the west and north portions of the orchard if the prevailing wind is from the northwest. The entrance of the hive should be south or east and out from the tree. The demonstration included the colony records of honey produc - tion, on the over-wintered colonies moved out of the orchard and the honey production of the packages moved 45 miles to a honey producing section for the remainder of the season. The results at the end of the year indicated a normal production from both types of units and the normal number of colonies went into winter fully established and preparatory to use the next season. It may be necessary to summarize this lengthy discussion. There is a need for bees in the pollination of orchards. Results indicate that old orchards will bear better, shy bearing varieties will be improved materially, young orchards can be encouraged to bear at an earlier age. Bees may be secured from a beekeeper in the neighborhood, but it is understood that only good first class colonies of bees are of value for pollination purposes. Where it is not possible to secure the requisite number of good colonies of beas it is advisable to consider a cooperative arrangement with the beekeepers. This arrangement provides for the </seg>
         <seg id="p570">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture purchase of a 3-pound package of bees by the orchardist. The installa - tion and management of the package of bees on the specification of good equipment including drawn combs containing some honey and some pollen is made by the beekeeper. Further provision is necessary in the establishment of watering places as soon as the bees are put in the orchard. There is no reason why such a cooperative arrangement can - not be highly satisfactory to both cooperating parties when the full responsibility is accepted by each party. It must be thoroughly under - stood that all of the advantage is not with one party but that the ad - vantages are equal to both parties. It is possible to continue this co - operation in anticipation of succeeding years of need for bees. I have said that horticulturists should not take up honey pro - ducing as a sideline. Sometimes large orchards maintain an apiary but also maintain a manager for it. Both the orchard and the apiary need attention. I wanted to get over one thing and that is that the solution of this problem is not for the orchardist to become a beekeeper but to cooperate with the established beekeeper from which both could benefit. A lot of good successful fruit stands sell honey along with their fruit. I know that the cooperation in the matter of pollination need not begin there or end there but in any cooperative agreement there must be an honest understanding and an appreciation that one side isn't getting all the benefits and the other all the disadvantages. Both gain and both lose. Until you enter on that basis, you are not going to succeed. » » * Q. Would you tell us how to distribute those bees? A. One co'ony to an acre in an old orchard, one colony to l._ acres in a young one. Q. Would there be any loss of bees with spray getting on dande - lions? A. We didn't happen to have any dandelions but that is a problem. You must get the dandelions out of your orchard, if at all possible. Q. Do peach trees have to be pollinated? A. The new Hale does, most others do not. Q. Is there such a thing as a stingless bee? A. Yes, there is one in Mexico but it does not make honey. In New Jersey there is a variety but I do not know about their honey making or pollinating qualities. The Italian bee which was developed for us was rather delicate and we are going back to the black bee which </seg>
         <seg id="p571">Nebraska State Horticulture Society is a very hardy type and the Caucasian which will fly in lower tem - peratures. MRS. C. A. LORD: Is there a bee that will work in rainy weather? MR. PADDOCK: No. In fact, bees are the best indicators of weather. Different bees work differently in different temperatures but none work in rainy weather. DEARLE BAKER: I would like to add a word or two in this connection; There are some very good bulletins that are available on this subject from this college and from the lowa State College. I believe it is worth while to go into this matter, because this seems to be one phase of orchard practice where a lot of us have failed. This year I took ten stands of bees and put them in a Gano block. I left them five days. Then the Winesap began to bloom and the bees' were transferred to the Winesap orchard two miles away during the night. The next day I noticed a lot of activity but they didn't seem to be going to the trees very much. The second day, they were very active. A good crop of apples was set on that orchard and I felt that the pollen they had on their bodies, in their hives, and on their run - ways was responsible for that Winesap crop. • I agree that we should cooperate with the beekeepers in our own community. A great many of the growers are already doing it. It was very interesting to me to get this slant that the orchardist has no place in the bee keeping business. We will now hear from Darrel Hill, Orchard Foreman here at the College, on "There is a Growing Demand for Good Cider" and then we will finish the morning with our discussion on marketing problems. Mr. Hill. '-;.- : ¦.-¦¦'¦• THERE IS A GROWING DEMAND FOR GOOD CIDER Webster's Dictionary states that the word cider is possibly derived from the Hebrew word shekfir which means strong drink. Now too often the cider as purchased by the consuming pubic is strong drink. Sometimes it is strong because of the presence of benzoate of soda or other adulterant added as a preservative. Often it is strong—with emphatic reference as to taste and aroma due to the inferior quality of the fruit from which it was pressed. There will never be a demand for cider of this kind. Our experience has been that once a buyer tastes a fresh blended cider with that inviting fruity flavor, be imme - diately recognizes the quality and is a prospective Tegular customer, often placing repeat orders time and again, Now if the buyers can be assured that they are drinking a product that is made from sound clean fruit and it has an appealing fruity </seg>
         <seg id="p572">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture flavor and aroma, the demand is automatically created because there are very few individuals to whom good cider does not appeal. Qualifications for Good Cider Good cider means a product that will please the consumer's sense of taste—this is flavor,—of smell—this is aroma,—and also a certain amount of attractiveness to the eye. A number of factors are instru - mental in accomplishing these results. The cider should be made from sound, clean fruit. It probably should have a natural appearance. Also it should have a fresh fruit flavor and aroma. This means it should be placed on the market in an unfermented and unadulterated condition. Here adulteration refers to the addition of water or pre - servatives of any kind. In this modern age most people are very skeptical of any food product that contains a preservative, so a very important part in the marketing of cider is to place it on sale as a fresh product. Here refrigeration facilities are valuable as it has been demonstrated that cider can be kept for at least a period of two years at a temperature of 10° to 15° F. without losing its aroma, flavor or color. (Fabian C.B No. 98, Mich. State College). Also i. may be pasteurized by the flash method and retain these qualities if it is cooled immediately after heating. One local retailer advertises this kind of cider as "nothing is added, nothing is taken away." Blending An important factor in obtaining flavor is to have the proper balance of sweetness, acidity and aroma. This is accomplished by means of blending. The Importance of Blending By the very simple method of tasting different samples of the individual varieties of apples that we grow here in Nebraska, one will realize that each variety has certain qualities with respect to the teste it will impart to cider. There is no doubt but that certain varie - ties make better cider than others. Summer apples make a very poor cider, fall varieties are more desirable, while winter sorts make the best product. Sweet apples make a fair grade of cider bm: keeping quality is lacking. This is because of their chemical com - position. An interesting point here is that sweet apples very often do not contain as much sugar as the sour apples. Their sweet taste is not due to the presence of excess sugars but is accounted for by the absence of acid. The acid content of apples is usually malic acid and occasionally some citric acid is present. This explains why the cider </seg>
         <seg id="p573">Nebraska State Horticulture Society from sweet apples will spoil and also one reason why the acid con - tent of cider is important as it retards the growth of spoilage micro organisms, such as bacteria, etc. The German people who are famous \ for making good cider rank the value of varieties with respect to their content (1) sugars, (2) acid, (3) tannin. Our commercial varieties of apples as grown here usually do not contain these constituents in the correct propor - tions so as to produce a cider of highest flavor. So we must resort to the blending of two or more varieties, always seeking to obtain a cider that has. "character." That is it should have a marked agree - able, fruity flavor and aroma, not flat and insipid but be moderately tart to the teste due to an optimum acid content. Our popular varieties may be classed approximately as follows: Acid Sub-acid to Ajromatie Astringent Neutral Duchess mild ! Red Delicious Crab apples Ben Davis Yellow Traps- Jonathan Golden Deli-Many peed- Gano parent Wealthy :/[.:-. cious . lings Black Ben Mlaiden Blush King David Va. Beauty Mo. Pippin Wolf River N. W.

Pippin under the neutral or insipid flavor group but this apple as grown here pro - duces a cider somewhat astringent and with a mild medicine taste, probably due to presence of considerable tannin. This difference may be accounted for by variations of growing conditions as found here and in the east. • The blending of cider! is very important, but it need not be a complicated process. Here we usually mix the apple varieties as they are fed into the grater of the mill by feeding the different kinds alter - nately one bushel at a time, usually mixing 4 or 5 varieties in each run of cider. Haying a choice of Golden -Delicious, Red Delicious and Va. Beauty for aroma. Jonathan, King David, Wealthy, York Im - perial and others of group 2 to supply the "tang" for acid balance and also to give body. Moj Pippin is our main stronghold for adding a mild astringent factor. Apples:that have dropped before maturity and also fruits that do not have enough color for sale as dessert apple 3 are valuable for toning down the exceptional sweet taste of cider that is made from over ripe Grimes Golden or frozen apples of certain varieties. </seg>
         <seg id="p574">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Practically all varieties can be used in some combination so as to produce a cider that has desirable characteristics with regard to tartness, body, aroma, flavor and other factors that contribute to pleasing th:' consumer's palate. Profit Is there a profit in making good cider? Several things should be considered here—the value of the apples before pressing, yield in gallons per bushel, costs of production as labor, power, etc., and re - turns for finished product. There is no doubt but that cider making is a messy, somewhat disagreeable job. Also it means a moderate investment for equipment, but by this method it is possible to economi - cally market the otherwise unprofitable grades of fruit at a decided advantage. Especially is this true if the fact is considered that they are kept off' of the market as competition for the better grades of fruit. This year the Horticulture Department decided to pack and market only the top grade of apples. This decision meant that we were con - fronted with the problem of disposing of about 3000 bushels of off grade fruit. Making these apples into cider seemed the best method of disposal because experience early in the season had proven that we were justified in expecting a fair yield in gallons of cider per bushel and as one local grocery store had sold more than 300 gallons of cider durng one week we were confident of a demand by the con - sumers. These 3000 bushels of apples consisted of small sizes, under 2'_, inches in size, a large per cent of these were perfectly sound and well colored. Also many drops and a large quantity of badly cracked Stayman Winesap. These Stay man Winesap have stood up quite well in common storage and are very good for cider making pur - poses. Ordinarily all apples under 24 inches in size, all those mechanically injured, such as hail injury, limb rub, stem puncture, etc., all off colored fruits and also all drops have very little value on the market. These apples will make excellent blended cider if they are sound otherwise. The main factors here are that they do not contain wet rot and that drops have not remained on the ground long enough to absorb certain earthy odors. Now just what would be the value of these grades of apples if they were forced on the market to sell by the bushel? Thousands of bushels of apples have been sold on the Lincoln market this year at retail prices of from 29c to ?1.00 per bushel. These prices often include a container, packing and delivery costs, besides a profit for the dealer. Last week I observed Black Twig apples that were selling retail for 59c per bushel basket. These apples were ring packed in new </seg>
         <seg id="p575">Nebraska State Horticulture Society baskets. They were poorly colored and rather small, about 2.4" to 2%" in size. This selling price included the following costs:—New basket and lid, paper (as liner and cap), packing cost, delivery cost, retailers Jrofit. The producer could not have received very much for growing these apples. Another sad part of this story is that the customer who buys these apples will be disappointed because of their inferior quality and size. How much better for all concerned if these grades of apples were combined with other varieties and made into a good blended ¦¦cider. 7 We have run tests on several varieties of apples to determine the yields in gallons per. bushel. Data were recorded on apples pressed at different stages of maturity with the idea of checking op the loss in yield due to ripening of fruit in storage. That is, tests were made on hard ripe* j market ripe, and over ripe fruit. Com - parisons were also made on yield and taste of cider from apples before and after being frozen. . . The following table shows the yield for some common varieties: Yield gallons per 100 bu.' Hard Market Over Variety ! -ripe. . • ; ripe ripe. Winesap ; 1.380 . 370 Black Twig 7 7,350 -. 346 Mo.

RABEN: Does the color of the apple have anything to do with the flavor of the cider? - \ MS. HILL: In this way, a poorly colored apple is generally un - developed and of poorer quality. QUESTION: What about the peel? Is there any difference in flavor between peeled and unpeeled? MR. HILL: Not a great deal. There may be a little because the volatile oils that give flavor to fruit are concentrated in the skin and directly under it. QUESTION: How do you keep the cider from fermenting? ANSWER: We attempt to market it as quickly as possible after making it, rather than using a preservative. We feel that it is better to use cold storage facilities (10° to 15°) and market it as a pure product. Buyers are skeptical of preservatives. QUESTION: Won't it freeze at that temperature? MR. HILL: Yes, a little but not enough to break the con - tainer; neither is the quality of the cider changed. QUESTION: How about keeping it at apple storage temperatures? ANSWER: It will keep very well. We have kept some at 40° for several weeks and I think it is all right. We will let you sample i* a little later and you can judge for yourself. QUESTION: What do you do with the pulp? MR. HILL: We haven't used it at all but the Washington State Experiment Station finds that it makes good ensilage or it may be dried and sold to the pectin manufacturers. </seg>

The cider from frozen apples is noticeably sweeter than cider from unfrozen apples of the same variety. DEARLE BAKER: We are ready now to take up the discussion "Can Our Marketing Program Be Improved?" Before we get into that, I would like to point,out a few things that have taken place this past year that point toward the fact that the outlets or the stores that are selling fruits and apples are willing to cooperate to the extent of spending thousands of dollars in helping to put over a campaign on apples. Can we, as Nebraska growers, disregard that help that is being offered to us by not spending the small amount of money necessary to line up with that organization? Last fall we received a letter from the National Chain Stores organization and Mr. Hoppert, Grove Porter; Stivers and myself were appointed as members .of the national committee. . I am very glad that I am a member of this national committee because "it has given me just a little different slant on the thing.. I think you will remember that several years ago in a talk before this group, I con - - demned the trucker and the chain stores as not being willing to cooperate with the Nebraska growers. lam willing to say that I was mistaken or they have changed their attitude. Nevertheless, the National Association with headquarters in Washington are the ones who have taken the forward step in putting over a campaign on this national apple movement. They put out a bulletin every iveek that sets forth the conditions of the market, the - movement of apples all over the United States, the consumption of different localities, they work up means of interesting people in apples, , get behind "National Apple Weeks" and they don't specify any par - . . ticular section. They encourage the consumption of local apples, as far as possible. In their full page newspaper ads, they encourage pictures to be used from local orchards and packing plants to create local interest. They furnish and encourage a "Farmer: to Consumer Direct" campaign; They furnish a story of some.kind dealing with the use of apples. They furnish the mats free of charge for all these ads. They also furnish to the stores large colored signs to be used in the windowsi numbers to be used in pricing and several other .',-'. aids in selling the product. They sponsored the "Big Apple" dance. Here are some of the results reported by Carroll Miller, Secretary of </seg>

An estimated minimum of 810,000 per week in advertising given by grocers to featuring apples, in their own "food-page" space, be - tween September 15th and Nov. fith; radio featuring on grocers' pro - grams not checked as yet. Grocers familiarized with Apples;—apple displaying and "push - ing"; apple varieties, to buy and to sell; possibilities of apples as a large-selling item; all through the first definite, planned work with apples ever inaugurated among Organized Grocers. Permanent bene - fits of this are large. At least 50,000 grocery stores actively working en Apples, including largest volume stores principally. Many, many families introduced to or made accustomed to apples as a daily menu item by this "pushing" by the grocers, thus expanding noticeably the future apple market. This was a notable result of the Grape-fruit Campaign by the Organized Grocers last season; will hold as well for apples beyond a doubt as a permanent gain. General reports as summarized at headquarters of National Asso - ciation of Food Chains, 72G Jackson Place, Washington, D. C. (Mr. John A. Logan) indicate; —Middle Atlantic region Chains, apple sales up 61 rr from Sept. 1 through Nov. G, over same period last year; </seg>
         <seg id="p579">:... 'I- ¦!!¦!¦¦'¦! 7. ' 7 Nebraska State Horticulture Society for North Central States, up 50% Sept. 15-Oct. 15 over same period in 1936. AJong with the advertising and promotional work of the various apple advertising associations, the National Campaign of the Organized Grocers must be given a large and generous amount of credit for the established fact that THE ACCEPTANCE (PURCHASE) OF APPLES BY THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THE LAR - GEST IN RECORDED APPLE HISTORY. This report comes to us unanimously, from all sources' over the nation; —that the public are buying more apples more freely than ever before. This is corroborated by the fact that the national apple crop this year was 33 million bushels larger than the 1935 crop, but that cold storage holdings on December 1 were only about 4 percent larger than in 1935. SOMETHING HAP - PENED TO THAT OTHER 29 MILLION BUSHELS. Some wasted, of course; but mainly they were used by the public. Further, the price level for apples has been almost exactly the same or slightly stronger for. the present season to date (Dec. 20, 1937) than for the 1935 season; although the 33-million bushel larger crop (211 million bushels, total, against 178 million in '35) normally would have carried a price-level much lower. Nor should it be overlooked that the various regional apple advertising associations of the nation secured this National Apple Campaign; organized it and carried it through from the apple growers' side. Carroll R. Miller, Chairman Pro Tern 7;. : ~ : NATIONAL APPLE GROWERS; Martinsburg, W. Va. ' It takes money to distribute these things and they are available to an individual or to an assocaition. I feel that the work that is being done by this National Organization is making a perfect set-up for any group, of apple growers but we have to go back to the stumbling block here in our own state that we don't have a uniform grade law. It is entirely up to us as growers to work this out and try to get the cooperation of all growers in sponsoring some law so that we can get equal value for ourj apples. Take Golden Delicious that are selling for $1.65 or $1.75 now. I know of a lot of Golden Delicious apples equally as good that sold this fall from 25c to 50c a bushel. Take the Winesap. The price varies on it say from $1.15 down to 75c, same quality of apple, same pack and grown right here in Nebraska. How much longer can we continue in business under the present set-up? The buying public and the wholesaler are taking advantage of our weakness. ' We know how to grow apples, we know how to pack them and make displays but we don't seem to know how to sell them. I am hoping that while I am president of this society we can put over </seg>
         <seg id="p580">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture some kind of a grade law. That has been a hobby of mine for a long time. We tried a few years ago, with representatives from lowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Kansas, to do this very thing. Kansas put their bill across. lowa has a law, Missouri has a provision that keeps out undesirable apples. Nebraska has no such law and is a dumping ground for cheap cider and canning apples. New York passed a law that no fruit or vegetable can come into their state unless it conforms to a U. S. Grade. We had such a bill up to the third reading here during the last session of the unicameral and what happened? From lack of interest, we let two or thre-3 growers kill the bill. There are men in this room who have worked hard and put in lots of time working out a bill. Now, are we as a Society going to permit a few small growers who do not care to cooperate or take any part in the Society to dictate the policies of an organization and industry? I am just sorry that we don't have a session of the legislature this winter. I'd like to battle this thing out. The Otoe Food Products Company at Nebraska City are interested enough to try to work out a plan with Nebraska apple growers to use the lower grade apples in canning. They are in the canning business and are an outlet for fruits and vegetables. They have experimented with baked apples and have found one that will appeal to the con - sumer in this territory. They use a label "Oven Baked Apples". They are cooperating by using the lower grade apples and, if we are willing to cooperate, they will put up a canned apple juice to be sold as beer is sold now, in cans. That will help to keep the smaller, undesirable apples off the fresh fruit market. MR. HOPPERT: We saw prices stay low this fall because there was a lot of this low grade stuff glutting the market. A lot of our people out in the state see only this poor stuff because that is all the peddler will handle. A man from the western part of the state _sked to see the kind of fruit we could grow. A trucker was selling low grade apples through that part of the state and giving the impression that they are top quality. QUESTION: Where would the poor man get his apples if they all sold for $1.95 a bushel? MR. HOPPERT: He pays nearly as much for the poorer quality. That's the pity. The trucker makes the profit. D. BAKER: The utility grade would be sold for the same price probably as the lower grades sell for now. In this grade law, what is known as a "deceptive pack" would not be allowed, large apples on top and smaller ones below. It is possible to buy apples in bulk, a few large ones but mostly small. The small ones are put in the </seg>
         <seg id="p581">Nebraska State Horticulture Society bottom of the.i.-basket and the better ones on top and they are sold as all big apples. I believe that the wholesaler and the buying public are doing their best to get away from such a thing. . W. B. BANNING: The trouble with trying to put over such a law is that the growers are so few and representatives from other parts of the state will say, "These few growers want their fruit put up in such a way that the consumer must pay more for it." The grower is to blame to some, degree for this deceptive pack business. When he sells these small apples to the trucker, he must know what will be done with them. A merchant in my town had Golden Delicious tor sale at 89c. Considering the cost of the basket, the liner, drayage, storage charges and all, there wasn't much profit on that apple. They were small, of course. No packer should pack such an apple and put it on the market to compete with his good stuff later. The growers are to blame for that. If every grower would put his name and the size of the apple on the pack, then he would get some credit with the purchaser. • '"; - -• As long as these truckers pack these apples as they do, your article is going to be discredited on the market. Even wormy apples are shipped in from other states. If we get a law as the other states have, we will sell on the basis of quality and it would put a stop to such practices. I would like to see this law revived and put over but it can't be done unless you get some steam back of it. I have had truckers come and ask to buy 100 bushels of 2.4 inch apples and 25 or 30 bushels of 2% inch apples. I couldn't control what he did with them, if I sold them to him. Those apples would be sold for first class apples. Such practices are what we must break up 7 I just tell the truckers I don't care to sell these low grade apple 3. They should be used for cider. MR, HOPPERT: I believe we should have a. continuance of our efforts on this law. I think some of the other growers should support it too. !.' - ; ¦'' ¦ !7 .. ¦-' ;¦ "• W. B. BANNING: I wonder if we could get some of these small growers into a meeting sometime, and make them see things as we do. Is there any way we can use some persuasion on them? .R, KIMMEL: We tried holding hands with them several times but it didn't work. PRANK SIM: I don't think it was the small growers that beat 1 that bill but.the wholesalers. - D. BAKER: After the opposition signed a paper agreeing to the </seg>
         <seg id="p582">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture amendments, then the bill went to the Attorney General's office and came back with certain recommendations, taking out some of our clauses and putting in others. The opposition thought that relieved them of their agreement and obligation because they didn't have time to go over the bill and understand the changes. It got down to the dead line and it had to go through as it was or as it was before the amendments were added. The last I heard of it, the bill was shelved rather than have it come up on the floor for de - bate. Whose fault it was, I don't know but I don't feel that lam whipped yet and the Society should get busy and put this thing over. MR. SHUBERT: I thought I wouldn't get into this but I believe it is time somebody did. I don't believe it will do a bit of good to discuss this bill at the present time for the legislature won't meet for another year anyway. I think, as has been said, we should wait until the time is right, then have someone on the ground to take care of this bill. Get these growers together and get them to agree to this thing. They talk among themselves and are a little envious of the larger grower. I believe we should continue the committee that had the bill in charge before and make any necessary additions later on when the time comes and, last but not least, we should provide a fund for someone to steer that bill through the legislature. Expenses of living here while the bill is being passed amount to something. Senator Banning would be an ideal person to do this very thing. MR. MARSHALL: I move that the committee on the uniform grade law be continued and all effort made to try to work out some agree - ment. Motion seconded and carried. MR. BANNING: I believe that with a little pressure, we could shut down on this stuff coming in. In 1936, when ports of entry - were first established, we shut down on a lot of it. Under the pure food and drug act, we might be able to do something. D. BAKER: While the deal this fall is still fresh in their minds, we could hold meetings with these growers having general discussion of what happened this year and some of us could point out where they fell down and how we could cooperate. Then this fall go to the Pure Food Department and ask them for their cooperation. They are willing to cooperate, as Mr. Willard said. Follow that up and have them set up rules and regulations which give them authority to set up certain grade requirements. If pressure is brought to bear, I believe we are taking the first step toward getting the law two years from now. </seg>
         <seg id="p583">Nebraska State Horticulture Society .'-¦' R. KIMMEL: I think you are right in tackling the problem right away. In the event we had a short crop this coming year with a good price, they might forget all about this year. DEARLE BAKER: This closes our meetings for the year and I am sure you will all agree that they have been both valuable and in - teresting. We shall look forward to seeing all of you next year.

         <seg id="p591">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association Professor Gramlich of the Animal Husbandry Department made a motion that Senator Cady of Fremont go to the State Board of Agriculture and attempt to get a larger appropriation for the Breeders Association inasmuch as the Breeders receive-only about a fourth as much as some of the other associations and live stock business is by far the most im - portant business in the state. This motion was seconded by Dr. Cady. Carried.

M.A.ALEXANDER i One of the most common roughages used in sheep rations in this ' part of Nebraska during the last few years has been silage made from corn or the sorghums. If silage made from either of the plants is to be fed to a flock of ewes that are to produce lambs, some care should be taken in the ambunts fed. Up until about 6 or 8 weeks before lambing time the ewe may be fed practically all the silage she will eat provided it is supplemented with a protein supplement and a mineral. About 6 to 8 weeks before lambing time the allowance of silage should be materially reduced arid replaced by one-half pound of grain and some good quality alfalfa hay. This will materially reduce the bulkiness of the ration which will prevent the dropping of premature lambs. The amount ,of protein supplement which can be fed, like cotton - ]-. seed meal, linseed meal, corn gluten meal or soybean meal, is approxi- I matey one-fourth of a pound daily per ewe if the ewes are receiving no. legume hay. |If some legume hay is fed, probably one-fifth of .a </seg>

A good mineral would be either ground steamed bone meal or ground limestone. This may be fed at the rate of about 1 pound daily to every 30 to 35 ewes. If the silage is cut a little finer than it is ordinarily processed for cattle, it will be cleaned up better by sheep. If a sorghum is used for making silage, it would usually cut a little finer than corn silage and is frequently cleaned up a little better by sheep than ordinary corn silage. Any of the legume hays are an excellent feed for sheep but alfalfa is the standard for all comparisons. Roughages such as straw can be used in a limited way but they should not make up a large part of the ration. Any of the grasses that can be grown for pasture will be consumed readily by sheep. It is not entirely correct to expect sheep to clean a pasture of its weeds. It is probably true that sheep will eat approxi - mately 90 per cent of the common weeds but this does not mean that </seg>
         <seg id="p595">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association they prefer them to a good grass. If other feed is not available, sheep will naturally eat the weeds. In a pasture mixture of brome grass and alfalfa planted in the fall of 1936 and pastured in the late spring and early summer of 1937, sheep ate the brome grass first, then the alfalfa and probably would have eaten a few of the weeds but in order to pro - tect the brome and alfalfa, the sheep had to be removed before the weeds were consumed. It would seem better not to expect sheep to be a cure-all for the limitation of weeds in pastures or to expect them to keep the weeds down while our Nebraska pastures are recuperating from the drought. A far better practice would be not to overgraze the pastures and to use better tested methods for controlling weeds in the pasture: &lt; There is no animal that will respond to good feeding like a sheep. Many of our farm flock producers will find it to their advantage to let their ewes utilize the pasture during the summer time rather than to carry the lambs through the hot summer on pasture. Lambs for many farmers will return a greater net profit if they are marketed by the first of June. The older sheep can better utilize summer pasture than a lamb that is expected to be fattened on the pasture. WINTERING STOCKERS COMMERCIALLY | . RAY R. THALMAN Since its very beginning Nebraska has been primarily interested in the production of live stock. True, there have been periods in which grain and hay production have had the spotlight but always they have soon taken a back seat to live stock. We are now in the middle of one of these back to animal husbandry movements. In my opinion, this recent trend is the most permanent of any that has ever taken place. Why? First, we have exploited our soil resources to the limit and it has dawned upon us that a soil conservation policy is in order—and there can be no soil conservation program of any magnitude or importance without a live stock program. Second, live stock must furnish the market or outlet for the pasture, the hay, and the grain grown upon Nebraska farms: Third, our present live stock program as it is now being developed is one that is fitted to the state, the locality and to the farm. -It is a more conservative, and better balanced program than has been known in the past. The objectives are several, to conserve and rebuild the soil, to use most efficiently the produce of the farm, and to furnish an income, though possibly not as large in all cases, but one far more sure and with less risk than those of the past. In developing this new live stock program for Nebraska, adapta - bility has been one of the major considerations. Eastern Nebraska recognizes that their program must differ from that of the sandhills; </seg>
         <seg id="p596">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture that southern Nebraska must use live stock differently than either eastern or western Nebraska. Developing a live stock program has been most difficult in those areas formerly known as grain farming districts. This has been especial - ly true where there are numerous tenant farms. The reasons are several, first the lack of capital on the part of the tenant, short term contracts, lack of buildings and equipment, lack of pasture, and our share or cash leasing system. While it can be fitted to a wide variety of conditions the wintering of stockers seems especially well suited to the tenant farm or the grain section farmer. I believe that Mr. Tolman had in mind this area when he assigned me the topic, Wintering Stock - ers Commercially. While this is a little off the subject possibly one of the most urgent needs at this time in developing a live stock program is a change in the landlord-tenant relationship. Longtime contracts with carefully selected tenants must eventually come into existence, if any live stock or soil buildinj. or maintenance program is to succeed. Whether or not we should pattern it after the English system I do not know, but at least that system has made the farming business in the English coun - tries a stable and successful business and, incidentally, live stock has been the "hub" of the farming business in those countries. Both tenant and landlord have on the whole profited and the productivity of the soil has been maintained or rebuilt. With a leasing system of this kind in Nebraska, a live stock program involving a cow herd, baby beef pro - duction, and many other types of animal husbandry could and would come into being. Under our present system the tenant farmer is usually limited to a relatively short time live stock program that involves a minimum of capital. Not infrequently he must also get rid of a large share of his live stock before the farming season opens up or at least gets into full swing. The fact that wintering stockers enables the farmer to rid himself of their care when spring work comes on is one of the reasons it fits into his program so well. It also gainfully employs him during the winter months and at the same time makes a market for the rough - age produced and which frequently has little cash market value. The principal requirement for wintering stock cattle is an abundance of roughage. All through the southern part of the state and in many sections of eastern Nebraska, crop failures so far as grain is concerned, are not infrequent. Most of this land could be planted to sorghums of the forage variety which resist drouth, and the roughage used to feed cattle through the winter. There has always been and probably always will be a rather brisk demand for good feeders and stacker cattle during the spring months. The price is usually somewhat higher than at any other season on this class of cattle. Calves, and in some cases yearlings, can be purchased in the fall, wintered, and sold in the spring or fattened </seg>
         <seg id="p597">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association if grain is available, with a minimum of financial risk because of the low margin required to pay for the feed consumed and because there is seldom a decrease in the market value of this kind of cattle; In the South Platte areas the average farm will produce some 5 to 6 tons of corn silage or 6.t0 8 tons of Atlas silage per acre. Two to 2% tons of silage plus % ton of alfalfa hay will feed one calf a period of five months and produce a minimum of 225 pounds of gain. In the case of a yearling it will take approximately 1 more ton of silage to feed this animal the same length of time and should get in return another 50 pounds of gain. In other words, a yearling which consumed 3% tons of silage plus the necessary amount of supplement should gain approximately 275 pounds in this 5-month period. If a 400-pound calf is purchased at weaning time for 8. per pound and sold in the spring at the same price, this calf would pay $15 per ton for the hay he consumed and $5.60 per ton for the silage consumed. Using the South Platte area as an example the calf should pay around $31.00 per acre for the feed which he consumed during the winter months. Even though the silage contained no grain he would return, after paying for the supplement, around $4.00 per ton for the silage consumed. If the value of the calf increased; $1.00 during the winter, and one should expect a margin of this kind under normal conditions, he would return after paying for the supplement, $8.00 per ton for the silage consumed instead of $5.60. .&lt;;- It would seem to me that the marketing of the roughage produced on the farm at a price of this kind would be a fairly remunerative proposition for the average farmer. It must be borne: in mind that if this corn did not find its way into the silo, that approximately 70% of the tonnage produced by the corn plant would be left in the field to do very little good in the fall when the corn is shucked. If this field of corn produced 25 bushels of grain per acre, the corn would have to gross approximately $1.26 per bushel to equal the return made by calf bought at 8. and sold for 8^ after being wintered upon the silage and alfalfa ration. In discussing this, I have also in mind years in which there is very little grain production on the farm, and therefore very little income of 1 any kind unless the rOughage which has been grown but which failed to ' produce grain can be used. This feed can be put into the silo without a I great deal of expense, and when fed to stock cattle has some value. The f last four yeairs this condition has been the rule rather than the exception. Almost every year some section of the state or some acreage on the farm produces a crop that is riot especially valuable from a grain stand - '_¦¦, pointeither because of weeds, immaturity, or damage from some other cause, which if put into the silo would make very satisfactory winter I feed for live stock. </seg>
         <seg id="p598">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The advent and the common use of the trench silo has opened up a rather large field for the tenant farmer. With his own labor the trench silo can be dug and there would be no outlay of capital for a place to store his feed. The cost in harvesting the crop is relatively small and as a result the tenant farmer who has no money to invest can avail himself of a silo in which to store feed that will make a very satisfactory winter ration for stock cattle or sheep. If he has a reasonable amount of capital to invest he can purchase outright on the market a carload or more of good quality stock calves that can be carried through the winter on the feed which he has saved. Even though he should be forced to move in the spring, the calves which he has wintered can be sold to a fairly good advantage at that time. In moving he would leave no large investment in equipment or stored feed. In the event that he does not have any capital to invest, the wintering of stock calves can ___¦______! ______ _¦_¦ _¦__¦ fii_l*t-'7-; __W__)3^_____f___________i__f_____n__________________B mm m^v v_'!r-.:.. ¦Tl !?! itllfl Kfek' B. -r ____lr. 7±&lt;______y;*s_____Ms_____________WSSL ... 7____r - -.- iM______r'. li'^M^ri "-fi ______________________nfriiT*' - i._p 1 ___ ¦ ,-/f__\___i^.y_m ____¦ .-ail_a____l ___S____g_l ____ &gt;-:fl __MM l_l_i ral K.kv ¦'' K^M ¦'?-!____i!7.____j ___Mg£_ : . - &gt;3_______p-:' ..'. .^______s~f&gt; :-'i^__''l'^^'^fl___________________M __^***.

Under normal conditions the relatively low cost of the winter ration makes it possible to Winter calves profitably for the gain produced. Should he take live stock on this basis there would be very little chance of him losing money on the program. The increase which is usually expected in the price of good quality, thin cattle in the spring will under most conditions make the owner of the cattle p-aced on contract money by carrying them until spring before marketing. To be most successful, wintering stock calves involves the use of relatively good quality cattle. Feeders who handle cattle during the summer do not want, and rightly so, any cattle that cannot be made into beef grading at least low choice. The poorer kind, even though fat when, sold, come into competition with the fall run of grass fat steers from the range areas. The farmer feeders cannot compete with the range man in the production of feeder cattle, and the man who winters stockers, then pastures them on grass during the summer to I H ¦_?* I «_B W^^_H Hil;' - v__H _M __s'';-~'' &#132;Js_&gt;^_i ¦S-'t.wi «&lt;ii.-.-&lt; ¦ ______K&gt;*s|?!H.__^ H m _Pt?-;- ¦;;. t_i Mfegv-gjftS&amp;M Hfe-liM U ¦ Hfvk &gt;! iM liM^J HK: _fV'_| ¦ I WM&amp;ffimM ||S-lil ¦ ¦ H^^&gt;^%__| Bfr''- '¦K£2_____m _____ ¦ _________ ; &gt;i7 _£!_______ _____fc raoc^ zz&amp;^M \WL I BE "J lii I l_H l_____^t___l ___.«__!________[ _B |K_.

If these cattle are to be kept into the summer months and any pasture used, then the cattle must be finished on grain. Should the farmer wintering calves with the thought of selling them in the spring get caught on a bad spring market, and if he had grain to carry them on to the summer, it is quite' likely that he could make a reasonably good return by carrying them over for the fall fat cattle market. It is not unusual for this plan to be followed even by the man who sells part of his wintered cattle as feeders in the spring. CAN SORGHUM DO THE JOB OF CORN? ASA K. HEPPERLY, C. B. &amp; Q. R. R., Denver, Colo. In assigning the subject, "Can Sorghum Do the Job of Corn?" someone must have thought I was a crystal gazer with some untold power to look into the future and forecast events. This I assure you I cannot do with an accuracy which approaches anywhere near the 100% mark. Looking backward to the early part of 1934, I know now that I could not have foreseen corn crops in Nebraska of 21 million, 106 million, 26 million, and 83 million bushels for the years 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937 respectively. A four year average of only 59 mi'lion bushels compared to an average of 242 million bushels for the previous four years, nor at that time could I have foretold that in the winter of 1937 and 1938 many sound thinking Nebraska farmers from a large part of the state would be giving serious thought to some crop with which they might replace at least part of their corn acreage. The question is, "Can Sorghum Do the Job of Corn?" In analyzing this problem let us look for a moment into what has been taking place in Nebraska to our corn and sorghum acreage, review the results sorghum growers have been receiving from corn and sorghum from both a production and feeding point of view, and then I believe we can arrive at a satisfactory answer without undue star gazing. In 1930 Nebraska harvested only 12,000 acres of sorghums and increased this three times to 37,000 in 1933. Evidently the drouth of 1934 started early enough in the spring to scare a few more into planting sorghums so 74,000 acres were harvested that year. After the 1934 drouth 357,000 acres were harvested in 1935, but the acreage dropped to 136 000 acres in 1936, but increased again to 183,000 acres for this year. During this same period Nebraska corn acreage stayed near the 10 million acre mark in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, and has averaged a little over 8 million acres the last three years. The corn acreage, of course, includes all corn harvested for grain, ensilage and fodder. Since the decrease in corn, much of which has been due to the AAA and Soil Conservation Programs, has been near 2 million acres, and the sorghum acreage has increased only 170,000 acres, it cannot be said that to date sorghums </seg>
         <seg id="p601">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association have replaced an appreciable amount of corn. The rapid increase" in sorghums, however, is significant as in 1937 the acreage harvested was. 16 times larger than the acreage harvested in 1930. Should this rate of increase continue it would be but a few years until over a million acres of sorghums would be grown in the state. For the past 7 or 8 years both Kansas and Oklahoma have been raising from one to one and one-half millions acres of sorghums, and Texas for the past ten years has harvested in the neighborhood of 4 million acres each year. The most significant thing about the Nebraska sorghum acreage - figures is the big jump to 357,000 acres in 1935, and then the drop after the fairly good corn yield of 1935 to 136,0.00 acres in 1936. This means to me that in a year's time many forgot the experiences of the 1934 drouth, and were again willing to risk more of their acreage to corn. In other words, most Nebraska farmers still look at sorghum as a dry weather crop, and of course each spring at corn planting time they are optimistic, and feel that this year will be a good one for corn, so go ahead and plant their usual acreage of corn. I don't know how many years it will take to convince Nebraska farmers, particularly those living south of the Platte Hiver, that every year cannot be a good corn year, but it is probable that 1937 following the previous years of corn fail - ures has had its effect on many, ... : But why is it so many have failed to adopt a sorghum program when all factors indicate it would be to their advantage to do so. Let us consider some of the probable causes, and see what is being done to overcome them. First, I believe most farmers have not given serious, thought to the results secured with sorghums at our Experiment Sta - tions. They do not know that in good years yields of from 45 to 50 bushels of grain sorghums were received at both Lincoln and North Platte, nor have they acquainted themselves with production methods, which'are necessary for best results. Second, few realize the Ml feeding value of sorghums either as a roughage or as a gram. Third, adequate supplies of seed of recommended varieties have not been available at low prices. ['¦,'¦ During the past three years our Agricultural Extension worker* have intensified their effort to overcome these difficulties, but they have been handicapped by too many emergency programs, which have re - quired an undue portion of their time, and by unfavorable climatic conditions. To assist in the program the Agricultural Department of the Burlington Railroad furnished sorghum seed to farmers and 4-H Club members in 11936 and 1937. The results secured from the seed distributed served to increase local seed supplies of adaptable varieties, acquaint more farmers with the possibilities of sorghums, and also to further emphasize the need of a more intensified sorghum campaign for central, south central, and southwestern Nebraska. In 1936 in co - operation with County Agricultural Agents, who selected the cooperators, </seg>
         <seg id="p602">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture 60 farmers in 22 counties, were furnished enough seed for five acre plantings. Sooner Milo and Cheyenne Sweet Stalk Kafir varieties recommended by the Agronomy Department for the central, south cen - tral, and southwestern parts of the state were used. That cooperators were interested in the project is probably best shown by the fact that ."&gt;9 out of 60 cooperators mailed in reports on their crop. You all know corn was almost a complete failure in this area in 1936, and this was further emphasized from the reports of cooperators, which showed only &lt;! out of the oil reporting corn yields, and these averaged but 2.6 bushels per acre with the highest yield reported at 5 bushels per acre. On these same •"&gt;!&gt; farms where corn was a complete failure in all but 6 cases, sorghum came through with grain crops worth harvesting on 38 of them. The average yield reported was nearly 7 bushels per acre with the highest yield 2(1 bushels per acre. This year sorghum seed was furnished to 4-H Club members in 24 counties. The seed was not given directly to the Club members, but rather to the County for a revolving supply of seed for 4-H Sorghum Clubs for years to come. Each Club member, who was loaned seed from the seed pool agreed to return the same amount of seed or pay cash for the seed at the end of the season if a crop was raised. If the crop was a failure it was considered that the weather settled the account. Three varieties were used, namely, Cheyenne Sweet Stalk Kafir, Kalo and Early Kalo. Only a limited amount of Kalo seed could be secured, and it was sent to Saline. Fillmore, Nuckolls, Jefferson, Thayer and Webster Counties which later proved to be the worst drouth area in the state. Eleven Club members planting the Kalo reported crops to harvest with the highest yield of 3(1 bushels p?r acre and an average for the eleven of 1(5.8 bushels per acre. Five Club members reported no yields for harvest, but 10 out of the 16 also reported no corn for harvest, and Ihe average of the com harvested on the other six plaices was 7V_ bushels per acre. j Early Kalo seed was sent to 15 Counties, and was planted by 57 Club members. The average yield of Early Kalo for those who had grain to harvest was 12 bushels, while the average yield of corn on the same farms was ...!) bushels. The highest yield of Early Kalo reported was -10 bushels, while the highest yield of corn reported by any of the members was 30 bushels. The Cheyenne Sweet Stalk Kafir was sent to 20 counties, and was planted by 67 Club members. The Cheyenne averaged 10 bushels per acre for 59 Club members, who had grain to harvest, while 8 Club members reported Cheyenne a failure or did not mature seed for harvest. On these same farms, 67 Club members' farms, corn was a failure in 26 cases and on the remaining 41 farms, which did have corn to harvest it averaged only 4.8 bushels per acre. </seg>
         <seg id="p603">. Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association I appreciate the records. obtained from reports of farmers and Club members are not as accurate as Experiment Station records, but I . believe the figures are worthy of consideration, and since they represent averages of rather a large number I believe they are very close to the average yields obtained. If the 1937 project did nothing else than to - make it possible for 150 Nebraska boys to receive the benefits of a year s Club training, and to give them the satisfaction of earning a 4-H Club certificate of achievement, it was well worth while. Much could be said about the production and feeding of sorghums, but these subjects will be discussed by others at this year's Organized Agriculture meetings. Suffice here to say that successful production depends on correct seed bed preparation, well adapted high producing varieties, timely planting, high quality seed, seed treatment, and proper attention to time and methods of cultivation and harvesting. The fact that sorghums have the well earned reputation of being more drouth and heat resistant than corn has acted as a handicap to their rightful place on Nebraska farms because too many look on them as a crop for poor land, and as an emergency crop for dry years. We must look at sorghums as a crop for good years as well as dry years, and as a good land crop as well as a poor land crop if we are to benefit from their full value. Because they are tough and can take it, they are too often planted on the poorest ground, and in poorly prepared seed beds. Give the high yielding grain sorghum varieties the same chance you give corn, and in the best corn years the sorghum yields will prob - ably equal and may out-yield corn. The basis for this statement is found in the Experiment Station results secured at both Lincoln and North Platte, and in the county variety test plots conducted by the Agricultural College. Let us go back to 1932 and 1933, the last good corn years for many parts of Nebraska, and see how our friends the sorghums compared with corn under favorable conditions. At Lincoln Experiment Station in 1932 figures show corn yielded 56 bushels per acre, but also show 5 varieties of sorghums outyielded corn from 1 to 9 bushels per acre. In fact the 5 highest yielding varieties averaged 61.6 bushels per acre. At the North Platte Station in 1933 corn made 30.7 bushels per acre while every grain sorghum except one out-yielded corn from three to 20 bushels per acre.. The five leading varieties aver - aged 47.7 bushels per acre, which was exactly 17 bushels or 55% more per acre than corn. Do you realize that in 1933 a 66% bushel yield of sorghum was harvested from the variety test plot in Phelps County, and that the top four varieties averaged 63 bushels per acre? Do you know that a 50 bushel yield was harvested in Hamilton County, and that the top three varieties in the Webster County plots averaged 43 bushels per acre? I do not know what your corn average in 1933 was, but I question if there were many fields in Phelps, Hamilton or Webster counties with averages of 45 bushels per acre. </seg>
         <seg id="p604">Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture All of the good yields just mentioned were produced, and reported by Agricultural College officials so their authenticity cannot be ques - tioned, but I now have a "believe it or not" sorghum story for you. Last winter when I read a newspaper account of Henry Maxfeldt of Stamford, Nebraska, threshing a crop of Sooner Milo which yielded 75 bushels per acre I naturally questioned it. Subsequent investigation later convinced me there was good evidence to substantiate the yield, but it was difficult to believe without seeing. This September when I heard Farmer Maxfeldt again had a field of Sooner Milo which gave promise of a 75 bushel per acre crop, I made up my mind to see it with my own eyes. I visited the field on September 23, while it was being cut, and also just before Thanksgiving when the threshing of the crop was in progress. Next to seeing a thing yourself pictures are the best medium of showing the actual condition, so I have prepared a poster showing several views of this outstanding crop of Sooner Milo together with a statement from Mr. Maxfeldt concerning the yield. You will note Mr. Maxfeldt states that 648 bushels and 42 pounds were threshed from an accurately measured area of 8.71 acres, and that 56 pounds was used as the weight of the grain. This makes a yield of 74.51 bushels per acre. This heavy yield, of course, was produced under favorable condi - tions, and is sighted only to show that sorghum will produce yields as high as some of the big corn crops some are inclined to talk about years after they are harvested. The 65 acre field where this big crop was grown is located in the Beaver Creek bottom in Harlan County. Corn was planted originally in both 1936 and 1937, but floods early in June each year washed the corn out. This year the first planting of sorghum was also washed out so the crop harvested was not all in the ground until about the 25th of June. In July another flood covered the field. In fact, it covered all of the plants, and left so much mud on the leaves that it appeared for several days that the crop would be lost. It re - covered, however, and the three submergings of the field with flood water during June and July thoroughly soaked the ground to furnish enough moisture to produce the big yield harvested. The comment is heard frequently, "Suppose we can raise more bushels of sorghum per acre than corn, there is no market for it, and it is not worth much for feed." This idea is very prevalent, and our Agricultural College officials have a big task before them to acquaint farmers with the feed value of sorghums, and feeding methods, which give the best results. I understand work along this line has already started as College this winter is conducting a number of feeding tests. To compare the value of ground sorghum grain with corn, at Gibbons, on the farm of Marshall Ross two lots of lambs are being fed for com - parison and experiments with fattening hogs are being carried on at the Lincoln and North Platte Stations, at the Curtis School of Agri - culture and at Franklin in the Havener Serum Company pens. After </seg>
         <seg id="p605">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association hearing Dr, McCampbell this afternoon, I believe most of you will agree that sorghum grain is a worthy feed just as I, after visiting with a few Nebraska farmers, who were feeding sorghums was convinced that the surest and quickest way to regain normal live stock production in •our drouth areas of the state is to rapidly increase the sorghum acreage in that territory. : Normally livestock furnishes about 72% of the cash income to Nebraska farmers. We all know What the drouth has done to cut live stock production of the state to a point where farm after farm does not have a hoof to send to market, and few if any milk cows to provide &lt;:ream checks for the necessary groceries. That ground sorghum grain is fully 90% as valuable as corn for feeding cattle, hogs, and sheep has been proven, by Kansas Experiment Stations, and that sorghum ensilage compares favorably with corn ensilage also proven by Kansas Stations, is further borne out by the experience of Nebraska farmers. A brief account of the experiences of E. E. Hester of Benkelman willshow how and why he has come to depend on sorghum as a means of estab - lishing his live stock production. In 1934 Mr. Hester first planted Cheyenne Sweet Stalk Kafir, and as most other farmers he put it on the poorest ground, and planted his good ground to corn. His 40 acres of sorghum produced enough roughage, which when ground and supple - mented with cottonseed cake brought a bunch of Hereford cows through the winter in excellent condition. He increased his acreage to 150 acres in 1935. The sorghum was again put on poor ground, but out-yielded his corn by 5 bushels to the acre. In 1936 his acreage was further in - creased to 350 acres, which yielded about 15 bushels per acre while his corn made 5 bushels 7 and when this crop was fed he was further con - vinced of its feeding value. On January 1, 1936, he put 60 head of Hereford cows in the feed lot, full fed them Cheyenne Sweet Stalk Kafir, which was ground heads and all, along with 2 pounds of cotton - seed cake per head daily. These cows were sold at Omaha March 15, showing a gain of 150 pounds or 2 pounds per head per day for the 75 days they were on feed. This year grasshoppers and drouth again caused his corn to be a failure, but Mr. Hester figures his 800 acres of Cheyenne Kafir would average one and one-half tons of roughage per acre, and if threshed for grain would average ten bushels per acre. While Mr. Hester has obtained excellent results from grinding the stock with the grain left on, and feeding it dry, many prefer to feed sorghum as ensilage. Take for example P. H. Williams of Enders, who this winter is feeding 500 steers on Cheyenne Sweet Stalk Kafir ensilage. His Cheyenne would have threshed about 15 bushels per acre, but it all went into a trench silo. He has fed sorghum ensilage for a number of years, and has had no more trouble with spoilage than he has had with corn ensilage, and is confident he receives more feed per acre from sorghum than he does from corn. Two of the 1937 division winners for the Nebraska Pasture Contest, </seg>
         <seg id="p606">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture name'y, J. B. Murphy of York, and Honor Oschner of Madison, as well as dozens of other Nebraska farmers, find sorghum ensilage preferable to corn ensilage as it is easy to handle, and they can produce more feed per acre. That the grain makes an excellent hog feed is well illustrated by the living example of a Polland China sow called "Milo" on the farm of the formerly mentioned Henry Maxfeldt. Last winter Mr. Maxfeldt was at an auction sale, and happened to raise his hand just at the wrong time as the auctioneer interpreted it as a bid, and to Maxfeldt's surprise he was the new owner of a little runty pig for the total sum of 35c. The pig was taken home in the car seat along side Farmer Maxfeldt, and as there was no corn on the place the pig was fed Sooner Milo from the big crop threshed in 1936. The runt did so well she was soon nicknamed "Milo". She has continued to thrive on the straight Milo diet, and is now a thrifty 300 pound sow with a fine litter of pigs, and to the owner's knowledge the sow has never had a mouthful of corn. Our agronomists in recent years have made great strides in proving the heat and drouth resistant sorghums while little if any improve - ments have been made in developing strains of corn which are most resistant to heat and drouth. More is being learned about production methods, and needed improvements are being made in machinery to produce and harvest sorghum crops. When we review the progress which has been made with both the producing and the fee-ding of sorghums in the past ten years, and consider the performance of sorghums under favorable as well as unfavorable conditions, we must recognize that sorghums to a certain extent cannot only do the job of corn, but in many parts of Nebraska can do the job that corn has failed to do. That job is to stabilize live stock production on Nebraska farms. Since these dry years have taught us that sorghums can be depended upon to produce more of roughage and grain than can be expected of corn, why is it not logical for the live stock farmer to plant enough sorghum every year to insure feed for his stock in case his corn is a failure. If both the sorghum and corn made good crops he would have corn to sell, and a surplus of sorghum roughage to store in a trench silo for some further emergency. A "Plant Sorghum" Campaign with a goal of diverting one-third the usual corn land on every farm in at least two-thirds of the state to an adapted sorghum is greatly needed in Nebraska. When such a program is put into effect it will help stabilize the live stock industry, and thereby will be of much benefit to the farmers of Nebraska. </seg>
         <seg id="p607">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association A LIVE STOCK FARM IN SOUTHERN NEBRASKA D. V. SPOHN As I see it the main points for successful live stock production in southern Nebraska are: 1. Good Breeding. As \ve drive over the country we see too many brindle bulls, too many rams that look like billy goats, and if we see any boars they are probably colored like Joseph's coat. ..."-.'¦¦ 2. Annual Pasture. ¦'. Rye, barley and Sudan pasture take the load off our permanent pasture, giving it a chance to recuperate and allowing us to carry more livestock. « ¦¦-.. 3 f Grow Some Sorghums. We were brought up with the idea that if we didn't have corn and alfalfa we couldn't keep live stock. We have had to change this and now are looking more and more toward the sorghums for live stock feed. They are truly an insurance crop for grain and forage. 4. Store A Surplus of Roughage for An Emergency. We grow an abundance of rough feed; the years 1935 and 1937 are examples, but we don't always have it when we need it. Therefore, I believe our main problem is one of maintaining a reserve. The trench silo as developed by our Professor Gramlich is ideal for this. OUTLINE OF TALK GIVEN DECEMBER 8, 1937 7 LLOYD W. STALDER, Humboldt Why Feed Silage? 7 I If we could have any feed we desired, and could disregard the cost, we would not feed silage. We will illustrate this by telling of Mr. Jones' experiences feeding cattle in Paradise. 11. We are not living in Paradise, but we are here in Nebraska, where dry weather and hot winds prevail. Our conditions are far different from an ideal Paradise; in fact they are similar to Hell itself. 111. Personal experiences with silage. 1.

LIVE STOCK POSSIBILITIES WALTER TOLMAN Each speaker has given part of what I intended to say until my talk necessarily must be more or less in the form of a summary. The speakers have been emphasizing various classes of live stock which would use roughage to advantage. This, of course, is based on the * fact that we are more certain of producing a roughage crop than a grain crop in Nebraska. We are situated between the range country which cannot produce grain and the corn belt to the east of us in which they consider their land too valuable to produce any great quantity of roughage. While our roughage crop is relatively sure and ordinarily our cheapest feed, we have an uncertain grain crop ranging from very little to a large crop available to feeders at a low price. If we are to utilize our roughage as a substitute for grain it is essential that the roughage be of high quality. That, I feel, is the basis for the emphasis which the speakers before me have placed upon silage. Silage is highly attractive to cattle and sheep and will produce greater gains or higher production than such dry feeds as fodder, wild hay, winter range and straw. Not only must roughage be of high quality to maintain animals on a plane of nutrition which will be profitable but it must be properly supplemented. For years we have been preaching the value of alfalfa as a supplement to our other home grown feeds, both corn and car - bonaceous roughage. Alfalfa probably has no equal for this purpose. However, during the last few years almost without our noticing it our acreages of alfalfa have killed out and our production has been greatly reduced. Consequently the limited amount of available alfalfa has not been sufficient to balance rations satisfactorily. Many upland live stock men are facing three alternatives: to buy alfalfa hay, to buy high protein concentrate, or the least satisfactory of the three, maintain their live stock on rations low in protein and mineral which will produce expensive and unsatisfactory results. In considering the advisibility of buying either alfalfa or a high protein concentrate, we can bear in mind that the experiments here at the University have shown 1 pound of high protein concentrate such as cottonseed meal, soybean meal or linseed meal, will take the place of </seg>
         <seg id="p609">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association about 3 pounds of alfalfa as a protein supplement. In feeding these high protein concentrates rather than alfalfa, we are not furnishing the necessary mineral which is supplied by alfalfa. In many localities the feeds are very low in mineral and some such simple mineral mixture as 2 parts steamed bone meal, 2 parts ground limestone and 1 part salt by weight will produce remarkable results when fed in a ration which does not contain alfalfa. In any case, if the mineral is made available to live stock, we are playing safe and not allowing a mineral deficiency to develop and limit the profits from our live stock feeding. One c'ass of live stack which has not bean mentioned is the general purpose red cow. Most Nebraska farmers are maintaining this type of cow herd. That many Nebraska farmers cannot be wrong. This must be under most conditions an efficient and profitable live stock enterprise. Mr. Thalman has emphasized the necessity of marketing high quality cattle, finished sufficiently that they will not compete with grass fat cattle if the marketing season is to be in the fall. Very few of these general purpose cattle will produce a calf of sufficient quality to sell to advantage during the fall season. The greatest return from these calves, it seems to me, is to be secured by one of two al - ternatives, either to feed the suckling or hand-fed calf well, getting him to consume grain from the time he is two weeks old, selling him as a heavy veal calf, or to market him at the next time when it is possible to get such a calf fat. By this I mean a calf of this type cannot be finished for market as young as a strictly beef bred animal. They will necessarily have to be carried through the first summer and the first winter on reasonably good rations and grass through the second sum - mer. As soon as silage is available in the fall I would recommend that they be placed on a ration of silage supplemented with protein. They will make very economical gains on this silage ration from 60 to 90 days. Corn may then be added to the ration bringing the calf up to a reasonably good finish during the spring months, the season of the year when cattle of medium quality ordinarily sell to the greatest ad - vantage. As Mr. Spohn has indicated, most general farmers like to get the intensive part of their live stock work out of the way during the winter to have more time available for field work. This suggests that the man with general purpose cows will probably want to milk during the -winter or early spring. The necessity of feeding high quality roughage such as silage and feeding a proper supplement to cattle milking during the winter Cannot be overemphasized. Not only are we interested in the classes of stock such as sheep, general purpose cattle and beef cattle fed oh grass which will utilize high quality: roughage to advantage but here in Nebraska we have frequently an additional problem of utilizing an immense crop of corn available at low prices. No other class of stock can be expanded quickly </seg>
         <seg id="p610">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture to utilize the corn so satisfactorily as hogs. To avoid the necessity of purchasing foundation stock for a hog herd we must be certain of sufficient grain feed to maintain a few brood sows. The grain sorghums are outstanding and the possibilities they offer of a certain grain crop. Even though a farmer may decide he does not want to turn over a major portion of his normal corn acreage to grain sorghum production, certainly from 10 to 30 per cent of that acreage might well be planted to this crop so that feed for poultry and milk cows and a few brood sows will always be available.

         <seg id="p611">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association CONSIDER MULE PRODUCTION ..; ROSS H. MILLER Although the mule has no pride of ancestry nor hope for posterity, he has long been considered one of the most useful beasts of burden and units of power in the United States, as well as other countries. Because of the niule's hardiness and also because of his rather passive disposition, he has been used extensively throughout the south on cotton and sugar plantations where negro help is relied upon to supply a large proportion of the farm labor. The southern states have never been able, to raise sufficient mules to supply their needs. Eight southern states, namely, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida actually had four times more mules than horses on January 1, 1935. Texas and Oklahoma also had more mules than horses on the same date. Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Tennessee and Delaware have practically as many mules as horses. It can be readily seen that at least 16 states in the United States must look toward other districts for their mule supply. Since: the 11 western states have never raised many mules, the south and southeast have always looked toward the middlewest or corn belt states for their mules. It is doubtful if Nebraska farmers have ever really enjoyed their fair share of income from the sale of mules. Of the '666,000 horses and mules on Nebraska farms on January 1, 1937, only 67,000 were mules and many of these were carrying plenty of age. Let us look for a moment at the price situation of horses and mules during the past 5 years. In 1932 the average value for horses was $43 and $51 for mules. This increased to $86 for horses in 1936 and to §105 for mules. Right now mule prices are off about $25. What is the reason? The southern farmer finds himself in a rather peculiar position. He has one of the largest cotton crops that has ever been produced and yet the total valuation of that crop is lower than it was for the last two years' crop when he produced almost three million less bales. Consequently the southern farmer just can't pay top prices for mules this year. Nevertheless, he must have work stock and he knows he will have to buy that many more mules when he is able to do so. How may the Nebraska farmer profit in this, shall we call it, export trade? We still have the right kind of brood mares to raise the kind of mules that are in greatest demand. The southern farmer de - sires a mule weighing about 1200 pounds that is sound,-,of good con - formation, standing, on good bone and plenty of foot, and above all- he wants that mule to be alert. However, a 1050-pound mule is liked almost </seg>
         <seg id="p612">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture equally as well by many farmers and always finds a ready buyer. Since this 1050-pound mule is in demand and brings almost as much money as the 1200-pound mule, it would seem that Nebraska farmers could well afford to raise more good mules of this kind for the southern market. The difference in the value of the 1050-pound and 1200-pound mule is less than the difference in the cost of production of the two. What kind of a mare is best suited for producing a mule that will find a ready buyer? The good mule mare should weigh around 1300 to 1500 pounds and be of medium type. She should possess lots of quality, correct feet and legs, and have plenty of life and yet have a docile disposition. Nebraska farmers have plenty of brood mares that would raise good mv es. If these mares are mated with a Jack weighing around 1000 to 1100 pounds, that is sound and of the right conformation, the Nebraska farmer will not be gambling on whether or not he will find a buyer for the resulting produce. That of course depends on whether or not the mule colt is given sufficient feed and care to insure proper development. 1 realize that there are not a sufficient number of Jacks available in Nebraska to insure a large mule colt crop for 1939. However, the encouraging fact regarding this Jack shortage is that at the present time these Jacks may be purchased at a figure that will allow a farmer who has 50 mares avai able in his community, to breed to a Jack the spring of 1938, to make a fair rate of interest on his investment and also be well paid for his time. If we are going to raise a few mules in areas in Nebraska where there is sufficient pasture and cheap roughage to make this sideline of farming a profitable enterprise, let's do it as well as possible so that we can get every possible dollar out of it. Besides, raising a good mule of the right conformation, we should also pay some attention to color. The good sorrel mules sell $25 higher than mules of any other color. The dark colored mules with light points are next in demand. Odd - colored mules are not in as great demand as good solid colors. Nebraska farmers who have lots of grass and roughages, can sell this feed through the production of mules very profitably and thereby receive some cash income annually from one of the most useful farm animals—the work mare that also is a brood mare. THINKING AHEAD R. E. KENDALL I feel that I am somewhat out of character appearing at this end of a meeting of this kind. Ever since I was bribed to leave the College of Agriculture back in 1926, 1 have been coming back to as many of </seg>
         <seg id="p613">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association these meetings and the various Feeders Day programs sponsored by Professor Gramlich and his associates as I could arrange to attend. My purpose in so religiously attending these meetings has been to listen to the results of the latest experimental work done here and to the experiences of practical live stock men from all over the state. There is no question but that the time spent here has been very much worth while to everyone who attends. It has been my good fortune the past several years to observe the methods and results of some of our good live stock producers and feeders in the various parts of the country. The sponsors of this meet - ing thought that I might have picked up something in my travels that would be of interest to this audience. I doubt if I have found anything that you do not already know. . Our state is divided by nature into several distinct districts, where soil and climatic conditions, crops and feeding systems vary widely. It doesn't seem to make much difference to our good live stock man where he lives; in the west end of the Platte valley where a good crop is assured even in drouth years if the river,doesn't go dry entirely; in the eastern third of the state where we have the highest average rain fall, and we used to think the surest crop prospects; in the pump and ditch irrigated central Platte valley where good crops of corn and alfalfa are had even when the rest of us dry out; or in the South Platte country where a decent crop is getting to be a remote memory. In spite of the rough treatment that mother nature has handed us, and a continued dwindling of that part of the: consumer's dollar that gets back to the producer's pocket, we find men in all of these sections who have consistently made the business pay. In searching around to see if these men had some secrets that gave them an advantage, I find that scarcely any two of them, even in the same locality, handle their business the same. One man may handle calves entirely, the next one yearlings; some feed the best qualitied cattle money will buy, some the cheaper grades; one man grinds his feed and keeps his cattle.in the dry lot for a year; his neighbor pastures his steers, followed by a short feed. : v . ¦ The only thing I have been able to find that these men have in common is they have a pretty good idea when they start out what they want to do, and they go ahead and make the best of the feeds their farms and their communities produce, or what they can buy worth the money. I find the feeding game is one that can't be played by watching the other fellow's hand. It must be adapted to your own set-up and run according to your own capabilities. There is nothing that can be substituted for experience. - '¦ : t I believe our Nebraska live stock men, on the whole, are the most efficient meat producers in the country. In a way, handling live stock </seg>
         <seg id="p614">Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture has been forced on them by our geographic location and the fact that we produce an abundance of rough feeds which can only be marketed in the form of meat. Long, hard experience and careful coaching by our practical ex - perimental stations have pretty well drilled the fundamentals of the production end of the business into our heads. While we can't afford to relax for one minute in our efforts to produce better live stock at a lower cost, the resourcefulness and adaptability of the Nebraska feeder has been well demonstrated by the way he has met his production problems the last few short crop years. Ordinarily we are in the center of one of the cheapest grain and feed sections in the country but this has been completely reversed for the time being by conditions over which we have no control. The story has been told over and over of the trench silo, the grain sorghums, and other drouth resistant crops, molasses, and the use of small grains in meat production as we never had to do before. To me this is just another demonstration that Nebraska still has the kind of men it takes to keep us at the top. We are going to raise good crops again and will get back to the old standard of corn and hay with what - ever supplemental feed fits in best for us, but we are not going to forget how to use the silos, nor that good pastures reduce production costs, and the other lessons that we have learned. Mr. R. H. Cabell, president of Armour and Company, in his address to the recent Nebraska state bankers at their convention here in Lincoln stressed two points that need a lot of emphasis. He contended that the only way to permanently rehabilitate the live stock industry was to reduce the cost of production, and cited figures to show the wide variations in the production costs of pork and beef in the same neigh - borhood. I wish he had been able to tell us how to do that. I am sure we are all awake to that problem and are doing everything about it we can. We can no longer move on to new rich land "and costs such as interest, taxes, and increased losses due to disease have been creeping up on us. We can't even control the cost of the feed and grain we produce on our own farms, so as far as I am concerned that along with the rest of the farm relief question is an unsolved problem. Mr. Cabell's other point was "Our live stock producer will have to become more of a merchant," meaning that we had to offer products the consumer wanted at prices the public would pay. There is no argu - ment on this point either. For years we have been improving the quality of our livestock and trying to anticipate the so-called market demands only to get to town with the results of the year's work and be told by the buyer that we had them too large or too small, that they trade wanted lower-priced stuff or that the eastern outlet was dead - locked by a meat boycott brought about by excessive retail prices. </seg>
         <seg id="p615">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association ; We are likely to blame the packer unduly for some of these condi - tions when he is no more at fault than the producer. The packer probably has made more advancement in processing and. distribution than we have in production. He operates on a very small profit per dollar volume and depends on a large turnover for returns to his stock - holders. The packing business is highly competitive. It is reasonable therefore to assume he isn't going to entertain any philanthropic no. tions even though the feeder is taking a bad licking, and a profit in his own business concerns him much more than a profit to the feeder. These two ends of the business are entirely separate, but each is in - dispensable to the other. Both are vitally interested in stimulating the consumer's interest in meat products and holding it at a point where he will pay a price that includes a legitimate profit for both the pro - ducer and the packer. Aside from the small contribution of 26(1 a car deducted by the commission companies at the terminal markets and turned over by them to the National Live Stock and Meat Board who have used it in a very: judicious and beneficial way, the producer doesn't contribute a thing to the advertising and educational promotion of his product. It is true the packer spends considerable money boosting his own brands and the retailer sometimes tries to enlarge his own trade, but this falls short of what a unified, intelligent campaign sponsored by the pro - ducer, processor and retailer might do. Formerly it was not necessary to urge people to buy and eat good meat or to inform them that it was not all priced out of line because a small elite kosher trade was willing to pay nineteen dollars per cwt. for a few specialty cattle during a year that crop failures had made it impossible to produce many of that kind.. ¦' ...-¦' Nowadays specialized products backed by intensive advertising have captured a good part of the consumer's dollar. Wide spread radio and newspaper advertising has greatly increased the sale of products ranging all the way from automobiles to silk stockings and alcoholic beverages until the average family budget can't be stretched to include all of them and leave enough to put our good meat on their tables. We think our products are indispensable and don't have to be publicized and-have sat back and let manufacturers of substitutes that can't com - pare with ours take away your domestic market. ' 7 My thought for the day, while as old as most of Uncle Ezra's, is as true as most of his: Without lessening our attention to production problems, we must give more time, effort and money to the promotion of our products^ We have organizations Which only need to be welded together and the meat board has shown us the way. "Now it is up to the producer to act.. '! 7 </seg>
         <seg id="p616">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture USING WHAT WE HAVE MARVEL L. BAKER At first thought this may seem to be a simple subject. The more we examine it, however, the more difficult its adequate treatment ap - pears. In discussing it, we shall have to resort to generalizations at times because of the limited time available. In doing so, we of course all understand that most generalizations are subject to some qualifica - tion. After all. what do we have in Nebraska? And how shall we use it? We have been told time and again that the wealth of Nebraska comes from its soil. In saying this we refer not to paper dollars and paper profits but to wheat and corn and oats and barley and rye and the sorghums and sugar beets and alfalfa and wild hay and grass. We refer to the cattle, sheep, hogs, horses, and poultry that are pro - duced, developed, and maintained on the products of the field and range. The time which I have could easily be taken up with a discussion of these crops and these kinds of live stock and how the one could be used to produce the other. I could tell you a lot of things we already know, and possibly a few things which would appear as new to a few of you. I wish to start a little farther back than with crops and live stock. I wish to start with the farm and perhaps with people. If we believe that the farm is the basis of wealth in Nebraska we should not have to be told that the preservation of its productive power is essential and we should not allow ourselves to be kidded into the belief that we cannot afford to practice good farming methods or a sound program of conservation of our farm resources. It is true that American agriculture is in a period of readjustment. It is also true that readjustments are seldom pleasant; they are often decidedly painful. There isn't any need to talk about the causes, the whys and wherefores of the readjustments that are now taking place. That they are paining us is generally conceded. Our problem is to use what we have in harmony with inevitable trends and not in fighting them. We are passing from the exploitative stage of agriculture into an older type of agricultural economy—a type of agriculture in which we must expect the farm to produce enough to meet fixed charges, operating costs, and to provide a reasonably satisfactory standard of living for the farm operator and his family. All of these, and in addition the productive capacity of the farm must be maintained. The approach to the achievement of a sound, permanent continuing agriculture must be based on the development and the general ac- </seg>
         <seg id="p617">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association ceptance of an agricultural philosophy not widely held in this country up to the present. We must learn to recognize'the farm as a desirable home and to make it such for this and succeeding generations—a place where people will be glad, and happy, and proud to live; a place to be maintained, and built up and improved. This task is impossible unless a goodly percentage of farms can be made to pay operating costs, and fixed charges, and to supply a reasonable standard of living. To use what we have to bring about this sound, continuing agri - culture we have to develop a farm program. I do not mean an agri - cultural program. My mind doesn't seem to be big enough to compre - hend an agricultural program taking in all of the nation's agriculture. That may seem quite a confession so I wish to balance it with the statement that I don't think my comprehension so different from that of a lot of other people—l merely admit some of my limitations. The thing I am talking about is a farm program—a program designed for a specific farm; a program adapted to that particular farm; to the resources, the preferences, and the capacities of Ith'e operator of that farm. Such a program must of course fit into the economy of the state and nation and even of the world. ! Easy! Of course not. Not only is this not easy; we may rest as - sured that.it will not come so near realization in our life, that we can stop thinking about it and working for it. One Of the first and essential steps toward a successful approach to the realization of this program is for us to divest ourselves of a few notions which seem to have become imbedded in at least our sub - conscious thinking. One of these is the idea that consumers exist for the benefit of producers, producers in this case meaning farmers. From this fallacy apparently stems the reasoning that if a man wishes to produce wheat, or cotton, or anything else except perhaps hogs and 18-cent cattle, that he has a God-given right to do so and that society, meaning in the case, the consumer, has an obligation to take that product at a price satisfactory to the producer. If we think about it at all, we know that we cannot for long enforce such a line of reasoning, especially in a country where the: consumers of agricultural products far out - number the producers and more especially since group pressure on government has.become as fashionable and as potent as it now is in this country. The sooner we get rid of this notion and set up our indi - vidual farm program to use what we have so that the consumer will be glad to buy our products at a price satisfactory to us, the sooner we shall approach a sound!and stable agriculture.' Another idea of which we can profitably divest ourselves in planning the use of what we have is.the idea that because a thing has been so that it necessarily should or will continue to be so. For example, the southeastern states are going to grow less cotton </seg>
         <seg id="p618">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and more of other crops and live stock—products that will compete with our products regardless of what is said to the contrary. If you do not believe this talk to the men from these states. At first they will try to soft-pedal this matter of competition but press them and they will admit the truth of what I have said. This development in the southeastern states is sound and inevitable. The people in this region are just as much interested and should be just as much interested in sound agriculture for their region as we are for Nebraska. The question of whether this development should be subsi - dized with taxpayers' money is another matter but whether it is or not, the development will take place. That it will affect the use of what we have is certain. Another similar development which is likewise sound and inevitable and likewise of interest to us is the use of more grass in the states to our east. These developments and the demands of a sound conservation pro - gram for our own state alike point to the increased use of grass and forage and hence to live stock in Nebraska. One of the pioneer leaders of animal husbandry research and thought in this country once made the statement. "The essential function of the animal in a permanent system of agriculture i- the conversion of as largo a proportion as possible of these im.lib.'c products into forms whose matter and energy can be Utilized by the human body." A program looking toward a permanent agriculture should keep this fact in mind. A dependable live stock program rests upon the reasonable assur - ance of a cheap, adequat. and certain feed supply. In Nebraska this can be built around grass and hay reinforced in many sections by that ever normal silo which Professor Gramlich preaches so eloquently. His scheme has the virtue also that no act of congress is necessary to call it into being and no complicated administrative setup is necessary to make it function. A reasonable basis of land tenure is an essential to any live stock economy. This does not have to be farm ownership by the farm operator, desirable as that may be. All desirable things are not possible and a good many things that seem desirable are less desirable in practice than we thought. Capital is also an essential for any live stock enterprise and the amount and time for which capital is available will determine the amount and the kind of live stock which can be handled. The mere providing of the things I have mentioned will not make a live stock program successful. Back of the program on each farm must be someone with an understanding of and a liking for live stock. He must have the ability to see the little things which make the difference between success and failure in handling live stock and then he must be willing to do the things he sees to do. A lot of times the difference </seg>
         <seg id="p619">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and . Feeders Association between the successful and the unsuccessful live stock man is merely that one has an infinite capacity for taking pains. What kind of live stock shall we select to make use of tohat we have? That depends on a lot of things—on the type of farm we have, on our likes and our dislikes, op the amount of capital we have, on whether we expect to go to Florida for the winter and leave the live stock to some one else, and perhaps to other things as well. For most of us the im - portant thing to do is to select the type of live stock we like and that we think will best use the products we are going to have, and then to take care of the live stock. We really have a wide variety of live stock and methods of handling them from which to select. For most of the farms on which a permanent .type of agriculture must rest there are probably two classes of live stock which should be seriously considered. These are a few milk cows and some poultry. Then cattle of some kind, or hogs, or horses or sheep of some kind may be included. It has been suggested that I mention particularly sheep with reference to the production of spring lambs. On many general farms such a farm flock would fit into the scheme of things admirably when considered from a long time point of view. Nebraska could well afford to pay more at - tention to the right kind of sheep. However,¦;no one should adopt any type of live stock enterprise expecting that all of "his troubles will automatically disappear and that his problems will all he solved. There is no royal road to wealth for most of us in the live stock business, or in any other business. I am talking about a long time program of ag - riculture; a program which will provide for the payment of fixed, costs, operating costs, a reasonable operator's income, and provide for' the maintenance of the productive resources of the farm. If our farm pro - gram will not do this, if we cannot' build up an agricultural philosophy which will result in such a program, then I believe there is no such thing as a permanent agriculture or a permanent, worth while civiliza - tion in Nebraska. -.: - Now as to the use of the products which we have. All of us have heard the use of the various grains and forages discussed from time to time. We know that all of them may be used with greater or less suc - cess for a wide range of purposes. We know that they should be com - bined so that they provide a mixture adapted.to the animal to which they are to be fed; that they should contain a proper supply of energy producing feeds, proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and that they should be relished by the animal to which they are to be fed. We know that no live stock breeder, either purebred or commercial, can afford to produce; poor quality stocky although sometimes and under certain con - ditions some men may find'^ the feeding of such stock profitable.^ We know that in any permanent, continuing system., pf agriculture pro - viding a satisfactory standard of living' judged by y 'western standards that live stock is the cornerstone.

We have for a heritage a I tradition of courage, resourcefulness, determination, and common sense which has served us well through the pioneer stages of our development. We have just passed through difficult years. It may well be that difficult years lie ahead. Those of us who still believe in Almighty God and that His hand directs the affairs of men and of nations should ask not for wealth and riches and a life of ease but should pray earnestly that we shall so live that when we come to the end of the road we can hand to succeeding generations not merely a material heritage unimpaired by the few years in which it was entrusted to our hands but a philosophy of living which will enable them to meet the problems of the future as well as that of the pioneer enabled him to meet the difficulties of yesterday. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUR OPPORTUNITIES S. R. McKELVIE To me the taking advantage of opportunities implies the keeping of the hand flexible, to be able to play out of either hand and in these days of trial and tribulation—to be prepared to run in either direction. Illustrations of what can and cannot be done in the way of taking advantage of opportunities can be cited from experiences at "By the Way" the past year. A year ago in the fall I was riding through the herd and noticed an abundance of grass. Not having enough steers to utilize this pasture I bought 120 head of large steers to match what I had. I turned them on grass the first of October and later added one pound of soy bean pellets, changed pasture during the winter, added a little hay in the early spring and fed two pounds of supplement from June on through till they went over the scales. Early this fall I luckily met a cattle buyer who showed his interest by dealing for 100 head of these big steers at a price that netted me $35-$4O per head profit. If there is any moral to be gained from the incident it would be, "Always feed an animal so he is fit for market." True, these cattle were right at a right time. I carried 22 head on for show. These cattle were my own breed - ing and besides wanting to take home a few prizes I suppose I was in - clined to gamble. These steers received four pounds of 22% cubes from September on and were good enough to merit an offer of $11 per hundred at the ranch just a few weeks before show. But I wanted to give them a try at the Ak-Sar-Ben. These animals showed second and brought $12 per hundred weight. Not figuring my loss in weight and worry at the show I estimated these steers lost me ?5 per head from he offered price at the ranch. I still had 50 head remaining and shipped these to Omaha ,n November. After being in the yards 3 days they </seg>
         <seg id="p621">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association went to the butchers at $7, netting me a loss of about $1,200 by keeping them. As you see I kept the herd a bit too rigid and overlooked the opportunity to go in the right direction. Opportunities are more gener - ally made than just happen. I've always maintained that it pays to grow calves out well by the use of a protein supplement. Their coat is improved, they learn to eat out of bunks and make much better use of their roughage. My father always held that you can't lose much money feeding a calf. . We in the cattle country have an appreciation for grass that I feel is not equalled by many in this country. The eastern part of the state has a real problem in its barren, weedy, eroded pastures and I think that all connected with live stock production realize that "the grass that grows upon a thousand hills" has been the mainstay for the live stock man. My plea to you is to practice judicious grazing, pre - serve and improve the grazing lands. This is an essential factor of a stable production program. A few words with regard to the. purebred business would not be out of place. Success in this field has not been founded primarily upon a sole interest in the price of the animal but rather a profound regard for the characteristics in an individual that is creditable to the in - dustry. Bob Hazlett commanded a position among the Hereford breed - ers that has been and will be envied for years to come. He loved his animals and saw in them a past and a future.. For that reason he rarely ever sold an animal. Animals require judicious care and the breeder must think not of today nor 10 years ahead but rather of the inevitable future.': In closing I ask you to take advantage of your opportunities by remaining your own master. We court cooperation and group activity.' It is almost indispensable, but please retain those characteristics that have made farming and ranching the most self-sufficing, romantic pro - fession of them all. We have a 10,000 bushel granary filled and enough hay under cover at "By the Way" to run us three years because we're determined to run our own business. We want to take advantage of circumstances. Again! I say, opportunities are made. We must run our own business or no one else will. REPORT ON LIVE STOCK OUTLOOK FOR ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE L. F. GAREY '¦ HOGS: There are about the same number of hogs on farms in the United States as a year ago. There are 30 per cent less in Nebraska. ' Hogs will be marketed at little heavier weights, because of greater </seg>
         <seg id="p622">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture supply of corn, thus causing the marketings to be a little later than usual. CATTLE: There is a decrease of about one million head of cattle on the farms of the United States from a year ago and about a half million decrease in Nebraska. About 20 per cent more cattle are on feed than last year. SHEEP: The sheep situation with respect to number on farms for both the United States and Nebraska is practically unchanged from that of a year ago. There is a greater movement of feeder lambs, larger numbers going to areas of increased feed supplies. The key to the changing demand for meat lies in the employment in the durable goods industries. Not since 1929 has the employment in the durable goods industries reached its normal proportion. Because Nebraska is located far from consumption centers, live stock provides the concentration device necessary to make agriculture an economic industry. If the two million acres of cultivated land is returned to grass and hay as contemplated, there will be an increase in the number of cattle in this state. BEEK CUTTING DEMONSTRATION KREI) BEARD, lowa State College, Ames W. W. DERRICK, Lincoln, Nebraska The advent of the locker has made cutting of beef more compli - cated than formerly because it is necessary to minimize space. What I will attempt to show you today are the methods commonly used and advised in the locker plants throughout lowa. The front quarter is worked up into steaks, roasts, boils and ground meats such as meat loaf and hamburger. The procedure is as follows: Remove plate 7 ribs long—remove bones and roll. Remove brisket—remove bones and roll for boil. Remove 7 rib (standing rib) —bones may be removed and cut rolled or it may be cut into 2 and 3 rib roasts. These rib roasts may be made into smaller packages by taking off the chine ends, removing 1 inch section out of ribs at end of eye, thereby making it easier to fold into a more compact package. The chuck remains and may be worked up in the following man - ner: Take off 2 ril.s from rib end. This is rather large and may be di- </seg>
         <seg id="p623">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association vided by either cutting from top to bottom-midway between chine and plate ends or by cutting through the seam. ••"-.•¦ The remaining chuck may be cut up into steaks from either the blade or arm side or a 2 inch roast may be taken from the arm side. This has a high proportion of edible meat. The neck should be boned out into ground or stew meat. . The hind quarter constitutes the more valuable portion of the carcass and is utilized largely in the form of steaks and roasts. It is worked up as follows: Remove flank by cutting from fore round to middle of 13th rib. Take out steak muscle. Remove kidney knob. Remove round from loin by cutting parallel and close to aitch bone. • The loin is worked up as follows: Remove rump. Bone out and roll! Remove short loin. Cut short loin and long loin up into sirloin, porterhouse, T-bone and club steaks. '¦ ..' The round is worked up in the following manner: Cut into round at stifle joint and remove front portion from round. Take out leg bone. Split the remaining portion into the top and bottom round. We have the following general recommendations to make with regard to storing beef in freezer lockers. Beef should be allowed to age 7-10 days before storing and all cuts should be made with a sharp knife and long sweeping cuts before wrapping. Extreme care should be taken in wrapping the meat because we have found that the greater proportion of the meat that has not kept satisfactorily has been accounted for in-either faulty wrapping or poor paper and rough handling into the locker. First of all use a heavy, waterproof, vegetable parchment paper that contains no fat solvent or oil that will be absorbed by the meat, thereby imparting an undesir - able flavor. Wrap so that no air spaces are present and no cracks re - main. Make a!special attempt to see that no bones are protruding that will tear the paper in handling. Handle the various packages care - fully to the locker, not subjecting them to any treatment that would tend to tear or loosen the wrapping. It is a well established fact that .sharp freezers are indispensable in proper chilling of meat prior to storage in the locker. Meat is placed in single layers in the sharp freezer, left here 12-18 hours depending on the temperature and then stored in the lockers. Meat properly chilled, cut, wrapped, and handled should keep for a period of six months and longer without any notice - able deterioration. ' . If there are no questions this concludes in a general way what we </seg>
         <seg id="p624">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture have to offer about meat cutting for freezer lockers and we only hope the future will offer more in the way of constructive knowledge in the satisfactory handling and storage of meat for the farmet. NEW METHODS IN MEAT COOKERY GLADYS LOONEY, Lincoln, Nebraska When we speak of new methods in cooking meats —we really refer to a collection and selection of the experiences, methods, research and attempts made to get the best results in this very important part of our diet and very favored food—experiments that have continued since the time of the story of the first roasted pig. That story supposed - ly handed down from Confucious and written by Charles Lamb, telling of the experiences of Bo Bo who in helping clear away after the burn - ing of his father's house—burned his finger on the pig that had been caught in the conflagration. The finger, of course, went immediately to his mouth and—ah—the first taste of the deliciousness of roasted pig. Burning homes proved a little expensive in satisfying the taste of the clownish Bo Bo and other means of producing and enjoying the delights of cooked meats—means of producing the best results—has been the outstanding job of cooks. While through your organization every effort has been made through the care and feeding of live stock to produce the best possible food product—and you have provided meats of good flavor, fine grain and tenderness —it still has to go through the hands of some cook before it reaches the family table. What is done to it in the process of cooking is most important—very important if the efforts of your organization are to be really enjoyed. Some time ago a magazine organized a club—so-called— whose theme was airing their grievances on "good food that was ruined by poor cooking." Questionnaires were sent out to men and women oi prominence and their grievances poured in. The largest percentage of them referred to meats —particularly those sometimes referred to as the good natured cuts—those that turn out fairly good with the worst of treatment. Bacon and pork chops topped the list. The crimes that have been committed in the name of cooking those and other cuts of meat are legion. Methods of cooking have gone through the stages of development along with equipment—have, in fact, had to be adapted to them—and as our equipment has become more and more modern and efficient our cooking methods have been simplified and made more sure. In the earlier and primitive day cookery—days of open fires —heated rocks — improvised ovens—when no attempts were made to make foods taste like something else—when the work of obtaining and that previous to preparation as well as that during the process were seasoning enough for any food—methods were simple. Those of you who like to indulge </seg>
         <seg id="p625">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association in bits of outdoor cookery fully appreciate this type of simple cookery that includes roasting, broiling and barbecueing. In the picturesque kitchens of a century or so ago—where the cooking was done on revolving spits before the blazing fires on gaping hearths, the problem of perfect roasting and broiling and stewing seemed to have been solved. This contact with direct heat produced food fit for kings—and retained the best of the flavor of the meats. Success, of course, depended a great deal on the judgment, experience and care given by the cook. Fires and food needed attention. As years passed on the fireplace with its spit and tripods was supplanted by the cook stove and even more possibilities were offered for variety in cooking—but—it was not as easy to reduce the heat in the cook stove oven as to move the roast farther back from the beds of hot coa's—not to set the iron pot in a place where foods merely sim - mered. Through that period we find the introduction of covered roast - ing pans for ovens and their indiscriminate use of water with all roasts and other cuts—to aid in further reduction of temperature and protect the meats from the intense heat. An attempt to prevent dried, over - cooked, burned products. The results were baked meats—not roasts - drained of all juices, steamed—tender, yet, but much of the best in flavor and food value lost. The water boiled away taking with it the fats and delicious juices of the meats—the cook hovered around—bast - ing—adding more water—to boil away and carry with it more of the meat juices and fats—robbing the meats of their flavor. When house cleaning days came and she scoured and scrubbed the greasy film that had collected arbund the cooler spots in the room—the woodwork j around the doors and windows—with never a thought that her work l could! have been prevented if all that delicious gravy had not been 7 wasted throughout the past months—for that is just where the steam from those past roasts had settled. The! advent of still more modern appliances—fuels that could be controlled—fuels from which a very quick intense heat could be had— a constant heat—fuels that could and did keep pace with our rapid American style of living—and again we find changes in our cooking methods. Sauteing—cooking in a small amount of fat—commonly termed • frying—was at its height—a method that cruelly mistreated defenseless steaks and chops—we find roasting—for at least a part of the time - done at the hottest temperatures of the oven—cuts that should have been cooked gently—braised, stewed or cooked at simmering tempera - tures—were briskly boiled in quantities of water. Both buying and cooking were hurried. Gradually we realized that just so much time and heat absorption was needed for this cooking process; and hurried it could not and would not be—and have good results. We only lost flavor, food value, the true deliciousness of meats and had in turn ' crisp, dry, and toughened foods.' </seg>
         <seg id="p626">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture We find in our newest methods for meat cookery a return to some of the oldest principles. Some of the very old cook books read very much like the new ones. We find a return to lowered temperatures, longer, slower cooking, and for roasting and broiling a return to the applica - tion of direct heat. Roasts are oven cooked and uncovered, no water is added and the cooking is done at a low even temperature. The results are improved tenderness and flavor, less shrinkage, retention of juices, every slice servable and cooked to the degree of doneness desired' Guesswork and unnecessary watching, basting, turning, adding of water completely eliminated. Most modern ranges using such fuels as kerosene, gasoline, elec - tricity and gas make provision for broiling and are equipped with a broiling compartment. Many appliances to use with all fuels are on the market and broiling has become a very favored method of cooking. It has much to recommend it and not only in the delightful food produced but from a health standpoint a. well. "Aunt Het" very well expressed it when she said some time ago. "If Jim didn't quit courting that widow she was going to take him nut to the cemetery and show him what fried foods had done to the other two." Modern marketing of meats has had its influence, too, on the cooking of meats—the possibility of rushing into a market and purchase a select and choice cut—those that were likely to give satisfaction or at least a greater degree of satisfaction regardless of its hurried, care - less cooking and treatment—has made certain cuts in demand—while the less tender and consequently less desirable and less expensive cuts have been neglected. In the days of home killed meats every part of the animal was utilized. A great deal has been done to perfect methods of cooking these cuts and a great deal of effort has been made to promote the use of and get the most satisfactory results from the use of these extremely nutritious and really delicious cuts. These less tender cuts must be cooked at low temperatures and need a moist heat to break down connective tissues. If oven cooked they should be covered, they may be braised, stewed or simmered but never cooked in boiling water nor with a great deal of heat. Liquids are sometimes added—depending on the cuts used and possibly as a variety in flavor. These cuts offer much in variety, economy and at the same time are high in their vitamin content, nutritious value and certainly are most palatable. New cookery methods in addition to setting the proper temperatures and time for cooking of meats—have brought out many other points of value and necessary to producing the best results. Cuts of meat should be roasted in pans comparative to their size. Small cuts are difficult to roast successfully. Every encouragement has been given to induce buying in quantity and cuts of sufficient thickness to insure good re - sults. There are so many ways of using the roasted meat that it is really an economy and time saver in the long run. Small roasts—l mean </seg>
         <seg id="p627">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association the two pound variety that many families of two insist on buying, can hardly be called a roast—and if cooked by the usual methods are. apt to be dry even if nothing worse happens. Such cuts can be cooked by the broiling method—direct heat. The. time of cooking is minimized— less shrinkage and loss of juices. This not only applies to rib and rump cuts but to some of those termed more suitable for pot roasting. Other points that have, needed emphasis and stress along with methods have been the necessary presence of fat for the best results and the fact that we should buy meat by the pound and not by the yard. There is much greater return! for your money in a small, reason - ably thick piece of meat than in a paper thin slice that spreads over a greater area. Steaks and chops to broil must be 1-ather thick to get best results. Letting meats come to room temperatures before cooking has helped prevent serving many a steak and chop that more nearly resembled leather than something edible and incidentally is much easier on the cook's disposition. : ¦ The newer methods are amazingly simple—just a few rules to follow. First of all, know your cuts of meat and the methods or type of cooking that will produce best results for that particular cut. Loin cuts rather thick should be selected for broiling. Ground beef, patties of pork, lamb and sausage broil beautifully/ Ham and bacon are at their best cooked in this manner. For roasting we select the more choice cuts, avoid high temperatures—3oo to. 350 degrees are quite enough. Cook with the fat side up that it may baste through the meat as it melts during the cooking process. A standing rib forms its own rack—others should be placed on a rack or trivet in an uncovered pan, no water added and cooked at a low even temperature. A meat thermo - meter will register the exact degree of doneness. Timed per pound and a little judgment as to its heat absorption will do in case a thermo - meter is not used. . . \. For the less tender cuts—arm roasts, chuck, end of the round, etc.—a moist heat is desirable. This may be covered in pan or roaster in the oven or a rather heavy, tightly covered pan of the dutch oven variety on the surface. Again the low even temperature. Such cuts may be seared or browned for flavor. The tight cover and its own moisture is sufficient for many cuts. Liquid is needed with some. Still other cuts such as the shank or neck may be stewed or cooked in water, simmered not boiled. Roasts, pot roasts or braised meats, stews are usually salted when put on to cook though it may be added later. Broiled meats are salted as served. . As for frying—in most cases don't. Braise instead. Brown the veal or pork chops, cover tightly and let cook slowly. Bacon? The calamities it couldtell if it had a chance.

         <seg id="p628">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Attention given to the few details will bring ample rewards. Cook - ing is an art that demands doing some seemingly unimportant little things at the proper time; requires courage, some skill, real determi - nation at times, and even a little profanity on occasion, but if seasoned with a sheer love of doing it one has a combination that produces amazing results. THE ROMANCE OF MEAT H. R. DAVISON Throughout the whole recorded history of the human race, meat has played an important and dramatic role. If you think that meat is just meat, and therefore not a particularly interesting or dramatic commodity, you must go back into history. One dare not conjecture when cookery was first employed. One may only surmise that it was not long after the invention—or the discovery—of fire. Our earliest records, the crude carvings of cave dwellers in middle Europe and the monumental inscriptions of Egypt and Assyria, show cookery as an already highly developed art. Almost all primitive people had the legend in some form or other that the roast of sheep and goat was acceptable as an offering to their deities. Meat preparation among some of the ancient civilizations of Assyria was apparently considered of so much importance as to be semi-sacred; only the priestly order could engage in it. The Egyptians are recorded to have had food laws in which the priests were judges of meat. The poet Homer put sausage in Book Twenty of the "Odyssey," and Vergil's verse refers to cattle breeding and even branding. In ancient Rome, the word for money, "pecunia," came from "pecus," meaning cattle, and when Rome developed bootleggers long ago, they sold not intoxicants, but sausage—a product then opposed by the'early Church as too often the companion of pagan revelry. Charles Lamb, in his "Dissertation on Roast Pig," tells us how the world owes the discovery of roast pork to a naughty Chinese boy, 80-bo. 80-bo accidentally burned down his father's cottage, and with it a litter of young pigs was burned to death. Wondering what would happen when his father, Ho-ti, returned, he stooped to feel one of the pigs, burned his fingers, and to cool them applied them to his mouth. "Some of the scorched skin had come away with his fingers and, for the first time is his life (in the world's life, indeed) he tasted—crackling." Then the whimsical story goes on to say how "as often as the sow farrowed, so sure was the house of Ho-ti to be in a blaze," how the practice spread all over China until some wise philosopher arose who </seg>
         <seg id="p629">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association discovered that it was not necessary to burn down the home to get roast pork. Comparable to Charles Lamb's story is that of Thomas Farrington Devoe, who in his book "The Market Assistant" repeats a story trans - mitted to him by Henry W. Dunshee on the discovery of the beefsteak. Lucius Plaucus, a Roman of rank, was ordered by the Emperor Trajan for some offense to act as one of the menial sacrifices to Jupiter. He was dragged to the alter where the fragments of a victim lay on the fire, and was forcibly compelled to turn them. In the course of his assignment he made the discovery that the taste of beef carbon - ized by burning was infinitely superior to all of the old soldiers' cook - ing in Rome. He at once evinced his obedience to the emperor by seeming to go through the sacrifices with due regularity, as well as his scorn of the employment, by turning the whole ceremony into a matter of appetite. He swallowed every slice, deluded Trajan, defrauded Jupiter, and invented the beefsteak. The sirloin is popularly associated with a mythical conferring of knighthpoi upon it as a supreme mark of favor by Charles 11, while he was in a merry mood at one of his court banquets. It was a search of spices which were needed in quantity in an age not blessed with food refrigeration that sent Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Magellan,! and hundreds of others to far horizons. Historians tell us that the Norsemen were the first to bring cattle N to this country nearly a thousand years ago. In the spring of 1007, Thorfinn Karlsefni, aroused by reports about "Vinland" and urged by his beautiful, adventuresome bride, Gudrid, started out from Greenland with three or four ships, carrying one hundred and sixty men, several women, and quite a cargo of cattle. Our chronicle tells us that three years elapsed before the disappointed company were forced to turn their backs'upon that land of promise and return to the fiords of Greenland. It was the hostility of the natives that compelled Thorfinn to abandon his enterprise. At first they traded with him, bartering valuable furs for little strips of scarlet cloth which they sought most eagerly, but they were terribly frightened by the cattle, and the chance bellowing of a bull sent the natives squalling to the woods from which they did not return for three weeks. Then quarrels arose; the natives attacked in great numbers; many Northmen were killed. Finally in 1010, the survivors returned to Greenland with a cargo of timber and peltries. | ¦ Five hundred years later, when Columbus reached the new world, he immediately noticed the lack of any domestic live stock in the West Indies, and so on his second voyage, he brought back cattle, hogs, sheep, and poultry to the island of Hayti. Cattle, hogs, and sheep followed Cortez to Mexico within a few years after the conquest. </seg>
         <seg id="p630">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture However, probably the first live stock to enter the present limits of the United States were the 13 hogs which the Spanish explorer, De Soto, had with him when he landed in Florida in 1539—about fifty years after Columbus' arrival. In spite of the forest, rivers, and swamps to be crossed in a thousand miles of wandering, and in spite of the Indian battles on the way, the herd grew. At the time of De Soto's death on the Mississippi river three years later, his herd of 13 hogs had increased to 700. Since De Soto had hoped to found a colony, tho hogs had been reserved for emergency rations only, and even when on one occasion there were neither acorns, maize, roots, nor wild grapes to be had and the men were fatigued as well as famished, they were al - lowed only half a pound of pork per man per day, and then only until an Indian village with a full corn-crib had been reached. Sometimes they had to go for weeks with no meat whatsoever. But after De Soto's death, the tattered Spanish survivors soon devoured their pork and sailed away to Mexico. Then "for two-thirds of a century more, our southern forests were undisturbed by the civilized grunt of pork on the hoof." Similar privations were suffered by the English after their landing at Jamestown in liiOT. With no live stock whatever, and very limited supplies of grain, they reached the point where a small can of soaked barley was a day's ration for five men. Even four years later, the sup - ply of food at Jamestown was still so meager that to slaughter meat animals or poultry without the High Marshal's permission was punish - able by death. Almost as valuable were the first few live stock at Plymouth Colony a generation later. In Plymouth, for a time, it took six people to own a cow. The first meat packers in the United States were colonial farmers who, within the lifetime of the Pilgrim Fathers, began packing away in salt not only pork and beef, but also venison and even bear meat. After 1641, while England was busy with her Cromwellian troubles, these farmers were able to take over the British trade in meats with the West Indies. The first New England farmer now known by name to have entered the meat packing business commercially was Captain John Pyncbon of Springfield, Massachusetts, who was also a storekeeper, fur trader and wampum maker, grain dealer, and the builder of the first sawmills and perhaps the first gristmills in that region. With the return to England of his father, William Pynchon, founder of the city, and in whose footsteps he had followed as a trader and as a local judge, Captain Pynchon was said to be the country's leading citizen during most of the latter half of that century. Twenty years before William Perm was to become famous by doing likewise, John Pynchon had obtained land from the Indians by making a treaty with them in </seg>
         <seg id="p631">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association 1653; he paid for it with wampum and merchandise, and in turn was repaid by the settlers who occupied the land. By 1655 Pynchon was sending cattle to Boston. Between 1662 and 1683 he bought and barreled large numbers of hogs, as well as buy - ing much of the pork that his neighbors also had barreled for sale. Pork was apparently sent to Boston by wagon from the Connecticut River valley as early as 1667, the wagon taking pork and potash and bringing back barrels of rum, Grain and pork, incidentally, were sometimes used as money in early Massachusetts, at prices fixed by the colonial government. To be destitute of salt pork was even con - sidered "disreputable." George Washington also lived on a farm and loved farm life. The father of our country, in fact, was a country boy who had never seen a town of 5,000 persons until after he was grown. He repeatedly bought more land with his earnings as a surveyor, and he sought the paace of farm life as often and as quickly as other affairs would permit. Even when President of the United States, he found time to take notes on farming in the states he visited. One year he raised more than forty tons of tobacco, and he left for his heirs more than 300 cattle and 600 sheep, as well as a wandering, uncounted stock of hogs. He experimented with fertilizers and with cattle feeds, and eventually gave his fattening pigs a roof, a floor, and running water. He knew the meaning of a corn crop failure and the sinking feeling that greets a tax bill when there is ho cash in sight. It is said that he sometimes served as many as four kinds of meat in a prompt two o'clock dinner. I wonder if you know that the original "Uncle Sam" was a meat packer. The story is told of how two young brothers, Sam and Ebenezer Wilson, set-out to seek their fortune. They arrived by foot in Troy, New York, and the younger youth, Sam, then 21 years of age, engaged in several different lipes of work, finally becoming a meat packer. He was a friendly, cheerful type of man who endeared himself rapidly to those with whom he was associated. In due time he became known to everyone in Troy as Uncle Sam. One day during the year 1812 a river boat pulled up to the dock at the foot of Ferry Street. Standing on the wharf were a number of casks of meat en route to the American army, for at that time the United States was at war with England, and Troy wfls an important shipping point for army supplies. One of the passengers from the boat noted that on each barrel of these army supplies were the letters, "U. S." The passenger asked an Irish watchman, who was standing near by, what the letters "U. S." meant. "Must mean Uncle Sam," answered the watchman. "Uncle Sam who?" ...:.. </seg>
         <seg id="p632">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture "Uncle Sam Wilson, of course—he's feeding the army." Uncle Sam feeding the army—that sounded like a good joke. The story quickly spread. Soon Uncle Sam came to mean the United States Government. And thus, there came into being the famous character— the symbol of America, Uncle Sam—named for the humble meat packer of Troy. Today the name "packing" does not describe the industry's function accurately, for a relatively small amount of the meat processed actually is packed. The barreled salt pork so well known a few decades ago is now packed only for a few lumber camps and a limited export demand. As towns and cities grew up along our eastern coast, packing houses increased in number. When such communities arose which did not produce their own meat animals and began to grow in size to the point where the farm lands nearby could not produce enough live stock to meet the local demands, outlying districts were utilized for live stock production and animals were driven in from distant points. In 1794 came new spurs. ".Mad Anthony" Wayne routed the Indians at Fallen Timbers, thus opening the Ohio country to safer farming and live stock raising, and the collapse of the Whiskey Re - bellion in Pennsylvania tempted corn farmers to market their crops in hogs instead of hogsheads! When the prairies beyond the Alleghenies were being opened to farming, before and after the War of 1812, live stock were produced in large numbers, but the meat could be gotten to the large centers of population in the East only by driving the animals over the mountains or by shipping animals or cured meats by boat down the Mississippi River and up the Atlantic coast, since there was then no way of transporting fresh meat over long distances. In 1805 George and Felix Renick of the Scioto Valley of Southern Ohio drove the first lot of fat steers across the towering Alleghenies to faraway Baltimore, by much the same route along which Baltimore and Ohio railway travelers now dine on steaks, chops, or sandwiches. In Maryland these cattle sold for $25 each, plus a dollar for each inch of their waist-line circumference over a certain average—a valuation basis which contrasts strikingly with the modern buyer's careful ap - praisal of each animal's potentialities. Hogs also were driven over the mountains—sometimes 5,000 at a time. Cincinnati after 1830 became known as "Porkopolis," having "per - fected the system which packs fifteen bushels of corn into a pig and packs that pig into a barrel and sends him over the mountains and over the ocean to feed mankind." </seg>
         <seg id="p633">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association But all this time meat packing -was a seasonal industry which could not be conducted in warm weather. Even when relatively large packing establishments first appeared in Buffalo, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, and Chicago, meat packing was still a seasonal industry. Up until about 1850 the packer was usually a warehouse man who hurriedly packed the farmer's hogs on commission and tried to ship them for him before the rivers froze over, or before warm weather returned. The development of artificial refrigeration, however, removed the warm-weather obstacle and meat packing became a year-round process. The problem of transporting fresh meat from the packing centers to the thickly populated eastern cities still remained, but this was solved by the development of refrigerated railway cars by the packing in - dustry around 1880. . It was not long before these efficient refrigerator cars by the thousands were carrying fresh meat from the packinghouses of the Middle West to the cities of the East. The news spread rapidly through - out the West, where herds of beef cattle were grazing on the wide prairies. More and more great ranches were established, until it was claimed that two-thirds of our beef cattle was raised west of the Mississippi River, although two-thirds of the meat was consumed in the East—a condition which is true today. After the buffalo disappeared from the western plains, tremendous herds of cattle took their place—cattle which were rounded up by one of the most picturesque figures of American history, the cowboy, who passed his days in the saddle and his nights on the open prairie under the stars. The cattle ranch and the cowboy will ever remain in memory as one of the finest and most typical American institutions. But hot all the story of the meat industry is in its past. There is equal interest in the present, if we but turn our eyes and see the tremendous drama constantly being enacted even today—a drama that ceaselessly moves on from farm and prairie and plateau, in winter snow or summer dust, by trains and trucks that chug no less dependably while the world at large is sleeping. On any day of the year, and at any hour or minute of the day or night, this vast procession is in con - stant motion. Hot waves and cold waves may come, or drouths, bliz - zards, floods, and tornados; but the meat parade goes on. Today, almost two-thirds of the farm land of this country is de - voted partly or wholly to the task of producing the meat in its national menu, and one of the country's largest manufacturing enterprises is that of dressing and distributing this meat. Almost half of the country's billion acres of farm land is used in supplying pasturage for live stock* and more than a third of the remainder grows hay, grains, or other crops fed extensively to live stock. According to the latest Census of Agriculture, that of 1935, there were nearly seven million farms in this </seg>
         <seg id="p634">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture country, of which four out of five raised cattle, three out of five grew hogs, and one in every eleven raised sheep. Thus, the live stock popu - lation of the country is greater than its human population, there being approximately half as many cattle, two-fifths as many sheep, and a third as many hogs in the United States as there are human beings. On an average the people in the United States eat about 34,000 cattle every day; they eat 25,000 calves; they eat 63,000 sheep; and they eat 192,000 hogs. The average American eats about 50 pounds of beef per year, . or 7 pounds of veal, about the same quantity of lamb, and from "&gt;() to 70 pounds of pork. On a basis of a 12-hour day, the people of this country eat 10,000 hogs per hour. Every hour of the year, on the average, the country's farmers have to harvest eight or ten square miles of coin field in order to grow the pork that the coun - try consumes per hour. As nearly as I can estimate, the people of the United States had served up to them for lunch today approximately 130,000 head of live stock. But the meat-producing process does not work automatically. It is subject to drouths and other weather factors, to the changing ability of factory workers and other consumers to pay for meat, to the laws and regulations imposed by state and federal governments, and to the varying opinions and preferences of the farmers themselves as to when to raise live stock or when not to, when to sell them, or when not to. Suppose the farmers raise a bountiful crop of meat, as was the case in 1933, at a time when the ability of consumers to pay for meat is very low; in that case the supply of meat outruns the demand for it; prices drop very low, and the consumers of course get a bargain, but the farmers who grew the meat may get nothing whatever for their work. Or suppose a disastrous drouth conies along, as happened in 1934 and again in 1936 and in Nebraska in 1937. The drouth cuts the corn and hay crops; with feed so high, the farmers have to reduce the num - ber of live stock they are raising; and in a year or so, when con - sumers have forgotten all about the drouth, along comes an alarming shortage of live stock and meat, and nobody away from the farm or the packinghouse, or the meat store, seems to understand why meat prices have increased correspondingly. Incidentally, figures of the United States Department of Agricul - ture indicate that the percentages of the consumer's food dollar finally reaching the farmer in the ease of meat and of the dairy and poultry products sometimes distributed by the meat packing industry are among the highest received by him from any of the food products he raises. In the case of cattle and sheep, by-product values sometimes make it possible for the meat packer to pass on to the farmer for the animal as much as he himself will receive for the meat it produces. </seg>
         <seg id="p635">Nebraska Live Stock Breeders and Feeders Association Meat has no peer as a food for man. Perhaps yon have heard it said that it is possible to eat too much meat in the daily diet. Yet there have been countless families along the world's frontiers who have lived exclusively on meat. The family of Abraham Lincoln throughout a large part of his boyhood lived chiefly or sometimes exclusively on meat. When in 1816, the Lincolns started from their Kentucky home for the Indiana wilder - ness, two horses carried not only the family of four, but all their worldly goods, except for the few tools that the carpenter father had taken across the Ohio river earlier. Albert J. Beveridge, one of the most exhaustive of the Lincoln biographers, tells us that the Lincolns, during that first winter in the half-open cabin in the wilderness, had no other food but game brought in by Thomas Lincoln, Even during the second winter, although at some seasons, nuts and wild fruit and wild honey were added to their diet, the family lived almost exclusively on wild animals and birds. They were their "meat, water, and bread." Much more recently, the adventures in diet of Vilhjalmur Stefans - son, the internationally known Arctic explorer, have proved beyond a doubt that meat has no peer. For a whole year, Mr. Stefansson lived among the Eskimos on an all-fish diet. Again, a few years ago, he lived a whole year on an all-nieat diet. The Institute provided a fund so that Mr. Stefansson could conduct this experiment. Under the ob - servation of scientists at the Russell Sage Institute of Pathology in New York City, Mr. Stefansson, together with another Arctic ex - plorer, Mr. Andersen, submitted himself to this test. For an entire year these gentlemen lived almost exclusively on meat. They were observed daily at the Russell Sage Institute. When the experiment: began, one of these gentlemen was over weight and the other under weight. At the end of the experiment both of them were of normal weight. Mr. Andersen was somewhat bald-headed when the experiment began, but at the end of the year, a few hairs had begun to sprout. While we make no claim for this latter point, it is of interest. Mr. Stefansson contends meat is a food which can be eaten in quantities in either the temperate, the torrid, or the polar regions. He has lived a whole year on fish, a. whole year on meat, and he thinks it would be possible to live a whole year on vegetables'. "Wherever man resides or travels, there is a constant'need for meat—and as long as farmers, meat packers, and others co-operate un - failingly in meeting this demand, there will be no need for hungry diners to sit down to an uninviting table of the concentrated pills and tablets which some claim will be the dreary lot of mankind in the future." </seg>
         <seg id="p636">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture GETTING YOUR MONEYS WORTH WM. J. LOEFFEL During recent weeks we have witnessed rather sharp declines in both pork and beef prices. The opinions expressed by many for this fall in prices is without regard for the principal determiners of price, namely: supply and demand. Live pork and beef prices parallel retail meat prices very closely and so it is natural to assume that the prin- • cipal demand factor is the quantity and price that the housewife is willing to pay for meat over the counter. It was plainly evident that a shortage of prime heavy cattle made for phenomenally high prices in late summer. Conditions like this cause people to lose their sense of equilibrium, as is revealed by present beef prices. Many people condemn the retailer when in reality he is a necessary adjunct to our business. We must keep him. Meat prices are extremely sensitive of wages. The average house - wife has a limited amount of money to spend for meat and buys in accordance with the amount that she has. Over a period of years there is a distinct correlation with reference to wages received and retail prices of meat. The price of meat over the counter is determined to some degree by margin, buying, volume and rate of turnover. It is extremely disheartening to know the basis upon which much of the meat is purchased over the counter. In one retail store this fall I found: Loin ends with 66% edible meat selling for 16% cents Spare ribs with 39 . edible meat selling for 18% cents Neckbones with 35-40. edible meat selling for B'i cents I have just said that the retailer was indispensable in the market - ing of our meat products but at the same time I feel that some retailers have forgotten salesmanship and confined themselves largely to the t performing of a service for their customers. At the same time some have slipped greatly in the quality of their meat. As a possible remedy "! for the handling of a better grade of meat some have suggested that it is a good plan to require a grading law. I'm not so sure that this grading would be the thing because it would strangle individual initiative for fostering their brand of product. Lard is cheap in comparison with pork prices and still it doesn't move very readily. Lard substitutes have exerted a strangling effect upon the sale of lard partly because they are cheaper and secondly by reason of an intensive advertising campaign. It is up to the producers to get going and advertise or we'll come out on the short end of the horn. </seg>

It is generally conceded that shipments on rail come through with less bruises than those on truck. This varies with the class of, stock. The general causes of bruises are: overcrowding, mixed shipments, poor loading and improper bedding, weak partitions and equipment, dirty and diseased conditions, low vitality of animals, rough handling in cars and trucks, excessive feeding and watering before loading, exposure in cold weather, lack of ventilation in hot weather, fighting with strange animals, sharp corner on gates and posts, protruding nails and bolts on trucks and chutes. Prevention of these losses may be brought about by the use of proper equipment in handling, some of which are: canvas slapper, electric prod pole, strong properly built chute, truck floors cleated, use of hurdles/proper driving/education of all who handle live stock so that they will treat all animals with the due consideration that should be theirs.; :'-..:¦ * ']:_' ¦ ' 777'":-". ¦':! .-'-.

I am sure you will be doing Nebraska a service that will pay big dividends in the "Prevention of Disease". ,_••' ¦/ PROTEINS AND VITAMINS AT MINIMUM COST WM. J. LOEFFEL Practically everything has been said about proteins and vitamins at previous meetings here at the College, however, I feel that they are of sufficient importance to merit consideration once again, especially since proteins are one of the most important and costly constituents of feeding stuffs. Proteins are more often the limiting factor in an eco - nomical hog production in Nebraska than any other one thing. For the most part the Nebraska farmer has an abundance of feeds rich in carbohydrates but must depend upon the by-products of other in - dustries for his protein needs. . ',".-'¦ .¦';'. The principal and standard source of protein has been tankage, a by-product of the packing industry. The value of a protein supple - ment depends upon the need for it and the quantity and manner in which it is fed. As a general rule, however, 1 pound of 60% protein tankage will save an average of 6# of corn in dry lot and approximately 4# of corn in legume pasture. ; Meat and bone meal generally runs around 50% protein. It is ap - proximately equal to tankage and constitutes an excellent source of calcium and phosphorus. Milk, -whole and skim, is one of the very best feeds for growing animals. Two gallons of skim milk are about equal to. 1 pound of tankage. Buttermilk, semi-solid and dry milk are by - products from the creameries. The semi-solid buttermilk contains 15-18% protein while the dry powdered milk is about 35% protein. They are fed most conveniently in mixtures with other feeds. Green buttermilk has recently made its appearance upon the market and derives its name from dehydrated cereal grasses, ground and mixed into the semi-solid buttermilk. ! •"¦:'. . . The oil meal by-products carry about 35-45% protein and when fed with tankage tend to'stretch the latter. The use of cottonseed, linseed or soybean oil meal may be determined by the cost per ton. The expeller soybean meal is preferable to the solvent meal because it seems a trifle more palatable. All of the oil meals are fed more advantageously in mixtures. Mixtures seem more palatable, provide a more complete protein, increase the corn consumption and result in higher gains. </seg>
         <seg id="p642">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Alfalfa meal of a good green color has been used with very good results for breeding hogs and gives a very good account of itself in the trinity mixture. The dehydrated meal is slightly more valuable than, the ground alfalfa because of its vitamin content and apparent quality. We think that many of the breeding difficulties in live stock may be attributed to a shortage of vitamins A, D and E. Vitamin A is found most abundantly in the hays and grasses. Vitamin D in cod liver oil and sunshine, Vitamin E in sprouted cereal grains. A subject that has brought considerable inquiries to my desk the past year has been concerning yeast feeds. Experimental results were available on the standard yeasts at other stations but these later yeasts claimed the presence of minerals in the yeast. The Station conducted a test last summer on the use of yeasts in the oats ration. Six lots were fed as follows: Lot 1, Corn—tankage. Lot '_. Soaked ground oats. Lot •'!. Soaked ground oats and W pound tankage. Lot .. Soaked ground oats and dry killed yeast. Ix&gt;t "i, Soaked ground oats and yeast-o-lac I Lot 6. Soaked ground oats and nulac ( There was no advantage in yeast feeds. 13 bushels of oats plus yeast were required to produce 100 pounds of gain. The yeast-fed hogs shrunk more en route to market and the carcasses produced were not as well finished nor as desirable. WHAT LIVE STOCK MEANS TO THE AVERAGE NEBRASKA FARMER TOM LEADLEY Live stock has long been an important factor in Nebraska agricul - ture. It has contributed greatly to the family food supply, utilized labor, provided income, and utilized feed crops and grains produced on the ,' farms and ranches. In 1936 the income from grains netted $48,000,000 ' while that for live stock netted $205,000,000. The combined income 7 from crops and live stock varies from 69 to 83. of the total farm in - come. The past 10 years has witnessed a drastic decrease in both numbers } and income from livestock. This has been most pronounced in the hog business, where there has been a reduction from sto 1,567,000 million ...: hogs and a corresponding decrease of from 28.737. to 20.97. in per cent •' of total income. Since administration policies have affected reduction ¦ . in cotton acreage in the South, many people in the corn belt are wonder- :'-.. ing if the South has made any significant moves toward partially dis- ' </seg>

There has been a.30% increase in hog production in the South during the period 1930-37 while hog production in the United States is in 1937 84% of the 1930 figure. 1938 promises to yield an increase in the spring pig crop. Incidental with the production increase in the South is the large increase in Packer Capital throughout the southern states. It appears to me that they are there to stay and what concerns me is whether or not they will be moved to make even greater investments in this new producing region. A few remedies that I would suggest for this situation would be as follows: Pray for good weather and repletion of live stock numbers, storage of feed by the use of the trench silo and granaries, pasture redemption, feed and equipment loans, growing of sorghums, credit loosening. ; ¦; . : . </seg>

         <seg id="p648">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture GROWTH OF THE POTATO INDUSTRY and FUTURE PROSPECTS IN THE NORTH PLATTE VALLEY 0. W. Nibler, Scotts Bluff County Agricultural Agent The subject that I am to speak upon, is rather a broad one and pertains to the potato industry in the North Platte Valley. Today, the figures which I will quote, arc for Scotts Bluff County, as those ay. the ones 1 am most familiar with. This county produced approximately, 55 (53.6) percent of the 1937 Nebraska potato crop. Therefore, the industry in the county is repre - sentative of the industry in the North Platte Valley. Scotts Bluff County produced one-half million bushels of potatoes in 1910 on 3500 acres, and twenty-seven years later, or in 1937, produced approximately, .'!&gt;! million bushels on approximately 20,000 acres. This is a 600 percent increase in acreage and production, during the past quarter century. Accompanying this increase in acreage and production there has been a slight increase in average yield, with good and poor years inter - woven. The greatest increase in acreage occurred in 1931, when 18,000 acres were grown compared to 9,000 in 1930. Previous to this, the acre - age increase had been gradual. You growers realize, without me mentioning it, that some years the potato crop has bought new cars and then other years, they hardly repaired the old one. In other words, the cash income from potatoes has fluctuated. The potato crop in 1910, was worth about $275,000, the i crop of 1936 worth approximately $3,000,000, and in 1937, the crop will return to the growers about $975,000. \ During the past twenty-seven years, methods of production have .. been improved and varieties have been standardized so that the Bliss . Triumph is universally grown with a few Irish Cobblers entering into \ the potato acreage. : There have been rotations adopted that have been beneficial. During the last twenty years, sweet clover acreage has been greatly increased . and used extensively in many potato rotations. There were only 500 f acres of sweet clover grown in 1918, while this was increased to 17,000 ) acres in 1937. Three and four year rotations are now being used by i growers where sweet clover is the sole legume. A rotation of grain in l which is seeded sweet clover followed by potatoes and sugar beets is not </seg>
         <seg id="p649">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association uncommon. The sweet clover is plowed under as a green manure the second year, and much nitrogen and organic matter is added. I The use of sweet clover as a milk cow or sheep pasture the second year and then plowing under in the fall for potatoes the following year has proven very profitable with growers. Most successful potato growers in the county, however, have in - corporated alfalfa in their rotations. Commonly a 5- or 6-year rotation is used in which there is three years of alfalfa. This permits longer *¦•' periods between potato crops and yields a small percentage of culls. Growers have become interested in the use of better seed during the last decade. Only two growers produced certified seed in 1925, while last year, potatoes were certified for ninety-two growers. This growth in the production of certified seed, indicated that seed produced under irrigation is nearly equal to certified seed production on the dry land. The drouth years that have occurred recently, haye definitely caused ah increased irrigated certified seed acreage. As a result of the increased acreage and the availability of certified seed, table stock growers are improving their seed stock. Potato cost account records kept by producers show that over a four-year period, certified seed potatoes were produced at a cost of 25 to 30 cents per bushel, where the yield was 225 bushels per acre. Sto.'age and marketing costs in addition, -were 10 to 15cents per bushel, - thus raising the total cost from 35 cents to 40 cents per bushel. Cost accounts vary considerably, depending upon yields, but the figures 1 have given represent the average costs over a period of years. The past years have clearly demonstrated that potatoes are an important cash crop on irrigated land. They are second in importance as a cash crop in Scotts Bluff County. The potato acreage is definitely moving southeast in Scotts Bluff County. Growers have clearly shown that the production of potatoes is a scientific enterprise. The use of good seed, planted not before the 10th of June, and then properly irrigated and cultivated has produced good yields of high quality Bliss Triumph potatoes. ; Some growers have been able to practically eliminate mechanical injury at harvest time and thus put into the cellar 85 percent or more of their-. otatoe« as U. S. No. l's. One grower this morning has told hoW he produced a large percentage of V. S. No. l's* Demonstrations last fall, that were conducted on the elimination of mechanical injury, clearly illustrated that Potatoes could be harvested free from mechanical bruises and cuts. I am not a crystal-gazer, therefore, it is impossible for me to know any more about the future of the potato situation than you do. Using </seg>
         <seg id="p650">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture the past as a guide post for the future, and not a hitching post, there are a few suggestions that I might leave with you. First, it would not seem advisable to increase potato acreage in the next ten years as it has been in the past ten. If efficient and prod - uctive crop rotations are to be maintained, the potato acreage might be shifted within the county slightly but not increased. Second, intensified cropping practices generally provide opportunity for more insect and disease troubles. Planting certified seed and spray - ing will not correct all of these difficulties. The grower will need to study more than ever, factors which might cause trouble. Third, the yield of potatoes per acre has not greatly increased dur - ing the last twenty-seven years because new growers have been continu - ously starting into the potato raising business. If the number of growers become more or less constant, there will probably be an increase in yields. Fourth, the elimination of mechanical injury to potatoes at digging time, would yield for the county, a higher percentage of U. S. No. l's that are below the surface of the ground when digging starts. Fifth, there should be created more interest in the activities of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association because their program is for the best interest of the producers. 4-H Potato Club activities should be encouraged and increased, as eventually these 4-H Club boys will be the potato growers. In closing, I wish to remind you that this irrigated area is better adapted to potato production than many other areas. There are 1,400,000 people in the state of Nebraska eating 3,500,000 bushels of potatoes an - nually or half of the state production. '¦ Are you as a grower, doing everything possible to see that Nebraska people eat Nebraska potatoes? j PRODUCING QUALITY POTATOES IN NORTH PLATTE VALLEY . Carl Ehrman, Gering, Nebraska The subject of my talk is "How to Produce Number One Potatoes" '¦¦¦ and the person that assigned this subject suggested that I state how I obtain large yields and a high per cent of Number One potatoes. ; Before I could give it much thought I feared maybe there was V something I did not know about it and my sympathy went out to Pat. \ Pat was walking down the street deep in thought, soon he met the I* Priest. Said Pat, "Father, may I ask you a question?" Priest, "Yes, </seg>
         <seg id="p651">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association ¦¦¦¦'• ,-¦ -.'..¦•¦•'•-. .... ... -'¦'... ! Pat, anything you wish." Pat, "Father, I know all about Shrove Tueg - ! day, Ash Wednesday, Good Friday/but what the devil is nut sundae?" I shall take- Mr. Hankins' suggestion and tell how it is done on my ' farm. The very first step in producing Number One potatoes is the choos - ing of Number One potato land. Any potato grower would choose alfalfa or sweet clover ground, although some of my highest yields have been stubble ground heavily manured, and I have also had good results'-by plowing under a crop of spring grain planted on old ground. We plow our ground about the 15th of May or soon thereafter. Clover ground will be plowed when the clover is a little above the knees in height. It is then still in a tender stage and will rot quickly. The Creator of this earth knew that the best ground should be on top so he placed it there and I believe that is the place for it too, so the plowing is done about seven or eight inches deep and harrowed in the same operation. As soon as the plowing is done the soil is gone over with the disc, set almost straight to pack the soil deeply, eliminating air pockets and re-establishing, capillary attraction with the subsoil. Then it is left in this mellow state to catch and absorb all moisture that falls, making it an ideal seed bed. If no moisture falls before planting time, small ditches are made by taking off the covering discs on the potato planter and the planter is drawn through the field as if planting. Then water is run in these ditches. As soon as the soil is dry enough the covering discs are replaced and the seed is planted in these '.: ditches. . ¦-.'•; ¦' 7 To grow quality potatoes one must have quality seed and Ne - braska State Certified seed is quality seed. The seed should be treated for scab and skin diseases but I have damaged my seed at one time with hot formaldehyde treatment and obtained a poor stand, so I resorted to a cold treatment and have never had much scab even this year when scab has been serious in places. About the Ist of June the cutters commence to cut the seed in ' quite: large pieces, dumping them on the cellar, floor about four or five inches deep. They are left in this manner to heal over until planting time, which is the 15th of June or soon after. The cut seed is loaded on a truck and covered with a canvas to keep away the sun's rays and hot winds while they await the planter. The seed is planted so as to be about three inches under the sur - face after being harrowed down. No blind cultivation is done in alfalfa or clover ground as the soil is not yet packed enough and the roots and stems of the old alfalfa are not rotted sufficiently to do a good job, but harrowing is done in the direction of the rows just before the sprouts come far enough to be broken off. </seg>

Now I would like to make a comparison of potatoes of two farmers. Let us say each one has grown 6000 bushels. Farmer No. 1 has 4 percent and Farmer No. 2 has 75 per cent mechanical injury. These are real and actual figures and I hope Mr. Hankins will verify them in his talk.

When nature has given you Number One potatoes why not do your best to keep them so? A HARVESTING SYSTEM THAT GIVES RESULTS. W. T. Young, Jr., Kimball, Nebraska The importance of proper harvesting of potatoes should be stressed more than any other potato production operation, for the reason that </seg>
         <seg id="p654">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture all of the other practices may be nullified by improper methods used during harvest. The controllable factors governing the harvest are: The proper use of suitable equipment, and the careful handling of the potatoes from the time they are dug until they are delivered in the storage cellar. Any statement that 1 make here today are conclusions drawn from my own experience in harvesting potatoes. The time to begin harvest should be governed by your past experience and the statistics determin - ing the average dates when potatoes freeze in the ground. The effect of freezes may be somewhat eliminated by ridging your potatoes during the last cultivation with disc shovels. I have not found it satisfactory or practical to ridge them just before harvest. It is well to delay harvest until you have a killing frost on the vines, especially if there have been late rains, but always keeping in mind the fact that all of the potato crop should be out of the ground by October 10th to avoid the chance of serious freezing damage. Under irrigation it might be well to grow a strain of Triumphs that mature medium early, especially so with beet farming. The harvest should be so arranged that it can be completed in a period of two weeks time, necessary additional equipment to be ob - tained when larger yields or more acres would draw it out for a longer period. On late wet seasons without frost causing heavy vine growth it may be necessary to slow aown the tuber growth and loosen them, from the vines, by mowing. The ideal equipment for harvest is the rubber tired tractor pulling diggers with reasonably flat beds, with continuous webs power driven from the rear of the machine, delivering the potatoes with a minimum amount of fall to the ground: wide steel wheels with binder type cross lugs or rubber tires work the best. The best type of blade if the ground is hard or the potatoes deep is the saw-tooth type. A multiple speed transmission on the digger to regulate the speed of the web is important and should be diligently used as the type and condition of the soil change. The speed of your tractor often times should be increased when you are having too fast a separation on your web, thereby digging more acres, and carrying more dirt to cushion your potatoes. The picking belts and sacks are the. best equipment into which to pick potatoes, putting from 40 to 50 pounds of potatoes in a sack. The low geared flat bottomed bed trucks, well padded to transport potatoes to the cellar from out of the field work best. The trucks are loaded by lifting the partly filled sacks, left in the field by the pickers, setting them on the fiat truck bed for the loader who stacks them in rows of </seg>
         <seg id="p655">I Nebraska Potato Improvement Association tiers tied together by overlapping the unfilled portion of each bag. The truck is unloaded by the hauler who hands the bags to a cellar man who in turn hands them to the man who places them in the bin. It is important that there!be plenty of help at the cellar so that the man who puts them in the bin may start filling the bin from , he rear end by piling the potatoes about two and a half feet deep, then laying cross bars about that height above this layer, then place the walking plank on these cross bars and putting on the second layer of potatoes in the same manner and continuing this process until the bin has been filled to the desired height. Earthen covered storage has been proven to be the best and cheapest storage. These cellars should be well wet down to a depth of about three feet about a month before harvest. Narrow bins about eight feet wide with slatted partitions permitting circulation of air between the back of the bins and with open cribbed fronts have been proven very satisfactory. Unless you have air vents running upward from vents through the bins.about every four feet it is not advisable to have air ducts laterally through the bins as most seasons they seem to cause more dry rot and early sprouting than where none are used. Cellars should have plenty of ventilation above 60 degrees during the first three weeks in storage after which temperature should be lowered to about 36 degrees for winter storage. It is well that each operation of the harvest be checked often, at least until harvest is well under way and the organization working efficiently. If the potatoes are coming into the cellar with cuts, shatter bruises or cracks or are unduly skinned up a checking back to find just where the damage is occurring should be done immediately and the cause removed. There is no reasonable excuse for mechanical injury of potatoes in excess of three per cent ! •'.. By a strict compliance to rules suggested in my remarks here today &lt;n my own operation I have been able to reduce my loss by harvesting each year until this year it was less than three per cent. (Editor's note:—The crop handled by Mr. Young in 1937 amounted to 80,000 bu.) .'7 SOME SOIL FERTILITY PROBLEMS OF THE POTATO GROWERS OF THE NORTH PLATTE VALLEY E. S. Lyons, Associate Soil Technologist, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Scottsbluff, Nebraska The term "Soil Fertility" includes many factors. It refers to the ability of the soil to produce a crop. In a more restricted sense, and one more commonly used, it is the ability of a soil to supply the essential plant food elements to the crop. If the soil will yield an adequate </seg>
         <seg id="p656">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture amount of these elements to produce a good crop, it is said to be a fertile soil. The state of the fertility of a soil is very important. If plant food is the limiting factor in the production of a crop, the elements lacking or unavailable to the crop must be supplied. The state of fertility desired may depend on other factors of which, perhaps, the most im - portant is usually moisture. A soil may be in a high state of fertility for dry land, while it would be low under irrigation. The statement is often heard that a certain crop is "hard on the land." The reason for this statement is often the speaker's experience of a low yield of the subsequent crop. While crops have an affect on the physical condition in which they leave toe soil, perhaps of greater im - portance is the amount of plant food they remove from the soil and the amount left for subsequent crops. All cops require essentially the same elements of plant food for growth. These elements are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phos - phorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, sulphur, and during the last two decades we have had to add manganese, copper, zinc and boron. There are possibly others which may have to be included. The first three are secured from the air and water and are of little concern from a soil fertility standpoint. These three compose about 90 to 93 per cent ot the entire dry weight of a plant. Nitrogen, as is well known, may be secured from the air by legumes under the proper conditions, but for non-legumes its source is from the soil. The source of the remaining ten or more elements is from the soil. All elements secured from the soil must be in solution to be available for use by the plant. Very often a soil may be high in a given element in an unavailable form and unless it can be brought into solution by some practice, its addition in an available form is necessary. The amount of the different elements used is quite variable and the ratio between any two may be affected by the crop grown or the stage of growth. Different species of plants grown under identical conditions differ in their elemental composition. The composition of the plant may also be influenced by the abundance and distribution of an element in the soil. ft is therefore evident that a definite chemical composition cannot be given for a specific crop. If an element is available in abundance there may be a "luxury consumption" in its use. There should be avail - able to the crop sufficient amounts of each element to balance the whole to produce the most profitable returns. If an element is supplied in too large an excess there may be a direct loss. It would, therefore, seem that the soil chemist should, by analysis of the plant or soil, determine the elements lacking and supply them in the proper amounts. This is not as easy as it appears. There are </seg>
         <seg id="p657">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association many factors affecting the availability to the plant of. the different elements. Some of these factors are materially affected by weather conditions. A large number of such tests have been advanced. These tests are recommended quite highly by those who developed them, but when used by others many criticisms are reported. None of these tests are perfect or exact. If used by someone who realizes their limitations and understands that they are not infallible, but only indicative, they may prove helpful in recommending fertilizers where the user is familiar with the soils, climate and field response from the fertilizers. Many determinations have been made of the composition of crop plants grown under various conditions. Data from a variety of sources have been assembled to show the average pounds per acre of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash used by a good yield of each of the more important crops grown on the irrigated land of the valley. These data are given in Table 1, which also includes some data of the effect of alfalfa and sweet clover on the soil nitrogen.

They will, however, serve to show a comparison between crops, and between that part of the crop ordinarily marketed and that usually left on the farm. While an attempt has been made to give yields which are compar - able on a good soil adapted to the growing of any of these crops, they are not comparable for all soils and all conditions. The difference in the total pounds per acre of nitrogen and phos - phoric acid required for the potato, sugar beet or corn crop for the yields as given is not large. Barley requires less nitrogen and phos - phoric acid than do the first three crops given. Beans fall into the intermediate class for both nitrogen and phosphoric acid. Beans, being a legume, secure a part of their nitrogen from the air. Under most conditions of this section alfalfa secures the greater part of its nitrogen from the air. It will, however, use approximately the same amount of phosphoric acid as the potatoes or beets. This must all come from the soil, if the hay is sold from the farm the equivalent of 100 pounds of treble superphosphate is sold with every four tons. In the sale of any crop, livestock, or even milk from the farm several elements of plant food are being removed. Of course this can - not be avoided, as the business of farming could not be conducted without the sale of some products, yet the removal of a part of these plant food elements may be reduced by utilizing all feed crops and waste residues. In addition to the use of elements from feed by the animals, there is always some loss from the manure before it is hauled to the field. This loss is larger if the manure is left in the feed lot or in a pile. The following data show the disposition of the major con - stituents in the feed materials. </seg>

With the loss of plant food from the farm, when cropped as heavily as is done in the irrigated sections of Nebraska, some method of maintaining fertility needs to be considered. The one most desirable is the growing of legumes in the rotation providing it is used for green! manure, or fed on the farm. Even when fed on the farm neither alfalfa nor sweet clover increases the plant food elements of the soil, except the nitrogen. They may, however, increase their availability as the plant roots and resi - dues decay.': The judicious use of all manure and plant! residues produced helps to maintain the fertility leyel of the farm. Some farmers are doing an excellent job of keeping their soil in a high state of fertility as indicated by the yields of crops which are well above the average of the vicinity. Too often the field just across the fence under different management is producing crops only j average, or below in yield. These farms may be producing too large a -percentage of cash crops with insufficient methods of maintaining soil fertility. .-. ! There are many farms in this section where the amount of manure produced is not enough to keep the fertility sufficiently high to produce a profitable crop. While it is good farm practice to utilize all manure and plant residues produced on the farm, many have found the practice of buying both feed and livestock for the sole purpose of increasing the manure supply a rather hazardous practice. About fifteen years ago a product known as "artificial manure" was devised. Straw is stacked up layer by layer with a mixture of fertilizer salts.. Usually sulphate of ammonia and superphosphate are used and generally lime is added. The mass is kept moist and if condi - tions for decay are favorable the compost is ready for use in four to eight months. As a result of the addition of water one ton of straw will produce about 2.5 tons of manure. The product. closely resembles farm manure and field tests show it equal to farm manure in increasing yields. The cost of the fertilizer is about 75 cents per ton of wet manure. Moire recently it has been reported that under general farm con- </seg>
         <seg id="p660">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ditions there is no advantage in composting the straw and fertilizers. If the straw is scattered over the field, equally good results are secured by plowing it under in conjunction with the fertilizers. Decomposition then occurs in the soil avoiding the labor of adding the water to the heap and later hauling this water to the field. Where there is not enough manure produced on the farm often commercial fertilizers may be used more economically than manure can be purchased. In several instances in other sections they have shown just as good results as manure over a period of years, providing the proper elements and amounts are used. During the last three years fertilizer experiments have been con - ducted with potatoes on two farms and three fields. These experiments were on the sandy Tripp soil series, the first test being on a Class Four soil. The data is given in Table 3. Every fertilizer combination gave an increase in yield. The highest yields for any treatment are not what, should he expected on a good soil. Experiment 1 was on a very sandy soil. The second was grown undei a shortage of irrigation water and in the third, a part of the field was .loping and overwatering cut ditches between the rows and the ridge was not properly wetted. Yields for the same treatment in this field ranged from 80 to 292 bushels. Comparison of single 1/20 acre plats lying adjacent gave an increase of 100 per cent for the fer - tilizer. The entire acre under experiment yielded just twice that of the acre of the commercial field alongside. For the grower who does not have sufficient manure on the farm, the use of commercial fertilizer is worth considering. The choice between buying fertilizer and buying manure will depend on which can be purchased the cheaper. In this section where the use of commercial fertilizer is fairly recent, there are those who condemn its use under any condition and fiose who suggest the use of some fertilizer for all crops and soils where yields have not been satisfactory, regardless of other conditions which may be the cause of the low yields. Commercial fertilizers do have a place. Where they will produce the increases cheaper than other methods, they will find that place and be used. They should neither be recommended nor condemned indiscriminately. Being more concen - trated plant foods than manure and plant residues, more information as to the kind, amount, manner of application, and soil conditions is neces - sary before it is known just when and where commercial fertilizers should be used in this section. </seg>

POTATO PRODUCTION AND HARVESTING METHODS Used by "400 BUSHEL CLUB MEMBERS" IN 1937 By T. H. Hankins, Agriculture Extension Service, University of Nebraska The Agriculture Extension Service and The Nebraska Potato Im - provement Association co-operated in conducting a potato production contest in 1937. Potato growers faming under irrigation systems were notified by the County Agriculture Agents of the contest and each was given an opportunity to compete. Five acres was the minimum acreage accepted in the contest. An honorary organization was set up to which each grower producing 400 bushels of U. S. No. 1 potatoes per acre is eligible. Eighty-eight potato growers in Nebraska entered the contest. The contestants represented four counties as follows: </seg>

One of the purposes of the production contest was to learn what production methods were being used by the growers who produced a large tonnage of number one potatoes. The important practices are listed below and the number of growers using each method is given. The four growers in Buffalo county grew the Cobbler variety.

Three of the growers planted state certified seed potatoes. The average amount of seed used was eighteen bushels per acre. The number of times the fields were irrigated varied from two to five times. Many other practices were done differently by nearly every grower such as the method of irrigating. One grower who applied only two irrigations used one and one-half inch pipe to let the water into the individual rows. The stands were practically perfect. The ten western Nebraska growers all grew the Triumph variety and there was practically a perfect stand in each field. The important production methods are listed in the followimr chart.

EXPERIENCES IN MARKETING QUALITY POTATOES FROM THE NORTH PLATTE VALLEY. Ted Currier, Morrill, Nebraska. First I wish to advise you that in my opinion, I know a lot more about potatoes than I do addressing a crowd such as this. However, I was invited to address this meeting and here I am. The effect, results, or the value of the information I hope to give you, you many judge for yourself. No doubt there will be a number of you who won't agree with all of my ideas, but I will express my opinions, and whether right or wrong they arc offered in all sincerity. 1 came to western Nebraska when I was twelve years old and have spent the last 20 odd years in Scotts Bluff County, except for the few years I was attending school in eastern Nebraska. I recall the first impression of the potato industry in this manner. As a boy at home, which was in a small eastern Nebraska town, I recall we used to have a garden patch which included a few potatoes for our own use. My job, it seemed, was to keep the potato bugs picked off the vines, in ordev that we could secure any growth whatever, and when I arrived in Scotts Bluff County and saw all the large fields of potatoes I thought, "My Gosh, what a job, picking bugs off all these vines," and much to my surprise, I learned they had no potato bugs out here. All of which I couldn't understand, as back home it seemed that potato bugs were a part of the potato itself. I bi.ng out this little detail which happened 21 years ago this summer, to be exact, to show you the picture as it has changed during my experi - ence here in Scotts Bluff County. You all know we now have trouble with potato bugs here. Not so severe some seasons as others, but prevalent enough most every season the past few years to require spraying in at least some fields in this district. These potato bugs, along with other insects, such as psyllid yellows, or purple top, flea beetles, etc. only show us the older the district becomes as a potato producing section, the more pestilences and insects we have to contend with, the more problems we have to solve, and changes we have to make in our methods of farming to combat and compete against the natural potato enemies. Some of these changed methods and ideas </seg>
         <seg id="p667">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association '..-''-- - . ¦.. ¦ . are worthy of retaining. Many, we must of necessity, discard as im - practical. In other words, due to bugs; diseases and old ground, etc. we can not farm potatoes here today the way we did 20 years ago. Now this change has also occurred in the marketing of our po - tatoes. This change in marketing has been made necessary by the ir - resistible forces of competition. It has been necessary to readjust, rearrange, and reorganize our system of marketing. I recall 20 years ago that we used to load potatoes in the bulk. Of course we had to scoop these potatoes out of the bin into a wagon, thence from wagon into the door of the car, and then back into the car. This obsolete process of loading, of course, damaged and bruised a large portion ..of the good potatoes. From that bulk loading stage we finally ad - vanced to packing random weight in old, used bags, bags which would, run anywhere from 50 to 250 pounds, from that stage on to new even weight 120 pound bags, then to new 100 pound even weight bags, and finally the last year or two we have seen 50 pound even weight bags packed, and now we are even packing consumer's size 10 pound bags. All of these changes, of course, are being forced onto us by competition. By competition, I mean other potato growing states. In order for us to sell our potatoes in the same markets with our competitive states, it is necessary to pack our potatoes so they will be just as attractive, just as good in quality, and of just as much value as potatoes from our competitive states, if we are going to sell our share of the potatoes to the consumers. For descriptive purposes, it will be necessary to bring into the picture at this time, a few personalities. The John R. Jirdon Potato Division is one of Mr. Jirdon's varied enterprises here. in the valley. "While the potato di - vision of the John R. Jirdon Organization is only two years old, I myself, have been in the potato business in Morrill for the past 12 years, connected with the former Jordan Produce Company, which business was sold to Mr. Jirdon two years ago. Like one of the fix - tures, I went along with the business, part of the stock, so to speak. In discussing with Mr! Jirdon the policies we planned to pursue in the potato division, I stated that we should have a featured pack of quality potatoes, something to (offer the trade which we were not ashamed of, and would be willing to put.our name on the sacks and stand back of the reputation of this pack at all times. Out of this idea developed our Blue-J Brand. Our idea was to make the Blue-J Brand the last word in quality potatoes from this district. We want our customers to know and irrevocably depend on this brand for quality. We want them to know we Will stand back of this brand and our name every turn in the road. Naturally to establish any article it is first necessary to have this article or commodity forced to meet !•' a certain requirement. For example, last year, which was the first l) - season for our Blue-J brand, we required this pack to he at least i ¦ • '-..¦•':'•¦ '¦•'.' ¦- :7 ''¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p668">Report of Nebraska State Board op Agriculture 90% U. S. No. 1 quality, and even at that grade it was necessary to repack a few cars to maintain our specified requirement. This season we set strictly U. S. 1 requirements for our Blue-J and in turn we were again forced to re-pack a few cars during the season because they failed to meet U. S. 1 requirements. These were few and far between, and the cost of regrading was not very heavy. Sometimes, of course, it was darned inconvenient to have to do this repacking. However, when it was over, we felt pretty proud of ourselves, be - cause there is a good deal of satisfaction in a job well done, and a standard goal realized. While I may have dwelt a bit too much on the Blue-J Brand, this pack has been sold for more money to the trade than any I know of with no exceptions, and the quality has always been satisfactory. In a more or less remote way it has helped to make and create a better demand for all Nebraska potatoes. While the Blue-J Brand or Pack is our own, and was developed from a selfish standpoint, looking at it from an unselfish point of view, why can't we all work with the same thought in mind, and build a demand for Nebraska potatoes, regardless of brand. Have the trade know any brand from Nebraska is satisfactory. Now to make my point clear, I wish to advise you people at this time that we have bought and shipped this season, not only as good a Triumph as I have ever seen, but also the poorest. There is, of course, a market for all grades of potatoes. However, the thought in my mind is this- How much was the penalty or difference in value between these poorest potatoes and the best quality potatoes to the grower who produced them. I will quote you some prices on various grades at various dates during our shipping season and trust you can draw your own conclusions as to values. According to average prices taken from our files, I find prices on various grades as follows: No. One Commercial No. Two Grade Grade Grade November 75c 61c 50c December 74c 61c 52% c January 80c 60c 50c" February 75c 62% c 52.4 c These are the average figures and I believe they will correspond with averages of most local buyers for the same period. You will note an approximate average difference of 20% or nearly so, in favor of the next higher grade over the next lower grade. Now in checking these figures, (which by the way are authentic, as we have these prices listed in our files, and are available if necessary for inspection by any of you) we find an average price of approximately 20% more money for strictly _. S. No. i_ than commercial and we find about the same proportion in favor of the commercials over the No. 2 grade In these figures we find approximately 40% in advantage of the No. </seg>

Now here's a thought: This approximate 20% difference in No. l's over commercials and approximately 40% No. 1 price over No. 2, was secured with the low prices^of this season. The difference in favor of the No. 1 grades averaged about 12 to 15c per cwt on Commercial quality and 12 to 25c per cwt on No. 2 quality in favor of No. l's. On checking the amount of cost per acre for best grade of seed and the additional expense necessary in proper handling and harvest - ing of our potatoes, this spread in prices on the various grades will in itself pay all of the additional expenses one may have in using the latest methods and equipment, plus expenses of more careful handling of potatoes from the field to cellars and over the graders onto the cars. These figures indicate that we are wasting a lot of good dollars that might be secured from our potato crop. If by better methods we can secure a larger percent of No. 1 stock per acre, it seems very logical for us to spend, or should I say invest, a little more time and money in the production, harvesting and handling of our potato crop, and sell our potatoes as No. l's instead of commercials, or sell them as commercials instead of No. 2's. In doing so we are naturally helping to create a better demand for Nebraska potatoes, by. better! packing and better quality. This better quality package in turn will create a broader outlet which will increase our sales and in turn increase the return to you growers for your crop. I am sure that we have encouraged and increased the use of Nebraska potatoes this season through the-Federal Inspection. It has shown a.lot of us, including we buyers, just what kind of quality we had been shipping the past years. I have heard considerable discussion as to the merits or.detriment of the Federal Inspection service as it.now is. Both of these lines of reasoning merit con - sideration. However, in my opinion, there perhaps are a few errors in the inspection Service as it is now offered to us, and no doubt there always will be as long as the human element is connected or associated with this service, for it seems like we humans do make mistakes and errors in judgment at times. Regardless of the few errors that are made by this inspection service, it is, in my opinion, the nearest thing we have in the way of classifying the quality of any pack of potatoes and we do need classification of j some description with which to sell our crop. I am sure that you growers want to know just what grade or classification your potatoes come under. If you have a pack that grades any No. l's naturally .7 you want No. 1 prices. Without some means of classification or grad - |; ing your potatoes the buyer has all the advantage, because in most 7 cases these buyers may see more potatoes in one day than the ay - .'¦¦ ' ¦." _;' : . - -'-•¦' ,¦ . ..

Just like a horse trader— the buyer has a more thorough knowledge of the value of your stock unless the same is classified. So right or wrong, until a better method is advanced for classifying or grading our potatoes is promulgated, we need this inspection service for your benefit and protection, and the benefit and protection of your eventual customers on the other end. It will take the cooperation on the part of all of us, buyers, pro - ducers, farmers, land owners, and anyone interested in the potato industry to promote a better market for Nebraska potatoes. Not only you farmers in your production of better quality stocks, but the part of we buyers in selling and distributing your potatoes for you. I think the buyer here has a very important part to play in the mer - chandising of your potatoes. After all, the buyer or dealer to whom you sell the potatoes, is only your hired hand. He is merely working for you on a margin, or commission, or salary basis. Call it anything you want, but it still remains a fact that the difference in what your buyer pays you and what he in turn resells your potatoes for to the trade is his wages for handling the sales of your potatoes. Ultimately the consumer is your buyer. He dictates the prices you receive for your potatoes, not your local buyers. Therefore, it would seem to me that it would be very desirable for you farmers to be quite careful in your selection of buyers or hired salesmen. How well will he represent you on the other end ? Would he take your potatoes and misrepresent them to your customers or will he sell them too cheap? Will he make the right kind of deal to encourage repeat orders for your potatoes? Will he charge you too much for his services? Will he be fair and square with you and your customers? In making your selection of your salesman or buyer here this next season, I think it worthy of a lot of consideration, but in making this selection please have in mind that all of your local potato buyers are not crooks and slickers. I know that potatoes are a perishable commodity, and of necessity must move fast, therefore the busi - ness invites some undesirable persons, but because there is one black sheep in the herd, it does not necessarily mean that they are all black. There are a lot of good local buyers here in this district that have the welfare of the industry at heart, for after all, the potato business is their bread and butter. They can do no more good for themselves than they can for you. In order to secure all of the necessary market information, find new customers, and new outlets, and increase con - sumption of Nebraska potatoes, it naturally requires a lot of time and expense. It is too much for any of you individual farmers, with your own volume to handle, to find this outlet yourselves if you are to hold your selling expenses at a minimum. Therefore, there is a place for the local buyer. You farmers need this service and deserve it at the lowest possible cost. The buyer most desirable for you is the one that can furnish </seg>
         <seg id="p671">Nebraska Potato'lmprovement Association you the most possible service for the dollar you pay him. Don't begrudge the buyer margin. That margin is necessary in order that he 'continue to operate and find a market for your potatoes, and when some chisler. comes along with a lot of hot-air and false promises, don't forsake your buyer for these few extra inducements on one particular sale. After all, any article is worth its' true market value and there is no Santa Claus. Select a good salesman or hired hand and stay with him. He will make you money in the . long run. It is my sincerest hope that the local buyers and you farmers may become better acquainted with each other's problems to your mutual advantage. After all, the general welfare of the industry is a common problem, and should be discussed frankly and sincerely between the buyer and the farmer for the advancement of the Ne - braska Potato Industy. i .'"¦¦ ARE THERE BETTER VARIETIES OF POTATOES FOR WESTERN NEBRASKA? H. ]0. Werner : Horticulture Department University of Nebraska The people who once get, used to Triumph potatoes quite gen - erally develop a definite preference for them because of their dis - tinctive flavor. However, those who grow the Triumph potato know that it'is rather troublesome because of the susceptibility to mosaic, the long stolons and its extreme susceptibility' to mechanical injury when harvested in September and October. It is because.of these difficulties that Western Nebraska potato growers are more or less interested in the possibilities of using some other variety. Before making! a change a grower will, of course, want to satisfy himself that the variety that he will want to use will be .; better adapted to his needs than the variety that he is discarding. He must also be sure that there .will be a market for the potatoes. The growing demand for Triumph potatoes in the southern states has been a factor in Western Nebraska for a considerable length of time. Probably a red variety would replace the Triumph more quickly ! than a white variety could. Several hew .varieties have been developed by plant'breeders [during the last ten years. Some of these have been extremely .satisfactory in certain extensive areas but quite unsatisfactory in some other districts. It is probably impossible to predict the possibilities ¦¦'-'' of a variety with any degree! of definiteness until it is grown for [•;'..-. several years in the locality. Tests have been conducted in Nebraska {¦;• ¦.-'. , .'¦ ¦:.'¦'-'-. ''¦ .! . ' j "• '¦¦¦- -:- . I- :' '-.'.'"V;'"' '¦--.'" ;:' ¦'¦"":'.'' ' .... ¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p672">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture during the last ten years with various strains of Triumph potatoes and during the last three years the newer varieties have been grown in comparison with the Triumph. These tests have been conducted at Lincoln, North Platte, Alliance and Scottsbluff. The Warba, so-called because the name in Indian means "earliest of all", is true to its name as it seems to be the earliest variety now grown commercially. It was developed by the Minnesota Experiment Station. The tubers resemble the white Triumph more than any other variety known in this section. Marketable potatoes can be harvested about a week earlier from this variety than from the Irish Cobbler. It may be a trifle earlier than the earliest strain of Triumph- Nebraska 12. The tubers of this variety are very susceptible to scab and seem to be about as susceptible to all other diseases as the Triumph. The plants do not survive very hot weather very much better than do the Triumph. If hai-vested about the time the tubers have obtained maximum size or just after a period of rapid tuber growth has ceased, the type will generally be very satisfactory. At Scottsbluff we have found that if ftp allow tubers to remain in the ground long after the vines have ripened, they become extremely rough. As a result of second growth many of them become very elongated and on the whole will be a very undesirable lot of tubers. However, if planted very early, that is, in May and harvested as an early crop in August. ,„¦ if planted very late, that is after Juno 25 and harvested late the tubers are very desirable. Therefore, it seems that the Warba may be useful as an extremely early potato or for very late plantings but not for general use. In view of the fact that this variety is being used quite extensively in south eastern Ne - braska, there is an excellent opportunity for some one in the irriga - tion districts to grow this potato for seed purposes. On dry land at Alliance, during the last three years, it does not seem to have produced as well as the Cobbler and Triumph. The Irish Cobbler has long been a standard early white potato. It i.s probably the most widely grown of all American potato va - rieties. It endures heat more than most of the early varieties. The deep eyes have a tendency to become very rough under adverse growing conditions. It seems to be more susceptible to fusarium wilt The yields for this variety are generally very good but tubers are not likely to develop knobs as are those of Warba. It produces a great many more bushels of potatoes than any other early variety now being used but frequently the market quality of these potatoes is inferior because of the roughness of the tubers. . The Chippewa is a middle season to late variety and was de - ve oped by the plant breeders of the U. S. Department of Agri - culture. The tubers are somewhat flat, wide, slightly elongated and ' i white with very shallow eyes. It produces a good crop of marketable </seg>

When planted the 15th of June at Scottsbluff it has outyielded the Cobbler especially when No. 1 potatoes are considered. However, with plantings made at that date the tubers were immature at harvesting time and they suffered considerable damage due to the peeling and feathering of the skin. If it is necessary to use large.potatoes for seed purposes, one encounters considerable difficulty in cutting these potatoes be - cause of the scarcity of the eyes, jWe also have had some difficulty in getting good stands. If any one wishes to grow a white variety they should investigate the possibilities of this variety. Possibly it should be planted a week or ten days earlier than we customarily plant Triumph potatoes. The variety looks very promising for use in the central part of the state when irrigation is possible but it does not seem to have any merit in the southeastern part of the state. The Katahdin is a very popular late variety that is being grown extensively in New York, Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. It is a white variety of unusually good cooking quality and /shows some degree of resistance to some of the virus diseases; Because of these merits it was given the name Katahdin, which is the name of the highest mountain in the state of Maine where it was developed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. It requires a long season and therefore when planted between the first and twenty-fifth of June the tubers are too immature, at harvest time. It remains to be seen whether early plantings of this varitey will result in a more satisfactory crop. This, however, is not likely for tubers of such early plants are very likely to become infected with fusarium, to &lt;which the variety has been found to be! quite susceptible. This variety as well as the Chippewa is not at all suited to dry land culture in Nebraska.; . '¦''¦¦! The Golden isa yellow fresh variety which was introduced by the U. S. Department of Agriculture jseveral years ago. As'the name applies, both the skin and the flesh!are a golden yellow color. The tubers are an excellent type and relatively uniform in shape and size. They also show considerable resistance to scab. Tuber production is relatively late. Because of the lateness and the color of the flesh this variety does not hold much commercial promise. The preference of the American people will have to change considerably before they will accept large quantities of yellow flesh potatoes. Five tuber line strains of Triumph potatoes have been tested oyer a long period of years. As a general rule, the earliest strains pro - duce the highest percentage of good type tubers and the latest strains produce a relatively high percentage of elongated, oversize and rough tubers which are frequently quite immature at harvest time. The strains do not always develop a great deal.and their capacity to yieVJ, as a general rule, is not as great as of the-later strains. The </seg>
         <seg id="p674">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture earliest strain of Triumph Nebraska 12 is very satisfactory for raising an early crop which is to be harvested in August or September or for a main crop to be planted after the 20th of June. Strain No. 4 is perhaps slightly more productive but not quite as early. Three intermediate seasonal strains, numbers 19, 21, and 22 are quite popular both in dry land and irrigation districts. They seem suffi - ciently early and sufficiently productive without the disadvantages of the late strains. At the present time there do not seem to be any reasons why anyone should grow any of the late strains such as number 25 or 2.3 in western Nebraska. In the south the differences in these strains are not as pronounced as they are in the north. This appears to be due to the fact that under southern conditions the crop is planted when the days are cool and short. Under such conditions the plant develops tubers very early in the season and variety differences do not seem to be as powerful in delaying tuber development as environmental conditions are in bringing it about. On the other hand in the north where days are long and warm the late strains will frequently not set tubers for several weeks after tuber development has been well under way with the early strains. In the north large crops of tubers are possible with the late strains because they develop large plants that are capable of manufacturing a great surplus of starch when the days become cooler and shorter from the middle of August to the first of October. However, even though there does not seem to be a great deal of difference in these strains in the south, in-so-far as yield is concerned, the very late strains do seem to develop rougher tubers than the early ones and they probably should not be grown for that reason. Many southern growers are afraid to plant the very early strains because they fear that the plants are not large enough to produce a satisfactory crop of tubers. However, this fact has not been borne out by experiments. In the meantime, however, it seems ad - visable for growers who are raising seed for the south to stick to the middle season or secondary early types of Triumph potatoes, avoiding the very early or very late strains. This year the U. S. Department of Agriculture is introducing another very early white variety under the name of Earlian. This has been tested in some plants in Nebraska and may be promising. Another variety has been introduced this spring by the University of Minnesota under the name of Messaba. It is also an early white potato. This has not been tested in Nebraska but will be tested at Scottsbluff and Alliance in 1938. In our potato breeding plots we have a number of strains of early potatoes and of red potatoes that are being watched critically. It is possible that in a year or two we may have samples of some of these varieties of potatoes to send to commercial growers for trial. We, of course, will not distribute any variety that </seg>
         <seg id="p675">Nebraska Potato" Improvement Association does not seem to possess some merit or which is not superior in some respect to present day varieties.y For the time being, therefore, it'seems that in the North Platte valley the Triumph will still be the main variety but that the Warba will be used to replace some of the Gobblers or Triumphs for early potatoes, that the Irish Cobbler should not be discarded entirely as an early potato, and that the Chippewa be given some consideration if a white potato is to be grown. ¦ .-.'¦ ;• POTATO MARKETS FROM COAST jTO COAST ..'¦¦•¦•.', -: '-,¦'¦• - ¦. t '.'-"' -- Earle G. Reed j Supervisor Agricultural Development Union Pacific Railroad Omaha, Nebraska Out of G6 of the largest cities of- the' United 'States and four in Canada, Nebraska potatoes moved in carload lotejin 1936 to 29 of these cities. In only a few of these cities were Nebraska Triumphs, Nebraska Cobblers, "Nebraska What-nots", or any other Nebraska brands quoted. Yet Maine, Michigan, and Minnesota, our three largest competitors, are all advertising and featuring and quoting their.brands with state names as the prime factor in the-advertising. The largest movement of Nebraska potatoes to any city, ac - cording to U.S.D.A., is to St. Louis, Missouri. In 1936, 725 carloads were distributed in that city. Next in importance in number of car - loads received were Chicago 404, Kansas City 351, Omaha 290, Memphis 277, Cincinnati 141, and Oklahoma City 135. Next to grains, including cereals and flour, the annual average per capita consumption of potatoes is larger than for any other one food commodity. The use of course fluctuates with price.. Supply and demand, after all, make the market, but on the average we have been consuming about 2.8 to 3 bushels for very man, woman, and child. We have been producing about 3 bushels per capita. There is j: no reason under the sun why the people of the United States should j not consume four bushels of potatoes per person per year (consump - j tion in 1905-'O9. was 4.2 bushels per capita), and at' a price that \. - would be fair and reasonably remunerative to'the grower who does I a good job of producing the crop. The 1920 to 1933 average per capita consumption of dairy products was 377 lbs., cereals 226 lbs., all fruits 185 lbs., potatoes 163 lbs. The consumer is hot going to pay 2 cents a pound for culls nor for a hodge-podge pack of mixed grades, varieties, and sizes. That -brings up the question of potato marketing limitations. How many spuds will a people eat at a given price? Here's an example: A </seg>
         <seg id="p676">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture large, well known market in Omaha that is thronged with people any afternoon and jammed on Saturdays with that middle group of people who have to watch their pennies and make a nickel go as far as they can, offered a peck of potatoes for 17 cents. All done up and tied in a paper bag, a peck to the bag. You buy it, take it home, and then find out what you got. Seventeen cents for 15 pounds—that's 68 cents a bushel, a little over one cent a pound—they were Ne - braska potatoes. Those potatoes averaged more than 5 to a pound, about 300 potatoes to a hundred-pound sack. Out of every 5 potatoes 2 were almost too small to use and one was too damaged or rotten or unfit for food. That left on the average two good potatoes .ir 2/5. Two-fifths of 300 is 120. Giving the benefit of the doubt, say 150 out of 300 of those potatoes were good sized and usable potatoes. Seventeen cents a peck now becomes 34 cents, or $1.36 a bushel, or $2.26 per hundredweight. Cheap potatoes become dear potatoes and the potential potato peeler becomes a bean baker, a macaroni muncher, or a substituter. It has been demonstrated time and time again, growers, rural economists, government planners, and even armies notwithstanding, that people will eat what they want to eat. While the price is the fore - most reason for or against use of a food, the second reason is quality, and the third reason, and I think almost the first, in determin - ing volume of sales, is personal satisfaction. That involves both price and quality. The quickest way to reduce sales volume is to destroy consumer confidence through loss of personal satisfaction in a deal. As an example: A man goes to the market on Saturday and among other things he brings home a peck, already sacked and tied, of 17 - -eent potatoes. They're a bargain when the wife sees the ad the day before, they're a big buy when the man puts the sack in the car, but when the wife opens the bag that afternoon and with a caustic crispness and sarcasm says, "Well John, they certainly gyped you on these potatoes," John has lost face and potatoes have lost place with him. As a picker of potatoes he is zero. His vanity has been tweaked and potatoes have gone below par in that family. And no talked-, about calories, health, carbohydrates, minerals, or anything else will reinstate potatoes in John's mind—or with his wife. You can't sell cheap, low-quality potatoes on markets that are geared to high quality and reasonable prices in apples, grapefruit, oranges, and other vege - tables and fruits. On the average it takes the consuming public six months to realize that good potatoes are reasonably priced. So the people of this country are going to eat potatoes when they want to and the kind they want to eat. Therefore, it behooves growers to learn the kind of potatoes the people will consume the most. It has taken growers and dealers 101 years to learn that the consumers want their potatoes clean, they want them bathed, washed and scrubbed. Leave the dirt at home—the consumer doesn't want it. </seg>
         <seg id="p677">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association If they want a red, white, and blue potato, let's set out to develop that kind. There are a few kinds that we already know they don't want, a few that are going into gradual disfavor, and a few that in the last two to three years have become increasingly popular. Of the unwanted kinds, the old Blue Victor is probably the most out - standing example. Everyone who ever grew them knew their high - yielding propensity, everyone who ever cooked them knew that they were of good cooking quality. But if you cpuld grow a million bushels per acre and couldn't sell ten bushels—so what? People would rather buy something else than those sickly, purplish-blue, repulsive appearing potatoes. Contrast that with the increasing and popular demand for the White Rose or "long white" or "Shatter long white". The most popular eariy potato on the market today, yet thousands of growers will stick to the Cobbler or some other deep-eyed potato until they are literally forced off of markets for lack of takers. They'll do down, but with farmers everywhere still claiming they are, the best to grow. But thirty million consumers can't be wrong about'what is "the best to buy and the best to eat; for the money. New markets for old spuds is finally getting our attention. By new markets I mean new outlets. I'm inclined to think that we have done very little with the potato scientifically, chemically, and in - dustrially as yet. . Industrial alcohol is only one of the many products that are wrapped up in the potato peel. If we just have the genius,' : the skill, the patience, and the nerve, we will get the others. Several different kinds of alcohol are possible; starches, glues, lignin, and even fertilizer may be made from a potato. Last week I saw a lady buy several tin cans of shoestring fried potatoes—already fried—all you have to do is heat them, open the can, and serve—lo cents a can for 2y» ounces of potatoes. :That's 4 cents an ounce 0r,64 cents a pound, or $38.40 a bushel for the cooked potatoes, or about $16 per bushel for the raw potatoes. It's a wonder some smart farmers haven's started making canned shoe '['. string potatoes, french fried, and. other kinds. But it does increase j the possible market outlet for potatoes. It increases the storage and j ¦_¦'¦¦¦ marketing period. The Potato Corporation of Idaho at Burley is now I making potato flour, potato soup meal, flaked potatoes, and the j latest is a; dehydrated form of potatoes produced under a specially / patented process that can be sold in packages, kept safely for un - j limited time/and when placed in hot water with milk, butter, and j salt added and the product quickly beaten, the resulting' mashed potatoes i. are as fine in flavor and texture as any freshly boiled, I know because ; we have some in the house and have tried the blindfold taste test. Soon i they will have it down so fine you will not have to add the milk, i butter, and salt—just put the product in your mouth and you have mashed potatoes. They have dehydrated onion stew that way now, </seg>
         <seg id="p678">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture just one step in advance—just swallow the dry stew today and you still have the taste tomorrow for lunch. But we have wandered some from coast to coast potato markets. Potatoes are on every market in the country now. Modern transporta - tion, refrigeration, protection against cold, and scientific kowledge of ventilation have made this possible. Next to the tin can, the modern railroad refrigerator car has been the world's most important factor in feeding the human family well. Winter foods in summer and summer foods in winter and nearly all foods all the year around. Truly one of the most remarkable achievements of man. We go about our every day tasks, eat and sleep, but give little thought to this modern convenience, this device that moves silently and swiftly to and fro across the land. From field and packing house to market or storage, night and day, that man may be fed more abundantly from the land, that distant lands may be brought into cultivation and produce food. As great as i- the accomplishment in cooling or refrigeration, in heating, and in protection against cold, even greater still is the science of ventilation and its adaption to the modern refrigerator car. This will mean more to potato growers in the future. The science ,of modern transportation lias made markets —.potato markets—from coast to coast. Again, faster train schedules, greater speed, not only on main line runs but in yards, in switching, in icing, in deliveries, have all saved money for the producer, the dealer, and the consumer. Modern transportation has put more potatoes in more markets, more potatoes at less cost than ever before in our potato marketing history. Progress in transportation has always meant enlarged markets, larger volume, and greater prosperity. Progress in transportation has on.y been made when the railroads were sufficiently prosperous to attract new capital for new investments, for research, for experimentation and trials. Streamline trains, the Challengers, the new huge locomotives that easily pull 150 freight cars at 50 to 60 miles an hour, the new steam turbine locomotive now under development by the U. P., would not have been possible had it not been for someone with the money or the capital who was willing to stake it against a later return. The railroad as a transportation necessity, an enduring business, can, under fair treatment and competitive equality, serve this nation and its agriculture, save itself and the people from commercial and business stagnation, and be one of the biggest factors in helping agriculture and industry to new and increasing prosperity. Some folks maintain that we have done a fairly good job of merchandising potatoes, but the fact is that we have done a fairly good job of guessing and a very ordinary job of selling one of the best food products we havt. </seg>
         <seg id="p679">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association Most potato shippers admit that they do not know what the factors are which influence the demand for potatoes. One shipper will tel you one thing, and another shipper will say it's something else. Others blame market conditions, or over-production, high freight . rates, faulty distribution, 'too many services in marketing, and so on. No one seems to be willing to put their finger on the high cost of production. This is just another way of saying too low a yield per acre or per man hour of labor, or the high cost of poor seed, the cost of insect ravages, disease, and other contributing losses. Not until we have cut the cost of losses can we say we have done a good job of producing. Economical, low-cost, quality production is the first step in successfully marketing the crop. A crop well grown is half marketed. If stupidity were a crime, we would all be in jail. There is only one potato grower in 50 who is farming- as good as he knows how. . After all, we have got to have a demand for potatoes or there will be little profit for anyone in raising them for any market. One single, successful, scientific discovery, if practical applica - tions can be made, will make a political solution of the potato problem about as unnecessary as an electric refrigerator at the North Pole.

Carver did not ask for rules, laws, regulations, patents, or money from Washington. He realized that the only help worthwhile was self help. It may be hard to teach an old dog new tricks, but it's a lot harder to make him forget some of the old ones. After all, what the potato industry needs, as much as anything, beginning with the growers, is not new tricks but a return to old, sound, and practical ideas with the application of science, sweat, and sense put into every row, in every sack, and in every market.

Garey Dept. of Rural Economics, Uni. of Nebraska Nebraska's normal crop of potatoes is between 9 and 10 million bushels. Approximately 60 per cent, or from s\_ to 6 million bushels are sold off the farms on which they are produced and enter into the commercial channels of distribution. Of the potatoes marketed around 80 per cent have been marketed in five cities, Chicago, Memphis, Kansas City, Omaha, and St. Louis. Table 1 gives the proportion of Nebraska potatoes marketed in carlots unloaded in these cities for the years indicated. It is clear from data in Table 1 that the five cities mentioned are the outlet for a large part of the Nebraska potatoes that find their way into commercial channels. During the last ten years the chief outlets for Nebraska potatoes has shifted toward the southeast, St. Louis becoming the leading market. Cincinnati and Oklahoma City have taken increased quantities of Nebraska potatoes in recent years. </seg>

         <seg id="p682">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The proportion of potatoes unloaded in Omaha from the two northern states, Minnesota and North Dakota has been decreas - ing since 1927. From 1927-1929 the proportion coming from these two states was 23.9 per cent while for the period 1935-1936 it was 14.4, a decrease of 52 per cent. (Short crops due to low rainfall in the north in these two years had much to do with this decrease.) On the other hand the proportion from Idaho in the earlier period was 12.7 per cent while in the latter it was 30.3, an increase of 139 per cent. The proportion from Nebraska for the earlier period was 2!).!) per cent and for the latter 16.9, a decrease of 44 per cent. A pertinent question to raise in lieu of these conditions is why are consumers in Omaha taking proportionately fewer Nebraska grown potatoes. The answer to that question is not available and can be determined only by studying the demand for potatoes in Omaha as represented by different kinds of consumers. The results of a study of the demand for potatoes in Minne - apolis and St. Paul made in th-.- spring of 1935 offer some light on the various kinds of demand fo- potatoes likely to be found in urban centers. It was found that approximately one-third of the potatoes consumed in these .iti.s came from outside of the state in spite of the fact that a large surplus of potatoes is grown in Minnesota and that Minneapolis- and St. Paul are located adjacent to one of the surplus potato sections of the state. Four soui-ces were contacted for the purpose of studying the de - mand for potatoes, retail stores, hotels, restaurants and cafeterias, and hospitals. No interviews were held with the ultimate consumers of potatoes. Thirteen specified kinds of potatoes were handled by the retail stores. Six of these were the russets from different states. The Washington russets we,\- more popular than other out of state russets and constituted 20 per cent of all potatoes sold by the 1,356 retail stores interviewed. Slightly more Minnesota russets were sold than Washington russets, the difference of one per cent which can be accounted for by the fact that one local chain store owned a warehouse located in the part of the state where russet potatoes are commonly grown. Approximately 48 per cent of all the potatoes handled by the retail stores were russets, over half of which were grown outside of the state. Sixty-seven per cent of the potatoes sold by the retail stores were sold by the peck, 11 per cent by the half peck, 20 per cent in five and ten pound quantities and 2 per cent by the bushel. Some differences in the type of demand for potatoes in eating places should be noted. Hotels that have a high class trade have a rigid demand for potatoes, that is the quality and other character- </seg>
         <seg id="p683">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association istics of potatoes must be rather uniform at all times. The demand in restaurants and cafeterias is not as rigid as that in hotels because of a wider range in the class of trade. However, there are certain eating places where the demand is' most rigid but eating places of this kind constitute a small percentage of the eating places. The demand is least rigid in hospitals where the patients have little opportunity of expressing. their demand for a certain kind of potato or how it shall be cooked. Table 3 gives the proportion of russets and other potatoes handled by retail stores, hotels, restaurants and cafeterias, and hospitals. Table 3.

High class hotels and eating places provide a ready; outlet for good quality potatoes. Retail stores, be - cause of the wider range of trade which they serve. have limitations as to-. the j quantity of high quality potatoes they handle. However, it is quite likely that thru education the low purchasing power group would find it more economical to buy the better, grade of potatoes. ! Hospitals do not have much demand for high quality potatoes, |'-( hence the outlet for such a product! thru this source is very limited. It was! found in both Minneapolis and St. Paul that a larger proportion of good quality potatoes was purchased by the families with high incomes than by those with moderate or low incomes. The prices paid for the same variety of potatoes was higher for the families with higher incomes indicating a demand on the part of the higher income groups for better quality potatoes. As one. of the objects of this study was to find out why more Minnesota potatoes were not consumed in the two cities, the objections to Minnesota grown potatoes were obtained.

FACTS AND FALLACIES ABOUT POTATO*. by Genevieve Jeffries, Home Agent Scottsbluff, Nebraska The white or Irish potato is in a class by itself in the vegetable kingdom. Among roots and tubers, potatoes play by far, the most important part in the American food supply. The average consumption in the United States is approximately, four bushels per capita, per year. As to the composition—in round numbers, the potato contains two to twenty-five percent protein, eighteen to twenty percent carbohydrates, mostly starch, about one percent ash, and seventy- </seg>
         <seg id="p685">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association five to seventy-nine percent water or in simpler terms, about three - fourths of the potato is water, and of the solids, there is about eight times as much starch as protein, a little fiber, a very little fat, and an amount of ash which is relatively large in comparison with most other foods.* ; In experiments in digestion, it has been established that seventy to seventy-three percent of the j protein and ninety-two to ninety - nine percent of the carbohydrates is utilized. Thus the fuel value of . the potato is as well utilized as that of most foods and at least , seventy percent of the protein is digested and absorbed.; .-¦-.. Structure : Since the potato tuber is in reality a thickened stem it can be seen to consist of fairly definite anatomical parts: The outer skin consists'of a thin, grayish-brown, corky substance which corresponds roughly to the bark of an overground stem. In addition to the skin, a thin section of the potato held to the light will reveal three distinct parts. The outermost is known as the cartical layer and will vary from .12 to .5 inch in thickness. This : layer is slightly colored, the tint varying with the kind of potato. It turns green if exposed to the light for some time, thus showing ! its relationship to the tender green layer beneath the bark of an overground stem. It consists of about 8.5 percent of the total weight of the potato. It is more dense than the other parts of the potato and contains many vascular bundles, especially on the inner i . edge where a ring plainly separates this layer from the next. | . The interior or flesh of the tuber is arbitrarily considered as having two layers known as the outer and inner medullary areas. The outer one forms the main bulk of a well developed potato and !¦ contains the greater part of the food ingredients. The inner medullary area, sometimes called the core, appears j in a cross section to spread irregular arms up into the outer, so ; that its outline roughly suggests a star. It contains slightly more cellu - {.- lose and less water and nutrients than the outer medullary portion. The p medullary areas include about eighty-nine percent of the weight of | the entire tuber. |! --.'.-¦ . As: in all other plant life, the framework of the tuber is j, made up of cellulose. Cellulose forms a network of cells, which in 7 turn form the body of the tuber. These cells vary in shape and size in different sections of the tuber according to the part they play j' 'Editorial note: The potato is also valued because of the high 'content of vitamin C, iron, and a reasonably high quantity of i. phosphorous. Its most serious deficiencies aTe a lack of vitamin ;f ¦;! A and a low amount of calcium. '.-¦-7/ "¦..-.'.,'''' . * . ¦¦...--'.----¦-¦- * \ " ¦-.¦--'. . ¦¦' ¦-. ¦ ' . ¦¦- ' :''.-':' •¦.

Fallacies With so much to work with, and I'd like right here to state that a year ago, (rather a year and a half) when potatoes were a very good price in Nebraska, in the low price diets in this state it was found advisable to include potatoes twice a day rather than other lower price substitutes because of the protective value of the mineral and vitamin content. Still, I feel that very definitely, it is unnecessary and in fact, a bit ridiculous to proclaim loudly that potatoes are good as a reducing food. I've heard it done, and all it succeeds in doing, is to convince any one who knows anything about nutrition, that the individual is either deluded, or is deliberately giving out misinformation. I'm not saying that it can ;not be done. You can reduce on pure fat, which is the highest source of caloric value obtainable if you eat little enough of it. I am saying it is an uncomfortable and ridiculous method, so please, with so many good, sane, sensible facts in favor of our potato, let us stick to them.

         <seg id="p689">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association apply to changing production and marketing practices as well as to consumer demand. Consumer demand must be given consideration for after all consumers constitute your market. This applies not only to table stock but also to seed shipped into the Southern producing areas. You can already see that.the trend in the south in regard to seed distribution and competition from other table stock shipping areas must be met if the industry in this area is to prosper or survive. .A vital question in this area is the application of the grades to the variety of potato produced here. The Triumph variety, as pro - duced and harvested in the area, apparently bruises and cracks more readily than other varieties in this or other production areas. That is a handicap, of course, and will require more attention to time of harvesting, manner of harvesting' and handling methods to minimize this damage. Similar difficulties have occurred with some varieties of other products in other production areas. This meant study and chang - ing of handling methods to lessen the damage or if the economic sacrifice was too great, the variety rapidly declined in commercial importance and was replaced by some more adaptable variety. It is notable that many more thousand cars of Bliss Triumph potatoes are produced in the Southern states than in the Northern late producing states. Also perhaps to some extent at least because of different climatic conditions and harvesting and handling methods or both, they, seem to have much less difficulty in meeting the U. S. Grade requirements. The principal difficulty in this territory then seems to be that the crop is often dug too early before it is well enough matured, prompted by a desire to get it out of the way before beet harvest. Rough or careless handling has caused heavy damage from cracking and bruising. Many growers realize it and either have or will change their practices while others don't care or won't admit that the-situation could be largely corrected^ The question may occur to you as to what rewards may accrue to any region which has followed a consistent policy in connection with grading to high standards. While it is not possible or seemingly necessary to present definite economic data to support this contention, it seems that the question largely answers itself and can be disposed of by briefly stating that there is always some advantage to the indi - vidual grower or to the district as a whole of having the reputation of producing and shipping a high quality product. It seems generally accepted that a high quality product can always be disposed of to advantage no matter how depressed the market condition may be, while under unfavorable conditions a low quality product usually is not greatly in demand and, therefore, difficult to dispose of to profitable advantage. The direct reward for high quality might also well de - pend upon the sacrifice necessary to obtain and retain high quality standards. ; ! </seg>
         <seg id="p690">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture Some production areas may have natural advantages such as soil, climate, nearness to market, variety of product in demand or other factors requiring less sacrifice to attain than in other areas less favorably situated. This then brings up the question of the economic advantages, if any, to the grower for his entire crop by sorting out the better quality to make a good grade and then having a large quantity of inferior stock left on hand. This again cannot be answered specifically as we do not conduct any research work in connection with our inspection programs to defi - ltely establish whether or not there is any direct economic advantage obtainable. The answer would depend upon the percentage of the stock in the crop which is of high quality. The advantage would al - ways be with the grower who had followed practices which enabled him to produce a high quality crop and the producer of poorer quality would naturally be at a disadvantage. There naturally would be no advantage in trying to sort out the minor percentage of No. 1 stock that might be present in a crop of poor quality. It should be sufficient to point out that a grower who produces a crop of say 75 percent U S. No. 1 quality, 15 percent U. S. No. 2 quality and only 10 percent culls would undoubtedly and could advan - tageously sort and meet the U. S. No. 1 grade without difficulty and insure for himself greater economic returns than the producer of a crop of :,0 percent U. S. No. 1 quality, 30 percent U. S. No. 2 quality and 2l&gt; percent culls. Based on this or similar comparisons and on the normal difference in price between the grades, the better grower would realize from 10 percent to 15 percent advantage by grading and selling his stock as U. S. No. 1 and U. S. No. 2 grade instead of selling the whole crop as U. S. Commercial grade. He would also realize approximately 15 per cent more for his entire crop than the grower with the poorer crop who might also sort and sell his crop as V. S. \o. 1 and _. S. No. _ grade or who sold as much of his crop as possible as U. S. Commercial and the rest as U. S. No. 2 and culls. The grower with the poorer crop would, however, be somewhat ahead to sell as much as possible of his crop as U. S. Commercial grade and the remainder as U. S. No. 2 grade and as culls. Therefore, no matter how he grades them, the grower having a good crop has a marked advantage. There is always the marginal land or the marginal grower, who does not produce on a profitable basis due partly perhaps to unadaptable soil and climatic conditions and partly to lack of the best seed selection, cultural methods, careless harvesting practices and handling in sorting and loading. The prob - lem then rests largely with the individual. The one with the higher quality crop naturally does and should receive the greater economic returns. There is, however, the occasional disastrous season which may either seriously curtail production in a region or seriously damage </seg>
         <seg id="p691">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association the quality of the crop. During such a season a region which has, over a considerable period, built up ah enviable reputation for quality production, may he unable to substantially maintain the usual stand - ards. This may force the trade which handles such quality to obtain their supplies from less unfavorably affected areas. While an area might lose out to some degree in a single season, such a loss is not likely to be of much consequence should the succeeding season revert back to the normal high quality. The present day news facilities, crop &gt;' reports, advertising and direct reports of shippers and receiver's representatives quickly reestablish information concerning the quan - tity and quality of produce in any given area throughout the country. It does take some time, however, to overcome the ill feeling de - veloped toward a district which has established a reputation for con - sistently shipping poor or questionable quality. Shippers who send out plugged cars or who • directly or indirectly misrepresent the :...:.:. quality oi their shipments not only establish a questionable reputa - tion for themselves but also for the quality of the produce shipped I •'. from the district. 1 It is not intended that the inspector be a detective to { ( force anyone to be honest or to have to be constantly on guard j v against dishonest practices. He is there to assist in correcting un - | intentional errors and for the primary purpose only of establishing the | grade or known quality as a basis of protection and negotiation be - tween grower, shipper, carrier and receiver. Inspection on the basis .'.:'¦'•'.' of the U. S. or any other grades can be of no more honest value than the proper use made of it. Nothing has been gained but much t .'- harm may be done by obtaining a certificate bearing a certain grade and then the grower or shipper deliberately falsifying the grade by &gt; changing a portion of the load or successfully concealing some sacks _.-. _ of lower quality stock in the load. He may feel that he has been j pretty clever in getting away with it but eventually he hurts not only his own reputation but frequently that of others as well. Another quite! apparent mispractice, noted indirectly in the course of our inspection work, is the misuse of sacks bearing high sounding j ... brands inferring higher quality than is consistent with the character 1 of the contents. This constitutes attempting to over sell the shipment. j It gives the impression that the U. S. No. 2 or even sometimes the ( culls placed in sacks with these misrepresenting brands as being repre - sentative of the better quality stock produced in the area. Attempt - j ing to sell U. IS. No. 2 stock as.U. S. Commercial grade stock at j only a slightly lower price tends to lower the price for the really better I stock and discourages grading and shipping of stock which really i does meet the requirements of the higher grades. j Mispractices can largely defeat the value of the Inspection : Service to the user as well as reflecting directly upon the repute- </seg>
         <seg id="p692">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture tion of the perpetrator and indirectly upon that of the Inspection Service and the producing district from which such questionable ship - ments are received. Much more could be said along this line even to citing specific cases but it is of no point to cast reflections upon anyone. This is, however, a meeting of the Nebraska Potato Im - provement Association and the name definitely represents a directed desire to lend support to any movement or Service which will tend to improve the seed selection, seed treatment, cultural methods, harvest - ing, grading and marketing practices in this producing territory. It does not seem reasonable to believe that the majority of the growers or shippers in this area approve of such mispractices which definitely tend to tear down rather than improve the situation. It also is not reasonable to believe that the more reliable, higher type element in the community will sit quietly and allow the other element to substantially affect the reputation of the entire pro - duction area. The question presents itself here as to what bearing inspection has upon seed selection, seed treatment, cultural methods, etc. as re - ferred to above. The answer is that lack of attention to any or all of these factors may result in the production or harvesting of a crop of inferior quality. This would then make it very difficult to be able to sort the crop to meet the requirements of the higher L. S. Grades. It seems quite plain that the reason there is so much opposition to inspection on the part of many growers is because of their difficulty in being able to meet the requirements of the U. S. Grades. This difficulty is not so much the fault of the grades or stiffness of inspection as it is the quality of the crop produced. Incidentally, we find that of over 5,000 cars inspected since last October over 800 cars, mostly seed shipments, met the requirements of U. S. Grade No. 1 and over 2,000 cars, mostly table stock, could have been made to grade U. S. No. 1 by the removal of from 5 to 10 percent more defects. This indicates that there were many good crops produced which with a little more care in harvesting and sorting could have largely been marketed as U. S. No. 1 grade stock, The inspection work this past season, due to the various pro - grams involved, was much more complicated than usual. The Marketing Agreement required inspection of all interstate shipments amounting to over 5.000 car loads since that program became effective October 19, 1937. The Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation purchased over 300 car loads for relief purposes in this area. Their cars were all in - spected, the loads checked and cars sealed. A total of 177 cellar in - spections were made for the Potato Control Committee and Certifi - cates issued to be used as the basis for granting exemptions to </seg>
         <seg id="p693">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association growers to sell U. S. No. 2 grade stock. The Livestock Feed Di - version work, authorized in connection with the Marketing Agreement, became operative in this area December 22, 1937. That work being entirely new required considerable supervision and the services of three to five men to handle our part of it. Our responsibilities were the determining of the gross amount in the bins offered for diversion, examining of samples to arrive at the percentage of stock of U. S. No. 2 quality which was divertible and to accomplish the actual diversion by dying the potatoes as required. There are many details involved in this work, considerable figuring and many papers to be filled out and signed. To date growers have received payment for over 300 car loads of potatoes which have been diverted to livestock feed in this area. The growers generally, who took advantage of this part of the program seemed well satisfied. Several of them stated that they were going to try to improve the quality of stock they produce another season by using the money paid to them by the government to feed these potatoes to buy certified seed. Now that some of the faults of the industry have been mentioned, we can refer to some of,our own. We recognize that we have plenty of room for improvement and have every intention of doing so as the opportunity permits. This requires cooperation, patience and for - bearance on your part and recognition of our own shortcomings. Constructive criticism is always welcome. However, the basic principles of our service, of the establishing by an impartial agency of a grade or standard as a basis of operation between all interested parties, is sound. One of the difficulties in this state is the lack of trained personnel available to carry on from one season to the next| The present state law does not seem satisfactory as an agency with which to cooperate in this work.

         <seg id="p694">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture properly handle the work. You cannot expect very glowing results in this state under your present entirely inadequate state law and State Department organization. It is practically impossible to pick up a new crew of the right type of men for inspectors each season. Shippers say that only about one man out of every 50 tried out make good sorter bosses. An inspection job is even moi-e responsible, requiring more education, experience, and other qualifications to properly handle this kind of work. Such men are even more difficult to find than good sorter bosses. An inspector is in much the same position as the umpire in a ball game or other sport. He is there as an impartial individual to make decisions as he sees them in accordance with the rules. As in a ball game, many decisions necessarily are close but the issue must be settled definitely one way or the other. A good sportsman takes the close decisions in good grace while the other type will wail of un - fairness or that the rules of the game are all wrong, instead of admitting that he might be wrong himself. We have no interest other than lo play the game fairly and most individuals or organiza - tions in the fruit and vegetable industry are straight thinking enough to admit it. After all, the producers) the shippers, the government, the car - riers, receivers, wholesalers and retailers, after a manner of speak - ing are largely just the players in this fruit and vegetable game. The general public ur consumers are the patrons of the game who will use your product only if it so pleases them. We each have a part to play and the success of the industry depends pretty much upon how efficiently we all team up in playing the game. Grades and inspection have long been vecognized by the fruit and vegetable industry throughout the country as a necessary factor in the program. Confidence in the service is reflected in the more than 200,000 cars certified on an optional basis each year. The service can be of as great or of as little value to the industry in this or any other area as the honest use made of it. Whole hearted co - operation in using and building it up instead of persistent efforts to discredit and tear it down is necessary if the service is to be of the most value to the industry.

He won the distinction of the title by winning the state contest with a score of 90.1 out of a possible 100. Charles is a member of the! Bordeaus Potato Club and served 1 as Secretary of the Club this year. This was Charles' first year of Potato Club Work. The prize awarded by the Nebraska Potato.lmprovement Association for the State Chanfpion will be a free trip to club week next May. Twenty-one club members from seven counties took part in the contest. The contest was divided into five parts, show sample 10% judging 30%, sorting 100 lbs of potatoes 30%, identification ol j diseases 10%, final report 20#&gt;. .. ¦)¦ ¦ </seg>

Prizes consisting of certified foundation seed potatoes were awarded by the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association. A banquet was given to the Club Members, Leaders, and County Agents. "400 Bushel Potato Club" Eighty-eight potato growers entered the contest bjit only forty completed the project. Many of the other growers saw that they would not produce four hundred bushels of potatoes per acre so they did not ask to have their yields checked for yield. The names of growers who produced 400 bushels of U. S No. 1 potatoes are included elsewhere in this report together with a dis - cussion concerning methods used by them. Harvesting Demonstration Three harvesting demonstrations were conducted in Scotts Bluff county with ninety-five growers attending. A harvesting demonstra - tion was also held in Kimball county with two hundred and fifty people in attendance. Many of the people lived in town but were interested in the potato picking contest which was held in connection with the harvesting meetings. Harvesting operations were discussed. A demonstration was given to show the proper adjustment of a digger, value of using the belt and sack method for picking up potatoes, value and methods of padding baskets, and methods of emptying the potatoes from the sacks into the bins. Growers were given an oppor - tunity to exchange ideas and to ask questions. The picking contests were held to promote interest in the meet - ings and to demonstrate the various methods of picking up potatoes. The winners of the contest in each case used the belt and sack method. The pickers who used the belts and picked directly into the sack did not injure any potatoes. Where the unpadded baskets were used the pickers injured from ten to twenty percent of the tubers. News articles were published in the local papers, giving methods that could be used to eliminate mechanical injury of potatoes at harvest time and the value of the same. These news articles were copied widely throughout the country. Short radio talks were given each day at the beginning of the potato harvesting season. Result Demonstration Plats The result demonstration plats were planted in four counties in central Nebraska. These were Buffalo, Merrick, Dakota, and Holt. </seg>

O. Werner. At the time of the annual meeting of this association in March 1937, potato prices were higher than they had been for many years. The yields in 1936 having been quite satisfactory, in irrigated areas a combination of good yields and high prices brought in more money for paying debts and extra expenditures than potato growers had seen for many years. Except for a very few favored growers in small areas the dry land farmers were unable, because of the crop failure in 1936, to profit by these high prices. As a consequence of these good returns in the winter and spring, several fine new houses and other evidences of prosperity made their appearance on the farms of potato growers in the North Platte Valley. The drouth continued in 1937 and as a consequence the dry land crop was again very short. Throughout the central portion of the western potato district, the dry land crop was generally a failure except where it was grown after summer fallow. It is becoming quite evident that summer fallowing for potatoes will become an established practice with many dry land potato growers. A new departure in the so-called dry land sections in the neighborhood of Alliance and Bushnell was the sinking of deep wells and the production of potatoes by means of pump irrigation. Addi- </seg>
         <seg id="p699">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association tional wells have been put down during the summer and fall and in the 1938 season more potatoes will be grown with pump irrigation than ever before. Other dry land farmers are studying the pump irriga* tion situation quite critically. The cause of pump irrigation and the extent of the under ground water supply are two factors that are first thought of. Other serious factors which have not always been considered, but which, especially in other districts have been shown to be inescapable events, are the necessities of growing a variety of crops and of having an adequate rotation to prevent losses from disease and to assure the economic success of the product. Dry land soils will produce very large crops of potatoes if they get an adequate amount of rain fall. However, these occasional very high yields are pro - duced by available soil fertility which has accumulated during the years when rain fall or crop production was low. When the soils are sub - jected to heavy cropping every year some fertility may be lost by leach - ing and these high yields cannot be secured without resorting to the artificial means of bringing up the fertility. . Nothing o£ startling cohcern occurred in the irrigated regions. There were practically no psyllids present in most of the districts, and flea beetles were also almost entirely unknown. A great deal of spraying was done but it probably was unnecessary. Some of the early planted fields were killed rather early in September by early blight. A rather extensive region in the Dutch Flats district experienced an unusually severe epidemic of scab and pitted. Reports from growers indicate that this scab was severe on many types of soil and also on farms where long rotations have been used. Results secured by several growers during the harvesting season indicate that the Triumph potatoes can be put into cellars without a large percentage of mechanical damage that is commonly experienced. Authentic inspections revealed that a number of growers were getting potatoes info the bins with less than 10% mechanical damage and some with as little as 2 and 3% damage. Casual inspection of the potatoes in the cellars and on the market show that most of the farmers have not yet come to the realization of the possibilities of handling potatoes more carefully or of the financial advantages of doing so. Nevertheless, definite progress has been made along this line during the last few years- During the 1937 season the idea of a "Nebraska 400 Bushel Potato Club" was revived. A comprehensive report of this activity is given elsewhere in this report by T. H. Hankins. It is very interesting to observe that four out of fourteen men who grew more than 400 bushels of No. 1 potatoes are early potato producers in Buffalo county. The very keen interest in this activity during 1937 indicates that if the season is at all favorable quite a number of potato growers will enter the ranks of this club next year. </seg>
         <seg id="p700">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture During the past summer the Warba potato was grown for the first time on an extensive commercial scale in the North Platte valley and in various parts of eastern Nebraska. The growers who tried this variety as a definitely early potato were very well satisfied and we will probably see it used more extensively. During the 1937 marketing season a definite interest developed in the marketing of superior potatoes under definite brands. Several dealers report very encouraging results with such brands. This association has set up a program for marketing superior table stock potatoes under a brand owned by the association and which shall be available to growers and shippers who abide by the rules laid down for the use of this brand. No potatoes were shipped under this brand in 1937 but it is hoped that this project will get under way with the 1938 crop. The certified seed potato production increased in the irrigated districts. Southern buyers have become acquainted with irrigated seed and they no longer object to using it as they did a few years ago. No one can predict just what will happen when the dry land seed production again gets back to what it was several years ago. Very probably, however, there will again be a preference for dry land seed because with all other things being equal, a seed stock can be kept free of virus diseases more easily on dry land than under irrigation. Many irrigation growers who have come to look upon certified seed as a means of getting better returns for their in - telligent effort are likely to find that they can get just as good returns if they put equally good quality potatoes onto the potato market. The state legislature of Idaho and Maine passed legislation pro - viding for the collecting of funds by a system of fees for advertising their potatoes. Their campaigns got under way and have been of considerable value to these states in increasing the consumption of their potatoes. Other states are considering similar advertising campaigns. At least one effort has been made to start a national advertising campaign which will have for its purpose the advertising of the food value of the potato rather than to advertise the merits of the potatoes of any particular district. There has been some discussion in Nebraska but the consensus of the opinion seems to have been that while Nebraska growers have justly advertised its certified seed potatoes as being equal to those being produced any where in the country it has not yet reached the position in the table stock market where similar claims can be made. With the shipping of better quality No. 1 potatoes, much good might come from advertising Nebraska Triumph potatoes. However, potato grow - ers might well give this matter very careful consideration before in - creasing overhead expenditures. If every potato district puts on a </seg>
         <seg id="p701">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association very extensive campaign to extol the merits of potatoes of their dis - tricts the various campaigns may neutralize each other so that in the end the potato growers may not gain as much as the advertising agencies and newspapers and periodicals. ' The extensive developments of the early potato industry in the Shaffer, California district has been one of the startling things in the potato business during the last few years. The very fine appearance of these'potatoes, practically all of which are washed, before they come onto the market, is undoubtedly largely responsible for the popularity of these potatoes. As these potatoes are marketed in competition with the Triumph from the later southern districts the seed interests in western Nebraska may be affected by this California industry because of the possible decline and demand for Triumph seed potatoes in the Gulf Coast states if they cannot sell their crops advantageously. This possible disadvantage may be off-set by the use of the Triumph potato in California. A number of cars of Triumph seed potatoes were shipped out there this year from western Nebraska. .. During the fall of 1937 the departments of agriculture of several southern states were responsible for a conference in Chicago. This conference dealt, with the problem of how these states can protect themselves against inferior potatoes that are brought within their borders each year and which are represented as "seed" potatoes. They considered the feasibility of the southern agencies setting up certain minimum specifications for potatoes which would have to be in - spected in order to use the word "seed" in connection with any potatoes shipped into their states. It was recognized that these requirements would have to be fairly lenient. It was also recognized that in order to mean any thing they would have to consider the virus diseases and that some field inspection would be necessary. In order to avoid difficulty in getting inspection it seemed that it might be desirable to make arrangements; with seed certifying agencies in the northern states to inspect potatoes on the basis of standards that the southern states might specify. This so-called inspected seed should be superior to the common run of potatoes sold for seed purposes but would, of course, be inferior in quality to certified seed potatoes. The effect of such a program upon the certified in - dustry was discussed seriously but seems unpredictable. This par - ticular phase of the problem seems to have given way for the time being to other movements. A conference is being called at Baton Rouge on April 5 to 7 for the purpose of discussing certification standards that all southern and all northern states can agree upon. It is of interest in this connection to advise Nebraska growers that the prestige of Nebraska Certified Seed Potatoes and its inspection has been recognized in that Marx Koehnke, the certification manager, </seg>
         <seg id="p702">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has been appointed chairman of the joint committee of the northern and southern agencies and also chairman of the seed certification com - mittee of the Potato Association of America. Undoubtedly the seed buying states, which incidentally includes the eastern part of Nebraska, should take steps to protect the buyers of seed potatoes against any of the fraudulent practices which have been resorted to in recent years. In view of the present status of potato distribution by means of trucks, it is practically necessary that all states take more or less similar action. If this is not done, states with less stringent restrictions will soon become the dumping ground for the potatoes that are not acceptable in neighboring states. As the 1937 season advanced, it became evident that there would be a large crop of potatoes in the country and that prices might not be satisfactory. Consequently under the provisions of certain Federal acts, a potato marketing agreement was introduced by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Under the supervision of a control board which was made up of representatives of growers and shippers, an effort was made to withhold a definite percentage of the crop from the market. Under the provisions of other legislation growers who agreed to withhold a certain portion of the crop from the market were to receive a certain sum for all potatoes withheld. These potatoes, after being stained for identification purposes, were permitted to be fed to live stock. In order to work out the provisions of the marketing agree - ment, it was necessary to have Federal inspection of all inter-state shipments of potatoes. The U. S. Department of Agriculture has long considered the Nebraska legislation dealing with potato inspection as being very un - satisfactory. One of the principal defects is the statutory provision that requires collection of $2.50 per car. Their experience has shown that this is inadequate. After a number of conferences the discov - ery was made that the Nebraska law provides that in counties where inspection is optional, the state department may charge any such fee as may be necessary to properly conduct the work. In view of this provision and the authority given the U. S. Secretary of Agriculture, the fee in all so-called optional counties was increased to $3.50. However, there seems to be no authority under the state law for changing the fee in counties where growers had petitioned for com - pulsory inspection. After a series of conferences, an arrangement was made whereby under the authority of the Federal Marketing Agreement, inspectors were authorized to collect for The Nebraska Potato Improvement Association, an additional fee of $1 for work in these compulsory counties. All money thus collected was set up in a special fund in a Scottsbluff bank and was drawn upon for inspection expenses by checks signed by the Federal Inspection Super - visor and a representative of the board of directors of the association. </seg>
         <seg id="p703">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association Under the terms of the contract between the association and the U. S. Department of Agriculture, any sum of money listed at the termination of this contract!will go to the U. S. Treasurer. The inspection of all car lots of potatoes in the current market - ing season has shown that .a'relatively small percentage of the Ne - braska potatoes met the standards of the U S. No. 1 grade. Many growers and most of the shippers seem to have become staunch proponents of an adequate inspection service. In some localities there has been rather active objection to the inspection work. It appears that much of this objection is due to confusion of inspection work with the Marketing Agreement program and also to an adverse psychology emanating from the compulsory aspect. The Division of Fruit and Vegetable inspection in the U. S. Department of Agriculture has notified the Nebraska State Depart - ment of Agriculture that it does not care to renew the present con - tract because of "the undesirable aspects of the situation. As there will be no hope of modifying the state law before the next crop moves and as the State Department of Agriculture has no authority except that granted by this law, it seems that there will be need for some prompt intelligent and understanding consideration of this whole question of potato inspection. It is difficult to estimate the increase of prices resulting from these various activities but it is generally considered that they all had some value. However, perhaps none of these official actions con - tributed as much to improving the marketing situation for Ne - braska potatoes as did a calamity that befell the seed potatoes from a competing state. About- the middle of December in Florida the early plantings of Triumph potatoes that had been secured from North Dakota were generally found to produce very poor stands. This was due to an unusually large percentage of tubers being affected by some disturbing situation which brought about spindling sprouts. This was very much unexpeced. Certification authorities in North Dakota immediately withdrew. certification of all their Triumph potatoes until the exact status of the situation could be better determined. As a result of this condition and the wide - spread publicity that was. given it in trade papers there was a whole - sale cancellation of contracts for the purchase of North Dakota seed potatoes and there was a very active and extensive demand for Ne - braska Certified seed potatoes. (The entire unsold portion of the crop remaining in the hands of the certified seed potato growers in the middle of December, was sold within a relatively few days. The condition, of. the Triumph seed market during the month of January can perhaps best be described by the medical term "hysteria". All Triumph potatoes were looked' upon with suspicion. There were </seg>
         <seg id="p704">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture several rejections of Nebraska Certified seed potato shipments but these rejections were not sustained after competent official inspections were made. The whole situation, however, did cause shippers of Nebraska Triumph seed potatoes to be rather uneasy until they learned that potatoes were sprouting in a satisfactory manner in the southern fields. This spindling sprout condition has been observed in prac - tically all potato regions during a number of years. It seems that it may be caused by a number of different factors. At the present time, however, no one seems to know just why the situation developed so severely and abruptly in the potatoes grown in this one region In the United States. As one compares one potato season with another, there seems to be little difference, but when one compares the practices and results in years, separated by 30 and 20 years, it becomes evident that many changes have been taking place. In Western Nebraska there was a tremendous difference in the potato industry in 1938 when the 20th meeting of this association was held and the fall of 1918 when the first meeting of the association was held in Alliance. With more subsoil moisture in the dryland regions than has been seen for several years and with much snow in the mountains assuring more irrigation water—Nebraska growers are quite optimistic about the production prospects for 1938.

Prior to the Director's formal meeting they had been meeting with a small group of potato growers from the North Platte Valley to dis - cuss the feasibility of the organization taking the lead in sponsoring: the brand for superior table potatoes. As the sentiment of this meeting' seemed to be fairly well clarified the Directors withdrew to the mezzanine floor and discussed the proposition from the standpoint of the Association. The following two motions were considered and acted upon: Motion by Thomas, seconded by Ehrman that the Association sponsor a brand for a superior grade of table potatoes and to provide necessary inspection and administration service. Motion carried. Motion by Ehrman, seconded by Thomas, that the Directors of the Association request a special meeting with the Directors of the Ne - braska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative for the purpose of dis - cussing administrative details with the hope that by mutual discussion a system of inspection and administration may be worked out utilizing the services of the certification force of the Cooperative. This motion was passed. There being no other business the meeting of the Directors adjourned to confer further in an informal manner with the growers who were waiting to learn what action had been taken. H. O.

         <seg id="p707">Nebraska Potato Improvement Association MINUTES OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION October 26, 1937 A r special meeting of the Board of Directors was held at the Lincoln Hotel, Lincoln. Members present were Stenberg, Riley, Thomas, Ehrman, Walrath and Werner. The business of the day was to discuss ways and means of setting up some procedure wherety a fee of $3.50 could be charged in counties where inspection of Icarlot shipments of potatoes was mandatory and therefore limited, to $2.50. Under the provisions of the emergency-Federal Marketing Act and the Marketing agreement for late potatoes, inspection in the commercial sections became man - datory on October 19. In the non-compulsory counties a fee of $3.50 can be charged under the provisions of the state law. Mr. E. F. McKune, Federal Supervisor from Denver stated that it is not possible to secure efficient and acceptable inspection with the inspectors receiving only $1.50 per car. He stated that it is much more desirable to place inspectors on a salary basis. This matter had been discussed quite fully by Mr. McKune and Mr. Werner with State Director of Agriculture Buchholz and a proced - ure had been approved by both Federal and State offices concerned. This procedure planned to have the state collect a fee of $3.50 in non - compulsory counties,: all the money to go into the inspection service except the $1 going to the state out of which it in turn pays the Federal Department 50c and in addition to have the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association act as a collecting agency to collect an additional $1 above the. compulsory $2.50 fee in the compulsory counties of Kimball, Morrill, Dawes, and Sheridan. Motion was made by Mr. Carl Thomas, seconded by Fred Ehrman, that the Association enter into a contract with the United States Department of Agriculture to collect the additional fee of $1 per car in the counties where, inspection is compulsory under the state law so as to enable the -Federal inspectors to administer the in - spection work under the provisions of the Potato Marketing Act and that the Secretary be empowered to sign a contract in this connec - tion for the Association. This motion was passed unanimously. Motion by Ehrman, seconded by Walrath, that the Secretary in conjunction with Mr. McKune, make such arrangements as are neces - sary to accomplish the purposes of the preceding motion. Motion passed. Motion by Ehrman, seconded by Thomas, that Mr. Dwayne Walrath act for the Association in approving expenditures out of this fund and in signing checks jointly with the Federal Supervisor.

         <seg id="p714">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FIFTY-THIRD SHOWING OF THE NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY SHOW HELD AT OMAHA, NEBRASKA January 2nd, 3rd, 4th, sth and 6th, 1938 REPORT ON THE 53d ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF THE NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION The 53d Annual Nebraska State Poultry Show -was held in the City Auditorium in Omaha, Nebraska, on January 2-6, 1938, in - clusive. It was the most successful show staged by the associa - tion for many years. Preparations for the show were made long: in advance; notices were sent to the various newspapers, and articles were featured in the news columns of poultry publications throughout the entire country. Advance notices were made through the United Press and Associated Press. The Omaha World-Herald, beginning on the first day of the show, pave us pictures and feature articles every day until the close. Interesting people and unusual birds were pictured every day. The reporters were on the job continually, getting information and lists of awards, etc. The Omaha Chamber of Commerce mailed personal letters to the farmers in the Omaha trade territory, calling their attention to the show, and arranged for considerable radio publicity and two, inter - views with the "Man on the Street." Breeders throughout the entire nation were contacted by per - sonal letters and circular mailings. To sum it up, every medium of advertising known was employed. Entries began coming in several weeks before the sbow, and by the closing time, 790 birds had been entered. They came from every section of the United States from California to Pennsylvania. Fourteen states and the Hawaiian Islands were represented with very fine exhibits of many varieties. Several commercial exhibits helped to fill the hall, and the State Pish and Game Commission filled the entire south wall of the hall with eleven large pens containing many varieties of Pheasants, Par - tridge, Pea Fowl, and Wild Geese and Turkeys; this feature was widely advertised in the papers, and hundreds of boys and girls came in to see the birds, which they had never before had the opportunity to view. </seg>
         <seg id="p715">Nebraska State Poultry Association To the housewives, perhaps the most interesting exhibit -was the dressed poultry display made up by the Jerpe Commission Co,, Omaha Cold Storage/Fairmont Creameries, and Swift &amp; Co. The fowls were dressed ready for the pan, and attractively displayed in refrigerated counters. Large pictures illustrating the entire process from clean - ing to packing the birds, were mounted on well-designed backings, and were interesting and educational to not only the housewives, but also to the poultry producers in general. Arranged at the front, of the exhibition hall were special cages showing the champion: birds and live specimens of Gallius Bankavi, original jungle fowl from which all domestic varieties of chickens have come. These fowls were sent over by Frank Botelhd, fancier and superintendent of the Territorial Game Farm, Mokapu, Oahu, Hawaii. A. pair of strange looking Japanese Shamo Games also attracted a great deal of attention. They were shown by Chas. S. Y. Ching, a Chinese fancier from Honolulu, who has been exhibiting many high class birds in the territorial shows. The Japanese Shamo Games are a specie of fighting game birds, much larger than the average fowl. The cockbirds sometimes reach the weight of 18 lbs., and are being developed for broiler purposes. Another very unusual exhibit was made by City Commissioner Knudsen, also President of the Nebraska State Poultry Association, with a pen of White Crested Black Polish, an entirely black fowl with a large white topknot. A finer pen of this variety has never been seen in the middlewestem states. The iGrand Champion prize of the show was an 18 inch, hand - painted Chinese platter, which was offered by the Hawaiian Poultry Fanciers and Hawaiian Pigeon Fanciers Association. It was won by Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Winkler of Lexington, with as fine a White Rock pullet as has been seen in Nebraska for many years. The Champion Male of the show was a S. C. Rhode Island Red cockerel as near perfection as one would hope to see, owned by Lew R. Ellis of Hastings. Champion Pen of the show was won by Lyle Harris &amp; Sons, 4722 Meredith, Lincoln, on a grand pen of Australoips. The Best Display award is always one of the most coveted prizes: It was won again this year by Skinner &amp; Ronin, of Herman and Fremont, on their great display of Buff Orpingtons. The White Rock class was both larger and better than in previous years, and Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Winkler of Lexington won most of the high places, with Rev.- Schabacker of Arapahoe a close second, taking first with a' fine cockerel, and placing second in most of the other classes. </seg>
         <seg id="p716">Report of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture The Dark Barred Rocks brought out a fine display of birds, shipped from as far as California. Earl Jewell of DeWitt, Nebr., won most of the major awards. It was a very strong class, with many excellent specimens entered. There were only a few Light Barred Rocks. The White Wyandottes were again a grand class. Forestdale Ranch of Arcadia, California, won two of the firsts, Harry Sewell of Tulsa, Oklahoma, took most of the seconds. Paul Sanford of Milford, Kansas, carried off first young pen. The District Meet of the Silver Laced Wyandotte Club was a great success, as shown by the number and quality of the birds sent in from all parts of the midwest. J. H. Todd, of Villisca, lowa, won all firsts, with as fine a lot of birds as you would want to see. The S. C. Rhode Island Reds were one of the largest classes. The Weideman Red Farms of Kansas City came up and gave the exhibitors a great deal of competition. Lew Ellis of Hastings won first with his Champion Male cockerel, and John Klinegman of Ulysses, Nebr., took first on old pens and cockbirds; the Weideman Farms won the balance of the firsts, and the lesser prizes were pretty well divided. Weideman brought up a fine show of Rose Comb Reds also. As usual, Supt. Martin Norberg of Franklin came in with a fine string of Rhode Island Whites. New Hampshires were displayed for the first time at this show in numbers. Mrs. Axel Spader of Lincoln won most of the prizes, with the exception of first and second cockbirds, won by Clarence Weaver of Council Bluffs. I have never seen a finer lot of Buff beauties than the Buff Orpington class. The combination of Skinner and Ronin took the majority of the first prizes, with the exception of first cock. Col - glazier of Falls City and R. W. Laing of Blair divided most of the other awards. The White Leghorn class was not as large as usual, but had plenty of quality. Colglazier and Rev. Cholcher of Elwood took most of the awards, with Colglazier having the lion's share. W. H. Strnad, of Munden, Kansas, sent up a very fine pair of Light Brown Leg - horns. The Black Australorps were well represented by strings from D. D. Reese and Lyle Harris of Lincoln, and D. Z. Holcomb of Clay Center. Reese and Harris divided the firsts. White Australorps, evi - dently sports from the Blacks, were shown for the first time at this show. There was a fine display of Pearl Guineas from Pennsylvania, and a noisy bunch they were, attracting much attention. </seg>
         <seg id="p717">Nebraska State Poultry Association There were only a few Black Minorcas, but they were of really good quality. There was a fine display of Dark Cornish, White Cor - nish, and White Crested Black Polish. The Bantam display was one of the high lights of the show. The exhibitor of perhaps the largest string was Felix Gretteman of Templeton, lowa, who brought in many varieties and was winner in most classes. The Rose Comb Blacks, Black Cochins, and White Cochins made up the largest classes. The exhibitors came from near and far, from Washington to California. Clendennen of California was high in the R. C. Blacks; Vanous and Smith of Omaha, S. W. Schwerin, Jr. of Norfolk, and Walter Parrish of Aurora, Colo., split the Black Cochin and White Cochin awards. A new exhibitor with us this year was Ben Pollock, of Atlantic, lowa, with a fine display of large, well-colored Rouen Ducks. Our old friend, McCourt, also. of Atlantic, came over with a nice lot of Toulouse' Geese. Mrs. Clarence Patterson of Lincoln, also a new ex - hibitor, made us a very nice display of Embden Geese. For the first time in years, there was a nice show of Bronze Turkeys. Mrs. John Walker, of Williamston, Mo., won most of the prizes. . The Hatchery Class is always a feature of the Nebraska State Show, and one of the most interesting classes. Only birds from flocks supplying eggs to hatcheries are eligible to enter. The prime object of this class is to give visitors some idea of the quality of birds to be found in Nebraska Hatchery flocks. The class i 3 always hotly contested, and most of.the specimens shown are good enough to compete in the open classes.; The Nebraska Poultry Im - provement Association each year offers $100.00 to be awarded in addition to the regular prizes to the members of that association who enter the Hatchery Class competition. The association held its annual midwinter meeting on Wednesday afternoon, with hatchery - men from all sections of the state in attendance. It is estimated that from twelve to fifteen thousand people visited the show, and plans are now being made to make the next show a com - plete exposition for the industry, in which all allied interests of the industry will take part. —ERLE SMILEY, Secretary. </seg>
