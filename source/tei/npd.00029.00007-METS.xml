            <seg id="p020">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 19 Wednesday, January 17th, 1012. The meeting was called to order by president at 10:00 a. m. who delivered his annual address as follows: rRESS OP E. T. RECTOR. PRESIDENT OF NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. I Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the Nebraska State Dairy - 's Association and Students of Agriculture: It is with unusual ■ure that we welcome you to this, our 27th annual meeting. I unusual pleasure, because I notice here an unusual interest min - ed in our association. It has been my privilege to attend these tings for many years in the capacity of a member only, and you appreciate why it is an unusual pleasure and an honor to welcome to the opening meeting of this associaton as its president. Ilt has been the custom of our former presidents at our annual ings to call your attention to the progress that this association made during the time of its existence and to repeat, to some ex - the past histories of our meetings. tOur association was first organized in December, 1885, and has regular yearly meetings for the past twenty-seven years. We can point with pride to the fact that some of the most learned and ilnent men of our state have, not only been active members during lese years but have attended our yearly conventions and addressed om time to time on the live subjects of interest to our association, one most worthy of mention among them all is our esteemed sec - y, the Hon. S. C. Bassett. I We must recognize the difficulties of the earlier members In ing an interest in the association. History tells us that there was le when it was hard to get a quorum for the transaction of busi- Personally, we have been a member since 1890 and have at - ;d each of the meetings since that time. Each year we have ed a gradual increase In the interest developed In our association, at this time we are proud to say that our state university has ;nized the importance of our meetings, declared this week to be liday week for the agricultural students and requested them to d all of our sessions. In looking over the program prepared for us this year by our directors, we notice they have again prepared for us a program touch- 1 ing on, not only the live subjects of today, but also on subjects of unusual value to us as an association in the future. Tou will also please note that every subject of importance has been given to others, leaving very little for me to say to you in this opening talk. In this they are no doubt wise and, before we get through with my rambling remarks, you will probably conclude that In so doing they builded even better than they knew. We wish to say here that a committee from our association was </seg>
            <seg id="p021">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 20 tint responsible for the agricultural course at the Nebraska state university. After visiting the Wisconsin and Iowa universities, they recommended to the regents that a long and a short course in agricul - ture be established here. (I was present, together with a few others that we see here today 1 this association dedicated the present dairy building at the state i. our association being the first organization to make a regular ? of meetings at the state farm. Following our lead, many other nations connected with advanced and scientific agriculture have organized and now some sixteen of them I understand, are hold - their meetings this week In adjoining buildings to ours, almost in the sound of my voice. What this all means to the state of Nebraska will be told in history of years to come. It was our association that first established the cow judging con - test at our association meetings This is an educational contest and has proven very popular with our university students and will be an Important feature of our program tomorrow. Since establishing this contest many other states have taken it up and it has proven to be a very Important matter of dairy education throughout the country. Two years ago members of our association organized The Nebraska Dairy Cattle Breeder's Association. They will have a place on our program on Friday morning. This promises to be a very important department indeed, and we hope to see every seat occupied during their session. I Our association has always been first at the bat in everything that been good, wholesome, scientific and up-to-date in the advancement ducatlon along agricultural lines in our beloved state 1b all these KThis association has always stood as one body representing all the ests of Its membership, which is composed of dairymen, creamery - large and small, traveling superintendents of creameries, station itors. and cream and milk dealers and producers. We have all had one common platform upon which we could stand, and that platform has been for the encouragement of better methods, better dairymen and better creamerymen and at the end of each year we have met together and balanced up and charged off the errors and mistakes that have been made by our members. After fully and freely discussing the problems of interest to us, we have finally agreed as one man on all matters of discussion and then gone forward as the plowman of old, and never looked back. I take it that we have very little occasion to look back today. Let us now look forward, hitch our wagon to a star and work out at this meeting the present and future problems of importance to dairymen and creamerymen At this time,, we have upward of 250 farmer boys in the Agricul - tural Department of our State University taking a course in dairying </seg>
            <seg id="p022">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 21 it. It would not take much of a prophet to forsee the effect on association and on our state when these 250 boys return to their es and apply the knowledge they have attained here to the dairy to their farm. Through their influence and example there Is no it but what this dpartment will have 500 boys next year, and in tea * from now, if we mistake not, the Regents of the University will ailed upon to make preparations such as they do not now dream &gt;r the army of Nebraska farmer boys who will each year travel to ■ state farm to become scientific dairymen and scientific farmers. The year Just closed has been an unusual one in many respects. The price of butter, and consequently of butter fat, took an unprece - dented tumble early in the year on account of the heavy storage hold- Ings remaining from the previous year together with the general press agitation against high prices and threatened adverse cold storage legislation by our national congress. The early dry weather also helped to lessen the receipts of cream and butter. In July the markets, feel- ing these conditions, again advanced and rains became more plentiful. these factors again encouraging heavy production. The year 1911 will be remembered as starting in with low butter prices and a discouraging outlook and as closing with much higher prices and more encouragement to those Interested in the business than they have experienced for years. I am pleased to report to you at this time that from all sta- tistics we can get on the subject, the state of Nebraska manufactured in the year 1911, fully fifty million pounds of creamery butter. This means an income to the producers of this state for cream V alone to the amount of about thirteen million dollars. The records also show that milk and other products of the cow r produced and sold in the state to the value of two million dollars. This makes a total cash income distributed among the agricultural homes of our state of fifteen millions of dollars. Past records show that there were manufactured in Nebraska: Right here we believe it would be interesting to some, at least to know that our neighbor state of Iowa, which has always been held np to us as one of the banner dairy states of our Union, as shown by State Dairy Commissioner Barney's report for 1911, just out, made only 96,000,000 pounds of butter.

            <seg id="p023">22 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Eby those who are better posted than we; but it is a pertinent standing out clear and distinct, that the state of Nebraska no r has anything to fear from Iowa. tOnly a few years ago Nebraska was rated as the tenth dairy state ie Union. Now we hold the distinction of being the fifth dairy in the Union, and some equally conservative authorities place us e fourth dairy state. In previous years a good deal has been said about the quality of the Nebraska product. It makes especially interesting reading to look back over the records of former meetings and note what was said •bout the effect the hand separator would have upon the quality of the Nebraska butter Some of our best posted dairymen and creamerymen spent a whole day in discussing this in our 1900 convention and they seemed to doubt at that time whether a quality of butter could ever be made from hand separated cream that would sell on the markets of the world, at full price, in competition with the whole milk butter from other states. But, regardless of the doubts and fears then expressed, progress and development have kept pace with time and our Nebraska dairymen, knowing what was for their best interests better than any - body else, went right ahead and purchased the hand separators, and at this time we have upwards of 50,000 of them being used daily in our I There have been times during this evolution of the business a there probably was some occasion for criticising Nebraska butter, there has been a marked improvement made each year. IOur farmers have been each year producing better cream and our Dries have each year been making better butter, and we have ed in vain for any evidences to show that Nebraska butter at this i is not selling at the top of the market the world over in compe - n with butter made in the so-called "whole milk states" and we that our creameries are having no trouble whatever in obtaining highest prices. Investigation will show that their main trouble is etting enough Nebraska butter to fill their orders. tOn the other hand we do find some evidence to the effect that butter now being manufactured in three of the so-called "whole " and banner dairy states of our Union Is not up to the standard for fear of contradiction, we will read into these records a part His evidence which we found in an editorial in The Creamery nal of January 1st 1912. This Journal is the official paper rep - uting the creamery industry in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin, also called the "National Creamery Magazine" and is published at erloo, Iowa, by E. R. Shoemaker. Mr. Shoemaker's editorial here "A Humiliating Fact." »"The United States Dairy Division reports that out of 2,161 shlp - ts of butter they inspected the past year from Iowa, Minnesota Wisconsin, only 12.8 per cent graded extras. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">23 t'Thls fact causes us to hang our head in humiliation. Is it pos - that three of the greatest, grandest, biggest dairy states in the &gt; furnish the markets such a small amout of extra butter? It la to believe but nevertheless a fact which we have to face. The of every buttermaker and every patron in these three states d be wounded to the point of fierce attack and persistent action st the factors to blame for this deplorable condition. K 'While the shipments may not fairly represent the entire make ese three states, we have no reason to believe that the balance &gt; shipments were better. K'This is a serious condition and takes away our ambition to writ* what 'wonderful improvement' has been made the past year quality lines. t"But we are far from disheartened. We know that from the kin-head of all dairying, the cow, springs a product pure and un - ed and it is a question of man reforming man-made evils. The ? states of Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota are prosperous enough competent enough and well enough equipped to ship butter to the lets, 75 per cent of which will score 92 and above. "Nothing but concerted co-operation will bring about material reform. If we pay close attention to our own business and raise the quality of our butter to that 75 per cent proposition we will not need to worry about the centralizers. The competition of substitutes would also be eliminated. §The most deplorable fact of all is that we know we are wrong and mow how to improve, yet we remain inactive and, therefore, help - while sinking deeper into the mire of poor cream." I refrain from making further comment at this time on the present troubles of Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, as it would be unkind indeed on our part to do so; but, for the general good of the butter manufactured in America, we will say that it would be well if our neighboring brothers would come to Nebraska, attend some of our meetings and learn how we have accomplished our present results. I will now mention a few of the most important factors that have been at work for the up-building of our Nebraska butter and the de - velopment of the dairy business in our state that are entitled to recog - nition by us at this time. t First I want to give full credit to our state legislatures that have Led our present laws for governing and controlling the creamery dairy industry in this state. t These laws have been ably administered by our Deputy Food, r and Drug Commissioner, W. R. Jackson, and his organization of ictors assisted by the State Chemist, E. R. Redfern. Under their ince and supervision the business has grown and prospered until the records at the state house show that in the past year, 1911, issued 2,680 licenses to cream buying agents in this state. This means that the law Is represented by 2,680 men located </seg>
            <seg id="p025">24 Rvery village and hamlet throughout the state, furnishing a cash ket for every community and every milker, licensed and controlled he cute to see that a fair deal is given to both the producer and manufacturer. In this respect our state has led and now excels all other states la the Union. tit is with sincere sorrow that it now falls to us to notify this iation officially of the death of our Deputy Food, Dairy and Drug nissioner, the Honorable W. R. Jackson, which occurred Tuesday ling, January 9th, at his home, 1923 M Street, University Place. tier mention of his death should be made by our committee on utions. Second in importance to our dairy laws and their enforcement is the general improvement in the work that has been done in the past year by the station operators in Nebraska. From our experience gained by the employment of several hundred of these licensed opera - tors in this state, we feel like congratulating them on the general Im - provement they have made in their work. Especially are they to be commended for their efforts to make lawful and accurate tests. It is to our station operators that we must look for a square deal between the patron and the manufacturer and to the extent that the patron on the one hand and the manufacturer on the other are given a square deal, will the business grow and prosper. I At this time there are about fifty traveling superintendents In this &gt;, representing the different creamery companies. It is their busi - to first pass the examination and obtain a license from the state then to represent their respective concerns in soliciting business educating patrons and station operators In the care of cream from time it comes from the separator until it is delivered by the sportation companies to the factories where it is made into butter. le superintendents are equally desrving with the station operators full recognition for the good work they have accomplished in the year. (To those who are unfamiliar with the duties of these boys on the , it may seem that their position is an easy one. If anyone here ks life is a bed of roses when traveling over the state from town &gt;wn, year in and year out, stopping at all kind sot hotels, sleeping 11 kinds of beds and eating all kinds of food, we presume, if they d pass the examination and could deliver the goods as well, superintendents would gladly resign in their favor and take up a tion of milking cows or buying cream and getting acquainted with r families again. f have already made the statement that there Has been consid - erable improvement in the quality of Nebraska cream, and I have endeavored to give due credit to the factors that have done their part in bringing about this improvement; but we must recognize the fact that, as a last analysis, the care the cream receives on the farm by the </seg>

If hi* wife keep* the separator thoroughly washed twice a day; if she has the cream screw set so that the separator will skim a heavy cream, say from 40 to 50 per cent the year around, and if this cream is imme - diately set in cold water of which there is always an abundance, where the animal heat is allowed to escape before another separation is added to It, he will have taken the first precautions that a wise dairyman would take toward preserving the natural quality of hi* product. Fur - ther by doing this he will have returned to his calf and pigs ninety pounds of skim milk from each hundred pounds of whole milk run through his separator with the animal heat still in it, thus securing the highest possible efficiency from this finest of nature's feed for young growing stock. Cream skimmed at 40 to 50 per cent takes up very little room and, by keeping each skimming by itself until cooled and well aired, he is enabled to deliver to his choice of many licensed operators, if he Is selling at a station, or to the depot, if he is shipping direct to the market, a quality of cream that will make butter that will always score as extra and will help retain for Nebraska the position she now holds among the dairy states of the Union. fin our business life we daily receive letters from our friends and as asking for advice on how to produce, care for and deliver the quality of cream. Our answer has always been: I Clean, scald and air your separator thoroughly after each milk - skim your milk while warm from the cow; adjust your cream r to take ten pounds of cream out of a hundred pounds of milk, getting all the butter fat, but leaving practically all of the skim for your own use; thoroughly cool this ten pounds of cream in Ing water; keep the lid off your can and occasionally stir until the al heat is eliminated and, when you separate again, cool the next ation in the same manner before you mix the two. Then deliver e market two times a week in winter and three times a week in ner. You will then have complied with regulation number 60 and section 9835 of the Nebraska Statutes of 1909. KThe rest of the responsibility will then rest with the manufac - ', who will gladly pay you the highest market price for your net at all times of the year. Our association being composed of dairymen, station operators, superintendents and creamerymen, it is only fair to those who are fur - nishing the daily cash market for the product of these 50,000 separ - ators to give them due credit for their part in the development and upbuilding of this industry of which we are so Justly proud. Being classed with the manufacturers, I can say from personal experience </seg>
            <seg id="p027">26 that since 1890 we have (pent every week day of our life and "too many Sundays" in devising ways and means for the manufacture of these rivers of cream into butter that we could sell on its merits in the markets of the world and pay the producer a price that would en* courage him to milk more and better cows, take better care of his cream and sell more of it. I At this time allow me to point with pride to the butter factories have been erected in our state in recent years and the machinery has finally been perfected for the manufacture of Nebraska butter. Ill say that nowhere in the world have they factories that equal « in Omaha, Lincoln, Crete, Grand Island and many other points re butter is manufactured in our state. Millions of dollars are now sted in permanent buildings many stories in height and in machin - not equalled in the world for the manufacture of creamery butter. II wish this audience could take a trip with us today through e of the factories that have been recently erected specially for manufacture of Nebraska butter and then through the large pack - houses of South Omaha. You would then agree with ua that the merles of today compare with the creameries of twenty years ago he packing houses of today compare with the country slaughter tea of twenty years ago. I You would find in our large factories in charge of the various de - ments there, expert mechanics and electricians, bacteriologists, nists and scientists who have been chosen especially for this work d the highest institutions of learning in the world. You would thousands of men employed. KYou would see carloads of pasteurized creamery butter of uniform ity, scientifically manufactured daily, where a few years ago it was possible to manufacture but a few hundred pounds daily and it of try questionable and un-uniform quality. You would find brains led where brawn was the main requisite twenty years ago. tThe creamerymen in this state who have devoted their lives to building up of these immense factories and the millions of dollar* msineFs that goes through them annually, certainly deserve full it and the best evidence that we can give that they are getting It, T pointing to the healthy increase in production from year to year they are receiving from their patrons, many of whom have been heir books continually for a generation. tWe hear and read a great deal at this time about the conserva - of the nation's natural resources, and we take it that we are all ested at this time in the conservation of the natural resources of aska. We can think of nothing that will accomplish as much ; this line as the silo. In fact every owner of a hand separator in state is only getting one-half of the returns from his cows that he d get if he owned a silo and through the silo, the old cow and the 1 can converted and turned into money the natural growth or fodder and other feed that heretofore has been raised every year. </seg>

II wish to call your attention at this time to the importance of ig some action at this meeting concerning the establishment of arse of agriculture in our public schools, including a course In the entary principles of dairying and the practical use of the Bab - tester. In this matter our' state and our associations are a bit behind some of our sister states. Minnesota already has established this branch in their public schools and Oregon, under the leadership of L. R. Alderman, state superintendent of public instruction, is at this time working to es - tablish this course in that state. I am pleased to note that Blair, Tecumseh and Holdrege have already felt the importance and necessity of teaching advanced agri - culture in their public schools and, according to press reports. Pro - fessor J. G. McMillan, a graduate of the Ames, Iowa Agricultural College has been elected to teach agriculture in the high school at Holdrege. . I notice we are going to have an address from Professor V. S. Culver on "Dairy Instruction in Secondary Schools" and an address from Professor W. L. French on "Dairy Instruction in Agricultural Colleges and Normal Schools." Both of these gentlemen are much better prepared to talk on the subject than the speaker, so we will leave it for them to enlighten you from their experience as to how this can best be brought about. I feel that I have already taken up my full share of the valuable time that we will need for discussing the important problems before us, and I will close my address by paying the following tribute to her Majesty the Dairy Cow of Nebraska: "Most potent of all single influences in the building of this mightiest nation in history is the Cow.

            <seg id="p031">30 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN S ASSOCIATION DAIRY EDUCATION IX SECONDARY SCHOOLS. V. S. Culver En this day, with the call, back-to-the-land, being sounded on hand, the dairyman is beginning to look about to see what part ay play in this great movement. And his is an important part, yed properly. tit has so often been said, where there is a dairy cow, there we a home. Since the great object of our educational system is to le people to establish better homes, in which to raise up children e better citizens; therefore; the dairy cow, better homes, and r schools with all efforts united will produce the better citizens, we see that the question of first importance ie the dairy cow, the •ct knowledge of her structure, her needs, and her products, and ■ other much sought objectives will then follow in their logical Of the children of school age in this state ninety per cent of them get no higher education than is offered in the rural schools or the eighth grade. Only eight per cent complete the high school course. These statistics show us at once where we must go to educate the bulk of our people. To the rural schools and the lower grades. In regard to this, Ex-Governor Hoard says:. "Elements of scientific agricul - ture and dairying are not taught in the common schools, consequently, so few farmers read agricultural periodicals and bulletins, and those that do read, often fail to understand them as they should. Dairying is an intellectual as well as manual pursuit. Ignorance stands as a bar to the dairyman's progress, hence Educate." Agricultural knowledge cannot reach the great body of rural people except through local schools. The state College of Agriculture eceomodate only one-fifth of one per cent of the farm boys and girls who are preparing to enter the vocations of the farm and farm home making. The greatest good to the greatest number should be the aim of our educational system. Therefore we should endeavor to teach the essential things of dairying and agriculture along with reading, writing and arithmetic, instead of postponing this important side of the education to the college and university, or even to the high school to which only the chosen few are privileged to attend. We must take f uch education to the people, which will be easier and will accomplish far greater and quicker results than to wait for the people to come to such education. Ekeep the boys and girls on the farm is our great problem. To one must get, and keep their interest in farm things rather t them become interested in the things of the city. You have 1, without doubt, of the wonderful work accomplished along ft, by Miss Jessie Field. County Superintendent of Page County, It Is miraculous, the work she has done throughout the entire and the Interest she has created in the farm and life. Nearly every child in the county is -interested </seg>
            <seg id="p032">31 I at least one phase of agriculture. If it is not corn ing, it is the school garden, or pig feeding etc. In if their arithmetic, instead of studying about the grocer Belling m. of sugar @ seven and a half cents per pound, they work out lems, like, John Smith raised 125 bushels potatoes per acre, and }ld the yield from four acres at 62 cents per bushel. How much le get for his crop of potatoes? They study how to measure land, is of various kinde of hay, cribs of corn, and to find the amount itter fat in a given amount of milk testing a certain per cent. AH leir school work is so important and so practical. No time is ted on unimportant details and the study of subjects, the know - ; of which will be of absolutely no service to any one. The place to begin such education is in the little rural school houses right here in Nebraska, where the children have the best en - vironment to study things of nature, and while they are of the concep - tive age. In these little one room school houses, dear to the hearts of all, as the foundation of our great educational system, the chil - dren can be taught at a very early age about our foster mother, the old cow and her products. The smaller children along with their other nature study can learn of the different position the cow takes when lying down or getting up, how she pulls the grass with her tongue, the different colors of cows, how she hides her baby calf and such simple things that will interest them in so important a subject. Later on they will study what the cow eats, how she digests her food of her four stomachs and other important physiological points. Then will come the study of her products, how she secrets milk, the testing of milk and its products as well as their manufactury. A little dairy bacteriology could be introduced now in a simple way. discussions of tuberculosis and other diseases of the cow, principles of feeding, of breeding, and the judeire of dairy stock. Not only would the teach - ing of these subjects serve the purpose of bringing such important, practical information to the great body of rural people, but it would create such an interest in the boys for dairying and agriculture, that they would want to come to school and stay in school as long as pos - sible in order to get more knowledge to use, later on their own farms. KBut you are saying: Where are we to get the teachers who can h all these important subjects? We shall have to train them, essor French will tell us of this important work. The course briefly mentioned above could be taught to a fair degree of success in our little one room school houses, but to so much greater advantage in the consolidated rural school, where there would be several teachers employed, one of which would have a good agri - cultural and dairy training. The consolidated rural school has proven a wonderful success where ever tried. Minnesota leads on this class of schools and their work can not be praised too highly by their pa - trons. In the United States over six hundred such schools have been organized, and not one but which has more than met the expectations </seg>
            <seg id="p033">32 of their supporters. Each eight or ten, or a leas number of rural dis - trict! are grouped into one. The children are conveyed to and from school at public expense. The buildings are well heated, lighted and ventilated and are equipped with the most up-to-date apparatus for teaching. Each of the teachers employed are specialists along their line of work. The money spread out over several districts is brought together and accomplishes so much greater results. And what we are after in our educational system is results, especially, we dairymen want practical results. So I am going to continue the rest of this paper, from the standpoint of the consolidated rural school, which will bring about these, so much desired results. The youth in the rural school is kept in close touch and can be easily Interested in the every day things about him, through his asso - ciation with these common things. "The association of the boy with good animals is very Important," says Professor Hart of Amherst, often the lack of horse sense, so much complained about, may be in a great part due to a lack of the proper association with good horses at the right time. The association with the dairy cow has a wonderful effect upon the boy. Is there not a connection between good morals and cows, when milkmen are forbidden to lose their tempers or swear in the dairy barn on penalty of their Job?" A practical, scientific knowledge of these every day things, the soil, which the boy helps to plow or hoe, the plants, which he helps to plant and watches grow, or the animals which he feeds, a more correct knowledge of these, only causes the child to have a greater love for the farm. The first thing then is to have a well equipped consolidated rural school, with one of the teachers thoroughly trained in dairying and agriculture. AH of the teachers should be in love with the farm and in thorough sympathy with the people on the farms. A good agricultural library, with some of the best dairy reference books, could easily be supported in such a school. And upon the shelves should always be found such great dairy papers as Hoards Dairyman, Kimballs Dairy Farmer and the leading general farm papers, with at least one good paper representing the local agricultural conditions. The smallest tots in school if encouraged by the teacher, will become interested in these papers because of the many excellent pictures in them. This will arouse their interest In good animals, and also aid in fixing in their mind the type of desirable animals, although, they will be uncon - scious of it at the time. As the youth begins to read he will want to read about the pictures that interest him, and from this will develop a love for dairy and agricultural literature. This will aid in fixing upon the youth the good habit of reading good agricultural papers and "when he gets old he will not depart the way therefrom." With such a library the children will learn to distinguish first class agricultural leading from the cheap and the poor. Bulletins from, the state experi - ment station and the United States department of agriculture should </seg>
            <seg id="p034">33 also be in Eucb a school, and with the teachers' aid, the youth will learn to read such work understanding!?. I Not forgetting again the importance of association with good gs, upon the walls of this consolidated rural school house will hang w first class pictures of typical farm animals. Certainly a good pic - of Katy Gerben, Jacoba's Irene, or Dairymaid of Pinehurst, would se in the breast of almost any youth, a love for the beautiful and useful, as well as a desire to some day possess and know how to for such lovely animals. The possibilities along these lines are &gt;st infinite. tThe class of instruction should be suited, largely, to the commun - i which the school is located. If the producing and selling of whole is the principle business, then special efforts should be put forth iow the importance of clean and sanitary milk. If cheese making e most important industry then that side should be thoroughly lasixed. I These consolidated schools would not only serve to teach the g the practical as well as the scientific side of dairying, but they d also be a stimulus to the parents in their work. The school house d be the center of the community, educationally, politically and lly. Through it co-operative societies of all kinds would be formed, testing associations, corn improvement clubs, alfalfa clubs, silo i, pure bred sire clubs and good road associations The leading po - 1 questions would here be discussed and debated, while a T. If. a T. W. C. A. could do wonderful work in such a home, with so hful and wholesome young people as every such rural school dis - could boast of. From such a consolidated rural school, we will go to the agricul - tural high school, of which there will be one in each county. This school will be supported partially by the state and partially by the county, as this method will create a much greater local interest, than if supported by the state alone. tSuch schools will first be organized In counties where the people terate and realize the importance of such a system. In the beginning or more counties may concentrate their forces and build and or - te such a school together, locating it at as convenient a place as ble. The course in these high schools will have the practical side still very prominent. It will be merely a continuation of the work carried on in the consolidated rural school. Simply a step higher. These schools will have, of course, a more complete equipment and will do a more scientific work. Boys from such a school should be able to carry on advanced registry tests for the pure-bred dairy breeders of the county, and take charge of the numerous cow testing associations which it could form. A small commercial dairy could be run in con - nection with such a school, which would support itself. And the students </seg>
            <seg id="p035">34 doing a large share of the work, would certainly get the practical aide of dairying. To such a school every farmer and dairyman of the county would come for advice and the school would gladly co-operate with him in any line of work he might wish to undertake. These agricul - tural high schools would also co-operate with the rural schools of the county, giving advice, furnishing instructors and often times material with which to work. For example, one such school in Wisconsin, grows various shrubs in its horticultural department, which they send out to decorate the grounds of the rural schools of the county. These high school* would be the headquarters of the county agricultural society, the county co-operative insurance companies, etc. — in fact, the cen - ter of the county's interest much as the consolidated rural school would be the center of its district's interests. From these schools would also come many of the teachers to take up the work in the rural schools, and, contrary to present conditions, they would be properly fitted to teach the farm boys and girls, back-to-tlie-farm. I These plans which are set before you are not the dreams of a mer, they will not fade away when we once wake up to the Itions and possibilities before us, but instead if they are proper - ied. everyone will prove successful. As was stated earlier, Minno - and several other states have been exceedingly successful with the &gt;lid«ted rural school. Wisconsin has proven beyond a doubt a few e many possibilities of the county agricultural high school, for ?he has twelve booming ones and still more are being organized. Eng - has a very similar system as is outlined in this paper, and not once e it has been tried has there been a failure. The field of opportunities is certainly great along this line. I have only hit the high places of a few of the possibilities before us. Nebraska, as we all know, is purely an agricultural state, lying in the heart of America's most fertile district. •Climatic conditions and the water of the state, are such that we are foremost in dairy pro - duction. Omaha at the present time being the largest butter market of the world, as well as the greatest milk and cream depot. We are also in first rank with our educational system, but there is much room for improvement. Over 2,000 farmers have testified to this lust statement, in answer to letters sent out to them, by the Rural Life Commission. This body of broad minded men, the Farmers Con - gress, and all good citizens who have investigated these problems are working towards the establishment of such a school system, through publicity, education and legislation.

I Before a legitimate excuse can be given for asking an individual ommunity to spend time or money in pursuing any line of edu - &gt;n we must show conclusively and without the question of a &gt;t that the information and skill acquired by pursuing such a se of instruction will be a benefit to himself, his community, or umanity at large. To an audience composed of farmers and ymen, it would be out of place to discuss at length the defend - proposition that the intelligent study and practice of dairy hus- Iry would be worth the time and effort from the general train - and development that a person, mastering this branch of science Id secure. It might be well, however, to point out that few lines of voca - tional education are so well adapted to develop an all around man as a thorough training in dairying would give. From an intellectual point of view its scope is unlimited. It reaches into the most intri - cate problems of the fundamental sciences, both physical and biologi - cal. It Involves the absorbing features of the development of new types, forms and functions of plant and animal life. It crosses and recrosses the questions of nutrition both in its aspects to the raw food into milk, and milk in its relation to human food. It throws wide-open the doors to the study of the diseases of plants, farm ani - mals and human beings. In fact the intelligent independent dairy - man must have a general understanding of the application of these sciences in order to save himself from ruin in the common practice of producing dairy products or in the successful management of dairy I The study and practice of dairy husbandry affords a splendid for the development of executive ability. Not only must the man be well equipped with definite knowledge but he must be r at all times to act quickly and with precision upon questions tal importance. How often can we trace financial ruin to the duction of a diseased animal into the herd, the failure of a long shed ambition by the selection of an important sire or the good s and business standing of a dairyman by the careless dlstribu - of an inferior quality of milk or butter to his patronage. In his relation to the community in which he lives, the dairy - man occupies a unique position. His name is the safeguard to the baby's bottle, or it is engraved as an epitaph upon its tombstone. It is swallowed with an ardent grunt with each glass of pure sweet milk or it is spewed from a contorted mouth when a sickened stom - ach revolts against an unwholesome flavor. It takes a man of parts to maintain a position of respect and honor under all the trying cir - cumstances he meets in catering to a patronage with a retail milk </seg>

(Leaving out of consideration anything but the material phase e subject, we believe that Nebraska farmers should engage more y in dairying than they are at present, because it is more table than almost any other line of farming that is practical r our conditions. We have reached the point where our land ss demand greater returns than they did a few years ago. We it demonstrated to our complete statsfaction that the fertility ir soils must be conserved. The average returns of grain farm - are steadily decreasing and the profits, are proportionately aishing. Just as sure as one from five leaves four, as one from leaves three, as one from three leaves two, that sure are we that our annual drain of soil fertility will result in bank - ruptcy unless we do something to throw back to the soil this annual loss. A recent report on conditions in Denmark illustrates this point. Sixty years ago Denmark's source of revenue was the grain her fields would produce. She finally reached a point where the soil became so depleted that it would not feed her people. Forced into other methods she turned her attention to the production of beef and milk. Gradually but completely has the pro - duction of milk supplanted that of beef until today, having the largest •mount of money per capital of any European nation, she looks back over the last half century to the time when starvation stared her in the face and thanks her lucky stars that through the dairy cow she was able to draw a large measure of wealth and comfort and return to the soil the great bulk of fertility which should never be allowed to get further from home than the gutter in the dairy barn. IThe work of producing the feed, raising the dairy stock, feed - and milking the cows and turning the milk into a marketable 1 affords two things very much to be desired by the farmers of state. First, it is an all year round employment, affording a means iipport regardless of seasons, frosts, droughts or rainfall. Second, work is of such a nature that every member of the family from 1" clear down to little Dot can each bear &amp; responsible part. Only one thing stands in the way of any farmer to begin at once upon this kind of farming. Namely, "knowing how." It Is a shame that our boys and girls are required to spend eight or nine years in the grades, four years in the High School and maybe four years more in a university to learn, "amo, amamus, araat," "the great achievements of Demosthemes or Cicero" or " to extract the cube root of 8,467,975," while they never hear a word about the fact that if old Boss were fed a balanced ration of corn, bran and oil meal with plenty of alfalfa and warm water to drink, she would produce enough milk to buy a new pair of shoes every three days. With these facts in mind in regard to the need for instruction </seg>
            <seg id="p038">37 in dairying, I wish to point out the responsibilities that fall upon the Agricultural colleges and Normal Schools. The work of these two institutions is in no way similar. The colleges and experiment stations must take the initial steps of investigations, try out all possible plans and theories and make such applications of principals to actual conditions that will prove whether or not the dairy farmer can put them into successful operation. Thus far they are fulfilling their mission well. But there is another duty falling upon the col - leges that they might well look into. It is their duty to summarize and simplify their finding in such a way that it can be taken up by the normal schools and other like organizations to be passed by them to the farming population in every school district in the state. The colleges hold the same relation to the teaching of dairy husbandry that the centralized creameries do to buttermaking. It it their work to assemble the raw material, grade it out and work it over into the best finished product that can be made. The normal schools primarily correspond to the retail distributing agencies. The ground that some college men hold that only those who are spe - cialists in some definite line of agriculture are qualified to teach that particular line in normal schools and other secondary Insti - tutions is untenable. Would they say that only experienced butter - makers were qualified to carry on a retail trade in the sale of but - ter? Every manufacturing concern of business propositions has its salesmen — real live men — to introduce their goods to their patron- age. They don't insist that every salesman must know all the de - tails of assembling the raw material and putting it into a finished product. They get the essential features and then go after busi - ness. Just as clearly defined as are the duties of agricultural col - leges so is the field of the normal schools equally clear. We have in Nebraska nearly three hundred eighty thousand children of school age of which perhaps ninety per cent are. tributary to the country. Nearly seven thousand teachers are employed in instructing those children. It is a physical impossbility for those ■even thousand teachers who must qualify themselves to teach read- Ing, geography, arithmetic, etc., to make an exceptfon of agriculture and go to some agricultural college or school to get their training In that line. Moreover, I don't believe it is desirable to have it so if they could. Their training in agriculture should be given under corresponding conditions with their other schooling, in order that they may appreciate its relative value. I believe that such a course for dairying as is presented in the Normal School at Warrensburg, Missouri, is the nearest approach to what we need of any that I have been able to learn about. They have enough farm land to enable them to maintain a herd of their own which in itself is not only a source of profit but affords the opportunity to teach the essential features of the dairy business. The elements of these agricultural subject* must be taught to these </seg>

The president called the association to order and announced that according to the program the first thing would be an address by Dean E. A. Burnett of the State University. I am quite sure we win all be interested in hearing what he has to say to us. It is very important at this time that we keep in close touch with the Univer - sity as we have many things in the future in which this association and other similar and allied associations are expecting to realize benefits from the University and the University Farm. I, therefore, take great pleasure in introducing to you at this time Dean E A. Burnett of the University. ADDRESS OF DEAN E. A. BURNETT. K(Xote — This i« a stenographic report of Dean Burnett's address tunately sent to the printer without being ed'ted either by Dean ett or the secretary. ) Mr. President and Members of the Association. II am not really a professional dairyman although I am inter - 1 in every movement that is made for the building up of the &gt;• industry in this state. I have noticed for many years that association has been meeting here with the University, that association haa been one of the strong factors in building up dairy industry of the state. In these days it is only by organization that we are able to build up any industry. We have got past and beyond the time when one man working alone can do as well in any line of business as a group of men working together. The larger that group of men working together in connection with a single industry, the better the work of that industry is performed and the better it is for each man connected with It. So it has occured to me in looking over this state since I have been here, and in regard to the development of the dairy indr that it would become more and more necessary under the conditions that we are farming at the present time to get back to the cow and to make that cow most profitable that we can make her, because regard - lass of the fact that dairying on the product of cows on cheap land, intense industry of the dairy business is becoming more and more necessary on high-priced land. We are drifting into these high - priced lands and we must make these lands pay a large dividend per </seg>
            <seg id="p040">TWENTY-SEVENTH A.NNTAL CONVENTION" 39 K; then, too, naturally the farming industry should be suc'.i a small number of acres will make a profitable business for man who lives upon the land. The dairy industry rightly con - ed does not require a section or a half section of land to make ey. tTo own and operate a quarter-section farm of good land re - s an immense amount of capital at $100 or $150 per acre: the average young man is unable to enter into a business h requires such a capital as that. But when we consider the that forty or eighty acres of land operated as a dairy farm r the best modern methods will keep a good dairy herd, probably as many cattle as one man can handle and upon eighty acre* as many cattle as two men can handle, growing all the rough feed and a portion of the grain. Then you see it is possible with an In - dustry like the dairy industry to deliver a good business on a muca smaller capital than can be done by the average method of farming, because we will agree that forty acres of land or eighty acres of land is not enough for a man to make a good living upon growing corn, wheat and alfalfa. It is not big enough to furnish him an income as large as he ought to have to support his family under com - fortable conditions but with* the dairy industry and with modern methods it is ample and the probability is that our farmers here suffer more from too many acres than from any other thing — too many acres and not enough system in their farming operations. What we want is more men upon small farms conducting a business which is not too intensive or confined to a single line but which Is conducted upon modern methods and which is sufficiently intensive to furnish a good revenue per acre and to furnish labor for the man and his family all the year round and possibly for an ad - ditional man. Two things are necessary in order that the dairy busi - ness may prosper and those two things spelled out are the cow and the man. Fortunately you can not just go out and pick up either by the carload. You have to breed both of them because a man is not necessarily a dairyman simply because he milks cows and a cow is not necessarily a dairy animal because she gives milk. In order to hare a successful dairy business you must have a man who is edu - cated to the business, who knows the business and is willing to learn the business, and you must have the cow that can deliver the goods. It takes years of training to make the best of dairymen and it takes years of breeding and selection to develope the best cow. When you find a man who has behind him these years of training there is no trouble about his making money in the business; and there t» no trouble about his finding a place to work under profitable con - ditions if he wants to sell his services to some other man. When you find the cow that is capable of producing a large yield of milk or of butter, then she is worth more money to the dairyman than the average man believes. He doesn't expect to figure how much a good </seg>
            <seg id="p041">40 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION cow la worth in the dairy herd. I suppose as a matter of fact, most cow* which are being milked in our dairy herds are paying a proSt at this time under high prices for butter and cream. It would be a very poor cow, indeed, which would not pay her board, bat the fact that a cow when she is a poor cow or a medium cow would not act - ually produce a loss to the man who is keeping her is not suffcient excuse for keeping that cow in the herd when she can be replaced by a cow that would produce a large profit. And the man who is going to excell in his business must be an up-to-date man who Is working for the largest profit in the business when the investment and the labor involved is taken into consideration. If a dairy herd should be selected on a basis of its production, not of the average production of the herd but on the individual pro - duction of the individual cows which make up the herd and if we were told this and if we, as dairymen, would begin now, those who have not previously done so, and determine exactly the profit or at any rate the amount of butter or milk produced by each individual row in the herd, I think that would do more than any other thing which might be done to raise the average production of the herd and to increase the profits therefrom. The reason for that is plain enough to us because when you know the amount of money made or earned by each cow in the course of a year then you have some basis upon which to work in selecting cows that you want to retain in the herd; and if it should so happen, of course, that you are keeping cows at an actual loss, that is the greatest incentive in the world to get rid of the cows which are eating up the profits of other cows. II think nothing has been done in this state which would be I beneficial to the farmer than the work which has been done in tlas county of which you have certainly heard in years gone nd perhaps in this association, the work of individual co 1 t twenty or thirty herds in Douglas county. I think it was re - id last year, possibly with some little discussion here. I have the figures to indicate what those results show: i know in the place that the differences of values passed upon the different in that herd were different from the conception that the owners ?d upon them; and that the owners while they might have some of determining the value of the cow had no method so accurate as the method of determining by the scales and the Babcock test to show just how much butterfat each cow produced. What I would like to say to help the dairy industry along would be the extension of this movement so that every neighborhood might have a co-operative cow testing association of that sort. There are probably a few men who have heard that this is of great importance to high production of butter so that they will give the attention to that matter Individually but the cost of determining what a cow will actually produce is very much lessened if you have one man to conduct the test, say for twenty herds rather than operating and </seg>
            <seg id="p042">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 41 conducting the test on each Individual farm. But in the absence of a cow testing association where some man is especially detailed to conduct these tests, I believe every farmer should determine for himself the production of his individual cows. Immediately when you determine and begin to give attention to the production of these cows you will not limit that attention to the making of a record but jou will immediately give attention to the things which are neces - sary in order to improve the record. There are many cows in the herds of dairymen or so-called dairymen, capable of producing a good profit every year which do not make a profit because they don't have the care. You will find as you begin to give your cows good care and plenty of feed that their records will begin to separate fur - ther and further apart. That some cows do not respond to good feed and good treatment like other cows, and while they may have been pretty fairly well up when they were not given any special atten - tion the cow which has the additional capacity immediately responds to that extra feed and care, and what you feed her in the morning comes back to you at night so that you don't have any long term invest - ment. If any man is to make a profit in dairying he must get a high average production. I understand that roughly the average production per cow in this state Is 125 lbs. of butter. I haven't any doubt but what the average can be increased in its production at least 25 per cent by good feeding without any culling of the cows whatever. But there is no reason at all why any farmer under good methods could not produce 250 pounds per cow of butter per year, cer - tainly after he has had one year in which to test these cows out and to study and practice the question of feeding a little so that he will feed enough of proper feed and feed a reasonable balanced ration to his cows. Two hundred and fifty pounds of butter is not a big yield for any man's cows. Two hundred and fifty pounds can be easily reached by any dairyman after two years of selection and good care. He will not find it the first year probably. A man cannot sell all the cows he would not care to keep the first year but after two years of good selection and care any herd can and should be brought up to the 250-lb. mark. When a man has reached the 250-lb. mark he should not by any means be satisfied with that average. That is only an incentive which will induce him to try and get larger averages. The dairy cow should be looked upon by the farmer as a 'na - chine. How many of you have ever thought of a cow as being a ma - chine? She manufactures these products that you grow on the farm into condensed and profitable product. She is valuable just in de - gree or proportion as she is able to take and to manage these feeds — alfalfa, hay and corn and the other feeds you have such as silage and manufacture them into the finest product, and if you should keep her for dairy purposes and she wouldn't respond in milk and butter then you have a cow that you are keeping simply for other purposes and Dot for profit. All of you agree that when you have </seg>
            <seg id="p043">42 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION a binder or mower you want It to do tbe work for which it is made. Moat of you have a four-foot mower. You would buy a six-foot and some of you would buy an eight-foot mower. What do you do that for? You do it to increase the capacity of the machine so that it will do more work. Now, you should select a dairy cow for exactly the same purpose. When you have cows that are capable of pro - ducing milk and butter then it would be the most foolish thing in the world to work those cows for any other purpose than for butter. You know what happens to the laboring man if he is laid off every other week. In that event his income runs down. If a man works six months and then is idle the other six months, the six months of idle - ness consumes all the profit of his six months work and so it is ap - plicable to the dairy cow. As a machine she should work up to her full capacity and her capacity can only be determined when you fur - nish her an abundance of feed of the right kind and proper care. I think this perhaps might be illustrated in another way. Suppose for example that you have forty cows producing 150 pounds of butter per cow and that you could, by proper selection weed out twenty of these cows and have twenty cows left which would produce 300 pounds of butter per cow or by proper feeding and selection you could after two or three years produce as much butterfat from twenty cows as you originally produced from forty cows. Is not there more profit in the business by doing that, have you not cut down your labor, have you not cut down the feed, have you not cut down all those things which eat up the profits of the busi - ness? Yes, and so I think the most of us agree. They way to make money out of the dairy business is to get as many profitable cow machines as we can get and then not only work them day times but work them nights as well, for while they are laying idle, one of the things absolutely necessary is to work a cow up to her full capacity, and this you can do by feeding a balanced ration and that is easy in this state. It is very much easier in this state than in the states further east with which our butter comes in competition. We cannot ship our alfalfa hay from here to New York and the New England states without paying from 25 to 40 per cent of the price at the other end of the railroad but you can send butter to the New York market in competition with the butter made there by paying a very small percentage of the price of the finished product to UM railroads. So that we feel that while we are in competition with New York and the New England states in matters of butter pro - duction the difference in the freight rate ts only a fraction of a cent a pound, while the difference in the price of feed is very great. They may pay double, and do pay in many instances, as much money for their feed as we pay here. If alfalfa hay is worth $25 per ton In Illinois and as much as or more than that for feed in New York, it would seem to me that when it is worth $10, $12 and $15 per ton here in Nebraska, if we </seg>
            <seg id="p044">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 43 bad as good cow machines as they have to make the butter with and if we had as much brains to put into the business that we can make mora profits than they can. It seems to me now that there is no place where more profit can be made in the dairy industry than can be made right here. Not only must we have a balanced ration, which I say is easily gotten in this state out of our corn and alfalfa and perhaps some of our other grains, but the time has come when we must have grass all the year round. That is not a surprising statement. That time has come when we must have grass all the year round and we can have grass all the year round or we can have its equivalent without any trouble whatever. What does grass do for your cows? You know when you turn out your cows in the spring on grass that they go up in their milk produc - tion. What is it that makes that increase in the production? It in the succulent feed, easily digested feed. If we can have grass nil the year round why not have it, and we can have it by means of a silo. No man in this day and age would have any right to call himself a dairyman in the modern sense of the word unless he uses a silo because we have ample proof that silage not only increases the yield per cow but it decreases the cost of production per pound. I cannot give you the actual figures here but I think In the state - ments I make regarding silage I am a little conservative. I think our experiments in this institution has shown that we cut the cost of production of butter at least 20 per cent by use of silage, at least 20 per cent. If a banker knew how to increase the profits on his business or to cut off his expenses 20 per cent, he would not be long in doing it, would he? If a merchant down on O street in Lincoln knew how to reduce the cost of his operating expenses at least 20 per cent without decreasing the value of his business, he would not be long in doing it. In fact, he would not sleep until he had begun opera - tions so to do. I think the only question would be just how far he could reduce the cost of production without injuring the volume of his business. Now, when we can at the same time cut down the cost per pound and increase the volume of business we all agree that whatever is necessary in order to be up-to-date dairymen we should do. We have been inclined to think, some of us who are rather new in the business, that silage could only compete with grass in the winter ttime. A dairyman who has been here at our meet - ings often, being a large farmer in Illinois and a good business man, said to me in Chicago at the Fat Stock Show: "During last summer's drought I took my dairy herd off the pasture. I did not send them out to the pasture. There was not anything there for them to eat. I put them in the yard and fed them silage all through that drought of late July, August and September." He said that his dairy herd did not shrink at all, did not shrink perceptibly on account of the drought and that his milk and butter production </seg>
            <seg id="p045">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 44 i right up and profits did not shrink. Now, what happened to dairyman who had to depend on grass under such conditions, cows did not get any feed in the pastures, the pastures were and poor feed, and he had to supplement with a little grain to i up the production, if he did keep it up, and it cost him verv h more to keep up the production on grain than it does to keep &gt; on good green pasture or succulent feed from the silo. So that e are going to be up-to-date in the business we must have suc - at feed all the year round and so we will come to depend upon silo in summer as well as in the winter. It may mean that we have two silos but if they pay a profit on the investment that 1 that the business man could ask. There is no line of business that I am familiar with which pays quicker returns or more regular dividends than this business. Sup - pose a man starts out to feed a bunch of cattle, puts them In the feed lot in November, perhaps in October, and then feeds them three, four or five months, maybe six months and all this time he ha* not got a dollar of return until he is ready to put them on the market in a finished condition. But that is not true of the dairyman. He muat have his working capital that is true, but his profits pay him a dividend every day in the year. I imagine he gets his cream check every week in the year. The dairyman should know whether profits show that it is paying him. what it costs to buy grain and feed. You can tell at the end of the week whether the corn you feed at 50c or 60c per bushel is paying back as much money aa It costs you. That is one point, it seems to me, which is of some importance in connection with this business of establishing and building up a home industry. I do not know of any section of the country where dairying is carried on as a business that people are not well - to-do, the most of them what we call rich, what the farmer would call rich and well-to-do, a man who has money enough so that he don't have to think whether he can take care of himself for this year or next — a man who If he wants a little vacation has at least got money enough so that he can afford it. In every section of the world that I know of where dairying is practiced as a business, land ir high priced and it is higher priced than it was before the dairy industry was devolep and so far as I know there Is no line of In - dustry outside of some very high-elafsed specialists like fruit grow - ing, etc., that will develop the price of land more than the dairy ln- t There is another point and there is a good reason for it, that only does the farm produce a good revenue but it grows richer after year and that is a thing which cannot be said of any r line of farming. I have given some attention in years gone not recently, to the sandy lands of the state of Wisconsin, s which are not rich nor well adapted to general lines of farm- </seg>
            <seg id="p046">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL. CONVENTION 45 tand I notice that where the dairy industry has been developed lat section those farms grew rich and they are worth two or e times as much per acre as they were before the dairy in - ry was started; and the farms upon which dairying is practiced worth a great deal more per acre than the farms where dairy - has not been practiced, simply because more fertility has been d to the land from year to year until a large production was on the land. There is one other thing I would like to discuss, in a sort of per - sonal way. In some communities in some of the older states they have attempted to organize their business into a sort of community industry where normally everybody in that community would take hold of the same line of business. For example, I am told that in certain sections of Ohio you can find a dozen breeders of Aberdeen Angus cattle within a radius of twenty miles, that you can find in certain sections of the state a dozen breeders, more or less, of Jer - seys and another section of Holsteins. And the same thing wouli be true of other breeds of dairy cattle — that you find a large number of men who specialize in that business and who have good dairy herds, and that as a result of this- community of interests in the industry they have in the first place, built up much more profitable lines of business and they have better herds than they would have had if there was only the one man in the neighborhood who was in the dairy business. They have better bred herds. They pay more money for sires if necessary, which have good records behind them, and good pedigree points, a pedigree which shows a generation of good production behind them. In the second place, having the cattle there for use and sale they attract the men who want to buy these things that they have to sell not only the butter but the live stock. You will notice that whenever a man wants to buy a high class animal he is almost certain to be attracted to some neighborhood where more than one animal of that class can be found; and everyone of you would go very much quicker to a neighborhood where you could find twenty herds of dairy cattle, if you wanted to buy a dairy cow, than you would to a section of country where they only had one or two, because if one man didn't have what you wanted you could see other herds with very little expense. So that these people have built up several community enterprises. I think Nebraska is at the point just now where we ought to have more than one section of the country and more than one man in each section engaged in the same line of business; and we ought as a state to try to get a number of men to go into the dairy business, into a sort of com - munity with each other and form an organization and breed the same kind of cattle. If necessary they can unite with each other in buying high class sires if they cost more money than one man can afford to pay and in that way build up their herd. I think you will find that when you have established a community of that sort, </seg>
            <seg id="p047">46 dairy Interest, that the industry would prosper more than it bad ever prospered before. It would also immediately attract men to your neighborhood wherever it was who were purchasers of such cattle as you had to sell, men whom you would never have seen at all if it were not for the fact that you had built up a reputation of rood herd. I listened yesterday to Mr. Howard of Pawnee City, a horse buyer, telling about the feeding or* horses over there in the other building. He told about hi* methods and about buying a horse for $140, one particular horse, which he kept in the feeding lots for three or four months and then sold him for (375. The man who bought him took him to St. Louis and sold him for 1500. The nan who bought him in St. Louis sent him on to Baltimore and there sold him for $900. That is only an instance — it has this to do with the business. Why was Mr. Howard able to get more for that horse than any other man in his neighborhood? Because he gathered together a large number of horses of a definite class that somebody wanted and buyers of horses came from St. Louis, Chicago and New York whenever he announced or advertised that he had one hundred or two hundred horses ready for the market, and looked the horses over. They would not have come to look at one horse or perhaps a half dozen horses, but they would come if they could see one hundred or two hundred horses. Just so it is in the dairy business. If you will put ten good herds of Jersey cattle into one county or ten good herds of Holstein cattle into one county yon will find ten times as many men coming to look your cattle over as you would if you only had one herd and if men come they are of the class who are willing to pay high prices for good animals. Sup - pose you breed Jersey cattle and have a Jersey bull for sale and yon are the only man in that neighborhood or county, nobody knows you have him except your immediate neighbors for perhaps five miles around. How much is that bull worth? I don't care if his dam made 600 pounds of butter a year, how much is he worth? He is worth just as much as this man over here thinks he is worth to him, $25 or $50. You let people know that you have an animal of that sort for sale and It becomes widely known it might attract every man in the state of Nebraska and if so you will find that there is some man who will think he is worth $inn or *l"0. TVhv* Be - cause he has a larger use for him. You let it be known throughout your dairy district that you have a high classed animal for sale, the best there is in that district, some man will want him and will think he Is worth $300 or $400 to him. I only mention this as an illus - tration to show that if we are going to be up-to-date men and pro - duce goods that are equal to any in the state or United States, we most have some method by which we can let the people know that we have the goods. If you will remember that and let people know yon have the goods the only trouble you will have will be in not </seg>

It will not be a trouble of disposing of the animals which have real merit. II think I have spoken to you as much or as long as I ought to sh that something might be done by which we can get a eo - ative cow testing association established in every county in this ). You can't do it all in one year. You might be able to do 1 five but if we get the movement started and on foot and it ed that this was a profitable thing to do it would gradually ad throughout the state and it would be a profitable thing for business. It aeems to me, men of the convention, that we ought to be wide enough awake to appreciate the fact that this is one of the things which is essential to profits in our bbusiness and if it Is a profitable movement which would make profits for our business we ought to push it and take up with it. The other things which I would like to see done in our state, and I think they will gradually come, is to get groups of men, half a dozen or more in the neigh - borhood to say that we will all go into the same breeding of cattle or of dairy cattle; that we will all breed Jerseys in this neighbor - hood and in this neighborhood Holstelns and in this neighborhood Guernseys; we will call a sort of class organization. If anyone learns of anything that the others have not heard of or will be of benefit we will communicate to each other and we will all put in operation the very best dairy methods in the neighborhood and build up dairy herds which will draw men from other parts of the country who want to buy dairy cattle. If such a thing could be started in this state it will be of large profit to those men who go into that organization and who take hold of the work and push it. (Applause.) The President: I consider we are fortunate in having Dean Burnett speak to us at this time. I regret that he cannot stay with us another hour. While we have him here if there are any questions anyone wishes to ask it would be a good time to ask them now, but if there are no questions we will pass to the next number. Mr. J. R Van Buskirk is in the audience and I shall call on him for a few I Mr. Van Buskirk: Mr. President and Gentlemen: It is always a : pleasure to me as well as to you to meet Dean Burnett and hear speak. I have been hearing him for a number of years He over in Colorado Springs awhile ago and he had them listening &gt; with both ears. He struck the key note over there and he struck the key note here, of better cows, fewer of them and r trained men. He spoke of training and educating the man takes care of the cows and the same way with educating and ling the cow. In a few words I will follow out what I shall to say along the line of consolidated schools. It was my </seg>
            <seg id="p049">48 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION tsure to say something about rural schools the other day and I pleased to come here and speak upon the subject. I have come idieve somewhat in telepathy. There is certainly something in consolidated rural school idea. It is the same thing in or - red agriculture as in a great many other subjects. People k of the same things about the same time. tl rather believe this dairy association has got more money or members can raise more money, as an association, than most of the associations which are meeting hrre. I believe that 40c it is pretty good stuff and you can get more of it if you try. us follow out the lines suggested by Dean Burnett. He wants isive agriculture and he wants a few men to agree to go in :her and do the same thing. You know it is very hard to take a man or a bunch of men who are grown up, as some of us are here and some who are not here — it is very hard to change our ways of doing; so suppose we commence with the rising generation or those of younger age. Suppose this Dairyman's' Association and the Creamery companies which I believe, together, have plenty of money, go to work together and find some townships in the different counties of the state which will be willing to co-operate with them and get a consolidated school in the center of the township. The Dean tells you how necessary it is to train people to take care of cows. Now, suppose you have a consolidated school near the center of a township together with some seventy-five or eighty acres of land on which is kept an excellent herd of, say twenty Jerseys, Hol - tteins or Guernseys — it matters not so that they are good cows. And then have one room in the school house or a hall where chil - dren can be taken back and forth, to be instructed in dairy prin - ciples. It has been done this way for a long while in other places. There is a township in Northern Indiana where it is practiced and they take school children there and teach them the principles of the dairy business. There they see In operation the cows and the man - ner of feeding, the manner of milking and taking care of the milk. and all those things that relates to the business. Now, how long would it be if such an institution or a school was established before those children would go home and take their instruction to their parents in the different homes and different parts of the township? How long would it be before the parents would begin to - sit up and take notice? In speaking upon this subject on Monday with the Dean Bur - nett at another meeting of this character it was there said that Dean Burnett and others have considered it very important to get a con - solidated school like this established. I believe it would pay the members of this association to even run in debt, if the legislature would not create a fnnd for this purpose. By so doing they conld raise twenty-live thousand dollars and get some township school to co-operate and start one of these consolidated rural schools. You </seg>
            <seg id="p050">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL, CONVENTION 49 would also be Improving the dairy methods in general. It seems to me that it is entirely practical. I notice the railroads, whenever they want anything new along the line of operating their roads, es - tablish a school. How long would it be if such a farm as I have mentioned could be started within thirty or forty miles of Lincoln near the center of the township — how long would it be before it would be full of pupils? How long would it be before some other township in some other county would say: "Of course now, why those people over there are making money, they are going right along with their school and it is a first class proposition." There you see is your additional demonstration business at once. It is not necessary for me to speak of the necessity of demon - stration. As I have said the railroads, practically all of them in the South, have established on their lines of roads demonstration farms and whenever any experienced help is needed they send a man to do that work. The great thing is to educate the dairymen or the farmer how to best conduct his work and by use of experimental and demonstration schools this knowledge can best be disseminated. It Is the practical demonstration that counts. It seems to me Mr. President, and gentlemen of the convention that this dairymen's association might get busy along this line. As I said before, it occurs to me that you have more money than other associations which are meeting here. My people are not getting cream enough and if the the farmer can produce more cream he can receive more money and I know it is a good proposition to get busy on this township propo - sition and go in together and establish consolidated rural schools. I firmly believe it will give larger returns and in a little while it would give back $20 to $40 for $1 spent. If these consolidated township schools could be established Nebraska would get back a good deal more than $20 in return for $1 spent. Gentlemen, I thank you. (Applause.) tThe President: If there are no questions to be asked Mr. Van irk we will pass on to the next number. As we all know our late , Dairy and Drug Commissioner, Mr. Jackson, has recently de - id this life, it has therefore fallen to others to take up his work, have prevailed upon Mr. E. L. Redfern, Commission Chemist, probably has more to do with the details and actual work of commission than anyone else in the state, to come and make us port on the work of the commission for the past year and it is my pleasure to Introduce to you Mr. Redfern. I Mr. Redfern: Mr. President and Gentlemen: I regret that I i to take the place of a man who has so soon after his appoint - t departed this life and gone to his reward. However, in natural it seems these things will happen. I have a few thoughts here :h will give you some Idea of what the commission is trying to do the dairy industry of the state. During my seven years connection with the Nebraska Dairy </seg>
            <seg id="p051">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 50 Commission, I have seen it grow from an office force of two working under a law which only gave the commission power to require milk to have 3 per cent of butter fat and cream 18 per cent of butter fat. and forbidding the use of preservatives, (all inspection work and collection of samples being done by the commissioner or chemist), to a force of eleven persons during nine months of the year and a force of fifteen persons during the other three months. The legislature of 1907 gave us the present law and the last legislature strengthened the law in some particulars. It must be remembered that the law places under the super - vision of this commission other work besides that of improving and encouraging the dairy industry in Nebraska. We must inspect all articles of food, and their name is legion, to see that they are prop - erly branded and free from adulteration., All patent medicines such as "cure-alls" and headache mixtures must be inspected as well as all pharmacopoeial preparations. Then there are the paints and oils. Also all places where foods are handled, manufactured, kept or offered for sale must be inspected for sanitary conditions and health of employees. All stock foods, concentrated and condimental and finally agricultural seeds. I merely give you these facts so that you will not be too critical if you think the commission is not doing all it should for #ie dairy industry. tWith the exception of an isolated case now and then the sale of med or watered milk has become a thing of the past and dairy - are furnishing to the retail trade milk and cream up to standard itter fat. tThe sale of milk containing injurious preservatives, such as for - ehyde, has become a thing of the past. I believe the commission taught the milk producer that milk produced under proper sani - conditions and properly handled will keep sweet a sufficient :h of time and does not need a preservative. The use of pre - itives in any food products encourages careless and unsanitary tods and it is well that our laws have put them under the ban. The fact that our capital city has the largest creamery in the world and that our metropolis manufactures more butter than any other city in the world Justifies us in placing Nebraska among the principal dairy states of the country. I With these facts before us the dairy commission has been car - % on an educational work through circulars and its dairy inspec - . The inspectors have visited many dairies and given instruc - ■ on the care and handling of milk and cream and the care of separator to insure its being always clean. A great many orders ! been served requiring changes and improvements in the dairy is and milk houses so as to make them fit places for producing ; of the highest quality. In some cases the inspectors have had low their badges to keep from engaging in a fistic bout but I am to say that their Instructions are as a rule kindly received and </seg>
            <seg id="p052">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNLAL CONVENTION 51 obeyed. We are at the present time conducting sediment testa of milk furnished to the retail trade and the creameries. This work ha* been done In six or seven of the larger towns of the state and before this investigation is completed every town of any site will have a record of its milk supply in the office of the commission. In each case where we find a dairyman selling milk containing an un - reasonable amount of dirt he is given warning that the second of - fense may result In prosecution and we are receiving many replies showing a readiness to comply with any suggestions which the de - partment wishes to offer. This work is not being done with the hope of prosecution hut as a means of educating the dairymen how to properly produce and care for his product. An example of careless methods is shown in a recent occurrence when an inspector opened the separator of a milk producer and scraped from the inside of the bowl long strings of stale milk; the milk cans were also found to have similar accumulations around the Inside rim. The milk from this place was also found to contain the largest amount of dirt so far found In our investigation. A new educational feature which the department has under - taken this winter is having two of our dairy Inspectors enter the farmers' Institute work. These inspectors are graduates of our state school and well qualified to give lectures on" dairy subjects. They are lecturing before hundreds of farmers every week on how to build and equip sanitary dairy barns; how to draw the milk and properly care for It afterwards, also how to weed out the unprofitable cow. All these talks are Illustrated with suitable charts, and the reports we have received have been exceedingly gratifying. It is possible in this way to reach hundreds of people which we could not do other - wise. K During the past year the dairy inspectors have visited approxi - ly seven hundred towns of the state, a thorough inspection of and cream being made in each case. I had the pleasure last August of listening to a paper on the "milk problem" by Dr. Rawl, Chief of the dairy division of the U. S. department of agriculture, and It was such a good paper that I wll quote from it in part. "Milk Is the most difficult food that we have to control and is important from the food commissioner's standpoint because it is easy to adulterate and the adulteration is hard to detect. It is important from the health officer's standpoint because it may carry filth and disease. There Is need for more attention to milk than to any other single foodstuff on the American market. Its sat - irfactory control requires not only good laws well enforced, but a great educational campaign as well, because milk can never be con - trolled until consumers contribute their due support to that control. Milk control is Inseparably connected with milk production. It is a deplorable fact that oftentimes the dairy Inspector is ineapable of performing the duties of his position. This is often due to politics </seg>
            <seg id="p053">52 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION I for auch conditions there is no relief except by the public, for so as it 1b willing that a department charged with such Important es shall be so misused, Just so long must it pay the penalty. But iclent inspection is not due to this cause alone. The appointive ers often do not themselves recognize what qualifications are ssary for this work. Without qualified inspectors, dairy farm ection amounts to naught. Suppose building Inspectors knew ing about building constructon, or engine inspectors knew noth - about engines, what would all this inspection amount to? Like - the lnspecton of dairy farms by men who know nothing about 1 amounts to nothing. The dairy farmer must be taught, then if he won't be taught he must be prosecuted. Inspectors do not require a thorough scientific knowledge of milk or of sanitation; one thoroughly trained man on the force as a chief inspector can, in a short while, give them all of the trainng that they need on these two subjects, but they must have practical knowledge of the fundamentals of economic milk produc - tion; first, because by this means more than by any other are they able to get the farmers' confidence; and second, the giving of assist - ance of this kind helps to keep down the cost of good milk which Is directly In the interest of the consumers, who the inspectors repre - sent. Milk producers may be divided into two general groups. First, those who produce good milk; and second those who produce bad or unsafe milk. This latter group may be divided into two classes. Those who are dishonest and are not willing to recognize that they have a right to produce milk only when they comply with the Jaw and supply an article that is safe for consumption. Second, those "who are honest, are not wilfull law breakers, and would not intentionally do anyone injury, but who are probably prejudiced and ignorant of the dangers that may accompany milk, and who think that most modern requirements of dairy officials is nonsense. For the first class the only remedy is the strong arm of the law; the second class contains the majority of the average milk producers. The fun - damental problem is how are we going to get the average dairyman to produce good milk that can be used In safety. It cannot be done by force but must be done largely by education and the inspector should be the educator." A large part of the Inspectors' work is in the cream receiving stations of which there are over two thousand in the state. These stations must be kept in a sanitary condition and free from any contaminating odors of vegetables, poultry or oils. The operators are instructed how to care for the cream, to keep it in the best pos - sible condition pending shipment to the factory. The glass-ware mast also be kept clean and the scales and weights in perfect condition. It is a difficult task to teach the average operator that a cream scale Is a delicate machine for he Is Inclined to treat it much the same as a platform scale. </seg>
            <seg id="p054">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNl'AL CONVENTION 53 To obtain accurate results in testing requires a delicate balance and great care in weighing the cream, a drop or two of cream either way making a test vary considerable from the true test. While the law forbids the manipulation of a cream test we have found It a difficult matter to successfully prosecute violations of this kind. Even though the department is certain that an operator has manip - ulated a test it is next to impossible to prove it In court as the law says, "wilfully" manipulate and this point offers a loophole for es - cape. The fine for this offense was raised from $10 to $50 by the last legislature: this takes cases from the justice and county courts and places them in the district court with a Jury trial. This Is not only unnecessary but expensive and impedes the work of the depart - ment. A $10 fine is sufficient for such offenses and will have the same wholesome effect. The next legislature should be asked to re - duce this fine for the good of the department. The word "wilfull" should also be eliminated and the department given the power to revoke licenses of testers when the evidence shows them to be on - worthy or incompetent. tThe last legislature gave the department power to make rules regulations. A rule was made last summer forbidding the pay - ; for cream on the day of delivery in order to give the operator ! time to make his cream tests, thus insuring greater accuracy Is testing. This ruling was gladly accepted by many but some led to obey and in two or three cases that were prosecuted the ts decided against us and to test file matter we have carried one to the supreme court for a final decision. If we can get a -able decision on this it will make future action along this line laratively easy. The quality of the cream produced in Nebraska is not number one and the department has been doing considerable work along this line but there is a vast amount of work yet to be done. This I con - sider one of the most important tasks of the department and it can only be accomplished by going to the source of production and edu - cating the producer how to properly handle his cream from the time it comes from the separator until it is delivered to the station or the common carrier. I believe the work the dairy inspectors are doing this winter in the farmer's Institutes is a step in the work of teach - ing the Nebraska dairyman how to produce cream of No. 1 quality. It is impossible to make number one butter from No. 2 cream and Nebraska butter will not command the highest price on the market until we can raise the quality of the cream from which it is made. I While Nebraska has made rapid advancement in the develoi&gt; - lt of the dairy industry there is still greater possibilities in her eloped and undeveloped resources. With the employment of ctical and scientific methods the dairymen of Nebraska can attain enviable position among his fellow farmers. It does not require ist amount of money to properly equip a dairy farm. One of the </seg>
            <seg id="p055">54 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Iectors report* that he found in the course of his inspections a &gt;• barn that was among the best he had seen. It held twenty - n cows and only cost $300. Expensive equipment is not neces - to the production of sanitary milk and cream. If you will ce at the government dairy score card you will find that the total • for equipment is 40 while for methods it is 60. We have found s where the equipment of the dairy was elaborate and expensive the methods were lacking with the result that we were compelled core it down. tThe weeding out of the unprofitable cow requires a little more but the dairyman who does it is well repaid for hie extra ef- The improvement of the quality can only be done by a thor - knowledge of the methods of production, the care of the pro - after it is produced and a willingness to put these methods into tThe commission is trying to place these facts before the farmers le state in hopes that more of them will enter the dairy industry that those who are now in the business will increase their dairy i and develop them along modern scientifific methods. I believe something should be done to raise the efficiency of the station operator, for under our present system he may be able to answer the examination questions satisfactorily and pay the $1 license fee, but after this has been done we often find out that he is a care - less, indifferent, individual and wholly disqualified personally to be the medium between the cream producer and the factory. In South Dakota the cream operator must pass a hard examination both oral and written and also make a series of cream tests under varying con - ditions in the presence ot a representative of the commission and pay one license of $5. I am told that this has given them operators far above the average. I am not ready to say what we should do in Nebraska but the matter is one that demands much serious thought as our present system should be improved for the best interests of the dairy Industry. ■ The President: On behalf of the association I wish to thank Redfern for so full and complete a report. II notice in the audience the newly appointed Food, Dairy and ; Commissioner, Mr. Hansen, and I think it would be a very nice [ if we could have Mr. Hansen say a few words to us at this time, ow whatever he may have to say will be of interest to each one i and, therefore, I have pleasure in introducing to you our pres - dairy commissioner, Mr. Hansen. EiJr. Hansen: Mr. President and Members of the Dairymen's lation: You probably realize from the tone of my voice that I ot in very good condition to speak to you at length The fact is I am now in a new business and have not yet had time to igate very thoroughly and at this particular time I could not ery much about the work of the commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">55 tl am pleased to be here and meet the members of the mtwla- I wish to say that every effort on the part of the commission be done to promote the interests of dairying in the state of Ne - ca. I came out here this afternoon to listen to what others t have to say and I am happy to state that 1 am not disappointed, ird a very able lecture by Dean Barnett and his remarks certainly ;s education to you that you will all appreciate and no doubt home with you and I would ask you seriously to avail yourselves 1 the good things that he said because they all point to success. I was born in a country and reared therein a portion of my youthful days, where dairy interests were really the visible means cf success. Many years ago, thirty-fiflve or forty, that country was confronted with the prospect of not being able to raise enough from their farms to pay their taxes and to maintain themselves, and they saw that something must be done as it was necessary to do some - thing for the farmers that they might prosper. So they conceived the idea that dairying would be a successful remedy and they proceeded immediately to educate the people along the lines of dairying the same as they are attempting to educate the people here. What has done history records, and today Denmark has splendid dairy inter - ests and is a prosperous and happy nation. It would have been im - possible for them to be so had it not been for the dairy interests. At has been pointed out to you today the man and the cow and the means by which you attain results, is so practically well illustrated in that country and no doubt it would pay you to investigate what has been done there. They have the cows and they have attained the means and best methods of feeding and the best methods of produc - tion. It is a little country of about 15,000 square miles with five and a half million people, principally farmers. The great state of Nebraska has 76,000 square miles and a soil richer in the minerals required for the purpose of producing the food products or the feed for the dairy cow. If you will compute the size of the two countries against each other and if you compute the resources of the dairy in - terests of that country against this state you will readily realize the wonderful richness and possibilities of oar state. There is a won - derful field before you with ample implements to transact farming successfully. After listening to the address of Dean Burnett of the agricultural college of the State of Nebraska you ought to congratu - late yourselves that you are here. tl wish to say as commissioner of the dairy Interests of the State ebraska that I shall endeavor to strictly enforce the law and to that it is obeyed in every way so that we shall maintain our tation for prosperity and progress. I shall endeavor in an hon - le and business way to see to it that the laws of our state in re - n to the inspection of milk and cream and the sale thereof upon basis of quality shall be properly enforced and that the interests 1 men connected with the selling of same or in any way shall be </seg>
            <seg id="p057">56 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION protected, and that he who renders the best service shall certainly receive the best pay. This will give an enthusiasm to the better equipment and a better preparation for each one. tl regret, gentlemen, that I am not in a condition to speak to and of not being able to speak to you along lines that might be lore interest, and this is owing in part to the short time that I : been given charge of this department. I wish to repeat with ranee that I shall use every effort to give you the best service in work that has been entrusted to my care. And so in conclusion sure you that I am delighted to meet you and hope it will be my lure to meet you often in this work. I thank you. (Applause.) KThe President: I also notice in the audience one of our former ' commissioners, Mr. S. L. Maains, and I would like to call on him i few remarks as I know you will be pleased, as well as myself, ;ar what he may have to say. Mr. Mains: * Mr. President, Gentlemen and Ladies: I can't un - derstand why the president has called on me because I am sure I have not anything of unusual interest at this time because I don't own any dollars that are invested in dairy stock nor in any silo busi - neaa or any other line of business connected with the work of this association. But T will say that I am much pleased to be here and have enjoyed myself very much attending these meetings. When I was commissioner I certainly took a great deal of interest in the work of the commission and also have even since I went out. It Is very interesting work looking after the dairy Interests of our state. When a person has been engaged in that work for a time he will naturally be Interested in the progress and success of the department. I am pleased that the last legislature passed a bin with appro - priation for the food commissioner's department and that it will now have an increased number of inspectors and I am glad the commission is progressing along this line. This new law will be an educator both to the dairymen and to the public. I hope you will see to it that its provisions are rigidly enforced. It is an eye opener to be shown the quality of the milk you have been drinking. I felt sure that when Mr. Jackson took charge of the office that the department would grow in efficiency and be a success and I am pleased to note that I have not been disappointed. I believe that under the administration of Commissioner Hansen the department of Food, Dairy and Com - sisalon is bound to grow because the commisson is bigger than one man. I believe that department will have a general growth. I am out of the office and never want to be in again but I do wish there was some wa-y of regulating the appointment of the commissioner so that when we would have a good man he would not be a political football. (Applause.) In connection with the annual report of the secretary and treasurer, Secretary Bassett took occasion to explain just what ap - propriations are made for the use of the dairymen's association. He </seg>
            <seg id="p058">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 57 said: "We have no money to go out and do some of the things sug - gested. We have barely money enough to hold our annual conven - tion and have the proceedings of the association published. The dairymen's association itself has no wealth. Whatever it has is in the hands of the people. The association is a sort of clearing house. We get ideas, bring them here and promulgate them and publish them throughout the state by means of our published annual reports and the holding of these meetings. There are two hundred fifty stu - dents here in the dairy school. That would mean that if every county in the state were represented there would be two and a frac - tion from each county. Kf you heard one of the papers read this morning, the one by Mr. Culver it illustrated to you what the dairy school or the school iculture is doing for our young people. I want to offer at this time a resolution that will cover some of the things presented by the remarks of Dean Burnett and Mr. Van Buskirk — two ideas which I think we can help to carry into effect. Tou know we have to do things in this association by committees. I be - lieve it can be said that out here in the Central West we can do things that cannot be done farther east. If you go back to the eastern states yon are likely to find a well settled principle of conducting things always along the same line — they seem more inclined to run in ruts and grooves. It is sometimes quite difficult to do some things in an original way. With us, there are no ruts. We are a go-ahead people inclined to do things our own way. Our association is, and always has been originative. I could mention many things that we have orginated and done as an association for the dairy interest, which hare, later been taken up by other associations. I will read the resolution — Resolved, That the president of this association appoint a com - mittee of three to report at the next annual meeting as to the best method of teaching dairying in consolidated rural schools and high schools; and also the best method of securing a considerable number of breeders of distinct breeds of dairy cattle in a locality or county. Mr. Bassett: Mr. President, I move the adoption of the resolu- Motlon seconded and carried Mr. President: I will name as the members of the committee, J. R. Van Buskirk. V. S. Culver and E. M. Little. The President: I have just learned that our Governor will be nnable to be with us this afternoon. It is possible he can give us his address at some time before our sessions close. He has been called out of the city and we will therefore pass to the next number. And in introducing the next speaker it hardly seems necessary to go into any ancient or extended introduction regarding Prof. Geo. L. McKay. He has addressed us may times heretofore. He probably Is at this time the best known authority on dairy and cream subjects </seg>
            <seg id="p059">58 In this country. Mr. McKay at the present time is secretary of the American Association of Creamery and Butter Manufacturers of Chi - cago.

Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Dairymen's Association: I would be pleased if my wife could hear all the good things that your president has said about me. She knows me from a dif - ferent standpoint. Your Chairman gave me the subject of "The Fu - ture of Nebraska" but I see on the program it reads "The Nebraska Dairymen's Future." THE FUTURE OF NEBRASKA. Prof. G. L. McKay. Mr. Chairman, Ladies, Gentlemen The subject assigned me "The Future of Nebraska" was, I presume, given me by the Chairman. It is always a difficult task to predict the future of anything, especially would it be difficult for me to predict the future of this great state. If certain lines or methods are followed, we can reasonably predict certain results. For instance, if I take a train from here to Omaha with the price of a ticket in my pocket, I can be reasonably sure that I will get there. Experience has taught me this. I do not know who coined the phrase "I am from Missouri — you have got to show me." There has never been a time when that phrase was more applicable than now. We are all more or less sceptical — we have to be shown. "Seeing la believing" with us. Some time ago, I met a colored professor by the name of Carver from the Tuskegee Institute. He was a graduate of the Iowa State College. In discussing their methods of teaching the colored students, he said they had to use very elementary methods, or where possible give visible demonstration. For instandfe, they spent about two weeks investigating a watermelon. First they studied the contents. On being asked what It contained the answer was "Seeds, fiber and lassus." Everything sweet Is "lassus." On being asked how they knew the melon contained seeds, they replied they had seen others cut open, so they could reasonably predict the contents of this one. After cutting the melon open and examining it, they weighed It on a finely adjusted pair of scales. On the following day they again weighed it, and to their astonishment found that it weighed lighter. This was a difficult problem for them to understand. The melon </seg>

The student in this way was made to understand the law of evaporation, or the manner in which moisture paweg off in the air. Now, we like the colored student can make, a reasonable prediction from things that we have seen. Exclusive grain farming, as practiced from New England west - ward to the Pacific in places, has left behind a trail of depleted soils, when carried on for too long a time, ruined farms and abandoned homes have marked the way. I The prosperity and happiness of any people depend on the devel - :nt and conservation of their agricultural resources. Therefore, future of Nebraska will depend to a very great extent on the od of farming pursued. Looking at this question from a broad standpoint, two prob - lems confront us and these same problems concern the people of all civilized countries. The first is the economical production of food products for the people. The second is the conservation of the toil for the benefit of future generations. In some correspondence I had with Gov. Hoard of Wisconsin some time ago, he stated that his definition of a farmer was a man that operated a farm in such a manner that he left it in a better con - dition than it was when he took rt. In other words, he added more fertility to the land than lie took from it. I think the Governor's definition was a good one, because the same can be accomplished. K Statistics are available showing that in some of the old European itries where farming has been carried on for many generations, land hag become more productive, or that the yield per acre of a has actually increased, while in this country the yield per acre minishing. tAs Prof. Mumford has said: "The fertility of the soil is not in - ustible — it is not self perpetuating. Soil fertility can be mineJ of the soil as coal can be mined out of the earth. When the lity of soil has decreased beyond a certain point, then the cost ultivation becomes too great, and farming becomes unprofitable we may have abandoned farms. This fact has been repeatedly onstrated in the history of ancient and modern agriculture. What is needed to maintain and Improve the fertility of the soil? The investigations on this matter are clear. There are four things needed under existing conditions to supply directly or indi - rectly to agricultural lands; vegetable matter or humus, phosphorus, nitrogen and potash." K Dairy farming seems to supply practically all the necessary tents needed for the conservation of the soil. Particularly is true in butter production, as the skim milk and the buttermilk fed to the animals, thus being returned to the farm. It has been uently said that the man who is producing butter Is selling prac- </seg>
            <seg id="p061">60 tically air, sunshine and rain, and this statement is founded on t Scientific investigation has shown time and again that a ton of •t, which has a market value of $600, or $650 at the present i removes less than 50c worth of fertilizing material from the Now while the production of butter tends more to build up conserve the fertility of the soil than any other line of agricul - pursuit, it is also more profitable. This is why dairying is ed on almost entirely on the high priced lands of Europe. A mistaken idea prevails in the minds of many people regarding the growth of legume crops, such as alfalfa and clover. Some imagine that all that is necessary to supply the soil with nitrogen Is to grow alfalfa or clover every few years. It is true that these plants extract nitrogen from the atmosphere, but we should not forget that their roots go down into the ground much farther than other plants, especially alfalfa, and thus impoverish not only the sur - face soil, but the sub-soil as well. tThe enriching of the soil through the growth of legumes does come so much from the actual growing of legumes on the toil i the feeding of them to farm stock and returning the manure to soil. The nitrogen that the legumes extract from the air is »st all found in the sTems and leaves of the hay. So with the tral ingredients that are extracted from the sub-soil. These are raed to the soil as manure, and its productiveness is thus in- ■ Let us grow leguminous crops as extensively as our rotation permit, but let us feed the same to our stock on the farm. The use of commercial fertilizers has increased very rapidly in this country. We are importing annually from Germany $15,000,000 worth of potash, and the prices of fertilizers when bought are ex - tremely high. As an illustration of this, I will cite an accurately pre - pared table showing the amount of fertility at market value carried off In $100 worth of different farm crops: Fertility Value in $100 Name and Cost. Worth of Produce. Clover, $8.00 per ton $113.52 Alfalfa, $12.00 per ton 75.58 Timothy, $10.00 per ton 51.04 Corn, 40c per bushel 41.62 Oats, 30c per bushel S7.16 Wheat, 75c per bushel 31.47 Milk at $1.00 per 100 lbs., containing 4 per cent butterfat 10 25 Fat Hogs $6.35 per 100 lbs. live weight 4.48 Fat Cattle $4.85 per 100 lbs. live weight 8.28 20 per cent cream, 25c per lb. butterfat „ 1.52 40 per cent cream, 25c per lb. butterfat M Butter, 25c per lb. butterfat 14 </seg>
            <seg id="p062">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 61 It would not be fair to say that all the fertility in clover and alfalfa comes from the soil. The nitrogen is extracted from the Air I want to call attention, particularly to the dairy farmer, to a few items In the above table. When you sell $100 worth of milk at $1.00 per hundred, containing 4 per cent of fat, you remove from your farm 110.25 worth of fertility. When you sell $100 worth of 20 per cent cream at 25c per lb. butter fat, you remove $1.52 worth of fertilizing material. When you sell $100 worth of 40 per cent cream at 25c per lb. butter fat, you only remove 56c worth of fer - tilizing material. Hence, from a fertility standpoint, to say nothing from the other benefits to be derived from skimming a heavy cream, it can be readily seen that it is much better in the interest of soil conservation to sell a 40 per cent cream rather than a 20 per cent cream. It will be noticed that the actual butter fat carries off prac - tically no fertility. The richer the feed in protein the richer it is in fertility elements, because the fertility taken from the soil by the plant is used in building the protein part of the plant. Carbo - hydrates, oil, starch, etc., which make up some 90 per cent of all our plants come from air and water, and when a man is marketing fat, he is really marketing the air and water part of his crop and keep - ing the soil part at home. This is accomplished especially well in dairy farming, owing to the fact that it is the form in which a man comes the nearest to marketing mere fat. I When a man is buying feed of any kind, he is buying a greater ss amount of fertility for his land. For example: About one - of the protein in feed is nitrogen, and from 70 to 90 per cent e nitrogen fed to an animal goes into the manure. The amount ned in the body of the animal depends upon whether it is a ning animal, a growing animal, or a work animal. It will be to say that approximately three-fourths of the fertility contained le feed goes into manure. The percent of potash is quite low in concentrated feeds, owing to the fact that the great majority of the potash required by a plant in in the stem or stalk and in the leaves. Hay, straw and corn fod - der are, of course, i-ich in potash. tit is said the Danes import from the United States our concen - d feeds that are rich in protein, not so much for the profit* may derive from the sale of butter as for the fertility which i feeds add to their soil. I Denmark in many respects is a remarkable country. Fifty 1 ago it was a wheat producing country. Its soils were gradually ; depleted of fertility and agricultural ruin was imminent. The m of farming was at that time changed to a system of dairy ing, with the result that after forty years of dairy farming, the ulture of Denmark is regarded as a model of farm management, from the standpoint of the conservation of the soil fertility and ts per acre. </seg>
            <seg id="p063">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 62 t Another example of what dairy farming has accomplished is d in Holland, where the land is naturally light and sandy and eat deal of it has been reclaimed from the sea. Dairy farming increased the price of their land until it sells for from $500 to I per acre. The population of Holland is at least twenty times ter per acre than that of Nebraska, yet they have an annual aur - of butter and cheese for export amounting to over $4.00 per acre. I Director Thorne of Ohio has pointed out that the increased fer - y of English farms, as measured in increasing wheat yields, has, is opinion, been due to the fact that the cattle, sheep, hogs and &gt;es have increased rapidly per cultivated acre since 1865. In that ', Great Britain was maintaining the equivalent of one head of le for each two acres cultivated, while in 1900 the live stock llation had Increased until there was maintained on British farms equivalent of one head of cattle for every acre cultivated. When Great Britain maintained one head of cattle for each two acre* of land cultivated in grain, the average wheat yield was 28 bushels per acre. When she had increased her number of live stock to the equivalent of one head of cattle to one acre of land cultivated in grain, the yield in wheat had risen to 32 bushels per I Dr. C. G. Hopkins of Illinois, one of our greatest authorities on conservation that we have in this country, says that farm manure ys has been and without doubt always will be the principle mi - 1 used in maintaining the fertility of the soil. i Adding manure to the soil, not only has a fertilizing value of its . but it also sets up a fermentation that frees other plant foods, such iotash. which may be locked up, as it were, and not available for t food until freed by the action of the manure, hence we can see importance of keeping live stock. The keeping of live stock of dnds not only tends to conserve fertility, but it is more profitable i other lines of agriculture. Census figures show conclusively that net Income per acre is greater from stock and dairy farms than l hay and grain farms. Prom statistics of the United States, a few years back, during Beriod of ten years, the average income pr acre from a stock i was $11.42, while that from hay and grain farms was $7.72 acre. tin Illinois, the income per acre from stock farms was $12.55, e that from grain farming was $10.60. In Missouri, the income l live stock was $9.55, while that from grain farming was $7.69. owa, from stock and dairying, $13.17 per acre; from grain, $8.88 acre. In other words, a gain was made in Illinois in favor of stock ling of 18 per cent; in Missouri of 24 per cent and in Iowa of &gt;er cent.

It may come in our time, but it is sure to come. Cheap transportation brought all civilized countries into close competition and there } reason why some of the European lands which are inferior to should be worth four or five times as much per acre as ours. tl look for Nebraska to become one of the greatest dairy produc - etates in this country. If this state takes up dairying and live c there will be no question about the future of Nebraska. Some of us who talk at conventions often wonder what effect or benefit our talk has been to the people. At times certain things come up, however, that remind us of that familiar text "Cast thy bread upon the waters and it will return to thee after many days.' Not, however, like the tramp who called at a pretentious home and asked for something to eat. After the lady of the house had given him the usual lecture about the idle life he was leading in this busy world, she handed him a piece of stale, mouldy bread. The tramp took the bread and looked at it. Then he said: "Madam, when I wis a little boy, I used to go to Sunday school. Among the different things in the bible that the Sunday school teacher discussei was one that T did not believe at the time. It was 'Cast thy bread upon the wat - ers and it will return to thee after many days.' To ascertain whether this was a fact. I threw some bread on the water and from the ap - pearance of this bread, I would think that it was the same piece that I cast upon the waters many, many years ago." Some weeks ago a gentleman called at my office and he bad with him a large chart displaying the records of his herd of forty cows for the past year. I am unable to quote from memory his av - erage per cow, but it was between 300 and 350 pounds of butter per cow for the entire herd. I was naturally pleased and somewhat surprised at such a good showing coming from an unknown quarter, or from one who had quietly worked along intelligent lines without any grandstand display. He said, "Do you remember talking at Man - hattan, Kas., about ten or twelve years ago and telling a story about a certain herd you had inspected and about the amount of butter this man was receiving per cow?" After thinking a moment I recalled the name of E. D. Tilson of Tilsonbury, Ontario, Canada, who waa the owner of the herd referred to. This gentleman said, "When you told that story I went home with the determination to try and build up a herd that could do likewise." After feeing Mr. Merrltt of Kansas records, the above quotation cam* into my mind. Before closing I will repeat the story to which the gentleman referred. Some years ago I had the pleasure of attending a convention of the Canadian Western Dairymen's Association, held at Guelph, On- </seg>
            <seg id="p065">64 .NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION t Canada. There were many excellent addressed delivered, and were very eloquent. It is the custom there for cabinet members, of the provincial and dominion government, to attend these meet - thus showing the importance of the dairy industry in Canada. Of all the addresses I heard at that convention and the big ban - quet I attended afterwards, the one that struck home the most forci - bly was the address delivered by an old gray haired man of 75 years. He was not an eloquent speaker, but he had facts, and facts usually are convincing. In response to a toast, the old gentleman got up and said: "I am not a public speaker. I am a practical, every-day farmer. I believe, however, that I own the best cow in Canada. I fur - ther believe that I have the best herd of cows in Canada. I have a cow that gave 17,770 pounds of milk in nine months. I have a herd of forty cows that produced on an average 4 50 pounds of butter per cow during the past year." His statements were so startling at the time to me that I went 100 miles out of my way to visit his farm to ascertain if they were correct. I found that Mr. Tilson had facts to bear out the statements he had made. He was supposed to be a very wealthy man and had made his fortune in the milling business. After retiring from the milling business, he took up farming as a recreation and bought an 800 acre farm, which had a light, sandy soil, and was somewhat exhausted in fertility from constant grain raising. He said be had two objects in view — to put farming on a practical business basis and to demonstrate to that community that good money could be made at farming without exhausing the fertility of the soil. To do this he chose dairying and hog raising, and I must say that I never visited an experiment station in my life where things were kept up better. Even every particle of manure was saved. The liquid manure from hog pens was run into cement tanks for future use as a fertili - ser on the farm. This herd was composed of Holstein and Holstein grades. His grades were crosses between Holstein and Shorthorn. His bast cow was sired by a Holstein bull, the dam being a Shorthorn. He remarked to me that it was comewhat of a handicap financially to him that a number of his best cows were grades, as he was selling full blooded Hoist eins. When I was there his best cow was between fire and six years old. I asked him if there was not danger in forc - ing a cow, thus burning her out or shortening her period of usefulness. The old man looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said that from a business standpoint it would be better to force a cow for two or three years and make a profit, than to carry her six or seven years without a profit. He said his beat cow had been producing heav - ily ever aince she was a two-year-old with no bad effects yet. Els cows were kept in the stables almost the entire year in large, well ventilated stalls, with running water and salt in each stall 1 no less than six silos and from thirty to forty pounds of insil - ls fed each cow daily. The same being balanced up with various </seg>

He was not affected by drouth, g to the fact that he kept a large supply of insilage during the e year in his silos. His cows were turned out nights during the warm weather to graze. His barns were ventilated by sub-earth i, the air being forced through a series of tubes laid about six under the surface of the ground. This duct extended out about yards from the barn, so that cool air was forced into the barn lg the summer months and warm air during the winter months. While Mr. Tilson's business was carried on in a more elaborate manner possibly than would be practicable for the average farmer, yet the principles that he applied are practicable to every man. tHe has demonstrated that exceptionally fine milkers can be pro - d by using good sires. I was surprised at one remark he made it his grade steers. He said he had found no difficulty in getting highest price for his grade steers when they were ready for the cet. I know that in this country there is thought to be some preju - against the Holstein color in a steer when they go to market. I k, however, this is largely Imaginary. tThe second lesson that may be derived from Mr. Tilson's work quoted, is that he has cheapened the cost of production by furn - g the cow, which is a machine, with an abundant supply of suc - it food during the milking period. Therefore, he has fortified elf against drought. And really, this is the question that con - i the farmers of today more than anything else. The supply and md regulates the price of all food products, unless some artificial is are used for cornering the market, and with some dairy pro - i this would be almost impossible, as the raw material is in the g of the producer. The cost of production is a matter that should concern the producer more than anything else, as this is something entirely under his control. As we have already pointed out, the price is something that he cannot control. The advent of the silo in the west and middle west Is going to be a God-send to the producers or farmers of this country. I There Is no large business of any kind carried on successfully in or any other civilized country unless the economy of production is &gt; first consideration. \ The President: I feel that, as an association, we are very much indebted to Professor McKay for his splendid address this afternoon. I am going to take the liberty of stating at this time that if anybody here would like to have a copy of this address, or would like to cor - respond with Professor McKay at any time on any subject of import - ance to Nebraska dairymen, I am sure he will answer.

I do not know that there is anything further to come up this afternoon. — Adjourned until Thursday, 10 o'clock. Wednesday. January 17 Morning Session. State Farm, January 18, 1912. President Rector called the meeting to order KThe first number on the program this morning for our enter - aent and pleasure is a paper on the subject of "Feeding the r Cow," by Prof. J. H. Frandsen. Before introducing the first speaker before us this morning. I thought it might be of interest to give you a little history of the dairy department at the state farm. Those who have been familiar with what has been going on for the last twenty years will remem - ber that fifteen years ago Prof. A. L. Haecker came among us, then as a mere boy, and became connected with what was then a very small department. Indeed, and as soon as the dairy division of our agricul - tural activitites was organised Professor Haecker took charge of the work and for fifteen years under his administration and care and hard work he has developed what you all know to be one of the largest dairy departments of the agricultural activities here. It was with sincere regret, on our part, that Professor Haecker was enticed away from this position to go into a commercial enterprise. How - ever, after finding that we were to lose Professor Haecker our regents timin to make an effort to find a successor who could fill Professor Haecker's place; and it seems, after canvassing the possible and probable candidates throughout this and other countries, they have united on Professor Fransden. As Professor Frandsen was somewhat of a stranger to us all, I thought I would say a few things regarding his preparations in life for this position that he is now called to fill. i Professor Fransden is of Danish descent. He became interested airy ing early in life and from the farm went to the agricultural sge at Ames, la., and graduated from there. Being interested in commercial side of the dairy work, he went west and took up the agement of the. Hazlewood plant at Portland, Ore., and operated plant as a business man for three years. By so doing we have e knowledge of his experience and what he has gone through and ur judgment it has eminently fitted him for work in bis present Hon. The authorities in Idaho, seeing the success of Professor Frand - sen at Portland, succeeded in enticing him away from there and In - ducing him to take charge of the dairy division of the agricultural department at Moscow and he was there four years before coming here. So we have in our young professor of dairying at our state farm </seg>
            <seg id="p068">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNl'AL CONVENTION 67 and university, a man who has grown up in the west, and been a farm man like the rest of us who went through agricultural colleges. With the experience of three years at Portland and four years at Moscow it gives me pleasure to introduce to you our experienced new super - intendent of dairy husbandry of Nebraska School of Agriculture, Mr. J. H. Frandsen, who will speak to you upon the subject of "Feeding the Dairy Cow." (Applause.) »Ir. Fransden: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: II assure you I appreciate the compliment your chairman has be - ed upon me and I hope I shall merit all the good things said FEEDING THE DAIRY COW. By Prof. J. H. Frandsen. I Before profitable results can be obtained from even the best lods of feeding, it is of course expected that the dairyman has n intelligent attention to the matter of selecting a herd of cows of pronounced dairy type and temperament, such as experience has ht us are most desirable for economical milk production. It is assumed that he realizes the value of keeping a careful and com - &gt; record of the milk and butter fat records of each cow in his . That there is a surprisingly marked difference In the yield of ?r fat from cows in the same herd and kept under the same con - ns, has been frequently noted by the speaker and by hundreds irmers, who have kept records. 1 However, before he decides to part company with any cow of herd, the dairyman's sense of fair play should lead him to care - r investigate the possibility of the cow not having received such Elon as would make it possible for her to be an economical pro - -. It is estimated that in the United States there are about 0,000 milk cows, 3,000,000 of which are unprofitable because ck of proper care and feed. To become a good feeder requires first of all a knowledge of the needs of the individual cows of the herd and of the composition and the palatability of the available dairy feeds. One of the most important factors which has to do with the economical production of milk concerns the amount and the character of feeds consumed. Dairy feeders speak of "The ration of maintenance." By this is meant the amount of feed needed to furnish heat and energy and to rebuild worn out tissue. While the amount of feed necessary to supply actual body needs is about the same whether the cow is milking or rot milking, it must be borne in mind that every pound of milk pro - duced requires an additional amount of feed. Roughly speaking in the case of a good dairy cow, fully one-half of the ration fed goes to supply body needs. Perhaps the poor feeder makes no more frequent mistake than to refuse to give that additional part of the ration that </seg>
            <seg id="p069">68 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION would be exclusively used for milk production. No matter how good a cow may be so far as breed is concerned, she cannot be expected to give in her product what she does not get in her feed. In a general way then, economical milk production means liberal, but not wasteful tending. The Balanced Ration. The feeder who is familiar with the many demands made on the system of a dairy cow readily realizes why it Is desirable to feed a "balanced ration." By "balanced ration" is meant "one in which the protein and carbohydrates are In such proportion as will best suit the needs of the animal." In order to feed intelligently and econom - ically it is essential that the farmer knows something about the constit - uents of the different kinds of feeds and the proportion in which these must be used in order to have a balanced ration. It must now be remem - bered that we are speaking of dairy cows exclusively, and that a bal - anced ration for a dairy cow is in no sense a balanced ration for any other animal — as a beef steer or a growing calf. In fact a balanced ra - tion to not to be regarded as fixed in any case. It is simply an ap - proximate standard which must be varied to suit the individuality of the animal, according to the best judgment of the feeder. Nutrients. The nutrients of food parts, found in all feeding stuffs, in the bodies of animals and in milk, may be classed as follows: Water Mineral substances (found in all plants.) Protein (compounds of nitrogen), carbohydrates (starches sugars, etc.) Fats (oils, etc.) The first of these two required nutrients, viz. water and minerals, while very necessary to good feeding, can usually be supplied without much trouble. An animal fed with the right proportion of the other nutrients will generally receive sufficient mineral matter, since it is found in all feeding stuffs. Pure water should, of course, be sup - plied in abundance. Protein. Protein is the name given to those constituents of feeds which contain nitrogen. Good examples of protein are gluten in wheat, the white of an egg. the lean part of beef and the casein of milk. The principal feeds which contain large amounts of protein are the legumes, such as alfalfa, clover and peas and various meals, as oil meal, cotton-seed meal, gluten meal. In the animal body the chief use of protein is to build up muscle, and to form the casein of milk. It is important that the required amount of protein be fed, since no other constituent can take its place in the formation of muscle and </seg>
            <seg id="p070">69 Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates is the name given a group of feed constituents which contain no nitrogen. In this group are found starch, sugar and crude fiber. Carbohydrates furnish the energy needed to porform the bodily functions. They are also the source of the heat of the system. Carbohydrates also normally furnish the constituents needed for forming milk sugar and the fat in milk. I In the body fat performs the same function as do carbohydrates, chief difference being that fat is a more concentrated form of one pound of it being equal to 2.4 pourfds of carbohydrates, two are interchangeable; that is, one can be made to serve the Me of the other. Classes of Feeds. i Inasmuch as protein and carbohydrates are the two constitu - wlth which the feeder is most concerned it will be of value to lly classify some of the most common Nebraska feeding stuff* two classes: First. Those which contain a large per cent of protein. Second. Those which are chiefly carbohydrates. The feeder can easily see that in order to balance the ration properly it must be made up of feeds from both classes. Feeds Rich in Protein. Alfalfa hay, clover hay, pea hay, bran, oil meal, cottonseel meal, oats, gluten meal, soy beans. Feeds Rich in Carbohydrates. Corn, corn silage, barley, oats, timothy hay, orchard grass, oat straw, carrots, sugar beets, mangel wurzel. Nutritive Ratio— How to Calculate. iThe next question naturally arising is the exact proportion of Dhydrates and protein that the animal needs to do its best work, relation existing between the exact amount of carbohydrates and sin needed by the animal is what is scientifically expressed as the tritive ratio." It is determined in the following manner: Divide the itible carbohydrates plus 2.4 times the digestible fat by the di - ble protein. It hag been determined that the feed value of a pound it is 2.4 times as great as the food value of a pound of carbo - ates, and as both serve the same purpose, it is desirable to re - them to the same standard for the sake of comparison. Take, for example, a ration containing the following amounts of digestible nutrients: </seg>
            <seg id="p071">70 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Digestible protein 2.60 lbs. Digestible carbohydrates 13.2 lbs. Digestible fat 8 lbs. According to the above definition the nutritive ratio would be determined as follows Carbohydrates 13.2 lb«. Pau, .8x2.4 1.92 lbs. Total carbohydrate value 15.12 lbs. 15.12 (carbohydrates) divided by 2.6 (protein) equal 5.8 or one part protein to 5.8 carbohydrates; that is, nutritive ratio equals 1:5.8. When the ration contains a large amount of carbohydrates in proportion to the protein, it is spoken of as a "wide ration." Where the reverse is true it is called a "narrow ration." For dairy cows anything above 1:7 is "wide" and 1.5 is "narrow." The term ration means of course, the amount of feed required by the animal in 24 In the matter of determining the correct nutritive ratio and amount of protein and carbohydrates necessary for the maintenance of the dairy cow much work has been done by Prof. T.

It might be pointed out here that many believe that the best results are obtained when a ration between 1:5.5 and 1:6 is used. In a general way, it is desirable to feed a little too much rather than not enough protein, for the reason that no other nutrient can take the place of the protein, and that a slight excess of protein, can if necessary, serve the purpose of the carbohydrates in the process of milk production. Then again, Investigations show that a slight in- crease in the protein content of a ration has a tendency to increase Its digestibility. In view of these facts here In Nebraska, where alfalfa is so cheap and so abundant, it would seem advisable to feed a ration, the nutritive ratio of which is between 1:5.5 and 1:6. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">72 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION By the use of the table given the farmer can determine approxi - mately the digestive nutrients required by each cow in his herd. He must, of course, always remember that there is no attempt made to lay down a hard and fast rule, since there are several factors aside from the necessary amounts of digestible nutrients, that must be considered in scientific feeding. The judgment of the feeder must in ell cases be considered important. He must study the individuality of the cow and vary the ration accordingly. He must supply a ration which contains sufficient roughage to give the cow the bulk that is Meessary to keep her digestive tract in good condition. The ration must also be palatable, for if the cow will not eat the food placed be - fore her it matters little how nutritious chemical analysis shows It Calculating Rations. iAs before stated, by ration is meant the actual amount of feed ired by the cow during a period of twenty-four hours. In cal - ling a ration we simply mean selecting such an amount of the ■ at our disposal as will contain the right amount of digestible ients. The practical feeder will naturally select as a basis for ration the best and cheapest feed available in his community. I in Nebraska where alfalfa rich in protein grows in abundance, ould certainly be folly to buy large quantities of expensive con - rates to supply the necessary protein content. tAs an example, let us now figure the actual feed ration of a dairy weighing 900 pounds, and giving thirty pounds of milk testing 4 cent butter-fat. From a previous calculation, it was found that a cow would require approximately 2.07 lbs. digestible protein; I lbs. digestible carbohydrates and .582 lbs. of digestible fat. Let it be supposed that the feeding materials on hand are alfalfa, hay, corn silage, ground barley, oat straw. By making several trial calculations we find that the following trial ration comes near enough to our standard for the particular cow in question: Fifteen lbs. alfalfa hay. Thirty lbs. corn silage.

Whether or not the feeder is justified in carefully calculating the rations for his individual cows is for him to decide. It is, however, absolutely necessary to his success that he familiarize himself with the composition of the feeds available, so that he may feed such a mixture as will approximately balance and thus supply the needs of the cow that is expected to yield a maximum product. tin order that the dairy cow may digest her food to the beet ntage it must be remembered that she requires a certain bulk, rding to the best feeding standard, the ration for a dairy cow Id contain from 25 to 28 pounds of dry matter.

This being the it ought to be the business of every dairyman to approach as ly as possible summer conditions throughout the year. In son.e localities of Nebraska the pasturing season is quite short.

Iln many localities no crop better adapts itself to this purpose can be grown more economically than corn.

Now in many parts of the country silos are as mon as other farm buildings and many of our best farmers would k as much of dairying without barns as without a well filled silo. the use of a silo the farmer Is able to retain for feed a larger lunt of the food material found in the fodder than by any other hod now in vogue. The silo furnishes a convenient method of supplying, throughout the year, an abundance of succulent feed for dairy cows. This is espe - cially advantageous, as it does not necessitate any sudden changes of feed with the change of season. It also economizes space, as more feed can be stored away in the silo than in any equal amount in the barn. Different Cows Xeed Different Amounts. I The amount of feed needed by the cow depends upon her capacity roduce and on her body weight. That is, cows of high productive icity need more protein than do those less productive — and like - 1 large cows need more feed for maintenance than do smaller ones. i general way the cow should be fed such an amount as will keep body weight uniform. It is, of course, to be expected that during first few weeks of her milking period the cow will slightly lose in ;ht and during the latter part of her milking period her weight increase, due largely to the rapid development of the foetus and to the fact that at this time there is a natural tendency to lay iome fat. The feeder who understands why he feeds will, of course, avoid the mistake made by so many of our feeders — that of feeding all the cows of the herd the same amount of grain regardless of the pro - ductive capacity of the individual cows or the length of time each has been in milk. Amount to Feed. In a recent bulletin. Professor Eckles of Missouri Experiment sta - tion, gives the following brief and simple rules regarding the amount that should be fed: </seg>
            <seg id="p076">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 75 1. Feed all the roughage they will eat up clean at all times. 12. Feed one pound of grain per day for each pound of butter fat uced per week or one pound of grain daily for every three pound* ilk given. 3. Feed all the cow will take without gaining in weight. Questions and answers in connection with Frandsen's article "Feeding the Dairy Cow." ■ Q. Can a silo be so constructed that the silage will not freeze does it injure silage if it is frozen? A. A silo may be so constructed that the silage will not frees*, but such a silo is much more expensive and as freezing does not seem to Injure the feeding value of silage and no bad results come from feeding it after it thaws, it would hardly pay a person to go to the extra expense of building a frost proof silo. Q. What do you think of oat straw as a feed for cows? I A. Some dairymen claim they get better results by feeding some straw than by adding that much more of alfalfa to the ration. &gt;re there is a tendency to feed large amounts of concentrates I k you will get better results if some oat straw is fed to give bulk be ration. By feeding oat straw with the alfalfa hay the cow will ob - a sufficient amount of carbohydrates, which she will not receive If alfalfa hay alone. I If you have in your possession some book or bulletin on feeding, t you will find tables giving the composition of feeds and the unt required by cows under different conditions. There is one g you should always bear in mind in calculating a ration, and that te per cent of digestibility of the feeds which you select. I might trate that p&lt;5int In this way: now if you have $5,000.00 locked up safe and haven't the combination to that safe your money won't ou much good. Some feeds are less digestible than thers, that is. nutrients which they contain are in such form that the digestive ?s can not act upon them. Q. How much food does a cow require and how can you tell when a cow is receiving the right amount? I A. That is a question which cannot be definitely answered, as food requirement varies with the individuality of the cow. In a ral way feed all the roughage she will eat up clean and in additioa one pound of grain a day for each pound of butterfat produced ng the week or one pound of grain for each three pounds of milk she uces per day. Feed all she will take care of and don't hesitate to to the ration as long as she responds every day by an increased uction of milk without laying on fat. When she begins to gain in ht then it is time to readjust or cut down her feed. Q. How about sugar beets as a feed for dairy cows? A. I think mangel wurzels are preferable to sugar beets, aa a much larger yield to the acre can be obtained. Q. How about carrots? </seg>
            <seg id="p077">76 A. They are good, but you can get better results from man?el wuriels for the reason Just mentioned. Q. What do you think of corn and cob meal? tA. It is very satisfactory feed for dairy cows. The ground cob ly adds bulk, so that it is in such a loose condition in the stomach the digestive juices can act upon it readily. The same result be attained, however, by mixing corn meal with bran or some ' course feed to give bulk to the ration. Q. If a cow is a heavy producer and also inclined to put on flesh is it advisable to change her feed? I A. The dairy cow should be fed just enough to keep her up to maximum production and her body in good condition and of uni - weight. ■ Q. Would you advise that instead of having her put on flesh all while? tA. Tea. A dairy cow should not be fat. That is, she should not ' any superflous fat, for whatever she eats over and above that b is required for the maintenance of body heat and to replace out tissue, should be converted into milk and if there is a tend - to gain in weight it simply shows that the food is not being used e desirable way. Q. Is it more profitable to grind corn fine instead of coarse? I A. I have not carried out any experiments on that point myself, think it is best to grind the corn sufficiently fine that it may be ly digested and then mix it with some coarse feed so that it will form a doughy mass in the cow's stomach. Q. Is it true that when corn is ground as fine as flour that it is apt to cause indigestion when fed to dairy cows? . I A. If ground fine and fed alone it is apt to cake in the cow's lach and stay in that condition so that the digestive juices cannot effectively upon it, but that would not be true if the corn meal mixed with some coarser feed like bran, or by grinding it with the as this prevents caking to the extent that occurs when feeding finely ground corn meal alone.

            <seg id="p078">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNl'AL CONVENTION 77 Eior Frandsen, but I thank you (or the opportunity to say a few about what the school of agriculture is trying to do in helping e this great farm problem. Aa I see it there are two sides as represented by our school of agriculture. The first one is finding things out. That is represented by the state experiment station. Its business is research. There is a great amount of scientific facts to be researched. The second is distribution — distribution of scientific facts alone by experienced workers. The school of agriculture represents that side of it. It represents the side of it in terms of the future, not the present. The present need is being filled in the farmers' institutes, through current papers and meetings like this. The great problem is the development of every young man, who is to be a farmer, for the future of this state. The university school of agriculture is now attempting to do this. We have above five hundred of these in attendance and I hope the school of agriculture is worthily attempting to solve this problem and to guarantee to the future of Nebraska, as well, in genuine citizenship. It has only dawned upon the people of Nebraska and the west within the last few years, and especial - ly In agriculture, to train for the thing the boy or girl is to do in life and the school of agriculture represents just that type of training and that is what the boys and girls of Nebraska, the men and women of the future, of this state need. Our course of study attempts to unite in those the principles and practice which the boy or girl needs on the farm and in the farm home with real training. The school of agri - culture wants to represent that line of distribution in another way, to do it the best it can. It can never teach any great number of yount, men and women over the state, but it can reach many who do not at - tend through those who go away from here. Country schools are doing today just what they did twenty-five years ago, preparing boys and girls to go to the high school; and the high schools are doing just what they did twenty-five years ago. pre - paring them to go into colleges and universities and to enter for pro - fessional life. Over 70 per cent of them never get beyond the eighth - grade. Statistics show this. The time has come when the idea of culture of the young people in the practical affairs of life must begin and we must go into the rural districts, into the high schools and we must carry this course of agriculture as a regular branch of study and not through one semester. We want them to have the real course and training, such training as will produce results. We want all you who are here to feel that this institution is not an institution separate and apart from you. We want you to feel and to know that it is your school, for your sons and daughters and your neighbors and friends and it is in your hands and the work depends upon the people of the state of Nebraska and not merely upon the men who are there as your servants. I thank you. (Applause.) The President: The thanks of this association are Professor Hunt - er's for giving us this talk. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">78 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION I know of no subject more important to Nebraska dairymen or Nebraska creamery men than the cream production. We certainly are all interested in furthering the cream production of this country. The parties who were given this number of the program certainly knew what they were doing when they gave it to Mr. Borman of Kansas. Mr. Bor - man haa addressed us before on many occasions and we are pleased to have him here with us at this time, as we wish to know more of him. We don't even call him "Hon." but we know and want you to know that he Is honorable and we look forward to what he has to say to us with pleasure, believing It will be practical, as well as very inter - esting. Mr. Borman, as a dairyman is a scientific product, and has had large experience on the farm in handling cows and cream, and Is at this time president of the Continental Creamery company of Kansas. He is editor of the Kansas Farmer, having charge of the editorial de - partment, and I take great pleasure in introducing to you the Hon. T. A. Borman of Kansas. Mr. Borman waa received with great applause. Mr. Borman: Mr. President and gentlemen of the convention I came here part of the way by rail and part of the way by auto - mobile. I am sorry now I didn't take the automobile all the way. I understood I was to appear on the program for an afternoon speech. I presume it is my mistake that all my papers and notes are in my grip at the hotel. Intended for an afternoon address. I will do the best I can at an off-hand Ulk. The subject of cream production, of course, is a subject that is very close to the heart or hearts of the ideal dairy farmer. I would not, it I could, have every farmer in Nebraska an exclusive dairy farmer. We are not all built on the same plan of exclusive dairymen. The gen - eral farmer is, in my judgment, a man who should have on his farm ten or twelve good cows. Those cows need not be of the highest type of dairy bred animals. I doubt if the average farmer would make a success with those kind of cattle. It is my judgment, however, that the farmer, the man who owns eighty or one hundred and sixty acres of land, cannot afford to overlook the income from ten or twelve good cows. When I say ten or twelve I state the probable number of cows that the farmer can milk with his own help. The number of cows, in B&gt;T judgment, which a farmer should milk, should be limited to the number of cows which he can conveniently and easily, with h:s own help, milk and properly take care of. The average Nebraska cow. and the Kansas cow is no better, is a pretty poor sort of cow. I don't &gt;t - lieve, however, that the cow is quite as poor as our system of feeding or our method of handling the cow. If we should properly feed and properly handle the cows which we have the product of our cow in butter-fat would be easily two or three times that which it Is today. I think further that most of the farms on which the ten or twelve cows are milked that if the farmer should cut out four of that ten he wculd </seg>
            <seg id="p080">79 have less in that bunch of cows which would be way above the aver - age and that those six properly taken care of would yield 100 per cent profit apiece, the same as he would realize from the ten, on the same kind of feed and at very much less expense in handling. I believe that the common cow, however, furnishes a very good foundation stock for the upbuilding of a great dairy herd. When you have dairy animals selected, It is my judgment that it is the right move for the farmer to introduce into that herd some dairy blood. The idea is that a herd producing three hundred and three hundred and fifty pounds of butter - fat should be aimed at. It is well that we aim high because the dairy herd will be ultimately just what we intend that it should be. If our idea is high, if we Mt a high mark for production in cream it Is by so doing that we can reach it. We can reach it if we are determined so to do. The grade of animal such as we can produce in ageneration or two from the best stock which we now have will and can be made. In my judgment, to produce three hundred and fifty pounds of butter per year. When we have such a cow as that a product of the present cow, this dairy business will take on a very different aspect. I know It is true in Kansas, and presume it Is in Nebraska, that milking of cows or the dairy business is looked upon very much as a drudgery In a great many instances. In too many Instances, I might say, this is true, but if dairying is a drudgery, it is because we make it so. Every man who works at a shop makes money. He makes the same money if he is willing to work there and likes the job. We consider dalryinng un - pleasant and a drudgery business because we don't think it makes very much money. I believe that, as a matter of fact, a larger per cent of the butter-fat produced in Kansas and Nebraska is pretty nearly clear profit to the farmer. I believe that it is so generally considered for the reason that these cows are milked only a short time of the year, possibly on pasture when they produce most abundantly; at any rate a large percentage of our butter-fat is produced without any increase cf feed over and above a maintenance ration in order to get that butter - fat. Consequently, I believe that dairying, even as we are doing it to - day, is profitable. I believe it is pretty near a pick-up on our farms. I believe that dairying is considered profitable especially during the grass season, but when it comes to the matter or producing butter-fat in the winter time, when we ought to produce tt, we have not got to the point where we can produce that butter-fat at a profit at which we should produce it. In order to produce winter butter-fat at a profit it is necessary to have the right kind of feed and it is also quite nee— sary to have a cow that will properly handle that feed. I know of no way of selecting the best cow from our herds and establishing a point to begin with in building up this herd other than that of testing the milk. This method of applying the Babcock test to the cow is a la - borious process. It does involve some labor, but the results are well worth the labor. I assure you that if there was any other method of determine the relative difference between cows, that method would </seg>
            <seg id="p081">80 have been presented a long time ago. The only way a man is going to know whether his cream is good or poor or whether he has good or poor cows, is by the use of the Babeock test in some way or other. In regard to the matter of feeding — some fifteen years ago when I was feeding cows and milking them, the feeding situation was very different from what it is as compared with today. In those days we were able to make up a very satisfactory ration from the common farm feeds, such as kafftr forage, sorghum forage and millet and oat hay, and good prairie hay, but the day when a satisfactory ration can be made up from those feeds is past, the day of which I am speaking, the day of $4 bran. I have hauled, I think I am safe in saying, many hun - dreds of tons of bran from the mill at the cost of $4 and $5 per ton. When a man can buy bran at that price and make up a satisfactory ration with the other feeds which I have mentioned and some roughage with some cotton and linseed meal to be added, he has a cheap and ef - fective ration. But with bran selling as it is today at $20 to $22 per ton — that is the price in Topeka — those days are past and it is quite necessary for the farmer to feed more corn meal now than in those days. I remember very well that if we talked about a balanced ration before a body of this kind in Kansas half the people would make a break for the door and would not listen. It was regarded as super - flous talk and considered a matter which was beyond the reach of the farmer. In Kansas and Nebraska today a balanced ration is alfalfa bay and corn silage or alfalfa bay and corn. We do not have to use the balanced ration. If we keep those four things in our minds we will have a feed which will exceed the corn meal and the results will be far better by present day methods if we take the right cow. In Kansas most of the farm will produce alfalfa and most of our farms will pro - duce rorn or kaffir corn and that kind of feed and that roughage will make a good milk ration, producing effective results. However, on most of our farms we have learned the value of alfalfa hay and the value of the silo and we have reached the point in our dairy farming where we can better afford to sell these other products and use silage" in our ration. The silo is a new Institution in Kansas, not having been used so extensively as in the last two or three years. There are now some sixteen hundred silos in the state of Kansas and I don't know of a single instance where a man was using a silo but what he says he is sorry he did not have it fifteen years ago, and does not know why he did not have it and feels certain that he has lost the price of the silo by being behind the times in not having one. I am satisfied that either in dairying or in beef production or in the general line of live stock husbandry that every farmer who has ten or twelve head of milch cows is losing enough money every day to pay for a silo. If that is so then why not let us have a silo and so prove conclusively that fact? Every man who Is in any way connected with the purchase of cream, or in increased production of the butter of this country or the in - creased prosperity of this country is, in my Judgment, advocating the </seg>
            <seg id="p082">81 tl know of bankers In Nebraska, I know of bankers in Kansas, who loaned money during the past year to farmers in their respective ities in order that these farmers might build silos and that they not charged these farmers any interest on the money loaned to — the idea being purely to get silos introducd into the neighbor - and to demonstrate the value of silage. Our butter in order to yield us the return which we should ex - pect from the use of our labor and the expenditure of our means and our thought should be produced economically. It makes no difference whether butterfat is worth 35c per pound there is an occasional far - farmer here and there who is today producing 35c per pound butterfat at the cost of 8c or 9c per pound; and every farmer can do that if he will stable his cows, if he will cut out the unprofitable members of his herd that he is now milking and if he will provide the remaining cows with the crops that grow on every farm and store it in his silo, he can realize a much higher an larger percentage of profit from his butterfat than anything else that can be produced on his farm. After this butterfat has been produced the attention of the dairyman has not been entirely relieved. It requires good butterfat to make good butter. Nebraska and Kansas or any other state is forced to sell its butter in competition with the best butter that is produced in this country. If, as a matter of fact, you produce bad butter, Nebraska must sell this butter in the market of the world in compltition with the best butter. It stands us in hand, therefore, that the producer deliver first class cream in order to make the best butter. The care of this cream is no different than the care of the cow. Good care in the case of the cow and good care in the case of cream seems to be absolutely necessary and to do this business as it should be done is no more laborious than is any other work that requires attention. My meaning of that is this, that is is as easy to give the cow the right kind of care as it is to give it the wrong kind of care in order to produce good cream as it is to produce poor cream. Consequently the good cream ought to be produced. In order to be heavy in fat it ought to be produced from a clean separator, a separator which is washed after every separation and not washed only two or three times a week as is the caee in some isolated instances. The milking should be clean. If this cream is produced in a cleanly manner which is possible, and it can be done with but little labor, the production of good cream and good butter has been accomplished. In this state as in Kansas almost every farmer has a wlndmil&gt; — if he has not he ought to have or a gasoline engine, or some means of keeping his water at an even temperature with a continuous steady flow of cold water from his well which conducts the water to the stock tank, which is necessary for the production of good cream. If this cream has the animal heat removed from it as soon as the separation is done and is held at a temperature of well water in this country and is protected from the sun which protection any farmer can secure — it does not mean a silk </seg>
            <seg id="p083">82 rrt, it means at least a blanket or clean carpet drawn over the By this method he can deliver the cream in good condition. In the matter of cream production It is very necessary in my mind, to have the right kind of feed and plenty of it fed to the beat of our common class of cattle, those cattle, of course, to be selected as we go along. Every man having a herd of ten or twelve cows has several heifer calves in the herd and consequently has that number to dispose of every year. If he is in the dairy business he ought to know the good heifer calves from his good cows and ought to save them. He should have the animals which are held for building up his herd. If the farmer or dairyman sells his good heifer calves he has nobody to blame but himself, and it is the feed and the cows and the proper care of the cream and the delivery of good cream that counts in the business. Now, in the matter of grading up a herd, if you propose to get Into the game a little deeper a man can make no mistake in my judg - men in his selection of any one of the leading dairy breeds. A person Deed not quibble or hesitate whether it be Holsteins, Jerseys, Ayr - shires, Guernseys or what. By selecting that kind of a bull for use in his herd buying from a' breed which he likes, you know some people like gray clothes, some like black, they don't know why but some people like one color and some another, and eo it is true of cattle, some like black cattle and some like another color, a farmer or dairyman can hardly make any mistake in following out his individual preferences in that respect. The cost of a good bull is not very great. I noticed the other day an advertisement in the Jersey Breeder in which the advertiser was offering six months old bull calves from registered cows at the cost of $150 to $250 each. Lots of farmers would pay $75 to $80 to some neighbor of his for a scrub bull which probably would not be worth more than $8 or $10 per head. It seems to me that $250 for the right kind of a bull to serve your herd is not unreas - onable. That same male can also serve three or four herds in the community if three or four farmers will go in together in the deal and buy such an animal. So that really there is no reason why a farmer or anyone who wants to build up his dairy herd cannot do so. Therefore let us get the matter of dairy herd Improvement started. In almost every locality I think there must be someone who to following out this line that I have outlined here. This man is realising a nice income from his cowa. He has set his head on (in - proving his herd. He does not peddle the news around among his neighbors to any extent; the demonstration is there. If some farmer ten or twelve miles from you has a silo and some fellow comes along and talks to you about building a silo you go over and find out all about how he built It and how he filled it and you look at it. Very •oon the thing you do is to spot the farmer in your locality who is making the largest amount of money from his cows and you go over end see him and find out how he does it. Don't enthuse over every- </seg>

It Is likely it is written from the standpoint of a man who is In the dairy business exclusively and is written from the standpoint that he considers right; but please remember that involved in all of these statements is the practical principle. It is so practical that it can be worked out by every farmer who has a desire to do. so; and there is no reason in the world why the Income from the dairy products on every farm should not be increased three, four or even five times with very little Increased expenditure of labor. Gentlemen, I thank you. We will now adjourn until 1:00 o'clock. Afternoon Session, Thursday, January 18, 1912. The president in calling the Association to order stated that in consequence that they had not finished the morning session the first paper would me the subject of "Cream Grading" by Dean Ed H. Webster. In the meeting it was stated that there were fifty thousand hand separators or upwards in our state, that means that there are many grades of cream being purchased in Nebraska at this time (laughter) and it further means that this is one of the most important subjects that we have under consideration today and one of the serious problems that interest us as dairymen and creamerymen alike. We have, to present this subject to us, Dean Ed. H. Webster. He is known to many of us and to those who do not know him I would say that he is a Kansas product but was a Nebraska product. Kansas slipped this one over onto us and he was connected with the Kansas dairy School and from there he went to the Iowa Dairy School and from Iowa back as a teacher in the Kansas School of Agriculture. From there we find he has had one or more years experience in western Kansas, Nebraska and Eastern Colorado as a station operator. While engaged in that work he edited and printed some very valuable bulle - tins that we all have in our libraries covering many points of im - portance concerning the Babcock test and other matters of interest to the dairy business. Next we find him in the dairy division of the department of agriculture at Washington. Then Kansas called him again and be is at this time dean of the school of agriculture at Manhattan. What he doesn't know about cream grading none of us here need attempt to state. In introducing Hr. Webster I feel that I am doing for the State of Nebraska the best it is possible to do in this country in the way of giving you authority on this important subject. Mr. Webster: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: You see what you escaped by my not being born in Nebraska: After that sort of an introduction I might say that there was a reason why I was not born in Nebraska. My father in early days when most of you were boys had a good deal of experience in Western Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p085">84 and he atterward* settled in Kansas because be did not like the Northwest country. The question I am to discuss with you for a little while this afternoon is one which Mr. Borman touched upon a little while this morning. I admit that it is perhaps the most important question for the farmer and the creanieryman in this country today. There is no question im my mind at all but what the permanent dairy industry is not going to be established or developed on second, third of fourth grade products but is going to be established on first grade product. As your chairman has intimated you have fifty thousand separators in Nebraska. I presume there are that many in Kansas. That makes one hundred thousand machines for separating cream in this country. There Is surely somehing ahead for file creamery man and dairyman to do along these lines. tl want to go a little Into the history of the cream grading busi- There are some things I want to state orally. I have written : here some of those things in order not to omit anything in d to the subject but the most of my talk will be oral. CREAM GRADING. Dean Ed. H. Webster. There has not been a month in the past ten years that the creamerymen west of the Missouri River have not had brought to their attention in • forceful way, the fact that cream must be graded. Creamerymen have not agreed on anything in point of methods or details. They do not at this moment agree even that it can be done, although they nearly all agree that it must be done. » Spasmodic efforts have been made to grade at the buying end — e churning end and at both ends — some have graded out a few of the best cream, some a few cans of the worst cream and some tried to establish a happy medium in which all of the best and of the worst would make the beet butter or all of the worst and of the beet would not make the worst butter. In most cases the has got the worst of it and the worst has got the best of it. The past ten years has seen a wonderful development in the art of making butter. In the refinement of method, the application of scientific methods, the standardization of the product, the systemiztng of factory practice, the creameryman of today has attained the un - attainable of a decade ago. He is making better butter out of worse cream than he was then. I With all the advances in the factory the methoJ of gathering the product has suffered a movement backward nearly equal to the nee made in the creamery. </seg>
            <seg id="p086">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 85 §The problem of the next ten years is this — to make as decided ovement in gathering the cream and getting it into the factory e have made in the work in the factory. I To the solution of this problem the creameries should give their energies — the dairy commissioners dairy schools — the federal department and the dairy papers should focus their attention gly on the problem and keep it there until a solution is reached. tHere is a great food manufacturing business amounting to many ons of dollars a year which has no control on the quality of its material. There is not a parellel like this in any other industry It is not necessary to go into details concerning the causes that have lead up to such a state of affairs. They are known to practically everyone of you. The cream producers may not relize how serious the situation is but they can readilly see that the present system of local competition between the merchants in the small towns for the cream business is the best thing ever devised for getting the poorest possible cream. The local merchant's business is to sell goods and if he can gain a few customers by taking a cream agency he Is not going to handle the cream business in a way that will drive trade away from this store or shop. If the merchant can slip one over on his competitor by taking cream that the other may have conscientious - ly refused and thereby gain a customer who will in a year net him a greater profit than all his cream business put together he is going after that farmer's business, the creamery be hanged, they can do something with the stuff. Do the farmers stop to consider the re - sults of this practice. For a temporary gain he in lowering the standard of the business that means something to you. The farmer pays the bill in the end. tlf standards of quality for cream are established and universally led it will result in increased profits to the farmer. If such lards are conscientiously enforced the farmer will not object hem more than he now objects to the grain standards — if they Id not be enforced with justice he would have a right to object, not believe that the creameries have anything to fear so far as producers are concerned if they will stand together for a rigid iardization of the cream business based an purely commercial provided they deal justly and fairly with their patrons. The basis of such standardization is the most deficient part of the program. During the summer of 1903 an attempt was made to establish such a basis. The work was done by the federal dairy divi - sion in co-operation with one of the largest creamery companies of that time, a system was adopted and given a practical trial for ten months and failed. Its failure was due to the open antagonisms of competing creameries. The system was not perfect but It worked and had it been generally adopted could in time have been made into a system that would doubtless have, made the history of the cream </seg>
            <seg id="p087">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 86 Kness read differently these past few years. The standards that d at that time have been enforced would not apply today. The rea - for this is simple. The creameries were then getting better cream they are today. t There were scoffers then who said they took no stock in the theo - of a government agent or a dairy school creamerymen. They want - omething practical — worked out by practical men. However, this cular creamery corporation put its own practical men into the itlgatlon, paid most of the bills and intepreted the results. To i practical men the results looked so good that they chanced sev - thousande of dollars in the mechanical equipment and the training en to give it a thorough trial. They failed only because those who refused to believe that it could be done made it impossible of k Since that time spasmodic attempts have been made to curb the ing evil, but no one has had the hardihood to risk much in the apt. There is an old saying that "those who come to scoff remain to pray." The meeting has been somewhat prolonged but it has been in session every minute since that summer of 1903, and reached its climax in a session in Kansas City the past summer, where nothing but prayers were uttered. It is barely possible that some of the same men who nine years before were scoffers entered this meeting with an humble and contrite spirit. The astonishing thing about that meeting was the proposal to establish at once a grading system, the principle of which was identical with that worked out nearly ten years ago, which proposed standard - ising the cream on basis of the amount of acid it contained. It was found at that time that a very small amount of acid, relatively speak - ing, could be taken as the dividing line between first and second grade. This was arrived at after taking hundreds of samples at both ends of the transportation line and comparing results. The acid test was the only feasible test found and it proved its worth. The stand - ard selected approximated the souring point of milk. This was for summer delivery. Cream was good enough then to furnish a respect - able amount of first grade cream on this severe standard. iThe standard proposed at the meeting this summer was for four - is per cent acid, or No. I cream could contain approximately twice men acid as was thought necessary ten years before. Your speaker not believe that this was a workable standard under conditions bey existed during the summer just passed and asked for time take some investigations as to the present conditions. The request granted and a committee of creamerymen appointed to assist dairy commissioner of Kansas and your speaker in formulating &gt;rkable plan. A preliminary investigation was conducted during July and Au - gust at three different points in Kansas. It was shown conclusively </seg>
            <seg id="p088">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 87 Pmy contention that .4 per cent was not a fair standard for summer ths such as last summer furnished. A standard of .5 per cent Id have allowed a small percentage of the cream to grade No. 1, e .6 per cent would have forced more than 50 per cent of it into t. When the committee got together in September the result of the investigation was given to them and plans proposed to conduct aa exhaustive test for twelve months, beginning January 1, 1912, la order to get all the tacts together and work out a standard that would meet all the changing conditions of season and weather. The proposi - tion met with the instant approval of the committee. We hare now in progress one of the most exhaustive teats ever undertaken in this field. Ten towns have been selected. There are from two to four com - panies buying cream in each. Bach creamery had to agree to stand by the work for one year and do their part in making it a success. Each buyer had to rm&gt;k' a s&lt;ir(1s&lt;- rrepnipni. The cream was to be graded by the acid teat, the standard to be changed from time to time as the work progressed if found necessary — a difference of 2c is made between No. 1 and No. 2 cream — No. 3 is unsaleable cream. Kany party to the agreement fails to do their part we discontinue town and go to another town. Every buyer in town must come the agreement. Eighteen days have passed and things have off in a most satisfactory manner. We are looking for results that will enable us to formulate a law that can be presented to the next legislature in Kansas, 1913. What form such a law will take we have no means of knowing at the present time, but hope to whip it into shape as we get more light in this per - plexing subject. Continuing orally, Dean Webster spoke as follows: "There was a method which was tested out some nine or ten years ago by one of the large creamery companies and adopted after hun - dreds of samples of cream had been tested and graded out, cream com - ing from many parts of the state of Kansas, and it was then determined that there should be a division between first and second grade cream, that seemed to be the most feasible way. Those of you who are buy - ing cream today know how much cream and how long you can keep it before it turns sour. At that time we got a large amount of No. 1 cream upon that test. This work was also done in the summer time. The cream was good enough then to furnish a respectable amount of second grade cream. Perhaps this might not be done during the sum - mer just past. A committee of creamerymen was appointed and a pre - liminary investigation was conducted during July and August during laat summer at three different points in Kansas. It was called to my attention that it was not a fair standard for the summer months. On that basis there would not have been one pound of No. 1 cream deliv - ered at any one of these three towns at which cream was delivered. When the committee got together they made an exhausted examina- </seg>
            <seg id="p089">88 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION tion in order to get all the facts together worked oat by a standard that would meet all requirements and conditions. We have now in progress one of the most Intense investigations yet made. Ten points have been selected at which from two to four creamery companies are buying cream in each town. Each creamery company has agreed to stand by the work for one year and do their part in trying to make it a success. We are looking for results that will enable us to formulate a law that can be presented to the next legislature, which meets in 1(13. We do not know what form the law will take, but we are gath - ering all the information that will be necessary to base such a law upon and worded in such a way that It can be made to stand the test of our courts In the states. We hope by the experiment to devise a grading system that can be universally maintained by any court in Kansas. This subject is one of the most important. These facts that I have presented to you show something of the history and work that has gone forward. The creamerymen now without explanation admit that cream grading has reached the point where we cannot dllly dally with the question any longer. We must devise some plan whereby we can put the buying of cream on a healthy basis, where it is centainly not at the present time. This whole question on the subject of grading cream goes back further into the personalities of each one of us. When we come to say individually that this is clean and this is unclean we are expressing our personal view of the matter. Our personal views may differ widely. It reminds me of a story told of an Irish woman who called her physi - cian in because of her sick child. He asked something in regard to the life of the household and cleanliness and asked if she had a bath tub. "Tea," she said she had, but she thanked the Lord she had never had any use for it. Her idea of cleanliness differed from us who consider the bath tub necessary, but the difference is In regard to our Ideas of cleanliness as we see it personally. To get a law passed that will force a man to see cleanliness as another man sees it is an extraordinarily hard proposition. You can talk cleanliness to the farmer. You can take a hog and put him in your parlor and keep him there ever so long and train him and then turn him out Into the yard again and he will still be as dirty as ever. There are other animals in the same category. This matter of cleanliness in handling of cream products is according to the idea conveyed to us through our standpoints of viewing the mat - ter and not from what somebody else says. It is a born char - acteristic of the man or woman. It is a characteristic that can be trained and trained easily, if we go at it in the right way. We have to look to the future for the final outcome of this matter in a large degree. Law will not do every - thing in this respect. We must educate and read up In our sense o* deanliness. We must raise up and educate people who are intuitively clean and who will deliver clean cream. Some people will deliver clean cream because they have that characteristic and sense of duty. </seg>
            <seg id="p090">89 They do not care to do anything else. It would violate their conscience if they did anything else. Then we will begin to get a clean article of food. We can direct it somewhat by law, but we cannot convert the whole category of things that happen to food products. A man thai doe* not know what cleanliness is will perhaps do the same thing re - gardless of the law. We must begin to do it by force of law, however, and by bringing the attention of people to things that must be done from a sanitary standpoint. We must begin training the young genera - tion along these lines. I believe that a training of this kind ought to go into our public schools everywhere throughout the whole country. We ought to begin teaching the boys and girls the difference between what is dirty and what is clean in their habits. In that way we can get get good habits and it will not take a law to enforce it after a little Take the case of the Dutch Housewife who has but two rooms in her house. In one end she does all her work and lives in the other end and she keeps her house clean. She does it not because of the law but she does it because she is nice and clean in all her operations and she makes her dairy products clean and nice. She does not know how to do otherwise and she trains her children Just as she was trained by her mother before her to do things in a nice clean way. As long as we have mothers and fathers in this country who have not that sanitary feeling and cleanliness, the idea that makes them clean, we cannot hope that they will take any pains in training their children in what they do not know. I think the training along this line should be in the schools. And there is another thing of getting the children to thinking about these things in the school. If a child learns that this way or that way is not clean from a sanitary standpoint that child is going home and and will be a teacher to its father and mother along those lines. It will have an Influence far beyond what we may think in changing the atmosphere of that home. The surroundings and doing of things of that kind in the home, the training, must begin with the child and go all through its life. Millions are brought up in America with no other idea than that of getting riches and wealth. The cream grading prop - osition must be begun with the older people and certain restrictions thrown around the question of the manufacturing of food products If we are going to be sanitary. We shalll never reach the ultimate result until the people take hold of this and have a feeling within them that they are right. If there are any questions that any one wishes to ask I will answer now. I am not in a condition to speak longer as I am just recovering from an attack of bronchitis. Q. D«es the per cent of butterfat effect the quality of the cream? A. It afTects the commercial Quality I think? If it be a high per cent of butter fat it is worth more per pound. Q. How does it affect the quality. </seg>
            <seg id="p091">90 A. Traces of bacteria do not develop as rapidly in heavy cream as they do in thin. That would be the difference. Q. Wherein would a law of that kind benefit the producer? A. In raising the standard of the whole business and put It on a higher plain and in this way the farmer would profit. Q. Does it affect the central creameries west of the Missouri rl»er? A. They have the aame proposition there. Q. Speaking of sour cream, there is no difference and I would like to know whether you mean ripe cream or regular sour cream. A. Any cream that is in process of decomposition. Sour cream is partially rotted cream. Q. In churning do you churn sweet cream? A. We do not usually because the butter trade has for years been used to ripened cream product. There are some creameries that churn absolutely sweet cream, and more of them would If they could get the product. Q. Is the present condition of the cream all due to the producer? tA. No, it is not. As I said the first opportunity given to grading a by one of the largest creameries in my state was broken down ise other creameries would not join with them in the proposition. Q. When the cream is allowed to stand on the platform until the temperature is very much increased there is no encouragement. What do you recommend? tA. There are lots of things that have to do with it besides that, ouree, the farmer is the first one that has to do with the cream. ? spoils it there is nothing on earth after that to restore it. He Id have the incentive to take the best of care of his cream from the . He can get more for it if he takes the proper care of his cream the better care that he takes of it the more he will get. Q. In order to keep cream sweet will it have to be delivered the same day? A. That depends. It is a matter of detail. Q. If I have to deliver my cream every day and go every day eight or ten miles to deliver it I cannot do it. A. It is not a matter of delivering cream every day in order to deliver it sweet. I bad a farmer deliver me his cream twice a week during the summer and I never received better cream in my life than I received from that man and It has been delivered at the station when the temperature was as high as 98 degrees. From the record last summer I observe that a lot of cream was delivered at the station at as high a temperature as 98 degrees. You cannot expect to produce good cream delivered under those conditions of cleanliness and temperature. Of the two, temperature is the most important, from the fact that at certain seasons of the year the cream is bad. Then again when the weather gets cooler the cream comes in in a fairly good condition. Patrons were not taking any more care in regard to cleanliness at </seg>
            <seg id="p092">91 I period than when the weather is warm. If the cream is at a perature of 60 or even below 70 and delivered at the station at temperature I am satisfied that you can deliver good sweet cream ny time during the summer and do it twice a week. You can de - ' cream of that kind much longer when you keep it cool and you ship cream a long distance without it fomenting. I think the enting is entirely due to the care of the cream on the farm. 1 remember when we used to make the best butter in the country. as when I got whole milk at the factory. It would come in and would separate it on Saturday morning, cool it and churn the m on Monday and we never had any trouble with the cream at time. After cream has once been cooled it don't heat up rapidly. Q. I would like to ask if you would call 35 per cent rich cream' A. From 35 per cent to 40 per cent is rich cream. Q. How would a farmer have to be situated in order to keep cream four days when the temperature was at 100 to 110 degrees? I A. If you hare cool water, ordinary well water, erect a milk se large enough to keep a barrel in and use a shotgun can and the water run around the can. Never mix the warm cream with previous cold cream until warm cream has had time to cool and f the same temperature of the previous separations. If you do this will never have any trouble in keeping the cream sweet. tQ. I have erected a little ice house and I think I am clean and ; all these precautions. I separate my cream in the separator as as milked and then I have a cream cooler and then I cool it down ,e right temperature, but I seem to have trouble. You can come up I and see it when the temperature is as it was last summer and if sweet and nice when it is received at the creamery I'll pay your ex - es and give you a square meal. (Laughter). KDean Webster: I will come up at any time and give you a onstration. I operated one of the largest cheese factories in Can - where milk for cheese had to be sweet, and it was customary for farmers to keep milk from 12 to 24 hours. If milk can be kept it you can keep cream sweet. Q. Well, that is up in Canada and not in Nebraska. ■ A. The temperature, however, was at 100, as well as in Nebraska Kansas. IQ. We are farmers and we have farm conditions. You are dairy- HP at the top notch and have every appliance that the state can sh, while we do not have those appliances. KA. I have been through all of it and I am simply speaking from experience. t). I am a farmer sending a good deal of cream to the cream - think there is nothing that will spoil milk or cream quicker than Ixlng warm cream with cooled cream or cream that has been pre - ly cooled. </seg>
            <seg id="p093">92 A. 1 think that will spoil the cream quicker than all other things combined. I have tried it again and again. And also pouring warm n.ilk into cold milk without cooling the warm milk before mixing it will i &lt; rtainly spoil the whole batch. It takes time to cool the milk, but it should be thoroughly cooled before two milkings can be mixed. tA Member: I took a can of cream to the station laet summer on ay evening just before the arrival of the train and I put it on the orm. Sunday when I went to church I saw the can sitting there, nt back Monday morning and gave the railroad man a jacking up told him that I would report him to the company. I expected when I my returns from that can of cream that it would be a very low e of cream, whereas, I got in return No. 1 grade. (Laughter.) Mr. Webster: Those are business adjustments and they must be taken care of. We must understand each other better, the creamery - men understand the farmer and the farmer the creamerymen. The more information each can get about the other the better for all con - cerned. I think a whole lot of this discussion comes from lack of def - inite and positive information, a good deal of it from hearsay and is paased around and in that way it becomes easy to believe that the farmer has not received justice. All concerned ought to know and be informel of all these facts and all stand together and help protect the farmer and each other along these lines, especially if the farmer is discriminated against. Q. What is the result on cream if allowed to freeze? I am sat - isfied from my own observation and experience that If cream is tested in all right, but goes in at so high a temperature it is certainly in - jurious to the cream, and I doubt if it will get sweet again. That is a question I would like to have answered especially in regard to the freezing of it. I know of two cans coining in this winter frozen solid and some of it bursting the cans. It is a question that might be of in - -t to us all. I know sometimes agents are careless in letting cream stand out. I took a can to DeWitt only a week ago and said to the agent, "Had it not better be put inside?" it being a cold day, but he simply laughed and said, "Yes, I guess so." This is a matter I would like to know who is to blame and if a can of cream was left there and it froze solid what will be the result when it is thawed out and how would it test? I A. It would not hurt it at all If properly sampled and tested. If would attempt to sample it in that condition you would either an extraordinary high or low test. The fat itself does not freeze, cream to freeze does not hurt the intrinsic value of it for churn - but it is a nuisance for anyone who has anything to do with it. The President: I am sorry we cannot continue this discussion longer. We are very fortunate in having Dean Webster with us thin time. This subject has been discussed in its many phases and I feel as though I would like to say a word or two myself before the discus - sion closes on account of being a dealer in cream and interested in </seg>
            <seg id="p094">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 93 &lt; reameries in this state. It is very interesting indeed to hear this mat - ter discussed pro and con. I want you all to understand that from the creamerymen'e standpoint we are fully as much or more interested in this one subject as anyone here can be under any circumstances. You are farmers and the dairy business is only a part of your income, a part of your daily work. The creamery companies not only have your welfare at stake, but every dollar they have is invested in the cream - ery business and every day and every week and every month of every year is put in in devising ways and means to manufacture this cream in the best possible condition in which they can get it, into the best possible butter than can be made and make use of the best ma - chinery and have the best management that can be had. It seems to me there are only a few pertinent points that are at issue here today. Cream is a very simple product. It comes from the old cow absolutely l&gt;ertect. You all have separators of one make or another for the extrac - tion of this cream or butterfat from your milk. We as creamery com - panies don't care for the skim milk. We don't want it and there are various reasons for it, first we have to pay transportation on it and sec - ond the skim milk that your butterfat is taken from the quicker you separate it the more butterfat you will get and the higher the per rent you skim the less you will have to pay transportation on and the less cans to clean. As I said in my opening talk yesterday; many farmers have for years past been writing our company and all com - panies in this state for a few practical suggestions as to how they may produce cream for delivery to make the best quality of cream Our answer has always been, and I think the creamerymen in this audience will agree, that they are very simple, with only three or four points to remember. First is to skim the milk as soon as it comes from the cow while warm. I am told that it has been a common prac - tice to let the night milking remain until morning before separating it in order to save washing the separator. Send the milk as soon as you can get it from the cow to the separator which is the proper temperature to separate it. Why should you want to take out more than eight or ten pounds of that whole milk from the milk in order to get the butterfat. It is unnecessary. Any separator that you can buy today will skim clean and skim easily 40% but - terfat. Prof. McKay made a remark that 35% butterfat was high test. Our experience in testing is gradually getting higher. The best dairymen and the best people in the State of Nebraska today make money at that. When you skim at 40% and 50% you keep out n'ore skim milk for use at home. We do not want the skim milk. We don't want to buy it or pay for it. The farmer needs it for his calves and pigs and you should keep it on your farms. Ninety pounds of skim milk out of every hundred, if you remember, belongs to you and you should keep it on your farm. When we go out to buy whole milk it must be worth something to you. We cannot buy it. We have use for whole milk as a starter, and we buy a limited amount of it but </seg>
            <seg id="p095">94 to do our best we cannot get enough farmers together to keep us sup - plied with any volume of whole milk. When we go to buy it they want lc per pound for it and I take it that it must be worth something to them. We don't care for it. If you will skim cream from forty to fifty per cent and take that ten pounds of cream immediately from the separator, cool it down in water to as low a temperature as the water is and it will be all right. You must bring the cream to as low a tem - perature as you can at once after milking. The animal heat must be removed. Keep it in that condition until the next separation and treat it in the fame manner before mixing the two separations. If you will do that from two to three time a week in the summertime and twice in the winter you will have produced a grade of butter you will not be ashamed of nor the State of Nebraska will got be ashamed of. A word about the transportation companies. There was a time when a good deal could be said about the care of cream received during the time it was being transported from the station to the factory. I can aay that from our experience it is getting better all the time. The matter is under control of the state railway commission. If the member here who said he has had trouble would report it to the state railway com - mission he would be doing the proper thing. Mention was made of dirty cans. A few years ago that was quite a factor in the business. To - day the majority of cans in this state are washed. Competition is hand - ling and settling all those matters We cannot go into any town in this state and get business if we have a dirty cream station and if we do not wash and keep clean our cans when our competitor does so. Compe - tition does settle these matters. We are all doing the best we can. We meet here year after year, the creamerymen and the dairymen and dairy operators and discuss these questions and it is with pleasure that we notice the audience here today. I With these few remarks we will close the question of cream ing. Competition will settle all these matters in time. We are g all we can to help the cause to get good cream and a large pro - ion. Grain and alfalfa are the natural products of the farm, subject comes up under the head of the silo and we have in this &gt; at this time some one thousand six hundred fifty silos.

            <seg id="p096">95 ■ Minnesota Experiment Station for twenty-one year*. Mr. Haecker now address you on the subject of "The Summer Silo." Mr. Haecker: I Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: I instated that my name should be on the program of the State Dairymen's Association this year use it has been for fifteen year and I thought it was time to take f. Mr. \V. Righter Wood was to have discussed this subject. He :e me yesterday that he was sick and had not prepared a paper I then solicited Mr. Clark to take his place. He rather consented today informed me it was impossible for him to appear and so It Is o me to speak to you this afternoon on the subject. I have no set paper or speech for you today. I will give you a few suggestions I have picked up in my experience with the silo. The silo business I believe is one of the most important before the dairymen and is being talked of and written about more than any other single farm subject. Why is this true, what is the cause of all this agitation? Is it because some of us are making or building silos, or is it a natural cause? I believe it is the latter. I believe it is a natural cause coming up logically to the man who is keeping stock in this country because it comes as a matter of economy, as a matter of service and farm necessity. The silo is not a new thing. When I was a mere boy we had one on our farm. It was a gocd thing and I have been talking silos to you people here for a good many years. I will admit that the eilo was not as important ten years ago as it is today. You need not ask why because you know. You know that the price of feed has almost doubled during the past few years. You know that land values ussd to be lower, that roughage was more plentiful, that stock was not as numerous and the demand for intensive and economical feeding was not as important as it is today. But with hay at ten or fifteen dollars a ton, corn about one cent per pound, bran at from twenty-two to twenty-three dollars per ton, the man who is feeding his dairy herd is up against a very serious problem. I know this because I have been testing cows and the cost of production is so high that the farmer has not very much profit in what the old cow produces. I maintain that a man cannot afford to milk cows for fun. The producer must have a profit. In regard to the feeder, twenty-five per cent, of the men who fed cattle last year in Nebraska lost money; the per cent, may be great - er than that. The year before it was about the same story. A man wafted into my office last summer and said he lost $1,000 last year feeding steers. I said, "I hope you lose $2,000 this year." "Thank you," he said. That man was feeding just the same way that his father did twenty-five years ago. He now is using a silo and reports a profit in his business. The silo is a necesity on a stock farm under present conditions. A farmer or feeder cannot afford to get along without it. Fifteen years ago I was talking silos. A man said "Oh, that is all ' </seg>
            <seg id="p097">96 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION right for the state but I can't afford it." I said, "You are the man who cannot afford to do without one." I believe the most of the stock feeders in this state know that the silo is a necessity, at least I think they know it. I think that their neighbors, their friends and the men who had the facts and figures who have been proving its worth, have made them believe it. I want to say something here that a great many do not yet believe. I believe the silo will be used for summer feeding quite as much as for winter. This, of course, is some years off but each year will see an increase In the use of the summer silo. My father who has had charge of the dairy division of the Minnesota Dairy Department for the past twenty - one years has been telling me that I should have a silo for summer feeding. I told him that we had plenty of splendid blue grass pasture and that the state was pretty well provided with pasture. It was not until this past year at this station that they have had the summer silo and I am very glad that we tried it because there was no pasture and it proved that it was equally as good and profitable for summer use as for winter. We never had any summer where we produced more milk easier and with less cost than we did this last summer. By the sum - mer silo we are able to feed about six cows on an acre. I think it is not at all difficult to produce twelve tons of good corn fodder on an acre of ground. At this station we have produced from eighteen to twenty tons. I think anywhere in Eastern Nebraska you can produce from ten to fifteen tons which will feed six cows during the summer months. For the past few years it would take about six acres to feed one cow the way she ought to be fed. Here is a thought and a conception of economy of land and land values. The benefit of the summer silo to the dairyman is something astonishing. Cattle suffer in the summer not only from poor pasture but also flies. You all know how cattle will reek shelter, get down into the thicket and there fight the pests. With the silo last year we did not leave cattle out long. Right after dinner we put them in the barn and fed them a good feed of from fifteen ot twenty pounds of corn silage with a little alfalfa hay and they gave a splendid flow all summer. Last summer most dairymen had a fear - ful fight to keep their cows producing enough to supply their demand — in fact many of their cows went dry. With the splendid opportunities we have in this country for producing corn silage at a low cost, splendid corn crop and cane and kaffir corn and milo maize all of which make good silage, and better than that, the alfalfa to balance this silage, it seems to me we have the feeding solution practically solved. The other day I was talking with a man from Illinois and he said to me, "Is it possible for me to obtain some alfalfa hay in your district?" T told him I did not think it would be because it was a rather scarce article. I asked him what he was paying for hay in his section of the country. He said $25 per ton. That is the problem that they have. While we can grow alfalfa hay five and six tons to the acre in this part of the country, the cheap- </seg>
            <seg id="p098">97 f;nown form of protein, and while we can erect a silo and store away save all the feed and secure it in the form of a succulent grass - feed in the cheapest possible form getting carbohydrates in the I practical way and easiest form of digestion, it seems to me that tt it a question for debate. It is a simple question of making the best of what we have. I know there are a good many questions that you would like to ark about the silo and we can devote some time to discussion. One gentleman asked me today — who was considering a silo for the sum - mer, if the silage would keep. I will say to you that silage will keep for several years. I know of a man near Milwaukee who kept corn silage between five and six years and the way he discovered the keeping of silage was this — he was a well-to-do farmer and lived near the city and kept a large dairy herd. He did not put up sufficient silage the drat year so he built another larger silo and filled it. In the spring he had it about half fed out. Having good pasture he turned his cattle out to grass for the summer and in the meantime harvested another crop of corn and went right on and filled his silo and kept doing that for for several years. Tear before last they had a terrible drough in that section of the state and had practically no pasture at all. When spring came half of his silage was gone and there was the old silage in the bottom of the silo which he thought was rotten. When the pasture failed he began digging down to that old silage. He threw off ■d foot or so of black silage, black as mud and very much like mud, but he found underneath splendid silage. He said he really thought his cattle did as well or better on the five or six year old silage than they did on the new. I Another instance is of a man near Chicago who had put up a iber of silos and found that he had more silage than his cattle could mme so he carried over some silage. He watched results very ely and I heard him say in a dairy meeting in Missouri that that : of the silage that was a year old was excellent. Last summer n I was in Minnesota I saw them feeding silage a year and a half not only to dairy cattle but to steers for fattening purposes and I id it to be splendid silage. KSo I say to the man who is fearful of putting up too much lest it Id spoil that he need not have any fears on that ground. It will for several years. When cutting alfalfa if the first cutting spoils we have the con - solation that there are other cuttings. It is possible to cut and put the first crop of alfalfa in the silo and make splendid feed. Q. Do you mean to say that you can put alfalfa in the silo wet? A. Yes. There is a gentleman who lives four miles south of Omaha at the Benton Farm who has been putting alfalfa in his silo for six years and I found out, at least he told me that he often puts it in while it is raining. Q. Did he chop it? </seg>
            <seg id="p099">98 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION A. Yes tir, and packed it in as tight as he could Q. State if alfalfa silage bloaU cattle? A. I have never heard of it bloating cattle. Q. How would you balance that silage? BA. The best balance for that would be corn silage (laughter) like spreading bread on both sides. Q. If you only had one silo how would you do? KA Well, I am suggesting two silos, of course one silo is better no silo at all. Q. Does it hare any ill effect if fed froien? ■ A. I will say that as quick as it is thawed out it should be fei: I prefer not to feed frozen silage to horses. ■ Q. Would you say that as soon as it was thrown down from the that it should be fed directly? A. I don't think feeding it in that way will hurt. I hare never experienced any trouble in feeding frozen silage but I prefer not to feed frozen silage. Q. Can you feed the frozen silage in with other feed? A. You can put it all together. Q. How many cuttings can you put in the eilo? »A. At the Kansas Experiment Station they put the fourth cut - up with corn nixing the two a load of one then a load of the r. It was a sort of '"balanced" silage ration. If you have that don't need to feed anything lese. IQ. Don't you think it is as profitable to put alfalfa in the silo would be to feed it otherwise and use the silo for something else? i the standpoint of economy, so as to have only one silo? A. Well, one silo of course is better than no silo. §Q. Well, from the standpoint of the farmer would not it be r and more economical to fill with corn silage rather than put - the alfalfa into the silo? §A Well, that is a fair question, of course. I don't want to be nderstood as recommending alfalfa above corn silage. I do think corn is the best material for silage. I In regard to silos I would say don't wait too long. Go ahead and a silo because a silo would pay for itself every year. You will lose 0 a year I think by not having a silo. ■ Q. In regard to silage for making condensed milk what would •ay? A. I am glad you brought that up. For several years the Con - densed Milk Companies in different parts of the country conveyed the Idea that condensed milk made from the milk of silage was not good and they prevented their patrons from the use of silos to produce milk for condensed creamery purposes but now I am glad to say they have lifted or removed their ban and they have given their patrons the privilege of building silos and using ensilage for making milk. It is </seg>
            <seg id="p100">99 ■aid that many of their producers got the corn ensilage into the milk instead of into the cow and that gave rise to objection. IQ. Does it make any difference as to the quality of the ensilage her it is cut early or late, which is the better for corn ensilage, ng it green or cutting it a little later? I A. I will say that in our first experience a good many years we would buy our seed corn in Missouri and Arkansas and we got aense cuttings as high as twenty tons to the acre. But as our erience increased we found it better to use corn a little riper. I ik the best way is to use corn when it is well along in the dent and t the dough stage. Corn ensilage is a cheap form of carbohydrate we should produce all we can per acre. In order to get as large eld as possible the corn should be planted thick in the row and put pretty ripe but if it is a little dry it should be thoroughly tamped packed and if the stalks are dry you should add water to prevent ding. ■ Q. In regard to feeding ensilage to horses I understood you to that you didn't recommend feeding frozen ensilage to horses? A. I do not. Q. What objection is there to feeding the frozen ensilage to horses and not to cattle? tA. I cannot tell you the chemical reason why but I know there chemical change in the silage that has been frozen. There has [ some complaint from feeding horses frozen ensilage. I was ing with a gentleman this morning and he said, "I have been feed - my horses frozen ensilage and nice alfalfa hay and they seem to it." I know, however, there has been some trouble experienced i feeding frozen ensilage to horses. Q. Do you know of any trouble of that kind by feeding it to mares and colts? A. I do not. A member: There has been all manner of questions and jokes about the siio and feeding ensilage and of several of which I might mention. One of them said that cows lost their teeth after having used ensilage two years (laughter) and then I have a joke on the State Farm. One fellow says, "You must tramp it pretty well. " "Yes," the other one says, "we put in two or three men to tramp the silage to make it salid, but," he says, "I understand that up at the State Farm they put in two or three horses to tramp it." Then one farmer says that in one neighborhood he had put up four or five silos and one fellow talking about it said that he noticed one had no roof on. "Why has he not put a roof on his silo?" The other man says, "The reason be has not done it he dare not do It for if he put a roof on his silo and filled it up with green feed it would blow up." Now, there comes a whole lot of this kind of talk and questions in regard to the silo and ft has quite a good deal of influence with many of the so-called far - mers as touching the practicability of erecting the silo. </seg>
            <seg id="p101">100 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION* ■ Prof. Heacker: Do you want me to answer the argument about ■ilo blowing up? A. Ye«. »You can fill a silo with corn and without danger seal it up perfectly . The only gas that is produced in corn ensilage is a little heavy there Is not much of it. That gas settles down and does not go up. It is not a combustible gas such as starts a fire. You can fill the silo and let the temperature rise to 100 degrees Fahrenheit and go up on the top of the silo and build a bonfire and you will not do any damage. There is no gas from the silage that is explosive or will burn. The only gas produced Is the gas which is more or less poison - ous when inhaled and will put out fire. That is a point that has been rather detrimental to the underground silo and there has been several experiences of CO2 gas occuring in the pit of the silo. With the ordi - nary silo there is some leakage and it will pass off when the door is opened but with the pit silo there is some danger from CO2 gas accu - mulating at the bottom. In the Breeders Gaxette was a report of one or two cases last MM IQ. A question that I would like to bring up that is not clear in mind is in regard to the feeding of ensilage to my cows. I have one or two parties who have said, and I guess it is all right, that oes not make a real good quality of milk or cream; that the acid fts the cream and consequently you cannot get as good milk or m as you otherwise would. They say the only thing you can do. egard to feeding it, is that if you feed it before milking time that milk will be injured by the effect of the acid and that it should ed after milking. If there are parties here who can answer that ition I would like to hare them do so. A Voice. That must be one case of putting the ensilage in the milk instead of in the cow. The President: Possibly; if it does injure the milk it would be well for us to know that fact. Prof. Haecker: I think the general plan of the dairymen is to feed corn ensilage after milking rather than before. Prof. Fraser with a herd of about twenty cows made a complete and careful test on the quality of the milk and cream made from ensilage fed cows. He carried it out for several years. For example, take a crowd of people like we have here today then pass around to everyone a bottle of milk, one sampled No. 1 and the other sampled No. 2 then take one in each hand and have first one bottle sampled and then the other and have them say which sample they liked the best. The result was in favor of ensilage milk which showed definitely that it could not, or if it could, it did not, even effect the taste or flavor of the milk or cream. Of course, there is some danger of milk taking on odor in the process of milking and for that reason I think most dairymen advise the feed - ing of ensilage after milking. </seg>
            <seg id="p102">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 101 Q. I believe there is something on the stalks of corn called moulds, mouldy corn stalks, this year, that Is poisonous to horses and cattle but more poisonous to horses. I wonder what effect these mould - dy ears or stalks would have when put into the silo, whether they would have to be cut out in order to make safe feed for the cattle or A. I don't know as I could answer that question. I do know that heat destroys most forms of bacteria and the silage goes through a heating process which should destroy most of the moulds. I know also that there develops in silage a certain amount of lactic and acetic acids which are beneficial to the animal and destroy many bacteria. The main reason why corn silage is so wholesome and so beneficial to cattle is because it has this lactic acid. There has never been known any trouble to cattle from corn stalks cut up in this way. We have never known a single case of cattle dying from corn stalk diseases when used in the silo as silage. It is, therefore, fair to assume that the process of making silage destroys this poison. Prof. Webster: One of the real benefits of the silo, I think, has not been mentioned — It may have been mentioned by inference. In Kansas during this past year the forage crop was very short. I consider Nebraska a better corn state than Kansas. And probably you bad more corn to put into the silo this year than we had in Kansas. The silo in Kansas this year has been the Saving Grace of many of the farmers. Farmers have filled their silos this year with catch crops, crops which were planted afterwards. The Indian corn crop was prac - tically a failure. The result was that this catch crop was used by many to fill their silos and it has resulted in the saving of those crops in the most succulent condition, a very desirable condition for feeding. And the farmers who otherwise would have been compelled to sell their stock had plenty of feed. I know of a hundred ton silo that was filled with kaffir corn. It did not mature and he decided to cut it and put it in the silo and he sold it from the silo at $9.00 per ton which was higher than another farmer who sold half his ensilage for $6.00 per ton from the silo, he having had twice as much feed as he required for his stock. Another man's Indian corn crop was practically destroyed by hail. He gathered up what he could of it and put it in his silo. Eighty acres of this kind of corn. There was very little to It besides the stalks, occasionally a nubbin left on the stalk. I had a letter from him afterwards and he said it is not real good feed but he was getting along with it first rate and if he had not put it in the silo he would not have had any feed at all. I was raised on a farm until nearly thirty years of age and know this to be characteristic of farmers — it was characteristic of myself — that we hated to take the chance necessary to the greatest financial success. The business man if he is only worth $2500 will take a $400 or $500 chance. A farmer who is worth from $5000 to $7000 in stock will not take a $500 chance. This gen - tleman right here, did he ever hear of a house in the course of con- </seg>
            <seg id="p103">102 ■truetion blowing down, but people did not stop building houses because one or two buildings blew down. Because one silo blew down in the course of construction is no reason why this man over here or that man over there should hesitate on the silo proposition. If after a ■ilo was built it blew down and rolled over Into the road it is nobody's fault but the man who built it, absolutely. The silo can be anchored. A man will anchor his house in such a way that it will not fall down. Speaking of concrete silos some of these are built but every once in a while one cracks and splits half open and has to be repaired, still some people will continue to build concrete silos. So I say we must take a chance. The silo is not a new thing. Prof. Haecker's father built a silo thirty years ago. That of itself is proof that the silo is a good thing for every man in Nebraska. The President: I regret that we have to interrupt this interesting part of the program right here but time compels us to do so. The next number on our program is "Silos on Large and Small Farms" by Prof. John Bower, but as Mr. Bower is not present with us today I am going to call on Mr. Thos. A. Gierens to give us hie experience about SILOS OX LARGE AND SMALL FARMS. T. A. Gierens tSo much has been said, so much written that I hardly know what y that will interest you — who most any of you with your personal -iences and varied knowledge gained by reading the writings of heads are well informed on the silo and its use on any farm. »As I view this audience I conclude I have before me Nebraska, le — a set of progressive Nebraska farmers — the majority of you ?rs or sons of owners of broad acres of fertile Nebraska land! only owners of land but students of agriculture. Your very presence here indicates you are anxious to know better bow to use these acres for present and future profit. How fortunate, indeed, to be able to own Nebraska land! But this is getting away from my subject, you will bear with me in saying a word for this grand new state, Nebraska. Yes, and her people — all farmers trying to advance in our business, for surely it is a business. And we are making progrect — think what a transformation has taken place here the last twenty years! t! took England two hundred years to increase her wheat yield fourteen to forty-two bushels — we will accomplish this in ten —and the silo is helping us to do it. I A few years ago you could plant these acres to grain and reap amense harvest — But as the ground grew older — weeds increased r bushels grew and at once you began to inquire the cause. You concluded something must be returned to the soil — more </seg>
            <seg id="p104">103 stock must be kept — and the silo has solved the problem not only for winter but summer feed. »I made a trip across Nebraska last October and noticed the hun - s of farms that are sorely in need of more live stock and silos. U led to me not for years had I noticed so little feed for stock, and so cattle to consume feed. § There are a great many farmers in Nebraska that doubt the value silo or the real value of one to them. To such I would say, make arough search for information, then profit by the experience of ■s. Don't wait five years but build at once. The farms of Nebraska, no matter what the acreage must produce more than they are producing under our present management. We hear a great deal about the "Back to the Farm" movement — prefessional men, bankers, merchants and various city people are investing in farm lands and moving on to the farms — but they can't solve the problems of agriculture — you who have lived near the soil alone can do it. It is said our lands at present values return less than 5&lt;* and how shall we double this revenue? I Our farmers are solving the problem. They have found the aver - farmer has too many acres, he has his capital invested in lands should have more in live stock and expend more in labor on the They are buying silos. In 1909 there were only forty silos in Ne - braska, 1910 about four hundred and I heard it said the other day there were now two thousand. Yes, and silos on small farms as well as large I have tried to satisfy myself as to which the silo would serve the better, the large farm or small one. I would say one as well as the other, and that no real farmer in Nebraska today can afford to do without at least one silo and I really believe he should have two, if he farms his large or small farm as he should. II mean to say that every Nebraska farmer should maintain on hia live stock enough to consume all his roughage and corn and "keep the fertility of the soil. Yes, so manage to make his farm more e each succeeding year. ■ In my estimation the man who simply raises corn and wheat and to haul to market is not a farmer. But rather the man who raises a sufficient diversity of the crops best suited to his locality to furnish a rotation and maintain the pro - ductivity of the soil and who does not sell these as raw material, but feeds them on the farm to different kinds of good stock that he has raised himself, is entitled to the honor of being called a farmer — yes, a good farmer. I Some of cur farmers have concluded they can't keep what stock would like to for the reason pastures are uncertain in so many ons of Nebraska. The silo has settled this question beyond a </seg>

II would suggest fellow farmers you build this summer silo — fill it feed those cattle instead of habitually opening the gate and sending e cows into a bare field, only to return tired and hungry at night. I How many of ue do this repeatedly? Yes, and then if this faithful cow don't keep up her milk flow, after consuming her own body onclude "she needs a good selling." I Friends, many of us are really guilty of cruelty to animals the we treat our dumb brutes — and there is no occasion for it, when compafitively low cost we could have had plenty of silage. Again, same pasture if planted to corn, even late would have probably shed the next year's crop of ensilage. Each of you have silos either on your farms or in your neighbor - hood. You know their value in a measure and I would suggest you give their vajue more thought and consideration, satisfy yourself personally as to how you can increase your farm production by the building of one or more. »I find by observation and inquiry that the very beet farmers in raska — owners and operators of large farms have erected silos and using them to profit. The fiord Feeding Company at Central have eight each of two hundred ton capacity, feeding at the pres - ume one thousand head of cattle. tThe Ranking people of Missouri a large number of them on their d acres feeding cattle, hogs and mules for market. Dairymen all Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Nebraska feeding dairy herds nail and large numbers. These are proof gentlemen that the silo 13 od thing. It is one of the most important investments the farmer make. IWe Nebraska farmers are proud of our improvements. No state is Union can boast of more painted buildings than Nebraska — and an air of improvement of thrift that silo will add to your already equipped farm. »Let me repeat don't try to get along another year without that -I can't — and I have used mine for three years — having built when there were only a few in Nebraska. I need another now and build it the coming year. tYou ask what kind? No matter — any good kind. I would not e time and money on a "home-made" one. It would be a failure, Id be short-lived and your silage would likely spoil after you had to the expense of building and filling. The kind of a silo you need nds upon the number of head of live stock you may want to keep you will find very soon that your farm will easily maintain double number you estimate. In fact you double the capacity of your i by simply adding the small cost of the silo. </seg>

One of my neighbors — a good dairyman too, milks about twenty-five cows feeds ensilage and alfalfa, nothing —and only last week our milk company paid him $65 for seven ' milk. THT SILO FOR THE DAIRYMAN. \V. L. Hunter. II am going to give you my own personal experience concerning much discufsed subject, and from it I hope you may be able to e some slight benefit. For the past 15 years I have had much to do with cows, their feeding and care. Beginning with a single family cow, which chanced tc be a good one, the microbes of the cow business spread rapidly through my system, until I became a crank on the subject of the dairy cow, eventually disposing of my business in Lincoln that I might de - vote my whole time to my favorite occupation. Of course, it must be understood that I had to do with pure bred cattle entirely, and I soon found that they responded to extra care and attention. During the years since then I have spent much time and thought in figuring out suitable rations for dairy cows, and have used practically all the con - centrates on the market. This was partly due to the fact that I have practiced testing my cows and was looking for a ration that would bring results, without especially consulting the cost although cheapen - ing the cost of pro-luction was not such a serious problem as confronts the dairyman of today, when feeds are twice and in some instances three times as high as at that time. Twelve years ago I had good alfalfa hay put in my barn at Lincoln for $4 per ton, bran at $10 per ton, oil cake, gluten meal and other high concentrates at $25 or lew per ton, ground corn at 75 cents per 100 pounds, so you see the ques - tion of cheap rations was not so pertinent as at present. Necessarily, there has been an economic revolution along the line of cheapening the cost of production, and the rapid advance in the price of farm lands has been a moving force in bringing about this result. In the manufac - turing world every effort is being made to eliminate waste from what - soever source; in agricultural pursuits we must follow this example, and thus we reach the problem of saving all our corn crop. </seg>
            <seg id="p107">106 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION I In dealing with this question we will consider it from the stand - ot the Nebraska dairyman who can raise his own alfalfa, and with silage is able to feed his stock a balanced ration with pro - i of his own raising. Silos are by no means a new proposition, en years ago, at least, W. M. Clark had a silo on his premises, t» he used for a few years. About twelve years ago S. B. Pierce oodlawn erected a silo in his round barn. This silo was used with 'erent success, one or two seasons the silage spoiling. Mr. Pierce med me it entailed too much hard work and trouble in filling, and extra work in feeding the silage, so he gave It up as a bad job. silo was a board affair, lined with a building or tar paper, and the ruction may have had much to do with ensilage spoiling. While I had read a great deal about silos, I honestly had the Impression that there was not very much to the proposition. It re - mained for my son Paul, who took the course at the school of agri - culture, and who afterwards served there for a year as dairy herdsman, to get me sufficiently interested to put up a silo on my farm. I really knew from what I had read on the subject that it was an economic proposition, but I was like a great many of my neighbors and friemds, who fought against new Ideas, and who have some other of the char - acteristics of their long-eared brethren who have made Missouri famous They like to do things as their fathers did; they get in a rut and stay there until pulled out bodily, and these young fellows who are being turned out by the school of agriculture should have a lot of credit for the work they are doing along that line. I think too much cannot be ■aid of this great school and the work it is doing in Nebraska. In my judgment, Nebraska is destined to become a great dairy state; it has a comparatively mild climate, with plenty of sunshine and a soil that is especially adapted to the growth of corn and alfalfa, the two greatest feeds that can be given a dairy cow. I have said many times that I never have been able to compound a satisfactory ration for cows that did not contain corn in some form, and I may add that it is quite as difficult to get a productive ration without alfalfa, so in these two feeds we have the essentials, at the cost of raising. We have great creameries, and the people of our cities have cultivated a liking for the good things of life, and have thus given us a sweet cream market that is not excelled in the whole country. These are all poten - tial factors in spreading the gospel of dairying. Let the idea soak in, for it is certain the time is coming, if not already here, when men are going to give this great industry proper recognition. The raising of live or six cent beef on these high-priced lands, and higher priced feeds, does not look like easy money any more; and if it is true, and I have the figures to show that it is, that the same feed that will pro - duce a pound of butterfat when fed to a good dairy cow, it looks like a very wide margin in favor of the cow. But to get back to the silo. I am inclined to believe that the stave silo is best adapted to this climate, and I would recommend full- </seg>
            <seg id="p108">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 107 length staves as most desirable, stronger, and less liable to get out of line or blow over. Then get it big enough. Don't be afraid of getting it too large. The initial cost per ton will be considerably less in the large silo, and you will be lucky if you have enough to last you until you have good pasture to take its place, and if you have silage left. it will greatly supplement your feeds later in the season when your pastures are dry. It can be fed to all domestic animals, and even the fowls are fond of it. A year ago Mr. Culver said everything on his place ate it but the hired girl, and I have even noticed my herdsman nibbling at a handful as be was doing the feeding. Do not be afraid of your silage spoiling. Great progress has been made in the con - struction of stave silos, and when properly erected the danger of spott - ing Is practically eliminated. The corn should not be put in too green, or the silage will be too sour; better a little too dry, for in that case water can be added if needed. The filling of the silos can be made a community interest, like threshing, as we did in our neighborhood; thus by the exchange of labor and ideas the filling can be done at a minimum expense. While the past season was perhaps better than the average, we are able to fill six silos with one cutter, and each of these six users are unanimous in praise of the silo. If you are a dairyman and feed in a barn you should study the situation very carefully in locating your silo. Have it convenient, and remember that it all has to be handled. If you have a feeding alley between your cows have a chute drop down as close to this alley as possible. If feeding stock cattle the ordinary bunks used for feeding shelled corn and other grains will answer very well. While dairymen teem to be the most extensive users of ensilage, I candidly believe that the silo will prove just as valuable to the feeder of stock cattle, in cheapening the cost of production and making greater gains. This is the greatest argument in favor of the silo. By reducing the cost of producing butter-fat, you increase the gelling price of your product, and to just that extent enchance your profit. Take, for instance, a herd of 30 cows that will produce 350 pounds of fat to the cow in a year, a total of 10,500 pounds. Experts claim a saving of from four to as high as nine cents per pound where ensilage is fed. I believe you can safely put this saving at five cents per pound, which would mean a saving of over $500 in one year on the product of these 30 cows, or enough to build your silo, pay for an interest in a cutter, and have money left. Then you must consider that your stock will be in a healthier, thriftier condition as a result of feeding ensilage, and that while you have decreased the cost of production, you have at the same time increased the total yield, a double saving in this case. If you are in the milk business that question of keeping up a regular flow, winter and summer, will appeal directly to your pocket, and if selling to creameries it is just as important to secure the maximum yield, and this can be done to best advantage where ensilage is fed. I have not the exact figures, but hundreds of silos were erected in Nebraska the </seg>
            <seg id="p109">108 past year where dozens were in previous years. The beef men are taking bold of this proposition with gratifying results. The Hord Feeding Company, this state, perhaps the largest live stock feeding •establishment in the world, have erected the past year eight 200-ton ■ilos, and are now feeding ensilage with satisfying results. I am con - fident every stock raiser, whether dairyman or feeder, who has as much as 80 acres of land, should have a silo large enough to feed 15 to 20 head of cattle for at least six months of the year. In no other way can the fertility of these high-priced farms be kept up to their present standard better than by the judicious feeding of live stock and the return of the by-product to the land in the form of manure. No ■one who takes the experience of others as a guide can afford to do with - out a silo, and as we get more silos, and a larger number become in - terested in growing a suitable corn for ensilage, the labor and difficul - ty of filling the silos will be minimized. Ten years ago there were comparltively few cream separators in the state, today there is one on almost every farm where cows are kept. The farmers simply found out that It paid and paid big, to own and use a separator. It is the same with the silo, and as a matter of fact there is a much larger com - parative gain than in the use of the separator, for in the case of tho silo you use to great advantage a product that goes largely to waste. Then the feeding of ensilage tends to better care of live stock than in turning out in all kinds of weather to fight "snow-balls" with a three - wire fence their only protection. It does not pay to get careless with a dairy cow, turning her out to her own devices with mercury hunting the lower bulb, and a Yukon zephyr sweeping down from Broken Bow, and then expect a fat cream check when the returns get in. In this connection I am reminded of what an old Swede neighbor of mine said once when he got hold of the hot end of the poker in a little deal in Bast Lincoln. "Hunter," he says, "when you expect to get something for noding, by golly, you get noding." And this is particularly appli - cable to the feeding and care of dairy cows, as they will prove a ver - itable gold mine on any Nebraska farm when given the proper at - tention. But given indifferent care and turned out In all weather to rustle for themselves they are maintained on far too many farms at a loss and become, instead of an asset, and actual liability to the owner. I cannot put the care and feeding of dairy cows in too strong language, for in no occupation will you get as certain returns as in the proper management of dairy cows. (In conclusion I would advise every dairyman to erect a silo large gh for his present and future needs, provide plenty of alfalfa for lemental feed, and then he can crack his fingers at the mill-trust i ground feeds get too high to feed at a profit. Then if he will out his poor cows by the use of the scales and the Babcock test, i dairy sire of strong dairy heredity at the head of his herd he have little cause to complain of his lot, or desire to change his nation. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">109 tThe President: We have a representative of the department of ulture, dairy division, Washington, who will give us a little talk his point of view. Mr. A. K. Risser: Mr. President and Gentlemen: Tour interest in the subject of the silo reminds me of the interest expressed yesterday at the Colorado dairymen's convention at Denver. The subject that took up more time than any other was the silo and the feeding of ensilage. The first week in January I attended the Idaho meeting and the same thing was true there in that association. People that have silos are very enthusiastic concerning them. Their attitude towards the silo reminds me somewhat of the story told of a traveling man. He was a traveling man who got on a train at a station as traveling men sometimes do. He got on the train, walked up to the middle of the coach, turned over one seat to face the other and sat down and in that way occupied two with no room left for another per - son except the unoccupied seat. A drunken man got on the train as they sometimes do. He came up to the traveling man who was occupy - ing or trying to occupy two seats. He says to the traveling man, "Hay I have this seat?" The traveling man paid no attention to him but he insisted upon having the traveling man's attention and whea he got it the traveling man said, "You are drunk." The drunken man ■aid. "I know I am drunk and I know I will get over that but you are a hog and you will never get over being a hog. (laughter) I am a little afraid you are In that condition, that you will not get over this enthusiasm concerning the silo. I will say a few words that will bear on the other side of the question. There may be some farmers who are just about on the point of building a silo. I would say by all means do it, but don't build that silo thinking It is a cure - all. There are other things you will have to do besides building a silo to make your business profitable. I have had lots of experience in building silos and in getting men to build their first silo and in getting them started feeding ensilage. I have been dissapointed in the results and the encouragement I received from those men because they ex - pected the silo to do too much. The silo Is an excellent thing but it is not a cure-all. It is one of the means of advance to better farming and better dairying . So I merely want to round out what has been said and make it a complete discussion. Go home and build that silo but don't expect it to do what is impossible. It can't make first grade cream out of that dirty operation on your farm. It will make those poor cows to become better cows but it won't do the other thing too. I believe our unprofitable dairying aside from the poor cow is due to our poor feeding, and the silo is an aid to better feeding. The silo will not put anything into your corn crop. In fact silage is not quite as good a thing as a good grain or corn crop. There is a loss of from ■even to thirteen percent. In the cron crop put into the silo. What are you Nebraska farmers doing with your corn crop growing out In </seg>
            <seg id="p111">110 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION the fields? There is a loss anywhere in the best cured fodder from twenty-one to twenty-five per cent, up to sixty per cent. The Western Nebraska farmer, the Western Kansas farmer and the Eastern Colo - rado fanner grow considerable corn; and if you go through that country you will find the Russian thistle and the corn leaves, the nu - tritious part of the corn crop going to waste. Sixty per cent, is lost in that country. KThe silo instead of making that necessary saves practically all of In other words, you grow about 18 acres to get 12 acres of corn to feed to the animal in addition to the crop in a condition that loroughly relished and palatable. It is a feed for stimulating the lal and getting it in good condition. Being out canvassing territory for a cow testing association near Scribner in Eastern Colorado an old dairy district, we asked one of the men how his cows were doing, how he was getting along. He said he had the best year he ever had. That his herd went through the winter without the loss of a single head. He said it in a manner that called for congratulation. The thing we want to have is better dairy - men to bring our herds through the year without the loss of a single head and without the loss of a single pound of butterfat. Gentlemen, I thank you. (Applause) The President: We have as our guests today some of the most distinguished educators along dairy lines. There is the Hon. T. A. Borman, President of the Continental Creamery Company at Topeka and Editor of the Kansas Farmer, which we love to read; Dean Web - ster of the Kansas- Agricultural College; Prof. McKay and the Hon.

Next in order will be the report of the committee resolutions. Prof. Frandsen. Mr. President I submit the following resolu - tions for the approval of this association: RESOLtTIOXS. Resolved, That, Whereas the present dairy building at the agri - cultural college is far too small for the needs demanded of tt by the growth of the department making it exceedingly difficult to accomo - date the large number of students requiring instruction in this divi - sion, the dairymen's association request the members of the board of regents to ask our legislature for an appropriation to build a perma - nent and suitable building to house the department. I Tour committee wishes to call attention to the fact that the ent dairy building has been constructed piece-meal, and is not ft for the work that it is compelled to house; that the building many year* was used as a school building when practically all he agricultural work was carried on within Its walls, and we )ve that the building has served its purpose wonderfully well, the state can now well afford to replace it with a building that represent this great industry and be a credit to the state. 1 Whereas, The resignation of A. L. Haecker, as professor of dairy indry in our state university has recently been accepted by the 1 of regents; therefore, be it t Resolved. That we, the members of the Nebraska Dairy men '3 :iation, do hereby express our great appreciation of Professor ker's services to the dairy interests of Nebraska and adjoining Whereas, The resignation of H. R. Smith, professor of animal husbandry in our state university has been accepted by the board of regents, therefore be it Resolved, That we, the members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association, hereby express our great appreciation of the eminent services of Professor H. R. Smith to the live stock and agricultural Interests of not only our own state, but of adjoining states; and we regret exceedingly that Prof. Smith deemed it best to thus sever his connection with our university, believing it to be a distinct loss both to the university and the people of our state. I Resolved, That we send greetings and kindly remembrances to J. B. Dinsmore, one of the charter members of our association the wish that he may be restored to health, and may enjoy many 1 of usefulness and happiness. </seg>

Committee — J. H. Frandsen, A. E. Wllkeson, A. L. Haecker On motion the resolutions as reported by the committee were adopted. i President Rector: Before we part today, I would like to say to gentlemen, that I appreciate very much, the co-operation of all 1 of you during the past year, especially, during the last three of our meeting here. tl think our minutes will show, that the meeting now closing, has the best ever held, in the way of attendance, enthusiasm anl thing that would count for the up-building of our industry in state among the dairymen and creamerymen, and all those in - ted in this cause. II have for more than twenty years, attended these meetings, and grown up in the business with the rest of you. Twenty years I was operating a small creamery at the town of Tobias in this ', where we used to go out and get the cream on routes and haul to the creamery in tanks, and make what we then called, "good it" out of It. From that time until now, I have been engaged in manufacture of this good butter in this state. tl am proud to have been your president for the past year, and t3 »ss at this time, the very interesting results of the evolution of the itry in this state. When we first began to journey here to Lin - each winter, there were only a few of us that would get together in the old dairy building. I was there when we dedicated it, but at time, our students of agriculture were conspiciously absent. Just a word now to the agricultural students, who have helped us at this meeting to make it such a success. In my ludgment, there is nothing that will do so much for the upbuilding for this associa - tion and for our state, and the business in which we are all engaged, whether it be breeding dairy cattle, producing cream and milk, or manufacturing butter, as all these students are going to do. I want </seg>
            <seg id="p114">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 113 ■ boys to know thaf the association appreciates what you have done us at this convention. II also want to thank you personally and to take this opportunity ay to you, that the corporation in which I am now connected business way. The Fairmont Creamery Company of Omaha, is t in need of young men, and I wish to take advantage of this occa - to invite the students of this university, and the dairy students articular, to make us a visit at least once a year. The next time come to Omaha, we invite you to come to our factory and we will leased to show you what we have been talking about. We want low you something of the evolution of the business. Our company employs in Omaha, upwards of two hundred and fifty people. We employ at our Grand Island plant, one hundred and twenty-flve, we employ at- our Crete plant, over two hundred people the year around. At this time, we have one thousand agents buying cream and produce over the producing sections in which we operate. These agents are afl licensed by the state in which they do business. W»- are also operating branch sales and distributing houses over all the United States, and our object in making these statements to you today, is to show you that we have a place for, and can use, all the students that this university can turn out for some years to come, in our business alone, and we will be pleased indeed to receive and consider applications for positions from you boys. We want in our business, young men who have prepared themselves for the future posibllities of this industry. In making this invitation and saying what I do, I also want to add that I have two boys of my own growing up. One boy is now in the Dartmouth college in Hanover. New Hamp - shire, and the other will graduate from the Omaha high school this year and will enter Dartmouth next year. After they graduate there. I hope they will come here and take a post-graduate course in scien - tific agriculture and dairying. tNext year when we meet again, I hope to see, instead of two red and fifty students in these seats, five hundred or more. In we hop* the audience will be so large next year that the regents have to provide a larger building to accomodate us. IThe officers you have elected for the ensuing year are men who interested in and have something to do with each department of association. This will insure another year of marked improv* - t all along the line. tXow I find it is getting late, but I believe It would be appreciated le audience, of the president elect would say a few words to us i is time, and It is with pleasure that I now introduce to you, president for the ensuing year, Mr. Chas. F. Schwager, and hand m the gavel of tnt associatttn. </seg>
            <seg id="p115">114 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Mr. Schwager Mr. President and Gentlemen tl assure you I appreciate the honor you have bestowed upon me I promise to give the work the necessary time it requires. Any I that I can do for the benefit of the association I want you to on me. Our president made a remark that takes me back to the time when I first attended these meetings some thirteen years ago before we had any agriculture class and before we had any building here at all. The agriculture and dairy meetings were held in the old university chapel and I remember going to the register and asking if I could be excused to attend these meetings. She looked at me in a dubious way as much as to say she didn't know whether it would be proper or not — I attended the meetings. That year we had seven students in the agriculture class and we came out here two or three times a week to judge cattle. The next year whem we came out we had a small building with about thirty students; and from that time on the attendance and the school has increased most rapidly. Bo I feel quite at home when I come to Lincoln and I trust that I shall serve the association satisfactorily to all. ■ If there is no further business to call before this convention I now declare it closed.

The ten cows used in this contest were all of the Holstein breed and were officially placed by an expert Judge. The cows were without official records as re - gards milk and butter production. Each cow was given a letter and the letter pasted upon the cow's back. A perfect score, that u placing the cows as did the expert, counted 100 points and in order to secure any pro rata share of the premium money the contestant must make a score of seventy-five points, which counted as one point in the pro rata distribution of the 1200 in premium money offered: a score of 76 points counted two points in the pro rata distribution.

O&gt;\V TESTING ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE REPORT. Your committee on cow testing association work. After careful consideration of the possible expense and the results to be expecteJ from work of this kind, do unanimously recommend that this be again taken up. tWe further recommend that the Nebraska State Dairy Assocla - contribute as much money as the directors of the association feel fled in contributing to help defray the expense of starting this ; and each member of the organized cow testing association be d to pay the sum of one dollar for each cow entered in the test, that while our funds are limited we urge that no herd of less than teen cows be admitted to test unless its owner pays at least teen Dollars a year for said testing. We suggest the adoption of the following form of contract for the cow testing association: </seg>
            <seg id="p120">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 119 COW TESTING ASSOCIATION CONTRACT. Whereas, the testing associa- tion has been organised for the principal purpose of providing means for the co-operation of its members in ascertaining the relative merits of their cows, and in the economical production of dairy products; and Whereas, the association agrees, from monthly tests made by an employe of the association, to furnish each member with a record of the individual performance of each animal subscribed; and to advise the members in regard to economical feeding and the Improvement of their herds; and Whereas, I , am desirous of becom- ■ a member of said association, for the objects above stated; Now Therefore, in consideration of my admission to membership and the services above mentioned, I agree and promise to pay to the treasurer of the testing association the sum of one dollar ($1) for one year's record for each of my cows so tested, to-wit; $ for the periodical testing of cows, and I agree to make payment for such testing in quarterly installments in advance. said payments to be due and payable on the first day of.. and , and I agree to take or send the money to the treasurer of the association without being called on therefor. And I agree to furnish board and lodging for the expert employed as tester by said association for at least one day each month and over Sunday if his regular course brings him to my house on Saturday; and to convey him to his next place of work. And I further agree to pay 25c annual dues for the miscellan- eous expense of said association, at the beginning of my membership, &gt;to be subject to the by-laws of the association. The term of this agreement shall be one year. Witnesses: (date) 1911. In our opinion a committee of three with full power to act for this association should be appointed to assist and to co-operate with the University dairy department in the work it is doing along this Respectfully submitted: J. H. FRANDSEN, E. M. LITTLE, E. W. PR08T. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">120 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION IProf. Fraadsen: We also recommend that the Nebraska Dairy - s Association contribute such sum as in the wisdom of its officers iv see fit and I desire this in the form of a resolution. Mr. Rector Mr. President: I have an idea concerning this testing association that might possibly be brought about through the aid of our MM inspectors largely. Of course, it opens up quite a subject that is not necessary at this time to elaborate on but we have here in this state a law governing the creamery business and the licensing of operators in the state before they are permitted to test cream and we have some 2680 licenses issued to operators who have the right to test milk and cream. They are the only people in the state who hare any right legally to make a test of cream and milk. These licensed testers each pay $1.00 and each creamery association in the state con - tributes so much per year according to the amount of butter the/ manufacture, to the support of this department. Now, why are we not entitled to ask of this department the aid of these testers for the education of the farmers in each community where these creameri&lt;?s are organized? We have I think it is, four inspectors paid by the btate who are on the road the year round and we have eight the larger part of the year. What is more important to the state than this work? How could those boys do the farmers of this state any more good or this industry any more good than to help in some way either directly or indirectly in regard to the care of cream and this scheme of cow testing association? We haver already contributed this to the up-keep of this department. We could use the money that comes from this part of the dairy business, that the cream and station operators con - tribute and it seems to me it might be used to advantage at this time. Speaking firstly, and not for any of the creameries in the state our company would be glad to co-operate with any movement that might be made along this line. We will do our part as we have always tried to do and will be glad to contribute any reasonable amount or do any - thing possible that we can do to establish these testing associations, or in any way advance the best interests of the state. At this time 1 am quite sure we have no authority to bind the dairymen's associa - tion to contribute any amount. There is no question but what the movement is an important one and I believe we should take some action to get something started. Mr. Frandsen: In regard to Mr. Rector's plan these licensed tetters have not the qualifications they ought to have and which I hope they will have. I hardly believe those testers now have the power to do that work. But I believe there should be' some way by which some - thing could be worked out, and I would like to see the work continued. Mr. Rector. Replying to Mr. Frandsen I might say that there was a time when there was a little suspicion on the part of our farmers towards station operators as to their ability to test but that I believe has largely been eliminated especially within the past two or three </seg>
            <seg id="p122">TWENTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 121 years since the law took hold of it and settled the proposition once (or all. The law has made our operators licensed people and they are controlled and governed by the law of the state. What I have reference to more than anything else is the benefit we could get from these In - spectors. You cannot put anybody out to conduct a cow testing asso - ciation. You must first pass an examination and secure a liscense We have our Inspectors on the road and they are now before farmer* institutes doing educational work. Let us start this movement with the policy of getting all the good we can from the state through these inspectors and I am in favor of getting as much help from them as we can. We have contributed for the maintenance of that department and are certainly entitled to all the assistance that may be obtained from them. Mr. Harnly: For your information it aeems to me you must have a man who understands the proposition of testing. It Is the duty and policy of the department to do anything along the line of education that we can and that is what we are doing. We are glad to co-operate wltfi anyone. I am today engaged in looking up a point for some dairyman, some question that was asked here during this meeting, and in every way possible we are at all times willing to do what he can. We believe It is our duty to encourage in every community the local station operator in the matter of testing. For us to take up the work of the station operators in testing cream and the cow testing associa - tion I think it is not feasible. When the work of the dairy eommision - er was started the work covered a few points and as the appropria - tion increased and the occasion demanded our work has been extended. What Mr. Rector has said is probably true that the money goes into the general fund of the state, but it does not go into our pockets. It is a part of the state funds. We have a certain amount contributed to carry on our work. Mr. Culver: I move that we adopt these resolutions and that the committee be continued for further duty. Resolutions adopted.

I Mr. Hunt of Hastings was then called upon for his views in regard le butterfat standard in ice cream. Mr. Hunt stated that in his ion the standard is too high and advocated a change to either a x standard or no standard, as soon as a change could be made ugh the legislature, if such a change could be brought aboiu. Hunt stated that other states in the East had lower standards and » states no standard at all, and that these same states were doing eater ice cream business than the states in which the high standard ailed. Mr. Dodds supported Mr. Hunt's remarks supplementing — the same by saying that he did not believe that the reputable manufacturer would regularly manufacture, ice cream without sufficient butterfat to insure its wholesomeness. An opportunity was given for others to join in the discussion and several other members presented their views. C. C. Collins explained how difficult it is to be able at all times to procure the butterfat necessary to comply with the law, especially at such times as pastures were beginning to dry up and the demand for ice cream was still heavy. The president then announced that the newly appointed Food, Dairy and Drug Commissioner, Mr. N. P. Hansen being present, would be asked to make remarks. Mr. Hansen responded by saying that, having held the office but a few days, the work was new to him but that he fully intended to uphold the law in every respect, and hoped that he might have the assistance of every member of the association. »Mr. Hansen asked that each member of the association assist him suing a full list of the manufacturers, wholesale and retail in aska, in order that they might be called upon to pay the license which is imposed up on manufacturers. I Chemist Redfern of the dairy commissioners office was asked to e a few remarks. He spoke at length upon the duties of the dairy missionere and explained how hard it was at times to secure in - tors who were able to carry out the requirements of the pure food and still not antagonise the manufacturers. A few instances were tioned where inspectors and manufacturers misunderstood one her, much to the discomfiture of the department and to the manu - irer. He hoped that with larger appropriations, less trouble of nature would exist. It was moved and seconded that a committee be appointed to col - lect data in regard to the butterfat standard existing in other state* </seg>

The committee were as follows: H. PISHBACK, Chairman. \V. R. LEIGHTON G. R. DODDS Erhe former dairy commissioner, S. L. Mains was present and in - to make a few remarks. Mr. Main responded in hie usual I way. He expressed his satisfaction at seeing the advancement by the association since its organization at which time he was rter member. The matter of collections the next topic, was then taken up Mr. Pishback was asked to present his views; and he suggested that all the delinquent accounts on manufacturers ledgers be for - warded to the secretary and this list be sent to each member of the association, thereby, helping the manufacturer to guard against poor accounts. It was moved and seconded that auch a list be sent to the secre - tary, as explained above. It was the opinion of those present that considerable assistance had been given to the members of the association by manufacturers refusing to ship to other manufacturer's customers who were in ar - rears, and that If the same practice be followed, good results would be obtained. K Motion was then made that the secretary furnish each member a list of the wholesale and retail manufacturers of ice cream: in case that any manufacturer had been omitted, the name should ;nt either to the secretary or to the Food, Dairy and Drug Corn - loners. Mr. Downey of the Downey-Turnquist Co., Chicago, 111., Mr. Bovie. of the Creamery Pkg. Mfg. Co., Omaha, Neb., and Mr. Timitch of the Timitch Cone Manufacturing Co., Lincoln, Neb., were in turn invited to address the meeting along any line they might, choose. These gentlemen each responded in a very interesting way. Those applying for membership were as follows P. J. Steifer, Geneva, Nebr Lexington Co-operative Cry Co., Lexington, Nebr. Ruckles Bros.. Dreshler, Nebr. Twin City Separator Co., Minneapolis, Minn IOn motion duly seconded and carried, It was agreed to ballot the applications as one; and there being no objection or dis - on, the foregoing were elected members of the association. A committee composed of Robt. Dickey, W. R.
