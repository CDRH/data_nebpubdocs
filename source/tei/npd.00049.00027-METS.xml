Nev DEPARTMENT OF DAIRY HUSBANDRY Because of his influence in stamping desirable character - istics on his offspring, it is of the greatest importance that an efficient dairy sire be selected. Unfortunately it is not an easy task to select a dairy bull having the ability to transmit tendencies for increased milk production. The real worth of a sire for the dairy herd can be estab - lished only when production records of the progeny are avail - able for comparison with those of the preceding generation. A study of the following three sires which have been in service in the University of Nebraska dairy herd should be of interest to the Nebraska dairyman wishing to improve his own herd. This experiment indicates that the apparently high cost of a good herd sire is more than outweighed by the increase in the value of the progeny. All records were made in the dairy herd of the Uni - versity and the feeding, care and management were essen - tially the same for the dams as for the daughters. In every case the records given in the tables are for a period not ex - ceeding 365 days in length, even tho the lactation period ex - tended beyond that time. The ages given are the ages of the cows at the beginning of the lactation period. PUREBRED SIRES EFFECT GREAT IMPROVEMENT The purebred Jersey bull Golden Shylock has had a re - markable influence in improving the Jersey herd due to the ability of his daughters to raise the general average of the herd in milk and butterfat production. This bull was pur - chased in the fall of 1908 when a little over a year of age. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION CIRCULAR 8 4 He remained in the herd until his death in August, 191G. Twelve of his daughters from eight different dams have com - pleted records for one lactation period and nine have com - pleted two or more lactation periods. A comparison of the production of the daughters of this sire with that of their dams reveals the truly wonderful power which he possessed of transmitting to his offspring FIG. 1. FIVE DAUGHTERS OF GOLDEN SHYLOCK From left to right: Lucy. Ula. Esther, Glimmer, Reba. Table 1 shows their average production over that of their dams in their first lactation period to be 42 per cent. milk and fat producing ability. As shown in Table 1, the average increase in production of the daughters over that of their dams during the first lactation period was 42 per cent in the case of both milk and butterfat. This increase is very great considering the fact that the dams were good producers, their average fat production being more than twice that of the average cow of Nebraska according to the 1910 census reports. As the production of the herd increases it continually becomes more difficult to effect marked im - provement. With but a single exception the production of both milk and fat by each of the twelve daughters of this sire was greater during the first lactation period than that of their dams, as shown in Table 4. In the case of the cow </seg>
            <seg id="p005">PUREBRED SIRES EFFECT HERD IMPROVEMENT Glory, there was a decrease of about 1 per cent in milk pro - duction, but her fat production showed a slight increase. In the second lactation period, three of the daughters failed to produce quite as much butterfat as their dams and two of these were considerably lower in milk production than their dams. The average of all the daughters, however, was con - siderably greater. The purebred Holstein-Friesian bull Prince Ormsby Mer - cedes DeKol was purchased in January, 1911, being nearly 4 years old at that time. He was retained in the herd a little FIG. 2.

But three purebred daughters of this bull were raised in the herd. All of these showed very marked improvement in production over that of their dams in spite of the fact that two of the dams are among the highest record cows ever owned in the University Dairy herd. Ka,ty Gerben, the dam of Kittie, at 6 years of age produced 19,161.2 pounds of milk containing 665.14 pounds of fat in one year. LaMay, the dam of LaVerna, holds the largest record of any cow in the herd, namely, 26,660.3 pounds of milk and 773.49 pounds of fat. </seg>

            <seg id="p007">PUREBRED SIRES EFFECT HERD IMPROVEMENT 7 Considering the average improvement of the three daughters over their dams, it was found that in the first lactation period their milk production was 66 per cent, and their fat production 99 per cent greater. (Table 2.) In the second lactation period, there was not such a striking in - crease, the milk yield being 22 per cent and the fat yield 69 FIG. 3. PRINCE ORMSBY MERCEDES DEKOL This Holstein sire left but a few daughters in the herd, but all of these are excellent examples of the power of a prepotent sire to transmit to his daughters tendencies for in - creased production. per cent greater than that of the dams. In other words the excess production of the three daughters over that of th a ir dams during the first lactation period was 16,872.5 pounds of milk containing 787 pounds of fat, and in the second lac - tation period 9,068.2 pounds of milk containing 552.2 pounds of fat. The daughters, however, had an advantage over their dams in bring older at the time of freshening, thus giving them greater size and capacity. While the records of but three daughters form but a small number for comparison and for definite conclusions as to the outstanding ability of this sire to effect marked improve - ment under varying conditions, the increases shown are truly remarkable when the high levels of production attained by his daughters are considered. The average production of the daughters during their first lactation periods was 14,190.1 </seg>

Th. records of these cows place them among the superior pro ducers of the breed. King Segis Hengerveld Vale followed Prince Ormsb: Mercedes DeKol as herd sire for the Holstein herd, beinj purchased July 13, 1912. Six of his daughters have complete( FIG. 4. DAUGHTERS OF PRINCE ORMSBY MERCEDES DEKOL From left to right : AUie, Kittie, and LaVerna. The first two have completed 365-day records during their third lactation periods of 692.69 pounds and 733. 0* pounds of butterfat. respectively. records for one lactation period or more. In the case of foui of these very substantial increases in production over thai of their dams is noted. (Table 6.) In the case of two, th&lt; production :s not greatly different from that of their dams. Considering the average of the six it was found that their production exceeded that of their dams 45 per cent in milk and 42 per cent in fat production, corresponding closely tc the increases shown by the daughters of Golden Shylock during their first lactation period. The average production of the dams of these daughters was greater than in the case of the dams of the daughters of Prince Ormsby Mercedes DeKol, so that the opportunity for a large increase was not quite so great. One of the dams whose record is given in Table 3, is Allie, which appears in Table 5 as a daughter of Prince Ormsby Mercedes DeKol. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">PUREBRED SIRES EFFECT HERD IMPROVEMENT FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS It may be of interest to state the increased production of the daughters over their dams in terms of its money value. During the calendar year 1918 the average price paid in Lincoln for butterfat in cream used for buttermaking pur - poses was 50.73 cents per pound. During the period of Sep - tember, 1918, to May, 1919, inclusive, the price paid in Lin - coln to producers for whole milk testing 4 per cent fat was $3.48 per hundred pounds. On this price basis the butterfat produced by the twelve daughters of Golden Shylock during the two years would have been worth $1,246.14 more than that produced by their dams. If the product had been marketed as whole milk it would have brought a return of $2,137.07 more than the milk of their dams. The three daughters of Prince Ormsby Mercedes DeKol for the two years increased the butterfat production over that of their dams to the amount of $703.37. The increase in the value of their milk at the rate of $3.22 per hundredweight for milk testing 3.7 per cent fat would have totaled $1,169.02, or, in other words, considering the average production of the three daughters, it is found that the butterfat produced each year by each daughter was worth $117.23 more than that of her dam and the milk produced exceeded that of her dam by $194.83. These amounts are greater than the total value of the butterfat or the milk produced by the average cow of Nebraska. The six daughters of King Segis Hengerveld Vale in the same period would have returned in increased production over their dams $759.15 worth of butterfat or $1,298.47 worth of milk, an average of from $67 to $108 per cow per year. In contrast to the above conditions, Farmers' Bulletin No. 993 of the United States Department of Agriculture gives an example of a scrub bull whose daughters failed to produce as much as their dams, their average production being about 13 per cent less than that of their dams. If this scrub sire had been used instead of Golden Shylock the decreased pro - duction of the daughters would have caused a butterfat loss of $379.65, or a milk loss of $449.09, in the two years. Thus the difference between this scrub sire and Golden Shylock re - presents a money value of $1,625.89 from the sale of butterfat of twelve daughters, or $2,786.16 from the sale of their milk. </seg>

            <seg id="p011">PUREBRED SIRES EFFECT HERD IMPROVEMENT 11 The use of this scrub sire instead of Prince Ormsby Mercedes DeKol would have decreased the butterfat produc - tion of the three daughters by the amount of $140.11, a dif - ference of $843.48 between the two bulls. In milk production the decrease amounts to $238.88, a difference of $1,407.90. In the case of King Segis Hengerveld Vale the scrub sire would have decreased the returns from the six daughters below that of their dams by the amount of $240.88 in butter- FIG. 5. KING SEGIS HENGERVELD VALE Two daughters of this sire showed a 100 per cent increase of milk and butterfat over their dames. fat or $410.51 in milk production. The difference in favor of King Segis Hengerveld Vale is $1,003.10 thru the butter - fat production or $1,708.98 thru the milk production of his six daughters. The above computations should offset any arguments in favor of a cheap bull even for a smalt herd of cows. The re - turns from the three daughters of Prince Ormsby Mercedes DeKol would have justified an investment of $500 in his case and still have left a profit of $669.02, whereas, with a scrub sire there would have been a loss of $238.88, besides his pur - chase price. It can readily be seen from the foregoing discussion that in herds of such size that six or more heifers can be raised each year one could afford to invest a large amount in a purebred sire if sires having similar ability could be </seg>

Assuming that the sire remains in the herd two years and effects an improvement in each of his daughters to the value of from $50 to $100 for each year that she produces milk, an investment of $600 in the sire would be profitable. This does not take into consideration the value of the sire at the time of his disposal from the herd, which is sometimes greater than his purchase price. Golden Shylock was purchased at a cost of $200 and died while a member of the herd. The price paid for Prince Ormsby was $150 and he was sold about one year later for the sum of $175. Of course, at that time his real worth was not at all realized, or doubtless FIG. 6. QUALLA LINCOLN AND CALF This cow U one of the best daughters of King Sepris Hengerveld Vale. efforts would have been made to retain him for a longer period. The immediate reason for his sale was his ugly disposition and the difficulty of handling him on account of his tearing the ring from his nose. King Segis was bought for $500 and was sold at the end of his term of service in the herd for $280. The net cost of the three sires was therefore $420. This is but a very small </seg>
            <seg id="p013">PUREBRED SIRES EFFECT HERD IMPROVEMENT 13 proportion of the value of the improvement which they effected in the herd from the standpoint of milk and butterfat. Another phase of the question is the value of the off - spring. The fact that the daughters of these sires were able to make such good records naturally raised their money value above that of their dams, and better prices were also secured for the male calves sold. The good qualities which these sires were able to transmit to their daughters did not cease in their good effects in that generation but the tendency for high production was transmitted in some degree to several succeeding generations also. HOW TO SELECT A PREPOTENT SIRE The task of selecting a sire which will transmit to his offspring tendencies for high milk and fat production is not in easy one. The only certain method of determining whether i sire possesses this power is to compare the records of his laughters with those of their dams as has been done in this aaper. This, of course, precludes the possibility of making such a comparison until the daughters have completed one actation period which means that the sire will be at least "our years old at that time. Practically the only means available for judging the pre - &gt;otency of a sire before his daughters freshen is his pedigree. Since investigations indicate that tendencies for high milk pro - luction are transmitted by the sire to his daughters and by he dam thru her sons, some of the points which should be onsidered in the study of a pedigree of a young bull are: First, his dam. Does she have high records of milk ind butterfat production ? Do her daughters have high records .nd have her other sons produced daughters which have high ecords? Has her sire proved to be a producer of uniformly rood stock? Have her other ancestors been uniformly good &gt;roducers of milk and stock? Second, his sire. Do his daughters have high records of nilk and butterfat production ? Have his other sons produced •ood stock? Has his dam good records as outlined above? lave his other ancestors good production records? A study of the pedigree of Prince Ormsby Mercedes De - [ol reveals the fact that it meets practically all of the require - aents outlined above. The pedigrees of the other two herd tires exhibit similar qualities. </seg>
