Experiments at College Farm 

&lt; 

1882. 

Gentlemen of tije Board of Regents : 

Accordi»g-to your instructions, I present a report of the operations 
of the Industrial College for the year ending December 1st, 
1882: 

The proper work of this College may lie divided into three 
somewhat distinct parts : (1) Instruction, (2) General Farming, 
and (3) Experimentation. The first named is, of course, the 
leading one. The second is made a necessity by the nature of 
the instruction given. You cannot teach agriculture and horticulture 
without means of illustration and study, and these means 

leeded in general farming, viz : a farm, stock, 
irds, vineyards, etc. These things are procured

add our share to the work of improvement in the art of farming, 
which ought to go on constantly in every civilized community. 

For the sake of clearness these three kinds of work are discussed 

ik« 

separately in this report. In our accounts each, as far as possible, 


¦ought, but not at the expense of instruction. The third kind of 
work, experimentation, is partly for instruction, in the hope of 

developing in the students a taste for such work, and partly to </seg>

INSTRICTION 

This is divided into two lines, Agriculture — including Hort 

culture — and Civil Engineering. The new course of study 

adopted, in July last is now in use. and M6flM to be an improve- 

ment on the previous one. The principal changes were bringin 

t' ¦ practical studies farther forward in the course, and adding one 

\. ar to it, SO as to give to it the same length and difficulty as tlu 

other University courses. In tome agricultural schools it is t\ 

practice to give the students several years of scientific and literary 

studies before the special agricultural studies are introduced 

W« have ventured to reverse this order, by putting the purely 

ical studies early in the eoane, leaving the sciences to a 

time, when they are used a~ a means of explaining and 

justifying the instruction given earlier. One important incidents 

advantage arise! trotn this course; however short the time a 

lent may remain in the school, he is certaiu to have soni 

instruction in the practical arts and principle! of iarmii 
To illustrate this general statement by an example ; 

tor ii a student is in the college, he pursues the study of practici

airricalture, which includes such instruction about farm 

one ignorant of, or but partially acquainted with tb 

get from a skilled, intelligent fanner. The student reads and 

discusses such topics as the following: The pur| 

v 

ti&lt;m. plowing, harrowing and rolling the soil. The history 

habits, varieties and modes of cultivating all ordinary far 

l 

Forage crops, special kinds and adaptations. Ensilage. Mixed 

as compared with special farming, etc., etc. These topics an 

all studied from the stand-point of the farmer, and with a view 

to develop the utmost of profit from soil and labor. These sub- 

jects are studied by reference to books found in the library, and 

in doing this the student gradually learns to find knowledge in 

books, and to read with care and thought, as well as to compare 

what he reads with the results of his own observation a*nd expe- 

r» 

rience. In the second year Horticulture is pursued in the same 

general way. Farther on in the course, when Botany, Physiol- 

ogy and Chemistry have been studied, their teachings are ap- 

plied to the practical studies pursued before. </seg>

students' labor. 

While we greatly prefer that our students should work a part 

of the time, and reserve the right to require it, we have never 

needed to use any compulsion. Our students all work more &lt;&gt;r 

k-ss. We think it better for students to work ¦ part of each da\ . 

It is good for their health, both of body and mind. It equalize 

the circulation, improves the digestion, hardens the muscle, 

clears the mind, and steadily develops energy of character. Tl y 

are paid a fair equivalent for all work done for the college, and 

they do work for farmers living near the institution. This en- 

ables many deserving young men to pay their way through school, 

who could not otherwise do so. We make it a point to give stu- 

dents who wish it, all the work they want. Some pay their en 

tire boarding this way, hut we do not advise students to try to do 

M much as this, unless it is a matter of necessity 

in 

It will serve to show the large amount of labor dotM bj 
udents, to state that in the two y.-ars covered by this report an 

average attendance of twenty st rued as n&gt;ar M 
can be ascertained, something over two thousand dollars. Dur- 

ing a good share of the time they did all or nearly all the work 
of the College Farm and garden, save that dome by one regular 

man. 

It would be much easier for those in charge of the d-par'inent 
to get the work done by regular hired men, yet on the whole the 
advantages of the present plan are so great, that we have no de- 

sire or disposition to abandon it. We feel that the effjrt to help 
needy and deserving young men to gain an education is a worthy 
one ; yet we seek to do this not by gratuitous aid — from which all 
right thinking young men would recoil — but by giving them a 
chance to earn money in a legitimate and honorable way. Surely 
an industrial school worthy of the name should honor and strive 
to dignify labor. We believe that the best productive labor of 
the future is to be the work of willing hands guided by educated 
minds; mind and muscle working in harmony. 

In this connection may be mentioned our need of additional 
room in our dormitory. Last fall term every room in the dormitory 
and farm house was occupied, and if other students had </seg>

Ie, we could not have accommodated them. Our farm is two 
* from town, and students cannot live in town and work on 
farm. Thus we are driven to the necessity of providing 
¦ding accommodations at the farm. If we are to have anv 
ease in numbers next season, we must have additional build- 
The present dormitory, erected in 1875, was constructed 
i the design of adding to it, some time. We estimate that 
00 for this purpose would give us additional accommodations 
from sixteen to twenty more students ; and we earnestly 
t'sent the desirableness of asking the legislature to approte 
this amount. 

MEANS OF ILLUSTRATION. 

In some respects we are quite well provided, in some we are 
etill needy. For illustration of agricultural topics we now have 
a good farm, five breeds of cattle, viz : Short Horns, Herefords, 
Gallmvnvs, Ayrshires and Jerseys, one breed of hogs, 
Berkshires, one of poultry, Plymouth Rocks, and Clydesdale 
horses. In comparative anatomy we have skeletons of the horse 
and the cow. For scientific study we have access to the general 
University cabinet, now quite well endowed. 

WE NEED 

Iiodel of the horse, showing the anatomical parts, and one of 
M domestic bird, as the turkey. These would be of the 
atest use in studying the comparative anatomy of the domestic 
inals. Farther, we should have at least two or three other 
eds of animals for instruction purposes. Besides these, there 
uld be economy in keeping a larger number of females of 
h breed. As we now have to keep males of nearly all the 
eds, the relative profit of keeping a number of females, would 
considerable. Again, we ought to be able to keep a number 
grades of each breed, to enable us to compare them one with 
tther under the same circumstances of care and keeping. 

In the horticultural department we would like to plant as soon 
as possible specimens of all the trees that may be made to grow 
in tlii&gt; latitude and climate, for the purposes of study and com- </seg>

In modern agriculture and horticulture increased attention is 

given to the study of microscopic animals and vegetables. We 

desire that our students should be practically acquainted with 

the use of the microscope. To do this, we need a number of 

compound microscopes for class use. We should have at least 

six for use the coming year. Suitable instruments can be pro- 

cured for from $40 to $60 each, and one much better one should 

be procured for special investigations. 

In the engineering department a number of things are needed 

We have now only a transit and chain. Mr. Little, instructor in 

this department, allows the class to use an engineer's level pur 

chased at his private expense. A large number of models of 

engineering structures might be purchased for a comparatively 
small amount of money, and would be of the greatestvalue. 

ENERAL FAliMIXt 

hi this direction the years' work has been highly successful. 

The crops without a single exception were excellent. The ag- 

gregate production was about the following: Corn, 8,500 

bushels : potatoes, 350 bushels ; onion*. 7"&gt; Imshels ; sugar beets, 

)O 

15 tons ; sorghum cane, 295 tons; Grapes, 5,000 lbs. 

Our sales during the vear were as follows : Live stock, 

$1,047.24 : other farm produce, including sorghum cane, $741.00 ; 

garden produce, $103,72; total, $1,951.06. We still have on 

hand our stock, seed potatoes, some 50 varieties, and vegetable! 

sufficient for the boarding department, for the remainder of the 

time till vegetables come again. Also corn, hay and other feed 

to keep our stock through the winter. 

Our stock of horses now consists of six work horses, all well 

on in years. One of them is one of the first two bought for the 

farm in 1873, and though 17 years old is a good sound horse yet 

Another team is 14, and the other about 11. To take their places 

we have coming on five young horses and colts of various a^e*, 

all half or three-fourths blood Clydesdales. We also have the 

imported Clydesdale horse, Pope. He has proved a valuable 

breeder, and his stock is beginning to have a high reputation in 

the neighborhood. 

Our stock of cattle consists of 2 Short Horns, 4 Hereford^, 8 </seg>

B 


Ayrehires, 5 Galloways and 2 Jerseys. We have also a few 
grades, mostly Short Horns and Galloways. 

Iur farm machinery, new from six to ten years ago, is now 
irning considerably worn, and needs a good deal of repairing, 
mower we bm most, was bought in 1872, the reaper in 1875, 
harvester in 1875. Our three corn plows are respectively 
' and 6 years old. Our mgotu were second hand when 
fht, one in 1873, and one in 1874. Most of these things are 
i for some years yet, but require more careful handling than 
ones. I think it will be conceded that they have lasted 
l than twice as long as such implement! usually do in the 

Euring the year a considerable amount of fencing has beer&gt; 
: for cattle pens, bull pens, etc., and sheds for our fattening 

K'he old barn, which was badly racked, and driven partly from 
foundations by a storm in 1881, was repaired, new sills put 
ler it, settled securely on new foundations, and painted. 

ILll the timbers of the farm scales having decayed so as to renit 
useless, an entirely new frame, bed and platform were 
vided and put in during the fall. The scales were put in in 
4, and have consequently lasted just eight years. The new 
bers were thoroughly coated with hot coal tar, before being 
down, and all places where moisture could remain long were 
&gt;d with the same. The frame put down in this way is good 
ast the next ten vear.-. 

EXPERIMENTS. 

I he purpose of the work done in this direction was a purely 
tical one. Though there are many scientific questions coned 
with agriculture which need answer, we have undertaken 
ling of this kind. In the limited number of experiments 
time and meatib enabled us to make, we have undertaken

The following is a brief account of such of our experiments 
completed or in progress, as may be of general interest. ' A considerable 
amount of time and labor has been expended in pre- 
Bng for future work of this kind, of which no mention Mad 
oade now. 

it is proper to state that in carrying on experiments, I labor 
er the difficulty that I am required to be absent from the 
a every forenoon employed in teaching in the University. I

needed to keep the work of experimentation going on,

that our fund would justify us in employing a foreman who 
Id be trusted to carry on this work, and have had to give my 
-onal attention to it. This condition i&gt;f things makes it imsible 
to do as much in the way of experimenting m m* desire. 

EXPERIMENTS WITH COKN. 

1. Testing varieties of eorn grown at a distance, with the dasiltii 
of finding the best kinds for cultivation in this Btate. The 
following kinds were planted : 

From Michigan — Lackawaxen, Black Mexican, New Triumph 
and Early Boynton. 

From Illinois — Medium Yellow Dent and Large Yellow Dent. 

From Minnesota — Early King Phillip and Early Minnesota. 

Prom Missouri — St. Charles White, Mammoth Giant White 
and Slusher's Mammoth. 

From Dakota — Large Yellow Dent 

From Pennsylvania — Chester Co., Mammoth, Maryland White 

It Menu unnecessay to report in detail on all of these the first 
&gt;u they were grown. At least one hundred hills of each 
kind was planted and nearly all did well. Some of them L r iw 
promise of being very valuable kinds. The Early Kiiiu r Phillip, 
from seed grown in northern Minnesota. wa&lt; sufficiently matured 
by .July 10th, to be cut up to feed hogs. The St. Charles White, 
grown in Missouri in 1881, barely ripened before frost, vet 
promises well. 

2. Two experiments were made in crossing corn from teed 
grown in a distant locality, with our common field eon grow a</seg> 


            <seg id="p008">
t? for several years. A large yellow Dent obtained from Dai 
county, this State, was planted in rows across a forty acre 
1, and as soon as the tassels on these rows appeared they were 
off, leaving the ears to be fertilized by the home grown corn 
U8hel of this cross, fine looking corn, was saved and will be 
ited next year and the result reported. It is hoped that bj 
siiiir varieties grown far apart, a stronger and more prolific 
ety may be secured. It is intended to try this on a larger 
B next year. 

{must be remembered that experiments of this kind to be 
able must be carried on systematically for a series of years. 
have had this in mind and have not generally undertaken 
hut such as we may reasonably hope to be able to go on 
for some time time to come. 

To test the relative productiveness of corn when a different 
number of stalks were left in the hill, there was made ¦ careful 
count of the stalks and hills in nine rows across one of our corn 
tic-Ids. The following is the result: 

-&gt; 

KM 

r those containing but one stalk, one hill in fifteen had no 
and the same proportion had two ears. 

tthe hills with two stalks each, one stalk in ten had no ear 
one stalk in forty-eight had two ears. 

In the class having three stalks in a hill, one stalk in fourteen 
and a half had no ear and one in fifty-three had two ears. 

Of the hills which had four stalks each, one stalk in nine had 
no ear, and one in every 426 had two ears. 

In hills containing tivc -talks, one stalk in every four had no 
o;ir. and there were found no stalks having more than one ear. 

Eo state this in another form : Where there is but one stalk 
ie hill, about seven per cent, had no ears; with two stalks in 
hill, ten per cent had no ears; with three stalks in the hill, 
n per cent, of the stalks had no ears; with four stalks in a

twenty-five per cent, had no ears. So that in this cnse it seems 
barren stalks in the hills having but one stalk is almost exactly 
the same as in the hills having three stalks, and that the proportion 
of stalks without ears, in hills containing four stalks, is but 
one per cent, greater than where there are but two stalks in 

the hill

TAME (JRASSI 

Recognizing the importance of the introduction of tame gr. 
to take the place of natural prairie kinds, now rapidly disappearing, 
considerable attention has been given to the subject, Our 
experiments wore made with a view to finding the best kinds for 
our soil and climate, and the best methods of seeding- 

in the spring of 1881, fourteen kinds of grass seeds were 
n. They were sown in &gt;pring without other crop. Nearly 
-taited in the spring, but the ciTriMBTli drouth of that season 
ed all but one — Orchard grate, i DoetjfHt (jluimrata). This grass 
n. ami at other times, has shown extraordinary power to re- </seg>

•ist the influence of drought. We have had an acre growing on 
the farm since that date, and it has stood the severest Beasons 
without injury. It starts early, keeps green late and yields a 
large amount of forage. 

In the year just passed we have confined our trials principally 
to four kinds, viz: Timothy, by some called herdsgrass ; Red 
Clover, Orchard Gras9 and Kentucky Blue gra— . 

MKTHODS OF SEEDING WITH TAME GRASSES 

Several plans have been tried 

1. Sowing very early in the Rpring on fall sown rye 

Where the rye was pastured and kept rather ihoft the plan 

has been moderately successful. The rye must not be allowed 

to grow to high so as to shade the growing grama too much ; nor 

must it be pastured so close as to allow the ground to get heated 

by the direct rays of the sun. The tramping of the animals 

pasturing on the rye was evidently an advantage to the gn 9 

which grew best where well tramped. One patch of rye which 
was allowed to mature seemed to have choked out the grass t n- 

was a 

tirely, or what little lived through wm burned up by the hot 

•un of midsummer after the shelter of the rye had been re- 

moved 

2. Another plan tried was the following: Somewhat late in 
the spring, about the first of May, the land was plowed and, 
•owed to winter rye, and well harrowed to compact the soil and 
give a smooth surface. On this, timothy, clover and blue gra-s 
were sown and lightly brushed in. Five acres treated in this 
way in the spring of 1882, gave an excellent stand and grew well 
through the season. The rye grew slowly ami spread over the 
ground so as to shade it somewhat without drawing much on the 
moisture. This patch had been used for a hog lot and the soil 
was not in good condition, but it was desirable to get it nil) 
grass as soon as possible, and the experiment was tried. 

3. The most satisfactory plan tried was to sow the grass seed 
quite early in the season without any any other crop. To secure 
the best results on this plan the soil should be plowed the preceding 
fall and well dragged down, so as to be in shape to re- </seg>

            <seg id="p012">
fits moisture. In a fall when the soil is too dry to plow up 
ly and pack well, it would be bettecto leave the plowing till 
ng. WTiere, as will usually happen on old ground, weeds 
e up thi.'kly they must be mown down several times during 
&gt;n. 

A piece sown in the spring of 1882, in this way, grew well 
and bloomed freely in July. June 29th, one square foot of this 
- was cut close to the ground and the weight of green graat 
just eight ounces. At this rate the green grass on an acre 
would have weighed over ten tons, and dried, would have produced 
over two tons of hay. It is true that the early part of 
L882 nu very favorable for the growth of grass, but an equally 
luxuriant growth has been seen m other ve. 

4. We have also had fair success in sowing timothv, blue 

- and clover seed on prairie pastures where the grass was 

The chief difficulty here is that the stock keep the tame grass 

nippe 1 off so close that it has but a poor chance to grow, and 

consequently is a long time in b 

om 

The value of tame grass for pasture in this State may 

sidered established. Tame grasses wi 

noro teea to the a&lt; 

xcepting only during the dry months; they give a full m 

more of grazing in the spring before prairie grasses are up, and 

as much later in the fall. Clover and timothy will retain their 

hold longer here than in the eastern states. In the dryest part of 

¦ seasons they become quite brow 
absence of excessive diouth, 

with fall rains, or even 
become green again. 

There is but one drawback to their extensive growth for hay, 

that i~ the circumstance that it is frequently rainy about the 

time that the tame gras* hay is to be made 

SOILING CROI 

Iieing short of pasture for our stock last season, we were corned 
to feed green crops to some extent. We found rye, orrd 
grass and clovex-raixed, oats, and fodder corn, a succession 
ioiling crops th;4j«rpT~us supplied without break from June 
the frost came. They were fed in the order named above.

to four inches apart and worked same as other corn. The green 

forage was at least twenty tons per acre. 

The amount of forage that may be obtained from an acre of 

the different kinds of grass, is shown by the appended tabular 

•tatement. It also serves to show the comparative weight of the 

green forage of different kinds. 

June 28th, 1882, I cut a square foot of each of five kinds. In

manured. To ensure a good stand and make the experiment 
more reliable the corn was drilled more thickly than it was in 
tended to stand and then thinned by hand. The thinning to one 
stalk in a place took time at the rate of 3£ hours per acre ; to 
t vo stalks in a hill required 2| hours per acre. The corn rec 
ived the usual field cultivation and yielded as follows in bush: 
shelled corn per acre : 

Plat (1) one stalk every foot, 65.3 bushels per acr&lt; 

Plat (2; two stalks every two feet, gave 62.4 bushels per acre. 

Plat (8) three stalks every three feet, yielded 53.2 bushels per 

Plat (4) four stalks every four feet, gave 43.3 bushels per acrt 

As regard* the quality of the corn, it varied with the yield 

W . re but one stalk grew every foot, the ears were larger and 

r. In fact as the number of stalks in each plat was sub- 

stantially the tame, the increased yield of some plats over others 

w.is due to the increase of the size of the ears. In this cast 

s altering the stalks along one foot apart gave 22 bu.-shels per 

over that of the same number of stalks bunched up four 

ther in the same place. If farther experiment in this direc 

should verify this result, check rowing corn ought to bt

II similar experiment was tried in a field where the corn was 
ek rowed. A -his, a 40 acre field, sixteen rows were 
ated, and then (lj four were thinned to one stalk in the hill, 
four to two stalks in the hill, (3) four to three stalks in the 
&gt;ur to four stalks in the hill. The planter used made 
s 3 feet 10 inches apart, and the check rower dropped hills at 
ie distance. The soil was dry upland, which has been culti-3d 
for twelve years constantly, but without manure. The foling 
is the yield in bushels of shelled corn : 

Plat (1), one stalk in the hill, 34.1 bushels. 

Plat (2), two stalks in ihe hill, 47.9 bushels. 

Plat (3), three stalks in the hill, 50.5 busheh 
Plat (4), four stalks in the hill, 54.3 bushels.

to the number. Four stalks in a hill give but a littlfl more than 

one-lialf more than one. The acre with three stalks yielded but 

2.6 bushels more than the one with two stalks 

Comparing plat (4) of the check rowed corn with plat (4) of 

the drilled corn, we see that the check rowed was much the 

in the ratio of 54.3 bushels to 43.3, eleven bushels more per acre 

W - this due to the better cultivation possible where the ground

drilled corn grew, the better corn land, though there may bo 

loubt of this. There are many interesting questions r

The corn was fed directly from the field, but was in the best 
shape to make a jii&lt;r train flesh rapidly. The cane seed at first 
(uite immature and somewhat chafiy. After the first two 
weeki it was better. 

So far as can be judged from this single trial, sorghum seed to 
feed pigl, il worth about half as much as corn. 

Es soon as milder weather in the spring comes, we design try 
experiment! to test the relative value of dry corn and sor 
m seed which has been threshed and cleaned. I have goor 
on to believe that in this condition the sorghum seed wil 
v a greater relative value than in the experiment just dc 

In the fall of 1881 we weighed out a lot of fattening hogs and 
them ¦ little overs month with sorghum seed and skimmings 
m the evaporation at the sorghum mill. These hogs were fed 
seed that grew on six acres of ground, and an indefinite 
uititv of skimmings. The total increase in weight of the 
£8 brought in market just one hundred dollars. BTo account 
the amount of seed fed was kept 0£ of the gain of individual 
rs. {for w;ts it possible to determine the value of the skimngs 
fed. The experiment shows that it is economical and 
&gt;fitable to feed hogs in connection with sorghum manufacture

It may be observed that the cost of filling a single silo is 

greater proportionately than where several are filled at the same 

time. 

The only other trial of ensilage known to the writer to have 

been made in this State, is that of the West Point Creamery, in 

Cuming county. 

I append here for comparison, some figures taken from a rt 

port made by Mr. L. B. Eager, Vice President of the Creamery 

Company, to the Department of Agriculture, at Washington : 

Average ji«ld of corn fodder per acre, (green) 12£ tons 

Number of silos 4 

Capacity of silos 720 tons 

Et per ton in 1881, including preparation of ground, 
ied, cultivation, cutting in field, handling, cutting at 
lo, placing weight, putting up doors, fuel, and housig 
engine 92 cents. 

Mr. Eager reports the greatest yield of cornstalks cut from 

anv one acre to be fiftv-eight tons. The average field he says, 

was greatly lowered by the small yield on eighty acres of poor, 

sandy land. 

Professor Johnson, of the Michigan Agricultural College, 

after testing the feeding value of ensilage for oue season, esti- 

mates that with meal at $25 per ton, hay at ten dollar* per ton, 

corn stalks and oat straw, at four dollars per ton, and rutabagas 

at forty cents a bushel, ensilage was worth eight dollars per ton. 
In the light of our present limited experience we think corn 

fodder may be put in the silos at a cost of from one dollar to 

one dollar and fifty cents ;&amp;gt;er ton. It only remains to test the 

feeding value of food preserved in this way ton for ton, with that 

dried and kept in the ordinary way. This we hope to do in the 

future with as much care and exactness as we are able to give it. 

PROJECTED EXPERIMENTS 

During the next and following years, we expect, if means are 
furnished, to undertake or continue the following experiments. 
Some of these are already begun, and ought to be continued a 
number of years. Tests made in a single year are not to be relied 
on implicitly. </seg>

For the information of those into whose hands this pamphlet 
may come, and who may not be acquainted with the institution, 
a brief account of its course of study, and general arrangement 
is appended. The object of the school is to train up a body of intelligent, 
practical, progressive farmers. 

AGRICULTURAL COl'RSK 

In arranging the Agricultural Course two governing principles 
have been regarded: 1. Prominence is given to the sciences 
in proportion to their directness of their relation to fanning.

The study of Entomology, besides the general principles of 
the science, is confined largely to injurious insects and the means 
of preventing their ravages. A special study is made of the 
Natural History of the Bee, and instruction given in the best 
methods of keeping bees for profit. Under Meteorology are 
studied the laws of climate and the effects of climate influences 

on vegetation. Landscape Gardening is studied from Kemp's 
text-book, with such illustrations as are accessible. C~
