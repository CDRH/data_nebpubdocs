            <seg id="p005">5 GENERAL SURVEY In December, 1903, George F. Kenower, President of the Board of Regents, having resigned, Regent John L. Teeters was chosen temporary chairman. In January, 1904, the official term of Regents Kenower and von Forell expired. In the fall of 1903 Charles S. Allen of Lincoln and William Q. Whitmore of Valley had been chosen to succeed them. These Regents met with the Board for the first time in February, 1904. In June, 1904, Regent John L. Teeters was chosen President of the Board, succeeding President Kenower.

            <seg id="p008">8 Thtt University continues to prosper. Its growth is steady, its dis - cipline kind but firm, its standards Increasingly high, and its teaching force. In the branches most important to the intelligence of the state, large. The chief expansion of its staff since our last report has been In branches relating to agriculture and the mechanic arts, fields In which the State's immediate requirements seem to us the greatest. A department of Institutional History has been created, and George E. Howard, formerly professor of History here, has been recalled and placed In charge of it The courses in Forestry, which have been in operation over a year, are proving popular, the likelihood being that demand for training in this Interesting branch will increase in the near future, especially through the afforestation policy adopted by the National Government, which has already been put in operation within our State. Iursuant to an act of the last legislature, the University has pur - i and opened at North Platte a large estate composed partly of hie but mostly of non-irrigable land, arable and pasture, where Iments are already in progress calculated, with other and ampler later, to throw helpful light on agricultural and pastoral problems 5 semi-arid portions of the State. Ee important function of high school Inspector, surrendered by Mr. Crabtree, now Principal of the Normal School at Peru, has been ed to Professor T. Morey Hodgman. Mr. Hodgman has entered is duties with an assiduity believed to assure his success. A fact of much Interest Is the closer approach witnessed in recent years between the University and the high schools. It has long been the theory that the University was an integral part of the State's educa - tional system, its cap and crown, being grades 13, 14, 15 and 16, joining on to the high schools just as the high school, comprising grades 9, 10, 11, and 12, joins on to the grades below. But this theory did not very com - pletely fit the facts so long as full high school graduates from fully ac - credited schools, owing to the specialty of many requirements for entering the University, often found their qualifications not of the right kind, and were obliged either to wait and prepare on a number of required subjects beyond those they had already mastered, or else to enter burdened with conditions to be worked off by studying extra time. Lately this cause of friction has been, in the main, annulled by in - crease in the number and proportion of the non-specfled items of require - ment. There is reason to hope that in a few years it will be possible for k graduate of an accredited high school providing four years of work nter the University without condition, irrespective of the special ches which such pupil may have pursued in his preparatory course. In all the faculties teaching has been able and painstaking. The Dean's reports indicate to some extent how wide a scope the various </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 curricula cover; but there is, unfortunately, no way of exhibiting to the public the zeal and fidelity with which the different subjects are expounded to pupils, "line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little." All the members of faculties have been exemplary in industry. A great many of them are continually engaged in original research. S'ith funds to remunerate the necessary supervision better correlation artments might be effected. In cases this is highly desirable. Every ment should certainly be free Internally, yet each should be carried th due regard to kindred work elsewhere in the University. Kur staff is now strong enough to justify organizing a school of history olitical science, assuring a more scientific coordination of instruction now prevails among the various and very Important sciences in the named. Should such a more perfect grouping prove valuable in thia ice, the improvement might after a time be extended. The elective system, operative in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, is disclosing some incidental defects. Thoughtless, easy going, and immature students make ill choices of studies. A plan to obviate this infelicity has been proposed requiring every student to hav a faculty adviser and to consult him both in regard to the student's course* in general and in regard to his particular studies semester by semeste In the same interest a classification of all courses as majors and minors with insistence on a certain number of majors as necessary to a degre is favored by some. Neither of the palliatives suggested has thus far secured a majority vote in the college faculty concerned, so that the subjec must be urged upon them for further study. Kor the year ending June, 1902. the attendance at the University in partments was 2289; during 1902-3 it rose to 2560; for the year ending June, 1904, the figure was 2513. Registration for this year is as yet iplete, but it will probably not fall below 2700. The health of students has during the past two years been unusu - ally good, only two deaths having occurred, one of these by accident I 'he conduct of the students has for the most part been all that could Mired. In so large a body of youth a few aberrations are to be ex - d, but it is gratifying to be able to believe that the State University lunity has, in respect to the morality of its membership, no superior, has an equal, in this or in any country, among student communities I students social affairs have a close bearing on the University's wel- Greek letter societies have become part of the United States uni - ty system, yet considerable abuses, which it is most difficult to reach, * in connection with them. Membership in these organizations often painfully to student expenses. Parents should remember that such bership is in no sense necessary or required, students' scholarship, ■ation, standing and influence being quite independent of the ques - whether they join these bodies or not The old literary societies, the </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Rian, the Union, and the Delian, still do noble work, socially as well a tally; so that membership in them is most desirable. It would seem that not a few students enter the University simply to Join fraternities or sororities. Having thus secured, as they think, social standing, many discontinue their studies, at the same time remain - ing in residence at their society houses as sources of demoralization for students wishing to work. The conviction is spreading that fraternity in - itiations should be supervised and that pledging should be postponed until the student in name has demonstrated his purpose to be a student in fact The majority of Greek letter society people appear to wish such reforms, aware that, without them, the reputation of the societies for character and scholarship suffers. The Regents stand ready to enact remedial regula - tions, but, for the present, await request therefor from the organizations primarily interested. Germane to the above evil is the rising scale of personal expenditure among our students, accompanying prosperous times and the growing wealth of the state. The extremely "Simple Life," once the rule at the University, has become almost rare. It is the aim so to administer the institution that no ingenuous or worthy youth, however poor, shall ever feel out of place here. We should be glad of resources enabling us to control prices of student necessities, such as rooms, board and books, in the interest of economy, health, good manners and simplicity. Another phenomenon occasioning some concern is the decreasing pro - portion of men, as compared with women, taking academic and general courses. In liberal studies women are rapidly winning the ascendant. Some very important culture courses have scarcely a male member apiece. It 1b not clear that the change results wholly from the popular tendency of the day to the so-called practical and the material. We must inquire if other factors are not at work. Have our programs or methods of in - struction been growing effeminate, appealing to routine industry and memoriter proficiency, discouraging independent reflection and deep thought? Does our teaching lack spirit and unction? Is it richer in mechanism and details than in life? The subject deserves careful investi - gation by a faculty committee. If present tendencies continue, two schools will result, one for women, monopolizing the specially educational and cultural subjects, hitherto regarded as of the greatest possible value in the development of choice humanity, and the other for men, teaching onl/ "bread and butter studies." The University could hardly suffer a worse calamity than a cleavage like this, if complete or even pronounced.

Lighting plant, wiring, motor* and the covering of pipes cost $1,200. Experiment Station, repairs, hall decoration, and the remodelling of dairy building rooms for laboratory me, about $500; steam tunnels completing connection from boiler house to all buildings. $3,600; power boiler and mechanical stokers, $4,400; coal bankers extension giving capacity of 500 tons, $3,350; new scales at Farm and on campus, approximately $400. Replacing of the Nebraska Hall gables cost $600; while general repairs on the various university premises have been effected, costing about $12,000. The portion of the above sums laid out at the Farm amounts to nearly $100,000— exactly $98,420. Ethe University Campus thorough repairs, amounting to new con - on, have been completed in the chemical laboratory, the entire r having been remodelled and supplied with modern apparatus for tory work, the whole costing $21,500. A new Physics building is g completion, the cost of which will be $75,000. A new Adminis - i building costing $35,000 will soon be in process of construction. The University's real estate needs are still great, and, at points. pressing. Not to speak of a new central edifice in place of University Hall, which is highly desirable, the call for a capacious fire proof museum to house the valuable materials donated and ready to be donated by Hon. ex-Regent C. H. Morrill and others, is one which cannot be ignored longer. Without a woman's dormitory at the Farm the School of Agri - culture loses half Its usefulness to the State. A general auditorium, capable of seating the entire University community, is a crying necessity. An astronomical observatory is almost so. Larger quarters for our Engineering work, whether a new building or in the way of extension to Mechanic Arts Hall, cannot be long deferred. A separate edifice for the College of Law and for the College of Medicine must also be built in the not remote future. Land should be bought as soon as possible both for the farm and near the city plant. University athletics cannot continue to thrive without a new athletic field. The erection of the physics building on the old area has cut down its dimensions to such an extent that effective baseball can no longer be played here. Much of the ill luck that has beset us in football the past fall is directly traceable to the cramped and otherwise unfavorable condition of our grounds. The soil of the campus is not suitable either for diamond, for track, or for gridiron. Players have been constantly on our hospital list this year on account of injuries received through the roughness and flint-like hardness of the soil on which they played. The ground is too hard to permit fast time by runners. The diamond has to be worked upon constantly to keep it in any sort of condition for the limited uses of which it is capable. Ke University has come to be much more than a teaching institution, turn to it for counsel upon almost every subject. It is identified </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 lem which arises on any farm or in any community. Schools appeal to the University for information on text-books, equip - ment, and courses of study, and for expert teachers. Inquiries are made concerning soils, minerals and water. Advice in regard to the planting and care of crops is freely sought and as freely given. The question what trees to set out for shade or for forest is asked over and over again by intending growers, who turn to our Forestry Department for reply. Problems about the stock of farm or of range; how to purchase or handle to the best advantage, how to fatten, how and when to market with the greatest profit, come to various departments and receive expert attention. Does anything ail a crop or a fruit tree, the case is at once reported to the University, from which aid is confidently expected. It is not only thus in response to inquiries that the University serves the people; in many inquiries we have taken the initiative, directing search or practice till important results were reached. From the Univer - sity proceeded the original suggestion that the Nebraska sand-hills could and with profit, be covered with pine forests. It was upon our grounds and from representations made by our professors that the purpose took •hape in the minds of government experts leading to the establishment by the United States of the forest reserves in the sand-hills, where pines are now "actually growing with the utmost vigor and promise, assuring iimwii to the afforestation policy and the profitable afforestation, in time, 01 all the sandy areas in Nebraska. It was to assist, still further, this work so advantageous to our State, that the University created its De - partment of Forestry, training young men in forest problems. Eufessors of Agriculture and related branches have by their publica - and their conduct of classes exerted much valuable influence in ing agricultural and nature study teaching in the common schools. Irhe University has led in suggesting and in fitting up modern labor - es and libraries in high schools. We have urged better apparatus richer appliances in general, and advised and counselled school boards superintendents, until improved and progressive conditions are the The time has come for more liberal remuneration to the University Faculty, many of whose members are regarded by authorities the country over as among America's foremost teachers and specialists. I Professors have worked in Nebraska till their reputations were made, to leave us for other universities bent on securing able men. Such lemen usually prefer to remain here, removing only because with us r future seems fiscally unpromising, while offers from other states generous. Nebraska cannot afford to let this brain leakage continue, best teaching talent in the land is none too good to instruct Nebraska Our University pays heads of departments lower salaries than any similar state institution, perhaps $500 below the average.

Nebni 000. An investigation into retail prices recently conducted by Professor W. G. L. Taylor, containing report from forty-one Lincoln firms, touching a large number, of staple articles, shows an average advance in prices of thirty and a tenth per cent since 1894. Faculty budgets from detailed accounts kept by sixteen members of the University Faculty show a rise of expenditure, 1900-1904, of 28.4 per cent This result corresponds remarkably with the rise in prices revealed by the dealers. Food prices in the North Central states have risen from 94.6 in 1896 to 111.7 in 1902. The ability of a farming com - munity to pay well for services is shown by the great rise in the prices of farm products. I Since 1865 — and the salaries of our professors were fixed at a later —general wages in the United States have steadily risen. So far as advance was due to fall in general prices, fixed incomes shared in it, so far as the advance has been due to rise in money wages, fixed nes have not shared. It is thus obvious that most members of our faculties are underpaid. In fact our salary schedule differs little from that on which professors taught twenty-five years ago, when the University was an experiment funds were meagre and students numbered only a few hundred. This year the attendance will probaUy reach 2700, while good buildings and modern apparatus, with superior teaching, make the University one of the choicest in the land, a position attained largely through the influence and repu - tation ot teachers serving on very small salaries. Such efficiency on so low salary payments of course can not continue. The situation betrays baa policy as well as injustice, as it must have the effect of weeding out our best talent. Besides some increase to salaries provision ought to be made at once for certain additions to the teaching capacity of the University. The equivalent of four new professors ought at once to be added to the instructional corps in agriculture and related subjects, thus relieving </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Ktperiment station chiefs entirely or almost entirely from teaching and making possible a greater specializing of subjects taught within •ovince of agriculture proper. I good teacher of Botany must be secured permanently for the School riculture. With the growth of the School in size and importance we &gt; longer depend for teachers upon men studying for advanced degrees. rofessor should have his office and study in the new building at the and such apparatus, specimens, books, and other appliances as scessary for the most modern presentation of Agricultural Botany. B'he duty confronts us, urged, and justly, by the leading fruit grower* e state, of making ample provision for investigating plant diseases, demand must be met at the earliest moment, and plant pathology a regular line of inquiry at the Experiment Station. That the College of Law may be made the greatest possible credit and benefit to the State it should at once have an additional professor as well as a much larger sum for the purchase of dooks. Ehe valuable instruction already given in the history and criticism of ne arts should be amplified into a full professorship; and besides % professorship of architecture established. Kie foregoing exhibit of the University's needs does not seem to us id. It names no item of mere ideal desirableness, such as might propriate were our state vastly more populous and opulent; but itself to the requirements which the history, the pride, the pro - ve spirit and the rapidly increasing wealth of the Nebraska people - imperative. I.Ve make no complaint of the incessant pinching economy to which re forced. We engage to make every bit of money entrusted to us go 'arthest possible. We plead only that the State shall not neglect its invaluable property represented by the University in its various Lical and useful departments, but cherish the plant as it deserves, Ing it increasingly as the years pass, not only a profitable financial itment, rich in material returns to the industries of the State, but as istrumentality ministering to the higher life of ourselves, our children their children. FINANCIAL Before tne last biennium the University cash fund and the money donated by the United States for the experiment station and the college of agriculture and the mechanic arts had reached the University sometimes as independent appropriations, sometimes as items in the general appropria - tion bills. All together they now aggregate about $190,000.00 biennially. The method of including them in the general appropriation bills is open to the serious objection that, not understanding the nature and sources of the three funds, most persons are misled into the belief that the state Is taxed to supply this money. The grand totals of the general appropria - tion bills are thus fictitiously inflated. The legislature of 1903 declared </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 •gainst that policy and in favor of a separate appropriation of the three funds named in a single bill, which was passed for that purpose. The Regents follow the suggestion of the legislature in this matter, and will present a bill for the separate appropriation of the University cash fund and the United States donations for the ensuing biennium. Eie legislative limit upon the University cash fund for the two year* ; March 31, 1905, is $85,000.00. It is now apparent that considerably than that sum will be realized. The excess must be carried forward b added to the fund for the next two years. It is therefore necessary Tease the limit of this fund when next appropriated to $110,000.00. The Regents feel that the maintenance of the experimental substation and farmers' institutes should not continue a draft upon funds consecrated to the support of the University. Those items were taken over to the temporary University fund two years ago under pressure of the opinion current in the legislature that the University revenues would be more than doubled under the new revenue law. That opinion proved to be not well founded. The development of the substation and farmers' institutes are valuable and efficient measures in the progress of an agricultural state. The direction and control of them is very properly placed in the hands of the regents, where it can be most efficiently and economically exercised. But the Regents hold that the money necessary to maintain them should be provided from the general fund of the state. The management and a considerable share of the service, which the University would still furnish, is a sufficient charge upon its resources, and the regents urge that the University fund should be used as strictly as possible for University purposes. A woman's building is greatly needed on the farm to open the ad - vantages of the practical farm schools, dairy school and school of house - hold economy and art to the young women of the state coming from its farm homes. The Regents desire to erect on the farm, during the next biennium, one wing of a building for this purpose, and, in case the sub - station and institutes are provided for as above urged, they recommend the expenditure of $32,000.00 from the University fund for said building instead of for the support of substation and institutes. E sides support for the institutes and for the substation, there are other extraordinary expenses which the regular University income bear, yet they cannot be postponed without calamity. E provision has been made t &gt; purchase apparatus for the new Physics &gt;ry. Ten thousand dollars is the least sum that will answer ade - and suitably this call. Two thousand dollars are needed for fitting up the new library in the School of Agriculture. Bight thousand dollars are equally necessary to provide additional shelving room for the general library. These subject* have been reported upon by a competent committee and the necessary expense marked down to the lowest figure. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 A further appropriation of $10,000 is required for the purchase of book* for the University library. In support of this request the following points are presented for consideration: 1st. Six years ago there were twenty-five departments of instruction sharing in the library book fund. Today there are forty-three and our money for books, less in 1904 than in 1898, has not increased during these ■ix years. This means that each department gets $2.70 from every $100 now as against $4 in 1898. The pressure upon the library for new books has never been so great as now. Our library should contain not 65,000 volumes, but 150,000. We are far from the great libraries of the land. Our own library Kbe large enough to encourage strong men to come here, both as ts and as instructors, without the certainty that all chance for creative scholarship must be left behind. 2nd. The University library is the largest reference library not only in the state but in this entire region. We have a great opportunity to build up the most notable reference library between the Mississippi river and California. No one thing will add so much to the renown of the University as an easy supremacy in library facilities. Thia supremacy we now hold by a narrow margin, becoming less each year as Iowa (this year spending $10,000 for books) and Missouri (this biennium spending $35,000 for books) are increasing their book funds while our own is de- CT€A£iUK&gt; The library of this University is maintained with state money, its reading room and shelves are freely open to all, while books not in constant request are frequently loaned to schools, colleges and citizens in other parts of the state. The library is glad to recognize these obliga - tions and to meet them as fully as possible with justice to our immediate University constituency. 3rd. The following figures show the number of books added to th« library by purchase each of the past five years In view of the fact that a much larger land area is vital not alone to Koeperity but to the very existence of the University, a sum for real at least large enough to make up (with the sums required by the rdinary demands just mentioned) $100,000, is the least the Regents can consistently request for this purpose. Two years ago the University appropriations were adjusted to the ■•y that the grand assessment for 1904 would reach $350,000,000.00 for ion purposes. A contingent appropriation of $35,000.00 based upon event failed to become available the grand assessment falling short e estimate by nearly $56,000,000.00.

            <seg id="p018">18 This excess of appropriations over resources, due to the uncertain re - sults of an entirely new revenue system, will be materially reduced, first, by lapsing of a portion of the appropriation for purchase of real estate and, •econd by a less percentage of delinquency than the Regents estimated. It Is safe to say that the excess of appropriations over actual resources for the biennium ending March 31, 1905, will not exceed $20,000.00 and the Regents have covered that sum into the estimates for the biennium ending March 31. 1907. The Regents' estimates of resources and expenditures for the next brennium are given immediately below. Following these are given general financial summaries for the two years ended November 30, 1904.

SHERMAN, Dean of the Graduate School REPORT OF THB DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF LITERATURE, SCIENCE AND THE ARTS To the Chancellor and Board of Begents: I lie records of the Registrar's Office show the attendance in the Col - of Literature during 1902-3 was 1047 students. During 1903-4 it was itudents. At the time of writing the attendance is 891 students. At ■orresponding period of 1903 it was 938 students. To be brought into continuous daily contact, for several years, with such numbers selected from a commonwealth built up by pioneers them - selves selected not only from the nation but from the world, is, in itself alone, no mean part of a liberal education. When one adds to this the influence and guidance of the many capable men in the faculty with the opportunities of laboratory, library and seminary it would seem almost as if the sole need were complete freedom for the student to choose that which befitted his condition; that with so many and so great sources of inspiration open to him he need but freely drink his fill. And, in very truth, if the student have the proper thirst for knowledge, the proper love for culture; if, moreover, he have a preliminary training enabling him to understand and meditate upon the visions that will be brought before the eyes of his soul; then he may well, nay, he had better be left to himself , without let or hindrance, to grow in grace and knowledge. Such an one, Indeed, already has the best that the University can give and our endeavors should be preserve in him, with no diminution, the (error Divine. But the many necessarily fall below this ideal. They need help and guidance, even warning, at times, spurring. With our large and increasing numbers the difficulty of reaching and satisfying the needs of each grows year by year more arduous. What shall be done to lighten it? First and foremost, it seems to me, should be care to see that those </seg>
            <seg id="p033">33 not properly qualified do not enter the College. In this matter the High Schools of the State will continue to render great assistance. It is for us to hold up their hands. Even more perfectly than in the past can ac - crediting be done. This is a matter of simple justice to the better schools. Even more firmly, too, than in the past, can we turn back those, who, ac - cording to the statements of the schools, have not met our requirements for admission. This is living up to our professions, is common honesty, is a matter of justice both to the student who has met our requirements and to the school that seeks to hold all its students to those requirements. Moreover, it is true kindness to the student who falls short. Better is It that the final years of his course should be cut out than that the beginning, the foundation should be insecure. And to put upon the University the burden of preparatory work is to seriously hamper its proper function of caring for those who are prepared. Therefore, it seems to me, before an applicant becomes a student of the College, such deficiency as his cre - dentials show should be covered by an examination successfully passed. More complete provision is needed also for the examination of students coming from non-accredited schools. Accrediting means nothing and in - spection is nugatory, if we do not discriminate against students coming from these. And we should bear in mind, that in some subjects, even the passing of an examination will not warrant the granting of credit. Mere book work in the sciences is usually worthless. Chemistry without a laboratory, astronomy without an observatory, but wastes the student's time. It should, of course, be left to each department of the University to determine on the basis of the Inspector's report or otherwise, whether it is worth while to even examine in its subjects students from the poorly equipped schools. I All this examining means trouble and expense, but it is in the end reater effectiveness in teaching and of therefore greater usefulness to youth of the state. Possibly the Inspector in conjunction with the cipals of the accredited schools, could aid us in this matter. Examina - 3 for entrance to the University in the autumn might be simultaneously by these Principals the preceeding June. For applicants desiring credit over and above the 28 points required for entrance, a rule of the faculties calls for an examination. |&gt;f hardly less importance than this hedging about the admission to the ge is the care to be taken of the first year students. For the sake eee, some of us must needs partially forego the delights of multiplied ies and advanced instruction. It is for us the rather to multiply sec - for properly handling these first year men and to give supervision inspiration to the teaching. Though Fellows and Scholars can aid the more mechanical details of the work, upon them should not be rn too great responsioility. It is doubtful if a Scholar should teach I, if a Fellow should teach more than five hours per week. Even that Id be under close supervision. With this as a maximum of class work </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 Eholars and Fellows would have left the energy to enter zealously UiusiastioalK upon that search-work which is the University s crown For the rest of the student's work the only restrictions are as follows: Of the hours required for graduation, 20 shall be in foreign language; not more than 40 shall be in any one department. Moreover, during the Freshman year, there is required At least two of the following: Greek Latin . . 4 French German Mathematics The intention, as 1 remember it, at the time of the adoption of this almost free elective system, was to require the 2, 4 or 5 hours, as the case might be, each semester, whatever of these subjects were taken during the student's first semester being continued in the next. This is borne out by the fact that Rhetoric 1 and 2 are each 2 hours. It seems to me that further general regulations might advantageously be made, as for example, the following: 1. All subjects taken uy the first-year students shall be continued for one year. BBy the end of his first year each student shall, with the approval i head of the department concerned, select some major subject, to , during his course, he will devote at least 30 hours. K Thereafter all of his other elections shall be made with the approval head of the department in which his major is taken. The first of these requirements would considerably simplify looking after the first year men and holding them down to work. Ee second would tend to remedy the complaint, heard on every hand, ents not going on, as formerly they did, with a line of work once The third would secure to the students the advice of one who pre - sumably most cordially sympathizes with his aims and ideals. Eher requirements in addition to or instead of these might be made, hole subject is under advisement by the committees on examinations, inauent students, and on course of study. Finally, may I be pardoned for calling attention to an apparent in - justice affecting the Industrial College students quite as much as those in my College. The Calendar (page 155) says, "The credit hour ... is equal to one hour of recitation or lecture a week requiring two hours of preparation or laboratory work." The theory underlying this would seem to be that laboratory serves as preparation for lecture, while itself re - quiring no preparation. It is closer to the facts to say that the lecture plus study prepares for the laboratory. In addition to this, there is frequently study required upon the problems arising in the laboratory.

DAVIS, Dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Art* REPORT OF THE DEAN OF THE INDUSTRIAL COLLEGE To the Chancellor and Board of tiegents: The increase in the number of students in the Industrial College (called the "Agricultural College" in some states) has been quite pro - nounced during the biennium. This is significant when it is remembered that the studies in all courses are very largely fixed, the elective o optional studies having been reduced to a minimum. Upon entering th College the student elects which of two great lines of work he will enter the scientific, or the engineering, and a year later, when he has had the benefit of a year's study and experience, he chooses which particular line of science or engineering he will follow. In this second year's wor the subjects are all rigidly prescribed in most cases, and in no group o •s is the student allowed to elect more than 30 per cent of his work In .he Junior year the amount of prescribed studies is about the same in the last year of the student's stay in college he is given a good deal of liberty in the election of studies, amounting in ?ome cases to 60 per cent of his work. In the more technical groups, however, very few ves are generally allowed, and in some there are none at all. In spiie of these limitations and restrictions the number of students in the College has increased in numbers, as shown by the table below. Students who want a praticular training do not object to having their studies care - laid out for them in tiefinite and rather rigid curricula. This seems to be wuat these facts imply.

            <seg id="p036">36 An analysis of the registrations shows that nearly two-thirds of the students in college classes are in the engineering groups. Adding to these the students in the other technical groups, — Agriculture, Forestry, and Premedical, — we find that fully 80 per cent of the students in college classes are pursuing technical lines of work. Since all who are in the several schools (Agriculture, Mechanic Arts, and Domestic Science) are strictly technical students, the preponderance of these over those taking general scientific courses is still greater, amounting to more than 90 per cent. A further analysis shows that of the whole number of students in all departments of the Industrial Cellege, viz. 754, fully 38 per cent are in agri - cultuial, and 39 per cent in mechanical and engineering work. That the College is accomplishing its purpose of teaching "those branches of learn - ing which are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts," as designated in the Congressional Act of 1862, is very evident from these figures. In the foregoing discussion we find an explanation of the fact that ndustrial College is becoming more and more a college of men, and with a rapid increase in the aggregate number of students there has a decrease in the number of women. Technical courses of study do ppeal to women as they do to men, and apparently this has influenced ■ not to register in the college in which they constitute such a small decreasing minority.

REPORT OF THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF LAW To the Chanc llor and Board of Begents: ■The numerous and radical changes which have taken place since the report, require a more detailed statement than would be proper ordi - y. Prior to the school year 1903-4, the course prescribed for the bachelor's degree in law extended over two years only. Some attempt was made to mitigate this evident defect in the course by omitting the usual Saturday recess and by making the lecture periods an hour and a half instead of an hour in length. But these somewhat heroic measures by no means sufficed to provide a course of adequate extent, since the number of hours in the entire course, allowing one and a naif hours to each period and taking one hour of class work a week for a semester as the unit, was but 48, whereas we now require &amp;0 hours for graduation. This increase in the number of hours of instruction by no means represents the whole gain which has accrued from the new arrangement The work is not merely more extensive, but we are able to make it much more thorough. New sub - jects of importance have been included in the program, but, what is more Important, we are now able to devote a suitable amount of time to the several subjects taught. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 As a result of the increase in the time requirements, an important change in methods of instruction has become possible. When the course la short and the instructors are engaged in active practice which demands a large share of their energies, lectures or text books must necessarily be made the basis of instruction. The improved method of teaching law now in use in the leading institutions of the country and rapidly coming into we everywhere, makes such demands upon the time both of the student and of the teacher, that in a brief or hurried survey of a subject it would not be advisable. On the other hand, with a corps of instructors who give substantially their whole time to the school, and with the opportunity for more thorough instruction afforded by a longer course, we can not conform too rapidly to the results of experience in the best schools of the country. The time when the merits of instruction based upon adjudicated cases was debateable has passed. SMch instruction is more scientific, in that it leads the student to the sources and requires him to read them for himself and reach the principles of the law at first hand instead of taking them at second hand, prepared and predigested, with little or no notion where jr how they are to be found in practice. It is also more practical in that it fits the student directly and especially for the task of finding the law, recognizing it when found, and convincing others that he has found it, which is a chief part of the lawyer's work. The common objection that this method does not lead the student to the principles of the law is wholly unfounded. The student learns principles by any method. He may learn them from a textbook in which they are set out in detail as the author has deduced them from the authorities, or he may read the authorities them - selves, under suitable guidance, and, learning the use of the authorities and the way in which principles are deduced from them or establish! them and how the courts apply them in actual controversies, may reach his own conclusions exactly as the lawyer must do in practice. While each Instructor should be left free to apply the method in his own way, I think we may well insist on a general adherence to it, and I feel very strongly that all appointments for the future should be made with such a require - ment in view. The course of study as it now stands, provides for 12 hours a week for the first year, and 14 hours a week for each of the two years following. In my opinion, this requirement should be increased to 15 hours in the second and third years. So long as the State accepts our diploma in lieu of the regular bar examination, we should fall short of our duty if we failed to include in the required work the whole field of what a bar exami - nation ought to embrace. And, however, proper or desirable a wider range of election may be elsewhere, we are not ripe for it in this portion of the country. The practice of the law here calls for a wide range of legal knowl - edge. It is general practice. Very little specialization is possible. Hence we may properly examine upon more subjects for the degree than in schools whose diplomas are not accepted for admission to the bar, and may well require subjects to be taken which in other parts of the country are wisely made optional. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">39 knowledge of such a subject as law "requires to know everything which a practical man knows, and to know a good deal more." This requirement should govern in making a program of legal instruction. It is not enough to afford the training in the fundamental principles of the common law essential to practice in any jurisdiction where that system obtains. The student should also have an opportunity to become acquainted with the principles and practice of conveyancing, with the special subjects of im - mediate or local importance in this and the neighboring states, and with the peculiarities of procedure in those jurisdictions, so as to enable him to enter upon the practice at once without any further term of practical in - struction in an office. On the other hand, if he has the time and the means so that he is able to defer these purely practical subjects to an appren - ticeship in an office, he should have an opportunity to round out his scien - tific knowledge of our system by study of Public Law, International Law, Roman Law, Legal History and kindred subjects. Here, it seems to me, is the true function of elective subjects in a law school. Pleading, general practice, and the jurisdiction and procedure of the federal courts, being of general application, should be, as we make them, required subjects. Conveyancing, as the practice varies in different states and the principles are taught in the courses upon property, may well be elective. So with mining and irrigation, important as they are to many of our students. All these are provided for. But I think we should go further and should provide special elective courses in the code and practice of this state, in probate practice, and possibly in practice in the supreme court, to meet the wants of students who are to practice in this state and to insure ade - quate understanding of those important subjects by those who are to appear in our courts. On the other side, adequate provision is made, but for the temporary abeyance of the work in public law. By the coming of Professor Howard to the University, we are assured of excellent instruction in legal and institutional history, and provision is made whereby law students may avail themselves of some of his courses and receive credit therefor. The work of the practice courts has been enlarged and extended. W« now conduct three justices' courts, a district court in two divisions, and a supreme court, in which all students are required to participate. By using the first year students as parties, witnesses and jurors, and instructing parties and witnesses beforehand so that the students who serve as attor - neys and counsel must ascertain the facts of their cases by inquiry and examination, and determine the proceeding to be brought and the way of bringing it for themselves, the conditions of actual practice may be closely appromixated. These practice courts are very exacting upon the instructor, but they have been successful beyond expectation, and should receive all the attention necessary to their fullest efficiency. Our library facilities are still very inadequate. The matriculation and diploma fees will suffice to keep up a library, but they will not suffice to </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 procure one. It is not merely that modern methods of legal study require fall Bets of reports for the immediate use of students. The student, if he is to go to the bar fully equipped and is to be of service to the community because of his legal knowledge, should know the literature of the law thor - oughly. He should know what the books are and should have handled them more or less, and thus have learned their value and application With our present meager library it is often impossible to do creditable work. The State Library, which is complete and up-to-date, happily miti - gates this difficulty in part, but the habitual use of that library by students is an expense to the State as well as an inconvenience to those for whom It is primarily intended, and cannot continue much longer. I desire to urge, therefore, that early and adequate provision be made for a library suitable to our needs. The teaching force also is inadequate. Under the two-year course, s.s it stood in 1902-3, the program of instruction called for 25 hours the first semester and 24 hours the second. Our present program calls for 44 hours the first semester and 43 hours the second. Yet the teaching force is no greater than it was. Indeed in number of persons engaged in instruction it is less than it ever was; but the fact that all but one give substantially their whole time mal.es the result about the same as under the shorter schedule. As it now stands, one of the teaching staff giving but half his time, or six hours, there remain 38 hours of instruction and 11 hours of attendance upon practice courts to be apportioned among three pro - fessors. If borne equally, this would mean over 16 hours each. But it has not been possible to make an equal division, and the result has been that one has had to bear an almost intolerable burden. It is not possible to continue this condition. An adequate teaching staff is an immediate and imperative necessity. Provision should be made also for the courses in Public Law formerly given by Professor Cook. A great part of the work he was doing has had to be left in abeyance because there was no one to take it up. This work was of great importance, not only in the College of Law, but in the general colleges, and it would be most unfortunate to suffer it to be permanently discontinued. The University is to be con - gratulated upon securing Judge Hastings to take over the courses in Private Law formerly given by Professor Cook. It goes without saying that he has proved a notable accession to the faculty. His work is all that was to be expected from one of his eminence as a scholar and reputation as a lawyer. But Professor Cook was doing much more than one man's work, and we can not expect nis successor to carry the whole burden. The time has passed when it was necessary or advisable to have regular instruc - tion by members of the bar engaged in active practice. The demands of practice as well as the demands of proper teaching by modern methods are too exacting to permit of good results from such a combination. Never - theless, there are obvious advantages in bringing the student directly in contact with practitioners fresh from the office and the forum. If the active practitioner is too busy to do the hard work of regular instruction to the best advantage, he may nevertheless impart many things not to be </seg>
            <seg id="p041">41 learned from the books, which must be found out by experience or personal contact with those who know. For these reasons, a lecture course given by judges of the courts and members of the bar, dealing wholly with prac - tical subjects from the standpoint of the active practitioner, was begun last year as an experiment. The experiment appeared to show that good results would accrue from such a plan, and a regular lecture course, taking up one hour a week during the whole year, is now in operation. No money is available even to pay U.e expenses of the lecturers. But the bench and bar have been very generous in giving us gratuitous service of a high order. It Is to be hoped that funds will be available in the near future to enable us to pay the expenses of such lecturers. In the matter of entrance requirements, we are now abreast of the general run of good schools, requiring a full high school course of 28 points for admission, or the same requirement as for admission to the general colleges. I anticipate that this increased requirement will for a time reduce the attendance. But I do not regard such a result as in any - wise to be deplored. My belief is that the short course and low entrance requirements served in the past to swell the attendance beyond what we had any right to expect. Last year, with the requirement fixed at 24 points there were 183 students in attendance. Nearly half of these, how - ever, had been admitted under still lower requirements. This year, under a requirement of 28 points, I do not anticipate that the total enrollment will much exceed 150. Another year, with three full classes, it will un - doubtedly rise to the old figure. But, whatever reduction in numbers may result temporarily, the gain to the school and to the profession will more than compensate. A high school education today is within the reach of everyone. No one who is genuinely ambitious to enter and succeed in the profession need be deterred by this requirement. And the improvement in the quality of the students and the work done by them, already no - ticeable, is a gratifying testimony to the wisdom of the new standard. It would be ungrateful to close this report without testifying my deep obligation to Professor Cook, to whose zealous and intelligent support and assistance no small part of whatever has been achieved in the past year must be attributed. Respectfully submitted. ROSCOE POUND, Dean of the College of Law. REPORT UK THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE To the Cnancellor and Board of Regents: In this which constitutes my second biennial report as dean of the College of Medicine, I have the honor to report a successful continuance of the agreement entered into in May, 1902, by the terms of which the Omaha </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 Medical College became tne College of Medicine of the University &lt; braska. The plan has been in operation more than a full blennium, and the advantages offered are appealing to a steadily increasing circle of students, and this in spite of the considerable advance in entrance require - ments, which has put us in the front rank of western colleges of medicine. The enrollment stands as follows: 157 138 150 The reduced attendance in Omaha is due to the graduation of large rUmtm entered under more lenient standards, and the final abandonment of first and second year work. Under the terms of our agreement this work in Omaha was to have been discontinued on June 21, 1906; its volun - tary relinquishment in June, 1904, two years in advance of the time set, has assisted the University greatly in its effort to build up the strongest possible professional work in this department. This action was taken by the Omaha faculty in the face of a marked decline in the number of stu - dents, already brought on by other causes, and is an added evidence of the cordial co-operation of this faculty, as well as of their unswerving devotion to the highest ideals in medical education. The Omaha faculty has made another advance of great significance in organizing fully the system of sectional clinics which existed in less com - plete form. The older plan, still generally in vogue in medical schools elsewhere, of massing students in large clinics, where the power of tho individual student to observe accurately is greatly reduced, has been abondoned in favor of grouping classes into small sections and assigning these to different clinics. This plan is possible only because of the wealth of clinical material in reach of the College, and the number of clinical teachers on this faculty, it brings the individual student in intimate touch with the instructor and with the disease, and gains for him the advantage of individual instruction under conditions best calculated to bring out the essential points and to develop in him a diagnostic power and operative efficiency which are essential to his professional success. It embodies thus almost an ideal condition in medical teaching, and in the organization of the plan the Omaha faculty has given further evidence of their broad grasp of the situation and their desire to achieve with a limited product the highest possible results in the training of medical students without regard to sacrifice in number of students and to the expenditure of their own time and energy that these results may be obtained. After extended study of the question, and careful discussion, the medi - cal faculty has prepared certain recommendations regarding courses of study, which are transmitted to the Regents at this time, and which will distinctly strengthen the course as it now stands. I may be permitted u&gt; call attention to the importance of strengthening our work along the 1901-2. 1902-3. 1903-4. Lincoln 45 65 92 Omaha 112 73 58 </seg>

Among the most prominent of the needs of the College is certainly some increase in the teaching force, which is justified by the constantly increasing numbers of students. The demands of the work are such that one can not hope to provide permanently for the students under condi - tions which have existe . this year. They have proved to be too great a strain upon our teachers, and have been endured without complaint becMM of the impossibility of immediate adjustment. The equipment of the College has also failed to keep pace with the increase in numbers, and should be the subject of careful consideration in making estimates for the coming year. But of all features demanding attention, the amount of room available for carrying on this work has proved most insufficient. The work of the College has fallen particularly heavily upon one or two departments, and subjects which constitute else - where independent departments, have still continued to hold here their historic connection with the field of work from which they have been an outgrowth. It is unjust both to instructor and 3tudent that the w&lt; I : be continued without giving individual quarters to these separate branches. The present condition has been recognized as temporary, and endured patiently in the hope of an early relief. It constitutes a real ground for criticism on our work and should not be permitted to endure. It is furthermore doubtful whether the instructors will be willing to attempt to continue another year under the present conditions. That their feeling in the matter is justified, may be inferred from the fact that at least three separate subjects, which are recognized with individual quarters, or separate buildings, in western schools of no greater attendance or higher rank than our own, have been lorced to endeavor to compress their work within the limits of a single laboratory. The confusion, the extra work involved, the destruction of apparatus, and the inevitable shortcomings iu instruction, are radical defects in our present system. Respectfully submitted, H. B. WARD, Dean of the College of Medicine. REPORT OF THE ASSOCIATE DEAN IN CHARGE OF AGRICULTURE To the ChawxUor and Board of Regents: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the organization and work of agriculture in the University: Agricultural work in che University is divided into departments of instruction, represented by the Industrial College and the School of Agri- </seg>
            <seg id="p044">44 ■ire; of investigation, represented by tue Experiment Station ■ . a substation farm at North Platte; pnd of extension, represented by Farmers' Institutes. The facilities for instruction have been increased during the current biennium by the erection of buildings as follows: A building for the School of Agriculture, costing $60,000, and not yet complete; a building for farm engineering, costing $13,000; a dairy barn and stock judging pa - vilion, costing $11,000; a horticultural laboratory and green house, costing .m.OOO; and additions to the boiler house and heating system. These several improvements, costing approximately $100,000, will give a greater impetus to the extension of agricultural education than it has hitherto received at the hands of the taxpayers of the State. With the addition of equipment which is sure to follow, it will be possible for the Universitv to offer opportunities for instruction to farmers and their sons upon a scale never before possible. Especially has this development taken place in the School of Agri - culture, which is purely an agricultural high school, in which courses are planned to fit the boy who comes from the farm with such education as he can secure in the country school. These young men are given practical instruction in farm methods, with such instruction in the elementary allied sciences — botany, zoology, chemistry, physics, and mechanics— as will enable them to understand the scientific principles involved in the best farm practice. These courses cover three years, beginning in No - vember, when the rush of farm work is over, and closing in April, before the busy season of the farm is open. Shorter courses are also offered for men too busy to spend six month3 away from farm work. This instruc - tion reaches directly the rising generation of farmers and is sure to have a profound influence for good on the agricultural practice of the The development of the experimental work In the Station has been satisfactory. During the past biennium, especially valuable feeding experi - ment have been carried on to determine the kind of rations most profit - able in fattening steers, reported in Bulletin No. S5, and the value of alfalfa as a ration for swine, reported in Press Bulletin No. 20. I he cause of death of cattle eating stunted sorghum was discovered r Station to be a development of prussic acid in the plant in quan - fatal to the life of cattle eating only a small amount of sorghum, was the first discovery of free prussic acid In plants, the discovery made difficult on account of the unstable character of the compound, l readily decomposes into other compounds. Co-operative experiments with 1,700 farmers are being carried on to teat the adaptability of grains and forage crops to different sections of the State, thus securing results adapted to sections having different natural conditions. Numerous other experiments carried on are reported in current </seg>
            <seg id="p045">45 The great diversity of our natural conditions resulted in the passa«r. by the legislature of 1903, of an act establishing a substation west of the one hundredth meridian, to be located by and be under the direction of the Regents of the University. 1-ifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) was appropriated for this purpose. A committee appointed by the Regents, after considering many sites available, recommended to the Board of Regents the acceptance of a proposition tendered by the business men of North Platte, offering title to a most desirable location consisting of three (3) sections of land lying four miles south of North Platte, for a sum approximately $8,500, the citizens' committee having raised a similar amount to assist in the purchase of this tract. This farm is admirably adapted naturally for expert -nental purposes. It lies partly in the South Platte valley and partly upo i the high table and bluffs adjoining the valley. Most of this table is rough pasture land, but a sufficient amount for experimental crops is level, with an ele of about 3,000 feet above sea level and comparable in conditions with sands of square miles of land upon which the problems of successful culti - vation are still unsolved, i^is farm contained, when purchased, se acres of alfalfa in the valley and twenty acres upon the table-land. I one hundred twenty acres of the land had been cropped for a series of years witb different degrees of success. Some of this land had been aban - doned, while other parts had been successfully cultivated. Khis farm was purchased by the citizens' committee from five diff - «, all the land being necessary in order to form a compact body, of it was in a bad state of cultivation and all its fences were poor, itained no building of any value, although two small houses were on ind and a barn which has served as a temporary shelter for hones. Segotiations were completed so that the Regents secured possession s land, March. 1904, under conditions which left a sum of abo&gt; ind dollars with which to equip and operate the farm for the current 'i his was not sufficient to erect buildings and to cultivate the land. Knder these conditions it was considered more important to carry on work in crop production as was possible and to leave the er ngs subject to appropriations for this purpose from the Legislature. Generous appropriations for buildings could be used to great advan' The least which should possibly be done to make this work effective will be to erect a house for the superintendent, who must live on the farm, a house in which the foreman and his help can live, a barn and seed room, for horses and experimental grains, and some small improvements to shelter cattle and swine under experiment. Fifteen hundred acres of re are available for experiments in grazing. Stock enough should be supplied to utilize this grass and provide animals for experiment, and teams enough to carry on the experimental work. Not less than $1 should be provided for buildings and live stock, and $10,000 for mainte - e and general improvements. </seg>

In addition to his duties as teacher and experimenter the head of a depart - ment is often required to spend several hours per day answering corres - pondence. This correspondence amounts for all departments to about 15,000 letters per year. When added to this we consider the labor of issuing and mailing out nearly 150,000 bulletins and the labor of keeping experimental records, the necessity for a larg« force of clerks and stenog - raphers is apparent and the growing demands on the Station continually Increase this necessity. It present the regular Experiment Station work is supported almost y by United States Government funds, and the Substation by State ipriation, the former receiving of course much assistance in matters illdinga and equipment through its connection with the agricultural of the University and suffering somewhat from the fact that men from Station funds must teach in the College. There is a great demand for the extension of experimental work, es - pecially the co-operative experiments with grain and live stock; also for the ujscovery of remedies for suca plant diseases as cherry rust, leaf blight in apples, and the several rusts affecting small grain. If this work is to be undertaken on a scale commensurate with its importance, state appro - priations must be made for the purpose. It will not be sufficient that a single appropriation for a biennium be made, but the state must undertake a well-defined policy of agricultural investigation, as a matter of business, with the expectation of carrying it on from year to year, and depending on the benefits of these experiments to the entire commonwealth as a justification of the expenditure. Through the Farmers' Institute the results of agricultural investigation and knowledge is carried to the people. This personal contact with the people is the most effective way to spread information which will benefit farm practice. It is also the most effective way to teach the experimenter the needs of the people and lead him to shape his experiments so that the results will answer the Questions which the farmer asks. Ninety-two Institutes were held during the season of 1903-4. An equal number will be held in 1904-5. Of these, forty-three were one-day meetings. Kelve thousand dollars was appropriated for this work during the biennium. Institutes were held In fifty-seven counties. Ten men connected with the University did Institute work. Fourteen other lecturers were, employed. No additional salaries are paid to men connected with the University, who receive only their actual expenses while In the field. </seg>

BURNETT, Associate Dean in Charge of Agriculture REPORT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE To the Chancellor and Hoard of Regents: In my last report I called attention to the fact that the three years' course in the school of agriculture had undergone a radical change; that a prominent feature of the course is the instruction offered in agriculture and the subjects relating thereto. A course marked by such an amount of technical work is not in existence in any other school in the country. Usually about one-fourth of a college course in agriculture consists of pure agriculture and the subjects relating directly thereto. In the school of agriculture as now organized 1087 hours are given such instruction. This is more 'han one-half of an ordinary college course. I lie attendance in the three years' course has increased one hundred ent since my last report was made. Last year there were 112 students :ered of whom sixteen received certificates for completing the work, year the registration has already reached 125 and will probably mount &gt; before the close of tne year. The graduating class this year numbers udents. Everything points to a class of 50 young men in 1906. The years' course for a long time did not register as many students as inter course. It is gratifying to note that the number of students in tiree years' course last year exceeded that in any other course offered. The winter course continues to be an attractive one for men who have but a few weeks each year during which they may attend school. Last year the registration in the winter course was 98. This year the number prom - isee to exceed that of last year. The Judging course was offered, for the first time, in 1903. It hat proved exceedingly popular because it affords men who can tale but a </seg>

Since my last report the new Horticultural building has been erected and the Shop building erected and equipped. Because of the facilities afforded by the shop building we are now able to offer instruction in farm machinery — instruction very much in demand among the farmers of the state and very closely related to industrial progress. -he department of dairy husbandry which formerly had but two rooms at its -disposal is now in possession of every room of the dairy </seg>

The increased facilities for instruction in this depart - ment are already making themselves felt in the excellent work now being I lie department of dairy husbandry and the department of animal indry have also been provided with a barn for dairy stock and a stock ng pavilion. This makes it possible for our students to have the be«t tunities in the judging of horses and beef cattle. At the present the buildings are much crowded but with the completion of the build - iven by the last legislature the school will be in possession of com - jus but not altogether adequate quarters. some changes in the corps of instructors have taken place: Mr. John L. Sheldon of the department of botany resigned in May, 1903, and his place is now being supplied by i.ir. Homer L. Shantz. Mr. A. T. Wiancho resigned in January, liRM, to accept a position as associate professor in Purdue University; Mr. Alvin Keyser and Mr. E. G. Montgomery were in charge of his work last year and gave very acceptable service. Tue faculty has been greatly strengthened by the appointment of Professor Samuel Avery to the position of agricultural chemist and by Mis* Flora Bullock having been placed in charge of the work in English. Mr. Jay B. Davidson's appointment as instructor in shop work and farm machinery promises much for the instruction in those subjects. In the last report attention was called to the fact that our student* returned to the farms after finishing their course with us. This continues and it is gratifying to say that of the 975 students who have at various times been registered, 925 are on farms of Nebraska. Our students are much sought after by those who are extensively engaged in farming and in stock raising as managers for these enterprises. It is believed that our work is growing in favor among the farmers of the state and that it is producing a beneficial effect upon the agricultural industries of the state. The real purpose of agricultural education, increased productiveness of our farms and the creation of such a feeling among our farmers that they may deem their calling to be worthy of the best preparation and of talents of the highest order is being accomplished by the school. With the gen - erous support given by our legislators in the past and which may be de - pended on for the future, Nebraska may confidently hope for a place of the first order in training men for agricultural pursuits.

            <seg id="p050">50 OF THK DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL OF DOMESTIC SCIENCE To the Chancellor and Board of Regents: Ering the last biennium the energy of the teaching force of the of Domestic Science has been mainly expended In strengthening the i already in the calendar. Little new work has been undertaken 3 of the cramped quarters in which we are housed. I hope to offer new courses as soon as room is provided. Considerable progress has been made in raising the standard of schol - arship in our department This has been possible, because of the increas - ing proportion of fully prepared college students who are registering for the courses in Domestic Science. Because persons who are not prepared to enter the University as college students may enter the School of Do - mestice Science, we have since the organization of the School had a con - siderable number of students who were not able to reach the standards of scholarship which we are striving to maintain in the department. The proportion of this class of students has been gradually growing less as our work Is becoming better known among college women. Tne number of poorly prepared students entering the School of Domestic Science has happily decreased. Girls have found out that the School is not an easy stepping stone by which poorly prepared students may enter the University. One new line of work which has been introduced in this department during the last biennium is a training class for teachers. Including the students who have registered this fall there have been twenty women who have undertaken this work. They have had their practice teaching as assistants in our own laboratories and as teachers of cookery without pay, in the public schools of Lincoln. During the last two years we have had no considerable increase in numbers, but we have grown in strength and in power to do. The outlook for the future is encouraging and I believe that we shall grow in numbers as toon as we shall have room so that we may enlarge our work. Respectfully submitted, ROSA BOUTON, Director of the School of Domestic Science. REPORT OF THF.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL OF MECHANIC ARTS To the i hanoeUor and i.oard of RegenU: The crowded condition of the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and of Mechanical Drawing and Machine Design, together with the lack of sufficient assistance, has made inexpedient any attempts to extend the usefulness of the School of Mechanic Arts during the past two years. In the shops we are unable to accommodate all of the regular engineering students, and the drawing rooms are altogether inadequate for present needs. The short course in mechanic arts was arranged to accommodate students who are unprepared to enter, or who had not the time to complete one of the regular engineering courses. It was expected that this work should be done without encroaching upon the higher work. ihat the work of the school is of value and is in demand there is no doubt, as is attested by the character of the students in attendance in the past, and by the work done by them after leaving school. With increased facilities for instruction, the usefulness of the school could be extended. However, considering present conditions, it is a grave question whether it is not wiser to abandon the work of the school unless it can be </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 To provide for this work it is necessary that there be a largely In - creased shop and drawing room equipment, with a corps of competent instructors to take charge of the several technical and general subjects taught In particular it is important that permanent instructors in math - ematics and English be provided. In English a new instructor has been assigned each year, and in consequence there has been no continuity of work or method and much of the instruction has been of little use to these rliwrin While better instruction has been provided in mathematics than in English the work could be improved if one capable instructor were placed in charge of the work of both years. It is to be hoped that in the near future some of the work in the second year of the course may be made elective, in order that the require - ments of the students may be more fully met. Respectfully submitted. C. R. RICHARDS, Director of the School of Mechanic Arts.

Without endowment or financial assist - from the University in any way it has steadily increased in numbers sfflciency. Beginning with a very limited patronage it will this year 1 more than four hundred. The number in attendance during the ding four years is as follows: 1900-1, 285; 1901-2, 310; 1902-3, 340; 1, 360.

The school aims to educate teachers of music, and it annually sends forth competent instructors, who are influencing the younger generation in a remarkable manner in all that helps to create a strong sentiment for the highest forms of music. Only minor changes have taken place in the personnel of the faculty during the last two years, and the in all departments has been uninterrupted. Eipils have been enrolled from fourteen states.

Respectfully submitted, WILLARD KIMBALL, Director of the University School of Music REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN To the Chancellor and Board of Regents: Ke following report touches the condition and work of the library the biennium ending Nov. 30, 1904: The bound volumes added to the library during each of the past five years ending on Nov. 1, are as follows: DATE BT PURCHASE BY GIFT TOTAL 17158 From these figures it will be seen that our accessions by purchase during the past year have fallen off over 400 volumes from 1903 and are over 700 less than 5 years ago. This means of course, that our appro - priation for books not only is not increasing in proportion to the growth and development of the University but is actually less than five years ago. In twenty-six departments of instruction shared the library book fund. In the next five years eleven new departments were added to the list but the book fund instead of being increased by one-third was reduced, so that now. even if our appropriation were the same as five years ago, each department would receive but $2.70 of each $100 available instead of $3.84 five years ago. Thus the constant creation of new departments, without correspondingly increasing the money for books, works a hard - ship on every existing department. It was hoped that the library fee first collected in September, 1903, would increase our revenue and the new fee did indeed produce about $1,500 during the year but since the above date the Regents have failed to make the customary annual grant of $2,000 supplementing our permanent revenue, so that the net result of the new fee was a loss of revenue to the library. The earnest attention of your honorable board is asked to this condition, to the end that the work both of new and of old departments may not longer be seriously hindered for lack of necessary books. The organization of the University Library definitely recognizes th«! departmental system for the pure and applied sciences. 901 002 908 am 80:* 3793 am .-,38 788 5400 8575 4575 904 </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 Eie policy of the library board does not carry the subdivision so far permit a separate collection in every department of instruction but to group the libraries of related subjects. There are now fewer te libraries than five years ago and further consolidations are in 'ct when the Physics building is occupied. The logical and effective administration of this system requires expert library assistance at each departmental library. For ten years these departmental libraries have been jointly administered by the librarian and the departments concerned, the work being so divided that the library buys the books, classifies and catalogs them, places them on the shelves and takes an annual inventory; leaving to the department all responsibility for safety of the books, supervision of reading-room, circu - lation and the maintenance of accurate shelf arrangment. The experience of these ten years shows that even the best departmental administration of its library leaves much to be desired while the average conduct of the libraries by the departments concerned wastes the time of members of the faculty and students in random and often fruitless search for books, is notoriously careless in the care of the books themselves and is certain to drift into such undue freedom and informality in the borrowing and lending of books and periodicals outside the library and off the campus, as often results in embarrassment and actual loss. I he library board recommends that suitable provision be made by honorable board, in accordance with details which will be submitted u at an early meeting, for a closer library supervision and adminis - n of the departmental libraries, which shall contemplate, as soon as s may permit, the installation of a library assistant at every depart - il library. The efficiency of a system of departmental libraries will be greatly increased if all of them are in instant touch with the central building. This will facilitate quick use of books now but tardily accessible and will do much to unify the scattered collections for purposes of use and ad - ministration. The library board recommends that in planning the new telephone system a booth be placed in each departmental library, especially those at the State Farm, the College of Law, the Mechanic Arts building and the Physics building. The accessions of the past biennium have filled all our present shelf-room. When our book-room was built in 1895 it was made high enough to permit a glass floor over the present story of shelves and a second similar story of Bhelves to be placed thereon. This must now be done and as it is a permanent addition to our book capacity it must be of modern steel construction. ■ The new library room at the State Farm, which will be occupied during coming year must first be suitably fitted with shelving. ■For these two pressing matters the sum of $10,000 will be required the library board will submit details at an early date. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">55 Ee University Library welcomes all opportunities to make its books sources useful to the people of the State and this outside use has a great increase during the past two years. Ee members of our staff are constantly called upon to serve a large 1 public representing not only citizens of Lincoln but students, rs and readers from all over the state while the reference use of the • by mail is far greater than ever before. I 'he library is not only the largest in the state but within a radius of ' hundred miles there is no larger general reference library and this naturally creates an obligation which is always met to the fullest t that will not conflict with the claims of our immediate constituency. The routine work of the library has proceeded without unusual inci - dent or interruption during the past two years. The reading room service at the central building has been improved whenever possible, especially by a greater duplication of the leading books of required reading and by the perfection of the plan for "Reserved Books." The seating capacity of the central reading room is very often insufficient and the acquisition of the History Seminary room (L206) would relieve this pressure if the latter could be located elsewhere. The staff of the library has done zealous and faithful work which merits better pay; the manifold relations neces - sarily close, with the other departments of the University have beea uniformly pleasant and satisfactory and the great, the almost ravenous use of the library for fourteen hours uaily by hundreds of students seems to testify to its appreciation. Respectfully submitted, J. I. WYER, JR., Librarian REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF HIGH SCHOOLS To the Chancellor and Board of Regent*: Permit me in making my fourth biennial report to review briefly the work of the past seven years, and to call your attention to the policy that has been observed. The work of inspection formerly done by members of the faculty was placed in the hands of an inspector in 1897. The mem - bers of the faculty were anxious to have an inspector for the reason that they had neither the time nor the desire to inspect schools in addition to their other work. Public school men insisted on having this work done by one person in order to have a more uniform standard of inspection. The very pleasant relations that had existed between the University and the public schools a few years before were giving away to friction in many Chancellor Canfleld had pleased the people of the state with the doctrine that the University was a part of the public school system and that as it contained the last four of the sixteen years' course, its work </seg>
            <seg id="p056">\ 56 should be adjusted to the grades below. The idea commended itself to public school men and gained their enthusiastic support for the Uni - versity. This interest in the University continued for a time but finally, observing that no essential changes bad been made by the faculty in University courses or in entrance requirements carrying out the public school policy announced over the state by Chancellor Canfleld and his successor, school men began to question the sincerity of the University in this matter and to find fault with the method of dealing with the schools. At the time of the appointment of the inspector fully half of the leac ing superintendents of the state were in a more or less rebellious stat of mind towards the University. The condition was considered alarmin by those who understood and appreciated fully the situation. The Un: versity had lost the confidence of a number of the leading educators t such a degree that it was not certain that complete harmony with th high schools could be brought about. There were men who were friendl to the University as an institution who had taken offense at what was termed University dominition and University dictation. These men, som of them our own University graduates, claimed that University professors though knowing nothing of high school conditions, assumed to dictate what subjects should be taught in the schools, how much time should be given to each subject, how much ground should be covered in that time, and the way in which the subject should be taught. It was claimed that impractical directions had been sent to the board of education by members of the faculty which had proved embarrassing to the superintendent. There is but little doubt that certain departments had been over insistent on having their subjects taught in a particular way even to the point of refusing to allow credit for work done in any other way. But that was far from being the real policy of the University. In many instances what was meant only as a suggestion was taken by the schools as a demand. The inspector was told by the Chancellor and the Regents to make a careful study of the situation and to apply his own solution for the difficulties, striving to harmonize the University and th high schools and weld the two parts into one system of schools in actua work, as well as in theory. The action of the faculty soon after this, i conforming entrance requirements more nearly to what was actually don in the high schools rather than to what was required for entrance to othe colleges, was an important step, important because it carried out the re lation that ought to exist between the two parts of the system and import ant in that it was positive proof that the University had confidence in th high schools and in the work of superintendents and principals in planning their courses of study. I lie policy of the inspector and of the chancellors of the University l this time has been to bring about a closer organic connection be - the University and the other public schools and to bring about a understanding between the professors and superintendents. We taken the view that the University is a part of the public school a and can only advance as it takes the rest of the system with it </seg>
            <seg id="p057">57 Just as the University pulls away from its connections below by entrance requirements, so far it fails in performing the mission for which it was established and for which it is maintained. If the high schools can not come up to the University, it must go down to the high schools and draw them up and with them the grades below the high school. It can not exist as an endowed institution usually does for the exceptionally gifted, ex - ceptionally trained, or the exceptionally rich. It must meet the schools and serve all who come up through them. The University has on several occasions taken action increasing the minimum entrance requirements so as not to admit students below the Freshman year. Each time the pres - sure has come either from school men or from members of the legislature forcing the rule into disuse. No such rule can be effective until i tions in the state warrant it. The standard which must be observed in accrediting schools is baaed on the same principle, that of accommodating the schools of the state To school men in the eastern part of the state and possibly to many pro - fessors the present standard seems low, but it can be raised scarcely any without breaking the connections between the University and the best schools in certain portions of the state. If the minimum number of points for an accredited school should be increased by three or four points, Craw - ford, Chadron, and Valentine, all good schools, would be forced off the list of accredited schools and the boys and girls of the entire northwest portion of the state left with no way of reaching the University except through private schools. The present standard permits high schools carrying three full yean of high school work in a satisfactory manner to have a place on the list. There has been some discussion as to the advisability of limiting the list to four year high schools. Under no circumstances should that be done. The effect would be disastrous. It would increase the number of top heavy courses of study and thus weaken the work of the schools. Better accredit three year schools and devise some way of influencing fully half the schools now carrying four years to carry only three. Such a step would show marked improvement in the attainment of pupils coming to the University from smaller high schools. The mater of dropping a school from the accredited list has proved so serious that schools having accidentally dropped below minimum require - ments, have often been given one or even two years in which to bring their work up to the required standard. The effect of dropping a school from the list is much the same on the school as that of expelling a boy from school is on the boy. In almost every instance dropping a school from the list has left it not only without the uplifting influence that comes from a connection with higher institutions but entirely wanting in local interest and pride. Just as a school should be required to maintain a satisfactory standard for two or three years before being placed on the list, so should it be given ample time in which to recover from any temporary set-back. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 Et experience of the past seven years shows the wisdom of making ions to schools as suggestions rather than to put the same in the directions. The relations between the schools and the department iction have become such that practically every suggestion or recom - lon of the. inspector is acted upon favorably by the superintendent s board of education. There is a degree of harmony between the ity and its accredited schools that exists in no other state. This ■e University an opportunity to become more and more a factor in ing the efficiency of the public schools. Iie change of entrance requirements brings a great many worthy high graduates to this institution who otherwise would go elsewhere, cally every subject taught in the high school counts on entrance pments. The intention was to include every subject that ought to i high school course of study. The requirment of twenty-eight points iade so as to require four years' work for entrance to the Freshman The change also recognizes the elective principle in the high school. It is less than a step from the present system of entrance requirements to that of accepting a good four years high school course as full entrance to the University. Just as there are very few restrictions placed on the selection of subjects that lead to the bachelor's degree, so should there be few restrictions placed on high schools as to what should be in the course of study. It is perfectly safe to leave this whole matter with the schools, except as modifications are made as a result of suggestions, from the inspector. When the required work in Latin was decreased from four years to two, it was feared that Latin would lose ground in the public schools, but quite the opposite has been true. More Latin and better Latin is taught in high schools than was taught before the change. The high schools of the state are in safe hands and the more fully superintendents and principals are trusted by the University the better it is for both University and high schools. Why not accept, as full entrance, a four years' course in any good high school that contains the seventeen points now listed as required points? Then why not accept a three years' high school course in a like manner as entrance to within about twenty-eight hours (university hours) of full entrance? A record of subjects completed in the high school could be listed in the pass book as now to aid in registration but not to be con - sidered of special importance in the matter of entrance. That would simplify entrance still further. It would do away with the necessity of a great deal of unnecessary estimating and evaluating of credits except in the case of a few who come with a part of their preparation from one school and a part from another. Even in the exceptional cases, it would usually be just as safe to reduce to the basis of years as to reduce to the b— la of subjects and points. High schools have had a remarkable development during recent years. The growth has been so general over the state that even the University </seg>
            <seg id="p059">59 has not been aware of the actual sain from year to year. In comparing the work in our high schools with those of neighboring states, schools ia Nebraska towns having a population of 2,000 are stronger as a rule than the schools of towns in other states having a population of 3,000 or 3,500. In most other states now and then a school stands out but in this state the schools are uniformly good. This is because the schools are in close touch not only with the University but with each other, and because of the extraordinary enterprise on the part of the men in charge of the public schools o* the state. Kie laboratory and library equipment of the larger schools six or years ago was no better than the equipment of the smaller schools By comparing the weaker accredited schools of 1897 with the r schools of today you will be surprised at the growth that has been better equipment, better courses of study, better teachers and much results. I assure you that it is a pleasure in leaving the work of inspection to see it placed in the hands of one who will not only hold the gain already made but one who will put new life and energy into every phase of the work. Permit me to thank you all most sincerely for your kind and encouraging words during my term as inspector and for your best wishes chat have followed me into my new position. Respectfully submitted. J. W. CRABTREE, Inspector of High Schools. REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF ACCREDITED SCHOOLS To the Chancellor and Board of Regents: Khave the honor of submitting the following report supplementary to inexed report of my predecessor, Mr. J. W. Crabtree, of his work r September 1, 1904. I have no policy to announce save that of being of the utmost service possible in cementing into a still closer union the sixteen grades of the public school system of Nebraska. Ilnce September first, twenty-eight schools have been visited and ore are being guided through the stages of accreditment. This process its of a critical examination of the course of study with suggestions needed modifications, a detailed report from the school superintendent rary and scientific equipment and the educational qualifications of achers, a visit of inspection and conference with the school board and t the submission of all information to the committee on accredited is of the University with whom the decision lies. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">60 Believing that the number of accredited three-year schools should be extended my efforts this year will be chiefly devoted to this desired Ily the courtesy of the President of the Superintendents and Princi- Section of the Nebraska Teachers' Association, I was permitted to ire a program of addresses on University Inspection for the session last October. Many helpful suggestions resulted. To harmonize the ideals of the University and the possibilities of high school instruction and to promote a closer acquaintance between the Uni - sersity and high school men, I suggest a monthly news-letter devoted to secondary education and sent free to teachers and members of school If adequate room and care can be provided, an exhibit of secondary education will be of great assistance to the school men of the state. Such an exhibit should include the best text-books, scientific apparatus, maps, globes, fixtures, decorations and samples of the best forms of school reports. Such an exhibit would enable superintendents to make wiser selections of texts and materials and would be a working laboratory for the new principals who are graduated each year from the University. Both paper and exhibit were unanimously endorsed by the Superin - tendents and Principals' Section and both can be secured at small expense. The efficient and tactful work of Mr. Crabtree makes the duties of his successor unusually pleasant and inspiring. My pleasure in the work is still further enhanced by your generous recognition of the importance of this department in granting the present Inspector full professional rank. Respectfully submitted, T. M. HODGMAN, Inspector of Accredited Schools </seg>
