            <seg id="p031">ANNUAL MEETING Tuesday Forenoon, January 15, 1918. Meeting called to order by President R. F. Howard, who intro - duced Mayor J. E. Miller as the first speaker. Mayor Miller: Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen: I could enjoy the next few min - utes a good deal, I am sure, or if I could make it an hour, and sit here and ask you questions about the work you are doing. I have written what I wanted to say to you because I find that the less I know of a subject the more necessary it is to write it dowa, and if I do not have it written I know that I am apt to ramble and take too much time, and I do not believe that is a fault peculiar ot myself. I expect that I was invited to talk to you at this time be - cause you thought that there was no danger that I would "talk shop," and that is a fair and reasonable assumption, but I do claim an intense interest in the subject of horticulture. My friends among you who know how closely I have devoted the last forty-five years to another business would not suspect that the first fifteen were de - voted to horticulture. One of my earliest recollections is that of holding apple and pear trees for my father while he carefully spread out every root and planted each tree firmly in tthe ground. As soon as I was old enough to handle the trowel it was my duty to tend them with hand and hoe, and to gather both fruits and vegetables. Be - cause I was not strong enough to do heavy work, the lighter work fell to me. While the other boys of our family were driving the teams I was quite content to handle the hoe. In the face of the fact that almost every boy I know hates the sight of the hoe, I am going to claim boldly that I always liked it, and like it ret. I come from a family of horticulturists, three of my father's brothers having devoted most of their lives to raising trees and fruits. One of these uncles was not without distinction for the production of new varieties of fruits. His work would have attracted more attention if he had done more advertising. The President of the pres - ent American Civic Association said to me not many years ago that David Miller if he had been as good at advertising as Burbank would have been just as good an agriculturist. But all this is only to let you know that I came honestly by my taste for the work that you are doing and my appreciation of the problems which you have t« meet. Mr. Chapin knows that during this spring and summer I find the pruining knives and spade very good substitutes for the golf clubs in which my friends take such great delight. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY I remember very clearly looking out of the window one balmy spring afternoon upon a pear orchard, and the impression made on my mind by that sight has never left me. I have travelled about a good deal since that time but nothing I have seen in the tropics or elsewhere has made such an impression as that blossoming orchard with its background of blue grass. I can understand the pleasnrp of the stock man in caring for his herds, seeing them increase in size and in quality, aid the pleasure the farmer finds in plowing, sowing and reaping the farm crops. Their pleasure and satisfaction are of the same character as that which the business or professional man find in enthusiastic and successful work. Indeed, I think all honest men take pride in their work whatever it may chance to be. I profoundly pity a man who finds the work he has chosen or that he is forced to. mere drudgery; and I know that if he were right-minded his burdens would become a source of pleas - ure. But the satisfaction which the farmer, the business man or the professional man finds in his chosen work is nothing to the keen de - lights of the horticulturist. The true horticulturist gets close to his work; he touches and handles in an intimate way the delicate seeds, cuttings and plants. His work to be successful must be orderly and careful. It is right and proper that the man who supplies the mar - kets with attractive fruits should find profit in producing them, but find better pleasure in the closer touch with nature, in producing something beautiful as well as useful. My uncle spent all the years of his long life in producing fruits, making little more than a living. I visited him when he was more than seventy years of age. I remember he brought a beautiful apple to me and said to me with a good deal of pride in his voice, "John here is a sample of the only apple that I have ever succeeded in de - veloping that I can call valuable." I don't know whether he ever gave that apple a name, but I do remember the enthusiasm and pleas - ure he had over having produced something that was worth while. Just a word on the more practical side of your calling. People generally are only begining to appreciate the things that you pro - duce. Meat and bread have been and will continue to be the es - sentials, although Just now we are learning through necessity to get along with a smaller supply; but aside from the change of diet forced upon us by the war, we are learning to understand more fully the value upon our tables of the vegetables and fruits which can be produced in such great variety and abundance. What should we have on our dining table that our appetites may be tempted and our digestion not impaired? A dainty cloth, dainty china and a bunch of flowers, appropriate meat and vegetables and an abundance of fruit. The best are the products of the horticul - turist. The extent to which they will be used will depend largely </seg>
            <seg id="p033">PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS 33 upon your skill and energy in producing them and in carrying on a serious campaign to demonstrate their value. Every subject I see on this program which you propose to dis - cuss is of great interest to me, and I wish very much that I could at - tend every section. Just now the City of Lincoln has a problem of interest to you. Our shade trees are threatened by the Tussock moth, which did very great damage last season. This moth would not be so unpopular if he would destroy only those trees which are less desirable, but unfor - tunately his taste calls for the best and not the poorest trees. At the suggestion of Professor Swenk of the Department of Entomology, the city authorities will have the trees sprayed next spring and summer. We hope to make this the first step toward the complete control by the city authorities of all our street trees. Before closing may I be permitted a few words on the one sub - ject in which we are all interested, almost to the exclusion of every other? We are in a war which again and again has been declared to be tbr greatest conflict of history. We are in this war for no selfish purpose. Our president has declared, and patriotic citizens have agreed, that we are fighting to make the world safe for democracy. With full faith in our honesty of purpose, and with every confidence in our power, I am sure we will agree that we are in the war to win, and that each of us will do all in his power to hasten the end. PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS. It. F. Howard. It is usually customary for the President in his annual remarks to broadly outline the purpose of the organization, to give the suc - cessive steps by which it has accomplished certain things, and to per - haps suggest a program for the future. I shall not, however, in my brief remarks, attempt to give you a history of the State Horticulture Society and its work, other than to say it stands for all things progres - sive along Horticulture lines. It is ready at all times to assist in any way it can to promote Horticulture in Nebraska. I shall have two or three suggestions to make during the course of my remarks which, in my opinion, represent some of the problems that should be kept prominently in mind by the Society. As a part of the national movement to produce a maximum of food products, this Society can play a prominent part. We can, and should in every way possible, increase home gardening in its broad - est sense. We should, through the public press, in the various com - munities we represent, cause information to be published that will </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY enable the city dweller as well as the farmer, to grow enough veg - etables for his own use. We should feature through the columns of our magazine this coming year, information on how to properly can, dry and store in the fresh state for winter use, all the .'hings that can be grown in the garden. The significance and importance of this was impressed upon me recently when I had the privilege of attending a meeting in Omaha where the State Food Administrator was given instructions to the County Food Administrators of the State. It was pointed out that we as a nation had by November 1st exported such large quantities of beef, pork, wheat and fats that we would un - der normal conditions have said to the other nations at that time that we would require the remainder for our own use. Instead of saying this, conditions were such as to demand that we continue to draw upon our supply in order to feed our armies, the armies of our allies, and to prevent the civilian population of certain devastated regions of Europe from actually starving. There was only one way by which we could continue to export staples from a supply that would normally be only enough for our own use and that one way was to not eat it our - selves. The wheatless and meatless days no doubt have had and are having a tremendous influence in making it possible for us to do this until we can produce another crop. The point I am trying to make is this — We as Horticulturists can not and should not change about and begin raising wheat and hogs. We can do our part in helping the food situation during the war by practicing the things for which we are trained. The people of the United States are fast learning that they can live just as well and perhaps longer, if they eat less meat, less wheat flour bread and sub - stitute more well chosen vegetables, dairy products, eggs, poultry and fruit. Our problem, then, is to see that the public is properly instructed on how to grow and utilize Horticultural crops in order that we may be able to continue to export these concentrated foods so badly needed by our armies abroad. I would also make a plea for a greater effort on our part to utilize the cull and windfall apples from our orchards. In many instances this is done by the commercial orchards, but there are thousands of bushels of apples that rot on the ground each year in Eastern Nebraska. There will be dozens of community drying plants established next summer in the small towns of Eastern Ne - braska. These drying plants can utilize all culls, windfalls and ap - ples otherwise blemished if they can only get them. These plants for the most part will not be operated for profit, but as community en - terprises. Let us remember then, if we have fruit that we our - selves will not use, it can be made to serve a good purpose by putting it Into the hands of the people operating these community dryers. Hord - ing certain food products is now a crime punishable by fine or im - prisonment, yet to my mind hoarding is not much worse than a use - lew waste of food matter. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">PRESIDENT'S ADDKESS 35 I would emphasize then, that as a war measure the society lend a helping hand particularly during the period of the war, in educating the people to an appreciation of the home vegetable garden, to dis - seminate information which will enauble the amateur to properly use what he raises and to encourage any public movement that has as its object the utilization of surplus from the gardens and orchards. The Nebraska Horticulture Society has always taken an active interest in the orchard industry of the State. It has published in its annual reports and its magazine from year to year the progressive steps that have been made. It has taken advantage of the experiences of the oldest and best growers of the State, by recording these ex - periences in such a way that others may profit by them and yet avoid the mistakes that were made. Thisjin my opinion is one of the best lines of work the Society is engaged in. It is a perpetual State wide experiment. We should make every effort to keep our records on varietal adaptation, for the various parts of the State, up-to-date. It may be said without fear of contradiction that this Society has done a great work in helping to establish the fact that Eastern Nebraska possesses all the natural advantages necessary to a great commercial fruit growing section. It has been instrumental in determining the varieties best adapted to the region. These are commendable things, being fundamental to the fruit growing industry, but would it not be well for us to pause long enough to ask ourselves the question: Are we doing everything in our power to develop these fruit growing possi - bilities we know we possess? We are ourselves convinced that fruit growing in Eastern Nebraska from the standpoint of an investment. Is more attractive than it has ever been, but why are there not more commercial orchards being planted? Is it because the old neglected orchards along our highways, dead and dying from the ravages of dis - ease and insect pests, act as scarecrows, or is it because we have not done our part in convincing the people of the State that there are real opportunities in fruit growing? You say there are orchards being planted each year. To be sure there are some being planted, but I doubt if we have materially increased the acreage of commercial orchards in the State the past five years. It is an easy matter to criticize and to point out that a system is not working, but quite another matter to offer a really constructive suggestion for making the system work. This Society each year dem - onstrates through its exhibits that fruit of high quality can be grown here. It prints a monthly magazine giving information on how to grow fruit of high quality and yet I say we are not increasing the commercial orchard acreage of Nebraska one-fifth as fast as our con - ditions warrant. What is the reason for this? My observation in the State for the past nine years leads me to believe that we need more public demonstrations to show that orchard - ing is a profitable investment. We need one or more excellent com- </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY mercial orchards in each community to call the public's attention for - cibly to the fact that fruit growing is more profitable than ever be - fore. When we can show in the various communities of Eastern Ne - braska that a commercial apple orchard can be made to pay a reason - able rate of interest on the investment until it reaches bearing age, and can be made then to net from $50 to $100 per acre, we will have reached a point where interest in orchard planting will care for itself. This old world has too much concern for the dollar to not be inter - ested in fruit growing if we can show in a sufficient number of cases that orcharding is a highly profitable business. How then can these ideal profitable orchards be established in the various communities of our fruit growing section? In my opinion, the appropriation allowed in our last legislation, largely through the efforts of this Society, will enable us to make a step in this direction. I have reference to the State appropriation allowed for the purpose of establishing a demonstration orchard to be owned and operated by the State. The land selected for this fruit farm consists of 80 acres located about eleven miles north of Ne - braska City. It is in Cass County and borders Otoe on the South. This puts it approximately in the center of our commercial fruit growing section, north and south. The soil is the typical deep loess formation. Its location with respect to air drainage is excellent. The Kansas City- Omaha highway borders it on the west and it is within 1 milee of a shipping point. While it was necessary to use the entire appropria - tion for purchasing the land, it is to be hoped that sufficient money will be allowed to enable us to plant a 40 acre orchard on it next spring. With regard to the objects of this demonstration orchard, the following may be said: It will serve as the basis for specific informa - tion on orchard operations. At present we have no way of meeting this demand except to make general recommendations or to give figures taken in neighboring States, which may not in all cases apply to our own conditions. Such an orchard will furnish a means of collecting and disseminating reliable information. It will be a living example where everyone interested in fruit growing will be welcome at all times of the year. Accurate accounts will be kept from the beginning on the cost of all phases of orchard management. It will be made as nearly self-supporting as possible from the beginning by means of inter - cropping. This will be done however, only to an extent that is con - sistent with the best interests of the orchard trees. In planning this orchard, every effort will be made to profit by the experience of others. Some of the things that will be given careful consideration are: Size of orchard as a commercial unit. Air drainage. </seg>
            <seg id="p037">HORTICULTURAL OBSERVATIONS IN NEBRASKA 37 x Soil. Profitable varieties for Nebraska. Distance apart of rows and trees. Care of trees when young, with regard to heading, annual prun - ing, cultivation, food supply. If the things I have mentioned are all observed and the orchard is given the best of care from the beginning, we should have an orchard in years to come that will be an index to the possibilities of fruit growing in Eastern Nebraska. It should be made to serve aa the nucleus of interest in commercial fruit growing in the State. I would suggest that a report of progress be published each year in the annual report of this Society, setting forth the record of this orchard. I did not go into details regarding the planting and maintaining of this orchard, because they are not completed yet. I am sure that all the members of this Society are going to help with the manage - ment of this demonstration orchard and will be intensely interested in its progress. I hope to get most of my ideas from the men in this Society and from the men that have been doing things in fruit grow - ing in this State for forty years, in order that we may avoid all the mistakes that have been made by the men that have been in the horticultural work all their lives in this State. Chairman: The next topic on our program is "Horticultural Ob - servations in Nebraska," by Peter Youngers, of Gene/a. HORTICULTURAL. OBSERVATIONS IN NEBRASKA Peter Youngers Going back to the early days of 1871 the outlook was not prom - ising. Very few ventured to plant orchards, trees or shrubs, but the period of 1874 to 1880 a great many orchards and groves were planted and it was a hopeful sight when the young groves and orchards began to spring up in all parts of the state. From a vast, treeless plain to a land where orchards, groves, shrubs and small fruit plantations now abound. We as a state have made wonderful progress. It has been the writer's good fortune to witness the development of horticulture in Nebraska for 46 years, and often wondered If it would be possible to have such a change come over a state in a life - time. I remember when we met 35 years ago when we had such grand men to counsel with as J. Sterling Morton, R. W. Furnlss, J. H. Mas - ter, E. Beaver, S. Barnard, Isaac Pollard, W. J. Hesser, Alvin Saunders, and many more of the pioneers; when the growing of fruit was watched carefully and every variety was then on the trial list. How carefully </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY the men mentioned, recorded their successes and failures and pmnil it down to us bo we might profit by their successes and avoid their mistakes. These are all recorded in our horticulture reports, and in reading them over we find that the varieties that were recorded in 1871, only a very few are not considered worthy of cultivation. The varieties that have stood the test for forty years are Duchess, Wealthy, Winesap, Ben Davis, Jonathan, Grimes Golden, Missouri Pippin; all of the varieties mentioned have had the endorsement for forty years or over, and a very few of the other varieties mentioned in 1871 are now grown in a commercial way. But many new varieties give promise of becoming very valuable. One advantage that is often overlooked by many consumers of fruit, that is, the keeping qualities and the extra good flavor of the Nebraska fruit. The reason assigned for the extra keeping qualities are, first, soil perfectly adapted to producing choice fruit. The eastern portion of the state is blessed with the low - est soil that has all the elements necessary to produce the best quality. Second, the time of gathering, October and November, gives the apples time to color up properly and the weather is cool and the apple goes into storage much better, than where the same varieties are picked from two to four weeks earlier. I believe in a few years we will re - ceive wonderful accounts of large yields and choice fruit under irri - gation from western Nebraska. Already fine samples of fruit have been produced, and I hope to see the time when we will receive reports of carloads of fruit being shipped from the irrigated regions. I have secured a very incomplete record of the production of a few counties of the number of carloads shipped. When we consider that this has been an off year for the apples, we wonder what this section will do when we have a normal year. Washington County _ _ 120 carloads Case County _ _. 150 carloads Nemaha County 300 carloads Otoe County 200 carloads Richardson County _ _ _ 4 50 carloads Pawnee County _ _ „ 50 carloads Johnson County _ 20 carloads Total from six counties. 1,290 carloads or 74,000 bushels The Hunter Orchard, near Sutherland, Lincoln County, of 37 acres, produced 12,000 bushels the past season. The Moreland Orchard, near McCook, gave a large yield of fine fruit It would be a safe proposition to state that Nebraska produced one million bushels of apples in 1917. I have visited the orchard coun - tries of the East, West, Northwest and the South. The orchards of Colorado and Oregon, Idaho, and Washington. I have seen many </seg>

I had an interest in two orchards under irrigation in the Grand Valley In Colorado, but I never have seen as fine a sight as in the counties of Cass and Otoe, Nemaha and Richardson counties last October and November. Trees loaded with nice, uniform high-colored apples that would delight the eye of anyone interested in horticulture. The ad - vantages of the eastern portion of Nebraska as a fruit growing sec - tion are not yet realized by our people, and I predict the future of Nebraska will astonish the apple growers of the Union. The cli - mate, the soil, and the advantage of nearness to the market, will no doubt add to the rapid development of the apple industry. The over - head charges in the irrigated section and freight added would make the Nebraska grower a good profit if the fruit were sold at the price that the western growers would have to pay for the extra expense In growing and marketing the crop, and my observation, after nearly 4 6 years, would lead me to believe that Nebraska will be one of the best apple producing states in the Union. Discussion President Howard: We have all the time we need to enter Into an informal discussion of these papers or anything else you might care to discuss at this time, or any questions you care to ask that were not touched upon in these papers. Mayor Miller: I would like to ask Mr. Youngers, simply because I know nothing about it, whether southeastern Nebraska is better than southwestern Iowa or northeastern Kansas or northwestern Mis - souri for raising fruit, and if it is better, why it Is better. Mr. Youngers: All the sections of those four corners are practi - cally the same. I would not consider that we have much edge over them. Mayor Miller: How about Illinois and around there? Mr. Youngers. I understand that our fruit goes into cold storage and keeps better than theirs, and therefore commands a higher price. President Howard: I spent some years in the Ozark section of Missouri and I have been nine years in Nebraska. I have spent two years in Wisconsin and Michigan, and I have been in the Yakima and other Pacific Northwest fruit growing sections, and I would say that there are two or three advantages that Mr. Youngers overlooked that we have in the corners of these states and up the river to Omaha or north that certain other so-called intensive fruit growing sections do not possess. I have reference mainly to the time of ripening. Our fruit we pick after it is cool. The fruit matures in southern Missouri about three weeks before it does here. It probably will not stand up in storage nearly as long as ours. Then, too, there is the matter of </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY insect and disease pests. There are two or three of the worst fungus diseases that attack apples that we do not have to contend with. We may have to later on; I am not saying our section is immune from them. I have reference to the apple blotch mainly — that and the bit - ter rot and brown rot; three diseases that, while we have them as minor diseases in our state, they are not the severe pest that they are farther south and in other sections. Another point is the great opportunity that we have in having a consuming public around us. I was interested in questioning growers in the Yakima district. They tell me that it costs them fifty cents a bushel freight rates to place their fruit on the market. Well it is needless to say that that is easily a margin of profit or loss in the fruit business. Somewhere in a radius of six or six hundred miles of our fruit sections we have a consuming public to consume all the apples that can ever be grown there. That is a tremendous advantage, and there are no doubt other things in our favor. The cheapness of the land in the timbered sections of eastern Nebraska where land may yet be bought for from fifty to one hundred dollars per acre is much in our favor, and some of this land is the best fruit land we possess. We can get rich on land that can be bought for one hundred dollars, where a man handicapped fifty cents per bushel, plus the matter of paying interest on two thousand acres of land, would not make a success of it. Mr. Youngers: I have no doubt that you could write quite a more extensive paper on what I omitted than what I put into my paper. President Howard: Mr. Youngers, I assure you I was not saying that to call your attention to the fact that you had omitted some things in answering Mr. Miller, but to bring out a point which might be discussed quite freely by the Society. Mr. Evans, of Kenesaw: The Chai.rman knows, by reason of hav - ing visited the Moreland orchard last spring that the fruit country in this state is not entirely confined to the Missouri River counties. Of course we all know that that is the real fruit section of the state. At the same time, as Mr. Youngers has suggested, there are great possibilities of fruit growing in the irrigated regions of the western part of the state. The Moreland o chard — Mrs. Moreland being my sister I had occasion to help her ;. little along certain lines. The experience there proves that apple growing may be an important indus - try in the western part of the state where irrigation is possible, and I would suggest that the President's paper rather excluded considera - tion of everything except the real fruit section along the Missouri river. Now the activities of this Society could properly be extended to any portions of the state that may be made profitable fruit sec - tions. Another thing that occurred to me. At nearly all . our farms there is a little bunch of apple trees planted. Usually, I speak from my own experience, we let those trees be their own caretakers. Now It would be a perfectly legitimate effort of this Society to encourage </seg>
            <seg id="p043">43 those who have the little garden orchard to take proper care of those trees and by that means raise their own fruit and save the enormous charges that we have to pay for apples shipped in at this time of the year. It is true that in most of the farm orchards there is very little spraying and trimming done, and the usual care is not taken of those trees, and there have been enormous sums of money wasted In the ouying of tiees so planted and not being cared tor, and as a result very little sound fruit is gathered from them. Now in this conser - vation period that is one of the saving methods of the fruit trees. Nearly all of our farms that have twenty or thirty apple trees could raise in most years a large part of the fruit that they use — of the apples that they use, and also cherries and plums. Cherries and plums are much more certain fruit crops with us in the central south - ern part of Nebraska than are apples, and I think It would be very proper for this Society not to devote their entire consideration to the apple although it is the most important fruit that is bought, but the little cherry orchard and the little plum orchard can be made a very valuable adjunct of any farm; because they don't require the atten - tion and they are a much surer crop. The Moreland orchard this year, except for two hail storms, would probably have produced twelve thousand bushels of apples. As it was, it produced quite a considerable output, and I make the appeal that this Society should not confine itself to the region that grows its own apples, that is such a natural apple region that it ought to take care of itself largely, but to encourage the rest of us who have a harder proposition. Mr. Youngers: I will say that he has got the wrong impression about the Society and what it has been doing. Now if you would take a look at our report you would find that we have devoted our time, on an occasion lika this it would be apples, maybe another time It would be cherries and small fruits, etc. We have divided the state off into horticultural districts and recommend certain varieties to plant, and have really done a good work in that way even up south - west of Hay Springs. We have had splendid reports from there. We can grow apples and small fruits in every part of Nebraska but in some places more successfully than in others, and it has been the aim of this Society to do that kind of work. We have had meetings as far as Kearney, and we have had splendid meetings there, and I wish to say that we never could get the man that has the trees to do the spraying. The trouble is to get him to do it. Now for the expense of about fifteen dollars two or three orchardists would spray their orchards and save the fruit. If neighbors would only combine and put in five dollars in the pump and do their own spraying, if they would only do it. Mr. Val Keyser, of Nebraska City: I know Mr. Evans real well and I think he is wrong in his criticism of the Chairman. Here is the ides- </seg>
            <seg id="p044">44 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Apple (rowing and growing some other fruits are not alike. Apple growing is a little more technical piece of work. This Society aims to encourage the home orchards and expect to keep on that line, and they have had so much experience in trying to get everybody to grow fruit that they concluded a few years ago to make one section of the society devoted to commercial fruit growing, and that is what we are taking up today. If you want fruit so that you can have a little to eat you can grow your own, but if you are growing it for com - mercial purposes you will have to depend on that section that is espe - cially adapted for that to grow. I have argued this with Mr. Youngers. He says I have grown just as good fruit in Nebraska City as you can down in the other parts of the state. You can do that once in a while, but in the other part of the state you can get the crop every time. Now we have a section there that should be pushed for com - mercial apple growing, and I think the President is entirely right, bat I am just as much interested in seeing a little fruit plantation around every farm-house in the state of Nebraska and on every city lot as anyone is. I believe that is important. The nurserymen carry highly ornamentals and are not trying to push a large orchard to every farmer all over the state, because it don't pay. They don't take care of it and it is discouraging. I think the Chairman is exactly right in encouraging that section of the country for the com - mercial end of it. In the rest of the state where it is more difficult to grow those things it is an experiment, because anything that has five failures to one success is an experiment yet. You have got to have success year after year with only once in a while a failure. President Howard: I think that the exception that Mr. Evans took to my remarks were more nearly justified than Mr. Keyser will admit. I should have mentioned what is being done in central and western Nebraska in commercial orcharding in that address. I might say thou, Mr. Evans, that I had in mind calling the Society's attention to this commercial demonstration orchard that has been provided for by our legislature. I had in mind more than anything else mention - ing the purpose that it could serve, and in doing that I was naturally led to assemble my remarks as they pertained to the fruit growing industry of eastern Nebraska, but I admit that I should have made a separate paragraph and told what is being done as nearly as I could tell it, in central and western Nebraska. Now I had an opportunity last year to visit the Moreland orchard with Mr. Evans. I have told some of you men that in that orchard you will find some of the most beautiful trees that you can find any - where in the state. It is located in such a way that it can be irri - gated, is on good ground, and does not ever have to suffer from drouth, and is an ideal orchard. I think that Mr. Evans and I visited practically all of the orchards in the Platte and Republican Valleys that are of any size. I would say that they do have one one difficulty to </seg>
            <seg id="p045">45 contend with, and that is on account of having to plant them In the lowest land in order to overcome the moisture problem. Alar, they will always have to contend with the late spring frosts. That you can't get around, but in those years when you get a crop or when you get a half crop an orchard in that section would probably be aa profitable as the average orchard in eastern Nebraska, because you would not have to ship them so far to the consuming public. Aa orchard in Richardson County might compete with an orchard in Sutter and McCook so far as the consumers in that immediate vicinity are concerned. There should be, and will be, a large number of commercial orchards in central Nebraska and in western Nebraska; enough probably to take care of the commercial apples in their sec - tions. I hope to see that, but yet, Mr. Evans, I think strongly that we have certain climatic advantages. I have reference mainly to the late spring frosts and the hails in the west that will make it less safe as a commercial venture than in eastern Nebraska. But while I think that, there is no need calling the public's attention to it forcibly. I think there will be enough men interested in commercial orcharding in that section, and that they should be encouraged, but I doubt if this Society should make as big noise in trying to attract the public to plant thousands of acres as we are to make a big campaign and attempt to get thousands of acres planted in the river counties. As to what is being done by the Society and the Horticulture Department of the College, as far as the home orchard is concerned, I would say this: Our horticulture expert, Mr. Hoppert, who devotes all of his time to the horticulture interests of the state has done no experiment sta - tion work nor teaching work last year. He gave forty-five pruning demonstrations representing forty-five different communities. He showed them how to mix and apply spray material at spraying time. That represents forty-five communities all over Nebraska, (for the most part in the eastern half of Nebraska), but there were only a half dozen in the border counties. Most were given in central Nebraska, and most of them three or four or five counties from the river. These were given primarily to help the home orchardists. We are doing It again this winter and are trying to help those not served yet. So we are doing everything that we can to help this state of affairs that exists — that a man with a few trees is apt to neglect them. There are a lot of them doing that now. It would surprise you the number that are pruning and spraying their home orchard where they have per - haps less than an acre. We are meeting with the best results where there are county agents because we can take it up with the county agent, and he can, through the entire year, go around and lend fur - ther assistance after the specialist has been there, and give a series of demonstrations. He can then go there and order spray material and aid the growers in his county where our specialist would not be able to get to all these counties throughout the growing season. I believe I could show you figures that would indicate that through Mr. Hop- </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY pert's efforts last year in these demonstrations he has induced no less than two or three hundred men with home orchards to start pruning and spraying their orchards. Now that is a good start, men, for the first year. I think that is an excellent start for the first year. We intend to keep up that campaign. We will keep him busy during the winter months continuing the campaign. , Mr. Evans, of Kenesaw: May I make another suggestion, or in - quiry rather? Now this Society publishes its annual report, and the University people publish bulletins with reference to this work. Would it be possible to add to that means of publicity a newspaper pub - licity that would reach the farmer promptly on the season when this work would be most effective, and would come home to him in the local papers, and would perhaps be of more benefit and reach more people than the other work? Now there are a great many people who get a bulletin, and it is quite a ponderous thing, and they lay it aside anJ it gets dust-covered. If you have a short article touching upon the vital points necessary for the success of the home orchard, for instance, would not it reach farther and be of more benefit? President Howard: That is a good question, Mr. Evans. We have recognized for several years that to publish bulletins with a lot of figures is a very ineffective means of effective work, and through the Agriculture Extension service now of the College, they have initi - ated a new phase of work known as the Extension News Service that attempts to do just the thing you mention, Mr. Evans, in this way: It has a man who is trained in agricultural journalism who devotes all of his time to assembling timely information and that in turn is sent each day to every newspaper in the state. Of course those edi - tors will get it and then they will publish that portion of it that they think will be of interest to their readers in their particular part of the state; and here is where we come in. We have recently sent out articles through that news service asking the editors to pub - lish that it is time to begin pruning the trees. About two weeks be - fore it is time to spray we send out warning and just as concrete recommendations as we can give as to how mix and apply it, fully ten days before each application should be put on. Now that work is well justified. There is a tremendous amount of information pub - lished that way by all the newspapers in the different parts of the state, and they publish other timely horticultural suggestions through that news service. That is what is being done along that line now. Mr. George Marshall: I believe the main reason that we can't get the average farmer who only has a few trees induced to spray his is that he doesn't realize the difference it will make. He thinks the other fellow can do that, but he can't do it. Now I know they have come to our orchard here by the dozens, and hundreds you might say, to buy apples in the Fall. They have got trees growing on their own place that are just as good as ours and they have enough so that if </seg>

            <seg id="p049">DISCUSSION 49 they would take care of them they could sell to a dbzen of our neigh - bors instead of having their own to buy. But if you try to talk to them about it, they say, "Well I can't do that way, my trees don't seem to do like yours." The fact of the matter is you can't get them to realize it. They seem to be able to realize it. They don't care about selling those apples when they get them. They say they are not peddlers — they are farmers. One Englishman, a neighbor of mine, took a notion that he would spray. He had enough orchard to bear three or four hundred bushels of apples. He had Jonathans, Ben Davis, Grimes Golden, and a lot of summer and fall apples. He came down and asked me to help him, so I told him to get a little barrel spray. He bought a good one that he wanted around the place anyhow for the hog house and chicken coop and potato patch, and he took considerable pains that year, a year ago, to spray his apples. He grew as good apples as we did, and had a dandy nice lot of them. I asked him what he did with them. He said that they had all they wanted to use and he said the hogs like them lots better than they did when the worms were in. I told him we ought to murder him. Well he said he would spray again this year, and he did, but he never sold an apple this year either. You see he was not up to the value of the apple. Anyhow if you could show the man that he could by taking proper care of his orchard produce a Jonathan, that ordinarily he can't hardly get into his cellar because it won't keep long enough not till Christ - mas and you hate yourself and you hate your orchard every time you look at it because it is so poor, that he could produce a Jonathan on the same tree that will be in his cellar today sound and fine and will make him proud, I believe that the farmers would wake up. But how are we going to do this? I was at Atlantic, Iowa, before we knew how to spray, when the old Mr. Wilson, a fruit grower over there, had taken some apples around at Christmas time, some Jon - athans, and they actually called him a wizard because he could keep Jonathans till Christmas that were sound and not all shrivelled up and rotted. Now if we have sprayed the orchards we have Jonathans now. I have anyhow, in my cellar apples that are absolutely sound und there hasn't been five apples to the barrel go to waste. That comes solely from spraying those apples and growing them like they ought to be grown, growing them just half as good as the farmer grows his pigs, and we have to pound this into the average orchardist's head — the value of those trees and what nice fruit he can grow there if he will just have a combination sprayer — you can get a power of a hundred pounds an hours and get power enough to spray the other things around the farm that need spraying. You ought to hare It anyhow, and you can use that same sprayer to take care of all of the things that need spraying, in such a way that it Is as valuable a piece of property as the farm possesses. President Howard: I see Mr. Banning is here. Recently Mr. Ban - ning has been convinced that it would be worth while to take care of </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY an old orchard that his parents planted. He has demonstrated that commercial orcharding in eastern Nebraska is worth while. I would like for him to tell us why he planted a commercial orchard last spring. Mr. Banning: Regarding this old orchard that I took charge of that is on my father's place, and he like a great many other farmers paid very little attention to his orchard In fact I think there are seven acres and somewhere around two hundred trees. Up to about five years ago he got an average of about fifty to one hundred bushels of apples, most of them wormy. He probably got enough for his own use. Later I got enthusiastic about the apple business, and I want to give Mr. Keyser credit for waking those fellows up and get - ting them interested in commercial orcharding down there. I notice that he took some old orchards and made them produce nice fruit. This orchard that we have there we have been spraying for the last three years, and it has been gradually increasing in yield. This year we got about fifteen hundred bushels off of that orchard. It is not a regular stand. There are lots of trees missing, and some of them where there were diseases we cut out. We took care of it, and it is making a nice return for the trouble. That is one thing that has induced me to take up this orcharding. I set out forty acres last year in young orchard, and they are doing nicely, and it hasn't inter - fered a great deal with our farm work on that land. We got a nice leturn from the crops off of that land, and in setting out this orchard — I might go a little bit into the expense of handling during the summer. We put this orchard out under the direction of the Horti - culture Department. Mr. Howard came down several times and gave me what information I asked for, and was a great deal of assistance to me. Now I find that in talking to some other parties there they think it is a big proposition. One fellow says, "Oh, well, Banning can do that because he has a little political pull, and can get these fellows down from Lincoln to help him." I informed him that he could get. just as much information and help as I could. I find that going around to these old orchards farmers have a few trees, and I have talked with them and asked them why they don't spray and take care of them; and they said, "We can go to an orchard and buy the apples — it doesn't pay us anyway. We'd rather cut them down and raise corn. It is all right for a man that wants to follow it as a business to do that, but we haven't time to bother with them." Now I could possibly talk a year at a time but they won't take care of those orchards, so I have come to the conclusion that we ought to have a law to compel them either to cut them down or clean them up. Right across from our orchard there is a strip of possibly six or seven or eight acres — no care taken of it at all, and it is just a harbor for insects and diseases. I think they ought to be compelled to cut them down and clean them up. </seg>
            <seg id="p051">DISCUSSION 51 1 set .)iit these trees on these forty acres thirty-three feet one way and forty the other. Some say I got them a little wide, and some say I ought to put a filler it, but I believe I will just follow along and not put in any fillers. I' have tried to keep that orchard down to just eight varieties, and we set them in blocks. I believe it is better to hold down to certain varieties that experience has taught us are successful than it is to experiment with too many varieties, and I think that this spring I will probably set out a few more. Our orchard did nicely. I lost twenty-seven trees out of one hundred. Out of that twenty-seven I really lost twenty-two. In one low place where it sloped off a little the rabbits worked on two trees and girdled them, and we just took them out; and in one place we had two trees that were washed out; and a neighbor cut one off with the binder. So I really losi only twenty-two, which I thought was doing pretty well for a green hand. Mr. Val Keyser: I think that point Mr. Banning suggests is a good one; that these old orchards should be taken care of or cut down. I believe some legislation — or some rule, now-a-days it is not bo neces - sary for legislation when the State Council of Defense can go out and do whatever it pleases. If no one cares to assume that authority then they ought to pass some legislation. In times like this when the country is railing on us to produce everything that we can produce to feed our own army, our own country, and the allies, it seems to me that it is a crime to allow an acre to stand idle. You take around Nebraska City — I am tamiliar with that perhaps not more than with other sections, but there there are orchards that produce nothing but a little cider stuff that could just as well either feed the people with apples or be taken out and grown with corn, wheat, alfalfa or some other necessity. I think that after a reasonable length of time, or after some legislation has been passed if they do not clean up these orchards, something desperate ought to be done. I do not believe we are going too far. Take off those scare-crows or else take care of them. I used to object to forcing people to do things. I remember in Farmers' Institute work listening to Ex-Governor Porter and some of those men talk dairying and breeding to the people, trying to get them to raise their standards so that our butter could go on the New York market, and not be dis - criminated against three or four cents a pound. A few cleaned up, but of course it had no effect on the way our butter went in the New York market. But a constructive law, not a destructive law, which said, "You have got to clean up, or you can't put that stuff on the market," was passed, and in a year's time Nebraska butter equalled Minnesota butter, and all those other high grade butters in the New York market. Now why can't we do something in fruit growing along that line? I don't think those orchards ought to occupy that land when the government is calling on every citizen to produce everything he can produce to help feed the people. I believe Mr. Banning's sug - gestion is worth considering seriously. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 52 Mr. George Marshall: I don't believe that we can make a law to cut that tree down. Let's make a law to compel them to produce something from that tree, because the government is calling for fruit as well as it is calling for anything else. The boys in the trenches are more tickled when they have the canned apple produced to them, which they get in mighty small quantities and far between — they are more tickled over that than over any other food they get. And it doesn't seem the thing to cut that tree down when we know it can be made to produce. Of course there are some varieties that they might take out. I think they ought to use the tree that is there if it is a valuable variety, and force them not to cut it out but to take care of it, and if it is not taken care of by them, the authorities should take care of it and charge it up to them. In Ohio they had passed a law that they should cut those trees down or clean them up. They did not clean them up then. That has been twenty-five years ago, or more than that, and for several years this remained a helpless, worthless law, but then they amended that law, and I remember coming back there on a visit and the authorities were just cutting the trees down that the owners had neglected to cut, and they actually did cut them all out, and I find that they have planted our southern varieties of cherries there and are doing fine. Well, that law was all right. Now they passed a law there later to cut down the trees for the San Jose Scale, and when it came to cutting down their nice trees, their pear trees and their apple trees, and shade trees in the cities, why of course they would not let them do that, so they got desperate. Everybody was blue — thought it couldn't be done. I watched it for three or four years, and now our old home is as pretty a sight as it ever was, and they have cleaned it all up. Trees there that you couldn't tell one variety from -he other — they were just on their last legs. Well they have cleaned those trees up where they were young enough, and gotten a good growth on them and now for three or four years they have good stands. One person would take the job of taking care of a whole street, and they would pay them so much. When they got at that once, it worked out all right. Mr. L. O. Williams, of University Place: This much is true which I think he ought to take thought of. Our government is stressing in every way the production of larger quantities of pork and corn and wheat — corn and pork particularly are impressed on the farmers as the essential thing; corn for the home production and pork for the boys abroad, and as the hint has been given here — Mr. Marshall gave It — this man whom he quoted sometime ago who preferred to let his orcharding go and let his orchard be unsprayed because the hogs liked the wormy apples the better. The fact is the farmers think more of their hogs today than any other feature of farming. If they can use the wormy apples they probably think it isn't worth while to spray. The farmer has to have some special encouragement, and </seg>
            <seg id="p053">DISCUSSION 53 has to realize that that is some special feature of his farm work. They want to stress the pork and corn production. The orchard is a pretty good place to turn in their hogs. We have got to let them have their way in that matter until the present price of pork takes a serious drop. They are going to stress that feature of farm life. I think it is not worth while attempting to change that at this time of the game — to force farmers to spray their orchards. The war con - ditions will not warrant it. Everywhere they are demanding more grease, more pork, and our boys can get along without apples if they only have pork and corn and wheat, which are the essential mainstays of the soldiers. Mr. Jenkins: I wish to take issue with Mr. Williams in regard to allowing the hogs to eat the apples because our boys in the trenches need pork worse. I believe that if all the trees produced a crop we will get millions and millions of bushels of apples that we do not get now, and they will all be sound. These apples will be consumed by we people who stay at home, and the pork and corn and wheat can go to feed our boys, and probably we can find a little room to put in a few boxes of apples and canned apples. I believe that the movement that Mr. Hoover has set on foot to conserve the food has been won - derful, but I think one thing has been sadly neglected, and that is the conservation of the fruit crops. We have had no attention hardly at all. Great attention has been given to conserving the wheat, to conserving meat and pork, but nothing has been said, comparatively. about the conserving of these millions of bushels of fruit which may be conserved and may be used by us as substitutes for the heavier foods, and I believe that if we take the proper action, and that if we do what we may do at this meeting, a movement may be set on foot which will go a long way in calling the people's attention to what they may do by using the home fruits, by canning them and drying them, etc., and in this way being a great factor in helping to win the Mr. Val Keyser: I would say that a movement is on and nearly money enough raised to send one hundred thousand bushels of apples to the boys in the trenches. There is a great deal of work done on that in the East. You can get information on that by writing Mr. Phillips. Chicago and New York contributed the most of the money, and they are going to send part of a cargo over of this last year's growing. President Howard: You can get that information without going that far for it. I am really tempted to say that Mr. Jenkins has not been reading the paper of this Society, because it is even pub - lished in our own magazine. I thing he is correct in saying that there should be some action taken perhaps to show our willingness to devote our time to encouraging the utilization of our orchard products and garden products particularly. I am rather of the opinion </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY that the more effective means would be to emphasize vegetable garden - ing and its possibilities during the war in so far as substituting things for the table were concerned to laying all the emphasis on the fruits. Mr. L. O. Williams: I want to give an explanation of my attitude. Iam not opposing the production of apples, but I do say that it is &gt;t worth our while to try to induce the farmers to raise them on a small scale. It is the commercial orchards that must raise them. Mr. Banning: I don't want to be understood as meaning that thesf orchards should all be cut down, but I do think they should be com - pelled to clean them up. I don't think that the fellow who allows them to stand around to breed moths and disease has any more right to do that than a farmer has to allow a diseased cow to get over into the neighboring herds. I think these old orchards should be cleaned up and taken care of and in that way prevent disease from spreading to other orchards that are close to them. You know there are orchards in our country that we sprayed outside of our own, but we can't fol - low them up because we haven't time. There was one small orchard that had never produced anything — he never got enough for his own use — and we sprayed it for him this year. He had just a small orchard, and he got plenty of apples and sold some apples to us, around two hundred dollars' worth, and we shipped them out for him. Besides we find that he sold some to his neighbors. Now we have rather converted that fellow. There were other orchardists who asked us to spray their orchards, but we told them their orchards were not worth it. There were a lot of trees that should have been taken out that were diseased. The farmers will just let them stand there as a menace to the rest. Mr. Jenkins: I don't wish to be understood as criticizing the Society for the good work that they have done, but the point occurs to me that our society paper doesn't reach many of the people «who need it worst. The government has put on a great food propaganda in food conservation, and if we could just have a few lines regarding the subject we are talking about today it would help to accomplish the results intended. President Howard. It is a very perplexing problem as to what should be done with the neglected home orchard. I am convinced in my own mind that we should not have a law that would state that all orchards must be pruned and sprayed and properly cared for, because I am firmly convinced that many of them should be cut off at the ground. Now in order to make a law that would say that these orchards must be cared for and the others cut down would involve some difficulty. It might be that many home orchard owners have orchards that they can be made to see would be of profit if they would take care of them, as some of them are seeing. We might do a great deal of injustice by causing some to cut out trees that might </seg>

This year the man sold one hundred twenty-four dollars worth of apples besides those for his own use, from three-quarters of an acre of orchard. It has aroused that man to the importance of caring for that orchard. 1 nave not the slightest doubt but that man's influence will be felt in that neighborhood. I have little doubt but what he will cause a good deal more of careful orcharding in that neighborhood. I have a great deal of confidence in giving demonstrations in the home orchard sections, in that it will cause a large number to be cared for, and I question the wisdom of passing a drastic law so far as compelling men to cut out their orchards or compelling them to prune them or spray them. There would he difficulty. I think legis - lation could be had in case of extremely dangerous diseases or insects. I have not the slightest doubt about this legislation. In fact, we have It. Mr. Banning: What are you going to do with a man who won't clean up, even when he acknowledges he is guilty? President Howard: What are you going to do with a man that has a dirty backyard, and you know his stock is suffering. What are you going to do with that man? Mr. Banning: I thing he should be compelled to clean up a little. President Howard: But it is a question as to how it should be done. There are a lot of things besides horticulture, and all men are not perfect. Now the time has just about arrived when we should adjourn this meeting. It is the usual custom to appoint an auditing committee. What is the pleasure of the Society regarding this?

            <seg id="p058">58 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Tuesday Afternoon, January 15, 1918. Meeting called to order by Chairman. L Chairman: Our first speaker this afternoon is Mr. Geo. A. Mar- H, who will speak to us on the subject of, "Summing up of the Progress of Horticulture in Nebraska." SUMMING UP THK PKOGItKKK OV HORTICVXTUBE IN NEBRASKA." Geo. A. Marshall Looking back over the development of this country, we remem - ber that less than fifty years ago, the prairies had only wild fruits and trees where sheltered from fire, confining them to the skirts of the streams, canyons, etc., and largely in the eastern part of the state. As we would leave the Missouri River this woody growth gradually diminished and central Nebraska contained large tracts that were nearly devoid of trees. Many of our very best homes of today were located on these beautiful prairie hills and that time, were without even a gooseberry bush in sight. When we compare the above described home surroundings with that of the present home, with its beautiful lawns, large trees, roses, shrubs and plants about the dooryard, one can hardly realize that such a change was possible. The homes here, on the Nebraska prairies, are as attractive as you will find anywhere in the country. Also there are large groves now, which serves the purpose of shelter-belts and wood-lots and furnish fuel, posts, poles and timber. The thought of this change brings the progress of Horticulture vividly to our minds. True, there are many difficulties that arise from time to time, as is the case in the growing of grains, vegetables, live stock and poul - try. Some of these, upon their first appearance, seemed almost uncon - trollable. Coddling moths, apple scab and the various insects and fungus enemies were some of the first things that we had to com - bat. Then when the San Jose scale made its appearance and we first learned of its tenacity and destructiveness, it looked like the pear and possibly the apple was doomed. The scare, however, has all passed, and it has been found that it was easier to control than the coddling moth, and several others of the older plagues. We are now Just recovering from the first shock of the Illinois blister canker, no doubt it will also soon be controlled by the orchardists and classed with the common enemies, which only call for close attention and better care. Further summing up the progress of Horticulture, we note iso - lated instances of commercial planting in nearly every part of the </seg>
            <seg id="p059">SUMMING UP THE PROGRESS OF HORTICULTURE 59 state and some very successful. We further note that the growing of fruits commercially has developed considerably in certain localities, especially in the eastern and older parts of the state. The strawberry, raspberry, blackberry and the grape have become quite a commercial product in many localities. The "Loess" hills of eastern Nebraska have been quite naturally adapted to the commercial apple growing. While there has aever been any real tree planting boom in this section of the country, yet hundreds of cars of apples are shipped annually from single shipping points through this section of the state. When well grown and graded under modern methods, this fruit finds ready markets at liberal prices in almost all sections of the country. While the care and manage - ment of these commercial orchards has been wonderfully improved in the past ten years, yet much more progress can be made along this line and a much higher state of perfection can be obtained. The soil and climate here is such 83 to give the proper finishing touches to the apple and give us the happy combination of size, color and quality. Among the better varieties, the section from Burt County to the southern line of the state and especially southeastern Nebraska seems to be the home of the Jonathan, Grimes, Winesap and other leading commercial varieties which develop here to perfection. We have also noted that the trees thrive especially well and are very productive, bearing quite heavy annually. Also that there is no place where an orchard can be planted and grown into bearing cheaper than here. An orchard can be planted and well cared for, and the product of intercropping on the land will pay all this expense and in addition will return to the owner a satisfactory income from the start and will continue this, with the exception of a year or so just before the trees come into bearing. The world is demanding more apples. A great many sections that were supposed to be profitable for fruit growing have proven otherwise for various reasons, largely however on account of the expense of growing the trees and fruit, and from the isolation from the market. In these places, commercial planting has largely ceased. Observation has shown that there is no place in the United States where a bushel of good apples can be grown and marketed cheaper than here, and very few places where it can be done as cheaply. We have less than our share of killing frost and more than our share of profitable crops. In many of the apple sections of the country, com - mercial growers count on one full crop, one 50% crop and then one very light crop or failure in every three years. At our place Just north of Omaha, in Washington County, we have had four full crops, one 60% crop, one 40% crop, and one 35% crop in the last seven years. I have not heard of a seven years' average outside of the Mis - souri River Hill district that will come up to this. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">6 0 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY In summing it all up, I am fully convinced that our advantages are great and that our future success simply depends on our efforts. I never asked the Shuberts whether they had averaged this up there from year to year, but Mr. Keyser has probably paid pretty close attention there, as he is in that hill country. Discussion Mr. Val Keyser: Mr. Marshall, referring to some of our own work there in the last six years. We have grown six consecutive crops in the last six years. Take for instance our Winesap orchard. We had one light crop after a heavy pruning. That was the 1914 crop. 1915, 1916, and 1917 were heavy crops. There was apparently not much variation in that one orchard. We didn't expect it though. The theory always handed down, you know, was that you always get a light and a heavy. Beaver Brothers' orchard, in Falls City, bears a rather light crop, and has had a crop every year for the last seven years. I don't think that there is any other fruit section in the country that can boast of those things. We have a fret-ze-out once in a while. I can remember them, but there has never been a time I think since I have been observing and studying horticulture in the last fifteen years, but what some section of eastern Nebraska produced a fruit crop. When they did not have it in Arlington, they did have it in Neniaha or Rich - ardson, etc. But you always can get a fruit crop in eastern Nebraska. The future possibilities and outlook for this section are good to esti - mate. President: I think in discussing this matter of what we may ex - pect from commercial orchards, we are considering a very important question. I am led to believe that the matter of causing an orchard to bear annually is largely a matter of good treatment to that orchad. That is, I think we will learn in the future that the cumulative effect of good treatment is a very important matter. It is a matter that we do not have very much accurate data on at present. I can sanction the statement made by Mr. Keyser that there are orchards in this state that have borne crops, profitable crops, for the past seven years, consecutively. In discussing that matter I believe that one would be forced to take the matter of good treatment into account, when he is discussing the matter of causing an orchard to be profitable over a long period of years, and a number of years that there are off years, and so on. I think it would depend largely upon the treatment. We will have that point, no doubt, brought out in the papers that are to follow. Mr. Marshall touched upon a very important matter when he mentioned the point fnat orchards should be made to grow, and yet the owner should not be made to pay a high rate of interest on a big investment. I presume that our next paper will discuss the importance of that point. </seg>
            <seg id="p061">MAKING A YOUNG ORCHARD SELF-SUPPORTING 61 Paper by Mr. A. M. Shubert, of Shubert, Nebraska, follows, on Making a Young Orchard Self Supporting." "MAKING A YOUNG ORCHARD SKLF-HIPPORTING" A. M. Shubert I have not any paper prepared, but I will give you my idea of my work, as Mr. Youngers and Mr. Marshall have told you all about growing the apples, and, in fact, all of it but the real work. The growing of orchards in eastern Nebraska is usually on our rolling land or our thin land, and as a usual thing it is not best for yielding our agricultural crops. It is generally put into corn, or neces - sarily it should be put into corn on the start, as it is not practical to put it into red clover till the orchard is well started on account of the pocket gopher cutting off a number of the trees. I put in forty acres of orchard, following with clover and thought the cultiva - tion would cause them to move immediately, but I lost a number of trees that year. Of late years, however, we are getting splendid returns. The price for the grain is good, and with very little loss we can grow probably four-fifths as much grain between the tree rows as in a similar ground where there isn't any orchard. But in my first experience in the early nineties, I commenced growing about one hundred acres of orchard, and the trees were so small, and it was absolutely necessary for me to pay my interest on the investment, that I found it pretty hard at that time. But I could give you some figures showing that we are holding together, and that we get a return that would pay a good rent on all our holdings and caring for the orchards and it is handled by tenants. President Howard: I think Mr. Shubert has had as much experi - ence perhaps as any man in the state in making young orchards self - supporting. I think we might bring out some discussion. Aren't there some questions relating to this that Mr. Shubert did not touch on? Mr. Williams: When you spoke of raising grain between the tree rows, Mr. Shubert, did you refer to the bearing time, or the period prior to the year of bearing? Mr. Shubert: Red clover should be put in probably four or five years after the orchard is started, according to the condition of the soil. If the corn has been raised on that soil prior to putting out the orchard, then it really is not very profitable for corn land. It should not be put into clover for four or five years. The hay crop is a profitable crop, and I have taken good hay from orchards after it commenced bearing, but I would not think one should take very much hay as clover is a very cheap mulch, as a moisture retainer. It retains the moisture as it falls on the rolling land and there is no erosion from the washes. I have even had timothy that is really more profitable </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY (or hay in the orchards, but I thing that the bluegrass follows the timothy much quicker than it does the red clover. I have also tried alfalfa, and I thing it could be grown, but I think it requires more moisture to use alfalfa — much more — than it does the red clover. Mr. Val Keyser. Do you think that the land in a young orchard would make four per cent on evaluation? Mr. Shubert: Yes. We have an eighty that I think I could give the exact figures on, that we got in the last two or three years four per cent or more. Last year I remember we got $903.50, and the corn sold at 90 cents a bushel; or it was just a little over one thou - sand bushels of corn that we got from the eighty acres. There is a little waste land, and there are four or five acres in the barnyard and house, and a slough, so that it can't possibly be more than sixty acres in corn, and it has produced again this year I know more than one thousand bushels of corn. Mr. Keyser: You mean your rent is one thousand bushels? Mr. Shubert: Yes. This year it would be more than one thou - sand bushels of corn and that would mean $1,500.00 rent, and last year it was $903.50. I can verify that statement, I am sure, and the year before that it was one thousand bushels or a little more, and that has been out three years, and I think we may grow corn there several more years as that is pretty good land. Some of the other land is more rolling and not quite as productive, but we have prob - ably about four-fifths as much corn as we would grow without the orchard. Then the clover following that time and the hay crop, and the seed crop taken care of. It is a profitable crop to grow, as well as a fertilizer for the bearing orchard. Mr. Williams: How many years do you figure on before the orchards come into bearing? A. About ten years. Mr. Azendorf: Can you follow by other crops until they get to bearing? A. Until they are past twenty try to take the seed crops all from years of age; that is, it we don't it. In the former years it is not necessary to leave the seed crop. It is very easy to keep the orchard clean from weeds and guard against fire by having the red clover in the most of the year that fire would spread. Chairman: Regarding Mr. Shubert's recommendation that the orchard be cultivated to corn the first four or five years and then put to clover, suggests this question: There are many farms in eastern Nebraska that have been farmed for so long to the grain crops that they are becoming somewhat depleted of their elements of fertility on the surface, and it is on those farms that you are apt to find some man coming to the conclusion that they should put that land to orchard </seg>

            <seg id="p064"/>
            <seg id="p065">MAKING YOUNG ORCHARD SELF-SUPPORTING 65 perhaps. In other words, we are apt to find a lot of our commercial orchards being planted upon land that has been made somewhat unpro - ductive by a continuous cropping system without the help of a legume. Now I happen to know that that condition of affairs exists. Now In that particular case, would it be more advisable to run the risk of injury from gophers by putting that orchard to clover immediately and keeping the trees free from weeds by hoeing, in order that the clover will not sap the moisture from the ground; or would it be better to attempt to continue to cultivate that already depleted soil before you put it to clover? That is a practical question we had to face on some land that had been cropped continuously to corn for nineteen years. A. If it was past the productive stage of growing corn, I would probably grow clover, but even oats or wheat can be grown in the orchard. You should grow oats to start the clover. The hillside* of course are preferable. The air drainage is best in the low land, and course that is more productive for any other agricultural crops, such as corn and wheat and hay, but I think it should be cultivated the first two or three years if possible, or kept plowed, as the gophers will invariably come into our country if they have not been kept after, and of course they are not apt to be looked after close enough to keep them from cutting a good many of the tree roots while they are young. Mr. Brown: I would like to ask Mr. Shubert if he ever tried to get rid of his gophers. A. We have a pretty good supply now. Mr. Brown: Although of course we don't have the gophers in our country that they do down there, they are getting to be quite a pest in the alfalfa fields, and the farmer who takes a little bit of trouble each year keeps his gophers under control. Chairman: I believe Mr. Brown's suggestion is a good one; we found in our orchard that the gophers were becoming quite numerous. We offered a reward on them. We gave the boys in the neighborhood ten cents a scalp for them, and they caught forty-seven gophers, or at least were paid for forty-seven scalps. I hope they caught them on our place, and really it had a wonderful effect on thinning them out. You very seldom find a new mound. They caught them by trapping. They took ordinary little steel traps — little ten-cent traps, and set them. .1 understand that they can be poisoned very effectively also. Mr. Brown. That is a point well worth speaking about. I have had no difficulty at all. I can take an ordinary bottle of strychnine and a small handful of raisins, and I can catch a whole fieldful and it only takes a few hours to do it. Mr. Shubert: How did you do that? Mr. Brown: I used to take a wagon and put a small portion of strychnine in each one of the raisins, and then drive to the field. </seg>
            <seg id="p066">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 66 You can go to the fresh mound any time and find, by prodding around, just where they are. Then open that up and drop a raisin in, and you have Mr. Gopher every time. Question: Have your neighbors any gophers? Mr. Brown: Yes, they are getting so that they are quite a pest in alfalfa fields. Question: Do your neighbors have trouble with their stock? That is, with poison being spread by the gophers to stock? Mr. Brown. The same as weed seeds blow over the fence, but that is no reason for you to neglect the weeds. Question: That is the trouble I have found. Mr. Brown: But if you get any good thing in this life, you have to keep after it. Mr. Shubert: I think Mr. Brown would find it necessary to buy a new car or two in order to inspect four or five hundred acres of land. We do that on a small scale, but for four or five hundred acres of young trees you find it is a big job. If you have it all seeded down, it would be practically impossible. Mr. Brown: That is probably true too, but it is like everything else. You have to keep right after a thing. Chairman: I would like to answer Mr. Shubert's protest. In Gage County two years ago there was an organized effort to eradicate gophers from a large area there. They planned a gopher campaign, and I am told that on a certain week the farmers owning land went over every bit of land in several sections. They all did that in the same week, I think after Mr. Brown's prescription. So it really can be done on a large scale, if you get all the farmers at it; but it takes someone to organize it and push it, and see that it is done. Mr. Weber. I would like to know how many there are here who have in their county passed an ordinance or law by which the ten cents a head is given for gophers. How many have done that? You know at the last legislature they passed a law allowing ten cents a head for premium on each gopher that was killed, and a number of the counties took advantage of this. Boys and girls thought that applied without anything else being done by the county, and you know a number have brought forty or fifty or a hundred to our court house, and the County Commissioner said, "Well, we have to say whether we will allow it." There should have been a provision in the law that the County Com - missioners would have to say they would allow it. But it was left with a few men to say whether they wanted the gophers killed bad enough to pay ten cents a head. I wrote a little article to the Journal, and the Commissioners got quite wrathy about it, and I said that those boys and girls who brought those gophers in expected the ten cents. One of the boys said, "We are going to take a sack of flour home with </seg>
            <seg id="p067">MAKING YOUNG ORCHARD SELF-SUPPORTING 67 the money we get for these," and one of them had $4.10 worth, and the Commissioners said, "Well it is worth that much to your farm, to yourselves, to do it;" but this boy said, "But we are getting them off our farm and the next fellow has them and they will be right on our place tomorrow, so we have to do all the killing." I wondered what you men have thought about that. Mr. Smith: Speaking of the eradication of the gopher. My method has been a little different from Mr. Shubert's or Mr. Brown's. I put out an orchard, and it was soon infested with gophers. The first year they destroyed three hundred and fifty trees, and I offered ten cents apiece for catching them, and the man that I employed caught forty - three, and then said he could not get any more; it was too much work. So- I undertook to catch them, and there is a large amount of work about it, gentlemen. A man who has anything else to do can't afford to trap gophers. You dig around to find the hole, and to set the trap, etc. — and it is no fun — the trapping of gophers. So I hit on a plan — I don't know where I got the suggestion. I won't claim the originality of it. I used sweet potatoes. I cut them up in little cubes about one - half inch square, and got some strychnine. Take the little sweet pota - toes and put in some strychnine. I will get quite a lot of them — a hatful at a time when the gophers are fairly thick. When you first start in it would take a fairly good man to go over twenty acres. Now it is not necessary, from my experience, to put a poisoned bait in every mound by any means; but you will go into the orchard and there will be a little colony where there are quite a number of mounds together. If you take a little spade to find the hole, after you work at it a little bit you can strike the hole almost every time. There is a sound about ihe earth that will indicate to the experienced digger where the runway is, and as quick as I strike it I take a little stick about two feet long, sharpened at one end, and put the sweet potato in, and on the other side I use a patent arrangement called "Gopher-go." You put a Httle of that in the other side, and no matter which way they come from they will either get the poisoned raisin or sweet potato. I entirely eradicated the gophers from my place this way. Last year, owing to the alfalfa being killed out almost unanimously In my neighbor's fields, I had a large number of the gophers come into those old runways, to I gave them another bait and have no doubt but that I will be suc - cessful because I have tried it now for ten years and by being per - sistent to start with I can get rid of the gophers — every one of them. I wanted to speak of this red clover. I take issue with Mr. Shu - bert on one point. I have found the red clover very successful after about the fourth year, but I don't take any clover from the field. I leave it as a mulch. I don't think it is fair to put orchard on old ground, and then take off the crop. One place in my orchard was so steep that I never cultivated it except the first year. I put out the trees and then I cultivated around them with a hoe In order to make </seg>

In refer - ence to putting red clover in when you first set out the orchard on account of the ground being bare. The only objection is from the tree hops. When the trees are small the buffalo tree hops would live on this clover, and they cut the bark on the trees and injure them badly. That is the only reason I with. would not put red clover in to start President Howard: If there ahead with the program. are no other questions, we will go Mr. Val Keyser, Nebraska City, Rives a talk on "Clean Culture for the Bearing Orchard, Does It Pay"" (I.KAN ( I I Tl ItK KOK THK Itl \i;i\(.

If so, why so? If you do I cultivate, why not? Cultivation is one of the essentials to the production of a crop of good apples, that is, under ordinary conditions in the avarafc ag orchard. Like spraying and pruning, to cultivate an orchard properly requires some experience and judgment. These tacts we have discov - ered after six consecutive years in the practice of cultivating bearing orchards. Practically every orchard in Nebraska would benefit by a little cultivation, on the other hand many orchards in the state have been ruined by too much careless cultivation. The following are some of the things accomplished by proper cultivation : First — Conserves moisture Second — Allows for proper airing of the soil Third- — Incorporates vegetable matter such as the fallen leaves weeds and grass with the surface soil. Fourth — Hastens decay of the vegetable matter and makes avail - able more plant food for the use of the trees.

Ninth- Usually lengthens the time of maturing the fruit Tenth — Makes it muddy and nasty at apple picking time, should the season be wet. Some of the things above outlined were learned at college, others in the school of experience. The writer is satisfied, judging from personal experience that all of the things outlined above have been accomplished in the orchards which he has personally operated during the past five and six years. When an old orchard is taken for a thorough renovation in which a heavy pruning is necessary, by all means cultivate thoroughly the first season to encourage growth of the trees but please remember that in eastern Nebraska continued annual cultivation of a bearing orchard will greatly lengthen the season of ripening and coloring the fruit. Orchards which have behaved in this manner are being seeded down to red clover. The time to commence cultivation is early in the spring as soon as the frost is out of the ground. Provided the soil is sufficiently dry to permit the use of an orchard disk. We have cultivated orchards with the disk where it was necessary to break up a mat of heavy blue grass sod. By double disking and cross disking early and then repeat - ing the operation during the spraying season and finishing the job after the spraying is done, we have succeeded in putting the soil into a tilth like that of a garden. We never cultivate after the middle of July as we have found it desirable to allow the weeds and grass to grow so that the orchard can be moved out thoroughly and the trash will nicely cover the cul - tivated soil. It is so much more pleasant work during picking sea - son in an orchard cultivated as above described. As an argument substantiating our method for handling the bear - ing orchard, we produce the fruit. We have not failed to grow a crop of apples for six consecutive seasons beginning 1911. The writer is familiar with some orchards which have been culti - vated; also orchards which were not cultivated, where the results have not been so flattering. Each year we have had some orchards cultivated and some which were in sod so that it has afforded a good opportunity to observe the advantages and disadvantages of cultivating an orchard. As most of my fellow growers have visited our orchards, there is little now which the writer could tell and as I understand the Secre - tary, in extending the invitation for me to appear on this program, desired that I lead in a thorough discussion on this subject, I had bet - ter get out of the way and let somebody cultivate who can cultivate. </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Discussion Mr. Keyser: There is one point that I want to make. The Wine - sap orchard that I have been operating this year used to mature early. We have not increased the size of the trees, but we have greatly lengthened the period of ripening until we can hardly get it out of the way of the freeze. The apples mature two weeks earlier. The crop would do to harvest from two to three weeks, of the same varieties, earlier than before. So I think that we ought to, in cultivating an orchard, do it advisedly, and not overdo it. I know of an orchard in Saline County where it was over-cultivated when it was young, and when it was bearing the trees were left on a mound. It was really two or two and one-half feet lower in the center than in the tree row. Such cultivation as that, of course, does not pay. It is not done with Judgment. On rolling ground a bearing orchard can be cultivated, but I think it ought to be seeded to clover, especially strips between the trees. We ought to keep the soil from wearing away; we ought to encourage the reaching into the soil of all of the vegetable matter which is properly incorporated with the soil. Clover does that of itself. It puts nitrogen into the soil, and the rain will carry it down in. Thus the soil is growing richer all the time. Cultivation will let nitrogen escape from the soil. Alfalfa is the richest in nitrogen. You can't make it richer with any kind of chemical fertilizer. Con - tinually cultivate it, and in a few years you deplete it of its nitrogen. That is one reason why, in cultivating our bearing orchards, we dis - continue the tilling of the soil about July 1st. It' you break that soil up properly early in the spring, then you have it in such condition that you can cultivate it later on. One year in Wyoming, it turned dry about the tenth of July. We cultivated once or twice early in the spring and had a pretty good mulch. We went in there and took four horses and held that mulch a little while longer, and then cultivated later on. Early cultivation gets your size in your fruit early in the season and you don't have to worry about it later in the Fall. On the other hand, if you keep that up too long you make those things so late — especially the Winesaps and some of the other varieties — that they won't mature in time to get out of the way of the frost around the 20th of October. I wanted to make this suggestion so that anyone else that cares to may profit by it. If you use judgment in cultivation you can put a good color on the stuff so that you will be proud of it. Mr. Smith. Do you do any disking with the harrow? A. Sometimes we harrow it dow n so that we can run over it with the mower. We find that if we stop cultivating around the first of July, and have a few rains, there is plenty of growth comes up and we have to mow that out. That is one of our regular jobs about State Fair time. We usually pick the summer stuff, and then there is a good deal of foxtail and all sorts of grass in the orchard. But </seg>

            <seg id="p073">DISCUSSION 73 I I ve nil in with the mowing machine and mow out between the tree ows and clear that up before we harvest the later apples. ■ Our method of cultivation has worked out pretty well. I believe soil is getting richer. Mr. Marshall: Do you know of anyone that has used the tractor, nd what success they had? A. Fine. An orchard is the hottest thing on earth when It i« t, in July and August. We find it is necessary to get out early in the morning and work till ten o'clock and have to stop — it is so hot. But with a tractor, you can put an umbrella over you and go ahead. There is no question about the tractor being a fine thing — but It Is necessary to judge whether the proposition is large enough to assure its paying for itself. It is perhaps absolutely necessary for many to cultivate, on account of their trees being planted so close together and the soil being a little different, so that it does not hold the moisture io well. Then it is necessary to cultivate, and to do it pretty sys - ematically. Mr. Smith: How close do you get to the trees in cultivating? A. Go right up to within six inches of them. All of these things together. There are three essentials — pruning, spraying and culti- ating. After we prune the trees, we head them higher, and Mr. Mar - hall and I used to have a good many arguments about that. Pruning hem his way produced the crop, and pruning them my way also iroduced the crop. Use an extension disk, four or five disks on a side. Drive right to the tree if it heads up a little, and cultivate pretty close to tree. Last summer, not having pruned some of the orchards for • years, it was necessary to stay away four or five feet from the trunks of the trees, but we are heading them up again. An orchard disk is something every orchardist ought to have. I think it is a good plan to get in there and stir that soil up. You will get rid of a lot of diseases. On the other hand, if you cultivate in the spring, it is a big job after it turns wet. It is the safest thing to do. You cannot tell days ahead what kind of a season you are going to have. If you are fixed right in the spring you can go on cultivating. If you don't need to you can let it go. It doesn't take a great while if the cultivating is done when the weather is cool, and we think it pays. On some of the orchards we are going to seed them down, be - cause they get later and later every year, and fail to color. Mr. Smith: What is the make of that disk? A. We use the Johnson Harvester disk. The International have one with a shield on, that is probably an improvement. Mr. Smith: The widest I could get was six feet spread. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">74 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY A. You can get them with nearly eight feet spread — in fact I think you could get them as wide as you want. On a hillside cultivate parallel to the orchard. If the slope is toward the west, cultivate north and south, and don't cultivate be - tween the trees. But if you are going to mow out, then harrow it down so that you can run a mowing machine. We have only done these things in cultivation in order to make it more convenient to use the machine we have to use later on. I Mr. Saunders: Can you get as good a growth on a young orchard seeding it to red clover on depleted farm land, as you can if you tivate that land, even if your crop is very profitable? A. I couldn't answer that. I believe you would though bMr. Shubert. I believe that if a person only had a small area and Id cultivate around the trees just a short distance that he would that it would be all right. Mr. Saunders: Just a little experience Professor Howard knows of, in Mr. McClusky's orchard. That piece of land had been in corn for forty years, with the exception of two years, before that orchard was put out. He put out just seventy-five trees and set strawberries in, and of course in caring for the strawberries he kept the best care of his trees. For the age of the trees, I don't know as I ever saw an orchard that has made the growth tiat they have there, and he cul - tivated thoroughly, just as clean as a strawberry bed ought to be kept. Shubert: If we use the cowpeas I think they would be a table crop, and they are splendid lor the orchard possibly as good as clover. Chairman: I had an opportunity to see cowpeas tried one season in a bearing orchard in 1910. These cowpeas were of the New Era variety — about the earliest variety, sown broadcast and then disked in. They did not make sufficient growth last year to make a good crop. No doubt they would bear a good crop if we can get sufficient moisture to get enough growth on them, or to sow them in midsum - mer and get sufficient growth the latter part of the summer. In regard to the advisability of sowing clover in an orchard that las been depleted of the humus and plant food by continuous cropping, might say that I have had an opportunity to see a twenty-five acre rchard that has been planted now two years that lias been given that eatment. It has been planted nineteen years to corn, and the trees ade satisfactory growth with clover there. I think that would an - wer Mr. Saunder's question. The trees have been hoed- -perhaps iree feet in all directions around the trees hoed two or three times uring the growing season. Those trees for two seasons have made an zcellent growth - perhaps not as much growth as Mr. McClusky's. our neighbor, but I think they have made sufficient growth. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">DISCUSSION 75 Now Mr. Keyser has pointed out the important results that we may expect from cultivation of bearing orchards. He has given us his experience in these orchards that he has been dealing with and told us of the effect. It occurred to me that since different pieces of land vary so greatly, depending on how they have been treated in previous years, that one man's experience might not apply to his neighbor's unless his neighbor's had similar conditions. I have reference to the way in which the soil had been treated. I wonder if he could tell us whether or not one could make a general statement in regard to a rule that could be followed? We will say allowing the tree to be an index as to whether or not you should cease cultivation. Say, make a recommendation to a man by mail that would help him, if you didn't know his orchard — hadn't seen it? Do you think your experience would merit you to make a statement? A. (I would just send him this paper that I wrote.) No, that is a difficult thing. We all, in making this kind of a talk, if we don't give somebody's else speech we give our own experience. If we don't do that the talk would not amount to much. Of course I have been up and down the river, and practically every orchard that grows I have seen, and I have tried to learn as much as I could about the different ways of handling the orchards. I think cultivation is an important thing. As somewhat a student of soils, I used to study those things a good deal. Cultivation does a great many things besides hold moisture, and we ought to think about some of those. That is why I outlined them. Letting the air into the soil has a tendency to con - vert materials thai are not ready for plant food. You do about aa much good that way sometimes as you do by conserving moisture. You don't need to conserve moisture in a wet time. You need air in your soil, and then you cultivate to get rid of your moisture by cultiva - tion; the physical condition of the soil is just as Important as the fertility of the soil. If it is not handled in the right way it Isn't going to be of use to you. We ought to get into these orchards and cultivate them up and get rid of that sod, even if they are hillsides and can be cultivated so that they won't wash away. It puts new life into them. Practically all of the apple buyers that have visited our orchards for the last two or three years have said, and I don't know but George Marshall made the remark, "Look at the foliage on those trees." The apple buyers will say, "This orchard looks like it has leaves enough on it to mature the crop. Nothing has done it but cultivation, because we cut off over half the branches that bore leaves when we first went at this orchard. Mr. Shubert: If you found that the excess moisture in the latter part of July and August has retained the coloring and ripening of the different varieties of the fruit, do you attribute that to the late cul - tivation, or even when we have had exceedingly wet years — why is that? </seg>
            <seg id="p076">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 76 A. I have not noticed any difference. We had more trouble in dry years. At Weeping Water, in 1911, when the season was pretty dry, we cultivated thoroughly. We left them hanging on the trees to let the color make up for some of the size, and lost about three thou - sand bushels of good aples because we left them too long. A little moisture in the air helps to color the fruit, it is generally conceded. LMr. Shubert: Wtiat then do you attribute the late ripening of tivated orchards to? A. I had not got that figured out Mr. Brown: I think if these gentlemen will go out to our corn - elds they would find some of the causes of the late ripening of the pples in a dry year. They get to a certain point just as our corn d and didn't have moisture enough to carry it beyond that point, and lien the moisture came it went on developing. The apples in a dry ear don't have moisture enough to carry them on and develop nor - ally. We found that we had better apples ordinarily in a season of lundance of moisture and better coloring. To prove this in regard the corn: Our corn grown on creek bottoms were some of the best elds of corn. Nearly all of the corn was on hard soil. Chairman: Mr. Keyser's observations coincide very closely with hose made with orchards in New York State under observation for wut sixteen years to determine the effects of clean cultivation versus o cultivation. They have published on that experiment several times. and in their latest report they mention that in a cultivated plat the pples will mature from ten days to weeks later than the apples in le sod plat. They also mention that in the cultivated plat the foliage s heavier and stays on longer and is greener than it is in the sod at. Judging from the conclusions that they have come to. I would link that any conditions that woulcj favor luxuriant growth of the eaves' and wood and therefore maximum leaf surface would also be onducive to late maturity, and whether it be excessive pruning or oisture or excessive cultivation or a combination of all of those the esults are desirable. We will now have a paper by Mr. E. H. Hoppert, of Lincoln, on the subject of "Regulating the Bearing Habits of Fruit Trees." "REGVLATIXti THE BKAKINU HA HITS OF THR APPL.K OIMHAKO" K. H. Hoppert t"My orchard does not pay," how often one hears this statement. en such orchard owners are asked, 'Why don't you spray?" they wer, "What's the use?

If one could be assured of a crop every year it might pay." Commercial growers, too, would profit greatly by having a fair crop each year, rather than bumper crop one year and a light one the next. Regularity in bearing means to the com - mercial grower more uniform profits, better fruit, better distribution (it labor, better, trees and a greater average profit. Systematic pruning, spraying, cultivating, and occasionally thinning of the young fruit, are practices considered essential to success, by the foremost orchardists of today. Whenever the orchard is allowed to shift for itself it soon acquires the shiftless habit of bearing fruit every other year. Before discussing the factors influencing regularity of bearing, it might be well to consider the manner in which the apple tree bears its fruit. Most varieties of apples bear almost altogether on short crooked branches called spurs. Occasionally apples are born on one year wood, either from side buds or from end buds, also called lateral buds and terminal buds. In the main, however, the fruit of the apple is produced on spurs. Upon closer observation of these spurs at this time of the year we may find on the end of one of its very short branches a rather large, white, downy bud. Next spring this bud ex - pands and produces perhaps six to eight leaves surrounding from four to six blossoms. Under normal conditions one or possibly two of these blossoms set and the others drop off. The growing and ripening of the apples takes about all of the strength of the spur that year, but it usually manages to develop at one side a small leaf bud, which dur - ing the following year makes a short growth in a new direction, and during the latter part of the growing season, uses its energies in mak - ing another fruit bud. The following year the above described pro - cess repeats itself. We see from this why the spurs only bear every other year. Recent observations made at the Missouri Experiment Station with fruit spurs, show that usually the bearing spurs have a smaller number of leaves and that the leaves are smaller in size than similar non-bearing spurs, the leaf surface of the latter measuring nearly fifty per cent greater than that of the former. It is easy to see now why overproduction in any one year is usually followed by a shy crop the next. The tree is so determined to mature the large crop set, that all its energy is concentrated in that direction, with the result that there is no surplus for the formation of fruit buds; and next spring at blooming time its flowers are conspicuous by their absence. This year its energies are directed to the production of fruit buds and then the process is repeated. But alternate bearing is not the only undesirable result of overproduction. The heavily loaded branches frequently break under the strain; the fruit is likely to be small, poorly colored and the per cent of culls large. What practical means can be employed to regulate the bearing habits of the orchard? The answer of necessity must be indefinite </seg>
            <seg id="p078">78 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY E:ause of the great variations in orchards, soils, the age of the trees. i varieties, etc. However, a few general principles apply to all. Over - tdiiction must be prevented and the trees must be kept at their best production. The former resolves itself into judicious pruning and some cases thinning; the latter into conserving the moisture in the 1, increasing the available plant food and controlling the insect and igus pests. Pruning to Regulate Bearing. In the well cared for orchard, systematic annual pruning can, with most varieties, be depended upon to prevent overbearing. If a tree has too much bearing wood, a thorough thinning out of the top and center will usually be sufficient pruning. If the main or scaffold branches are well distributed, large limbs need not be removed; the bearing wood can be decreased equally as much by thinning out branches the size of a man's finger or a little larger, and the danger of doing per - manent injury to the tree is much less. When the trees are old, thickly branched and diseased, a more severe treatment is necessary to rouse them out of their shiftless habit of bearing fruit every other year. Pruning cannot be confined to the removal of the small branches only. One usually finds large branches dead of" diseased, or rubbing, or crowding each other for light, so that it is impossible to avoid the making of large wounds. It is not at all unusual to find that from one-fifth to one-fourth of the top needs to be removed. Such pruning, however, should be done during the dormant season just previous to a prospective large crop, to produce the desired effect upon the bearing habits of the tree. Heavy pruning usually stimulates wood growth; however, if done as indicated above, the fruit will receive the big share of the stimulation, and much of the remainders will be used by the tree during the latter part of the season for the production of fruit buds for next year's crop. Suckers will be sent out in great numbers after a severe pruning, and will have to be removed. The easiest and cheapest method of removing suckers is to hire a bunch of boys in the latter part of June, have them wear gloves and rubbed soled shoes and see that they pull them off. In this manner, the energies of the tree are turned toward fruit production. If these suckers are allowed to grow all summer long, it is not only a waste of energy on the part of the tree, but also on the part of the orchard owner or whoever else re - ceives the job of pruning the next winter. Thinning and Its Relation to Regulating the Bearing Habit-. tThe practice of thinning has long been followed by fruit growers Europe and with them, off years are scarce (except of course in that rt of Europe where the thinning is done by shrapnel and shells), ich growers in this country have been thinning for over a decade </seg>

Superior fruit can not be produced on a tree that is overloaded. A tree's bearing capacity is limited, and no matter how many fruits are set, that capacity can not be exceeded. If a tree has set more fruits than it can possibly mature to normal size, all of them suffer. If, on the other hand, one-half or two-thirds of the young fruits are removed, those that remain have a far better chance to develop nor - mally. The practice is not wasteful. Experiments have shown that the total bulk is as great for the thinned as for the unthinned tree. Moreover, the vitality of the tree is conserved by reducing the num - ber of apples since it is not the size of the fruit but the number of maturing seeds that causes a drain on the vitality of the tree. Apples are thinned when they are the size of small crab apples, or about the latter part of June. Help at this time is usually plentiful. Women and children can do the work easily and efficiently with proper super - vision. Let us see how thinning regulates bearing. The apples are usually thinned to five or six inches apart. This will, of course, necessitate the removal of all fruits from some spurs and these spurs will produce fruit buds that year and apples the following year. In Nebraska only those varieties needs to be thinned which have the habit of overbearing and only in those years when the trees have set more fruits than they can mature to good marketable size. Such varieties as Ben Davis. C.ano. Grimes, Jonathan, etc., with a little systematic pruning require no thinning. Genet, Winesap, Wealthy. Missouri Pippin, and other confirmed alternate bearers require in addi - tion an occasional thinning. It occasionally happens that a late spring frost kills all the blos - soms on some varieties, or in exceptional years on all varieties. Not having any fruit to nourish that year, the trees naturally turn all their energies toward fruit bud production. With favorable weather at fruit setting time, overproduction is bound to be the result, unless steps are taken to prevent it. Thinning is absolutely necessary in a case like this in order to escape the dangers accompanying overproduc - tion. Thinning will not pay unless such orchard operations as spray - ing, pruning and cultivation are systematically practiced, so that the capacity of the trees for bearing is kept at a high level. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">82 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Spraying in It* Relation to the Rearing Habits Spraying with us in Nebraska is resorted to generally in order to control those pests which attack the fruit and either make it unfit for human use or injure it to such an extent that its market value is considerably reduced. Our main object then, is to produce clean fruit. There is another phase of spraying, the importance of which is usually underestimated. I am referring to the control of pests attacking the foliage of the apple trees. The leaves are frequently called the lungs of the tree. They are; but they are likewise the stomach, for they make the food necessary for the production of fruit and fruit buds. If the leaves are injured, naturally they can't produce the amount of food they might if healthy, and the capacity of the tree for producing or maturing fruit is lowered. The maximum of healthy foliage Is es - sential to the maturing of a good-sized crop of fruit and at the same time producing fruit buds for the following year's crop. Spraying in Nebraska is a comparatively simple matter since we do not have San Jose scab, plant lice and the red bug to contend with. Our worst foliage pest is apple scab which in very wet years defoliates our trees. Even in ordinary years we find in our demonstration orchards that trees not sprayed lose their foliage from two to four weeks earlier than the sprayed trees. We find too, during the grow - ing season that portions of the leaves turn brown and die. Apple scab is usually the criminal. I shall not discuss in detail the spray sched - ule for controlling apple scab or any of the other orchard pests. How - ever, it will do no harm to mention just one point in this respect, namely, the great importance of thoroughness in spraying. Too often one finds that the later sprays are directed only at the fruit; covering all the foliage when there is little fruit on the trees, is considered a waste of material and time. How little such orchardists appreciate the value of healthy foliage or they surely would not begrudge what little extra is required in the way of time and material to do a thor - ough job. Thoroughness in spraying means likewise, less danger from outbreaks of diseases in years favorable for such outbreaks. I will cite just one instance which has come under my observation, which will bear out what has been mentioned above. The season of 1915 was a most trying one for most orchardists in this state as most of you will remem - ber. Rain played havoc with spray schedules and spraying. That year the writer was doing some work in spraying in Mr. Gus Beaver's orchard near Ralston. Mr. Beaver had been spraying this orchard for six years and thoroughness is one of his slogans. At harvest time the unsprayed trees in his orchard showed only 12 r /r of apples injured by insect and fungus pests combined. A quarter of a mile east was an - other orchard which had not been sprayed. Here from 95 to lOO^ of the fruit was infected. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">REGULATING BEARING HAIMTS OF THK AI'I'LE ORCHARD 83 The I ml iii-iii I- of Cultural Methods on Steadiness of Yield. Uniformly high yields depend to a great degree on the treatment which the orchard soils receive. In some eastern states, certain sys - tems of sod culture have been found to yield as uniformly high crops as the best tillage systems. But climatic and soil conditions differ greatly from those found in this state. The experience of Ne - braska orchardists is that sod in the orchard is conducive to small apples, to biennial crops and that it invites that dreaded disease, blister canker, of which we will hear more during the course of these meetings. Some sort of tillage is absolutely necessary to guard against the evil effects of droughts and to keep the trees supplied with all the plant food they need. There is no one best soil treatment for all orchards; however, experiments in this state and Iowa have shown that for the bearing orchard a system consisting of alternate clean tillage and red clover is best. Continuous cultivation is detrimental since it removes the humus and absence of humus means lack of water holding capacity and washing. The clover does not draw upon the soil for moisture that a bluegrass sod does, and when plowed or disced under, furnishes the vegetable matter or humus which is so necessary to make a good moisture holding soil. This system will have to be modified or changed entirely to meet the requirements of the individual orchard. In steep orchards It might be advisable ot leave strips of sod to prevent washing of soil. The young orchard just coming into bearing needs to be checked in its growth usually and it may be advisable in this case to allow a light sod to remain temporarily. The old neglected sod orchard presents still another problem in soil management. The heavy pruning which is usually necessary la this case has a tendency to throw the tree into wood bearing, a thing which is undesirable since it causes irregularity in bearing and increases the expense of pruning in subsequent years. Turning the sod under will overcome this tendency to wood growth in that the plowing, even though shallow, will cut many feeding roots and thus decrease the amount of food material which the tree can take up. In the well kept orchard, injuring the root system of the trees is decidedly detrimental to steadiness in yield. But there is little danger that the feeding roots will be too close to the surface in the well kept orchard since stirring the soil with disc or plow sends the roots down. In conclusion, the methods of regulating the bearing habits of the apple orchard may be summarized as follows: Overproduction results in biennial bearing which is undesirable, both from the standpoint of the commercial grower as well as from the standpoint of the home orchardist. Proper pruning and an occasional thinning, are practical means of preventing overproduction. </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Uniform high yields are impossible unless the food and moisture supply are kept up. Orchard pests should be controlled, attention being given not only to the pests affecting the fruit, but also to those affecting the leaves. Some system of orchard tillage should be used which will con - serve moisture in the soil, prevent washing, keep up the humus con - tent and the plant food necessary tor good growth. A good annual wood growth is correlated with high yields. Tillage under normal conditions should be shallow to prevent in - juring the roots. Mr. Azendorf: I would like to know whether the pruning can in any way modify the bearing in certain varieties, in the Cenitian for instance? Mr. Hoppei t : Yes, 1 think it makes a difference. Tt bears in clusters even if you have not pruned it. But in order to get away from that alternate bearing habit you see after you have once gotten iway from that, and do these other things I think you won't have any trouble with alternate bearing; and thinning won't have to be done very often. But in Winesap we can «lo thai without thinning, jus! b) pruning, cultivation and sprayin Mr. William*: What kind of weather would you consider favor* for the setting of buds? A. Very cold weather or damp weather when the t just ready to fertilize. When we have a favorable spring there wil be more fruit set than can mature Mr. Williams: What process or treatment would you follow induce a larger and more regular setting? A. I think Mr. Keyser has discussed that. Of course you can't cultivate at the expense of late maturity of crops you see, and any process which will keep the trees producing at their maximum during the early part of the season will naturally have a tendency to produce truit buds at the same time as the maturing of the crop. Mr. Shubert. Do you not find that a good healthy foliage at that time almost insures the right conditions? A. Certainly. Mr. Keyser: Here is another thing. It takes two or three years to get those orchards that are old and neglected and have not been cared for, to producing a heavy crop. Men of long experience along that line all come to the same conclusion. It is a question of food material. Those buds are not strong enough to hold on have not food material enough to hold on. Some of the orchards have never been OK, u-&gt;i«h </seg>
            <seg id="p085">DISCUSSION 85 cultivated. The tree has strength enough to put out a heavy bloom. but when it goes to set in fruit, off they come. I think that paper of Mr. Hoppert's is a good one — it touched in the whole thing from start to finish. Chairman: I might say that it takes two or three years to make a neglected orchard get busy and do the proper thing. That con - tradicts some evidence that we have this year. I have in mind two orchards that have been neglected up to this year, and I know that they gave very excellent crops this year, not heavy crops, but fruit of excellent quality. I have reference to one orchard that Mr. Hazeltine worked in, and another near Murray. If there was ever an orchard that was Kiven neglect, that orchard had it. Yet I must say that the crop was one of the best I have ever seen in the state in any orchard. On a twenty-three acre orchard he harvested between six and eight thou - sand bushels of fruit of the first quality, and he did it simply with the treatment that he gave that orchard this year. I may add that this is on good land but the trees have been neglected. It was in sod and had not been pruned probably for years, and there is not the slightest doubt but that excellent crop was due to the treatment he gave it this year. I would like to hear Mr. Hazeltine tell of the condition of that orchard and the success he had. Mr. Hazeltine: That orchard had not produced a profitable crop for three years. It bloomed every year, but the blossoms either dropped off or the apples dropped off. That is on good land. I lay it to that and the spraying. We sprayed it just once this summer. Mr. Keyser. I can give you an example of a crop that had never been sprayed. There were very few worms and no scab in that orchard. It was a light crop, but a very good crop — some very clean and nice, and very few worms. At the same time if I leased that orchard and undertook to grow such fruit as I am exhibiting here. I would not expect to get it to doing good business under two years. We produced more apples in Wyoming on twelve trees than I har - vested on one hundred sixty trees out of this man's orchard. It takes rwo or three years to get the orchard started so that it will follow it up. I would tell anyone with an orchard like that, "Don't be dis - appointed now if you don't get good results the first year. You will get a lot of improvement, but not really good results until after the second or third year." Chairman: I did not mean to contradict Mr. Keyser. I believe just as fully as he does in the value of cululative treatment on an orchard. That is the most important thing. I am agreeing with you, but I was saying that the rapidity with which you could make an orchard grow depends to a great extent perhaps on the soil. I wu </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY rather trying to make the point of bringing out these illustrations. I think perhaps Mr. Hoppert did not emphasize that point quite as much as he might. That orchard thut he spoke of near Ralston, of Mr. Beaver's, given excellent care for six or seven years. He had some unsprayed plats in that orchard that year that had only 12 or 14% of apples injured by insect and fungus pests combined; and that was in the year 1915 when we had such outbreaks of diseases and pests, so that small percent on those unsprayed plats in that orchard means to me that it was small because that orchard has been given very excellent care for a period of years. He mentioned that in an orchard a quarter of a mile east which had not been sprayed, from 95 to 100% of the fruit was infected. There is a very cumulative effect in spray - ing, cultivation, and pruning — in other words, in looking after the health of the tree. Mr. Keyser. I am glad Mr. Hoppert brings that out about the spray calendar. We are apt to be misled lots of times figuring out spray calendars for ourselves. I am going to tell you an experience of a fruit company in Falls City. In the beginning they followed direc - tions, followed spray calendars which we know will work under most conditions most seasons. Their trees were in good condition, and it happened to be two or three years that we had no scab and one year they said, "What is the use of going to the expense of using that spray?" We drove into that orchard in 1914, the first year that we commenced to get scab bad, and they had to throw out nearly twenty per cent of that crop because they had invented a new schedule of their own. While they had a small per cent of fruit it was a bad year for scab in there, and they got caught in that particular instance. I think it is a pretty good plan to follow directions that we know will work under average conditions — not always be trying something new. Don't be fooled always by these cumulative results. Some orchards that have been sprayed a long time you can let them go, but at the same time you want to be pretty sure to keep pretty close to the spray calendar which we know will work under average conditions. Chairman: I think the suggestion is a good one, especially for a man that is of an experimental turn of mind. He is apt to be unable to get over all of his orchard and then note that there is very little injury in that portion of the orchard, and he might come to some wrong conclusion and say that spraying is not worth so much after all — which would cause him to lose the cumulative effect. Perhaps Mr. Azendorf can tell us something of the methods used with his tractors. Mr. Azendorf: Is there anything in particular that anyone wants to know? I was there one season with the man that used the tractor in the cultivation of his orchard, and I might say that it seemed as though the hotter the weather the more discing he got done. He had a long disc, but an extra big one, larger than a team could handle. </seg>
            <seg id="p087"/>
            <seg id="p088"/>
            <seg id="p089">DISCUSSIu.N 89 He hooked his engine to that, and then he took his extension disc and got in some work with the team. The disc ran day in and day out. In the summer of 1916, for several weeks it was unusually hot at har - vest time, and dry. In that orchard the team that was working there discing next to the trees was having a hard time of it. They could not work very fast. We had a big team and the disc did not give them much of a load, but they had a hard time of it. But the striking thing to me was the amount of work that he was getting done there in ■ given length of time just by using an engine instead of a team. There was no stopping to rest unless something should go wrong, and he had very little trouble, only on account of water connection playing out or something like that. It went at a faster gait than the team could pull it, and was going steadily all the time and kept at it all the day; and by having a larger disc than the four-horse team could handle, he covered a whole lot ot ground. I remember he and I were going along through the orchard and he made the remark that that was a mighty fine job, and it was, because after the team had gone along with the extension disc he had pretty well everything disced up. Mr. Marshall: Can he get as close to the tree? Mr. Azendorf: With some engines you could. I don't know as you could turn at the end. It would depend on how the orchard was planted. The ordinary orchard is not planted with that in view. He could not get so near some of his trees because his engine stands up a little higher than the team would necessarily be, but there are some engines I have seen at the Fair that would, and I think they would be just fine for that. Mr. Marshall: It looks like that would be the best way. Mr. Azendorf: He used the team too, because he has so much orchard there that he could use them to advantage. One thing in regard to inventing a new system of spraying to suit your own notion. I did a trick of that kind last summer, and was forced to do it because the sprayer came late and one or two other things went wrong. I did not get the first spray all on before blos - som time and had to quit, but the second and third sprays were all put on alike all over; and you could not tell the difference in the orchard. I am inclined to think that those people would be just like some he was talking about. If a certain thing panned out one year they would say, "Why not do it all the time," I did not advertise the fact that part of that field had only been sprayed twice. The orchard had been, thoroughly sprayed for a series of years before and 1 attribute it to that that it was fully as clean in the unsprayed part as in that where it was sprayed for three times. Mr. Marshall: I want to ask a question which is just a little off the subject, while we have Mr. Hoppert and others here who might be able to answer it. </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTIKAL SOCIETY In planting out a young orchard that you desire to bring into bearing as quickly as possible, or as quickly as was good for the trees, how would be the best way to handle that? Should it be forced by good cultivation for four or five or six years and then cultivation stopped and some crop sown into the orchard that had a tendency to check growth? Would that throw the orchard into bearing, and would the trees get any bad result from throwing it into bearing at a certain time? Would it be a profitable orchard afterwards, or had it better be allowed to come into bearing of Its own accord with mod - erate cultivation, and with no shock to the trees before it began bearing? Chairman: I think that is a good question to ask I don't know whether anyone could answer it or not. So I don't know whether it would be worth while, for me at least, to take any of your time to talk about it. 1 believe that that would vary somewhat with the nature of the land that orchard was on, Mr .Marshall. , Mr. Marshall. I was referring to the eastern part of Nebraska Chairman: I am of the opinion that red clover planted in an orchard when it was six or seven or eight years old would not be such a violent shock to that orchard, and I believe it would have a decided effect in causing it to set fruit buds, and I don't believe it would injure the trees. That would be my opinion. We had a portion of our variety orchard at the Station planted to red clover two years ago — some portions of it were then eight years of age and some of the trees seven. We had included in that I think about forty or fifty varieties. We are eoing to plow it up this year. It has been in now two growing seasons. Of course we only have two trees of each variety and I am not able to say whether we shocked those trees too much or not. Mr. Keyser: I make a motion that that question be laid on II table for ten years. Mr. C. G. Marshall: The reason I ask this question, we have been talking some of planting an orchard. The plan was to use standard varieties such as Jonothan and Winesap and others, and then using fillers — use Missouri Pippins for fillers. Now the idea I had in mind was to get these Missouri Pippins into bearing as soon as possible, that is, as soon as the trees were old enough so that they could bear a crop worth while, and I was wondering whether if we would give this orchard thorough cultivation and force the growth as much as possible, say during the first five years, and then if necessary to throw that orchard into bearing — sow even oats or rye, something that would have a tendency to give the trees a greater shock than red clover — would that make those trees bear and set fruit buds? Would it hurt the trees — their future productiveness? Would it be good practice in the opinion of you men who have had some experience or observation along that line? </seg>
            <seg id="p091">DISCUSSION 91 Chairman: Some of these older growers should be able to tell you something about that. My observation of Missouri Pippins is that you would have about as much luck in preventing them from bearing as you would in preventing a baby from crying. I don't think you could prevent them from bearing. Is that not true, Mr. Saundera? Mr. Saunders: When I set out my orchard I set out three rows of Missouri Pippins, sixty-live trees to the row. They were set in the spring of 1897, and in the spring of 1902 they averaged a bushel of apples to the tree, and they have only failed three full crops since then, and they are about as healthy a tree as I have in the orchard. Mr. Marshall: Do the apples run small? Mr. Saunders: No. Mr. Marshall. Your soil is somewhat different from ours. We can keep the orchard from bearing for ten or twelve years, but I don't think we could do that with the soil you have there by Brownville. You have not so much of the humus on top as we have. With good clean cultivation I doubt whether we could get Missouri Pippins into bearing even the fifth season unless we had a dry season or we had used some crop in there that was pulling pretty heavily on the soil. . Mr. Saunders: This was pretty good soil. As to the size of my Missouri Pippins: A year ago last fall I took some apples out to Auburn to put on exhibition. I had Missouri Pippins, Gano, Ben Davis, and, I think, Jonathan. I took first-premium on the Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis and Gano, and the Missouri Pippins were the largest of the three varieties. Chairman: That speaks pretty well for the Missouri Pippin. Mr. Marshall: Our Missouri Pippins are mere nubbins. Mr. Saunders: I have some in my cellar now that are better than three inches in diameter. Chairman: Ordinarily we think of the Genitian bearing nubbins 100 after it gets old, but (displays a large one) last year Mr. Keyser had fifteen or twenty plates of these apples, and he had difficulty in making people believe that they were Genitians. Those trees are twenty-two or twenty-four years old. This is encouraging to find that our growers can over come the notions that we thought were fixed things. We can overcome weaknesses in certain varieties. That is certainly encouraging. Mr. George Marshall: There is one thing about the Missouri Pippin. They are a tree that you ought to thin the fruit — take what fruit there is off when they start to bear. They will always make siie when the tree is young, but when the tree gets old they will not make the size. They will set from three to six or seven in a cluster — clusters about an inch apart; but they showed such a will that we had to cut them out. Before we tried thinning we would get ten or fifteen per- </seg>
            <seg id="p092">92 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY cent big enough to go into the barrels. Then we tried an experiment thinning, and ordinarily you ought to cut the fruit off of about every other cluster and then cut the others all off to one. Always cut to one because a fruit hanging alone will always blade better. With that you can grow a good average-sized fruit that you can get eighty or ninety percent of apples of a fair grade on trees I guess, no matter how old they are, as long as they will bear fruit. If you will go ahead and thin them you will be surprised how nice that fruit grades. You will get the color and the evenness in size and all that. The way Mr. Saunders spoke I thought he hadn't thinned them, but he got the size. Mr. Saunders: Those extra large apples grow on water sprouts three years old. Missouri Pippins last year were extra large for Pippins. Mr. Smith: I have a neighbor who has a goodly number of Mis - souri Pippin trees about twenty years old and this last year they were very full, and they did not grow much over an inch in diameter, and grew in clusters, and he found a market for them. He sold them for crab apples in market baskets and sold the whole crop. Chairman: I saw an orchard one year in Otoe County. The orchard had been in sod for ten years, and the man had sprayed the apples that particular year I have reference to, and one of the owners saw the crop in midsummer, or the latter part of the summer per - haps, and the apples could easily have passed for crabs. He sug- gested that they be kept until Thanksgiving and sold for cranb but the other owner would not do that. Mr. Shubert: I am very anxious to hear from Mr. Hoppert he has noticed any difference in the development when they are prun&lt; before the foliage is out or before the sap is up. or in May and Jut has made any difference in the development of the fruit spores of t foliage crop. Mr. Hoppert. I think what you are hinting at is that summer pruning pays. Well there are some rather contradictory evidences in that regard. I think the Oregon Experiment Station has published on it, and they find that there is very little difference between prun - ing in the summer time for fruit production, and pruning in the winter time. I have not personally observed any difference, or throwing a tree into fruit production by summer pruning. That is a theory that they have been working on in the West for a number of years, but we are hearing less of it now. Mr. Keyser: I wanted to ask Mr. Shubert a question. Whether he meant it or not I am not sure, but he said that it took about twelve years to get an apple tree to bearing a profitable crop. I have been telling people that you could get trees to bearing in eight years, and I had also understood you to say that your orchard on the old home place bad been paying profitable crops since the trees were eight </seg>
            <seg id="p093">DISCUSSION 93 years old, in private conversation. I think that you must be mistaken about the twelve years. Mr. Shubert: You must be mistaken. I don't think I ever said I had an eight year old orchard in good bearing. The ninth year has paid me a fairly good rental. I think that I have noticed in my observation that there is more good growth in the pruning before the sap comes up, and I think that I have noticed in the pruning in May and June after the foliage is out that there are not nearly so many water sprouts come up, and I rather think it is in favor of the fruit spores rather than a wood growth. Mr. Hoppert: That is all that I know about it. We have not done anything with that at the Station. Chairman: We have started an experiment that I hope will throw some light on that, Mr. Shubert. We are prone to say we can't answer your questions, but next year probably can, but we have started an experiment with that in mind. Year before last we added to our variety orchard seventy new varieties that we did not have in the oroiiard, and we planted two trees of each variety. One of the main tests that we are going to make in this variety orchard, in addition to testing the fruit, is to be a pruning test. We are starting out from the first year to prune one of those varieties dur - ing the dormant season and the other during the growing season. In fortunately we only have two trees of each variety. We could multi - ply that and have three or four checks if we had sufficient number of trees of each variety, but unfortunately we have not. We hope to do this from the beginning until they reach maturity. We ought to be able to have some rather reliable information on that if it is carried out. iind I am going to try to see to it that it is carried out. It will bo interesting to note the effect on that many varieties. That will be interesting, and then taken all together, it ought to throw some infor - mation on it as a general proposition. Motion for adjournment for the day made and carried. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">94 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Wednesday Forenoon, January 16. Meeting called to order with President Howard in the Chair. tThe first topic on our program this morning is "Some of the Fac - ; That Determine Whether Apples Should Be Packed or Sold in It," by Professor Albert Dickens, of Manhattan, Kansas. SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE WHETHER APPLES SHOULD BE PACKED OR SOLD IN BULK Albert Dickens Just at this time of the world and this time of the development the fruit industry of this middle west section, we have this ques - on and a good many other questions that come up quite pertinently at lis time. What are the factors that determine this and that and the ther? That phrase comes up always and eternally in answering any uestions in regard to any of those agricultural industries. But I tarted to say that it depends on the apples and on the market and on he men. Where do these apples go, and what are these apples destined o do in the food use of this country? Where are they going — and the ling that strikes me is that we ought to arrange for — the thyig that e are trying to arrange for in settling this and other questions in the istribution is to know more of the men to whom that fruit is going, and more of the localities in which it is to be consumed; and it is jssible, I think, for the development of the distribution of fruit. We are having at this time the advantage of more machinery, nd the advantage of more help in getting information concerning the ifferent locations, and the demands for these products, than ever efore. It is a question of necessity. There never was a time when e could have spent the money to get the information concerning the se of food that we now do. There has never been the time perhaps when it was advantageous to the grower to know all about the markets n which his fruit is to sell so much as it is now. That question of roduct and quality is one of the first things that we must consider, because one of the first things that any fruit locality needs to do — any state or any section needs to do — is to fix a standard so that you and the man you are talking to both use the same terms. The standardization of products is a phrase that is easily rolled rom the tongue, but it is not as easy a thing to do when you come o find out what an apple of a given brand is, or a brand of straw - berries or raspberries or grapes. What one man calls a Number One, another man would call a Number Two, and another a Number Three, tc. If a carload of apples comes into a community from one section f the state and sold as "Fancy" or "Choice" or "Standard," and then </seg>

The names have been used all too loosely in every market. The attempts of Legislature to fix these grades have not worked very satisfactorily. I think that we don't use our terms with anything like the exactness and certainty that the live stock men use their terms. For instance, when your cattlemen read this morning that export steers brought such and such a price, and that common butcher stock brought such a price, the idea that those words represent is pretty nearly definite to that cattleman who knows just about the grade of finish that those cattle have had. and knows just about how they were killed, etc., and so the buyers and sellers have looked over the terms and gotten together. The ii&lt;&lt;U" knows just how those caitle are to be classed before they to market. The fruit business must be stabilized and stand - iized so that a man who had a grade of fruit can say to a buyer to a buyers' Association that he has so many cars or so many bushels or so many barrels of this certain grade of fruit and so many of that grade, and so many of the other so there won't be so much chilling disappointment as so often happens to a man who has bought a box of apples and finds that his idea and the idea of the man who packed those apples are a very great distance apart. It sounds as though it ought to be a very easy thing to do, to fix standards, but as a matter of fact the supply and demand have had a great deal to do in the adjustment and varrying of these grades. You take a year like two years ago, when everybody had lots of apples, and we all knew that apples were very plentiful, when we knew that they had to be right good stuff if they .were going to get by, and pay for the storage anil packing and help, and the cider barrel was filled much more generously and often, and we put in a pretty fair standard grade. Then you take a year when apples are scarce and everybody needs apples and wants them, and we keep checking over until we have hurt our grades very considerably and we have to fix a grade that would sell at a price that the market seemed to demand. Now it seems to me, and it seems to prove out in the markets, that that is lot very good busines It is not very good business, for instance, if we have had one of those years when the schedules of the entomologists have not worked out fttg exactly, and we have more worms than we should have, and there are apples that come on late that are pretty good apples that the coddling moth did not take any of until August and September and has not used very much of, and the longer you look at that apple the better it seems to you. and you slip it over into the "Fancy" barrel. </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Now then if a certain locality gets those apples, and they are good looking apples, with a good price on them, they think they are get - ting an apple worth while to put on the table; when the post-mortem discloses that there is an intruder in that apple, the buyer has lost his appetite for apples. They are all right for the kitchen, and for the cider barrel, and for pies and the apple machine. The housewife knows the worms are there. In the years when the markets have been good we have lowered our grades and have put stuff on the market under a grade name that should never have gone. That is one thing that hurts every locality. I don't know who is going to fix these names, but * imagine the Horticultural Societies are going to have more to do with that than anybody else. If you ever tried to get the Legisla - ture to do anything of that sort you will realize that most of them want to do the best for the consumer and producer, and ordinarily the producer was represented by a bunch of fellows from the Horticul - ure Society, and the consumer was represented by a bunch from the Commission House, and they didn't pet very close together. The longer we live the more we realize that the thing to do in business of any sort whether it is selling apples or anything else, is just to tell the truth. I have a good old friend down in Kansas who got a little enthusiastic about the market, and said, "Boys you can't get away from the fact that honesty i&gt;- the best policy. I know, I have tried both ways." That is true of a good many apple commissions and commission men they have tried both ways, and the nearer we can get to the consumer with the fact that we are giving him, just as nearly as any man can estimate, the thins that we are putting on Hit - tag of the barrels, the better it is going to be for the fruit business It may help the first shipment a little to wire ahead and tell them that they are a little extra fancy, hut it doesn't help the next carload, and it doesn't help the next season's shipment, and it doesn't help the standard of that Fruit Association. A pood many Hint associations have gone on the rocks just on the question of that making of grades — basing of stock. It is a hard question. You have hurt the busi - ness every time you lie about it, and we find out too often that we have tried both ways — both ways in the same car sometimes, and it doesn't pay. We have to have the confidence of the man who is going to eat that fruit finally. There is no reason why just because the demand is extra good that we should call those common apples fancy apples. We may just as well put up the market for more money, as the cattlemen did twenty years ago. and the prices raised on certain grades. There is no reason why we .should not put up the prices on fruits than there is for cattlemen to say that if they are bringing seven cents they are export steers. The proposition is one for the State Associations and Horticul - ture Societies, or men who are leading in their community. It is a hard thing to do, I know, to grade this stuff and be strict and honest </seg>
            <seg id="p099">APPLES PACKED OR IN BULK 99 about it, but it must be done if we are going to stay in the business. But apples are a cheap horticultural crop down in Kansas, and both Kansas and Nebraska have a lot of good market territory, and a man who owns apple orchard land in any of these middle west states has a mighty good thing, because there is a lot of land in these states that does not raise good apples. All the man with good apple territory has to do is to raise apples, and he has the freight rates in his favor if he raises good apples. Of course he has enough things against him — the worms and hailstorms and changeability of the weather and frosts, etc., so that he ought to have something coming to him; and he has, because he has the location right. Any state like Kansas that raises $50 worth of beef and wheat and corn and pork and horses and alfalfa where they raise $1 worth of apples, has the market where they can send apples; and we have over-played that thing many times in not realizing that those buyers would pay more for certain apples if they were just sure that they were better. The question of bulk trade is giving a great deal of trouble to most of the apple men. I saw one fellow from Oklahoma where they had plenty of money and wanted bulk apples from our town, and did not know anything about apples. This man came up to buy some bulk apples. He went and looked in a car where we were loading some cider apples for the vinegar works down in Topeka and were to get forty cents a hundred, providing there were no soft apples — and they had everything else but soft rot. There were a lot of little apples, but they had been culled over pretty well and the car of apples looked pretty good. The man who was loading the car had always been crooked — had never tried the other way. That was the reason he had never gotten anywhere. He was working for $1.50 a day and was over forty years old. The man from Oklahoma came and asked what he wanted for the apples and he did not answer until he found out who the other man was. and where from and what he wanted. So he found out that the man would pay fifty cents a bushel for that stuff, and the outcome of it was that the man bought it. The other fellows agreed, of course. They were trying one way at any rate that day, and the man went out of there with seven or eight hundred bushels of cider apples, and he got stuck when he got home. A good bulk apple on the track that year was pretty well sold in the same town, and that man figured, and figured rightly, that he was like the man who went down to Jerico and fell among thieves. So after that, those people down in that Oklahoma locality did not buy from our town again. They said, "The apples up there are awful. We tried them once," and they said they didn't want anything to do with apples from that part of the country. They got a carload from the Arkansas Val - ley that year that was good stuff in Oklahoma, and consequently the Arkansas Valley to those boys is the apple part of Kansas, and the northeastern part doesn't do any business with them. </seg>

Now honest confession is good for the soul, and that hurt that community, but I have not sold cider apples for bulk apples very lately. It doesn't pay. They had better go to the cider mill and go to the vinegar works- so where they belong always. Now we have sold a lot of little apples out West. Take a year when the wheat crop is not a buiiipft and the kaffier corn is hit by the frost and folks feel a little too hard up. you can send a carload of mighty poor apples out to that shortgrass country, and the people think they have some apples, but they ought to know that those apples are culls, and that word "cull" ought not to mean that the apple is fit for anything but a low grade appie If any man thinks of a better word for culls let him find it I find out that in a good ni.nn localities the "orchard run" is the stuff that run out from the tablf the barrels, not good enough to get into the barrel and run b and I hat is what they mean by orchard run, and I reckon that is wlut the word ought to mean If a man is a right good iealei will sort his apples and makf some money.

We have always said that it was none of th man's business after he had the apples and we had the money But wt have made some mistakes in our con Hry in thai way. We give a community a bunch of apples that they shouldn't have. I remember one time men going down to our section and saying that there were forty families that wanted about fifteen bushels of apples apiece, and he was going to load out a right nice car. That was fifteen or eighteen years ago. That man went out of fttti with some Autumn Strawberry and Jonathan and Grimes Golden, and did not have anything that those people could keep very long. I was in that community a year or so afterward on Farmers Institute work, and suggested something about the community shipping of apples, and one woman said, "Not for us. We tried that one Fall, and the women did nothing but can apples for a month. That was the only way to keep them." They were using the </seg>

That man half of those apples to can, but they ought to and Ben Davis so that they could put them Christmas time, but every family was soon pples and the la^i fresh apple was gone before Thanksgiving did not have a right good notion of community that experience. They had not bought them were not sold right. That is the question that on of selling them right, and if the community &gt;i&lt;ause you have sold them right. We say fre - ly of our business who gets them, but it is. t commission man put in one whole summer in A .Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta, Albany, Jackson- points, t tying to find out who was going to use \i rear, and to see that the men who consumed those pay too much for them. He found out that the apples d the track at Spokane, were being sold at $4.00 a }■•■ other points. That was their business, they put those apples on the track and pay the interest on their t they were getting for those apples. When you r four thousand dollars an acre it is a big proposi- ■ water in that land up there and they have he last three or four years. But those men were interested in finding out about the markets in the freight rate was fifty-five cents from their own to Memphis, and that made those apples that Spokane sell for $1.80 on the track at Memphis before il. and the storage man got fifteen cents a box which II. IS; and who was going to get the rest of that? out and sell him ten acres of orchard for $30,000, km his interest on the investment he has to keep a working if he keeps his head above water.

I have seen apples rotting in Kansas, ard then been in pome of those hip cities in the East and seen boys and girls going to school, and not one of them carrying an apple to eat at recess. It is our business, as apple growers, to see that there is a market for a lot of bulk apples in those big cities. If we have got a lot of second grade apples and our market at home is good enough so that everybody has money and the extra fancy apples are what they want, what are we going to do with those lower grades? Because we will have them with us always. We cannot pick those apples out as the man does who has four or five acres of orchard and spends a lot of mbney on help. We have not got to that point.

Our North- east counties use barrels almost entirely are just beginning to box some of them. The Arkansas Valley has not barrelled ten bushels where they ha\e boxed one hundred for the past few years. This Northeast trade that used barrels want bands. We don't care, if we can get barrels we will give them barrels, but if il comes too high and the cost gets too much then any boy or girl can make the apple boxes. and we can get them perhaps out of our own native lumber.

You can't get away with a lie, and if you get a little more money for those first few cars they will find it out later on and you will suffer for it the next Spring; and then again you will suffer for it next Fall. The cheapest apples in our locality were bought by the men who were stung the year before when they paid big prices for them. They had that balance coming to them and they were going to even it up some way, and they did. They had bought apples in Maine for $2.50 a barrel in the orchard and the freight and storage, and found out that everybody had been figuring on ■ short crop. It was a little short, but they had a lot in storage because the boys had lied about the crop that year to get the price up; and then we had that stuff in there, and what happened? They got the notion that apples were short, and the housewife didn't eat apples and bought oranges with the notion that apples were high; and then about the first of March they were lower than they had ever been; and the apples from Maine brought $1.60 in Kansas City in the Spring. The next year the buyers remembered that and wouldn't pay. The question, "Where are you going to store your apples," is one the things that enters into the question of marketing apples. We can't plan too far ahead in the that has already been suggested ing the men who are going to us storage business. One of the things is that we know the facts concern - le the storage. For instance, a stor - agent that it is none of his business but they made it their business last ;ot into a little trouble because they aged," and the said, "Yes," and he six fellows who had not engaged it, age man may tell a government who is going to use his storage, Fall. I know of one man who i him, "Is this storage ens them the names of five or and he has not gotten through apologizing yet. Some of the fellows were planning to use that storage and then hold their apples as long as they could. It does help to know how many apples you are going to have for storage just as soon as you can tell. There is not any crop, perhaps, that is as hard to estimate as an apple crop. I have seen a man with an apple orchard who had ten thousand boxes for apples in the sh6d that was busy for the next two or three weeks hauling cider apples, and his boxes were left over for the next year; and that man's estimate went for nothing. But ordinarily if we spread out over territory enough we do know, and it is our business to know and we ought to know, and the New York apple grower ought to want to know what the apple conditions are in this country because it is our business to pro - vide this eating public with apples. The sooner we get into the notion that we are in the business with a lot of these other fellows and that it is our business to provide apples for this country, the better we will get away with it; and the sooner we know the storage capacity of the country and the storage capacity that the individuals have who have a little home storage, the better we will conduct the business. </seg>

There is many a housewife that has an idea that a baked apple is a luxury and a baked potato a food. But if she will fill that boy of hers up with a baked apple he will go out feeling that he is better fed than if he had eaten two baked potatoes. Your Horticulture Society is reporting these facts, and those are the things that are going to determine what we are going to do with these apples. We must consider the benefit of the community to which they go and the benefit of the community from which they come. NM we must look out for our own interests. The man who takes class care of Number One, of the wife and children, is the man who is having money enough to buy liberty bonds and subscribing to the Ked Cross, and buying Baby Bonds, because he has taken care of Num- her One. and we want every man to take care of his own family. We don't want any man to do work for nothing. The more that the world knows about the size of the apple crop, and about the varieties grown and the quality, the less stuff we will have to put into storage, and the less the housewife will have to go short on apples after the first of March. If we have lots of that stuff, then one of these days we are yoing to have a war move in those warehouses so that we can get them ready before we sent them out. That is the proposition in the citrus industry. 1 saw men bringing lemons from California and put- ting them into warm rooms, and a man said, "This is the first time that was ever done. There is a shortage. Italy was short last year and Spain was short, and the lemons are worthy forty-five cents a dozen • very where and we are going to cover them up." But they were getting them out right, because they knew the number of lemons that were imported, and the number in the warehouses all over the state of Cali - fornia and other sections that grew lemons wherever it might be; and those are the points that it seems to me we need in building up our horticulture societies and our Department of Agriculture. First, there should be a man right at the spray wagon and the picking sack that is willing to tell the cost the best that he knows. and there is room there lor expert estimates in every community. You all know men that have guessed within five hundred bushels of the apples that they will have on an acre, and you have known men that cannot estimate at all. There is need of the men that can estimate the amount of apples so that Kansas may know, and Missouri may know, the amount of apples that they will produce. If everyone has apples, then the thing to do is to get them into market and get them baked and canned and made into apple butter. We are getting a start on that proposition right now with the Food </seg>

We have needed that move, and we have needed an administration that would tell people, "You ought to eat more apples." The potato crop was short in Maine and people were told about it in California and told to substitute something for potatoes. That is the last word that I have to give you, I think, is this roposition of knowing as early as we can in the season about what lnd of apples we have, the amount, and the grade we have, to have n agreement on the grade terms, and then know the need of the ommunity and the ability of the community to consume apples or rawberries or peaches, or whatever it may be; but it is our business furnish the world fruit.

He was back a thousand miles from transportation, and le said that if they just could have gotten the notion there that there as money in the world, they could have built a transportation line tat would have meant more for the development of China and India an anything has done for centuries. I have seen the time when ley said we raised too much corn and beef and wheat. I can remem - »er too that it was only a year from that time when we were begging oney to help out the famine sufferers in India. These crops should lave been put away so that they would keep. The world should have ore than the day-after-toinorrow's food supply.

For instance, we had something over two million apple trees sometime ago, and in recent years the estimate puts it at least one - third less, In spite of the fact that we have a lot of recent plantings throughout the state. You are acquainted with the loss of trees J. R. Cooper </seg>
            <seg id="p115">CANKER CONTROL 115 throughout our state. I find that this loss is correspondingly great throughout all of the Middle Western states. In fact, the Middle West has suffered more damage than any other section. This loss is due to one great thing in particular, and one lesser factor. The largest factor which goes to help in this destructiveness is the planting of certain varieties which we have had planted to such extent in this Middle West. The Ben Davis apple tree is the cause of a lot of this loss. Wherever we find it predominating, there we And more damage than anywhere else. The Ben Davis has been one of our greatest varieties, but it is an established fact that it is more susceptible to canker than any other variety we have, with one or two exceptions; and it is in those plantings where we have the susceptible varieties predominating that we have the greatest destructiveness from canker. I might say that in arriving at these conclusions we studied the orchard conditions all over this state and Kansas and adjoining states, and in addition, shipped in a large amount of nursery stock. We inocu - lated bearing trees artificially, and went over three thousand of Illinois cankers, in order to study the disease. What lead to this phase of the work was that when we started the canker treatments in order to evolve a way of controlling the disease, we thought the next year we would make a fair success at least. We found our treatments holding in good shape, and the trees apparently coming along nicely. The next year we were a little disappointed as some were showing cankers along the edges. We tried to believe that this was new inoculations, but by the time another season had passed we gave it all up. We knew absolutely that it was old canker breaking out in a new place, and we telt that we could not have hope to control it by that method of treat- nent. That lead to a life study of the disease in order to know xactly what the disease was. That wa3 what lead to all of these inocu- lations. We attempted to make inoculations in every way possible. We scaled off bark; we went to the deeper end of the tree; we sprayed the pores on the growing surface; we sprayed the surface on places where we scraped the top of the bark off and we placed it with every year's growth of wood from one year old on down in order to tell exactly when and where and how the disease came. We found a few facts at least. We found that it was a pruning wound parasite that could not penetrate bark until we made a way for it by making a wound; if the wound only extended to the cam - bium layer, it would practically never produce infection. The next year's wood was resistant, but not to such an extent, and so on down until we got to four and five year old wood, and from then on all the differentiations were alike — they were all susceptible. Most of the activity of the tree is carried on in the last four or five layers of wood to be formed. Those are still active and are more or less resistant, so that the deeper the wound in the tree, the older the wood that is </seg>
            <seg id="p116">116 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY exposed, the more liable there is going to be of infection from that inoculation. We also found that frost cracks would admit of infec - tion. We found that the small pruning wounds were very resistant, but one of the main things that we found was this great difference in the variety. We inoculated the young varieties artificially; guaged the susceptibility as well as the number of trees actually infected. We found that there was all the difference in the world. Some varieties are practically immune — that is, the disease travels so very slowly that they will almost live forever if you give them ordinary cultural care. We found Ben Davis, Delicious, Gano and Yellow Transparent as being the most susceptible of the list. We have some six year old Delicious in our orchard now — about twenty. We didn't inoculate those trees, but there are about two trees of that bunch that are not infected with canker at the present time. Delicious apparently is just as sus - ceptible as Ben Davis; but we have a number of intermediate varieties that we don't need to fear canker for, to a great extent. Jonathan and the light varieties are just resistant enough so that we can keep them growing fast enough so that they keep ahead of the fungus. Canker control is coming just to that point where we must choose our varieties to plant. If we choose varieties to plant that are resist - ant, and give the trees good cultural care and do most of the pruning while they are young, we can control the canker. We can't hope to control it in these old orchards which are already badly infected in susceptible trees, but we must depend on the newer orchards and the better varieties of trees. I have had made a number of lantern slides of different phases of the work that will give you a good idea of what we are up against. Lantern slides shown. DbtcusHkw Mr. Pollard: Then if we have the cankered trees in our orchards we had just as well give it up? A. No, sir. If you have Jonathan trees and Winesap trees, which are resistant no matter if they are cankered in the center, you can expect them to go on for years with a very good crop if you give them any decent care at all; but if your orchard consists of Ben Davis trees, it is different. Mr. Pollard: In our ochard I notice that in trees that appear per - fectly healthy as far as any outward appearance is concerned, that when they are heavily laden with fruit oftentimes a limb breaks, and almost invariably the wood tissue is not healthy — it is not clear, bright wood like we expect to find in a healthy tree. Now that is a sort of a light, yellowish color — hasn't the white, bright appearance that a healthy limb has. I don't know how to describe it unless I would call it a </seg>
            <seg id="p117">DISCUSSION 117 kind of a lightish yellow-gray — not healthy. Do you suppose that is canker? A. Of course you might have a tendency to call almost anything canker, but we are safe in saying — in diagnosing the trouble as canker. Mr. Pollard: I notice that over the orchard, and it is not confined to any one variety. A. Perhaps you will find that true. Maybe I didn't make it quite plain enough, but the wood that is several years old in any of the varieties is much more susceptible than in the newer, and the new growth of Jonathan varieties and varieties semi-resistant will keep themselves free for years, while the hard wood will be entirely dis - eased. As long as you keep healthy wood on the outside of your tree it will be perfectly healthy. Mr. Sheldon. In digging up a Ben Davis tree or Winesap or Jon - athan, is there not more wood on the Winesap than on the Ben Davis. \. I don't know. It would take the examination of quite a large iniber of trees of fruit to find out. I don't know. Mr. Sheldon: There might be such a thing as lack of moisture that causes the Ben Davis to flight more. I don't mean on the outer limbs of the tree. A. It might be possible. Mr. Keyser: What do you think is the worst, most serious source infection. How do they carry — by the wind, or what? A. They are carried to a great degree by the wind; also more or less in cultivation, and when we carry the pruning through the orchard they are scattered that way. Mr. George Marshall: How far down the body of the tree will A. It will stop and hesitate for quite a while when it cornea to the union of the side with the old stock. The nurserymen are going to run across this question, "What stock is more resistant to canker than others." I used the Vermont seedlings, the French seedlings and the seedlings that we get from ordinary apple seedlings, and in the amount of variation in resistance to canker, we find one about as bad as the other. You will find in one that the canker will run down to the smallest roots and in another you find that the root is almost absolutely resistant. There is all sorts of variation there. That shows though, to a great extent, why some suffer more than others. They are set on roots that are different in resistance. Mr. George Marshall: Will you give us some information about the varieties that you have in mind, and then about how to manage the wound when you do the pruning on a sound tree? A. First of all, I think a man ought, under all conditions, to carry along a can of kerosene so that if he cuts into diseased wood </seg>
            <seg id="p118">118 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY he may use that. Or you can drop in a little carbolic acid. We use a sponge or rag or something like that. Mr. George Marshall: How do you protect the wound then? Say you have not inoculated it yourself. A. We do it by using white lead or liquid asphaltiun — one is about as good as the other. Mr. Marshall: Must it be a perfect covering? A. Yes. It should be done right away — a thin covering at least and I think you will And a great deal of benefit in adding copper sulphate. Mr. Marshall: If you are pruning, say in March, is it particular that you do that painting that same day? A. No, I am glad you mentioned that. If the pruning is done at a time when germination will take place, and we won't find it taking place when the temperature i* below sixty, it won't hurt to let that wait awhile. Mr. Marshall: Does the germination take place any time through the summer? A. Practically any time. The winter spores that we talk about, that are formed in the sacs, I picked a lurge quantity of them when 1 first began the work. 1 made tests of those every three months for three years, and some of those spores germinated alter three years, in a laboratory. They grew only a few minutes and then dried up within a year or so. The summer spores wont do that. Mr. Marshall -.They are liable to germinate any time during th summer? A. Yes, you will find them being formed at almost any time dur - ing the summer when we have a humid atmosphere, especially on the north side of the trees. You won't find them producing spores in any great quantities when they can be struck direct by the sun. Mr. Smith. We take it for granted that orchards fifteen or twenty years old have more or less canker. Now it is quite essential then, I draw from your remarks, that those cuttings should all be taken out before the temperature comes up in the spring. A. I certainly would not leave them there over summer, because by the latter end of the summer you are almost sure to have the spores being formed somewhere on those limbs. Mr. Marshall: Would you prune every half inch or so and coat that wound on the tree? Is it essential to give a coating to the small wounds? A. You would have a hard time doing that on a forty acre orchard. On this young nursery stock we have been using all the way from two to five year old stock, and on that I don't find much </seg>

Mr. Marshall: Do you think it essential to coat those wounds in ing off the small limbs? A. Not unless it is close to the trunk of the tree. In both the ien Davis and Uano last year out of forty trees I found two infected 10111 inoculation that had come on during the summer. Mr. Shubert: A limb three years old would be very susceptible Id it? A. If you say two years you will be safer. Mr. Christy: Suppose you take grafts from a diseased tree? A. If you don't get any of the diseased wood, you are safe. Question: You are perfectly safe in using the scions over a year 1&lt;1 A. We went further than that. We wondered if it would be geminated with the nursery stock, so we made a large number ot ills and planted a lot of spores in every graft, wrapped some and some we did not. I have not gotten an infection from such a graft. We set two year old trees of this infected wood in blocks and wherever we did not cut the roots we did not get any infection there. The infec- n does not occur readily under the ground, not nearly so readily near the top. If we could get a resistant stock to use, I would not afraid to put my nursery trees in the orchard before I took out the any kind. Mr. Sheldon: That was what I was going to ask you. Would you plow that ground thoroughly, as deep as you could, before setting the t would you set the young trees right away A. I would set the young trees right away Mr. Keyser: What about the other diseases We have some other diseases; root rot, for instance. But so has not been reported in any destructive quantity at all in this tate. It might be in some other states, but so far we don't have it lere in destructive quantity. Mr. Marshall: Does the disease ever lie dormant? A. Never. We find quite a rapid progress from the time the inoculation is made right on up. The canker grows fastest at the time during the summer when the trees are making the least growth. After the tree begins to ripen fruit and we don't have rapid elongation of branches is when it is growing most rapidly. Mr. Marshall: You probably would come to the conclusion that these dry years might encourage the canker? A. It does a great deal. We planted trees in half barrels, cov - ered them with a heavy rubberoid cover to prevent evaporation, and </seg>

Those with plenty of water lived in good shape, but those with the least amount of water, the majority of them died from canker before the season was over. Mr. Pollard. What varieties are most resistant? A. Our list is rather short on account of lack of room and lack of number of trees to work with, but in the most resistant list we put Wealthy and a few Russian varieties from Russian stock, and Olden - burg or Duchess. In the Moderately resistant list, we have Jonathan, Winesap, Arkansas, Arkansas Black. Jaret, Minkler, Fameuse (Snow), Stayman, Virginia Beauty, Wolf River, Northwest Greening and Ma - linda. In the moderately susceptible, we have York, Willow Twig, Rome Beauty, Maiden Blush, Champion, Grimes, Missouri, Northern Spy, Chicago, Yates, King David and Walbridge.

There is room for air in all of this work, remember that because we have not had a great quantity of bearing trees to work with.

Yes, in a bearing ochard. the canker on Rome Beauty Mr. Keyser: On Snow? A. Yes. Mr. Smith: On Roman Stem? Tht A. I don't remember what my ;cords are on Roman very susceptible varieties were Delicious, Ben Davis, Gano, Yellow Transparent. Mr. Smith: If any of the nurserymen here have any Roman Stem, I want to get a few trees of them. Our home orchard if fifty years old now. Some years ago my mother was a widow and she knew a tree man who came there and canvassed the district and stopped there occa - sionally. He came up there quite a while and furnished her tret-, and among them he put in some Roman Stem, and of all the trees he gave us there are three of the Roman .Stem still alive, fifty years old, and they are the most delicious eating apple that we can possibly get. Every year I trade Winesap for Roman Stems, and I want to get a few to set out. You hardly see them any more. Chairman: Let us continue the discussion on the canker now. I feel that Professor Cooper has the knowledge that we have been want - ing on this canker and we should continue this discussion as long as there are questions. </seg>
            <seg id="p123">DISCI 123 There is one point that I would like to ask Professor Cooper, and that is this: When the question was asked regarding the disinfection of pruning tools I don't know whether the point was made clear or not as to whether or not they are advised to disinfect every time they cut a branch on a tree or whether it is only necessary when they cut into a canker. In other words, if they were to cut into a cankered limb only into the heartwood would there be any more danger of them getting an infection on that pruning tool than in their hand. A. Yes, they would. A number were made with sawdust, and we got canker just as readily there as we did the other way. I would not take any chances on cutting through discolored wood. Mr. Williams: How about the spreading of the disease in the heartwood ? A. The heartwood will carry it. The heartwood ceases to be active as far as the growth of the tree is concerned after four or flre years. Mr. Williams: But the spreading is done by the spores? A. Yes. Mr. Smith. Have your investigations thrown more light on Mr. Pollard's question? I have a Jonathan orchard about twelve years old, and I had ten trees where they just began to dry up like they were starved — the leaves turned yellow and then fell off. The first year they bore a crop and the last two years they are dying. The inside of the tree is dark colored wood and it runs out over the body of the tree within one-fourth of an inch of the surface — and they die. They don't show any blister canker. I remember going to that demonstration at the Iowa State College grounds near Council Bluffs. They blew out a tree with dynamite and found the same condition that exists in our district with the Jonathan trees. It is a serious thing among the Jon - athan trees, not only in my own orchard but in others. They don't show a good color. They have the same care and fertilization and ground, and all conditions exactly the same as the other trees. Mr. Marshall: Mr. Smith showed me those things. I remember the Secretary and I were over there and I just wanted to tell you then what I noticed and I stopped for something else and forgot to men - tion it afterwards. I had seen cases. like that where we did not know what was the matter with the tree. This tree that Mr. Smith showed we was an apparently healthy bark and I could not see why it was dying. It is dead now. But I have seen cases like that and it Is more frequently in the apple than in any other kind of grafted fruit. These cases we concluded were caused by being grafted on a seedling that happened to be tender, and a year had come along just right to weaken that seedling or kill it, and it was strong enough to hold the tree from breaking over; the root was dead and had ceased to take care of the tree; and I would have just liked to have seen that tree dug out </seg>
            <seg id="p124">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 124 then when it was dying, because that is the time to tell because you will find the root dead. The root may be a great deal nearer decayed than the top. That might not be the case, but I wondered if it was. There was not a thing that we could see above the ground that would cause those young trees to fall like that, and healthy ones all around. A. In a number of cases we found on hillsides where the roots had washed bare, root infection we found the primary cause rather than the top infection, and in the cases where we had a susceptible root that might happen. tMr. Marshall: That won't happen very often though. But if you re to grow a hundred trees, no matter where you got the seed, you have a hundred stages of harvest just as sure as you have the hundred trees. You have a hundred seedings, no two alike, and you have some that are tender every time. Professor Howard and Hoppert were up here and we dug out a lot of trees and found that there was a lot of difference in the hardiness of seedlings and on the average they were not so hardy as the scion wood. Chairman: We demonstrated that more conclusively by some work at the Station here. We grew dozens of trees on French crab stock, Vermont stock and some of them that severe winter were killed and others totally injured, and in all cases the roots around the scion wood was hardier than the roots from the stock, even the hardy stock.

In a number of our orchards the Grimes Golden have almost entirely disappeared. Mr. Sheldon. Is that where they have had care A. They have had the same care as the others </seg>
            <seg id="p125">125 Mr. Smith: I have a suggestion that I believe this is the proper place to tell now. It has been recommended that liquid asphaltum to paint with is preferable to white lead and 1 oil, and it was suggested that it could be obtained in gallon cans — it is not very easy to handle in barrels. So I made inquiries up in Omaha, and they said. Oh yea, they had just what I wanted, in cans for tree painting. I bought a couple of gallons of that and thought I was doing a land office busi - ness. The next year I discovered that wherever I put that on and it touched the bark it killed it. In some large cuts I placed this liquid to repaint them and in every instance the new growth was killed, so that it is a dangerous thing. I would not think of buying this asphal - tum in these gallon cans. A. I came across a few cases like that. We use our own. The solid asphaltum that they use for paving the streets and melt up our own. with linseed oil or gasoline. For wound painting I would prefer the linseed oil on account of not injuring the cambium. Rabbits will keep away. Mr. Marshall: Did you ever paint a tree with wood veneer? A. Yes, I would not put that paint on Chairman. Someone may ask if we have rabbits in town. We could answer by saying we killed seventeen when we burned one brush pile. Meeting adjourned until Wednesday afternoon. Wednesday Afternoon, January IS, 1918. Chairman calls meeting to order. Chairman: The first topic this afternoon is "The Everbearing Strawberry in 1917," by Mr. G. S. Christy, of Johnson. 'THE EVERBEARING STRAWBERRY IN 191T G. 8. Christy So many people have gotten the idea into their heads that the everbearing strawberry is something new and wonderful and the crea - tion of a wizard like our California man, Luther Burbank. but the real facts are that this was in existence when Adam was born into the world. There is nothing new under the sun, and the everbearing straw - berry is not new, but some varieties are new. They keep crossing first one variety and then the other, and these are new. That is one thing certain, and I have been keeping tabon the varieties since they began </seg>
            <seg id="p126">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 126 to produce anything that would bear fruit for use through the whole season, and have tested out nearly all the varieties until the last two or three years, but all that have been in existence any length of time I have tested. Men get the idea into their heads that if they have an everbear - ing strawberry that is all that is necessary. The only everbearing strawberry is the Progressive. The main trouble with so many of the berries is the diseases and the everbearing strawberry brought to America just as it comee from its native haunts will not stand our rust at all. Crossing has been necessary, and the Progressive is the one that stands the rust and other diseases better than any other, and is the most prolific bearer of any. The berries are not large, but there are more of them. Now as to the everbearing strawberry in 1917. This has been rather an unfavorable year in some ways. Our plants started out very nicely in the Spring and I thought we were going to have a world plant and then along about the fourth of July the weather got dry and we quit setting plants, and the plants quit bearing berries that were of value. They were small and did not fill out nice and were not worth picking. All through July and part of August, the everbear - ing strawberry was of no value to us, br.t when the rains came — I for - got now just when, but think along the middle of August — then they began bearing again, and by the first of September or the middle of September, after the State Fair, we began picking berries again, and from that on until the hard frosts that killed them, I do not think the Progressive has ever borne as many berries as it did this year. We did not try to keep them picked, and they set so many berries that it was just a treat to get out and look at those plants. Sometimes there would just be a row of red berries clear around. I know that often I would pick a few berries for a meal and three or four plants would make a little box full of berries. I never got as many berries in my life as I did this year in September. And the beauty of it is where ri can get it out into the irrigation districts and keep water on them summer, then they kept that same pace up all the year through. kBut you must not think that because you have an everbearing wberry you are going to have strawberries all the times, because e are a number of everbearers now that are nearly worthless, and are better to sell than to eat. We used to have a saloon keeper in our town that said whiskey was made to sell and not to drink, and he got quite wealthy selling it. Now there are some people that have ever - bearing strawberries to sell, and not really to produce anything worth eating. Now we must be careful not to buy just everywhere, but buy the one that will stand the diseases and keep busy and bear fruit all the </seg>

            <seg id="p129">THE EVERBEARING STRAWBERRY IN 1117 129 One of our speakers from Kansas said this morning with refer - ence to an apple that a fellow was nearly as well fed from eating an apple as from eating a potato; and I wonder how many realise that a great many of the diseases of Ttie human race can be warded off by eating certain fruit. The American Indian died off more from measles and small pox, than they did from the white man's bullets — because of the fact that they were meat eaters and not fruit eaters, and the same thing is true today. The man who is a meat eater attacked by any fever has not one chance in ten, where the man that eats fruit stands a much better chance, especially in eating the strawberry, be - cause the elements that a person would use in combating fevers are In the strawberry. The same thing is true of lemons and limes, although in South America the lemon is not sour enough to ward off fevers, and they use the limes there. So these things should be studied from every point of view, from the health standpoint especially. While the strawberry might not give as much heat as a piece of fat meat, if you eat the strawberry along with the meat you live longer than if you Just eat the meat. One thing that I admired about the everbearing strawberry it that you have the strawberry all the season through, and if they are watered or if the season is normal they will bear the entire year. But remember that a new bed must be set out every year. The Progressive strawberry bears its fruit, the continual crop all the sea - son, on the plants that are set out in the Spring. I think our old beds never do anything like the new ones. To have the everbearing straw - berry, it must be set out every Spring. Mr. Williams: Did you ever try the Fall setting? A. Yes. To put them out real early in the Fall so that they will get established would be the ideal, because that would give your plant a start in the Spring, and it would commence bearing soon, and I believe that it would continue right through, although I have never practiced that enough to really give you anything from a really prac - tical standpoint; but I think that the fact is that if your plant was planted in the Fall it would continue right on. I know that if they are planted in the Spring they do continue right on through. They never let up bearing after they start. Mr. Williams: I did not get as good results from my Fall plant - ing as I did from the Spring planting. There were not as many berries. A. I have just been questioning that. It seems to me that the Fall set berries ought to be best. Mr. Williams. I thought so. but I just tried it once, and it did not work out that way. Mr. Marshall: What dates do you mean by the Fall set berries? A. I should say about the middle of September anyhow so as to get a good start. </seg>
            <seg id="p130">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 130 FMr. Marshall: If you were selling plants in the year of 1917. Id you care to go into your patch from which you expected to your plants for the market, and dig strawberry plants out at that time, unless you get considerable higher price for them than you would the next Spring? And would you destroy more plants that were just partly made than you would really get a good patch off of that season of the year? A. If a person is to buy of the nursery, unless you just raise them for your own planting, I would want three times as much for a thousand plants in the middle of September, anyhow, than I would the first of March. Mr. Marshall: We have had calls for them in the Fall, and going in to look them over we found that it is impractical to go into a strawberry patch and dig plants at that time of year. A. You cannot do that as a nurseryman. You have to simply buy from a person that has a small bed and will take up the plants that have started and put them out, but to go to a nursery and buy them, unless you realise what it means to a field of berries to dig them up rn the plants are just starting, why you will never pay what they really worth. tMr. Williams: I have taken out plants from my beds set early in Spring — plants that set their runners early and were well rooted. q go in there with a knife or trowel and dig out individual plants without disturbing but few runners. But I simply charge two prices. I won't begin to dig until they are strong enough to spare them, but I don't try to wholesale — it is only in a retail way. I would not go in and dig up the roots for four times the price. But I charge two prices in a retail way and make it very profitable for filling the Fall trade. A. In that way it is a very small process, but it is worth twice as much anyhow. I would have the people to get it into their minds especially that just an everbearing strawberry does not amount to much, and that there Is as much difference in a Progressive and some of the other everbearing strawberries as there is between the very finest thorough - bred cattle and the very lowest Texas rangers that you can think of. So get the best while you are getting it. The Progressive is the only one that I would advise the general farmers to buy. Mr. Marshall. Just to bring out that point a little more thoroughly about the Fall planting. Any nurseryman that is in the business gets called right along for delivery of strawberry plants in the Fall; and unless it is just in a local way, would you recommend that people secure plants in the Fall and have them shipped and re-planted, rather in me spring . </seg>
            <seg id="p131">THE EVER-BEARING STRAWBERRY IN 1»17 131 A. No. Because there are so many things that enter into the Fall planting: that the plant set in the Fall is more liable to be win - ter-killed and injured, and when you have a dry Fall they will not get started. It seems as though nature stores that crown full of vitality In the Fall ready for Spring starting, and if you planted out in the rail, then you could not get them prepared to get that start so that the crown hasn't that vitality stored up in it that it will have in the Spring. Just the last few weeks in the Fall is when the strawberry plants gets ready for the life through the winter and to go into that dormant state that is necessary for them to start out again in the Spring. Every one of you farmers know that it does not make any difference whether a cockleburr is three inches high or three feet high, in the Pall they are going to set a cockleburr. A strawberry plant, whenever the win - ter begins to come on, seems- to store that nutriment that is necessary for them to go into that dormant state and lay there through the winter. I suppose some of our animals must be a little bit tbe tame way, hibernate and come out in the Spring, and they get prepared for it in the Fall. I advise planting strawberries in the Spring rather than in the Fall. Mr. Brown: Tell us the difference between the Superb and the Progressive. There seems to be a conclusion in this Society. A. The Superb is a little the largest berry. I don't know Just what the cross was for the Superb. The cross for the Progressive was the European berry and the Senator Dunlap. The Superb never seems to set very many berries the first year. There will be one or two or three straggling berries along all the time, and they are larger and a little better, but still the Progressive is just about as good as any of them; and another nice thing about the Progressive is that you don't need to pick them often. If they are picked twice a week you will not lose any berries. The Superb will bear more berries the second year for the old planting all through the season than it does the first year, but the Progressive bears the first crop. Not over half of my Superbs, I think, bore a single berry last year, although some of them had quite a few berries on, but none of them were loaded like the Pro - gressives. Mr. Brown. There was one thing that I wanted to say. There is a nursery man in the West here that is putting out, in my judgment, the Superb for the Progressive, and doing it honestly. My understanding of the two varieties is that a Superb is the larger berry, grows on a shorter stem, the berry lays right on the ground, the folfage is considerably heavier, and it is a very slow in - creaser; that is, it does not produce the runners for the plants that the Progressive does. The Progressive bears the characteristics of its parent, Dunlap, in the rapid production of plants, and it has a quality very much like the Dunlap. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 A. Also, the Progressive berry is red nearly all the way through tMr. Brown: There is one point about the everbearing strawberry: are everbearing simply because they bear the crop on the cur - year's growth of plant. That is, the plant that is made this year i fruit this year — in the latter part of the season they are where you get the best results. A. It has been my good luck quite often to see a ripe berry on a runner that had started out and on account of the dry weather had failed to take root, but later on the new root has blossomed and ripened a berry and drawn its strength all from the mother plant so that they bear their fruit about as soon as ever they are set. The roots start down and the blossoms start up. Question: I might say our experience with Superb this year proved equally successful as the Progressive. We installed an irriga - tion plant and tested out this year on strawberry plants. Of course we had some very severe hot weather during July and August, but our Superbs were two years old and a part of the Progressive were two years old and the rest were yearlings; and while the Superb berry of course was larger they were not quite so prolific, but we had berries a longer period of time from the Superb than we had from the Progressive. The Progressive quite bearing, I don't know why it was. The berry would start and about the time it was the size of the fi of your little finger it would get ripe or go back on us. It was stty dry, and maybe we didn't understand how to irrigate them. We ed cutting them and digging between the rows. A. It took the people in Colorado about fifty years to find out how to irrigate. Mr. Marshall: I might say that we tried one small patch, on city lots, with the Skinner overhead system irrigation this year and we had no trouble in keeping them bearing all summer long until they froze up, and the berries were good size. They bore continuously from the fcthey started in the Spring until the freeze came in the Fall. They all Progressives. A. The Progressive is large enough. Whenever the berry is under a favorable condition, it is large enough for any reasonable pur - pose. Mr. Dwyer: I have not any of the everbearing — I am sticking to the Dunlap. KMr. Williams: I would like to see this irrigation project discussed little. In relation to the strawberry of course. I would like to hear &gt;out this irrigation system. Chairman: I believe in our next talk Mr. Hood will talk of that in connection with the onion growing, and I dare say it would be quite as appropriate to follow the vegetable garden talk. Our next topic is "Onion Culture in Nebraska," by G. W. Hood. </seg>
            <seg id="p133">133 "ONION CULTURE IN NEBRASKA" &lt;i. \V. Hood The Secretary, in asking me to talk to the Society, suggested that I give a brief paper on the growing of onions, and what I have to say bears more or less on the general culture and different phases of onion growing, and then I want to bring in just a little in regard to the discussion of growing onions under irrigation. The object of this brief paper is not M much to give specific de - tailed facts concerning the growing of onions, but only to give a gen - eral account of the industry and to present to you a few records that have been taken at the College, and attempt to analyze them, in order to determine whether or not in your opinion this important crop should not receive more attention from the Horticulturists of the State. In presenting this work I have in mind one particular phase of onion culture, that is the method which will produce the greatest yield and give the greatest number of special or fancy grade bulbs for the market. However, to grow onions profitably, the preference of the market in which they are to be sold should be consulted, before venturing on this industry, because the market is as important as the soil. We know that onions of certain form or color can be sold more readily and at better prices than those varieties with which your market is not familiar. The market in this section of the country will consume a larger amount of the red and yellow globe onions, and there is usually steady demand for the white skins which is not filled. The white skinned onions bring a higher price, although as a rule the other types are more profitable. Varieties. The onion is divided into the American and Foreign types, and these types again sub-divided according to shape and color. The shapes range from a flat, compressed bulb, to the round, globe shaped bulb; and the color ranges through reds and yellows and white. In selecting a variety, you must bear in mind that the flat shaped onions are the earliest and the surest in ripening and this type of onion should be selected for an extra early crop. The round or globe shaped onions usually attain a larger size, and yield a heavier crop to a given area, but require a longer season and should not be planted on light, dry soils, or they will ripen prematurely. Phases of Onion Growing Onion growing is divided into three phases, namely, the growing of small green onions for early spring trade, second, the growing of </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY large mature bulbs, and third, the growing of small undeveloped bulbs called sets. It Is a question as to which phase is the most profitable, but the mature bulbs are of the greatest importance from a commer - cial standpoint. There are two ways of producing the -small green onions. The common method is to plant onion sets, which are undeveloped bulbs, early in the spring and to harvest the green onions as soon as they attain the proper size. This method produces the quickest results, but the product is somewhat strong. The second method is to plant the seed and harvest the onions as soon as they have grown large enough. This method produces the finest quality, but requires time and often the price is lower. tThe growing of mature bulbs is done in three ways: First, the ting of the seed as early in the spring as the ground can be worked, as soon as the onions are large enough, practice thinning, so that they are properly placed. This method is perhaps the most important from a commercial standpoint, and the one commonly followed, particu - larly for the production of the American sets. The second method is the planting of the small sets, and allow - ing these to develop into the large onion. This method is not exten - sively employed in a commercial way because of the cost of the sets, and also because too large a percentage of the bulbs form a seed stalk and produce a thick neck, which not only injures them in the market, but prevents them from curing and keeping well. Practically all of our varieties will lend themselves to either of these two methods, Cthe variety selected will be determined by the grower and the ket. This, however, is not true of the next method, which is the pro - duction of large bulbs from transplanted seedlings. Where the proper varieties are selected, and good care and attention is paid to the crop, it seems to me that this method has the greatest possibilities for large yields and good prices than any other way of growing onions. Irriga - tion with this method, not only greatly increases the yield, but adds materially to the quality and the size of the product. To practice this method, the first important step is to select the proper variety and one that will stand transplanting, and by that I mean, a variety which can be transplanted with a certainty that from 95 to 98% will grow. I think that It Is the consensus of opinion that the Prizetaker is the most valuable variety for transplanting. This variety not only trans - plants well, but develops a large, mild bulb, which brings a fancy price on the market and is practically the substitute for the Bermuda and sold under that name in numerous sections. To determine the yield and quality which might be realized from this variety, I have grown a small quantity for the past three years, and compared the Prizetaker with other varieties grown under the same conditions. I found from several tests that practically all of our </seg>

            <seg id="p136"/>
            <seg id="p137">137 ONION CULTURE IN NEBRASKA common varieties did very poorly when transplanted, and in fact from 2 0 to 60% would die and never take hold after transplanting. This large mortality could no doubt be lessened if water in some form could be applied as soon as the seedlings were set out. The Prize - taker in every case, transplanted with better success and gave more first class bulbs and higher yields. However, where water was avail - able, it did not pay to transplant many of these varieties, because the bulbs would not get enough larger or produce a sufficiently large in - crease to warrant the extra expense of growing and transplanting. To grow onions by this method, the seed is planted in a hotbed about the middle of February. The seed is sown thickly in rows 2% or 3 inches apart. When the plants have grown to a height of about 3 or four inches, the tops should be clipped off to about 2 inches from the ground. This clipping process should be practiced two or three times whenever the tops begin to fall over. The clipping of the tops has two important effects; flirst it prevents the tops from falling over and matting together, which shuts out air and sun, and gives condi - tions conducive to disease and second, it develops a large root system. The last clipping should be given when the plants are set into the field, and at this time the roots should also be pruned. This double prun - ing aids greatly in transplanting. The transplanting to the field is usually done about the first of May, and where any quantity is being set, the quickest method is to first prepare the ground thoroughly, and then mark off the rows about 12 to 14 inches apart. This can be done by making a marker which will mark off 12 or 14 rows at a time and is drawn by a horse. The transplanting can be done the quickest by having three crews of workers, one set to remove the plants from the hotbed and trim the roots and tops, the second set to carry the plants to the field and distribute them along the row, and the third set to transplant the seedlings. The seedlings are set about 3 inches in the row and it requires about 175,000 plants to set an acre. The cost of planting onions in this way is high and varies with the locality and to the different prices which must be paid for labor; how - ever, this first cost is offset because you have no thinning to do and very, little hand weeding, so that the labor cost is equalized. The cost for setting an acre ranges from $50 to $100, depending upon the dif - ferent varying factors. The yield and returns are variable and can be materially increased by the use of some form of irrigation. For this section, the Skinner system of overhead irrigation seems to be the most satisfactory, and the water should be supplied as soon as the plants are set and the soil thoroughly soaked. This aids greatly in producing a full stand. The subsequent irrigation will depend upon the weather, but sufficient water should be supplied to keep the plants growing rapidly and steadily, until the late summer, when the water should be withheld. </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY I The Prizetaker onion grown in this manner, produced 2,764 lbs. 2,040 feet of rows, or 1.3 pounds to every linear foot. Figured on i basis of an acre, the yield would be in the neighborhood of 50,000 pounds to the acre. The Australian Brown, produced only 1,207 pounds to 1,920 feet of rows, or .6 of a pound per linear foot, or less than one-half as many as the Prizetaker. In addition to producing a smaller yield, the Aus - tralian Brown will not bring as high a price as the Prizetaker, and in my opinion it is not profitable to grow these onions by this method. Summing up the onion industry, I believe it is a conservative state - ment to say that growing the Prizetaker by this method with irrigation, K graded and packed into a No. 1 pack, that the profits from an acre range from $500 to $1,000. Discussion Mr. Williams: Would you advise that Prizetaker as a long keeper? Mr. Hood: It is keeping so far, up to date. I would not say that it is a long keeper. It is keeping remarkably well this year and we have quite a few now that are in good shape and I believe they are good yet for thirty days at any rate. I don't believe that it would pay to grow these onions unless they were grown and packed In a special package, probably containing twenty to say twenty-five pounds, and sold the same way as Bermudas. I think that then it is decidedly a profitable crop. Relative to the method of farm irrigation, I might say that for this soil the Skinner system is to be preferred. We tried it by flooding and by running it down the furrows and we find that the soil packs and becomes hard; but with the Skinner system it seems to be more natural, the water falls in very fine mist and really is the same as rain. Mr. Christy: Was that (indicating a Prizetaker onion) grown from the seed this year? , A. That was grown from a seed, and rather a small seed planted about the first of March. They were allowed to grow there and then were clipped off several times which merely made them stalkier, and then they were set in the field about four inches apart, a little further than necessary, and the seedlings were not graded. Now if you have a sufficient number it pays to sort out the better seedlings, because you get a more uniform product. By grading your seedlings before you plant them you get a little more uniform stand, but these sold entirely by the pound for sweet onions and they are very mild to eat when cooked. Mr. Titus: Could not you plant that before May 1st? A. Yes, you could plant them earlier. </seg>
            <seg id="p139">139 Mr. Williams: Are not they hardy enough to stand transplanting in April? tA. Yea, perhaps, but I question whether you gain much by it, use so long aa they are growing in the hot beds they have better itions to grow than outside. This is an idea I have in my own mind and which I want to try, in (act I did not think about it until too late this Fall: I believe that the seed of those onions can be planted in August in an outdoor seed bed and allowed to grow up until cold weather comes on and then covered up. I believe they would winter up and then be transplanted in the Spring the same as out of a hot bed. That way you gain a good deal by not having the expense of hot beds. That is done further South. Mr. Dwyer: We tried it once, and it worked all right. Question: Would you advise going into onion raising extensively unless you had the arrangements made to irrigate? A. I believe it would pay. I think you would get between three or four hundred bushels a normal year, which would probably net $100 an acre, but to make any larger yields I think it would probably pay to have some form of irrigation, and I suggest the overhead. Now it seems rather large probably, but this space we used was one hundred seventy Teet long by fourteen feet wide and we sold about $1,700 worth to the acre. While the cost of production would be quite large, the whole thing would probably cost about $300 to produce, yet I believe it is more profitable to grow the onions by this method and pay a higher cost of production than to go on a larger scale and make leaa. You are catering to a fancy trade and competing with the Southern grown onions and thus get better prices. We sold most of these for five cents a pound and some for four cents. There would be a good demand for them at that price, and there is a good market further north, up in Minneapolis and other cities. It is an entirely specialized market and you are competing with an onion that brings high prices, and I think you have equally as good a quality. In fact I sold some right here in town right along with the Bermudas. Question: How about the price for seedlings? A. You could not expect any more for the ordinary seedlings than you could the market onion. Possibly a good conservative esti - mate is around $1.25 a bushel. Question: How about the Mountain Danver? A. I don't think it is so good for transplanting. I have tried it for the past three years. The tests are not very promising. A certain percentage will grow, but it costs quite largely and unless you get a good stand the yield is cut down, and then too the size does not war - rant your transplanting them. You get just about as large a bulb by sowing the seed as you do by transplanting. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 140 I have not any records here, but there is quite a difference in the yield of the different varieties. The white onions, as a whole yield less than some of the yellows and reds, but in the market they really distinguish between the red and yellow and white, regardless of the variety. This year I know of a record of the Yellow Danver where they raised two hundred fifty bushels to the acre without irrigation. Mr. Williams: Does not the Globe outyield the ordinary varieties? A. I am sure I don't know. Personally I am not very much taken with that onion, and I do not know. It is grown quite largely, but it is a flat type. Mr. Williams: I mean the red Globe. A. Oh, the red Globe varieties I think will outyield the other varieties Question: Have you ever had any experience in handling any other methods of irrigation except t"he Skinner system? A: Not a great deal. I had a little experience here trying to flood, but I would not call it any experience really. In fact I have just about come to the conclusion with what I have seen, that this type of soil that we have around here will not stand flooding. I have observed it out at the Farm, and the ground seems to pack and run together, and when you cultivate it it will break up in lumps. That condition does not seem to exist when you apply the water in the form of the Skinner system. Whether there is a difference, or when you flood the water soaks down further, I do not know. Question: Do you think the ground sours if it is irrigated too often? A. I don't know. I don't believe it would if you practice thor - ough cultivation. Question: It has been an experiment with us and we are endeavor - ing to learn all we can in regard to the matter but we found last summer in flooding that the ground baked and it was difficult to get in early .enough to stir up the soil before it got so hard that it came up in lumps, and for that reason we didn't find it very successful in handling some strawberry patches and small fruits. We did find it successful in handling trees, the compass plum and a few cherries. A. That is about the same experience that we have had. I imagine that it injures the physical condition of the soil. It does more damage possibly than the water does good, and you have probably ob - served that those lumps are almost impossible to break up after a year or two. I don't think that condition would exist in more sandy soil. In Michigan you could run the water right down between the rows, where the soil was sandy; but we have alkali soil here and heavy fine soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p141">INSECT PESTS IN THE VEGETABLE GARDEN 141 INSECT I'KSTS IN THE VEGETABLE GARDEN' Professor L. Bruner Mr. President, and Members of the Horticulture Society: tl have not gone to the trouble to prepare a speech for today, be - ; I have spoken so often to the Horticultural Society that what- I say, even if I prepared it, I suppose I have said before. I notice that the program says that I was to introduce the sub - ject of insect pests on garden crops. Now it would be a very queer thing if we had plants of any kind that were not attacked by insects, and of course when we are cultivating plants that we call vegetables why we take it for granted that there are insects that are interested in the vegetables, whether they are cultivated or not. A great many of our vegetables belong to the same group of plants that a great many Sour garden weeds belong to, and so we have the very common thing the insects that attack the weeds transferring their attention to a great many of the vegetables that grow In the garden; so we have at once a suggestion there that if we keep our weeds down thoroughly there is less danger of these insects to our vegetables, and especially those that are related to the garden plants. Now it is impossible for me to tell you definitely how many insects there are that attack garden vegetables, or plants that are classified as vegetables, but there are a great many of them, and we are liable to have some of these present every year in the State of Ne - braska, or in any other localities where vegetables are grown. It would be impossible for me to describe all of these, or to tell you very much about all of them, or of a great many of them. It seems to me that anybody who is going into the growing of vegetables, say a market gardener or anyone who is growing a big vegetable garden for his own use, ought to get a treatise on the insect enemies of the vegetables. There have been a great many papers published from time to time on certain kinds of insects that effect some particular plants in the garden. I shall not show my slides as I talk exactly, but we will take up the slides and then say some few words about some of them as we go along. If you want to get any work on garden insects, you could get various bulletins that are published by the United States Department of Agriculture, contributed as farmers' bulletins, or as bulletins from the Bureau of Entomology, that treat with some kinds of these insects, as I said attacking some particular group of garden plants or plants that are grown in the garden. The only one book that I know of where all of these insects are brought together in one work Is a lit - tle book entitled, "Insects Injurious to Vegetables," and this was written by the same party who has written these bulletins that were </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY contributed from Washington. They are condensed to form a book. The price is somewhere from $1.00 to $1.25. It is published by Orins Judd Company. They usually sell their books at reasonable prices. I will speak of the insects such as cut worms. There are a num - ber of different kinds of cut worms. Everybody who has grown gar - den knows that, and knows certain methods of fighting them. There are other kinds of caterpillars, such as garden web worms, and the hairy caterpillars that we find working on weeds; some streaked and etriped and banded and other kinds that have tufts of hair on their bodies. Altogether of the insects belonging to that group known as the butterflies and moths we have perhaps fifty to seventy species at - tacking vegetables. Only a dozen or so of those are really injurious. Then we have a number of leaf beetles, beetles that belong to the same family with the potato beetles, the cucumber beetles and the bean beetles. There are quite a number of them that are found attacking our garden plants. The flea beetles — there are a number of different kinds of those. Some of them like one kind of vegetable better than any other kind, and some of them are green feeders. We have many kinds of beetles. There are beetles that vary in size from one-twelfth of an inch to those that are a quarter of an inch in length, and these are called flea beetles because they jump. Some of them are very injurious and especially in the Spring of the year, and most of these beetles by the way are enemies of weeds and they transfer their attention from the weeds to the cultivated plants. There are some of the blister beetles, or oil beetles, that attack different ones of our vegetables, especially potatoes and beans and peas, because these beetles attack the representatives of those same plants as weeds and they transfer their attention to the cultivated plants. Grasshoppers and related insects — there are a number of them that work in the garden. I remember when I was a boy and we read of the migratory grasshopper, locusts, and that onions especially were sought after by these creatures, and if you would meet a swarm of them out on the prairies you could smell their breath. They even go down in and eat out the onion in the ground, and leave perhaps the outside thin skin. That clogs their teeth I suppose, but the ball they eat all right. There are various kinds of winter grtibs or June bugs. Then we have wire worms; we have different kinds of plant lice; different kinds of plant bugs; different kinds of leaf hoppers; and then we have lit - tle insects that are known as thrifts; and we have a spider or a mite known as the red spider. All of these work on the different vege - tables indiscriminately. They work back and forth. Other special kinds are asparagus beetles, the bean and pea weevil, bean ladybug, the squash vine ladybug and the bean leaf beetle, the bean leaf roller. and various kinds of cabbage insects but all of these cabbage insects work on the turnip too, and the grape, mustard, pepper grass and </seg>

I suppose you are interested in fighting cut worms. In a small garden it is not much of a trick to keep the cut-worms down fairly well. You can plant out a dozen or two or three dozen cabbage plants. or fewer, and perhaps you notice that one or two of these ha* been nibbled off during the night, but you can go to where this plant has been eaten and dig around in the dirt a little and you will find your cutworm. You can crush him, and that is the end of that particular cutworm. Some of them get lazy once in a while, and if you lay a chip or a piece of board on the ground they will lay under there, and you turn over the board, and there you have a good many cutworms, and perhaps that is all there are in the garden at the time. You can use poison in your garden. Cutworms all like clover — every last one of them. Whether it is a cabbage cutworm or whether it is an alfalfa cutworm they will eat white clover. You can sprinkle it with solution of water and Paris Green and put the clover out in little lumps around in your garden and the cutworms are attracted to it rather than to the cabbage plants. They eat a little of that, and in the morning you see a lot of carcasses of the cutworms lying around; or you can mix Paris Green with bran and a little syrup or some - thing of that kind to make the poison stick, and sow that around in the field. The cutworms eat that poison bran. It has the same effect that the poison would on the clover. You can use the same method, use poison baits, for grass hoppers, and to some extent for wire worms, but the latter hardly ever come to the surface of the ground. They don't bother very much except In sod ground. Your white grubs are found in that same kind of ground. Now the plant lice. The cabbage louse and the pea louse and the bean louse, and a number of the other different species that attack our garden crops, can be fairly well managed by spraying. We used to think that kerosene emulsion was about the only thing that we could kill plant lice with, but there is a plant that grows that furnishes a better remedy for plant lice than kerosene does. That plant is tobacco, and it is quite much-sought-for by human being at times, but they don't use it in exactly the same way that they do for destroying plant lice. The human being takes it partly internally; the plant lice re - ceive it externally. With the Kentucky tobacco you can make what they call Black Leaf Forty, a liquid that is about 40% nicotine. You can take one part of that Black Leaf Forty and dilute it with from seven hundred fifty to fifteen hundred parts of water, and spray those plant lice and kill them. You can even kill the eggs of plant lice by using this, and it is a very, very effective remedy for plant lice of vari - ous kinds. The only thing is to get it on the ground that is covered by plant lice. The melon lice work on the under side of the leaves and you have to spray with some kind of a contrivance that will get your </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY tobacco spray on the under side, so that it touches the lice. That is sufficient. It also kills red spiders, which is a mite that works on plants occasionally. It will not kill beetles or those creatures that eat the plants, but it will kill those that suck the juice of the plants The different kinds of cucumber beetles are hard to fight because it takes a stronger preparation to kill them than it does to kill the soft - bodied insects like the plant lice. A beetle usually requires a suf - ficiently strong poison solution to destroy the plant before it does the insect, so it makes it difficult to kill them in that way, so we have to find some other method of getting them, and hurry up your plants in the Spring of the year. Plant them early, and transplant them, and get them started before the beetles come around, and then the plants take care of themselves up to a certain time when the beetles lay their eggs on the plant — then there is liable to be trouble, but when the plants ar little is when they are destroyed the most, and then you can make a little tent of some kind — use mosquito netting, and keep the beetles off, and thus you can protect them to a certain extent. You can protect them by sprinkling your plants with lime or spraying them with London Purple or Paris Green. Paris Green is preferable. The arsenic of lead may be used, and does not burn the foliage so much as Paris Green. Use one pound to ten gallons of water. Clean cultivation is not a complete remedy. It is a preventive of the attack of a great many of these insects upon our garden truck. In foreign countries they don't have very much trouble from the insect pests, at least we don't read very much of the German and French and English, and those people that cultivate their ground pretty thor - oughly, having trouble with insect pests. They get off of the ground about all that is possible to get off of it. I was in Japan a few years ago and I learned that there was one district in that country where a square mile fed over twelve hundred people year in and year out, and they still had something to sell. Now that was intensive cultivation We don't have intensive cultivation here. I don't know any place in Japan where they were not growing three or four crops on the same ground, and on some ground they would grow at least eight or ten crops in the same length of growing season that we have here, and a lot of it, and it was all handled by hand labor of course; and there was not a weed that did not furnish food for human beings that was allowed to grow in the garden or anywhere near it; and for that rea - son, I Buppose, the insects were not very numerous. I was surprised in seeing in China boatload after boatload of radishes coming into the market. They know in that country that they can grow a radish three or four inches in diameter and a foot and a half or fhree feet long, and so they usually have the large diameters, plus the extreme length of the varieties that they use, and in that way they get the immense quantities of food. I tried to collect insects in China, but there were not many to collect. There wasn't anything for them to work on except </seg>
            <seg id="p147">147 bamboo and the cultivated plants, and the bamboo insects did not at - tack any of the cultivated plants. If we get into the habit of thorough cultivation, keeping thing* clean, I don't believe that we will have the trouble that we are having now from insect attacks. I brought down about forty slides of some of these insects and I think I will just show you what some of them are. Shows slides. Mr. Williams: Our gardeners had the most difficulty in combat - ing the cabbage worm. I have never heard yet of any remedy that has been tried that is thoroughly successful. A. I don't believe they have any that are thoroughly successful, because the eggs are not laid all at the same time and there are from two to three generations of caterpillars each year. Then the poisons used to combat them may be washed off and in that way the insect is allowed to work on and get into the head and work inside. Mr. Williams. Do you think that by continued spraying in the early part of the season that you would head off the spread? You would not dare to spray late. A. You can spray up to about the time that the head is half formed. Mr. Williams: The spray runs off so badly — the liquid spray Mr. Hood: We had very good success this last year in using arsenic of lead, and we sprayed up to within ten days of harvesting, and 1 paid particular attention to watch the growth of the cabbage, and I found that the leaves fold out, or bend out, and that the inside part of the cabbage is not covered with the spray at all, and within a week before you market, if you stop you will have no trouble with them. We sprayed once every ten days and gave the late cabbages about four or five sprays and had excellent success. We used soap sticks. We put about four pounds of arsenic of lead to fifty gallons of water and used the soap — ivory soap — boiled up a little piece of it and mixed with the arsenic of lead. Mr. Williams. That caused it to stick to the leaves? Mr. Hood: Yes, it did. I used the Skinner system and sprayed right over that and cleaned the cabbage worms out. I have been trying some new powder spray and it seemed to be all right for a time, and then the bugs seemed to get the best of it and we could not do anything with it. The arsenic of lead and the soap in spray form seem to be the thing. We used about a quarter of a cake of soap to, possibly, ten gallons of spray — boil up the soap till it was thoroughly dissolved and then pour it in. I had a five gallon sprayer. Mr. Williams: It is difficult to get the right kind of spray. Professor Bruner: One cake of soap will answer about the same as four or five gallons of the expensive oil. </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY HOME VEGETAIILE GARDENS — WHAT SHOULD BE GROWN AND WHY Leo F. McShane Mr. President and Members of the Horticulture Society Your Secretary has asked me to talk to you on "Home Vegetable Gardens — What Should Be Grown and Why." This topic has been discussed at many of your meetings, so I feel like the farmer boy and his girl. This boy had his girl out buggy riding and while riding through town, passed by a popcorn stand. The girl said "m-m that smells good;" to which the farmer boy re - plied. "You like it? Well, I'll just drive up a little closer." This §bject has been talked of before, and quite a number of articles have en written in papers before, and I am going to try today to come a tie closer to the real problem. You desire to know about a "worth while" vegetable garden so, from my limited experience, my aim in this talk shall be to get close to the real problem; analyze it, so you may know the factors, and under - stand the fundamentals of vegetable gardening under condition* at tBy the exercise of care and forethought in planning the succes - of crops and rotations, and by the utilization of every foot of i, it is possible for you to grow considerable quantities of vege - tables on a limited area and so supplement the family food supply. This is not so much for the farm, but it is for the backyard and the \acant lot; although the same fundamentals apply on the farm, al - though that in the city is more intensive. Family Foot] Supply Do you realize that during these war times, you can perform no greater duty to your country than by becoming a producer of "food stuffs?" A home vegetable garden will produce fresh food for your table during the spring, summer, and fall months, and produce enough for canning, drying and storing, so your table will not lack vegetables during the long winter months. Do you realize what Government control of transportation means in regard to food? No doubt all of us have experienced this in the case of sugar, etc. If war continues, as we have every assurance it will, what about food stuffs in general? The same thing is likely to hap - pen with the other foods and if it does the vegetable garden is going to be our resource, and if we put it in now we will have those vege - tables. A Home Vegetable Garden then is a wise economy. Really fresh vegetables cannot be bought — by this I mean that there are certain vegetables that must be used as soon after harvesting </seg>
            <seg id="p149">HOME VEGETABLE GARDENS 149 as possible. If freshness and quality are desired, a home garden is indispensable. Vegetable Gardening Profitable Enterprise Now another factor. Is a garden a profitable enterprise? I have two statements here that I can back up, because I have been right around with the boys and girls in their gardens. Then I have been to homes last year where the business man put in these gardens last spring. Records show that Home Gardens are very remunerative, and if the healthful benefits are added they become extremely essential. Last year the boys and girls alone in your great state put in 5,000 gardens, gardened 61 acres in 46 towns, and their profits were in the neigh - borhooa of $27,000.00. The average profit of those who finished their project was $6.75, so that has paid more than any farm crop that you could put in. Of course it is on a small scale. I have here a letter from a man who is a cigar maker in Fremont, and who last spring needed to be out for his health, so he kept a garden all summer, and made a profit of $123.00 off of a lot 75 feet by 138. I also hare a plan of his garden and how he would plant it if he was going to plant it this year. I have no figures that I can rely on from the older peo - ple besides this one, but many more last year were putting in gardens than ever before. I was in the different towns and saw the men out working in their gardens and what they produced, and it is a matter of record which I wish we all had — that there is a crying need for more home gardens. This year every effort should be made to double the acreage and increase production; not only so you will be safe but so that we can let the other materials, wheat, meat, etc., go over to our soldiers. Kssentials of Gardening The primary needs for a successful garden on a small scale are the same as those on a large scale, though a small garden should be more intensive. Location or Site In the Home Garden, one usually has little choice of location or site for the vegetable garden. Sunlight is essential. The effect which sunshine produces in a garden assures germination and plant develop - ment. No amount of fertilizer, cultivation, etc., can offset the effects of sunshine. A good idea is to know how many hours of the day the garden is in a shadow or partial shadow, and what shade may be ex - pected from trees, etc. There is a factor that put many boys and girls on the rocks last year. They made their gardens under a tree and when the leaves came out their gardening was at an end. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Soil Soil, it has been said, is what you make it. Here again the home gardener has but little choice. The soil should be of good text - ure and contain suitable plant food. Water is essential in the soil, if plants are to make the best use of available plant food. If tree* are near at hand, the fibrous roots which ramify the soil will be a serious drawback to the garden during the hot period of the summer. When summer comes if those roots are not taken out you are going to see the effect right there. I remember in Fullerton, Nebraska, of seeing some sweet corn and a row of maple trees along the side, and you could see the sweet corn about so high when close to the trees and a Cdeal higher when away from them. The trees had taken the ure out from below. Fertilizer I It has been said and truly said, "We cannot fertilize our gardens much." This no wise gardener will doubt. But what kind, when how, are questions concerning fertilizer that must be answered. Well rotted or soil like manure is the best on hand. A garden fer - tilized in the fall before plowing is better than a garden fertilized in the spring, for the reason that, the fertilizer will have time to become a part of the soil and the plant food it contains will become more available. Vegetables, true to type and the best quality, must never receive a setback or be checked in any way. A location or garden site that has good drainage, good exposure, (that is, plenty of sunshine), soil of good texture and containing an abundance of plant food and water will assure the best development of vegetables. We cannot emphasize too much that the vegetables must be kept growing right along. The farmers that keep the vegetables growing right on top of a manure pile, as it is said, have the best vegetables. Garden Plan I The most essential fundamental of vegetable gardening is the den plan. Would a man be thought wise in these days, if he ught of building a house or building and did not previously make out a detailed plan of the proposed structure? Such a plan accom - panied with specifications is just as essential, for the proposed vege - table garden. folks are a little like the poor benighted Hindoo. You have heard about him. </seg>

            <seg id="p153">HOME VEGETABLE GARDENS 153 t The poor benighted Hindoo, Who does the best he kin do. He sticks to his caste From first to last And for pants he makes his skin do. A garden plan is an economy of time, money and effort. Garden - ing is a race against time and often against unfavorable conditions. A garden plan will answer the question, "Are you ready?" People who do not make plans rely on "common sense experience." I believe a plan to be a better application of common sense and found by experi - ence to be indispensable. A garden plan can be made out best during the month of Jan - uary. All thought of last year's garden is not at this time or year altogether gone, but if one waits till the first spring days, such is likely to be the case. Catalogues are available at this time, and last but not least, seeds ordered in January or early in February will be filled from fresh stocks. This year because of the seed shortage "the early bird is going to get the worm." I was talking with Mr. Stewart and also the Lincoln men about the seed situation and they all say, "Get in early." Our stocks were depleted last year. They say to get your plans made and get all your seeds in. I know some of the boys and girls that wanted the secoud crop of beans. They decided they wanted them in July, and there were no seeds to get anywhere. Any change in the plan can be made during the spring up to planting time with little trouble. Proper successions, rotations, companion crops, require study and much thought. If planning is left until March or April, time is a limiting factor, and as is usually the case, not much thought will be put on these essentials of gardening. Crops for canning and drying and crops for storing can best be worked out at this time. If labor is to be a factor, as it usually is, crops can be arranged so as to lessen the amount of labor. The steps necessary for reliable garden plan are as follows: 1. Get accurate dimensions of the garden. 2. Select the vegetables desired, whether for home, market, etc, depend on individual tastes. Get what you want for your own table and find out what the neighbors would buy the best, and then ar - range your garden. 3. Decide on the amount of vegetables needed. I know lots of people grew bushels and bushels of lettuce where the ground should have been used for beets or something else. 4. Select variety desired of each vegetable, rely on the old time tried favorites, be dubious of novelties. Certain carrots and peas that have always been good, that is the variety to have. Don't jump at novelties. Let the Experiment Stations experiment, but don't do that yourself. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY t5. Secure a piece of heavy wrapping paper, a ruler, and with a t pencil lay out the garden according to scale. A fairly large may be found best, so that notes "too much or too little" etc., can be added from time to time during the growing season, thus the plan becomes a record for the next season. 6. Arrange the various crops to scale, thus making a definite plan on paper. 17. Make up a list of seeds and plants etc. Order seeds at once. e your plants ready when the time comes for them. Now that r plan is finished, hang it up in the kitchen or have it handy so that you may "stick to it." We have told the boys and girls, "Adopt your slogan: plan your garden, and then get out and work your plan." (Then shows his charts and calendars. Thursday morning, January 17, 1918. ■ Meeting called to order with Mr. Chapin in the Chair in the absence President Howard. Chairman: The first topic this afternoon is "What the Public Demands of Dealers with Reference to the Apples — How Can the Growers Meet This Demand," by Mr. Emery, of Lincoln. rlT THE PUBLIC IIK.MAMh OF KKAI.KIts WITH REFERUM K THE APPLES — HOW CAN GROWERS MEET THIS DEMAND" Mr. Emery, Lincoln I am a little bit like the fellow who went out to see his girl. He was a little backward and did not have very much to say. He wore a rose in his coat, and after he had sat there quite a while, the girl kept talking to him, and finally she picked up the rose and said, ''John, I will give you a kiss for that rose." He gave her the rose and took the kiss and then they sat there again. Finally he picked up his hat and started out and she asked him where he was going, and he said, "I am going down to get another rose." That is the way with me. I am a retail groceryman, but it is you people who grow apples and things of that kind that we sell every day, and the people come to us and ask us for. I am going to try to tell you what they ex - pect of us. Let me say first that everything rests with you people who </seg>
            <seg id="p155">WHAT THE PUBLIC DEMANDS 155 grow the apples and things of that kind. It does not rest wlth r the retailers. We are simply a go-between. We can't help what comes in. If you people here are going to give us good stuff we are going to reach a higher level with our people — the people with whom we come in contact; and it seems to me that finally everything rests with you - people. . There are certain fundamentals in business that everybody has to observe. It doesn't make any difference whether you are an apple grower or a florist, you have to abide by certain rules, and it means that you have got to exercise care even ahead of where we have to before we get to the people, and it means that you have to take care of what is given to you — your orchard is your stock in trade. Now with our stores — we don't .treat it like you do your twenty-five mere* of orchard. We don't let anybody go along and do with it what they please. We give it care and do with it what will give us the beat results. The same thing with your orchards. You can't afford to let them go and give them no attention. It is Just like laying your money down and letting people come and pick it up for you. You don't do that with your money. When you take it along those lines, you have got to spray your trees, you have got to give them the care, you have to take out the trees with tree rot, and if the tree does not bear you have to take it out and put in one that is a better bearing tree, and after a little while your orchard is going to give a yield that is going to be satisfactory. We want an apple that is a good keeper and we are going to know what we get into our stores and offer to the people, and know that they are going to be satisfied with what they have. Now aleng the lines of grading. You should grade them up and sort them out, put your color on, take out any that there is any donbt about and put it aside and make cider out of it, or apple butter or can it, so that you won't have any waste with your apples. Then you will give us a better product than we have been able to get before, and you are going to utilize and do away with the waste and ground rots; and I think that really that lack of grading is one of the Crimea that we have allowed and especially in Nebraska apples — the grading and the waste. I don't know how many of you are apple men, but lots of times I have driven down into the apple country and seen apples laying on the ground that never should have been there be - cause the man didn't take proper care of his orchard. He did not take advantage of what he had and the apples went to waste. Now take last summer here in Lincoln. When the time for apple cider came around I drove I believe one afternoon in the neighborhood of seventy-five or one hundred miles. I went to every farm house that I saw, no matter how small an orchard it had, and I tried to get cider and couldn't get any. And I said, "What is the matter?" They said, "We have not time to bother with it. There are too many other </seg>
            <seg id="p156">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 156 things on our mind." Only three times in the City of Lincoln were we able to get a drop of cider. We are not even able to get vinegar around here, because you people that grow your apples have not taken care of your waste, and the things that belong to you, and to nobody else. Nobody else can use that which you can. I say that it Is a crime that you let those things slip away from you, and the other fellow is getting no benefit whatever either. Now take the grading of apples. One of the biggest faults with our Nebraska apples is that you don't grade them in the right way. I was over here last night to the auditorium and looked at the show. On your tables you had a few nice apples where they were spread out three and four on a plate. Those were nice, there was no doubt about it, and the variety was good. But, I don't know who the man was that fixed up those boxes, but on the platform where I saw your boxed apples I saw little small ones from the smallest size on up, and so Irregular. It simply means that when a lady comes Into the store and sees a small apple and a big one right in the same box she is going to demand the larger apple when she gets it at the same price. You have to price it by the piece or pound, and the small one does not look good to her and she does not want it. And by not grading you dont get the prices that you ought to for your apples. The Northwest apples are graded as 86, 100, 113 and 125 apples, and you know what you have got, and your apple runs uniform and you can gauge your prices — your selling price — and the packers know what to expect, and then you have got grades that are labelled "Fancy," "Extra Fancy," or whatever you want to call them and the people know what r' have when they see it. It is uniform and makes it much easier the merchant when he gets it. If you have a few big apples that run only 80 to a box, it is bet - ter to sort them out and put them in a box by themselves and wrap and mark on the box what is there, and we have got something that we can work from. If you put it in a barrel and label it, get a standard by weight. There is more discrepancy in the weight that you people put out in your apples. If you could take your apples and put them out at so much a pound, you are going to know what you get for what you have sold. You don't need to lose on the shrinkage. Just pack them net weight, allow your tare and shrinkage and the merchant knows exactly what he has bought. Apples should be sold by the pound and not by so much a peck. That thing is obsolete. We had quite a little argument a few years ago as to what constituted a peck, and it varied all the way from forty pounds to forty-eight, and that Is too much difference in a bushel of apples, and we were at sea. Then the Pure Food Administrator came down to us and asked what was the matter and said, "You fellows over here are one price and your neighbor is another." But we said, "How are we going to know." And they did try the best that they knew how to fix a standard sixed peck so that everybody would be on a uniform basis, but it came to </seg>
            <seg id="p157">WHAT THE PUBLIC DEMANDS 157 naught, because Oregon shipped in their fruit, and they had one weight, and you Nebraska growers had another — from forty to forty - eight pounds to the bushel. What were we going to do? It meant that we had to get down and weigh that barrel and find out what was in it before we could merchandise it to the public. And it was not right. It is expensive to take your time to do it and makes waste, and when you handle the apples and repack them, we are going to bruise the apples and not give the public the fruit the way It should go to them. I don't care much whether they are barreled or boxed apples, so long as they are what the people want, but they want fruit that they are not going to have a loss in their home. You growers are not going to get the top price for your fruit when it is mixed and not graded. You will get better prices and the people will be better satisfied if they get what they are looking for. As an illustration, I have possibly six, seven or eight different varieties of Washington apples on my floors that I am not entitled to have there, but we are forced to go there for the fruit because the Nebraska product is not in the right shape to use, and we can't get it in the right shape. Three or four years ago you people put stuff in cold storage and some apple growers came around to us to show us what they were going to do, and to talk Nebraska apples to us. A big apple grower showed us two or three apples as a sample and tried to sell them. They didn't get very far because we couldn't use them Why? Because when we would open up our barrels we would find all those little things that were not graded, and not up to standard and should not have been packed in that shape or manner at all. I don't know who grew the apples, but we were not satisfied. , I say this not to criticise, but to help you and to tell you what you need. You would be surprised at the number of people who come Into tho&gt; store and buy five and ten cents' worth of apples. They want good apples. Sometimes they are satisfied to take one if it Is a nice big one. But you mix in the small stuff and you expect the retailer to grade the apples so that he can sell that merchandise. That is a thing that should not be required of him. When you ask the retailers to do that you are going to put them at an expense. The people are going to go where they can get the best for their money with the least amount of work, which necessarily cuts down their expense. You ought to go up here before your Legislature and ask them to enact laws which makes everybody who raises apples for commercial use to use a certain standard — to have a standard measure — some - thing tc go by, so that you all have the same weight. , There are few that wrap their apples. I suppose that the apples over there for the show were wrapped primarily to keep. If the policy is good lo wrap them to keep, then it is right and Just as much essential that you pack them and use just as much care when you are sell'ng them to Mr. King or Mr. Fredericks, or whoever it may be. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY They want the apples bo that they are going to get them in the best shape they can use them. Let them put the apples out and put on the end of the box who the grower is. If a man has merchandise and he puts his name on it, the grower should not be ashamed to put his name on his merchandise Any wholesale house puts their name on their packages. They brand them for what they are. Why should not an apple grower be on the same level with everybody else? He is behind the times because he has let the other fellow get ahead of him. He has not packed his merchandise in the right way. When you commence to put your mer - chandise up in the right way, the retailer can glance at it and know exactly what he has and can put confidence in it when he sees that grower's name on it — he has something to come back on. He can correct an evil. I have a carload of apples in cold storage right now and I had an apple grower in yesterday and I opened up a barrel, and showed him what I meant when I said the merchants were not getting a square deal from the Nebraska apple growers. I wrote a man a letter one time. I won't tell you who he is, but I wrote him a letter about some apples he had sent me for Number One stuff, and told him I didn't believe his stuff was right. I said, "I am not a calamity howler, but you have not given me what should be Number One Standard." He answered and said, "I have gauged it according to my Number One" — that is not what the public wants and demands. It should not be that he has one standard and you men have another standard, and we are going to get the people satisfied. The people come in and see his Number One and show the apple alongside of the other stuff, and they are not satisfied. It ought to be just as well graded as any other apple. Some other communities are grading their apples today. You need distribution. I don't care whether it is in an Associa - tion, or what your form is. You see your things one way and another man has another way. And you don't know where your stuff goes. You don't know. You turn it loose in here all together, and you have no way to distinguish what belongs to you and what belongs to the other fellow. You take any man that merchandises canned goods — he knows in a minute whether it is his stuff or the other fellow's. Why don't you people know? But you don't know. People come into the store and say, "Where did those apples come from?" And I don't know. But it has been such that we could tell the Nebraska product from the shipped-in product, because the Nebraska product has not been graded up right. The New York apple growers grade their apples and put them in barrels. Of late they have not been doing that because they have been doing like the Nebraska people have been doing. They have been letting their orchards go by the board, but they have a standard and that means something. They put in a full three bushels when gauging by the bushel instead of by the pound; </seg>

            <seg id="p161">WHAT THE PUBLIC DEMANDS 161 and they know what they are giving, and so do we. Every apple that they sent out looked uniform, and the New York product generally com - mands a better price on the Lincoln market today than does our Ne - braska product. It should not be so, but it does- — because it is graded up. You people can do those things, and make money. We are buy - ing New York cider today and selling it for ninety cents a gallon and we pay wholesale eighty cents for it, and we should not have that to do when we are growing apples as they are in Southeastern Nebraska. Question: Does not Mr. Pollard have the cider? A. He was out a long time ago. They have a new drink in Oregon made from apple juice that they are demonstrating. It is made from certain varieties of apples and they are getting |2.25 a dozen bottles. It is a fine drink, blended sweetly, and they are getting back 100%. That is efficiency that you people ought to have and have not got. It belongs to you. If you people get down to more uniform laws and grade your fruit up, the public is going to be better satisfied. Just yesterday I had to apologize to people in the store for Nebraska stuff, the way we send it out and sell it at cut prices. It is not right, men, and it is not right for you to ask us to put that kind of merchandise in our stores. I think if you people get together and find out what you want for a standard, and go up here and ask your Legislature to enact it into a law, and say that they have got to grade the stuff, and you know where your stuff goes, and you label it just exactly as is canned goods so that the purchaser knows where it came from and who grown by, then you are going to get better prices for your stuff and everybody is going to be satisfied. We send out Nebraska stuff, and they say, "I don't want that kind or stuff." It is not pleasant to come up here and tell you people that, but it won't take you long to And out why I said that to you. Ton ought to look up this matter, do it for your own benefit. Mr. Youngers: How are you going to regulate the weight? A bushel of Gano or Winesap will weight about forty pounds, and a bushel of Jeneattp will weight about fifty-two, and there are all the different varieties in between. A. That is all true too. But you take for Instance here: every Northwest apple that you get shows the net weight on the package. Mr. Marshall: That is a fictitious weight. They do that to com - ply with law. I have weighed some of them, so I know how they weigh up. Question: They all vary, but they put forty pounds on every one of them, net. A. That is all true. Can't you Nebraska fellow* do the same way? They are further along than the Nebraska people. </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Mr. Marshall: There is a stamp on the end of the barrels, which •ays volume three. bushels, and a certain number of cubic inches. You can't use anything else but a standard barrel. The standard barrel has been used in Nebraska for ten years possibly. It is exactly the same size as any New York barrel. That is as near we we can get to it. We have to use the standard package, standardized by the gov - ernment. The law gives the number of cubic inches and we have to comply with that in buying barrels, and the government sees that they put out barrels that comply with the law. A. I want to raise a question here. Suppose you put the Ben Davis apples in your barrel, so many pounds of apples will be in that barrel, but I don't know how many pounds are in there. I say my Ben Davis apples cost me $4.00 a barrel, but I don't know how many pounds were in that barrel. Now the Pure Food Administration has come to us repeatedly and asked us to sell by the pound. The Na - tional Government in their reports that they are sending out say, "Do not sell by the bushel or by the peck," and we are forbidden by law — national law — to sell you a peck of potatoes, because they say that different states vary, and they want you to sell by the pound. We are gradually eliminating the selling of anything by the peck, and now sell by the pound. If you put Genitians into a barrel and you say how many pounds there are in the barrel we know what to expect from that, but we can't tell when you simply say three bushels. We have to make things as simple in the store as possible because the average clerk does not exercise as much care with the goods as you people would because his heart is not in the work, it is not his pocketbook that is interested in the business. But if you say it is so much a pound and there are so many pounds, it makes it easier for the clerk. He knows exactly what he is going to do. You can say to a house - wife, "You are getting four pounds of apples for twenty-five cents," and she weighs them at home and knows just exactly what she has bought. But if you have fifty-two pounds of one kind of apples to a bushel and forty pounds of another and sell them by the bushel, she doesn't know what she has got. Mr. Marshall: You think then it would be policy to brand the different varieties of apples, and mark the weight? Question: You can't do that with apples because evaporation takes place. Of course you could put a wide limit on it and put in more into the barrel than it calls for. A. I happen to manufacture one article that we sell all over the United States and I have to comply with all the national laws. We mark on the package the net weight when we packed it, but we allow tare always. Question: But the fact of your selling price of apples. You can't tell what is in the barrel when you get it, because of the evaporation. </seg>
            <seg id="p163">WHAT THE PUBLIC DEMANDS 163 A. I don't know how the small towns handle that, but I know that in cold storage plants the average merchant don't want to over - load, and it is your business to see that he does not overload. There is not much shrinkage between the time he gets it and the time he sells it. And the difference you are talking about does not offset the waste that we have in our apples today and the way we hare to sell them. Mr. Barnard. From the retail merchant's view that Is an right. But I don't believe the fault is so much in the packing among these men that are growing the apples as there is in the Commission men that buy carloads and pack them themselves. More apple men are sell - ing their orchards now that way than they used to. I never had as big a snap in my life as I had this year. I sold my orchard on the tree. All those apples went somewhere. The man that bought that stuff from me saw to the selling of the apples. Somebody is going to pay for them, but if they are not right it is not our fault- We sell them on the tree. I know a good many of these apple growers and I have known some of them for a good many years and I don't believe that they will put something into the barrel that had not ought to be there, and most of us sell our apples in barrels. When I pack my own I am not afraid to say that Barnard packed them, but time and again I have sold those apples to men who were going to retail them and they did not want them labelled, because a customer would come along and see my name on the barrel and would write down to me and want to buy them direct. Lots of the retailers do not want names on the barrels. But when you get to your Western stuff they are out of our jurisdiction, and customers could not write to them and get apples direct, because it would cost too much for freight. Mr. Marshall: The apple crop a year ago, especially the crop that we grew up at Arlington, was sold, part of it, to one of the Lincoln wholesalers, and this man had ordered our salesmen not to put any brand on the end of the barrel. He said that he wanted to put his own brand on that package of apples when he got it into storage. We did not put a brand on the outside, but we put a card in the middle of every barrel. We thought it would be quite a job for these wholesalers to open up all those barrels and take the card out of every one; but we felt proud enough of those apples to want people to know where they came from. I don't know whether Mr. Emery got any of those apples or not. That was a year ago last Fall. I am satisfied that the moat of the growers of Eastern Nebraska, men who are trying to produce a good product, really prefer to have their brand on the end of the package. I think the most of this trouble comes from irresponsible dealers in apples who go out and buy apples in quantities on the trees and do their own packing. I believe there is where the moat of the trouble comes from. </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY A. Mr. Barnard, you told me about your packing. You are not ashamed to put your name on the barrels. That is true, and I don't believe that any of these other men are ashamed, and I don't believe for a minute that you people do things intentionally that way, but I do say that you are going to get a better price and you are going to make more money by taking your merchandise and putting it out yourselves and having it right. It is your business to increase the sale, and if you let those fellows repack those things you are at fault, when you let them get hold of your product and put it out to the pub - lic, and it is not graded up to where it ought to be; and you people should look after it and see that it is taken care of and that it reaches the market in good shape. You should know where it goes, and estab - lish some medium through which the merchandise must pass, and have it graded up and get a standard to go by; and have a law passed so as to do away with the fellows that send that merchandise out in the wrong way. Mr. Chapin: There is one point that I want to bring out just a little there. I think I can make you see what I mean. A bridge is no stronger than its weakest point. A dozen roses that we sell are no better than the poorest one in the desert. Take the cut run of the morning. We will say it is five hundred roses as it comes from the greenhouse. In that bunch, Nature seems to have provided stronger bushes for some and they have thrown a beautiful bud on a long stem and then they grade down from that throughout the five hun - dred; and they will run through just about in the percentage that the public demands, if we grade them. If we leave those poorer ones and better ones together, then the poorer ones are worth as much as the best ones in the bunch; but by grading those and sorting them we can get, for instance two and a half or three dozen that are worth $3.00 a dozen and then the others will be worth less than that. The public demand seems to have been created in just that proportion. Just enough of the trade wants that fine stuff to make that price right. and there is the balance of the trade that wants the other kind. Mr. Emery is right on that line. When you mix these apples all through the barrel you get no more for those better ones than you do for the poorest ones in the barrel. There is not an unlimited demand. If all were the fine ones we could not make the profit that we can by having some of the other grades too. Being both grower and retailer, we get the profit on this extra fine stuff. I believe the same thing would hold true in an orchard and would well pay that extra profit — would well pay for the time it required to sort those apples and put them up in a box. There is a certain class of trade in Lincoln that will pay fifty cents or seventy cents or a dollar a dozen for the fine apples. There seems to have been provided just about this proportion of fruit. Now if you don't want that demand it is well and good. We do in the flower business. We want just that trade, because it makes </seg>
            <seg id="p165">TREE SURGERY 165 extra profit. It costs no more to produce that fine rose than it does the poorer one. "TUBE SURGERY" K. G. Groesart Looking over the records of the meetings of this Society, I no - ticed that the old subject of "Ornamental Shrubs" has been threshed out, so I picked this subject because I thought it was one that we needed. We appreciate our trees much more out in this country than the people do in the Eastern countries. This is probably due to the fact that we have to plant the biggest percentage of our trees, whereas in the East most of the trees are natural. So I prepared a small paper on Tree Surgery- Tree surgery is rapidly gaining in importance and popularity, aa people are beginning to appreciate the value of preserving their trees. If trees were never attacked by insects or organisms which cause de - cay, never injured or broken by storms, or mutilated by animals and man, there would undoubtedly be a much greater number of large and healthy trees than exist at the present time. Hal-treatment of trees is common, nails being driven into the bark, wire girdles around the trunk, bark scraped, wheel hugs frequently tear away large pieces of bark and poorly insulated wires of high voltage often discharge heavy currents through the trees. Probably no tree ever experienced the ideal conditions, not even for a comparatively brief period of Its life, so that trees, like human beings, may become unhealthy as a result of infection produced by natural or mechanical causes, improper foods, air or water, or an insufficient amount of either, or they may become sick and die from the effects of noxious gases. The real aim in tree surgery is to repair the damage resulting from the neglected injuries. However, the popularity of tree surgery is due to the spectacular effects achieved and the influence of the "tree doctors" who shroud in mystery and foster the impression that a cer - tain inner communion is necessary between them and the tree to attain successful results. The operations, however, are simple If tree struc - ture, nature of decay and principles of treatment are thoroughly under - stood. Observations show us that if a limb is removed close to the trunk of the tree that the wound resulting is oval. As the exposed cambium offers less resistance to the flow of digested sap, it is accelerated, forcing rapid growth of cells, which gradually cover the wounded sur - face by rolling over it. The tree is composed of three main parts — the roots, the stem (trunk and branches) and the leaves. The trunk of the tree serves the functions of supporting the foliage and acting as a circulation </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 medium between the roots and the leaves. The roots not only serve as an anchorage for the tree, but as a medium through which moist - ure and mineral constituents from the soil enter and pass through the trunk and up into the leaves. In moving from the roots to the leaves it passes mainly through the sap wood, that portion of the wood which lies immediately beneath the bark and cambium. The sapwood is of a lighter color in many trees than the heartwood, that portion in the central part of the trunk and limbs. It varies from one-half inch to two incites or more in thickness, according to the kind of tree. It may be removed without causing serious injury to the tree, other than impairing its strength. I The most important portion, however, of any tree from the dpoint of tree surgery, is the cambium. It is this growing part, ted Just beneath the bark, healing wounds, covering cavities, and &gt; year adding a thin layer of cells over the entire surface of the . It Is the cambium that carries the digested sap through the , it having originally passed through the sapwood up into the leaves down through the cambium. The formation of all new wood and i, and the healing over of all the cut stubs and dead areas are due ly to the activity of the living cambium, consequently it is of utmost ortance that the cambium be protected from injury at all times. bark acts as a covering for protecting the cambium layer and thus « an important role in the life of a tree. When removing a broken limb, it should be cut off close to the trunk of the tree, the resulting wound is oval. It is generally found that cuts heal most rapidly along the sides, less so at the top, and least at the base. This is explained by the fact that the sap tends to flow in fairly straight lines, hence the greatest flow and growth are along the sides; consequently a long, narrow wound parallel to the trunk of the tree will heal much more quickly than a square or oval wound running perpendicular to the trunk. The treatment of all wounds implies the prevention of the en - trance of insects and fungi and the facilitation of healing. This necessi - tates a covering of some sort, of which there are two classes. First, those that disinfect or preserve the wood, killing the spores of the fungi and the eggs of insects, and second those that fill the wood and make it impervious to the entrance of parasites. The most common in use of the first type of covering are creosote, line chloride, and copper sulphate. Creosote is, however, most gen - erally used. In the usage of any of these coverings, care must be taken not to apply them to the cambium tissue on account of the injuri - ous effects, if a coat of shellac is first applied to the growing region the injury is not so marked. k White lead and linseed oil paint, coal tar, slater's cement, liquid ing wax, and asphaltum preparations constitute the second class, alt preparations are without a doubt the best, since they are </seg>

            <seg id="p169">TREE SURGERY 169 tough, elastic, and quite permanent. Such preparations mar be bought for this type of work or prepared at home by heating asphalt, melting it, and then incorporating a fixing oil as gasoline; and finally adding a body to the substance, as sawdust. Paints are good and easily applied but with slight age and exposure to the weather soon check, thus permitting the entrance of insects and fungus spores. During the last few years there has been a wide-spread popular interest in the treatment of decayed places in old trees. This work may be regarded as comprising three essential operations: first, remov - ing all decayed and diseased matter; second, sterilizing and water proofing all cut surfaces; and third, filling the cavities in a manner that will favor rapid healing and exclude rot-producing organisms. The most important feature of the first step is to remove all the diseased and insect eaten wood with chisel or gouges and mallet. The excavation must continue on all sides of the cavity until sound, unin - fected wood is reached. All water soaked heartwood as well as dis - colored wood must be removed. The bottom and all parts of the cavity should be so shaped that If water were thrown into the cavity it would promptly run out and none remain in any hollow. A cavity that is to be filled should be shaped so as to hold the filler, a cavity that is bigger within is far superior to one that is V shaped at the mou,th and tapering to a point. After the excavation of the cavity is complete, it should be fumigated to kill any borers that may be in the wound wood. For this purpose a teaspoon of carbon bisulphide is used to every cubic foot of cavity. The entire opening being covered with cloth or tar paper, and a piece of cotton saturated with the solution dropped into the cavity. If the cavity is sealed fairly tight with cloths, not allowing the fumes to escape, the borers are killed over night and filling of the cavity may be begun. Before filling, however, if the cavity has any great length, it should be braced by running %-% inch machine bolts from the side of the opening diagonally through the cavity to the back of the tree. These should be inserted every 12-18 inches, for the purpose of preventing the filling from cracking off from the sides, due to tor - sional stresses upon the trunk. The most common cavity filler is a 1 to 4 wet mix of Portland cement. The best cement, sand, and one-half inch gravel should be used. The cement should be mixed so that it will not crnmble, and Is then laid into the cavity with a trowel and brought out to within one - fourth inch of the cabium layer. The surface of the filling may be gone over with mortar, to give a smooth finish and, after drying out, a coat of tar is applied to water proof the cement. The usage of a wet mix of concrete necessitates the use of a form, which is either made of wood or wire netting. This is inserted into the cavity, the concrete poured in and then faced with mortar. The bolts will take care of any necessary reinforcements. </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 I Another and most likely the best material for filling cavities is laltum mixed with excelsior or sawdust. Asphalt is elastic while xete is stiff; it adheres to the wood while concrete does not, and is ;r proof while concrete absorbs water. The big disadvantage in usage of asphaltum is the difficulty of handling. The material eg in the form of little bricks or in bulk. In filling a cavity a wall it two inches thick is built up of asphalt, by dipping the bricks hot asphaltum and placing them in the opening of the cavity and lining the entire cavity with this material. As an extra precau - the bricks are nailed to the wood and to one another. The cavity ind the wall is then filled with sand, gravel or bulk asphaltum. wall is held from bulging in or out by braces of wire, running from back of the cavity in the tree. tThe exposed surface of the wall may be then smoothed by heating asphaltum with a blow torch and worked with a hot chisel until ectly smooth and until all crevices between the bricks are filled. I Another method employed in treating small cavities is referred as tinning. The cavity is excavated and treated as before, with the :eption that a ledge \ of an inch wide and hi inch below the nbium layer should be left around the edge of the entire opening, exact pattern is then made of the opening and the metal fitted. The tal is nailed to the ledge with galvanized gummed nails about one :h apart. Care must be taken to get the metal below the cambium that it can roll over it, otherwise it will be torn off by the pressure the growing callus. After the first year the callus will grow over » nails and there will no longer be any danger of the metal giving due to the strain of the rolling callus. The term tinning, however, only generic, as sheet copper, zine, galvanized iron, and sheet iron : used. Discussion Mr. McShane: I would like to ask Mr. Grossart a question about using carbon bi-sulphid for the packing. Carbon bi-sulphid is heavier than air and the borers sometimes work up into the tree and escape from the gas because the gas has a tendency to go down. If you take a test tube and close one end the incoming vapor of the carbon bi - sulphid will not go up into the upper end of that — there will always be some air In the end to keep it out. I wondered if there is anything later than that treatment. A. No, I really don't know of any. We use carbon bi-sulphid qnite frequently in taking care of decayed portions near the surface of the earth and we are able to get into the tissue below and into the root with the gas of the carbon bi-sulphid. I don't know of anything that we could use. However, Professor Hoppert is more familiar with pruning, and might have something to give us on that. Question: How about using hydro cyanic gas? </seg>
            <seg id="p171">171 A. When we use hydro cyanic gas we must have extremely dry conditions. As soon as we have moisture, the result is that we bant the tissue. Mr. Brown: We find that in fumigating buds with hydro cyanic gas that if we make it strong enough to kill insects we make it strong enough to injure the tissue of the wood if the wood happens to be wet. Chairman: Mr. Stewart of Omaha who was to give a paper on Hardy Perennials" is not with us, neither has his paper been sent in. I am especially sorry about this as we have tried several times to get him to talk to us on this subject, as he has made a specialty of that in Omaha for a number of years and would deal with the subject very intelligently. I will now read my paper on "Fall Bulbs: Their Place in Yard Planting." "FALL Ul'LBH: THEIR PLACE IN YARD PLANTING" L&gt;. C. Chapin I want to touch on what are called common bulbs, which include quite a variety of bulbs, and those alone are the ones I want to deal with. I hesitated a little in taking this paper at this time because of the trouble that they are having in getting the bulbs, owing to the war. But this subject is one of a good deal of importance. To show you how important: The planting of Holland bulbs has increased to such an extent that there was imported and used in the City of Lin - coln alone last year over a million bulbs. That is rapidly on the In - crease, and I am satisfied that if this year's planting had arrived in time there would have been a million and a half bulbs used in the City of Lincoln and surrounding points this year. The bulbs arrived, but arrived so late that the ground was frozen up when they came; therefore, no effort was made especially to place them. I presume the matter will not be crowded again until the war is settled and these bulbs can come in freely. There are several reasons for this tremendous increase. They come to us clean and smooth from Holland — tulips, hyacinths and all of those bulbs. They are just as sure to bloom as the sun is to come up. Take a sharp knife and cut the bulb open and your naked eye shows you many blooms right there. It is ripened, matured and all ready to spring forth, so that anyone is sure to reap the flower*. They will continue in planting for years. They are comparatively cheap by the dozen or hundred, and have an exceedingly important place in yard planting. I want to take them up in order of their blooming. </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 The scillas, crocuses and tulips come first, before the snow is off. They are small bulbs, running about fifty cents a hundred on the average. Their place of planting is the open grass spot. The flowers come small and not showy. The best plan that we have found of planting these, (or effect, is to just throw the bulbs by the handful and plant them just as they lie, just as though the wind had whirled them and dropped them there. That gives an effect in the Spring that is exceedingly pleasing. They come up through the grass. The ■cilia blooms first, a little baby blue flower of pleasing color, just a little higher than the grass — blooms in the snow. I planted some of those in my own yard seven or eight years ago, and they are just as good as they were the first year. To the passerby during the last •now it is exceedingly pleasing to see these little flowers peeping out of the snow. It is interesting to look out of the window and watch the passerby when they see these flowers. Maybe a boy goes by, stops and looks hard at the flowers, then looks all round and then stoops down and wraps something up in his handkerchief and carries it away. tThe tulip and crocus and snowdrop follow. Here in Nebraska would confine your planting to the scillas and the snowdrops. The uses seem to decay too quickly and are good practically for only first year. The next in importance are the early tulips. These bloom us - ually by the 15th of April. By the early tulips I mean the Yellow Prince, thistlewood and Cottage Maid. These grow the height of about eight inches. If your yard is of normal nature, they should be planted in square or compact masses, but if in a sweeping landscape, their following the lines of border is the ideal place. Put them in rather thick, and in masses of cdlor together, planting them to a depth of eight or ten inches in the border. Other tender growing plants may be planted between when their season is past. We have found that three years is about as long as they can be left in the ground and give good bloom the following year. Then they must be dug up and the decayed old bulbs thrown away and the good bulbs replanted. That way a continuous bloom can be had, though they gradually get smaller. They don't get smaller for any other reason than that we don't take care of them in this country. They could be grown the same as in Holland if we took as good care of them. But coming as they do at $1.50 to $2.00 a hundred, the American people cannot take time to give them any attention, so that it re - quires about every fourth year to replant them. These come in all colors, yellows and reds predominating. These are followed by the narcissus. The narcissus run is a large family. There are about ten or fifteen kinds suitable for this locality here. Trumpet Major or daffodil is a durable flower. It will run for ■lz or eight years without deteriorating or running out, forms a new bulb each year — all of the narcissus family do in fact. They run in </seg>
            <seg id="p173">FALL BULBS 173 the shades of yellow and white. We planted a bed of one kind twen - ty-two years ago. and they are as good today as they were when they were planted. They were planted in a driveway and the teams drive over and it does not seem to hurt them a particle. I have seen the ground very hard packed and the winters come on and the driveway ia not used in the winter time and the ground softens up again, and the poeticus narcissus crop up again. That bed has never been touched since it was planted. The hyacinths follow the narcissus. These do not seem to be as satisfactory for Nebraska. The leaves are shaped in such a way that the rains beat in and carry dirt and dust in, and then as the flowers grow up they appear to be dirty, and do not make clear colors. I pre - sume one could overcome that my mulching his hyacinth beds with chaff or leaves. Then we come next in blooms to the most gorgeous one of all the bulbs. That is the Darwin tulip. They run in all of the shades or red, blues, lavenders, and yellows. We have planted these Darwins and have cut just from the open ground, flowers with stems thirty-two inches long, and as large as a teacup. These are planted in long rows, just as you plant a farm crop, cutting them for the flowers. The stems are so thick that you hold them in your hand and they will hold out as straight as a lead pencil. As you hold the flower up it is transpar - ent, opalescent, almost you feel that you can see through it. Of so much strength these flowers are that cutting one and just laying it on the table over night it is scarcely wilted, and will keep for weeks in water, gathering strength and beauty all the time. Of course it arrives at its greatest beauty just at the time it begins to decay. We have not planted these flowers in profusion except for the last two or three years. There is something peculiar about them, which we hare not found out yet. In the wet season we had a great many of these bulbs go back. They did not bloom at all last year — that is, not sat - isfactorily. (I am talking about the ones that bloomed the year be - fore.) They hardly bloomed. We felt rather discouraged with the idea of their continuing from year to year, but this year those bulbs came out as good as the new ones that were just planted last Pall. How long they'continue in that I am unable to say, but they are worth while even for one year's planting, for think of a tulip coming that early at that time of a year with a flower as large as a peony and in those colors that cannot be gotten in any other Spring bulbs. At this same time come the Parrot tulips. They seem to have been so named from their colors. The flowers have fringed edges. They are produced on a stem as long as the Darwins, but not as strong. It is liable to lop over on the group, and they must be planted very thick to get a massed effect. The Darwin stands up straight and can be planted a foot apart and gives a gorgeous effect. In the Parrots you get the colors that you can get in every other Fall bulb. It seems </seg>
            <seg id="p174">174 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY impossible that a green flower should be pretty. I have seen the green flowers, but I want to assure you that when you can mottle that flower with streaks of red and yellow that the green stands out as green as the parrot's wing, and is gorgeous in its beauty. The next are the Breeder tulips. These are used, as their name indicates, for breeding of new varieties. They are very sturdy and very strong, and will never run out. We have some that have been planted for twenty-five years and have grown stronger than ever, never have been replanted and grow in clumps producing in summer a-nd spring six or eight or ten flowers. Of course there are that many bulbs that have accumulated in the ground under them. They will produce but one flower a year, but these only come in the browns and rather of the duller colors. They never have appealed to me, other than the hardiness and the length of time that they last in the ground without being dug up. fl believe that those of you who are in the nursery business or the florist business, can't help but find all of these bulbs, but espe - cially the Darwins and the later varieties of tulips, an exceedingly profitable bulb to handle and sell. These are so easy to grow that a beginner will have as good success as an old hand. They are a good thing to start people on, because if they can plant some of these bulbs and see the flowers blooming it is very encouraging to plant other things. We have found that we can afford to give away to a man that has never planted anything a bunch of tulips if he will plant them. He comes back and says, "Sell me something else, I want to try some - thing more, I have had such good luck with these." You have got him started. I have in mind one person, rather a well to do person here in the city, that had never taken any interest in planting — just let the grass grow in his grounds. She was in the store one day and I was talking of planting, and I said, "I just want to ask you as a favor to me to take some of these bulbs and have a man plant them back in the garden — I don't care where. I just want you to plant them any - way." And I picked up about twenty of these bulbs and gave them to her. She came into the store in the summer time and spoke about how well they were doing, and the next Fall she came in and bought $85 worth. I thought the tulips were paid for. Now I mention that to show the tremendous possibilities of han - dling these bulbs. If you are simply a grower or planter, I want them to appeal to you as such an easy thing to grow. They last a long time, and they come in the Spring and put you in mighty good humor to go ahead and plant something else because they are so easy.

            <seg id="p177">177 A. Yes, we have. I guess that anybody that plants anything has trouble with moles or gophers — either one. They seem to like the tulips. They like all these bulbs — go through and follow the row and cut them right up. We had tremendous losses at first with those things. I remember those bulbs (hat we used for forcing. We plant those in trays close together, and then clear off a space of ground out in the open and put these trays side by side and give them water and cover them up and then cover with manure to keep them from freezing, and then go out in the winter time, commencing about now, and carry them in and bloom them and cut the blooms and sell them in the store*. We usually put in from fifty to sixty thousand bulbs in this way. One Spring we discovered that the moles and gophers, pocket gophers, had gotten in there and cleaned the whole thing out — practically four - fifths of them. Well, that was rather a heavy jolt, because there were probably four or five hundred dollars' worth in the bed; but we had been asleep at the switch, and let it go at that. The next year we got some tin and dug a trench around and put the bulbs inside, be - cause we had not succeeded in getting rid of the gophers. Then I happened to be up at Seward doing some planting for Harry Jones. Mr. Jones had two or three hundred acres of the prettiest alfalfa I ever saw in my lite, and he took me over to look at it, and I could not see a gopher hole in it, and I asked him what he did, and he said he didn't have any trouble with them at all. He outlined a plan. It is mighty simple and I will hand it to you now. He took raisins and strychnine. Just good old bunch raisins, and went to the corner grocery store and got strychnine. He sticks the strychnine into the raisin with his knife blade and shuts it up and drops into a bottle until he gets the bottle Mi He said that at one time his three hundred acres of alfalfa was in such condition that he thought he would have to plow it up. He started a man through row by row, and the man dropped the raisins into the holes as he went along. It took him about two weeks. He found that by having a man take one day a week or two and going on horseback that he could cover the whole field in a comparatively Bhort time, and he just turned the job over to him. That was part of his work once a week, and later on once in two weeks. Now we came back from there and tried this, and I want to say to you that it is a howling success. There is nothing to do it. We had a small patch of alfalfa. Why you could not walk across there, let alone, ride across; because there were places where the ground would give way under you. W« hired some of the boys around there to kill the gophers at ten cents apiece, and there was nothing stirring. They would bring them in, but it didn't seem to make any difference. We just took those raisins over there, and it was very successful. Mr. Dwyer: Did you find any dead moles? </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 A. No, we did not look for any. We knew they were dead. We have caught dozens of them in this tulip bed in boxes and they would crawl outside and die. It is a very simple process. You find the runs, and it is very easy to find the pocket gopher's run. When you have gone out in the morning and seen a dozen fresh little piles of dirt and put in the poison, and then don't see any more piles of dirt, it would be useless to hunt for the dead gophers. We have tried everything else — the gopher-go and poisoned wheat, and had no success. But we suc - ceeded with the raisins. Mr. Marshall. A mole will eat the kernel of a plum pit. We had Kcrop of plum seedlings ruined, practically, that way. The moles st lived up and down that row, and we would find a half a gallon of 11s in a place. They seemed to carry them together and eat them there, and we knew it was moles by the tracks. We could not get at them, but if we had knov.-n this we might have gotten them. We didn't think they were making such a complete job. They ate the pit, and I think that if they would do that you could poison them. Question: I have had several tulips beds destroyed by moles and I have been questioning the advisability of buying some screen wire and making a fence around the tulip beds. We have an old harvester wheel and fill that with tulips and we havo not had very much trouble with them taking it out of that little bed. I am pretty sure that a male will eat a tulip bulb anyhow. LMr. Dwyer: The government experts say that they have examined usands and thousands of moles and that they won't eat anything but animal matter. The mice do most of the damage that they laid up against moles. That is what the government experts say about it, and I rather believe they are right. Meeting adjourned. </seg>
            <seg id="p179">THE POTATO AS A FOOD 179 Thursday, January 17, 2:30 P. M. Meeting called to order with Professor Howard presiding. Chairman: This afternoon we have tried to vary the program by having a talk on the value of the potato crop as a food. Miss Julia Vance, Acting Head of the Home Economics Depart - ment of the University, will talk to us on the subject of "The Potato as a Food." THK POTATO AS A FOOD Julia Vance We are considering a most familiar food, common to the Ameri - can dietary, used three times a day in many cases — in fact the potato is a very much over-worked vegetable. We are familiar with the potato used in many different ways. It seems that we do not need to have very much information of the potato as a food, but rather what to use in its place to offer a variety in the diet. But we cannot afford to be disloyal to the potato as a friend. It is produced In all sections of the country, and by far the greater proportion is used for food. We know from this very fact that by virtue of its mild flavor, we do not tire of it readily; it can be prepared in many attractive ways; it is easily stored and transported, as well as preserved, being available at all seasons and under all climatic conditions; it is rea - sonable in cost in comparison with its nutritive value; and it dilutes the more concentrated foods, such as meats and cheese and foods of the protein type. I never think of speaking in favor of the potato, but I think of an experience I had on a dry farm in western Kansas. First the wheat was destroyed and then everything else that was green and growing, and in the Fall the potatoes were the only crop we had to harvest, but we did have a very good crop of potatoes. It was a very bounteous harvest and we appreciated it when it was our only source of income, and the only crop that showed the value of our work. The food value of the potato varies somewhat in the different types of potato. It contains from 75 to 79% water; 18 to 20% car - bohydrate, chiefly starch; 2 to 2.5% protein; 1% ash, and .1% fat. The new potato has more sugar in it than the old more mature potato. That is the reason we enjoy eating potatoes before they are quiet ripe. We have a special pleasure in eating the new potatoes when they come in the early summer. Now all foods must supply these food - stuffs, and we get them from various sources. We must have protein for growth and repair of the cells when they are broken down; car - bohydrates and fat for energy with which to do our work and also </seg>
            <seg id="p180">180 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY for protein; water and minerals to regulate the body processes. The latter foodstuff has the function of constructing tissue and bones aa well as keeping up the muscle tone, cellular tension, alkalinity of the body, etc. Our chief source of protein we think of as being the meats, egg yolks and milk, especially from the animal protein. But we get from our vegetables the vegetable protein and that can be substituted for the animal protein. We are realizing now that for three-fourths of our need for protein we can substitute vegetable protein for animal protein. The stockmen are realizing that it takes seven pounds of corn to yield one pound of beef, and five pounds of corn to yield one pound of pork, and that it is very much more economical to eat the food that you need in its natural state as far as possible, and then let one-fourth of our protein food come from the beef and pork. We find the vegetable protein equally good as compared with the animal fat. We must have, however, for growing children a certain amount of the animal fat — that is the fat we get in milk and all the dairy pro - ducts. We can get the fat from the yolks of eggs and there is the fat from the leaves of vegetables. We do not think of that being a good source of fat, but that is the reason a cow can grow to be a life-sized cow. We do not use them as proteid foods as such. Water we get from a very direct source, and get it from all the food which we eat, and if the foods are scarce in water they must absorb the water when cooking in order to become soluble. Even potatoes absorb the water when they are cooked in boiling water. Mineral salts are found in all the different vegetables. They are found largely in fruits and vegetables and are a very important ele - ment in both. There is another material, growth-regulating in itself, called vitamines or growth accessories which contributes to growth and de - velopment. This can be obtained from either animal or vegetable fats. Of this we have the two types. The first we call Fat Soluble A and it is found in egg yolks, butter fat, leaves and cod liver oil. The sec - ond type, Water Soluble B, we get from almost all of the foods which are not cooked — in seeds, vegetables, fruits, etc. These are a com - paratively new discovery, but are very important from the standpoint of food value. Now the potato must be considered in the light of the needs which we all have in our bodies. And how does it measure up? We call the potato a starchy vegetable, because it has more starch than any - thing else, and it does contain less cellulose than almost any other vegetable. Our potato never tastes woody as the celery does when it la over-ripe. Celery, however, must not be under-estimated, because it does give bulk to our diet for the human stomach has no capacity to digest it. (There is no distinction made between the different types </seg>
            <seg id="p181">THE POTATO AS A FOOD 181 of carbohydrates in a given percentage composition, but the cellulose adds bulk to the food, a necessary function, stimulating the peristalsis or muscular activity of the digestive tract. The protein of the potato is receiving a great deal of attention. The chief work was carried on by a 309 day space of experimentation, when the patient lived on potatoes and margarine — with other foods low in nitrogen such as the onion, strawberries and prunes, 6 to S grms. sufficed to keep a 70 kilo, man in equilibrium. Mrs. Rose of Columbia University, became interested and experimented to see how quickly nitrogen equilibrium could be reached — that is the out-take and in-take become normal. The results show that the equilibrium was established the fourth day, and was maintained for seven days, demonstrating that the potato nitrogen is of high nutritive efficiency in spite of the fact that only 63% of the nitrogen is in the form of protein. This is very significant. More will follow no doubt in the near future, as a result of many investigations. But the significance of the potato as a food has centered around another group of the foodstuffs, and that is the group called the min - erals and the dietary factors — the growth accessories. Calcium, phos - phorus, iron and potassium are present in the potato in goodly amounts. When any vegetable yields one per cent mineral it is of value in the diet. The average serving of potatoes has enough min - eral salts in it to neutralize the acids of two average slices of roast beef. Beef in the body is in acid form. We have to guard against that, and the older we grow the less meat we should eat, because every person has a tendency to acidity, and if it is carried too far it Is called acidosis, and it is a very serious condition. One of the best safe - guards is plenty of vegetables, and the potatoes, containing the variety of mineral salts which they do contain, are very valuable. One of the serious features of the restricted diet of last winter was the sub - stitution of rice and other cereals for potatoes. AH over the country people were saying, "Substitute rice for potatoes." That sounds very good because rice is starchy and they thought it was a very good sub - stitute. Of course that substitution was not so general as it might have been because they say the men don't like rice as well as the women do and they wanted potatoes. But the serious part of it is that rice doesn't contain the mineral salts. Substituting rice for potatoes. and then serving it with meat meant we had two acids, which would undoubtedly mean an acid condition. From that standpoint, the prin - ciple was bad. But we have had a good crop of potatoes this last year, and need not consider this substitution this winter while we are sub - stituting so many other foods. Comparing potatoes with flour and bread, %ne may buy three to four times as much calcium and three to five times as much phosphorus in ten cents worth of potatoes as in flour or bread; and on the same basis of comparison from two to four times as much iron as in flour </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY and ten times as much iron as in bread. So the potato compares with flour and bread very much to the advantage of the potato, and we cannot depend upon bread this winter unless we are using perhaps an excessive amount of whole wheat bread. I wonder how many of you have thought of the banana as being very closely related to the potato. I had not thought of it until some material came to the office the other day showing how very similar their food composition is. They show close similarity in total car - bohydrate and mineral content, though we have never thought of the banana as a potato substitute. The fact that the banana may be eaten raw is of interest from the dietetic viewpoint, since this is a very good source of "vitamines." All vegetables are specially valuable in a dietary in which white bread is used; white flour loses its growth producing property in milling. The water solubles which are present in fruits and vegetables to a large extent are not destroyed by the canning, unless cooked at a very high pressure, or unless they have been allowed to stand from season to season. We do not cook pota - toes in the pressure cooker so often as we do beans. I think in the mountains they cook everything in the pressure cooker, but here we dn not find that necessary. We do need to consider the value of the potato from the stand - point of the growth accessories. In connection with the knowledge ot the new substances and closely allied with the knowledge of growth, has come about much investigation of the so-called deficiency diseases — anticorbutis property it is called (preventing scurvy). Scurvy was so common among sailors and is present among children where the diet is very limited in the slums, and where there is malnutrition dur - ing the early years. If the potato is given to the person restricted in that way, there will be relief in a very short time. Fruits, vege - tables and milk possess the antiscorbutis property, probably due both to the predominance of base-forming ash constituents, and also to the presence of the growth accessories. Knock knees, bowlegs, and lack of development of the teeth, and lack of general body tone may be attributed to lack of these growth producing substances, and such vegetables as potatoes will help very much in relieving these condi - tions. Observing the potato in this technical way one can see that it is a most important factor in the dietary, and it is not any wonder that we have formed such a habit of using the potato as we do when it has so much food value as it has. I wish to speak of cooking of the potato, for this is very important. We cook potatoes to make them soluMe, and cook them only long enough to make them soluble, and in the process they are made digestible. Cooking increases the digesti - bility, from 68 to 73% of the protein is then digestible, and 92 to 99% of the carbohydrates. Some people like to eat potatoes raw, but there has been a good deal of argument over the digestibility of raw </seg>

            <seg id="p184"/>
            <seg id="p185">THE POTATO AS A FOOD 185 potatoes. Formerly we thought it was absolutely necessary to cook all etarcli at least twenty minutes, especially the starch loosely woven among the cellulose. There is plenty of room for the starch grains to swell and be made entirely soluble. The protein is made quite di - getttiblc in the process of cooking. The method of cooking is very important, and we like beat of course a well-cooked, mealy potato; like to have it dry and so that it will easily break apart; and this can be obtained only in one way. The temperature must be absolutely right. It must be hot enough 10 swell the starch grains quickly. This is the reason we like it baked in a hot oven. If the process is not carried on quickly, the po - tato will become soggy. Some people have the habit of putting pota - toes into cold water and then having it come to the boiling point, and some people do not care for salt on the potato because they say pota - toes will mash so much better if salt is not put into the water when they are cooking, and other people like to put the lid on the potatoes. All of those things are quite bad. Potatoes should be cooked in salty, boiling water, with the lid ajar. If they are not cooked in this way you do not get the white color and mealy texture which you wish to get. The best results can be accomplished by cooking the potato in its own moisture, that is by baking or by steaming. The reason for this is not for the value of the starch so much, but we get the swelling of the starch in its own water. A slow oven is worse than boiling however, the heat must be gerat enough to cause the cell walla to be broken. Too rapid boiling over-cooks the outside before the inside is made soluble. Mr. Williams: Should you cook them with the jackets on? A. I was just going to speak of that. The chief avenue of waste with the potato is in the peeling. Women vary very much in the way they peel potatoes. Some people say it is quite an index to a woman's sense of economy — the way she peels the potatoes. First of all, we waste the skin and the material directly beneath the skin, which is supposed to be the very best part of the potato as far as mineral salts are concerned. We expose the soluble surface altogether in remov - ing the peeling, and then we cut it into pieces, as we do in scalloped potatoes and thus expose that much more surface, so that we hare a very large waste in paring potatoes in that way. It has been esti - mated that by preparing the potatoes in these ways I have mentioned we may waste 51% of the protein and 38% of the ash, while In cook - ing properly the loss of protein is 1.6% and 4.9% ash, the ash being very soluble in the water. Then to summarize some of the points. The potatoes as a uni - versal food are very valuable. We have great need of Just such food. The potato is a good starchy food — containing a good soluble starch when it is properly cooked, either by steaming or baking or boiling — that means continued boiling and cooking only long enough to make </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY the starch soluble, which is from twenty minutes to half an hour, de - pending upon the amount of potatoes cooked, and the time of the year. When substitutes are made for potatoes, be sure you make them wisely. Do not substitute grains; do not substitute cereals for pota - toes unless you use plenty of other vegetables. Wheat flour, losing all of its grossness and all of its mineral salts, is a very poor food with - out the additional vegetables and fruits, which we have counted on so much. Rice alone is quite inadequate. Another way of saving in the use of the potato is by using the liquid, because the mineral salts are so valuable and we also get the sugar, and the soluble starch some - what driuted. The liquid may be used in bread-making, in soups, sauces and gravies. There is a new practice among the physicians which I question just a little. I feel that the potato is such a good food that there is no need of trying to claim virtues for it which it does not have. One of these is the use of potato water in infant feeding, as physicians are deciding that it is perfectly adequate to use malted milk if they can use potato water with it. I feel that that is an apology for a poor milk supply, and there is no reason to suppose that one can get the growth accessories and mineral salts needed by the growing baby, if whole - some milk can be obtained. This practice is very poor dietetics. Question: Do you think the baked potato will retain more of its food value than any other? A. The baked potato certainly has the advantage. A poorly baked potato, however, is worse than any kind of potato, because the starch has not swelled out. Maybe you have tasted some pre - pared that way. They are very bad, but if they are put into a hot oven, not too high a temperature, but hot enough to penetrate through several potatoes at one time; then you are sure to get all the food value preserved if you do not burn them by too high a temperature. The best potatoe to choose is a netted skin with a corky appear - ance and a certain crispness when cut. I am not infringing upon Pro - fessor Howard's territory, but I think many people seem to have a tendency to like best perhaps the yellow or whitish skin potatoes. I like the pink just as well myself, and I see no reason why the quality cannot be just as good, but there is a certain crispness and corky appearance that one looks for in a potato. You can tell it just as quickly as you cut the potato open. It is the kind people like best to eat. An interesting set of data has been collected from fifteen Ameri - can dietary studies representative of ordinary food habits. This shows that potatoes represent 5.3% of the total calories per day, 3.9% of the total cost of food, 4.2% of the total protein, 8.7% of the total phos - phorus, and 13.5% of the total iron. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">187 Potatoes then are very important as a source of energy, of protein and as a source ot phosphorus and iron. They are one of the mo«t economical and useful foods which we can have in a dietary. Discussion Sir. Keyser: She did not say anything about French fried potatoes, and that is the only kind I care much about. A. French fried potatoes — what happens to them is this. The starch grains are coated over with fat, and the potatoes which would ordinarily digest in the stomach, are not digested until they reach the small intestines. That would be all right if the starch remained in its natural state, but in spite of the mineral salts which are there, a fer - mentation takes place which causes gas to form and which causes indigestion and brings about a case of excessive acid in the stomach. This is a very common affliction. French fried potatoes for children and people with a weak digestion are one of the worst foods we can eat, and certainly not necessary. I think it is absolutely unpatriotic to eat French fried potatoes when we are trying to conserve fat at this time of the year. Question: Did I understand that it is better to have the lid re - moved all of the time in boiling potatoes? A. Yes, it is. Question: In boiling other vegetables too A. It is very much better to have the lid ajar at least, and also with the cooking of other vegetables. You cannot get nearly as attrac - tive looking vegetables when they are not cooked in the open air. When you are cooking a large amount of potatoes, and have to wait a long time anyway, I would have the lid just ajar so that the steam can escape. In cooking a small quantity I would keep it off entirely. The starch then absorbs only enough water to make it soluble, and If drained immediately the potatoes will be dry and mealy and very good to eat. Mr. Keyser. I just want to defend my patriotism. You see my wife doesn't eat potatoes at all, and it seems to me that I ought to have some French fried potatoes once in a while. Mr. Williams: I saw an article in the Journal recommending a potato flour, advocating its general preparation, and maybe you hare had experience in its use, and in combining it with wheat flour in bread. A. I have used the potato flour, but it is impossible to get it on the market. It is very satisfactory, but it is just like everything else. Any carbohydrate food, such as in the sweet potatoes, or squash or pumpkin or any of those starch vegetables can be subtituted for flour to the extent of one-fourth, and when we are trying to conserve wheat it is a very good way to substitute. A potato flour makes a particu- </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY larly good bread. It is very fine in texture, because of the fineness of the starch grain, and the starch grains are finer and smaller in the potato than in many of the other starchy foods. You will have to make this allowance, however, that the bulk is not so great in the loaf when you use potato flour. It makes a smaller loaf because there is no gluten there. Mr. Williams: Is the manufacture of this flour practical? A. It is very practical, especially when you think of how many potatoes we have, and when we have a good season of potatoes we have an excessive amount. It seems to me entirely practical. A potato flour can be used for the thickening instead of cornstarch for gravies and all sorts of uses where it does not depend on gluten. Mr. Hoppert: Will the bread become sour more quickly with po - tato flour? A. No, it does not. You are familiar with the bread being made with the cooked potatoes. When the starch is made soluble the yeast will heat the potato and will allow the ferment to continue long enough sometimes to get the acid taste. I did not add the potato flour until after the sponge was made, and then the bread was perfectly sweet and wholesome. In fact I think it is sweeter than with the bread flour, because the potatoes have sweetness in them. Question: Is the potato flour all of the potato or a portion, and bow is it obtained? A. I am sorry to say I have not looked into the industry enough to tell you about that. President Howard: I am sorry to say I am unable to answer that question. I will say that I was reading a publication recently issued by the Government on some lessons for American potato growers from German experiences, in which they outlined several ways by which potatoes may be used — ways that we are not using them in this coun - try but using them in the European countries. They did not outline the method, in this publication, of making potato flour. He did out - line the method of using it as a stockfood, as a source of starch and a source of alcohol, but did not mention the method of converting it into flour. Perhaps there is someone familiar with the method. Miss Vance: I do know that it is washed out from the cellulose just as you can wash almost all the starch from the potato and you can get from one potato perhaps two ounces of pure starch by strain - ing it through a cheese-cloth, and I have understood that that is the method they use. Question: There was a question last year about drying the pota - toes so that they could be preserved and shipped a distance. Does that destroy the food value of the potato? </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA POTATOES 189 A. There is always a loss whenever you expose surface with potatoes, and dried foods lose in their growth accessories very quickly. They begin to deteriorate. Of course the people of Alaska could hare no potatoes but dried potatoes and potatoes have been furnished by Germany to Alaska until the time the war began. Of course we cannot be selective in a case like that, where it is the only source of food in places like Alaska, and in long cruises, and where the navy has needed a supply. But as a substitute for the original potato, they could not be considered for a moment. Chairman: I have heard the question asked recently why it is we have not manufacturing concerns in our commercial potato growing sections of this state to utilize the cull potatoes — meaning by the culls the small ones, the ones partially diseased, the bruised ones, the ones slightly frosted; why it is that we have not some means of convert - ing this waste, and a lot of it is waste, into a source of income. I think that is a good question to raise. I think it is a matter that should be looked into more carefully. Mr. Williams. The Potato Growers Association should consider the fact right there in their central plant where the potatoes are grown. Chairman: I may say that that undoubtedly will be one line of work that will be taken up in the near future by the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association. The next subject is "The Need of Organized Effort in Maintain - ing a Reputation for Nebraska Potatoes," by Professor R. F. Howard. T'niversity Farm, Lincoln. "THK NKKD OK ORGANIZED EKFORT IN MAINTAINING A ■KPl TATION KOR NEBRASKA POTATOES" R. K. Howard I would like to make it plain at the outset that I am not posing as an authority on the potato industry in this state. I am not pos - ing as one knowing very much about the industry, particularly the growing end and the handling end of it. However, on the other hand, I have had sufficient opportunity the last year or two years to come in contact with the potato industry of the state, as the Secre - tary of the Potato Growers' Association, to make me feel that I have two or three suggestions that might be worth considering, if cotv - sidered by a sufficient number of growers. To begin with, I might mention just briefly a few things that relate to the tremendous growth that the potato industry has had in this state the past few years. It has grown in the past few years, I shall not say how many years because they have been growing potatoes </seg>
            <seg id="p190">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 190 on a small scale for twenty or thirty years in western Nebraska, but within a comparatively short period of time the potato growing indus - try of western Nebraska particularly has grown to such an extent thai we may now rate it as one of the leading agricultural enterprises of the state. Last year there were between three and four million bushels of potatoes produced in Nebraska. Perhaps half this amount was pro - duced by growers of western and northwestern Nebraska. I think I am not far off in that estimate. This is of course a tremendous output. It represents probably four million dollars to Nebraska. Of course they sell to the consumer for much more than that. Now after having passed through Nebraska twice in studying the potato industry of the state during the growing season, I find that there is sufficient land in western Nebraska, where these potatoes are grown, not yet under the plow, that could easily be put to potatoes, and with comparatively little effort. There is no reason why the state should not raise four or five times as many potatoes as now, provided it has the proper method of distribution to dispose of them. I might say that, according to my observations, I am led to believe that the methods that are now in vogue in disposing of our crop of potatoes could probably be bettered somewhat. I am not going to say — I am not going to attempt to place the blame on any particular group of persons, because I thoroughly am convinced that it is largely the result of this unusually rapid development of a new industry in a new country that has caused the methods that are now being used in disposing of the crop of potatoes. I am thoroughly convinced that within a comparatively short time things will adjust themselves in such a way that it will be done in a more business-like way than it is being done now. I shall not attempt to place the blame upon the railroads nor upon the growers nor upon the wholesalers. There is just a condition of affairs existing at present, I will say, in the com - mercial potato producing section that is an undesirable one in some respects, but I am convinced that it will right itself in a few years. I shall have a few words to say in regard to methods that the Potato Improvement Association is going to use in an attempt to remedy the situation as it now exists. I want to say a few words at this point regarding the seed situa - tion in general — the potato seed situation of this country. I am speak - ing now of the other states as well as Nebraska. The Irish potato is a plant that when grown under certain con - ditions will produce tubers that are not as suitable for seed purposes as if it were produced under different conditions. That is recognized by all growers. Now it is recognized throughout the central states and throughout all of the southern states that the Irish potato de - teriorates if grown there over a great number of years without being replenished again by new seeds from the north. I say that is generally recognized by all commercial growers and, for the most part, by </seg>

            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA POTATOES 193 growers that grow for their home use only. An attempt was made by the Department of Horticulture of our State University to find out what the factors were that are concerned in that. An attempt was made to determine these factors and to see whether or not they could be controlled. Largely through the efforts of Dr. Emerson, formerly with the Department of Horticulture here, a series of experiments were started about twelve or thirteen years ago, to determine that. He shipped potatoes in each year for a great number of years, from Minnesota and Wisconsin and tested their yielding abilities with pota - toes of the same variety that had been grown here in eastern Ne - braska the previous season. He found, by taking an average of such tests for eight years, that potatoes even though grown here a single season under ordinary methods of cultivation, would lack about twen - ty-three to twenty-four per cent on the following year of yielding as much as shipped-in potatoes grown the previous year in the north. In other words, our potatoes here, and I think the same thing is true even to greater extent further south — we may expect a great deteriora - tion in the yielding power of potatoes if grown here under ordinary methods of cultivation, even if grown only a single year. Now it is acknowledged that in the northern states they have two or three conditions that we do not have. One of the conspicuous dif - ferences is the temperature difference. They have cool nights in the latter part of the growing season in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Maine. I dare say their mean temperature difference is as much as ten or twelve degrees. That is one difference. Then they have more humid conditions there than we have here. An attempt was made in these experiments to imitate the Wisconsin, Minnesota conditions so far as the temperature and moisture were concerned by growing some pota - toes under a straw mulch applied thick enough to keep down weed growth, and it was found that potatoes this way yielded practically as much as the shipped-in potatoes. I am speaking now in averages. The average for eight years' tests showed that to be true. I mention that, and rather emphasize it because it has a direct bearing upon some other things that I am going to say. Last year we tested the seed potatoes grown in the western part of this state with the potatoes grown in Minnesota and Wisconsin to see how they would yield in comparison. Our altitude in western Nebraska is between four and five thoTisand feet in many places, and therefore we have very cool nights as compared with our nights here and further south, the latter part of the growing season, though we don't have, perhaps, as much moisture in the soil as they have in the potato growing sections of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Maine. I may say that the test that we made last year seemed to indicate that the potatoes produced in the high altitudes of our state would yield as heavy as potatoes from Wisconsin and Minnesota and the Dakotas. We </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY are going to give that another test this year and the following year. We don't care to base definite conclusions upon the results of a single year's work. At present some potatoes in western Nebraska are being sold in the south for seed potatoes. Some grown in western Nebraska are being sold in eastern Nebraska tor seed potatoes; but I dare say less than two per cent of our total output in western Nebraska is being used for this purpose. Last year at the meetings of Organized Agriculture in this room we had a hall' day session on the potato, and at the end of that session it was decided by the growers that an organization might be a bene - ficial thing, insofar as the potato industry in western Nebraska was concerned, and the motion was. made that steps be taken to organize a Potato Growers' Association to ■n along with these various other agriculture associations meeting h re this week.

The reason we started on tin work — some work has been done in other states recently that indie ate that definite progress can be made by selecting properly in our o-called varieties of potatoes.

Doing it out there because that is where we know we can tw potatoes without having to ship them from the north. We can ;p our selected stock therefore. So we went into the potato busi- </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA POTATOES 195 ness in four of the principle potato producing counties of western Ne - braska and selected in each case a thousand tubers, ordinary tubers not particularly large but of medium size, but we tried to select them as fairly uniform and typical of the varieties as we could. We cut each of those thousand tubers into four pieces through the stem end. planted them in four hills, put down a stake, planted the next tubers in four hills and put down a stake, so that we were able throughout the growing season and also at digging time, to distinguish the yield in each case from each of these tubers that were produced from every other tuber. In other words, we produced four hills from each tuber. These charts show the great variations that we found in those tuber units, each unit being four hills, from a single tuber. Before some of you ask me this question, I am going to answer it. This great varia - tion you see here is not due to favorable and unfavorable conditions, because we oftentimes have this great variation in hills adjacent each other in the same row, so you could not possibly account it to one particular unit being favored and the other not favored so far as moisture, plant food or cultivation, etc., are concerned. That was a rather startling thing to find, to say the least. I am not going to say that all of that difference is the same kind of a difference. It probably is not. I am not going to any anything so very definite at this time, until we follow it up with at least one year's work to prove. or to find out to what extent that difference is a heritable difference. I will tell you this though, men, we have sufficient evidence at hand to make this statement. It appears as though most of that is a heri - table difference. I will tell you why. This particular chart is a chart that I made from a hundred hills at random from our plant in the irrigated valley of the Scottsbluff country. This man whose place we worked on went into his cellar and picked out enough potatoes of this variety, the Bliss Triumph, of about twice that size (shows size) and planted an acre adjoining the plat we were experimenting with and then he used ordinary potatoes and planted the rest of his eight acre field. On this acre where he selected his potatoes we harvested five hundred twelve bushels of potatoes. The other seven acres of that field, that was a part of the same field, averaged, he tells me, more than one hundred bushels per acre less than that. Now for fear that I might leave the wrong impression, let me hasten to say that I am not recommending large potatoes for seed potatoes. I want to explain why I think he got that high yield in terms that will not mean that you necessarily have to use the big potatoes from your patch for seed potatoes. Before I tell you what my explanation is, I want to tell you some - thing else. Adjoining our experimental plat where we had this work going on, this man on whose place we were doing this work planted one row after we finished planting our experimental potatoes and used nothing but small potatoes that would go through the screen. I </seg>
            <seg id="p196">196 harvested those, and they produced at the rate of less than one him dred bushels per acre. Now let me couple these things together Question: Did he cut those potatoes. A. He planted most of them whole, and some that were large enough he cut in two. If the potato did not weigh more than an ounce or two he would plant it whole From these three tests that were going last year on his place, the place where we got this great variation and on the other plat where he got less than one hundred bushels per acre, it seems to indi - cate to me that in the case of his big potatoes he probably set a standard so high that he got potatoes only from high producing strains of potatoes. He did not get potatoes from these low yielding potatoe rit is, he had his standard so big that he automatically eliminated all these unproductive strains. Where he used nothing but the small E«, he set his standard so small that he had a great proportion i se low yielding strains represented. Now, I am convinced that it te possible for us to select seed potatoes only from high yieldir strains and eliminate most of these one year with another. I am no going to attempt to answer this question that you may ask. "How carefully would we have to select each year in order to keep ing other unyielding strains?" I don't know. That VI rt to find out. It is a very important question to be answ I may say that this chart seems to indicate that then- is i r the range of variation in this man's stock. He d Mr. Williams: Does each one represent a separate grower's exper ment? A. Yes, each one represents a different grower. This represents till another (showing charts). This represents a dry land condition nd this an irrigated condition of the same variety. This represents le stock grown by the man you are speaking with there, and this by is neighbor two miles away that grew his potatoes on dry land. The man had a greater total average yield here than his neighbor had. Bach one of those sections &lt; indicating i represent a unit, which is a relative thing here. Each one represents a yield of a tuber unit. I lave it set down here in figures, but you can't read it that distance way. The top one represents fifteen pounds of potatoes, and the next welve and one-half, and the next five and a quarter. I made it to how the relative difference more than anything else. Question: What was the distance apart of the four hills? Elow yielding strains in it, and while his average yield of potatoes less probably less than this, he does not have anything like a t variation as this man has. I happen to know that this particu- lar stock here has been grown under irrigation continuously for ten rears. </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA POTATOES 197 A. Under irrigation, we planted them about fourteen inches apart; while under dry land conditions we planted twenty about twen - ty-two inches apart. We tried to plant them about the way they plant them commercially in the section. I mention that, men, because that one line of work is one that the growers are now taking up in western Nebraska to improve their potatoes by selection methods, and it is going to be an important matter, because they are now going to take steps to win a seed trade for western Nebraska potatoes, and hold it. That of course in turn will mean that the higher quality of potatoes that they produce under conditions that they know they can produce them under will be of very great importance. Steps have been taken recently to determine just what the re - quirements of seed potatoes for the south are, and steps will be taken this coming year by the Association to meet these requirements. The Potato Association members should be congratulated for doing busi - ness in that way. They are going to find out what their trade de - mands and are going to supply that demand. I have investigated the matter the past month or two and have found that the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Louisiana, use each year ap - proximately two and one-half million bushels of potatoes for seed purposes. I do not know to what extent this two million and one-half bushels is imported from Minnesota, Wisconsin and Maine. I do not know what proportion of it each year is new seed potatoes, but I do know that over 90% of the seed potatoes shipped in to those states come from Wisconsin, Minnesota and Maine, and the mountainous sections of Tennessee. We are furnishing less than five per cent. Well, you can see what that means if our growers in the high alti - tudes of our state can win a seed trade. If it amounted to even no more than a million and one-half bushels that would be practically one-fourth of our total output in the western part of our state. You can see what it would mean in relieving the congested situation that exists in western Nebraska at digging time. You can see what an influence it would have on the industry, insofar as raising the quality of potatoes as grown in this state would be concerned, since they will, necessarily to meet that trade, have to meet a certain standard, certain size, relatively free from disease, and so on. It would have a far-reaching effect in cultural methods, methods of handling and dis - tributing, making it possible to greatly increase our acreage of pota - toes, and it would better distribute the season in which potatoes may be moved. The potatoes that would be held over for the southern states could be moved in the Spring, whereas most of the potatoes for table use would probably be moved at digging time. I say the most of them, there is no reason why half of them perhaps should not be held in western Nebraska. Question: You think, then, that the soil and climate of the north - west part of this state would be equal to anything for seed? </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY A. Everything that we have done so far indicates that — indi - cates that the potatoes produced in our high altitudes under dry land conditions would be as good for seed as in Minnesota, Wisconsin potatoes. We are also going to determine the relative value of irri - gated potatoes in western Nebraska, also under high altitude condi - tions — the relative value of irrigated potatoes and dry land potatoes. There is a great diversity of opinion regarding that matter. We have already made an arrangement with the collegian experiment stations south of us to give that a fair test next year. They are going to test our irrigated potatoes, our dry land potatoes, and compare them with shipped-in potatoes from Minnesota, Wisconsin and Tennessee on a sufficiently large scale that we can draw conclusive opinions from them. They have kindly consented to do that. That is another step in working up our seed trade. I am so convinced that they will find our potatoes of value as seed potatoes, that we are taking these other steps at the same time. tThis has been a rather incoherent talk, but I intend that it should iln to my subject upon the necessity of organized effort in estab - ng and maintaining a reputation for Nebraska potatoes. tMr. Williams: How do you expect to carry on further this line experiments — selection of units? Do you select your seed for next ir from these best hills and continue on that same line of work in ler to raise the standard of yield? A. We are going to do this: Last year at d erstand we dug each of these units and not only counted the pota - oes but weighed them. We have already selected approximately fifty the highest yielding units from each of these various places where ley were grown. We selected about fifty of the highest yielding ones and about twenty of the lowest yielding ones. Next year we will plant lose, not on a four hill scale, but on as many hills as all the potatoes n this tuber unit will plant, so it will he on rather a large soale; and &gt;y dealing with so many units and dealing with so many of these degenerate units" we are calling them now, we will be able, I figure, o determine rather accurately the extent to which this great variation a heritable variation. kl figure that we will be able to speak authoritatively on that next We have these potatoes saved in the northwestern part of the in each of these various communities. Mr. Williams: What would be about the average yield from those hifto yielding strains? A. Up to a certain point (points it out on chart) there would be an average of six hundred bushels to the acre. I told you that this man on an actual acre adjoining this plat had a yield of over five hundred bushels per acre. Our average tuber units averaged four hundred and eight bushels to the acre. </seg>

            <seg id="p200"/>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA POTATOES 201 Mr. Williams: Your main tests were made with the Early Ohio? A. No, quite on the contrary. This (indicating) represents Early Ohio and that Triumph. These two represent Pearl. This rep - resents Triumph. That other place we had both the Early Ohio and Triumph. Question: Don't you believe that the most vigorous potato and the largest will produce better and more potatoes than those that are not so vigorous? I have been inclined to think that in regard to all plants. A. I will say this is true. I don't know as it will answer your question satisfactorily, but in going through our tuber unit fields we could associate these high yields in practically every case with a fairly large top growth, if that is what you mean. Now, I don't know as that is true in all cases. I rather venture this though, as a statement, that you can't get a very high yield without a satisfactory top growth. Mr. Williams: I was noticing last summer in passing through the fields in the Black Hills — I could not help noticing with surprise that the foliage was very scarce — very scanty foliage in the fields there to what we have here; and I was wondering how they could obtain high yields from such a scanty looking foliage. That was in the latter part August. A. Now you are getting on to an entirely different question from what I was speaking on just now. That is quite true. Relatively speaking, they have much less top growth there than we have here, but I was speaking of the potatoes grown out in northwestern Nebraska and was answering that man's question in that way — speaking of that as a given place. But yet your observation has been identical with my observation — that the top growth in western Nebraska, particularly in dry land conditions, is remarkably small as compared with condi - tions here. Mr. Williams: It seemed that you could hardly call it a rank growth anywhere there. A. In Kimball County it is not uncommon to go into a patch of potatoes and have them come up two and one-half feet. It is not uncommon in dry land conditions, and in Box Butte County particu - larly one would be impressed with the scant growth of potato foliage. Yet, you might get a hatful of potatoes from one hill. That is very striking. Question. In my experience in growing potatoes out west, and I have been in eight or ten different states, I get larger tops in the low altitude than I did in the higher altitude. I would prefer the medium sized seed. I have tried experiments. I don't want the large pota - toes. My experience has been those of medium size and those a little below the largest have been the best. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY A. Lots of men have opinions based on general observation. These were selected to a given size. There is the result. (Shows.) This man from the same bend in which we selected this, selected some twice as big and raised his yield over one hundred three bushels per acre. This man picked out the least potatoes and got one less than one hundred bushels per acre on that field. Question: What distance apart do you recommend to plant, and how many eyes? A. Where? Question: In this locality A. One plants the rows about the width of corn rows and four - teen or fifteen inches apart in the row. Is that about the distance apart you plant them, Professor Hood? Professor Hood: Yes Question: Would you cut more than one eye A. There has been considerable work done on the importance I having large and small seed pieces and pieces with one or more eyes, believe it has been found that the yi?ld is increased somewhat by iving fairly large seed pieces as compared with real small seed pieces, but I don't know as there is any evider.ce for or against having on* versus two or three eyes. I think that most people are of the opinion that they would cut potato pieces perhaps two to three ounces in sizt regardless of the eyes. Of course, if you are dealing with a big pot you are apt to have but one eye, but with a small potato you may two or three. Question: It seems to me that a large potato with few eyes would produce, better, stronger plants. A. I have heard that statement. I believe t dence that shows that if you have a potato plant stems coming from the ground, in other words from a seed piece with several eyes you will probably have approximately the same plant growth from that piece that you will have more small potatoes than you will have if there are one or two main stems. There has been some work done in one place that seems to indicate that. I don't know how conclusive it would be. Mr. Brown: Is there anything in regard to cutting the stem end off? I think that a man advocated the compulsion by the government of cutting that end off. I want to know if there is anything to that. A. Well, I think the best pathologists in the United States and abroad will tell you that if you have a certain disease that it is quite Ential that you do that. If you have a disease that will get into the ir, then you may cut it away. That is, the best pathologists recom - d that. I may say in that connection that some tests have been </seg>
            <seg id="p203">203 carried on in western Nebraska last year and year before last In aa attempt to determine the value of that. In this tuber unit work we started last year in every case when we started to cut a potato and found one with a brown discoloration. we laid it aside so that we made a note of that and started in there and knew where our tuber units were that had that discoloration. We were very much interested in noting those units. We found rery little difference in those units so far as that disease was concerned and in the units that did not show it at the time we planted; but there was a government man there at the time I was digging these and I called his attention to that. He is a man that has been Mat to Germany and has studied in Europe, and is supposed to know diseases, and he told me that probably the reason I did not find any differences there was because I was confused in thinking that this discoloration was a dangerous disease, when it was not. The chances are the pathologists are right after all. Mr. Brown: Would not it be well in putting out a statement of that sort to give some reason for it. The average man wants to know the reason. There was no reason given for that, cutting the stem end off of the potato. A. I think it is. This disease may be on the vine and just worked in a short way perhaps not over half an inch in the tuber, and it would be cut away at planting time. That is the reason for that recommendation I understand. Mr. Williams: The subject of size of potatoes has been mentioned. It occurs to me that there was an experiment made here that showed what the best results obtainable are from different seeds to the acre. As I recall it they got the best results from a certain eighteen bushels of seed. Do you remember about that? A. I was looking that up not long ago. An attempt was made there to determine the relative value of different sized seed pieces, and I believe that the test was made all the way from half an ounce up to about four or five ounce pieces, which would represent perhaps as low as six or eight bushels to the acre up to eighteen bushels to the acre. They found that there was a limit to which one could make the size of his seed pieces, when you take into consideration the mat - ter of size — the number of bushels that would be used. Instead of eighteen bushels, if I am not mistaken, it was about twelve bushels. That is, his difference between the sized seed pieces you would get was not justified. Mr. Williams. You get the best results from the twelve bushels? A. Yes, the size seed pieces you would get from using about twelve bushels of seed. That was for eastern Nebraska. We have men in our audience here that are among our biggest growers in western Nebraska. I am sure that they will be quite willing </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY to answer any questions if any of you are interested in cultural methods. Mr. Weber: Do you make a difference in the number or amount that you plant in irrigated or dry land? A. It varies possibly one hundred per cent. Mr. Weber: In Colorado about nine bushels to the acre, under irri - gation, yields the best. Mr. Pedrett. I usually make the mistake that I plant them too far apart, and we used to have the idea that the biggest potatoes were the best growers, but we see that the great big potatoes are not what the people want. Someone last year gave us a lecture in Kimball and explained how many bushels he gets per acre and how he plants, and he explained that it was absolutely unnecessary to use so much seed to plant an acre. Last year he said it was high and that it would cost about $40 an acre to plant in our neighborhood, and it looked pretty big. Instead of planting them three and one-half feet apart I cut them down to twenty-two inches, and thirteen inches apart. Mr. Howard planted his about seventeen inches apart. I always try to select them true to type. I had more than four hundred bushels to the acre, and people said they were the nicest, even, salable, potatoes that they had seen in the field. When I plant potatoes on the dry land, 1 don't usually get any. As far as seed potatoes are concerned, always my idea was to go into the bin where you have all kinds of potatoes, and try to pick out a potato that I think will produce a good hill. Last year our county agent was there and we took two or three days to cut these up. It is impossible for a farmer to go into the field and pick seed potatoes and say that they are all good. Some produce nothing and some a great deal. As to the size of the seed piece, my opinion was to always keep up lo a certain type. While potatoes were so high last spring we had large potatoes that were not true to type, and I would not plant them, whether big or small. But there were lots of potatoes that were a little bigger than a walnut, lots of them. So when we were planting, I said, "It is a shame to throw them away. I am going to pick them out and try planting some of them. If we don't get anything it is nothing lost, and they may come in handy." So in the summer time Mr. Wilcox was out, and I think Mr. Howard was out too. I went through the field and told them there were eight rows of culls in that field, and asked them to point them out to me. Not one of them could tell. Not that I would advise anybody to plant small pota - toes, but my idea is that they come from the true type. They pro - duced fully as many as the rest of the potatoes. Chairman: I would like to show you this chart. These two plats were grown on Mr. Pedrett's farm at Kimball last summer. (Indicates.) This chart represents the yield from the stock that he has been grow- </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA POTATOES 205 ing for several years under irrigation. This (points out) represents the same varieties of potatoes under dry land conditions. Look at the greater range of variation here in this dry land stock as compared with this irrigated stock. The total yield of the dry land stock was a little larger than this (shows), but I am confident that the lack of variation is due to the fact that he has paid more attention in select - ing his potatoes according to uniformity. He did not have much dif- ference, I will assure you, in that block of small potatoes that he planted, but you have not many Pedretts in western Nebraska that have been selecting their potatoes according to type. Mr. Davis, from Gordon, probably the biggest grower in Sheridan ciunty. is here. I would like for him to give us some of his observa- tions. He has probably had as much experience as any man in Ne - braska in growing potatoes. He has been a grower for thirty odd years perhaps. Mr. Davis, from Gordon: My best results with selecting seed po - itoes have been a good deal this way: I take a treated potato — treated according to government rulea, nd select from it. The best results, showing the largest difference in yield and types, etc., have been for me to take two baskets, with a digger ahead of the picker and pick out the select hills in one basket and the small types from dwarfy hills in another basket. Take care of those till the following season, and put them into the ground in the same conditions and give them the same cultivation. I am not care- ful not to plant many small potatoes, because my former experience has taught me that it is along the line of every other course of life that you follow — they will not produce so well — but I have gotten extremely good results from the large tubers selected from large yield - ing hills. I think that the reason some have good results from plant - ing small potatoes is because they select small stuff from previous year's seed that has been selected stuff. That is not nearly so apt to small tubers. I have followed this plan in raising seed potatoes mostly: Take those tubers that are from large yielding hills, and plant them in new ground, which I have plenty of, and keep continually planting the seed on the new ground, and selecting those large yielding hills. One year after another select a few. Just put in a day at it and you will find that you will keep yourself in pretty good seed, and another thing, your seed is not going to run out— *you will be raising nice, plump, uniform potatoes all the time. I have been a grower for thirty-three years and a dealer for twen - ty-two years. To give you a little idea about the condition of things along the line of different size of tubers. As a dealer I have my locali - ties to get potatoes from. For instance at one time in the Fall I had seventeen cars of potatoes in Omaha sent there to divert to different points where I could get sale for them. I got a certain potato from one locality because my former experience taught me that I could get </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY it there and that that potato suited the people to whom it was going. I plan my schemes to fit the people. This year I furnished potatoes that will average over two pounds to the tuber for the whole carload. I call them Government Number One. Twenty miles north of Des Moines there is a place that I shipped a few carloads of these select potatoes. I have more competition there than almost any place else, so I put the very best type of good potato that I had, and sent a man there to look after them. I got a report back that the potatoes were exactly as I had represented them, and that the large type of potato that I sent there was just what suited them. Now I might go down in here to a southern country with another type of potato. I only send a two or three ounce potato to a certain locality. That is what they want. In southern Iowa and noil hern Missouri they want a medium sized potato for seed. There is one thing about the large potato with us, and 1 think is so all over the western counties, and that is this: That non highland grown potatoes are stringy, pithy, or hollow in the centt They are solid and crisp and starchy. When I want to sell a 11 load of potatoes and if he sees a lot of large potatoes and hays, "An they hollow? Will you guarantee them to not be hollow?" I wil those potatoes open and put them in a place so that they will attention of the people, and guarantee them all the way be of that class. We put another class of potato on dow 1. Nebraska. I went down and put them off myself. I w As a fellow said, "John you are on the spot to prove to th the start that you have a good potato." I cut them open and p them up and told them that there was not two per cen A pithy potatoes in there. It is a perfect potato all the way xl Such things exist in the northwest and western pi w they are raised in dry land conditions. The first thing I ask a potato grower from am "How wet is your soil, etc.?" I can nearly always tell them the qualit of their potato, for the simple reason that I take into consideratio the first thing, the type of ground they have. With us in the western end of the state, everything that is most productive and the best quality that we can possibly raise is the small - est in quantity of above-ground growth of thp plant. Take, for in - stance, wheat. We have a macaroni wheat up there that grows a large yield of straw, and it won't compare with other kinds of wheat that will grow a smaller stem, a smaller amount of straw. Our grasses are just the same. We have the small grass that is extremely good. It is raised under those dry conditions is the reason of it, and it does not create a great big crop, but it is extremely good. The same way with our corn. We will have to stoop like picking up potatoes to get that corn, but we have the strength, and the kernel and the grade. We can't raise a large white oats successfully, because there is too </seg>

None of them grew higher than my waist. I had an ex - perienced farm hand working for me and we were out with a binder. "Now," I said, "which of these is going to yield the best?"

Ralph Cooper, Assistant l'n&gt;li— .in nt Horticulture A great deal has been written on pruning and training trees and vines. However, most of the publications refer to methods used in eastern States or in the Northwest which are not adapted to condi - tions and varieties in the Middle West. There is a great demand for information along these lines in Nebraska, especially among the newer residents of the State, who are planting young orchards and vineyards. In order to meet this demand it is considered advisable to publish a bulletin which will incorporate the experience of practical growers and the results of scientific investigations. There has been considerable confusion of the terms pruning and training. The term pruning is applied 10 the various operations which consist in cutting off or removing certain portions of the plants. The term training, on the other hand, refers to the different methods of shaping the plant other than the cutting away of its parts, such as bracing to spread the tops of trees, tying the branches in certain posi - tions, etc. The term training is often used to denote the pro&lt; ■ changing the shape and the apparent direction of growth of a limb by cutting away certain of its parts. This, however, more properly belongs to pruning. Different methods of pruning must be practiced on different varie - ties and kinds of fruit and on trees of the same varieties hut of dif - ferent ages. Most varieties of fruit trees make a much more vigorous and upright growth while young than when mature, though soni 1 persist in spreading from the first. These spreading varieties need different treatment from the upright growers. In fact, every individual tree will require somewhat different treatment, for no two are just alike, though they may belong to the same variety. A must greater difference must, therefore, be expected between different varieties. In order to prune intelligently the pruner must understand the habits of the individual tree or at least of the variety. Especially is this true of the fruiting habits. He should know how and when to prune, so that the wounds will heal as quickly as possible, and so that the opera - tion will have the desired effect with the least possible injury to the tree. Wounds are healed by plant food elaborated in the leaves. This material takes an inward and downward course through the inner bark from the smaller to the larger limbs and to the trunk. As wounds very far removed from its direct path receive very little, if any, plant food, long stubs rarely, if ever, heal over. Cuts should be made close to, and paralled with, the limb from which another is being removed. ITiysiology of I'r utuim </seg>
            <seg id="p211">PRUNING TREES. VINES AND SHRUBS 211 This often leaves a larger wound than if the limb is cut straight across, but it ie one which heals more quickly. A cut made just above a bud or branch has a tendency to stimu - late a vigorous growth, because this is the only part left to utilize the water and plant food which formerly went to supply a much larger lieu A cut below a bud or limb has a tendency both to produce a thickening of the parts, because of the stored plant food, and to in - duce the formation of fruit buds. Water sprouts are the direct result of a disturbed equilibrium of the tree. Heavy pruning always pro - ducts water sprouts regardless of the season of the year when it is done. When the top of a tree is cut back, the overabundance of water and food materials supplied by the roots force dormant and adventi - tious buds into growth. Checking growth as long as the plant remains strong and healthy has a tendency to promote fruitfulness. A very strong growth is al - ways at the expense of fruit bearing. Overcultivation and manuring may often cause the p'.ant to grow so rapidly as to be unfruitful. Heavy pruning may do the same. Other conditions being equal, deep notching of the twig above the bud tends to produce a long, woody spur. Heading-in tends to start shoots from the lateral buds, and a strong vegetative growth results. Under normal conditions there is perfect balance between the top and roots of the plant. The top and roots must supply and support each other. If a large part of the top is pruned away, there is more food for the remaining branches. The result is a greater growth of these parts and rejuvenation of the plant. When plants begin to decline from general debility, manure or prune, or both, removing the weakest parts first. If it is desired to save any certain branch, a heavy pruning of the others will assist the chosen one. If the branches are too weak to rejuvenate, sucSers may be produced by heavy pruning, which may be trained into a new head. Heavy pruning will go further toward rejuvenating a tree which suf - fers from winter injury than any other remedy. If it is necessary to prune severely to correct the shape of the trees and it is desirous to avoid successive growth, the parts should be removed gradually. Heavy pruning of the roots tends to lessen the production of wood, since the food supply is cut off. Root pruning has the same effect as poor feeding. Fruit bearing is often determined as much by the condition and environment of the tree as by the kind and extent of pruning, and the fruiting habit is always more amenable when the tree is young than when it is o'.d. Any treatment which disturbs the equilibrium of a tree tends to modify its bearing habit. If trees have never borne, it may be possible to induce bearing: First, by changing the manage - ment of the land, so as to modify the supply of raw food material; second, by pruning or changing the methods of pruning; and third. </seg>
            <seg id="p212">212 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY by controlling insects and disease. Heavy pruning adds vigor and the fruiting habit is always more amenable when the tree is young than produces new wood. The orchard is thus renovated and rejuvenated. After two or three years, the trees begin to steady down and bear fruit, unless the orchard is allowed to lapse into its former condition. The common habit of heavy pruning every two or three years is one of the best means of keeping the trees unbalanced. Light pruning every year is moie beneficial than the same amount of pruning given only occasionally or in alternate years. Many varieties of apples develop long slender branches which break under a load of fruit, while some other varieties are liable to overbear periodically, often to such an extent that branches are broken with a load of undersized fruit. Such trees require two seasons to recover from the effect of overbearing, but the third year the process is repeated. Pruning may be, therefore, a means of thinning the fruit and of contributing to the control of the bearing habits of the plants. The bearing year of fruit trees may often be changed by removing the crop earlier in the season, but the tree tends to revert to its accustomed habit. Time to Prune There is no one season in which wounds always heal better than another. Healing depends primarily upon the cambium and cannot take place except when the cambium is active. The cambium is usual - ly inactive in late fall and winter, and there is a tendency for the tissues to die back about the edges of the wound made at this time. This is a disadvantage to the healing process. Pruning in the spring or growing season exposes the plant to bleeding. It is said that the sap sours on exposure to the air and injures the bark and cambium about the edges of the wound. This, however, is very doubtful. On account of the stubs dying back, pruning back of terminal growths had better be done late in the dormant season rather than early in the fall. The season in which pruning is done has some influence on fruit bearing. Winter pruning tends to produce wood, while summer prun - ing has a tendency to promote fruit bud formation. Plants cut in midsummer have power to adjust themselves, while plants which are pruned in winter have expended all their energy. Fruit buds must not be expected to form in the same year in which pinching or head - ing back is done. There is no question but that if heading-in is done before active growth has ceased it has a tendency to induce fruitful - ness by checking exuberant growth and by encouraging short lateral growths, or short spur-like branches in the interior of the top. The tendency of such branches is to develop fruit buds. </seg>
            <seg id="p213">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 213 Fruiting Habits of Pome Fruits Apples and pears have similar fruiting habits. The fruit is borne almost altogether from terminal buds on the ends of short, crooked branches, known from their habits as fruit spurs. Many varieties, however, especially when under irrigation, produce terminal fruit buds on the current year's growth and often in the axils of the leaves. All branch buds are alike in the beginning. Some, because of a more abundant supply of light and food, make a rank growth, while others for reverse reasons produce very short branches, which usually become or produce fruit spurs. This is good evidence that slow growth favors fruitfulness. The fruit buds give rise to both blossoms and leaves, producing six to nine leaves usually surrounding three to seven blos - soms. Under normal conditions on most of the standard varieties of apples, usually one, but sometimes two or more of these blossoms, set fruit, and the rest fall away. Pears as a rule set more fruit to a cluster than do apples, and crabs are famous for their habit of often setting fruit on all the buds in a cluster. When a spur sets fruit, its terminal growth is stopped; but one or more leaf buds are formed just back of the place where the fruit is attached. The following season these make a short growth, and at the end of the second season they produce new fruit buds. This ex - plains why trees form the habit of bearing in alternate years. If all the spurs are loaded one year, no fruit buds are formed for the next season's crop, unless they are produced on the current year's growth. Since these crooked, scarred little spurs are responsible for most of the fruit crop, it is not surprising that the man who frequently re - moves all but the nice, straight limbs from his trees in an effort to make them look symmetrical will never be blessed with a large crop. Fruit spurs when once formed remain fruit spurs and continue to bear for a greater number of years unless forced into rapid growth by abnormal conditions, such as excessive pruning or heavy applica - tions of fertilizer. Once a fruit spur is destroyed it is forever lost, and the loss cannot be replaced except by growing a new spur. This is often difficult in the extreme. In pruning apple and pear trees, then, it is of the utmost import - ance to preserve the fruit spurs. The pruning operation should con - sist in thinning out the top to admit air and light and never in removing the spurs, twigs, and small limbs from the lower portion of the tree. Pruning Young Trees After Planting When the trees are taken from the nursery row, a large part of the root system is left in the ground; the equilibrium between the roots and top of the tree is thus disturbed; and it is obvious that a part of the top should also be removed. Should the top be left un- </seg>

Trees which have not been cut back will often rt growing too vigorously only to die when the food and water, ich is stored in the plant, or which is easily available, is exhausted. kAll branches and torn roots should be cut back to healthy tissue, ving smooth cuts that will readily heal. Long, straggly roots should shortened, and any masses or tangled roots should be shortened 1 thinned. Heading the Tree tThe importance of low headed trees for this climate cannot be strongly emphasized, since hundreds of trees are dying in all Is of the West because of exposure to the sun and effects of high da. It is often necessary either to have additional protection, such burlap, cornstalks, paper, straw, or similar material surrounding trunk or to shade the trunk on the southwest side with a thin :e of wood set up in the ground. Low headed trees have other antages in that they afford greater ease in picking, thinning, prun - i and spraying, all of which operations can be performed more sfactorily and cheaply. Shaping the Young Tree I In training the trees, one of two modes may be adopted. One known as the pyramidal or two-story and the other as the vase ,pe. An exper' m ay combine the two. A combination is preferable the Middle West. I The pyramidal form preserves the leader, which is trained to ■m a central shaft to the tree. It has the advantage of more bear - ; surface, as the leader continues to grow, and in time forms what known as a two-storied tree. There are the usual objections to tall «s, on the other hand, in that it is difficult to secure good distribu - n of bearing wood, and some varieties, such as Gano and Ben Davis, b inclined to produce too many branches and to produce inferior lit. There is also the danger from high winds. Besides, much of B fruit is produced at the top of the tree and out of reach of pick - i. Even If it can be reached, it causes delay and extra expense in In the open-headed, or vase, form, the leader is done away with. Few limbs, usually not more than five, are chosen to form the top. By skillful pruning, the spaces are all occupied with bearing wood in this way, and tall trees are avoided. One of the advantages of the open head is that trees are not nearly so liable to die from canker or fire blight, for when a limb becomes diseased it may be removed without endangering the whole tree. </seg>

            <seg id="p217">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 217 The term low-headed is merely relative. Eighteen to twenty-four inches is considered low. Some growers start even lower. The trees should be well supplied with limbs at the point where the head is desired, and three to five of them should be chosen to form the frame - work of the tree. The others should be removed. The selected branches should then be shortened to a sound bud within 10 to 14 inches of the main stem. In case the arrangement of the limbs is such that this is impossible, the entire top should be removed with - out regard to branches. This will cause new branches to push out on the young stock. This is one reason why strong yearling trees are preferable to older ones. When a tree is headed back, great pains should be taken to make a slanting cut just above a sound bud. A sharp knife is the best instrument for this purpose. If the cut is made too far above the bud, the stub will die, and may admit disease; if made too close, the bud may be injured in the cutting. The position of the bud is of considerable importance. There is a tendency for the new limb to grow in the direction into which the bud points, though this is not always true, especially if a tree Is heavily pruned back. Subsequent Pruning of Young Apples and Pears The first five or six years is the most critical stage in the life of the tree, for the pruning given while young determines in a large measure its future usefulness. Immediately after being set out, the trees are pruned as already described. Every season thereafter for several years the tree will need more or less care. The first attention should be given to the number, size, and distribution of the scaffold limbs. Some varieties, such as Missouri Pippin, Wealthy, Oldenburg, etc., are much more difficult to prune and shape properly than Winesap, Black Twig, and other of the more spreading varieties. SomeMmes one or more of the scaffold limbs have to be discarded and new limbs trained to fill the vacancy. It is necessary to be constantly on the watch in order to secure proper shape. Leaders should be shortened about one-third to one-half their length, while the side limbs should be shortened one-fourth to one-third their length. All forks of both trunk and main branches should be avoided nearly as possible, to prevent splitting. All crossed branches or those growing back into the center of the tree should be removed and the top kept thinned out. The second year, pruning follows closely after the practices of the first season. As a rule, unless a branch is cut near a strong lateral, two branches will start, and some of the buds lower down will develop into shoots. It is a good practice to allow two of these to grow on each of the previous year's limbs. One should be left near </seg>
            <seg id="p218">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 218 the end and the other farther back and be placed so as to avoid the formation of crotches. They should, however, be cut back one-half to two-thirds of their length and the laterals shortened to one or two buds, so that they may shade the branches and later develop fruit spurs. Some horticulturists recommend the removal of all these lateral spurs to protect the tree from fire blight, but on apples, at least in this region, all these spurs should be retained as long as possible. Spaces should be ft ltd by choosing branches that grow in the general direction of the vacancies, by cutting to a bud that is on the side to - ward the opening. The third season, the trees should require less attention than before. Surplus branches and those that rub or are inclined to form crotches should bo removed. Very vigorous growths should be headed - in. If a leader is desired, the treatment is practically the same, ex - cept that it is allowed to grow with little heading-in. Branches should be allowed to develop on the leader at regular intervals. From this time on, the question is merely to retain good form, to prevent the formation of crotches and cross branches, and take out the excess branches so that .sunlight may be admitted and the amount of bearing wood controlled. Should it become necessary to prune to produce fruitfu'.ness, it should be done lightly and in summer. To many fruit growers of the Middle West, pruning bearing trees seems to be an extremely questionable undertaking, and it is true they have many arguments to support this belief. In the East it is neces - sary to thin out the trees and admit sunlight in order to mature and color the fruit properly, but in the Middle West under conditions of intense sunlight and low humidity good well-colored fruit may be grown without much pruning. There is sometimes danger of thinning out the trees too much and allowing both fruit and tree to be injured by sun scalding. Then, there is not the pressing necessity in the West which there is in the East of pruning to prevent the development of fungous diseases on the fruit and foliage, these pests being much less troublesome in drier climates. Again, there is evidence which indicates that trees often become infected with diseases, especially Illinois canker, through pruning wounds, though with proper care this may be avoided. There are many other and often unreasonable excuses offered by the man who does not prune. Many contend that cutting away healthy branches is entirely contrary to the laws of nature and that when it becomes necessary the trees will prune them - selves by shading off the superfluous branches. They support their argument by citing the shading off and self-pruning of trees under forest conditions. I'l-uniim l&gt;i-:ii'iuu I r«&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p219">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 219 In order to secure this self-pruning of trees, they must be planted so close together that even while young the branches interlock and interfere with each other. Such conditions are not ideal orchard conditions. The trees form long, slender, upright, growing branches which produce very little fruit. This, however, is well, for if they were loaded with fruit they would break under the strain. To pro - duce frnit in abundance, trees must have broad spreading tops. They form such tops only where light reaches them from all sides. Inter - fering or superfluous limbs on such trees are never shaded off, but must be cut off. There are other reasons which make moderate pruning necessary: It may be the means of accelerating or retarding the growth of plants. Severe pruning is often the only means of rejuvenating old trees. Pruning may produce larger and better fruit. Many varieties are prone to overbear, and unless this is prevented by proper pruning or thinning, the fruit will be small. With such plants as the peach, where the fruit is borne on one-year-old wood, the size of the crop can be regulated according to the vigor of the tree. Pruning is often necessary for the removal of weak, injured or diseased parts. When pear blight or Illinois canker once becomes established in a tree, the only remedy is the knife, and it is often necessary to remove limbs weakened or diseased from other causes. Pruning facilitates the operation of tilling, spraying, pruning, and harvesting. As before stated, in order to secure desirable results, a knowl - edge of the habits of growth and fruit bearing of the different kinds and varieties of fruit is necessary. Some varieties have a tendency to overbear more than others, and the more pronounced this tendency the heavier should be the pruning. The semiopen headed form or the story and one-half tree is the type best adapted to the Middle West. To secure this form, the thinning out of the top should not be over - done by removing large branches, for this makes large holes In the top where there is no wood whatever. It should be confined to rela - tively small branches of about one-half to three-quarters of an inch in diameter. The fruit spurs should always be preserved, and small branches that are not fruit spurs should be saved as far as possible, for these may be trained into bearing spurs. There is a tendency on th« part of the amateur pruner to prune for looks and to strip off these small branches and spurs in order to secure symmetry. The damage caused by two or three such prunings can never be overcome. All dead and diseased wood must be removed. Sometimes, how - ever, as in case of a large cankered limb, the removal of it would throw the tree badly out of balance. Where the limb is on the south side of the tree, the removal of it would expose the trunk and other </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Urge limbs to excessive heat. In either case, if the cankered area is not too large, it should be treated and the limb saved by having all of the cankered or discolored wood removed and the wound disin - fected and covered. For removing the diseased wood a two-inch gauge and a mallet make a valuable addition to the pruning kit. In treating trees for canker we must divide them into three classes. The first includes those which may be cured profitably by treating. In this class we have trees with all degrees of infection, from a small cankered spot on one limb up to several large cankers on one or more limbs. In general practice it is best to remove any diseased limbs en - tirely, unless the infections are recent or, as before stated, the limb is badly needed. In such cases it is well to try to treat and save the limb unless the disease has progressed too far. In treating the limb, all of the cankered and discolored bark and wood must be removed. It is safest to cut back of the cankered spot at least one inch into clean, growing bark. The wound must be make pointed above and below, because if left square a wedge-shaped piece ot dead bark will result, which will encourage a new infection. After removing the canker and making a good smooth cut, the wound should be disinfected and covered. Another important step in treating the canker is to cut the trees back heavily and force an abundance of new growth. Trees with heavy tops compared to the root systems, or those which have been weakened by any cause, such as drouth or winter injury, suffer most severely from Illinois canker. Cutting back the top so that the roots can better supply water and plant food to the remainder, goes a long way toward correcting the trouble. The second class of trees is composed of those which are so badly cankered that it would be unprofitable to try to cure them, but which will still bear a profitable crop of apples. This is the most dangerous class of all. The layman sees no reason why he should sacrifice a tree as long as it will bear fruit, and leaves it in his or - chard to scatter millions of spores to his sound trees. The writer does not recommend that these trees be cut down, but that they be prevented from scattering the disease. This can be done by cutting away and burning the dead limbs and by keeping the remaining cankered surfaces covered with a heavy coat of asphaltum. The third class of trees is composed of those which are so badly diseased that they no longer bear. For this class there is no remedy but to cut them down and burn them. All leaders and side branches should be shortened to the desired length. In doing this, care should be exercised never to leave stubs, but to cut back to a side limb. Crossing and ingrowing branches and those growing in such positions that bad crotches are likely to be formed should be removed. All </seg>
            <seg id="p221">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 221 water sprouts should be removed except where they may be trained into limbs to All vacancies, or to replace fruit spurs on a limb which has been robbed. If left for limbs, they should be severely cut back, but if for bearing wood they should be cut back to two buds. This practice should be repeated each season. Essentially the same principles apply to pruning bearing pear trees as to apples. A mature pear tree does not require a great deal of prun - ing, if proper at trillion is given while young. Growers often accept the upright growing habit of the pear as inevitable and make no effort to train ii otherwise. This is a mistake. There is no reason why a pear tree cannot be grown with a moderately low head if trained while young. Pear trees should be low headed for the same reason that apples should. It is a hard matter to head-in mature pear trees be- cause of the large amount of growth thrown out the next year. When heading-in becomes a necessity, always cut two side limbs. There is truth in the saying that pear trees will not stand pruning. Some varieties demand severe pruning in order to keep them within bounds. Just how much pruning to give is a question which the grower must decide for himself. The main object should be to thin the fruit, im - prove the quality, and encourage regular bearing. Heavy pruning often induces heavy growth. This should be avoided if possible, since pear blight is more destructive to trees making rank growth. The infection usually tains entrance through the blossoms and more tender twigs. This is very serious when it occurs on short fruit spurs, and often becomes necessary to remove them from the base of the larger nibs as a safeguard. Summer pruning is beneficial to pears as well uppl Fruiting Habit* of Peaches The fruit bearing habits of peaches are quite different from those of apples and pears in that the fruit is borne on one-year-old wood and the buds are always simple, i. e., either flower buds or leaf buds, whi'e in the case of apples and bears they are often produced from the same bud. The greater number of buds generally develop in groups of three. A fruit bud is on each side of a leaf bud in the axil of a cluster of three leaves and near the center of the season's growth, though on the weaker, more slender growth one fruit bud and one leaf bud may appear together, or either may appear singly, scattered along its entire length. On rank growth, few buds are found except near the tip, and these are scattering. The fruit bearing area of a peach tree gradually grows higher and farther away from the body of the tree, so that the pruner has two objects in pruning: (1) To furnish new wood to bear fruit and (2) to keep it within reach of the pickers. There is a strong tendency for the fruit bearing area of young peach trees, especially the leaders, to grow out of bounds and become too high, if not carefully pruned back. Too heavy pruning, however. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 222 may cause the tree to produce a light crop the following year, but it can be relied upon to repay the owner the second season. Pruning Young Pencil Tree* Practically the same rules may be followed in pruning young peach trees as are adhered to in the pruning of young app'.es and pears. Three or four main scaffold branches are left at the end of the first season. These are shortened to about twelve inches in length and allowed to divide into three or four branches during the next season's growth, with about the same heading-in and multiplication of branches for the following season. After this time the form of the trees should be well established and less severe pruning should be necessary. Stone fruit treee respond readily to proper pruning. They differ from the apple, as before mentioned, in habits of fruiting, in that the fruit buds are axillary and not terminal, and the fruit is borne on the one-year-old wood. The grower should take advantage of this knowledge when the tree is young and keep it within bounds. The tree will continue to need some thinning out and cutting back, but it is a mistake to prune for fruit too soon. It is impossible to prune young peach trees properly and leave fruit buds. The more rapid the growth of new wood the nearer the tips the fruit buds will be found. To secure a well-spreading top and have the fruit wood near the ground, it is necessary to prune severely the outside branches. Few fruit buds will be produced the following year. After the third year, the top of the tree should be cut back, but no more small wood shou'd be left in the body of the tree than has been left before. All subse - quent pruning should be to keep the top fairly open. After the fourth year the trees need considerable thinning out and some cutting back. The fruit should be thinned out by cutting the fruiting wood and with such other pruning as the spread of the tree needs to keep tli" fruiting area near the ground. It will ordinarily be found most satisfactory to prune peach trees to a broad, spreading, round-headed form, and to start with the fruit - ing area as close to the ground as possible. The manner of producing fruit-bearing wood makes this necessary, for even with good pruning the fruiting area of the tree grows farther out of reach of the pickers. Pruning Bearing Peach Trees In pruning bearing peaches the object should be to cut out enough wood to produce a strong new growth each year for fruit bearing, to remove superfluous fruiting wood, and to give the tree the desired shape. A mature peach tree should make an annual growth of 15 to 18 inches. This will necessitate the removal of much of the new </seg>

            <seg id="p225">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 225 wood. The heavier pruning should be done earlier in the spring, leaving the clipping back until later. Some wait until the danger of frost is past. Then, should fruit buds be killed, a heavy pruning is given. If they escape, only about half the longest branches are re - moved. The fruiting wood should be kept as near the ground as possible. No peach orchard should need a ladder longer than 6 feet. The depth of fruiting area will seldom exceed 4 to 6 feet. An attempt to increase the fruiting depth will usually smother the inner growth of the tree. The spread should be increased rather than the height. The top should be pruned enough always to secure fruiting wood for the lower part of the tree. Peach trees may be dehorned to overcome the effects of winterkilling. Fruiting Habits of Apricots, Plums, and Cherries Apricots produce their fruit on one-year-old wood as does the peach, but by far the greater part of the fruit is borne on very short branches, which resemble fruit spurs. These short branches, how - ever, do not differ very much from the other fruit bearing wood of the tree except in vigor of growth. The buds here as on the other wood are axillary, but they are borne singly. On rank new wood the buds sometimes appear in small clusters. As in case of the peach, the buds are simple. They differ, however, from the peach in that they are developed in the axil of a single leaf. Plums and cherries resemble each other very closely in their fruiting habits. They differ slightly in some ways, but not any more than some varieties of plums differ from each other. They are alike in that the fruit buds, containing two to three flowers and a few often rudimentary leaves, are found both on short spurs and on the strong growing new wood, and in both cases from lateral buds. Few fruit buds of cherries are found on the vigorous new wood, the spurs being by far the heavier bearers. Japanese plums resemble apricots in their manner of fruiting. On many of the European and American varie - ties, fruit buds on new wood are common, while in some they are very rare. Pruning Apricots, Plums and Cherries The same principles are followed in pruning plums and cherries as with peaches, but they are pruned less severely. The small spun on apricots and plums often bear for a number of years, so that it is not necessary to force so much new growth as with peaches, but since the bearing surface does occasionally have to be renewed they are pruned more severely than apples. Much care must be exercised during the first few years of growth of these plants to secure a proper distribution of the scaffold limbs. Japanese plums and sweet cherries have a tendency to divide into </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY shoots of nearly equal growth and thus form bad crotches which split easily unless properly pruned. The same general principles apply to the pruning of apricots, plums, and cherries, as apply to apples. Plums and sweet cherries need much more severe heading back than sour cherries, to keep them within bounds. Apricots bear early and abundantly and on short spurlike growths much more than on the new annual wood of the tree so that after bearing age is attained little annual pruning is necessary except to remove dead or interfering limbs. The body of the plum is subject to injury from sun scald. To avoid this trouble, the trees should be headed low. Young trees of most varieties will need cutting back and to have the tops trimmed to develop the desired shape. Some varieties will need pruning to spread them, while others will need heading back to nil up the top of the tree. The bearing plum tree usually receives only a moderate amount of pruning. Domestics are pruned very little after they reach the bearing age. The native plums will be improved in quality of fruit by moderate pruning, while the apricots and Japanese plums will respond satisfactorily to rather heavy pruning. When neglected they tend to overbear in alternate years. They should receive an annual heading-in and thinning out to force vigorous new growt It is a common impression among fruit growers that mature cherry trees need no pruning. A great deal of this is due to indiffer - ence. It is true, however, that the greater part of the pruning should be done during the first three or four years. Good fruit is borne on the cherry on one-year-old wood and on short growths or spurs. Tf terminal bud is usually a branch bud. The axillary buds are most fruit buds. The cherry trees will, therefore, stand only moderai pruning. Trees overpruned produce an excess growth ol nt'w woe and few fruit buds. The general plan should be to keep the fruitii in area as near the ground as possible, to shade the trees, prevent sun scalding, and to encourage the growth of fruiting wood throughout the entire top. Sweet varieties will need heading-in to keep them within bounds. When weak fruit buds set and fail to produce fruit, it may be taken as a sign that the tree has not been pruned severely enough. Heavy pruning in the dormant season will often correct this fault. Lack of blooming is often due to excessive pruning. Fruiting Habits of drapes Grapes differ from the tree fruits in their fruiting habits in that the fruit is borne upon shoots which grow from canes produced the preceding year. Theoretically, each bud left on one-year-old canes will produce a shoot. The shoots which come from short jointed canes are the fruit bearers, and have from one to three or four clusters </seg>
            <seg id="p227">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 227 each. Therefore, the next season's crop can be estimated by consider - ing the vigor of the vine and the number of buds left. Usually more buds are allowed to remain than would be needed were every one sure to produce fruit. Thirty to forty or even fifty buds are left, de - pending upon the vigor of the vine. This allows for 10 to 20 per cent defective or weak buds. The position of the buds or fruit bearing wood, so far as the quantity and quality of fruit are concerned, is of secondary Import - ance, though it is claimed by some that the third to the fifth bud* of the cane produce more fruit each than the first or the second. It ften necessary to renew a part or even the whole of the top of the vine. It is desirable to have the bearing wood as near the roots as possible. To secure the best results, the pruner must also consider the age. size, and vigor of the vine, and its environment, such as location, climate, soil, and the care it has received. The paramount object in pruning grades is to secure the maximum amount of good fruit, and at the same time maintain a strong, healthy plant. In some cases the vine must be retarded by leaving considerable new wood. Often, nes must be heavily pruned, especially where they are badly diseased. or attacked by insects, to promote the formation of healthy new wood. Old vines must often be heavily pruned for the same reason. Vines growing on rich, heavy soil will not bear as much pruning as those growing on light or sandy soil. The fruit is, as a rule, larger and later on heavily pruned vines. This is caused by an oversupply of sap. The more nearly upright a cane is the more sap will flow into Hence, the fruit is likely to be larger and later than the fruit on zontal canes on the same vine. 1'art.s of the Vine Defined A clear understanding of the different parts of the vine is neces - ary before the details of pruning and training can be satisfactorily considered. The trunk or stem is that part of the vine between the roots and the branches. A cane is a matured shoot one to two years old. A shoot is a green or new growth less than one year old. An arm is a matured cane two or more years old. A branch is the portion connecting the arms with the trunk or stem and is of mature wood, usually several years old. The terms branch and arm are more or less interchangeable. A sucker is a shoot which starts from the trunk or root below the ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY A water sprout or "Bull Cane" is a shoot which starts above the ground from wood older than one year. Laterals are the secondard shoots or shoots from shoots. A spur is a cane pruned to less than five buds, not counting the basal bud, which may produce a shoot in case the vine is too heavily pruned. Pruning and Training Young Vines The treatment of the vine during the first two or three years of its growth determines the returns to be obtained. It is often neces - sary, where the plants have been badly neglected, to start all over again with new vines. There is no other fruit among all our culti - vated varieties and kinds which will respond so readily, either bounti - fully or sparingly as the case may be, to the treatment received. Before planting, the roots of the young vine should be cut back 3 or 4 inches. All tangled and bruised or lacerated portions should be removed, and all cuts should be made smooth and clean. The top should be cut back to one cane, and only two or thret buds should be left on it. During the first season after planting, no pruning is necessary, except perhaps to remove all but two or three of the strongest shoots soon after growth starts. The next spring the vines should be pruned and staked growth starts. Again, all of the canes but one should be removed. Th ing cane should be shortened to three or four buds in weak or slow growing vines, but if a vigorous growth has been made and the wood well matured the cane may be cut back to the height at which it is desired to head the vine or to form arms. The cane should be tied securely to the stake in order to keep it straight and in an upright position until it can support itself. The stakes should be strong enough to bear the weight of the next season's growth without bending or breaking, and should be long enough to extend above where the vine is to be headed, after being driven into the ground 18 or 20 inches. Where the cane has been cut back to three or four buds, all the young shoots not needed to form the framework of the vine should be removed soon after growth starts. The remainder should be tied securely in the positions in which they are intended to grow. If the Kniffin, Munson, Caywood, or Umbrella system of training is used, only one new shoot should be left. It should be pinched back after attaining a height at which it is desired to head the vine, in order to force out branches. If the fan system is to be used, the shoots are pinched back closer to the ground to encourage branching. The de- </seg>
            <seg id="p229">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 229 sired number of branches may be secured from the buds left in prun - ing the young vine. The third spring, the vine should consist of the trunk or stem and the canes, which are to form the framework of the vine and from which the shoots for the first crop of grapes come. (Some grape* are usually borne the second season.) Pruning the third spring should be done more to secure the desired form of the vine than for fruit, since practically all of the new wood will be fruit bearing wood. Pruning Bearing Plants Pruning after the third year consists in removing all superfluous wood, all wood which is weakened by old age, by disease, or by in - sects, and in maintaining the amount, position, and vigor of fruiting wood by a proper system of renewal. The principles are essentially the same in all systems of training. The systems in use in the State at the present time are the fan and the two- and four-cane Kniffin, with modifications of each. There are many other systems in use in various parts of the United States, but since they are no better for this section of the country, they will not be considered. Whatever system is used, a certain amount of fruiting wood must be left each season and provisions made for furnishing new fruiting wood for the next season or for renewal. Renewal Renewal refers to the replacing of old wood by new which will ilfill the same purpose as the old. Renewal is necessary for several reasons. Unless renewal is practiced, the bearing part of the vine grows farther and farther away from the roots, and the bunches grow smaller and smaller each succeeding season until finally little or no fruit is produced. The different parts of the vine deteriorate with age, or may be destroyed by insects or disease. Some parts of the vine may require renewal after one year's service. Therefore, the successful vineyardist must be on the alert and replace old wood by new whenever necessary to maintain the health and vigor of his vines. Canes for fruit bearing must be renewed every season. Where any of the various spur systems of training are used, i. e., where the fruiting canes are cut back to five buds or less, the renewal is a simple matter, since the fruiting canes of the season before are cut back to a certain number of buds and thinned out until the required number of buds are left to each vine. The buds on these short spurs produce the shoots which will bear the fruit for the next season's crop and which must in turn be cut back, and so on with each succeeding sea - son's growth. </seg>
            <seg id="p230">230 This annual addition of spur growth of varying lengths causes the branches to become long and crooked. Hence, it often becomes necessary to renew the entire branch after a few years. This is done by selecting one of the most vigorous shoots which arises close to its base and cutting it back to a few buds, removing the branch in ques - tion entirely. Should it be desired to renew the entire arm it may be done by selecting a good, strong cp.ne growing from a bud near the base of the arm. The cane should be cut back to the desired length and tied in position after the arm has been removed. The first crop may be slightly below normal, but if a good cane is selected It should yield practically a full crop. Systems requiring long renewal canes make it much more dif - ficult to secure the proper wood. Such canes may be obtained from the buds at the base of the canes bearing the fruit the present season or from short spurs which have been left for that purpose. The latter method is the more desirable, since canes in the former case have usually borne fruit, and a considerable amount of old wood is left with the new so that Ihe bearing wood is soon too far away from the source of supply. Where the latter system is used, at least one spur is left for each bearing cane. These spurs produce shoots, which form the fruiting wood for the next season to replace the canes which are bearing fruit this season and which are removed in prunin The I an &gt;&gt; sit-in Vines trained to the fan system are renewed annually c the ground. From three to fine canes should be left each year and an equal or greater number of spurs. The canes are tied to the trellis in such a manner as to give the vine a fan-shaped appearance. This system has the following advantagi (1) The young shoots need little tyin (2) Tne vines can easily be l;iid down in case it is desired t cover them for winter. (3) Most of the old wood is removed each year However, this system has some disadvantages — the fruit is borne too low, and the foliage is so dense at the center of the plant that not enough light and air are admitted. This system is often so greatly modified that it is almost impossi - bl« to recognize it. Sometimes several different stems are allowed to grow and are headed between the wires. Sometimes the long re - newal and sometimes spurs are used for fruit bearing. </seg>

            <seg id="p233">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 233 The Four-Arm Kniltiii System According to this system two canes for fruit bearing and two spurs for renewal purposes are left at the first trellis wire about 30 inches from the ground. The same number of each are left at the top wire or about 55 to 60 inches above the ground. The canes are tied to the wires on either side of the vine, and the fruiting shoots are allowed to hang down. Many growers allow these canes to remain and form arms and branches from which the bearing wood is produced. In many cases a four-arm horizontal spur system is developed, but in the majority of cases there is a compromise, and both canes and spurs are used for fruit bearing. The long renewal Kniffln is especially adapted to strong growing varieties. Vines trained according to this system are easily and quick - ly pruned and do not require much attention during the growing season. If the spur system is allowed to creep in, more labor is re - quired in pruning, but the fruit is often more evenly distributed. Modifications of the two-arm Kniffln, Caywood, Munson, and Umbrella systems are used to a limited extent, but none of these sys - tems have proved satisfactory in this section, largely on account of birds which seek the shade and protection offered by the overhanging vines, while devouring the fruit. Fruiting Habits of Blackberries The different varieties of blackberries differ in their fruiting habits and therefore require different methods of pruning. Some of the best known varieties, such as Snyder, Early Harvest, Agawan, Early Cluster, Black Chief, etc., produce most of their fruit on branches from the main stem. Other varieties, such as Wilson and Ancient Briton, bear fruit within two or more buds of the main stem, and unbranched canes bear close to the ground; while others like the Taylor have five to ten buds next to the stem which do not bear fruit, and unbranched canes do not develop near the ground. It is vitally important that the pruner understand these differ - ences, for pruning is a thinning process, and the kind and amount of pruning must determine how much wood shall be left and how much fruit the plants are expected to produce. No one who knows would think of pruning the Snyder or the Taylor as heavily as the Wilson, or Ancient Briton, for he would be cutting away the greater part of the fruit. If the fruiting habit of the plant is not known, it Is well to delay the pruning until the fruit buds appear in order to determine how much wood to leave. </seg>
            <seg id="p234">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 234 Pruning Blackberries The first year the young plants are allowed to grow without prun - ing. The second season, however, the new canes which come up from the roots should be pinched or cut off as soon as they attain a height of 3 to 3 Vi feet. This will cause them to form branches which are necessary for the production of heavy crops, since few berries are borne on the main stem. Later, these lateral branches may be pinched back to cause the formation of sublaterals for the same purpose. After the crop has been removed, the old canes, or those which have borne fruit, should be cut out and burned, as their mission has been fulfilled and the space which they occupy is needed by the remaining canes. This also removes to some extent the source of insects and fungous troubles. Five to seven good, strong new canes should be left to fruit the next year and all the others removed with the old ones except where the canes are covered to prevent winter injury. Then more should be left to provide an extra supply, should any be damaged in covering. Another pruning should iven in the spring just after growth r diseased canes and the tips of all starts. At that time all broken canes and branches injured by r and burned. therwise shoulfl be removed Mark Cap and Piir|&gt;l&lt;' Cane Raspberries The fruiting habits of these berries are so similar to those of the blackberries that practically the same methods of pruning are adopted. The canes are usually pinched bark slightly closer to the ground than is the case with blackberries, and the laterals are rarely pinched back at all during the growing season, but cut back soon after growth staits in the spring. If the canes are cut back too heavily or too late during the growing season, the laterals are liable to b« poorly matured and to winterkill during the winter. During the early part of the season all suckers should be removed but not later than the first of June. Suckers for the next year's bearing canes should be selected and left, all others being cut out. Where planted in a continuous row, some form of support is often necessary to keep the canes in an upright position and from interfering with cultivation, picking, etc. A good plan is to set a line of posts at the proper height in the row and nail cross-arms, half - way up the posts and at the top. Near the outer ends of these arms, wires are stretched. The canes are kept between the double rows of wires, and the laterals are allowed to hang over and are supported by them. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 235 I&gt;ewberries and Other Viny Growers The vine producing berries, such as dewberries, loganberries, and evergreen blackberries, require a different method of pruning. Instead of pinching back the runners, four or five should be selected and enouraged to grow long and form as few laterals as possible. Late in the winter, the canes are cut back to one-half or two-thirds of their original length. These vine producing fruits do better if trained on a trellis of some sort. A trellis similar to the one used for raspberries is very satisfactory. The young growing canes are trained on the top wires while the fruit bearing canes are supported on the lower wires. Red Raspberries The red raspberries differ from the other raspberries and from blackberries in that the fruit is borne all up and down the main stem. Consequently, it is unnecessary to force laterals. Where laterals are produced by nipping back the canes, they usually succumb to our cold winters; and where the plants are covered, as it is almost always necessary to do here, the laterals are almost sure to be destroyed in the process of covering and uncovering. It is often necessary to prune back the ends of the canes in the spring just after growth starts, unless they are supported by trellises. Currants and Gooseberries The largest amount and the best fruit of the currants and goose - berries is produced on two- and three-year-old wood near the base of the shoots. Although older wood may bear as many berries, the size of the individual berry is much smaller, and it is best to remove wood more than four years old. The process of pruning these fruits is one of gradual renewal. Five to eight main stems should be allowed to develop. About one-quarter to one-third of the old wood should be removed each year and new wood be allowed to fill its place. The new shoots should be nipped back during the summer to induce branching. Disinfectants and Covers for Wounds Desirable disinfectants and covers for wounds are very important in pruning. The ravages of Illinois or blister canker during the past 10 years have especially emphasized the need of reliable disinfectants and covers for piuning and other wounds. Under present conditions, on account of the prevalence of disease, the two operations are neces - sary in dressing tree wounds. The wound must be sterilized to de - stroy any fungi or bacteria which may be present, and it must be </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY covered to prevent infection through the later entrance of fungous spores or bacteria. The sterilization of the wound may be accomplished by applying some antiseptic or germ killing material directly to the wounded surface by means of a brush or a small hand spray. The most satis - factory disinfectants are carbolineum, corrosive sublimate, or, carbolic acid, though gasoline, kerosene, copper sulphate solution, formalde - hyde, etc., may also be used. If the cover is applied immediately, the disinfectant may be mixed with it and one application be made to answer for both purposes. Where there is evidence of disease in the orchard, all pruning tools should be disinfected after finishing each tree, or after cutting through any diseased limb, by dipping them into some one of the before-mentioned materials or by swabbing (he tools off with a cloth or sponge saturated with a disinfectant. The cover must consist of such materials that the wound will not be allowed to dry out. They must be impervious to water and must exclude air. They must be adhesive and not be so affected by changes in temperature that they will crack or fall away from the wound. In order to secure a good covering, the material must be of such a con - sistency that it will spread easily and evenly. The materials must also be cheap enough not to be prohibitive. I'ainu. White lead and linseed oil, Venetian red and linseed oil, or chrome yellow and linseed oil make good coverings for small prun - ing wounds, but are useless for coverings for large wounds because they blister and peel off. Tars. Tars of various sources are often used as coverings for tree wounds. Coal tar, which is a by-product of coal oil refineries, con - tains gasoline or naphtha, or both. These may harm the tree by being absorbed, thus injuring the cambium. The writer doubts whether this supposed injury is serious enough to receive consideration. Tar has the advantage, on the other hand, of being cheap. Gas tar is the residue from the manufacture of gas. It is inex - pensive — a point in its favor — but it has the disadvantage of being almost entirely absorbed by the wood, and, like coal tar, contains volatile matter which may be injurious to plant growth. It may do some injury to the cambium of the trees. No injury, however, has been noted in our Station orchard. The greatest disadvantage has been that the tar being absorbed allows the wood to check, which is of course very undesirable. Pine tar is also absorbed by the wood and allows serious checking. </seg>
            <seg id="p237">PRUNING TREES, VINES AND SHRUBS 237 Asphaltum. Asphaltum is a by-product manufactured from the residuum in the distillation of western petroleum. According to the stage to which this distillation is carried on, the melting point will vary from 200* to 285' F. This is the only essential difference in the different grades. All the above grades must be heated before they can be applied. For this purpose a charcoal heater or a gasoline tinner's stove is very satisfactory to maintain the required temperature in the orchard, but the asphaltum must first be melted over a hotter fire. The hot asphaltum is applied by means of an old brush or swab and smoothed with a piece of hot iron either flat or curved according to the surface the wound. This solid asphaltum makes a good, cheap cover, but it is hard to apply on account of having to be heated. Then, there is some danger of cracking during the winter months where it is used on large wounds, unless carefully applied. If the work is well done it makes a very efficient cover. Liquid Asphaltum. Liquid asphaltum is solid asphaltum dissolved by mixing it while hot with some substance such as gasoline or naphtha, when it re - sembles coal tar very closely. There are, however, the same objec - tions advanced against its use as against coal tar. The use of vege - table oils as solvents has been recommended to overcome these objec - tions, but these oils make the product more expensive. Both forms of liquid asphaltum have been used at the Nebraska Experiment Sta - tion with good results. A solvent called Varmolene is offered for making liquid asphaltum. To make liquid asphaltum by using gasoline, naphtha, or Varmolene the asphaltum is melted, then withdrawn from the fire, and stirred while the solvent is added. The amount of solvent to use will depend upon the melting point of the asphaltum and the desired consistency of the mixture. For winter use where the asphaltum has a melting point of 285° F., 2% parts of oil may be used to 1 part of asphaltum. In summer the proportion should be about 2 to 1. Vegetable oils may be employed as solvents, in which case slightly less oil is used. When the solvents are added to hot asphaltum, there is some danger of explosion if near the fire. Liquid asphaltum has, as a rule, given better results than the solid. This is probably due to the fact that a better job of covering may do done. No ill effects have been noted from the use of any of the preparations of liquid asphaltum. </seg>

All diseased wood should be removed as soon as discovered, and the wound made by the operation should be disinfected and covered. No wood surfaces should be left exposed. Injuries from sun scald or cracks made in the bark by alternate freezing and thawing should be disinfected, and filled or covered with some plastic waterproof material that will help the tree to retain its sap, and that will prevent the entrance of insects and disease germs. Decaying stumps of limbs should be removed. The decayed wood which extends into the trunk should be taken out and the hole plugged with a block of wood or with Portland cement, after having first been thoroughly disinfected. The entire surface should then be covered. In treating hollows in the trunk or large limbs, all the decayed wood should be removed, the wound disinfected, and cavity filled, pre - ferably with cement. After these operations it is well to paint the whole surface. In the case of large cavities, it may be well to put in the cement in sections to prevent cracking by changes in temperat All prunings, decayed wood, bark, etc., should be removed f the neighborhood of the trees and be burned to prevent the scatt ing of diseases to adjacent trees These measures of sanitation apply equally u well to street and shade trees as to fruit trees Pruning Tools. It is impossible to prune satisfactorily without the proper tools. The kind and number of tools will vary, of course, with the kind and size of the plants to be pruned. However, every orchardist should have at least the following tools: A saw with a swivel blade should be used for pruning in close places where a broad bladed saw could not be used and for small limbs, and one 5-point solid blade saw should be used for removing large limbs. Saws with double cutting edges, should never be per - mitted in an orchard. More harm than good is done by employing such tools. A pair of pruning shears is a great help in pruning young trees and is absolutely necessary for pruning grapes, currants, goose berries, etc. </seg>

The blade should be heavy and wide with a ood hook on the end Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station WHY, WHKN, AXD HOW TO SI'HAY By J. Ralph Cooper The time has arrived when spraying must be considered as a part f the regular orchard work. Fruit growers can no longer secure, or xpect to secure, profitable returns from their orchards unless they practice thorough and systematic spraying. During the last three seasons an average of 72.5 per cent of the fruit in unsprayed orchards was so badly damaged by insects alone that it was fit only for vinegar. Fungous diseases have caused almost as much damage. Insects and fungi have caused a total loss in many orchards. The average loss due to both in the orchards under observation during the last three years was 86.6 per cent. During the seasons of 1913, 1914, and 1915, extensive tests were nade in orchards in various parts of the state to determine how much of this loss could be prevented by spraying, what materials to use, and how and when to apply them. It was found that practically all loss from either insects or fungi can be prevented by spraying, at an average cost of about 24 cents per tree for an ordinary mature tree. The average value of fruit in unsprayed orchards, determined by the price which the fruit actually brought on the market, was $1.67 per tree. The average value of fruit in the sprayed orchards was 8 per tree. After paying the cost of spraying, this left a net gain 4 7 per tree due to spraying. In order to control insect and fungous enemies it is necessary to understand their life history and habits. Much labor and money is often wasted in spraying at the wrong time. In spraying for chewing insects of any kind, the poison must be placed on the plants before or just as soon as the insects arrive. Hence, it is imperative that the orchardist know at what stage of its life cycle the insect feeds on the plants and at what season of the year the feeding stage occurs. If </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY spraying is done too long before the insects appear, the material may be washed off; but the insects may have burrowed out of reach of poison if it is not applied until after they have begun feeding. In spraying for fungous diseases the fungicide must be applied before the spores germinate. If the spores have germinated and parts of the new growth have entered the foliage or fruit, it is impossible to prevent fungous injury. SPRAYING FOK THE (OXTKOL OK INSECTS Codling .Moth This insect passes the winter as a larva, or woim. About tht time apple trees are in full bloom tnese worms begin pupating, 01 transforming themselves into moths. The moths emerge and begir laying eggs about three weeks after the petals have fallen from tht apple blossoms. The first or spring brood of worms hatch from tlu eggs within a very few days. Some of them go immediately to th( fruit while others feed a day or two on the leaves and then move tr the fruit. About 80 per cent of the worms enter the apples at th&lt; calyx end. The remaining 20 per cent enter the sides of the apple: where two fruits touch or where a leaf or twig touches the fruit. Th« worms live to maturity in the fruit, emerge, and transform to moths which in turn lay eggs for a second or summer br A Normally there are but two broods of worms in Nebraska, but the length of time necessary for eggs to hatch and for worms to grow to maturity and transform to moths depends upon the teniperaum and weather conditions. During hot, dry seasons much less time if required than during cool, moist weather. Hence, worms are much more abundant. The codling moth feeds only during the larval or worm stage. Hence, in order to prevent injury, spraying must be done just before the eggs hatch. But by the time the first-brood eggs begin to hatch, the calyces of the apples have all closed, and the worms which enter the apples at this point are safe from poison because the spray can - not be forced into the closed calyx cups. The calyx cups may be filled with poison if spraying is done immediately after the petals have fallen. After studying the life history of the insect it is very evident that three sprays are necessary to prevent damage to the fruit during a normal season, — one just after the petals have fallen; one three weeks later, just before the first-brood eggs begin hatching; and an - other just before the second-brood eggs begin to hatch. But during hot, dry seasons it may be necessary to spray four or even five times. </seg>
            <seg id="p243">WHY, WHEN AND HOW TO SPRAY 243 The efficiency of a spray schedule for the control of-codling moth depends very largely upon the thoroughness of the petal-fall applica - tion. However, this application is not in itself sufficient, even though every calyx receives a good dose of poison. Approximately 20 per cent of the first-brood "worms" normally enter the fruit at various points other than the calyx, on unsprayed trees. The spray materials lodged in the calyces certainly will cause some of the larvae which would otherwise enter the calyx to seek other points of entrance, to that the percentage of the larvae which enter the fruit from other points must be appreciably increased. This is borne out by the fact that even with the most thorough calyx spraying during the last three seasons 20 to 4 0 per cent of the worms were controlled by the late applications. The first application should be made immediately after two-thirds to three-fourths of the petals have fallen. The spray should be ap - plied as a coarse mist directly against the face of the open calyces. In order to apply the material properly the greater part of the spray - ing should be done from the tower. A good arrangement, where the trees are large, if a large capacity machine is used, is for two men to work from the tower and one from the ground. The material should be applied downward with a stroking motion of the rod, beginning at the extreme tips of the branches and following down to the trunk. In this way, there is a minimum danger of missing any of the calyces. More material is needed for this application than for any other. The pressure should be 225 to 250 pounds. The next spray should be applied about three weeks later and should consist of a fine mist. The main object of this application is to cover all growing parts of the tree thoroughly. The material should be directed both above and below with long stroking motions, begin - ning at the tips of the branches. The exact time for applying this spray is immediately after the moths begin to deposit their eggs. The correct time may be determined by collecting larvae early in the spring and keeping them confined until they pupate and emerge as moths. Repeat the operation for the second brood and if necessary, the third brood. By doing this and noting weather conditions, every orchardist should be able to spray so that he may secure the greatest efficiency from the materials used. The best materials will give, at best, poor results if used at the wrong time. The third (or second-brood) spray should be applied immediately after the eggs laid by the first brood have hatched. It should be ap - plied in the same manner as the preceding spray. In abnormal seasons like that of 1914, when, owing to favorable conditions, the moths emerge early and multiply rapidly, a third- </seg>

The I'lnin Curnilio The primary injury done by the curculio consists of small holes ride in the apples in feeding and for depositing eggs. This is only small part of the injury, however. These punctures cause the fruit to become ill-shaped and knotty, and admit fungi. The beetles or Therefore, control measures which suggested themselves anc which have proved effective are: the removal of trash and rubbish, accompanied by early spring cultivation; thorough spraying with arsenate of lead before the blossoms open, followed by the regular codling moth schedule; the removal of windfalls, which may contain larvae, from the orchard; and, last'y, thorough cultivation of the or- chard from the middle of July to the middle of August adults pass the winter under trash and rubbish, and come out and begin leeding on the new leaves before the blossoms open. As soon as the fruit sets they begin- feeding on it and depositing their eggs. Considering the following facts known in regard to the life his- tory of the plum curoulm, it is evident that by taking advantage of certain habits of the insect its control is comparatively easy and certain: (1) The adults hibernate during the winter under trash and rubbish in the orchard. (2 i After a winter of lasting they ;m- wry voracious and in the spring commence feeding on th. new loaves and buds before the blossoms are open. (3) The larvae are unable to live to maturity in the apples when they remain on the tree. Only those larva' which are in the apples that fall early reach maturity and become beetles. (1) The laivae begin entering the ground to form their pupal cases and transform into beetles about the middle of July. This con- tinues up to the middle of August or later. The pupal cases are placed at an average depth of one to two inches. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">WHY, WHEN AND HOW TO SPRAY 245 SPRAYING FOR THE CONTROL, OK FINUOIS DISEASES Apple Scab One of the determining factors in the production of apples in Nebraska is the prevalence of apple scab. Notwithstanding the fact that its destructiveness is well known and that reasonably sure methods control have been published, this disease alone damages more than 50 per cent of the fruit of the state. As a matter of fact, the loss is often even greater than it appears. The young apples drop premature - ly, due to the attacks of the fungus upon the flowers before and dur - ing the blossoming period, and on the young fruit later. This was especially noticeable during the seasons of 1913 and 1915. At blossom - ing time the bloom was as heavy on the unsprayed as on the sprayed trees. The set of fruit on the sprayed trees was much heavier than on the unsprayed trees, and the number of apples which dropped pre- iitiiroly much less. In unsprayed orchards the foliage is sometimes so severely injured that the fruit never attains salable size, and scarcely any growth is made by the trees. It often takes two or three years of thorough spraying to bring the trees back to normal growth and productiveness. Scab also impairs the keeping quality of fruit. At harvest time in 1915 several boxes of Winesap, Arkansas, and Ben Davis apples were stored. A part of each variety came from trees having considerable scabby fruit and a part from trees having no scab. All the fruit was free from visible scab when packed. Some of the fruit was placed in cold storage and some in cellar storage. When the fruit was examined in January, 1916, 10 per cent of the fruit in cold storage was scabby and 68 per cent of the fruit in cellar storage was scabby. The fruit in cold storage was held a few days re being stored and was taken out two days before being examined. Time of Infection — Apple scab is a cool weather disease and thrives best under conditions that allow shade and moisture. Under ordinary conditions the period of greatest infection is from the time the leaf buds begin to unfold until two or three weeks after the petals fall. Where there is an abundance of dead leaves under the trees the period of infection may be prolonged by the continued development of spores or seedlike bodies in the leaves during a long period of wet weather. During the cool, damp weather of 1915, there was a great deal of loss due to a second infection occurring from the latter part of July to the middle of August. To this late infection is attributed a large part of the loss in storage due to scab injury. The writer is of the opinion that infection occurred before picking, because clean fruit from a scab-free orchard developed no signs of scab, even though stored in the same package with heavily scabbed fruit in the same cellar where so much infection was found. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 246 Varietal Susceptibility — It has been found that none of the com - mon varieties are entirely free from scab, although many varieties exhibit a great deal of resistance. From the observations made in various orchards in the state and in the variety orchard at the Experiment Station the varieties have been tentatively grouped as follows: Practically Resistant — Wagner, Oldenburg (Duchess), Wealthy, Patten Greening. Moderately Kesistant — Jonathan, York (Imperial), Ben Davis, Windsor, Gano, Grimes (Golden), Missouri (Pippin), Salome, Cham - pion, M inkier. Northwest Greening, Rome (Beauty), Delicious, Red Astrachan, Wolf River, Malinda, Willow Twig, Stayman (Winesap), Chicago, Utter (Red). Susceptible — Arkansas (Mammoth Blacktwig), Rails (Genet), Northern Spy, Red June, Virginia Beauty, Yellow Transparent, Sheriff, Maiden Blush, Wa!bridge, Early Harvest, Fameuse (Snow), King David, Chenango, Paragon. Scab was always found to be more prevalent where no cultivation was practiced and decidedly less in evidence where thorough, early and late cultivation was practiced. Sanitation, that is, the removal of old leaves, windfalls, and mummied apples, together with clean culture, will go a long way to - wards controlling the scab infection. The proper spacing of the trees in an orchard, good air drainage, and the right amount of pruning will lessen the infection of scab to some extent. However, with an ideal orchard and the best methods of sanitation, clean fruit cannot be grown in Nebraska unless the orchards are properly sprayed. Spraying will control the disease if done at the proper time. This time depends upon the time of infection. The spray must be applied before the infection in order to prevent injury. Therefore, since there is always more or less infection at or just before the time the blossoms are out, if the weather conditions are favorable, it follows that spray - ing for scab must be done before this time. What is known as the cluster-bud stage — just as the flowers of the clusters are separating and showing "pink" but before the individual blossoms open — is the proper time for this application. A second application at the petal-fall stage and another two to three weeks later are as a rule required to insure protection. During this time new surfaces of fruit and fo'.iage are being rapidly exposed and are liable to infection. Another spray in the latter part of July or the first part of August may be necessary to prevent late infection in seasons such as that of 1915. </seg>

            <seg id="p249">WHY, WHEN AND HOW TO SPRAY 249 In order to secure the best results it is necessary that the grower watch the weather conditions carefully and regulate his schedule ac - cordingly. Thousands of bushels of apples have been lost in this state because the grower delayed spraying on account of rainy weather, fearing the spray would wash off. This is just the time when protec - tion is needed to prevent infection. There is rarely a season In Ne - braska when, because of wet weather, there is not sufficient time to spray; and if it is only possible to work for a part of a day at a time, spraying should proceed. Ordinarily the spray material will dry in 30 minutes of sunshine so that it will adhere well through any ordin - ary hard washing rain. Apple Blotch This fungus attacks fruit spurs, twigs, and rapidly growing shoots as well as the leaves and fruit. On the fruit spurs, twigs, and water sprouts, small cankers are formed in which the fungus lives over The fungus injures the leaves by killing the tissues in small ir - regular spots. These spots often appear in great numbers scattered over the surface of the leaf. Badly infected leaves turn yellow and drop prematurely, or die and remain on the tree. On the fruit, the disease first appears as a very small, light brown blot with very irregular fringed edges. The blotches spread rapidly, and often, where they are numerous, run together and cover almost the entire surface of the fruit. The fungus kills only the outer por - tion of the skin so that the continued growing of the fruit causes the fruit to crack. Infection — The cankers in which the fungus passes the winter are the chief sources of infection. Spores are produced during th« warm, moist weather of spring. They are rapidly carried by the rain and other agencies to the young fruit, leaves and twigs, producing the first spring outbreak of the disease. The most extensive infec - tion begins 4 to 5 weeks after the petals have fallen, although some infection probably occurs during the remainder of the growing season. Bordeaux mixture is superior to lime sulphur for controlling blotch. For this purpose the 3-4-50 (3 lbs. of bluestone, 4 lbs. of lime, and water to make 50 gallons) is recommended; though, if a good grade of fresh stonelime is used (not air-slaked or hydrated lime), the 3-3-50 formula is equally good. During dry weather the 4-4-50 formula has given good results but is not so safe when used during wet weather. Three weeks after the petals fall is soon enough for the first spray for blotch; and in orchards no more badly infected than 15 per cent to 45 per cent, this spray, followed by another application of fungicide when spraying for the second brood of codling moth, is </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 usually sufficient. In orchards more heavily infected, another appli - cation of Bordeaux mixture 15 to 20 days after the 3-weeks spray should be made. Ordinarily only such varieties as Mann, Missouri, Maiden Blush, Northwest Greening, and Ben Davis are seriously injured by blotch. IViliir I Ell si This disease has two stages. The first stage occurs not on the apple but on the foliage and twigs of cedar trees, where it appears during the fall and winter as small, brown knots commonly called Little cedar rust has been noted in Nebraska during the last few seasons owing, no doubt, to the extreme dry weather. However, the disease often proves very destructive. The disease may be controlled by destroying all cedar trees in the neighborhood of the orchard, but often the cedar trees are too valuable to sacrifice. A report published from this Station by Emerson in 1903 ( Bu 88) shows that the first or cluster-bud spray has comparatively n effect on the amount of injury and the one following give ■ v i ust, but that the petal-fall spray jh per cent of control.

The fungus attacks the fruit late in the season and works entirely on the surface. The discolora - tion reduces the salability of the fruit. The fungus is most abundant during wet seasons and does the most damage to fruit in the lower parts of the orchard where air drainage is poor, where the trees stand too close together, or where they are not properly pruned.

            <seg id="p251">WHY, WHEN AND HOW TO SPRAY 251 liordeaux Mixture vs. lAme Sulphur Bordeaux has long been considered as the standard fungicide, but it causes so much injury to both fruit and foliage of apple trees that it has been thought advisable to secure a substitute. The most seri - ous injury occurs when Bordeaux is used for the petal-fall or calyx spray. As the fruit grows older it is less liable to injury, though if the spraying is done during wet weather, or if wet weather follows soon after the spraying, some injury may occur even after the fruit is full grown. Very little injury, however, follows the use of Bordeaux for the last spray of the season and there is practically no injury when Bordeaux is used for the cluster-bud spray. Attempts have been made at the Station to prevent Bordeaux injury by adding an excess of lime to the mixture when spraying, or by spraying the trees with lime water after each rain, but no benefits were secured from either method. Lime sulphur has proved the most satisfactory substitute for Bordeaux. However, this material also causes some injury to fruit and foliage when spraying is done during extremely hot, dry weather. Lime sulphur has been found practically as effective as Bordeaux In controlling all of the ordinary fungous diseases except apple blotch. For the control of blotch, Bordeaux is much more effective. Because Bordeaux injury is greatest during wet weather and on young fruit and because lime sulphur injury is greatest during dry. hot weather, it is possible to interchange these two fungicides in the schedule so that practically no spray injury will result. Neither Bordeaux nor lime sulphur will produce russet on the fruit when used for the first or cluster-bud spray. Lime sulphur must be used for the calyx or petal-fall spray. Lime sulphur should be used for the 3-weeks spray except on varieties infected with blotch. Even if blotch is present lime sulphur should be used if wet weather prevails, but an application of Bordeaux should be made as soon as possible after the weather becomes clear and settled. If a fungicide is used for the fourth spray, it should be Bordeaux if the weather is extremely hot and dry, and lime sulphur if the weather is cool and damp. If only one fungicide is to be used through - out the season, it should be Hme sulphur. As a rule even where rus - seting is negligible, fruit sprayed with Bordeaux is not so bright colored and attractive as fruit sprayed with lime sulphur. It is the opinion of the writer that a great deal of the so-called spray injury to the leaves is due to infection by fungous diseases. It was noticed that during the last few seasons both Bordeaux and lime sulphur injury were as a rule more noticeable in orchards where there </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY was an infection of blotch or scab. The spray when applied where infection has already occurred finds a ready entrance into the leaves at the affected points and easily destroys the surrounding portions. Homc-lloilcri vs. Commercial Lime Sulphur A comparison of the efficiency of home-boiled and commercial lime sulphur was made in 1915. Although no definite conclusions could be drawn, the indications are that the home-boiled product when properly made is as effective as the commercial. Slightly less spray burn was found on the plats sprayed with the home-boiled material where only the clear liquid was used. Lime sulphur containing sludge causes more severe burning than where the clear liquid is used. This was demonstrated in a near-by - orchard where lime sulphur containing sludge was used on a part of the orchard while the remainder was sprayed with the clear liquid. Both leaves and fruit were damaged where the sludge was used. Grit or hard materials of any kind in the solution may cause russeting by being thrown against the surface of the fruit with considerable force, thus destroying liie waxy covering of the cells or the cells themselves and allowing them to be more easily injured by the corrosive action of the spray. Commercial Preparations Sold a* I iinuii ule* Several preparations, sold as fungicides by various companies, have been tried out, but so far nothing has been found to take the place of the two standard fungicides. Several brands of prepared Bordeaux were found to control fungous diseases practically as well as the regular Bordeaux but did considerable more damage to fruit and foliage. Atomic sulphur and soluble sulphur were used with the results that, while scab was usually controlled, the damage to fruit and foli - age was so great as to make the use of either disastrous. Sulphur in either form would be desirable because of convenience in handling and reduction in freight, could the disagreeable feature of injury to the fruit be eliminated.

Even for the petal-fall spray, nothing is gained by using the Bordeaux type of nozzles. Coarse mist nozzles operating under 225 to 250 pounds pres - sure will throw a penetrating heavy mist several feet through the foli- age of an ordinary tree and will fill the calyx cups as readily and cover all parts of the foliage more evenly and thoroughly than will the Bordeaux type of nozzle. i uinulative Klfet'ts of Spraying The argument is often advanced that it does not pay to spray when a crop is not expected, or when the insect infestation or the fungous infection is light. This is a fallacy. The orchardist cannot afford to neglect spraying just because there is no promise of im - mediate returns. Spraying will more than pay expenses in the benefit the following year's crop. At Florence in 1313, only a part of a acn&gt; orchard was sprayed. The whole orchard was sprayed in 1914 I:il5; but at harvest time in 1915 the effect of the thorough ying received by but a part of the trees in 1913 was still decided- loticeable. The effects were so evident that the packers, who were acquainted with the facts of the case, found a decided difference he grades of fruit from the two parts of the orchard. At Omaha one plat was chosen in an orchard which had been well ed for five years and one in an adjoining orchard which had r been sprayed. Neither plat was sprayed in 1915. In the first the 1915 crop showed 11.15 per cent insect injury and 33.12 per igous injury. The second plat showed 94.62 per cent insect nd every apple was injured by fungi. At Beatrice two plats were chosen, one of which was sprayed in 1 :&lt; 1 4 and one which had never been sprayed. Both were sprayed in 1915. The fruit from the first showed 5.75 per cent insect injury nd 22.84 per cent fungous injury. The fruit from the second showed LSI per cent insect injury and 57.32 per cent fungous injury. These data, whi'e not exhaustive, serve to indicate the import of continued effort in insect and disease control. Cost of Spraying The cost of spraying depends greatly upon the efficiency and capacity of the machine used. The capacity of the spray machine must be determined by the size of the orchard and the length of time available for applying the petal-fall spray. The time from the falling </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 of the petals to the complete closing of the calyces is usually seven to ten days. It is not safe to allow more than what can be sprayed in five or six full days for one machine. A barrel pump is efficient for orchards of 300 trees. During the three seasons the average cost of spraying with a barrel pump, in - cluding labor and material, was 30 cents per tree for four sprays. A double acting horizontal or duplex hand pump was found to be efficient for 300 to 4 00 trees. The average cost of spraying with this outfit was also about 30 cents per tree for four sprays. Gasoline-engine-driven pumps range from 3 gallons per minute to 12 gallons per minute in capacity, and are efficient for about 150 trees for each gallon per minute. This would be 450 trees for the smallest and 1,800 trees for the largest outfits. The average cost of spraying with power outfits during the past three seasons ranged from 20 to 25 cents per tree. Power machines are the most satisfactory where the orchard is large enough to warrant their use though not necessarily more effi - cient than a good type of hand pump outfit when the latter is properly used. With any outfit the nozzle capacity must be regulated to fit the capacity of the pump. No outfit will do good work when the pump is unable to supply the liquid fast enough to maintain a go&lt; pressure. It makes little difference whether a double acting horizont pump or an upright duplex or triplex pump is used if the capacity large enough and it is well made; provided that plenty of power supplied to operate it at full capacity, and that the outfit is not t&lt; h«avy. However excellent in all other ways, an outfit is not depen able unless it has a good pressure regulator. It must be remembered that efficiency in spraying is secured only by doing the work thoroughly and at a time that will prevent infesta - tion and infection. Protection by spraying is preventive rather than curative. A spray applied at the wrong time is little better than no spray. Spraying in a half-hearted way is often worse than no spray. It costs money but does no good. It is cheaper to buy an efficient machine than to "kill time tinkering" with a poor one. </seg>

One of our county agents, who has noticed this, was just talking to me about this very thing; said we ought to get together in some way by a called meeting, or in some meeting that is already called by the county agents, and make an effort to get a large number of farmers to look this seriously in the face and agree to plant at least a family orchard and care for it in a proper manner from the planting to packing, and have our county agents agree to have some one who knows how to care for them, to keep them posted. Even while growing, the land will support itself, and when in bearing show them it will be the most profitable land they have, and they will want to try it on a larger scale. At this pro - posed meeting have the very best equipped man or men to discuss the subject till these agents would get the fever, and in turn call meetings in their counties, of both women and men, to form an orchard party, or club of some kind, that would promote interest in the fruit industry in every portion of the state where it will prove a paying proposition, and we have men that know this, just as they used to know where Milksick was located (always just across the line). The only difference they always wanted to be out of it, and in this, all want to be in it. And most of the state will produce fruit of some kind, at least for family use, in the years the weather is favorable. If something is not done we will soon be without apples here and prices will be so high most of us will have to do without. Do you know that we have fifty county agents in the state who are anxious to do anything to help make two blades of grass grow where now only one grows. Under the extension service of the State University, be - sides the officers and supervisors and clerk, this is an army we must use to its capacity. Would it now be the proper thing for the county agents to call a meeting during the State Fair to consider this proposi - tion, or bring it up at some meeting, already called? Of course I can only suggest, but if you could see this thing as it Is, or as I see It, I am sure some action would be taken. The following are the names of the officers and county agents and addresses. If you are interested talk with them about It now: </seg>

            <seg id="p265">NEW AND OLD ORCHARDS 265 LEST YOU FORGET We want another word on the "New Orchard Drive I have been asked why I am so anxious about planting new orchards when probably I would never see them bear much fruit. This brought back to me the exact question I once asked my father (who was a great fruit man). He gave bushels away, and made It a rule never to let a year pass that he did not put out fruit until he was 82 years old. It was a hot day, and I was a tired boy. He an - swered me by pointing to our old orchard that was supplying us ao bountifully, and said, "If someone had not planted these trees years ago, would we have apples now?" That was enough, and I never forgot it. And from that day I have realized why new orchards should be planted every year. So when I see on every hand orchards pass - ing away, and so few seeming to realize it, I felt it a duty we owe, to call your attention to the grave importance of the subject. And I was really surprised to see how the subject took, and how many let - ters I received asking "What can we do?" etc. Especially the interest taken by the press. I did not realize that our little paper was read by some of these people. But if I could see reasonable results from this proposed drive that would encourage a start for good orchards under competent advice and once get them to the paying point and Mop to think that this planting is not like grain, but stands for years if cared for, and that a small orchard may be had in a corner that might be waste otherwise, then we will have commercial orchards planted by men that never thought of it before. And if this is accom - plished an apple tree would satisfy the marking of my resting place. Now, I seem to hear someone saying, "There he goes again; that secretary is daffy on this new orchard business." But since I hare heard it said that Prof. Howard's hobby is potatoes, and when we know what he has accomplished for the potato interest in western Nebraska, and made that portion that for years you would not take as a gift, now supp'ying us with as good potatoes as In any country, not only for the table, but for seed. This having been fully tested. It doesn't make much difference what we call him. His corps of workers will tell you that he is there with the poods (using a college phrase), and to know that at Rushville, where not long ago that coun - try was inhabited with Three C's, Cattle, Cowboys and Coyotes, they now have the second potato flour mill in the United States that will care for the culls and also manufacture potato chips. Is not this enough to inspire enthusiasm in the most skeptic? Now, begging pardon for these random thoughts that I might not be able to get before you only that there is no strings on our editor, and be says just what he thinks, and when the paper is out it is too late to call him down. So you are not to blame the society, as it Is his individual epistle without waiting the consent of any other country on earth. </seg>

In making our proposed drive, let us feel the pulse of everyone that has about 200 square feet of waste ground, or about an acre, who will want some apples a little later on when our orchards are a thing of the past. To buy apples will be almost prohibitive — only for millionaires. Then organize a group in every county, a community club, or some other such name, which will enlist enough members who will agree to plant even a smal! orchard and care for it in a proper manner. One specialist can oversee the group from planting to the market. Then we will have the right kind of fruit and get the best prices. Many homes have more than an acre of waste land in lawn that an orchard would beautify more than any other acre they have when in bearing, and for many years a shady grove if properly cared for. Remember, you don't have to plant an orchard every year, as with corn and small grain, but with little care each year it is good for you and your chi dren. But you hesitate because you see old snags of trees, thick with brush, that has never seen a pruning kn or felt a spray.

You have started a badly neglected movement and we know much good will be accomplished as soon as the word reaches the farmer. The farmer who has neglected his orchard and now views the stumps realizes that he made a serious mistake in failing to provide for the planting of a new one before the old one had disappeared. We are glad to note that some of the state papers have men - tioned the movement you have started, and trust that the farm Journals will take hold of the matter and present it to their subscribers. The purpose of the farm papers, as I understand it, is to give assistance to the farmer in the way of information that will aid him in building up home surroundings that will be a credit to the community in which he lives, to grow a better grade of grain, and to improve the quality of his herd. Information concerning orchard growing is just as im - portant as the lines I have just mentioned, and should be given the same attention by the farm journals.

L"Keep the home orchards growing" would be the title of a popular g if the Nebraska Horticultural Society had its way. It is start - ing a campaign to induce people to renovate their old home orchards or to plant new ones. We have long been thoroughly convinced that commercial apple growing is a business requiring special training and experience and that the livestock farmer or the grain farmer better leave the com - mercial orchard to the man who is willing to devote his entire time to it. Commercial orcharding can and is being profitably carried on in territories on both sides of the Missouri river to a considerable dis - tance both above and below Omaha. We predict that in the future many more commercial orchards will appear in this territory. We are also firmly convinced that the average farmer should have a home orchard in which he has a selection of a few fruit trees of all kinds coming into bearing at different seasons. Fruit is necessary in every diet. It is not only necessary, but it is tremendously pleasing to the palate and therefore adds greatly to the enjoyment of life. The farmer, no matter what his type of farming, usually eats what he grows. If he does not grow the fruit, he will probably not have it. Since he can grow it so easily, and with so little care, there is no reason why every farmer should not have a small home orchard. The pocketbook will be fuller, the health of the family better and disposi - tions happier. — Nebraska Farmer. FIRST LETTER RECEIVED AFTER EDITORIAL CAME OIT, "NEW AND OLD ORCHARDS A SERIOUS QUESTION B. R. B. Weber, Sec., State Horticultural Society, Lincoln, Nebr. My Dear Mr. Weber: I am convinced that the concerted efforts on the part of your department, the horticultural department of the University Farm, the four papers in this state and the extension department, along the lines of increased fruit production would result in a large number of or - chards being planted next spring. I suggested to Prof. Howard, day before yesterday, when I met him on the street, that it would be a splendid thing for his department and your department to get together and call a meeting of the farm paper editors. Prof. Gunnels and Holland, and as many others as you feel ought to be called into such a meeting. I believe arrangements could be made for a strong campaign and I assure you my heartiest co-operation in any way you can use it. With best wishes, I am, OAK E. DAVIS, Editor. </seg>
            <seg id="p269">269 COMMON PESTS QUESTIONS There has been so many questions asked about the most common nsecis and their control that I have asked Prof. Bruner to give us a t article on a few of the most common pests, and how to handle &gt;i. I did not expect so busy a man to give us so much as he has. jut I know we voice the whole society when we tender him a vote •f thanks. Mr. B. R. B. Weber, iecretary State Horticultural Society, City. Dear Sir I have your favor of the 2 7th instant regarding certain common destructive insects and methods of fighting the same. I am accord - ingly enclosing, herewith, a brief paper on the subject, which may be some use to you in your horticultural journal. This paper might entitled "Injurious Insects and Remedies." At this time of year nearly every kind of plant — herb, bush, vine, or tree, is attacked by one or more kinds of harmful insects. It la natural, then, that information is wanted as to what these insects are and how they may be controlled. Generally speaking, insects that attack plants are of two kinds, viz., those that have jaws or biting mouth parts, and those that have sucking mouths. The first kind bite off and chew their food. The second kind suck sap or the juices of plants. Many of the biting and chewing insects (beetles, cater - pillars, slugs, etc. ) may be destroyed by spraying their food plants with poisons like arsenate of lead, arsenite of zinc and Paris green, mixed with water in such proportions as not to injure the foliage, but at the same time strong enough to kill the insects. The sucking in - sects (plant lice, leaf hoppers, scale insects and certain bugs) must be destroyed with contact sprays, as kerosene emulsion, tobacco or otine solution, strong soap suds and similar caustic substances. Many insects when working on a small scale, as in gardens and flower beds, may be destroyed by "hand picking." Even potato bugs and cutworms may be handled in this way. Many of our early spring insects live over winter in the larval stage, i.e., as cut-worms, wire-worms, grub-worms, maggots, etc. They begin feeding during the first warm days of spring. These insects hibernate among and under old grass, weeds and other rubbish that litters the ground, and crawl out to attack the early garden plants, weeds and bushes. It is then that they are most destructive, because of the comparative scarcity of green food. Later on in the year there may be many times the number of insects present, but since food has also become very plentiful the harm done by these insects is scarcely noticed. </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 Various insects differ among themselves in their methods of life, and, when we expect to fight them intelligently, we should learn to know something about them and their ways. In fact, each kind of our very many insects has special habits of its own that are just as different one from the other as are the habits of dogs, cats, cows, horses, hogs and sheep. Some of the common orchard insects are borers, coddling moth, tent caterpillars, scale insects or bark lice, aphids, leaf and tree hop - pers, climbing cutworms, but moths, flea beetles, etc. Garden insects are cutworms, gooseberry and currant slugs, flea beetles, and various kinds of plant lice. All insects have their natural enemies that hold them in check. These are predaceous and parasitic insects, reptiles, birds and other animal forms, as well as certain fungous growths and contagious dis - eases. Sometimes these natural checks tail to control and then man must take a hand to try to reduce the pest to a point where the natural check can take up the good work. It should be borne in mind that clean cultivation is always a remedy for harm from both common weeds and insects. In some cases it is the only precaution necessary to follow. In other cases it is part of the fight. If you are in doubt about the best method for controlling an in - jurious insect, write to the State Entomologist, care of the University Farm, Lincoln, and state your troubles. To be sure that the Entomo - logist will know the insect under consideration it might be well for the person who is looking for information to enclose specimens along with samples of their work. The above brief resume of insects has been dictated piecemeal and possibly will work out better if the paragraphs were somewhat transposed. You can do this to suit yourself and add to or cut out anything that you may think necessary to make the article more Yours very truly LAWRENCE BRINK I </seg>

This is the first time that the etary nl Agriculture of the United States has had the privilege of ting the representative? of the State Departments of Agriculture lively body. It is a late beginning. I trust that it will ot be a bad beginning and that it will become at least an annual ustoni. It is certainly highly pi oper that the administrative officer presenting the Nation in respect to agriculture should, from time time, meet and confer with the State agricultural administrative of- ils, for they have many diineult and important problems of com - n concern to deal with and should be able to be mutually helpful. I am not able to explain why your Association was not formed ■e it was; why it should not have been functioning effectively L- before tins; and why I have not heretofore had the satisfaction taking part in its proceedings. I can only Fay that I wish it had ible to have such meetings as this at least each of the last years.

Co - operation is not by any means perfect between State and Federal of - ficers, or between officers of one State or Federal department and those of another, or even between officers in the same department. There are many causes for this. Some are real; others are imaginary. Most men who are worth while become very much interested in their task. They are inclined to magnify it, to expand it, thinking that by so do - ing they will serve the public. Not infrequently they soon find them - sel'vs charged with invading the province of another enthusiast, and friction is set up. Others are selfish. There is unquestionably a great hem.

Co-operation is not easy with men who have much energy but n&lt; sense of direction, no honesty of purpose, and no spirit of public serv - ice. It is peculiaily difficult with the men who have much energy but no sense of direction. They are like the beetle. They mistake energy for efficiency. Doubtless each of you knows such men. I do.

I recall very vividly the difficulties we had at the outset in combating the gravest animal disease that has appeared in this country, namely, the foot-and-mouth disease. It was necessary that action should be prompt and effective, and yet in some of the States it was difflcu t to discover the authority possessing either funds or adequate power to make co-operation prompt and effective Department of Agriculture Co-operates With Numerous State Agencies. I have recently reviewed the co-operative relations of the Depart - ment of Agriculture with State agencies. The results reveal no little tion who have been pestering the Nation for some years. It is all a matter of intelligence, of right attitude, and of that understanding which conies from contact and conference. I hope it will prevail more and more perfectly between your Association and its members and the Department of Agriculture; prevail more and nior* throughout the Union; and even among the peoples of the whol&lt; world. It has become a habit to me to co-operate with State &lt;&gt;lli&lt;-ei&gt;. Bott formally, under terms of law, and informally the Department co- operates with a number of State agencies. Under the Smith-Level law, it co-operates with the agricultural college in each State in tht Union, and under the Federal Aid Road Act. with each BUkta highwa&gt; commission. The principle established by these laws is \ery beneficent and suggestive. It results in placing the officers of the two airencie.- serving the people in close and effective contact, securing unity of plar and action. It results in the elimination of waste and duplication o! effort and provides suggestively for a way out of the diftiru I double jurisdiction. But in many other matters difficulties m the way of co-opei at 101 arise, especially because of the dispersion of powers affecting ugricul ture in many of the States, because in some of them the line of d&lt;* marcation between the powers of State agencies has not been drawn and because even in some States where there are State commissioner! </seg>

Through the Federal Horticultural Board the Department co-operates with the plant inspection service in nearly every State of the Union and with boards of agriculture in five States in the control of the gipsy and brown tail moth; through the Biological Survey, with 41 States, either through fish and game com - missions or game wardens. State sanitary boards, conservation com - missions, or special societies, in the enforcement of the migratory bird law, the Lacey Act, and the destruction of predatory animals; through Farm Management, in 11 States with the departments of agriculture. and in nearly all the States with councils of national defense in the mobilization of labor; through Soils, in 11 States with State geological bureaus, and in 4 with State colleges or universities in soil survey work; through Chemistry, with all the States in the enforcement of the Food and Diugs Act, in some of them dealing with five or six agencies, as in Kansas, for instance, with the State board of health. the chief of the food and drug division, the University of Kansas, the State dairy commission, the director of experiment stations, and the State chemist; through Animal Industry, in a third of the States with State boards of agriculture, and in many more with State sanitary agencies of one sort or another in the control or eradication of the cattle tick, hog cholera, tuberculosis, and other animal diseases; through the Bureau of Markets, with market agencies in a number of States; through the Bureau of Entomology, with State entomologists; and through Plant Industry, in 11 States with boards of agriculture in the control of such plant diseases as the citrus canker, white pine blister rust, and in the eradication of the barberry plant, and in many more States with special agencies, such as plant boards, land agents, conservation commissions, forestry commissions, and State entomolo - gists, State economic zoologists, and State inspectors of nurseries. Need of a Strong Department of Agriculture in Each State, The matter of securing a great effective department of agriculture in each State of the Union, of giving it adequate power over appro - priate matters, and of drawing a reasonable line of demarcation be - tween its powers and those of any other State establishment, has been forced before my mind by the difficulties I have encountered in ad - ministering the Federal Department and has been in the forefront of my thinking since I have been in Washington. It is singular, when we come to think of it, that some States in existence for many years have proceeded without strong State administrative bodies dealing with agriculture having the requisite powers and sufficient funds. Certainly agriculture is one of the things which the States of the Union can afford with the greatest propriety to foster and to develop through the best possible organization. It would appear from the records in the early days of the Union that even such men as Hamilton considered agriculture as the field for the exclusive attention of State </seg>
            <seg id="p276">276 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY governments. In one of the papers in the Federalist, in advocating the adoption of the Constitution and in attempting to allay the fear of those who thought the instrument provided for an unduly centralized government, he asserted that there was no jurisdiction for apprehen - sion, since it created a government which would deal mainly with foreign affairs, finance, justice, and national military matters. As to the great field of domestic interest, such as agriculture, he asserted no one would entertain the thought that the Federal Government would occupy it. It would be a flfM lor occupation rather by the State governments. No one would question today the. desirability of a great Federal agency to deal with appropriate agricultural and related matters, but equally no one should question the high desirability of the most ef - fective possible State department to supervise and foster agriculture.

If this is the plan of the two bodies, I shall be very glad in all appropriate ways to give it such support as I can and to aid in securing its acceptance in any State where action may be needed. I know that there will be difficulties and that the problem will have to be dealt with in each State in the light of local conditions. It may be that no given plan would be feasible for every State; but I take the liberty of suggesting, for your consideration, the desirability of developing and presenting a tentative model law. financial Co-operation. In respect to financial co-operation with State departments, I am not at present aware that there is likely to be any departure in prin - ciple from that which already obtains. I suspect that the Congress will continue to make available appropriations to the Department of Agriculture for the necessary work in reference to all regulatory activities, and that it would be neither appropriate nor desirable for the Federal Government to make available to the States directly any funds for the support of their regulatory and administrative agencies. It may be that provision may be made on principles similar to those in the Federal Aid Road Act for other worthy enterprises; but, if this precedent is followed, appropriations will be made to the Federal De - partment to be used in co-operation with State agencies and State funds for appropriate purposes. It is interesting to note that only recently a bill has been intro - duced providing for co-operative action on the part of the Federal and State governments in the matter of rural health. I know of no more urgent need than that which would be met by this bill, and I urgently hope that it will receive prompt and favorable consideration. Better Co-ordination of State Agencies. It would be rash to say that there may not be similar undertak - ings in other fields; and it is clear that a better co-ordination of the agencies of the several States would facilitate such action and render the prospect of satisfactory results more certain. This is the last great step that needs to be taken to complete the organization of the gov - ernmental agencies. State and Federal, dealing with agriculture. I regard it as of the utmost importance that it be taken as quickly and as fully as possible, and I wish you speedy success in your efforts and in all your well-considered worthy plans and purposes.

There are victories of peace to be won no less important than those of war, and it is now incumbent on us to reveal the same spirit of patriotism and unity in winning daily the victories of peace and in securing to every individual, whether in the city or in the country, the fullest opportunity for his self-development and for the expansion of his capacities in the highest degree, without which equality of opportunity is, in a measure, a mean - ingless phrase. On behali of the Federal Government, I desire to thank you for the firm support you gave to all its purposes and to its plaus for win - ning the war. I am deeply grateful to you especially for the assistance you r.uve to the Department of Agriculture. In every direction at all times you co-operated with it in its efforts to secure an increased pro - duction and a fuller conservation and better distribution of food. I am aware also that in every possible way on your own initiative you omitted nothing which would strengthen the Nation and aid it in its grim task. I shall look forward confidently with great pleasure to a fuller and more effective combination of effort from this time forward KIXES AM) KK&lt;;i I.ATIONS OK THE SK«KKTAKY (&gt;!•' AtMtll I L- Tl'KK DIMB THK KOOD I'ltODKTS IXSI»K&lt;T1O\ LAW.

            <seg id="p289">THE RAILROAD PROBLEM 289 THE RAILROAD PROBLEM The question of railroad legislation is of such vital importance to the country that I take the liberty of submitting to you my views as to the course that should now be pursued. The war is ended and we are now confronted with the necessity either of legislating intelli - gently about the railroad problem at this session of the Congress or of promptly returning the railroads to their owners. Less than three months of the present session of the Congress re - main. It will be impossible, I presume, to secure legislation in this short period providing a permanent solution of the railroad problem. This being true, only three courses are open: (1) Government opera - tion of the railroads for one year and nine months following a procla - mation of peace, which would mean, in my judgment, Government operation for a period in no event longer than two years and three months; (2) the prompt return of the railroads to private control; or xtension of the period of Federal control to five years. I am convinced that it is wholly impracticable, as well as opposed to the public interest, to attempt to operate the railroads under the provisions of the present law. In the first place, the time is too short, and, secondly, the present legislation is inadequate. As to the shortness of time, it is clear to me that the railroads annot be successfully operated under Federal control during the next in the face of an automatic transfer to private control at tw- 1 of that time or of an earlier relinquishment by proclamation President. Every month that passes will bring more clearly to is of the officers and employees the fundamental change in is impending, and the question as to what that ns to the individual. It is against human nature that the e a be complete and single-minded attention to duty under such p.lt circumstances. This will be especially true on account of vitable discussion as to what ought to be done. Already this d cussion is in full swing and its reaction on officers and employe* cannot be consistent with the complete concentration upon their dailj duties. State Railroad Commissions, railroad security holders, rail - road executives, shippers organizations and other interests are natural - ly and properly discussing the subject and proposing various solutions. However desirable the discussion is for the crystallization of public sentiment, it cannot result otherwise than to produce a state of un - certainty and ferment among the vast army of railroad officers and employees who will inevitably feel that they face a rapidly approach - ing change in management. No business in the United States so imperatively requires disci - plined organization and composed conditions of operation, for officials as well as for employees, as the railroad business. Not only does the </seg>
            <seg id="p290">290 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY safety of the lives of millions of passengers depend upon such disci - plined and efficient organization, but the commerce of the country as well. To keep this vast army of officers and employees in a state of uncertainty and ferment for a period of two years would be harmful in the highest degree to the public interest. It would be impossible to prevent a serious impairment of the morale of the railroad organi - sations. From the standpoint of needed improvements, the period of two years is entirely too short a time within which to plan and carry out the comprehensive improvements which ought to be made to meet the country's requirements under peace conditions. Many of the improve - ments could hardly be completed and put into operation inside of the two-year period, and under such circumstances and facing a change to private management at the end of two years, it would be unwise in the highest degree to make the improvements and impossible to secure the hearty co-operation of the railroad corporations. Because of the inadequacy of the present legislation, the author - ity of the States and the Federal Government has been left in doubt by provisions which I opposed when the bill was under discussion. Conflict between State and Federal jurisdictions will grow more acute under this law. The revolving fund appropriated by the Congress will be insufficient to carry the Federal operation for a two-year period. More than that, it is of the utmost importance to the commerce, in - dustry, and life of the American people that a comprehensive program of improvements to railroad properties shall be carried forward over a period of at least five years; such a program will involve expendi - tures of at least J500.000.000 per annum or J2, 500, 000, 000 for the five-year period. The needed funds are not provided by the present law. Moreover, it is difficult under the present law, without the con - sent of the corporations, to carry forward a comprehensive plan of joint improvements, which, to be of value to the public, must of itself disregard the selfish and irreconcilable competitive interests of the various carriers. Many terminal improvements, to be genuinely serv - iceable to the public, must be made without regard to the interest of any particular carrier. Therefore, agreements between the Govern - ment and the railroads affected will, in many instances, be impossible, and if the Government should proceed with such improvements, using the people's money for the purpose, without securing the carriers' consent, litigation would undoubtedly arise upon the termination of Federal control with the danger that a large part of the Government's investment in the properties might be lost. Upon the efficiency of the transportation machine in America de - pends in great measure the future prosperity of the Nation. Involved in this prosperity is the extension of our foreign trade. We produce so much more than we consume that markets must be found for that </seg>
            <seg id="p291">THE RAILROAD PROBLEM 291 surplus. Those markets are the competitive markets of the world. We must be able to enter them upon equal terms with any other na'tion. Our transportation system, both on land and water, must therefore function at the highest point of efficiency and at the lowest possible cost, if we are to get our reasonable and fair share of the world's trade and in turn be able to keep a prosperous, contented, and happy popula - tion at home. To attempt to continue Federal control under the inadequate provisions of the present Federal control act and for the very brief period it authorizes, would be to multiply our difficulties and invite failure. On the other hand, I am convinced from the experience of the past year, that Mm return of the railroads to the old competitive condi - tions will be hurtful alike to the public interest and to the railroads themselves. This course, however, will bring fewer evils in its train than the unsatisfactory, if not impotent, Federal control provided for by the present act. The railroads were taken over as a war measure. They have been operated during the past year for the paramount pur - pose of winning the war. I think it will be generally admitted that the war service has been successfully rendered, and I am sure that experience of great value and benefit has been gained not only for the public but for the railroads themselves during this brief test. There is one, and to my mind only one, practicable and wise alter - native, and that is to extend the period of Federal control from the one year and nine months provided by the present law to five years, or until the first day of January, 1924. This extension would take the railroad question out of politics for a reasonable period. It would give composure to railroad officers and employees. It would admit of the preparation and carrying out of a comprehensive program of im - provements of the railroads and their terminal facilities which would immensely increase the efficiency of the transportation machine. It would put back of the railroads the credit of the United States during the five-year period so that the financing of these improvements could be successfully carried out. It would offer the necessary opportunity un - der proper conditions to test the value of unified control, and the ex - perience thus gained would of itself indicate the permanent solution of the railroad problem. The American people have a right to this test. They should not be denied it. It is to their interest that it should be done. In my opinion, it is the only practicable and reasonable method of determin - ing the right solution of this grave economic problem. I am not now and have not been for the past year interested in proving or disproving the theory of Government ownership or any other kind of theory. The railroads have been operated for the past year with the purpose of serving efficiently the paramount needs of the war and at the same time furnishing the best possible service to the </seg>
            <seg id="p292">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 292 public, whether such operation tended to prove or to disprove any theory of railroad control, no matter what it might be. I have formed no opinion myself as to what is the best disposition of the railroad problem because the test has not been sufficient to prove conclusively the right solution of the problem. I believe that a five-year test will give the American people the right answer. An ounce of experience is worth a ton of theory and with the start already made under war conditions, it would be a comparatively simple matter to complete the test so well begun and thereby gain the invaluable experience which will determine the solution of a problem which has vexed our State and National politics and our economic development for the past gen - eration. There are those who may say that an extension of five years for such a test will mean Government ownership. Personally I do not believe it. But whether such a test would indicate that the ultimate solution shall be Government ownership or a modified form of private ownership under effective Federal regulation, should not cause us to hesitate or refuse to act. It seems to m that in a democracy like ours, where public opinion and the judgment of the majority must finally control, the plain duty is to take those steps which will fully inform public opinion, so that the judgment may be based upon knowl rather than upon theory. Any test which will illumine the subje&lt; completely that public opinion may operate upon it intelligently w seem to me to be desirable in any circumstan In this connection, may I draw your attention made before the Committee of the Senate on January 5 reply to a Senator who asked if I t ved "in t ship of railroads," I said: "I do not, or I have not, at least, felt that it sary to take the actual ownership of the railroad? that it will b" impossible after the return of peac&lt; the competitive conditions to the same ex they prior to the outbreak of the war. I favor ernmental regulation and control of a far i telligent and effective character than we have had heretofore, because I am satisfied that a stronger Government control will be demanded and will have to be worked out, both in the in - terest of the public and in the interest of the security-holders of these railroads." Those who may oppose an extension of five years should face the situation squarely and acknowledge that they prefer the immediate return of the railroads to private control under the old conditions with - out remedial legislation. It is idle to talk of a return to private con - trol under legislation which will cure the defects of the existing laws. There Is neither time nor opportunity for such legislation at present. </seg>
            <seg id="p293">THE RAILROAD PROBLEM 293 It is impossible and hopeless for the Government to attempt the opera - tion of the railroads for twenty-one months after peace under the present law. Therefore, the country should squarely face the condi - tions that the railroads must promptly go back into private control with all existing legal difficulties unless the only practical alternative, viz.. an extension of time, is promptly granted. I hope that the Congress in its wisdom will grant a five-year period for a test of unified railroad operation under proper provisions of law which will make that test effective and at the same time take the railroad question out of politics while the test is being made. Un - less this is done, I do not hesitate to say the railroads should be re - turned to private ownership at the earliest possible moment. The President has given me permission to say that this conclusion accords with his own view of the matter. SOLDI KR INSURANCE Approximately four million officers and men of the Army and Navy are now insured with the United States Government for a grand tal of almost thirty-seven billion dollars. You owe it to yourself and to your family to hold on to Uncle aam's insurance. It is the strongest, safest, and cheapest life insur - ance ever written. For your protection Uncle Sam has established the greatest life insurance company in the world — a company as mighty, as generous, and as democratic as the United States Government itself. Just as Uncle Sam protected you and your loved ones during the war, so he stands ready to continue this protection through the days of readjust - ment and peace. The privilege of continuing your Government insurance is a valu - able right given to you as part of the compensation for your heroic and triumphant services. If you permit the insurance to lapse, you lose that right, and you will never be able to regain it. But if you keep up your present insurance — by the regular payment of premiums — you will be able to change it into a standard Government policy without medical examination. Meantime you can keep up your pres - ent insurance at substantially the same low rate. The Government will write ordinary life insurance, twenty-payment life, endowment maturing at age 62, and other usual forms of insurance. This will be Government insurance — at Government rates. The United States Government — through the Bureau of War Risk Insurance of the Treasury Department — will safeguard you and your loved ones with the spirit and purpose of a Republic grateful to its </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Eant defenders. To avail yourself of this protection, you must keep your present insurance.

Y APHIS ON HOOTS Carbon Disulphid Found Successful in Combating This Serious Pesl Carbon disulphid, in solution at the rate of one-half ounce to four gallons of water and applied at the rate of three-fourths gallon per square foot of soil, will control the root form of the woolly apple aphis and without injury to the trees under suitable conditions, says the U. S. Department of Agriculture, in Bulletin 730, recently pub - lished. The solution is prepared by pouring the carbon disulphid into the water and agitating the mixture vigorously. When applied on the soil around a tree the liquid penetrates into the ground and the poison gas given off by the chemical kills the pest. Every square foot of infested soil should be subjected to the action of the solution in order to insure complete control. This may be accomplished by pour - ing the liquid in a shallow basin made in the soil around the tree. In orchard practice where many trees are to be treated the solu - tion is best applied by using a power spraying outfit and two auxiliary tanks. The advantages of this method, according to the bulletin, are, the even diffusion of the liquid and complete aphid mortality in the </seg>
            <seg id="p295">THE FEDERAL LAND BANK STATEMENT 295 Y soil area treated and the safety with which the disulphid can b« used. The disadvantages of the method are: the huge amounts of water 1, witli consequent high cost of labor; the difficulty on any but -ound of preparing basins with level floors, thus insuring the oper distribution of the liquid over the area to be treated; and the ted roots on older trees, every square foot of which ■ treated with the liquid. This last condition precludes the bon disulphid except on small trees with restricted root areas. 1 1 11 in cyanid, kerosene emulsion and deep planting of trees Measures of control investigated, but they are not recom - he department.
