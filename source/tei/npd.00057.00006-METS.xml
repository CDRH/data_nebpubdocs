            <seg id="p002"/>
            <seg id="p003">FOREWORD To His Excellency, the Governor : The Board of Control herewith transmits the Fifth Biennial Report of the State Institutions of Nebraska for the period ending June 30, 1923. The biennium formerly ended on November 30 of each even-numbered year, but this date was changed by an act of the legislature, so that this report really covers a period of thirty-one months from December 1, 1920, to June 30, 1923. During the period, no change has occurred in the personnel of the Board, but several changes have been made in the chief officers of institutions. Dr. Beverly A. Finkle, superintendent of the Orthopedic Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska, resigned to enter private practice, and was succeeded on August 23, 1921, by Dr. J. H. Matthai. Miss Amy V. Stevens, who had been superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln, Nebraska, for a number of years, resigned on July 5, 1922, being succeeded by her sister, Miss Nellie Stevens. The latter served until February 19, 1923, when her resignation was received, and Miss Lena Driever was appointed to the position. We call attention with pride and pleasure to the fact that the report shows the institutions to have gone through the bien - nium without incurring any deficiencies ; although the cost of living, and consequently the cost of supporting the state's depen - dents, has certainly not decreased since the appropriations were made for the biennium. Some improvements of a permament character have been made at the various institutions during the period covered by this report. A hospital building, bakery and scullery have been erected at the Nebraska Institution for Feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebraska ; a cottage for girls at the Girls' Training School, Geneva, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Burkett, </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska ; a gymnasium building at the State Industrial School, Kearney, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, Nebraska ; a farm house and a barn at the Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a warehouse at the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford, Nebraska ; a kitchen building at the Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk, Nebraska ; a main building at the State Reformatory for Women, York, Nebraska. These buildings were badly needed, and they will have to be followed by others in the very near future if our wards are to be properly, efficiently and economically cared for. The legislature just past made provision for two or three buildings, but failed to see the necessity for several others that were urgently requested. Brief mention was made in the last report of the establishment of the Reformatory for Men at Lincoln, but the importance of the institution calls, we believe, for rather more extended notice. This institution was established as a result, primarily, of a wide recognition of the need of segregating young first-term offenders from more mature criminals. The legislature of 1921 authorized the establishment, therefore, of such an institution, making an initial approproation of $300,000. Of this sum the Board ex - pended $37,500 for 10 acres and a brick building known as the Hayward Military Academy, later buying about 152 acres of contiguous land for the sum of $49,531.25. This land is used for farming, stock raising, dairying, and intensive gardening. Various trades are taught such as tailoring, shoe repairing, carpentry and joinery, brick laying, electricity, automobile repairing, launder - ing, engineering, firing, and barbering. The manual labor about the institution is, of course, performed by the inmates, of which there are at this date 189. Mr. A. W. Miller, the superintendent, is doing much constructive work with the young men committed to his charge, and we believe the institution is amply justifying itself. The difficulty of employing the penitentiary inmates at suitable labor that does not conflict too much with the prerogatives of the free workers of our state, has been pretty well overcome. The state still operates the fibre furniture factory which has been at the prison for some years, and has also established relations with the Oberman Company by which shirts are made and disposed of with a minimum of competition with free labor. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 INMATE POPULATION There are seventeen institutions under the control of the Board, and at this time (July 1, 1923) the inmate population is 5917, as compared with an average of 4 ( &gt;80 for the biennium ending in 1921, and 4907 for the biennium just prior to that.

            <seg id="p007">7 Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln — Grand Total. 4,538,783.65 At its various institutions the state owns something over 4000 acres of land, of which in excess of 3500 are in farm and garden. About 800 acres are rented in addition. Details of operation are given in the reports from the several superintendents which are appended hereto. The health of the inmate population has been generally good during the past biennium. We are pleased to be able to report that no epidemic has broken out at any of the institutions, and our medical men have been able to cope with such sporadic cases of contagious disease as have appeared. In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation of the efforts of the officers and employees of the various institutions in striving to bring about a betterment of the living conditions of the wards under their care. We wish also to thank the Governor for his manifestations of interest and for his assistance in the work of this department, and we trust that he will continue his efforts to help us provide better means of caring for the wards of the state.

            <seg id="p018">19 t To the Governor and the Hoard of Control of State Institutions Lincoln, Nebraska. I respectfully submit to you herewith the Nineteenth Biennial Report of the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded for the period ending June 30, l'J23. I report the following as having been accomplished during this period. A modern hospital has been constructed and fully equipped, and will be of wonderful assistance in the continuation of the policy of the Institution, of removing, as far as possible, the physical handicaps of our inmates. By the aid of this new equip - ment, the teeth will be most effectively looked after by the resident dentist, I soon to be appointed.) Any abnormality of the eyes will receive attention by a skilled physican. Nose and throat condi - tions will receive the attention of the physician in charge and all surgical case as well as the acutely ill will be cared for in the building, thereby filling two most important needs of the institution, first improving the general condition of the patient in caring for him away from the lower type of inmate, and affording better protection and comfort of his associates. A new bake shop is Hearing completion. A new oven and new equipment has been installed and will soon be in service, replacing the old one which has been in service for the past twenty-five years and is beyond repair. The officers' kitchen has been remodeled. A new velvetile floor has been put clown, new plumbing has been installed and the walls painted. The intfrior of several of the wards and school rooms as well as the officers' and employees' rooms have been repainted and re - decorated. New floors have been put in all basement rooms and the floors of the wards repaired. It has been our endeavor to keep everything up to the standard, and in all cases to improve the condition where it could be done without too much expense. Due to the increased cost of labor, paint, pipe and all other supplies, it </seg>

The teachers have much to do in making the parties and entertainments enjoyable to the children and the public, Programs relating to Hallowe'en, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, Memorial Day, a patriotic program in February, as well as closing exercises for the school, were prepared by the teachers outside of regular school hours and given as Institution entertainments. In the Kindergarten department are enrolled many children of lower mentality, the effort made being for their happiness, sense training and habit formation. In the Industrial, Manual Training and Art Work Depart - ments, many practical, attractive and useful products are made. In this department are taught fancy work, dressmaking, weaving, basketry, cutting and plain sewing. </seg>
