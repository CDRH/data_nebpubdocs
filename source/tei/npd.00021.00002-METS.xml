The value of Nebraska land is rapidly inci is is largely due to the products from the farm and at no period In st has farm land increased more than it has during the year just Only a few ycors ago good farms could be purchased at $lu to $2" per acre, and today nearly every daily paper has a notice of farms beiag sold from $so to $125 per acre. This has l&gt;een brought al&gt;oul i:i mams The weather conditions, good markets, improved manner of tilling ■Oil, and high standard in the breeding of live stock, which we. the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, should be given some credit in lending our aid in displaying the products of the soil to the muny and nf visitors who annually attend the state fair. It should be the aim of your officers to so manage the annual exhibition that it will in - all classes of patrons and to lay the foundation for future yen a much larger and more diversified exhibit than in the pas&gt;. We believe our efforts are meeting the approval of the public and that the E Board of Agriculture of the state of Nebraska is building a reputation to any other state in the I'nion. The state fair of today is not what it was ten or twenty years ago. We lowly drifting away from the amusement features to that of educa - tion, and there is a sweeping sentiment of agricultural education all over the country that is coming forward with a rushing influence, swaying the prblic opinion as it spreads from one organization to another. In ■iping nrr state fair we must not overlook the agricultural cdnc-itio i ■ the moulding of purer thoughts anil the mating of hiuhci Idl . it of our legitimate duty. The agricultural college, the experiment ' •'. the farmers' institute, the public s-hool. the agricultural ; the state fair, are all bringing a strong influence upon the minds of the public, to a higher plane of thought, a deeper sense of the realities and possibilities of the soil as the basis of success. I do not mean by educa - tional influence that we shall not have amusements on our fair ground, 'nit in the s^lectinET of our amusements care should be tal^en so jm to </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 K.te all that is in the least degree vulgar, indecent, and not helpful patrons. We have a great charge to direct and we either build up ucational standard of our state or we tear down what other are building up. The Nebraska Agricultural College, the farm - tiiute. the county fair and the state fair are all aiming at one great and that is the betterment of the agriculturist so as to enable him to produce a Letter article and receive a larger return for his labors, and in order to accomplish the greatest siwress they must all work rn har- IMPROVEMENTS ADDED IN THE PAST YEAR Bhave been laboring for many years to improve the transportation es from the city of Lincoln to the fair grounds and the past year ded n-.uch along this line, the Lincoln Traction Company having ed their line into the center of the grounds and th.- Citiztns Street y Company have built a new line from the east and southeast n of the city, giving us a daily street-car service all through the year. Bare justly proud of our new cattle barn, which is acknowlecK le far superior to any of our neighboring states Three of the old barns have been moved to the west side of the ground, one being &gt;i sheep and the other two for overflow of cattle and nurse rows. tnew auditorium I uilt fills a great felt want as it provides a good place for our patrons and the music and oratory furnished is the the country and there has never been a dollar spent on our grounds 4 met the approval of the public as well as this has done. The sheep barn has been remodeled and raised up and made Into a icciptahle educational building. One of the frame cattle barns was moved on the concession grounds and made into a theatre building. Bich grading has been done and a large amount of repairs was found sary to do after the destruction done by the flood of last July, and p sanitary board of the city of Lincoln are straightening Salt and ope creeks we hope that in the near future that all danger of this will l&gt;e obliterated. RAILROAD TRANSPORTATION At the meeting of the National Association of State Fairs held one year ago a committee on transportation was appointed of which our Secretary was a member. This committee appealed to the Western Passenger Asso - ciation for a fare of one and one-half cents per mile for state fairs, and, after much hard work and two meetings in Chicago, succeeded in having their request granted, which was afterwards withdrawn from the states of Wl.raska. Kansas and Missouri and later reinstated tn Nebraska through the personal efforts of Mr. W. S. Whitten. Secretary of the Lincoln Com - mercial Club, and Mr. C. E. Haynie, Manager of the International Har - r Company of Lincoln, and to these gentlemen we extend oux appreciation and thanks. This, wo think, will be the opening wedge for continued social rates for the coming state fairs. We owe much to the Burlington railroad for the increased facilities in the way of new plat - forms for the unloading and loading of exhibits at the state fair grounds </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 ATTENDANCE. K attendance at the last fair was about 18 per cent, greater than one o. This we think is attributed largely on account of the reduced rates. EXHIBITS. iws so must our exhibits, and the past year has shown an increase. The live slock was the largest we have ever had both in number and best in quality. Agricultural Hall never looked better. The tiional exhibit in its new quarters was very instructive and interest - ing. The farm machinery was not crowded as much as in former years on nit of more space being allotted them, which made it much more attractive to our patrons. The Art Hall as usual wad filled and much more . duld be used for the art and textile exhibit. The poultry, bees and dairy show iniprovenK nt. and much credit is due the Horticultural Society for the fine display and good showing they are able to make in the old building they are obliged to use. ATTRACTIONS ■e s]&gt;eed department this year had one of the best programs ever put r race track and we regret very much that we cannot accommodate of our patrons with seats in the grandstand. |?rati's band and the new auditorium could not have been better .1 drawing card to our fair. The night entertainment given first time was. we believe, a success, while from a remunerative jint did not quite pay out, but it gave many of our patrons from the city an attractive entertainment for the evening. CONCESSIONS. K-sionaire department is one of the hardest to manage of any grounds and your Board of Managers are endeavoring to wipe out MM thai arise from time to time in this department. THE 1909 FAIR. At a meeting of the National Association of State Fairs held in Chicago on December :!, 1908, the dates for Nebraska were allotted mber &gt;; to 10, inclusive. RECOMMENDATIONS Bst, The purchase of about thirty acres of land located west of our ine and extending west to Fourteenth street and from Fair street south to Salt creek on the north. This can be purchased at private by condemnation proceedings. Second, That the three old cattle barns be removed to the west side of the grounds for future use. Third, That we ask the present Legislature to appropriate a sufficient amount of money to build a new live stock building. Fourth, New and permanent water closets be constructed on the east side of the grounds. </seg>

Sixth, Accommodation for forage adjacent to new cattle barn Benth, That we change the plan of electing our members from the tive committee system to that of open meeting. The Nebraska State Board of Agriculture wishes to thank the exhibitors who so ably assisted in making our 1908 fair, the best and largest fair we have ever had, and we trust the benefits derived will in the future lead to greater efforts than in the past. This is a progressive age, and I am pleased to say that our exhibitors realize it by the progress made from year to year. OFFICERS, MANAGERS AND MEMBERS. Kish to express to all of them my hearty appreciation and thanks for e assistance given the fair for it is only with united efforts that we ike our fair a success, and I realize to many of you it is somewhat urden to give up your duties at home for six to ten days to come )rk from ten to twenty hours a day in order that our state fair may iccess, and to the officers and members of the Nebraska State Board iculture one and all much credit is due. Trusting that my efforts have met with your approval and commenda - tion. I remain. Your obedient servant, 0. H. Rl'DOE Rudge: The next order of business is the Secretary's ail. I r ess retary Mellor read the following address: REPORT OF SECRETARY To thf OJfem nutl Mt'mlirnt i,f the Nebrmtka statr Bitanl of Agriculturr In Nebraska the season of 1908 will long be remembered by agricul - turists as eclipsing all former year productions in value of products raised. Secretary Wilson, of the United States Department of Agriculture, has again assigned to Nebraska the position of third corn producing state of the I'nion, being exceeded in number of bushels only by Illinois and Iowa. with Missouri and Texas close on our heels. When we consider Nebraska's 1908 crops of corn, wheat and forage approximates 200 million of dollars in value, there is no denying the prosperity of our people. No state In the I'nion possesses superior natural advantages for the happiness of its inhabitants; no soil on earth is more prolific; no climate is more abound - ing in the combination of energy and health. STATISTICS. The wonderful agricultural fertility of Nebraska is glowingly por - trayed in the last report of the State Bureau of Statistics, which show the </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Kne of the remarkable features shown this year is the fact that ska's corn erop equals in value all the gold produced in all of the I States and Alaska combined: that Omaha is now the greatest market in the 1'nited States, and our dairy products now aggregate ).0O0. FARM LIFE utly, in the summing up of our national prosperity of the past four years, it was figured that our population has increased in that period of tinit- a trifle over 7 per cent., our agricultural product values 25 per cent., our live stock 44 i&gt;er cent., and the increase in live stock, farm products, gold production, coal production and bank deposits average 34 per cent These figures show the hank deposits to be thirteen billions of dollars, while the value of live stock and crops approaches nearly twelve billion The farmer's wealth, not including his land, when their individual deposits are considered, is greater than all the money deposited in the banks avail - able in the United States. Is it to be wondered at that agriculture is the hasis of wealth, when enough value is produced from the soil to absorb the money wealth of the nation, in a single year? Our farmers, almost in their entirety, enjoy rural free delivery, tele - phones, and all the modern conveniences which go to make farm life much more desirable than that which existed ten years ago. The trend of educational influence is more strongly centering toward the upholding of the desirability for the affluence and independence of farm life. The custom of teaching the farmers' boys that the ease and comfort of por - trayed city life is desirable, upon investigation is more and more found to be mythical and, in the near future, we confidently look toward the trend of our young manhood farmward instead of cityward. SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. The attendance at the School of Agriculture for the current year has exceeded all previous years by nearly 100 students. The registration for this year will reach 600 for the first time. This growth in interest and Id numbers conies from the fact that instruction of the most practical nature is offered by the school and that the young men who come here for instruction go back to the farms with knowledge which they can apply Yield Acreage Corn 6.339,019 Winter wheat 2.342,508 Spring wheat 203,102 Oats 2.353,839 Barley 95.758 86.614 Alfalfa 547.557 Tame hay 1.184.337 Wild hay H.iM Potatoes 1M.S77 Dairy products Poultry products ... per acre 28.17 16.99 13.98 23.86 22.26 14.62 3.37 tons 2.19 tons 1 .:!:: tons 85.08 Bushels 178,599,789 41,001,938 2,848,248 56.163,528 2.131,793 1,266.448 1.846.703 2.601,538 4.O6G.4O7 8,531,622 </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 Home Economics has been completed, and will be dedicated during meeting of Organized Agriculture. About fifty young women are in at - tendance at this school, and more than a hundred college women also ■ instruction in this building. While the last Legislature appropriated $100.00(1 for improveni' the farm, including a new judging pavilion for grain and live stock, a new heating and power plant, and the completion of the Women's Building, the repents have been able, in addition, to find money for the erection of a veterinary clinic building, at a cost of $12,500. and for the expenditure of about $15,000, in addition, for the improvement of the campus and for other general improvements. Even these generous appropriations have scarcely enabled the facilities of the school to keep pace with its growth in students, and at the present time there is urgent need of other build - ings and for still larger equipment. The regents of the University are asking the Legislature to appropriate $100,000 for a plant industry building to house the departments of horticulture, agricultural botany and forestry, and $55,000 for live stock, greenhouses, a stand-pipe for water supply, railroad switch to the boiler-house, a beef cattle plant, and other minor improvements. It is to be hoped that every citizen who believes in the ad - vancement of agricultural education will readily acknowledge the necessity for such appropriations and will advocate their passage by the Legislature The erection of the buildings asked will not by any means complete the plans for the growth of the Agricultural School, which. I understand, contemplate the erection at some future time of a building for farm mechanics, a building for an armory, gymnasium and general auditorium, a building for animal industry which will include animal husbandry, dairy husbandry, and animal pathology, and a modern horse barn, all of which are needed at the present time, and which cannot possibly tie erected aa rapidly as the necessities of the school will urgently demand. The success of the farm at the International at Chicago this year, as in the past, has done credit to the state. Five hundre-l and six' dollars was won in cash prizes on eleven sieers. including the first prize yearling Shorthorn steer, the first prize Galloway calf, the first prize grade Hereford yearling, the second prize Aberdeen-Angus calf, the third prlie Al erdeen-Angus two-year-old, the third prize grade two-year-old, and the first prize two-year-old carcass on a pure-bred Galloway entry. There were also several herd prizes won. and two Armour scholarships worth $250 each were awarded to this University, on account of the prizes won in open competition, making a total of $1,065 in prizes and scholarships. Another scholarship of $250 was won by the student judging team from Nebraska, this team being first in swine judging and second on all classes of stock judged. There were in all ten institutions competing in this contest. E record of the State Farm is also notable in the character of the ' dairy cattle maintained, including such cows as Katy Gerben No producing 18,573 pounds of milk and 723.85 pounds of butter in a year in her three-year-old form. Her mother, Karen, also in the ity herd, has a record practically equal to that above mentioned. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 Kerage production of the dairy herd for the year 1907 was over 400 of butter, while the average production of the dairy cows of Ne - is only 140 pounds. The methods by which this high decree of By is reached are the basis for instruction in dairying at the School culture. The Experiment Station has done efficient work in calling the attention of the farmers to economic methods in farm management and to the effect of Rood seed and approved methods of tillage. Statistics gathered by the Mat ion from a large number of farmers indicate that, on the average, land which lias been laid down to grass for two or more years when again planted to corn, gives an increased yield of at least one-third over that of adjoining fields which have been continuously in corn production and that in very many instances the yield is double that secured where corn has been continuously raised These inquiries also show that the changing of corn land to small grain for one or two crops materially improves the yield when again planted to corn. So universal is the testimony in favor • dins corn lands down to grass, that no one can question the benefits derived. The information at hand would indicate that, where land is placed in a seven-year rotation, three years being de\oted to alfalfa or to gram used for pasture, that as much grain will be raised in four following the period in grass, as would be raised by seven years of con - tinuous grain cropping. This leaves the profits of the land while in - as a direct benefit derived from the rotation. The work of the western station at North Platte continues to justify the lx»lief that under good methods of farming, great areas of land which have been devoted to grazing may be made profitable for farming purposes. In ••ar 1908 the yield of winter wheat on summer tilled land was from fifty to sixty-seven bushels per acre, where land of similar character which had not been summer tilled yielded but twenty-two bushels per acre. The yields of macaroni wheat, barley, and of oats would compare favorably with those of many Eastern farms, where the land is much higher priced. Pork is IxMng grown on alfalfa pasture and a medium grain ration at a profit, even in these times of high-priced corn and depressed markets for The results of the methods of feeding in practice will be published as an aid to the farmers in developing this industry in the region. The work of the farmers' institute to dissmiuate the best agricultural knowledge among the people is being continued. It has been necessary to reduce the number of institutes held this year, on account of lack of funds to complete the work of hiennium. About l"&gt;0 institutes will be held this winter, including two short courses in agricultural instruction of six days each, one to be held at Broken Bow and one at Hebron. There has lieen a large demand for these short course schools as an advanced form of farmers' institute work. Fifteen thousand dollars per year is asked for the next biennium in order that work of this class may be extended to all agricultural communities where sufficient interest is taken to make these schools a success. This Board, in conjunction with the Board of Horticul - ture, is endeavoring to supply these farmers' institutes with agricultural </seg>
            <seg id="p017">17 and horticultural reports. From week to w&lt; ml out a parka- each report to every institute for distribution. The demand for our report is so great that we are limited to a small shipment to each institute, as te total number of reports furnished by statute is bat (060, so. when we nsider the demand from libraries, schools, teachers, individuals, mem- bers of our Board, and these l"&gt;n farmers' institutes, it limits the supply- to be forwarded to each. The work being done by the farmers' institute department to promote boys' and girls' agricultural clubs has been MM ful and of unusual interest. About 11,000 boys and girls have been reached by this movement carried on by the farmers' Institute* In lO-oncration with the department of public instruction The agricultural communities of the state are its paramount oommer- is of more than commercial im - improvement of the social life and ■Interests. Agricultural education nee, since it is fundamental to the eneral welfare of rural communitU r people. It is conceded that the investigation in agriculture brinj s. which represent a large majority money expended in both education mmediate returns in in. profit from the land, in a higher standard of agricultural practice, and a better social life in the country. When it is considered that the annual value of our agricultural products alone exceeds $300,000,099 and tl a large degree the prosperity of our people is dependent on the general extention of agricultural knowledge, it would seem that any snin necessary for the promotion of this work in all its branches, would be readily forth - coming from the taxpayers of the State. COUNTRY LIFE COMMISSION LOne of the questions asked by the "country life commission " appointed President Roosevelt is, "Are the country homes in your vicinity as good rmr vicinity as good t should be?" The discussion of this question in thousands of rural should cause many a farmer who was about to invest his surplus s of the farm in southwestern lands to carefully weigh the question For the additional happiness of our farmers I would recommend that this Board of Agriculture urge the formation of BOT-pollttca]. am tarian, social Hubs among the farmers in each school district of Nctn and supply all societies desiring same with a uniform constitution and by-laws, and also send out to each society so organized, prior to its reeular meeting, a paper on some agricultural subject, to lie read at its m&gt; and to be thoroughly discussed and criticised. By this method we believe and ask himself if he should not have more conveniences in his home before buying land away from home. If the watering arrangements of his farm rannot he bettered by the use of some of Ute surplus monrv. so thai less labor will have to he performed; could a gasoline engine I advantage in running the separator, charm, sewing machine, feed mill. Of the pump on days when the wind does not blow; why not have a furnaef in the basement and a good bathroom in the house? Who could enjoy it more than the farmer? FARMERS- CLUB&amp; </seg>

We have appropriated funds for the promotion or carrying on of every siaie corn show, either by ihe boys and gii Corn Improvers' Association. Iluring the year 1M we began the work of gathering the agricultural statistics, without state funds, and while ii is true that the politicians have gradually BBSjraejaAed these deparin from us and are now furnishing money for same by appropriations granted to other departments, thereby dividing what should be in one department into three separate ones, still the State Board of Agriculture has an original field in which to continue its work for the upbuilding of the agricultural interests of Ibis great Nebraska. "Th» mornin;; I opportunity for choice STATE FAIR Sterling Morton once said: "The county, stale and national fairs, which are now proven so useful, are the protracted ■metiagl of husbandmen. where agricultural revivals are initiated and thousands annually con - verted to the faith of the great church of human industry." The truth of the above statement is exemplified in the great prosperity attending present day fairs, which continue to grow according to their respr merit. We think that we state but a fact when we say that the Nebiaaka §tate fair has never attained a higher degree of usefulness to our citizen - ship than during the year 1!»U8 That it is fasl becoming Ihe annual outing place for the progressive Nebraska farmer cannot be successfully controverted, and it should 1m» our aim in the future, as in the past, to Klose sight of the agricultural in, but let us steadfaslly con i a solid foundation on which ie permanent. good of our people.

From thf has held the banner state fair and date of the Chicago meeting, a year ago last December, your officers and department managers have been busily engaged in gathering together from all the varied industries of the great state of Nebraska the choicest exhibits for each department.

Then the great exposition was held: each one in charge was taxed to his </seg>

The Treasurer was hourly adding to the resources of the association and numerous clerks were King premium winnings and writing warrants, in a frantic endeavor jerly deplete the accumulation in the treasury; the bills were pre - audited and paid. In spite of these strenuous efforts to dispose of vast sums the receipts still remain greater than the expenditures. ■ ceding fair demands greater efforts and increased expense, and metimes find ourselves wondering when we shall reach the summit t l'|ton the closing of our gates comes the aftermath; the cleaning the years business. The compilations are made, tables prepared and a general report of our stewardship is demanded, and we are pleased to assume that the reports of lMt show good business management, so far as the Nebraska state fair and exposition is concerned. CORN EXPOSITION During the year, there has been held in Omaha a National Corn Ex - position, certain officers of which appeared before this Board in March last with a view of securing our financial and moral co-operation. This I tion" appropriated |Mt for the use of the commission appointed by or Sheldon, in the promotion of county organ i zat i&lt;m for the specific ■ of scientific corn raising.

These improvements will l&gt;e fully discussed by the report Board of Managers. DELEGATES For 1908 the president of the National Association of State Pairs and K\|&gt;ositions appointed your Secretary as one of a committee on railroad The first meeting of the committee was held in Chicago in May nd was attended by President Rudge during my absence in California. This meeting failed to secure rales for the various state fairs and a re - hearing was asked and allowed for July 23, at which meeting we secured the promise of reduced rates for the Western fairs. In August, however, the railroads sent out a statement that no rates would be allowed west of the Missouri river. President Rudge, accompanied by W. S. Whitten and C. E. Haynie, made another trip to Omaha and Chicago the week before the fair and were successful in reinstating the reduced rate which cer - tainly proved beneficial to this association.

This ply impresses us with the necessity for the erection of a ii. up-to-date, commodious grand stand, large enough to seat 8000 which, in addition to pleasing our patrons, will prove of consid- nnancial assistance. EXHIBITS. The report of tlie superintendents nf the various departments, with one or two exceptions, show the greatest number and most excellent line of own on the grounds. Exhibitors are becoming more firmly with the value of our state fair as an advertising and eommer - v. and our progressive, up-to-date superintendents are realizing (Tort in securing displays is productive of result. We hope that each iiiteiideni appointed in lUnH will put forth his best energy in securing ■parttnent the very best collection of exhibits ever shown in &lt;ka. COLISEUM At the last fair we were compelled to use a tent as a show ring for The live stock industry in Nebraska far exceeds that of Minne- Indiaua or Kentucky, which states have on their fair grounds models ; to-date live stock coliseums, each MO by IM feet, with a show ring of IM liy -Th feet, and it is our earnest desire that the Legislature of ;iska will not be content to allow this state to trail in the dust in this matter, but will realize the imi&gt;ortance of the live stock industry and provide us with a coliseum of which the live stock interests and Nebraska will !&gt;e proud. GRAND STAND. The great stale fairs recognize the importatice of large, commodious i stands with seating capacity sufficient to accommodate those who the speed events. Minnesota contemplates an appropriation of From their legislature for a new steel and reinforced concrete I stand, and Iowa is asking for $150,000 for the same purpose. We surely need grand stand accommodations than either of these states. Missouri built one three years ago at a cost of 177,000. This imrovement is as important to the future success of our fair as any one thing needed. «f liope that some means may be devised to permit increased ac - commodations this year In the l:ilter part of DMSjkR we sent out to each legislator elect a copy of the following statement: NIGHT ENT </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 In 19ui the Nebraska Legislature passed a bill for the appropriation of " with which to purchase a site for a permanent state fair ground. Of this amount $18,000 was fixed as the limit by the State Board of Public I .amis and Buildings, for the purchase of the present 123 acres. The cost of the tract, exclusive of the ten acres owned by the Lancaster Agri - cultural Society, was 22,300. After the State Board of Agriculture and the citizens of Lincoln had raised the balance of the money necessary for the transfer and secured the deed for the ten acres from the Lancaster Agricultural Society this land was deeded to the State of Nebraska. Dur - tag the year 1901 the balance of the original state appropriation, to-wit: $17 "im and an additional sum of $4.371. S5 furnished by the State Board of Agriculture, was expended on improvements ■ tar the holding Nebraska is practically the third agricultural state of the union and is third in greatest number of faim animals. Omaha is also the third market in the country for the number of animals handle I, hence the im portance of agricultural education is of great value to the citizens of Nebraska. The great incentive for this education is through the press (of whose loyalty Nebraska is extremely favored), the Agricultural School, farmers' institutes and at the places where the object lessons inspir - people to greater or more concentrated effort, such an inspiration aa is secured to the actual farmer by his attendance at the state fair, where m study the excellent qualifications of animals, fowls, crop pn tion. scientific machinery and such other object lessons which explain and educate at a glance. Nebraska, with its great wealth-producing power, is destined to be - come one of the richest commonwealths of th* nation, and the era of Immanency in public buildings is at hand.

Other states, greater debts and less wealth-producing power, are recognizing the in ample, commodious, permanent structures for public occupancy entertainment, and we believe the wide-awake, go-ahead, generous iship of our state, when once acquainted with the facts, will feel a pride in making an effort to retain Nebraska's rank in our structures ?ll as in our agriculture. There are three buildings whirh thestite fair management cannot hope to erect on the state fair grounds without legislative help: they are a live stock pavilion such as other states enjoy; a steel and reinforced concrete grand stand, to seat HHiiio i&gt;eople; and a machinery hall. It is possible for the management to permanently erect, out of its profits from time to time, an agricultural hall, horticultural hall, ladies' art. textile and domes - tic products building, dairy, poultry, bee and honey bindings, barns and smaller structures which can be ere&gt;ted with less than thirty to forty thousand dollars each: hut it is entirely out of the question for the management to ever hope to secure a surplus of one hundred thoi dollars which amount will be necessary to erect any one of the first three mentioned structures. \\V draw this conclusion from past experien ■■•'. for, while tlie sun fmi'ls shown at the annual meeting of the State Board of Agriculture has remarkable, still when we remember that this surplus of the past iliri--- years has been in excess of that shown during the preceding seven teen years, then we realize that the possibilities of a large accumulation of funds In any one year is very remote, and that the powers of the Board for the erection of these three large structures without legislative aid is impossible. This fair ground is state property, and is the most valuable owned by the state today, considering the amount of expenditure. The appropriation to the State Board of Agriculture is but $2."i&gt;o par annum and the printing of five thousand reports, about four thousand of which are destributed at our farmers' institutes, sent out by money fur - nished by the State Board of Agriculture. This Board, out of its funds. has also furnished practically all the money for promotion and premiums at our various state corn shows, and contributed the first $500 to the Nebraska Corn Commission which was the funds used for all the early Nebraska promotion of the National Corn Exposition at Omaha. This Board has for years been an advertising agency for the promotion of the agricultural interests of Nebraska, and in such capacity gives information to thousands outside as well as inside the state. It has initiated. fo&gt; and proposed nearly every meritorious agricultural law on our statute books and its influence as a factor for Nebraska's public upbuilding has \wen without a peer.

Each of the - buildings which have been erected siTice ours has been improved upon Our building is an exact reproduction of the one on the Illinois state fair grounds and was built the following year. Next Missouri built one, then Minnesota, Wisconsin. Indiana and Kentucky, at Louisville. I think the pavilion on the Indiana state fair grounds at Indianapolis is probably the most perfect of any that has been constructed; it cost them, however, in the neighborhood of $100,000 to Jiio.oon. Our building was built in and cost about $4r&gt;.0on. The outside dimensions are 1"r&gt; by 22r&gt; feet, the ring being 120 feet by 170.

            <seg id="p082">82 Mr. Hendershot: What is the total of the money on hand? R'TPurfr Russell: The total of the money on hand, according to this, 406.01. Out of that there would be $165 or $165.25, I think it is. iald warrants that are outstanding of the series of 1908, leaving. 11 warrants paid. $31,200 and something. I haven't it here. Mr. Hendershot: Do you know the amount in the reserve fund at the present time? Mr. Russell: $7,170.19 Secretary Mellor: Does that contemplate the reserve of this year? Treasurer Russell: No. Secretary Mellor: What total will that make? Isasurer Russell: Just a minute. It will be $9,593.77 when this is erred, and then add to that the certificates of deposit in the reserve bearing date, two of them. May 20. last, and the other In October, k. sometime later. T don't Just remember now, but there will be ned interest on them, or earned Interest unpaid. We will have we transfer $9,643.77. and the Interest would be somewhere in the Jorhood of $200. or $175. That would make about $9,700, or Dome - like that. In the reserve fund. (Applause.") Mr. Hendershot: I believe $10,000 Is the limit in the reserve fund. Is Secretary Mellor: In answer to Mr. Hendershot's question: I looked that up. I had the same impression that he did, but there was no order about this. Just continues until It is revoked by this board. Se"retarv Mellor: It roisrht 1p of some interest to some of the people here to know that the funds on hand for the last three years, that is, excess funds on hand, more than equals the 17 years prior to that time. ■•. Hendershot: T would like to ask the treasurer if the funds on account are drawing Interest. Treasurer Russell: Mr. President. I will state that they are. Tie arrangements were made when we transferred the accounts at last fair from the Fir«t National Fank to the Central National Bank of this city that all funds kept on open account in the Central National Bank should bear 2 r&gt;er cent Mr. Hendershot: Dally balance? Treasurer Russell: Daily balance, except the three months following the state fair, and during that time $1,000 is taken out of the dally balance and tbe interest computer! on the amount less that $1,000 on account of floatinc: wdrratits .Vr Fox and I agreed on that as an equitable basis. And outside of that, the balance of the funds is carried in different banks through the state, which I think the Auditing Committee will report on, and the interest is 3 and 4 per cent, varying at different places— one bank 2 per cent. The rest are 3 and 4, according to the length of time the deposit is made. President Rudge: Any other questions to ask the treasurer? Now, tbe next order of business will be the report of the Board of Manager*. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">83 Mr. Cook read the following report: KEPOKT OF THE BOAKD OF MANAGERS To the President, Members and Delegate* of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: Gcktucmen: As chairman of your Board of Managers I desire to sub - mit a brief report of the work of the Board for the past year. After our annual meeting last year there was a balance in our treasury, available (or construction purposes, of about $2U,UUO. To this might be added the state's special appropriation of $2U,uuO for the building on our ground! of a sanitary cattle barn, making approximately $40,000 for permanent improvements and repairs in sight for the year. Your Board, in conjunction with the Slate Board of Public Lands and Buildings, after carefully investigating plans and location, contracted for a sanitary barn, construction to be as near fire-proof as possible, lor the sum of $20,000. It was found, after the work was under way, that your Board would be required to make an additional appropriation from their own resources to the amount of $3,U0o, for the completion of the barn as to size and finish, so that it would meet the requirements of this exhibit. By an extra effort on the part of your Board and ihe contractor we were able to bring the work to completion In time to house our exhibit at the fair of laos. The approval of the exhibitors and the general public was very gratifying, especially during the period the barn was in use. K Board of Managers have endeavored to make the needed int - ents on our grounds, in keeping with the growth of the fair and elopment of our great state. The educational exhibit had so far outgrown the small quancra allotted to them that it became absolutely necessary to provide a building for this feature of our fair. To meet this condition your Board appro - priated the sheep barn at the south side of the grounds, rebuilding the same at an expense of $7uu, making a permanent housing for the educa - tional interests that will answer all purposes until our legislature Me* fit, at some future time, to appropriate for a large, permanent building. To provide for the sheep exhibit, we moved one of the old cattle barns to a position just north of the swine exhibit. Also moved two of the old cattle barns, locating them near the new live stock barn, to be used to accommodate the overflow in cattle exhibit. The new barn, together with the two old ones (permanently installed near), make it convenient to house upward of 700 cattle. Ei the growth of our fair and the steady increase in attendance it necessary to provide more entertainment for our visitors. To d your Board contracted for the construction of a permanent ium building, at a cost of $10,525; locating it centrally on our i, where the musical and speaking feature can be well appreciated </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 !many thousands can be seated comfortably; this, together with ihe . entertainments, put on for the first time at this last fair, proved a success financially and met with the general approval and appre - m of the public. Along this same line your Board moved one of the utle barns to the concession grounds, just north of Agricultural Hall, titled it up for a permanent theatre building, using it at our last lor a "moving picture" feature, with results very satisfactory to both Lbsociation and our visitors. The transportation facilities to and from the fair grounds have not been the best in the past The management have often tried to make the needed improvements along this line. During 1908 we were enabled to make arrangements with the Traction company to come into our grounds, unuer a contract that will, in the future, permit of the unloading of all passengers at a central point on the grounds by all street railway! operating in Lincoln. The flood which visited Lincoln in July of last year, while the work was in progress, did much damage to our grounds, requiring the regrading and fencing of the race track, expensive repairs on the grand stand, and the rebuilding of over one-half of the out fence around the grounds. We put on an extra force and were able to complete all work laid out by the opening day of the fair. Eive, in a general way, mentioned the more important improvements pair work accomplished during the last year. The total amount ed, as shown by the books of the association, (or the work and enients uuder our immediate supervision, is as follows: New auditorium $10,525.00 Excavations and fills 297.02 Moving buildings IW^l New plumbing 169.74 Material 4,11X73 Pay roll 3,711 24 Additional expended on live stock barn 3,000.00 |&gt;ng the immediate needs in the way of permanent improvements, jw grand stand at our race track. The east half of our present re must soon be condemned. With the present grand-stand capacity eaeluih we are able lo furnish only about 50 per cent of the 1 for seats on the two best days of our fair each year. This works t hardship to our patrons and is a loss of thousands of dollars association. The cattle exhibit has completely outgrown our present judging pavil - ion, and we are up to the time when a large, suitable building must be provided for this great feature of our exposition. Your Board held twelve regular meetings during the year, outside of </seg>
            <seg id="p085">85 fair week, with continuous sessions during the fair. Every member waa Johnnie on the spot" at all meetings, and at their post of duty during I wish at this time to express the appreciation of the Managing Board for the able assistance of all superintendents and help who so willingly contributed to the success of the 1908 fair. Also, I desire to think this State Board and delegates for your confidence, and we trust that the great fair of 1908, the disposition of the work and improvements placed upon the grounds, has your full approval. ectfully snbmin H. L. COOK, Chairman Board of Managers. President Rudge: The next order af business is the report of the Audit- ing Committee. Mr. Dickman: Mr. President, in ail meetings of this kind, we listen to the reports of the Secretary and Treasurer, and I think it la always necessary to have a committee that has to bn shown. I had the pleasure of being a member of that committee, and we beg leave to report as follows: (Mr. Dickman read the following report:) REPORT OF THE AUDITING COMMITTEE. We, your Auditing Committee, beg leave to make the following report: We have examined the books of the Secretary and Treasurer and find various sums as follows: Balance on hand from 1907 $21,280.03 Miscellaneous 1,393.53 Interest on deposits 650.97 Speed department 3,671.60 Pens and stalls 1,896.00 Concessions 10,429.99 State appropriation 2,000.00 Dray licenses 136.60 Ticket account 60,567.86 Shorthorn specials 676.60 $102,702.87 DISBURSEMENTS AND GENERAL FUXD.

HOWE, Auditing Committee President Kudge: Gentlemen, you have heard the report of the Audit- ing Committee. What will you do with the report? Mr. Searle: I more that the report be accepted and the committee discharged. (Seconded.) President Rudge: It has been moved and seconded that the report be accepted and the committee discharged. Any remarks? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying "Aye." Contrary "No." Motion la carried. The next order of business then would be the report of Committee on Revision of Premium List, if they are ready to report Mr. Hendershot: The committee is ready to report. However, there are a few items that will have to be referred to the incoming Board of Managers, as the revision of the educational departments needs some touching up, and one or two other places that we could not get at. Do you want the report now? Secretary Mellor: While you are getting the premium lists, I want to state that this (referring to box of cigars) has been sent by the American Sieel &amp; Wire Co., with their compliments; but 1 hope you will refrain from smoking until we get through with this business. Mr. Hendershot: I will say of the revision that in every instance where recommendations have come in they have been complied with; not only have we given them what they asked for, but in a few cases a little more, and several places we boosted a little more. President Rudge: I will say, gentlemen, that in reading over the cor- </seg>
            <seg id="p087">87 rections, If there are no objections offered, we will pass on and aJopt them as moved when we get through. If there Is any objection offered to them we will thresh it out at the time Mr. Hendershot: On page 8, under Superintendents, we added the Superintendent of Tickets. Eetary Meiior: We will have to have an auditorium superintendent Hendershot: We will add the word "Auditorium" under "Tickets." ident Rudge: They have never had a superintendent of what yon might call of tickets. The President has always had to do that, and last year the Board of Managers seemed to want tc relieve the President a little, so they appointed a Superintendent of Tickets, which yon will Bmost all state fairs have. That gave the President an opportunity with the Board of Managers, but heretofore he has had to give hia whole time to si'nerintpmline thp ti&lt;-l&lt;ets — as issuing stock tickets and cont-pssion tickets and all that class Mr. Hendershot: We recommend that no membe.- of the Board of Managers or Superintendent shall be an exhibitor. Mr. Russell: Mr. President, I don't believe that the first part of that Iht. The last part I heartiiv conr-ur in. I do not believe that the fact &amp; man is a member of the Board of Managers should cut him out entering animals and competing for premiums. I do think that a should not compete in a division In which he Is superintendent. I know that the idea is to get out of the way of prejudice that might exist In some exhibitors thinking that the Board of Managers appoint the Judges, and they would naturally favor the appointing power in awarding the premiums I 'Ion'' believe thit this nrp.indice would exist to the extent tbat it should lnr thp member* of the Board of Managers We have bar! members of tbp Poarrt of Manager* who were good exhibitors I of good animals. We have on the present Board of Managers Mr. Hen dershot. who has been an exhibitor at this fair and brought some good stuff here. The thing may arise In the future that some very valuable member of the Board of Managers may have a splendid exhibit here: then. If he should be on the Board of Managers, he is barred by this rule, and I, for one. do not think that thr meml^ersbip on a Board of Managers should bar a member from being an exhibitor. Mr. Graham: I would like to hear that read again. Read it again. Mr. Hendershot. Mr. Hendershot: It reads as follows: Under the head of Judges It ■ays: "No member of the Board of Managers, superintendent In his department or Judge will be permitted to serve In a class in which he may compete for a premium or have an owershlp in any animal or article in that class." t. Graham: This is added? Just added by the committee? . Hendershot: Yes, sir. Mr. Herrey: I am in favor of sustaining the action of this Revision Committee In their report. I think \t Is wisdom to cut out every appear </seg>
            <seg id="p088">88 ance of prejudice. There Is prejudice in the minds of the people against a fair manas&lt;&gt;r being a party — interested in the appointment of a judge There is no question about it. Now. I would agree with Mr. Russell In Krtlcular, that In all probability everything will be fair and honest as the intention of the Board of Managers is concerned, and ing will be right so far as that Judge is concerned, at the same time we have to deal with public opinion. If public opinion is prejudiced Kl a matter of this liind. we had hotter satisfy public opinion than terests of an individual. I think tha* the Revision Committee is entirely correct in the view that they have taken in this matter. Mr. Leonard: Almost all live stock exhibitors choose, practically choose. ■own Judge. They make recommendations at their annual meetings, rgestlons, to the Board of Managers of who they would like to have Iges, and they are appointed, and I don't see anything in all this at all. While on the surface it anpcais that the Board of Managers Bt these Judges, and frequently they are suggested, or used to be, superintendent of those departments, but right down at the bottom the exhibitors appoint their own President Rudpe: Are there anv other romar Mr. McArdle: Mr. President. I take issue with the suggestion of the committee, and also Mr. Hervey. I don't see anything wrong whatever members of the State Board can cut out the Board of Managers, it don't seem to me it is right. It is further casting a reflection upon our Board of Managers If I haven't pot faith enough in him acting squarely In competing. I certainly haven't got faith and confidence enough In him to elect a President who would appoint him. And it Isn't fair to the Judges. Most Judges we get are fair minded men, and I don't see why we should do this. If there is some reason, some ulterior motive, back of this, give it to us. If there is no reason except that it would be a good thing and favor the public opinion, T don't think it is necessary. I don't think public opinion bothers Its head about that. I don't think you have educated them up to that point, that they scrutinize that closely. If there is something behind this, some motive, why. give 1* to us. Let us hear what it Is. Mr Cook: It occurs to me that probably there is some criticism, as suggested by Mr. Hervey. It comes altogether from the fact that the people who criticise do not understand the situation. Now. wouldn't It be a good idea to make a little foot-note rieht down here and say in almost all cases judges are selected by the exhibitors — live stock Judges — are re - quested by the exhibitors themselves, and not arbitrarily appointed by the management? ,Xow. a little foot-note of that kind would dull some of this criticism I think that the clause is right without the Judge, and rn a member of the Foarrt of Ma &gt;mpeting for any premiums any n nore than a memtier of the State Board of Agrrionlt'ire. Members of the Board of Managers are but the rreatures of the Stale Board We don't •aise them to anv exalted position: and while it is admitted that the te- </seg>
            <seg id="p089">89 should stand uncorrected; but it might be well to make some little note of that kind so that the public might know. Mr. Hervey: The exhibitors could not suggest to the Board of Man- agers whom they want for judge. Only associations, breeders' «foct*- tions, can do that, and that is going to be the course that will be punned in state fairs generally, — that Breeders' associations are going to get to- gether at their annual meetings, and they will furnish a list of acceptable men as expert judges for their departments of breeding. Now, If Mr. Cook will change his wording just so as to apply to the breeders' associations, we can get at them and they can get at us, but so far as our exhibitors are concerned, we cannot wait until fair commences and then select a judge to suit the exhibitors that we are dealing with. Hervey, that at our Board meetings we Isu t it a have these suggestions long in advance of the fair? :istaiues. The others we have ap- pointed by getting individual recommendations of certain men that they ire nit in a general way had the recom- mendation from the breeders' associations to appoint this man or this i_'iw ii&gt; ■ list. Now. that is what we should have, and that certainly would be a great help. It ■:iayei&gt; in getting a Brel certainly would be a great help. It would be a great help to the Board would be a great help to the Board 11. .11 who is recognized through the n who is recognized through the whole United States as a good exhib exhib tor, and it would raise the standard tor, and it would raise the standard whole Ue ales a: of our fair just that much by having ; a first-class man who is recognised a first-class man who is recognized of our fair just that much by havin aa a first-class man at the fairs in a 1 towns throughout the country, and 1 towns throughout the country, and as a first-class man at the fairs in a ht. It would seem now we are mil of everybody knows that they are all rig everybody knows that they are all ri ht. It would seem now we are all of one opinion on this other question, I had reference there to a prejudice I had reference there to a prejudice one opinion on question that exists outside. Now, Mr. McAi Now, Mr. McA die, there isn't anybody that should here isn't anybody that should doubt our honesty in trying to get a good man, and we believe we do a good man, and we believe we do doubt our ho trying to get good judges, just as nearly as &gt; . t- possibly can; there is nothing to possibly can; there is nothing to as nearly a cover up; there is nothing back; there isn't anything that we feel as though we are implicated in not coming out entirely and fairly before the public. It is a prejudice that exists in the minds of the people that can't get at, — where we can't get at it, — if people outside are saying. we can't get I don't like that method. There are five men on the Board of Mr. Heuilershot. He right in that. He is one of the men that help select the judges, and look at the premiums he got." Now, people will say those things. Now I would like to fix this matter so that we just eliminate every possibility of criticism on the managers of this fair and the members of the State Board of Agriculture. I know that there is not a man in this audience. and I don't believe that there is a dishonest minded man in the State of Nebraska, who is a rriticiser of the work of this fair. I believe that they are all honest so far as this is concerned, but we have a public to deal with that is outside, and you can't go outside. Now, I respect public opinion. You can't keep people from doing that, and some one may say, "Oh, that class of people don't amount to anything." Now, they </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 Count to a good deal. And when they make those remarks we are t being injured that much; just injured that much. It doesn't make any difference whether it comes from a higher character or lower char - acter, and my sympathy is with the committee. Mr. Graham: Now, it seems to me, that if this rule should be adopted as recommended by the board that it might be a difficult question to get sufficient good members for the board.

Pio3iclent lludge: Leave in judge and superintendent? Mr. Russell: Yes, sir. Amendment accepted by both member putting the motion and the President Rudge: Now, are there any remarks? Mr. Russell: I want to just say another word in support of my ntien in this matter. You can't eliminate all the criticism, no matter what you do. I do not think that this criticism exists to any extent. I have been an exhibitor a good many years, and there is bound to be more or less criticism creep in, and we can't keep it out, and I think that as the matter now stands it is as nearly right as we can get it, and I certainly don't want to see any person barred from showing, and I will venture the assertion that you go among the exhibitors and ask them the question whether or not they want to see a good exhibit in any division made by a member, if it be, of the Board or the Board of Man - agers, and they will universally say, "Yes, let him come in and take his medicine, and we will do the same." I believe that would be the senti - ment almost universally. Mr. Hervey: And if he hasn't got a good exhibit he will have his medicine to take. Ksident Rudge: Are you ready for the question? (Question.) All In favor of the motion signify by saying "Aye." Contrar&gt; . is carried. B.

            <seg id="p091">91 REPORT OF ANNUAL MEETING Piot (reading) : The amphitheater tickets read "25 cents to of 25 cents as we now have It. I might explain that seal they are using in Kansas that goes onto the suspender n's trousers that saves carrying that ticket and showing 3t shows the button. Instead of using stock or conceaaton- Mr. Martin: There ought to be a change in tickets. I have been engaged for a number of years down at the big gate where those people come In, and it is a lot of bother having so many tickets and last year, or two years ago, we caught people selling them on the street car. There ought to be a change there, and fix it so that those people could not get them and go out and sell them. Three ladies came to the gate one day, and It happened to be after the hours that they were good, and I said. "These tickets are not good." And they said, "Why. we just bought them on the street car: paid 25 cents a piece for them." There ought to be some arrangements whereby we could eliminate that, and give a different kind of a ticket. I studied the thing over a good deal, and Mr. Prltchard and I studied It over, and I supposed he would he here. He had figured it out in his own mind what he was going to recommend, and you ought to do something with it Eident Rudge: I think the Board of Managers will be glad to hare ■ommendations that you care to give them In regard to the lm - pnt of the ticket system. There has been quite an effort to try and I from year to year on that ticket system. I. Martin: If I had the tickets here we had last year I could show here we could cut out three to good advantage. I don't remember »mes of them now, but they are a good deal of bother: and the teepers' work in the future would be cut down a good deal, and I been in a position to know a good deal about the trouble that i at the gate. Mr. Hendershot: Your committee and the secretary have Investigated the ticket proposition. I. Martin: Mr. President. I don't see how any of these parties get 3f those tickets unless It be through the Concession Department, there we have, for instance, those eating houses. There will be for twenty-five, thirty or forty afitpi^ion &lt; everv dav. Now. through restock departments they couldn't get three: they might get one. President Rudge: These are concession tickets. K. Leonard: Mr. President, wouldn't It be possible to eliminate that we give the tickets? For instance. Concession No. 1: He gets ten i. Stamp on the back of them. "No. 1, 2, 3, 4," and so on, and If re sold you could trace it to the one that got those tickets. 1 s It can be done that way. Secretary Mellor: Why not require the concessioner to write the n»me of the party on the ticket to whom he gives it; then if it is sold yon ran trace it right direct to who got it </seg>

It might be any other lady. I don't know one woman in a thousand or one man in a thousand that comes to the pate. And as for numbering thpm : Why, now. just like It was list year. We ran out of confession tickets on the large days and we had to stamp on the bark of a ticket — I believe we used the ripht tickets nnd use other datPs over. Now you couldn't — you can't do that I n't number them and pet any pood out of them.. There Is another [ want to call your attention to. Now. we pive those concession a permit.

He dropped off — and at that time we out down there near where the street cars enter the pronnds now — the party took the ladies up. It called for the driver and two ns. He took two ladles up and drove the huptrv down and thp little lumped on and they went down town, and pretty soon he came i. and it was two punches. Well.

I saw boys come rlpht In. saw ladles come In and they went rlpht up to the fence and d the tickets ont right through the wire fence and the men wanted me In and I didn't let them come In. And they went down to er gate, and they didn't know anything about, it and they came In. We bump up apainst that every year. Mr. McArdle: Mr. President, I believe that these suppestions are all right, but they are taking up time. If you refer the Board of Man - agora to the system that the National Corn Show adopted up at Omaha this year, I will guarantee there will be no tickets passed through the fence. Just look that up. It is a pretty good one. </seg>

Not to allow them to use straw at all In those pens? Mr. Hendershot: Therp is nn rpcommpndation of that kind, except that they are paying for the bedding, and we considered that If they paid for the sand, they wonld be very apt to use sand. The rule pertaining to that one class we can insert there Mr. Leonard: Here Is the point, as I understand It: If we charge them $1.50 for those pens and they are to use sand, and they dont want to use sand, it will he paying for bedding twice. The object of this recom- mendation from the superintendent of that department was from a sani- tary standpoint. There aint anything as good to hold the germs of disease as that straw and manure that is left in those pens. Sand is a good deal better for bedding on account of that Mr. Russell: Mr. President.

Thev might be thoroughbred horses, but their origin can't be traced. President Rudge: There is no motion before the house. ■.

President Rudge: If there is no objection, the committee will so change it. '.raham: Why should not the red polls be classed in the cham - plonshlp?

Mr. Hervey: I would like to make an amendment to that, that that committee consist of six instead of three Mr. Bassett: I will accept Hie anumlnient very readily. Mr. Hervey: That is what I have in mind. We have six congressional districts in the state, as we all know, and it just occurred to me that their apportionment, as nearly as it could be gotten at, might come before this committee, they might have that in view, and if they did take up such a proposition, it would be just as well to have a delegate or a member ■each congressional district.

Mr. Leonard: I think there are two or three plans that perhaps would like to be offered here. I am not in favor of this motion until those plans are offered, and select some one of those plans. I am in favor of electing this State Board of Agriculture from the floor, not as we have formerly done. I think there are some plans here that are just right now to be offered any time, and I would like to hear these plans before we pass any resolutions. Ir. McArdle: 1 am in favor of this motion for the simple reason that pedites business. Are we going to adopt this plan, or be governed le old plan? First, we want to know if we are going to adopt the ident's recommendation. After that we can take up motions. I t it is essential now that we adopt recommendations and not work plan first before we know whether we are going to change from the &gt;lan or not. Let us first find out whether we are going to change, then go ahead on some plan and take up this distribution. I think essential that this question be got before the house properly. Mr. Ollis: Would it be out of order if we have the recommendations read again? I think there are a number who have come In after it was read, and they do not understand what we are talking about. Secretary Mellor: That we change the plan of electing our members from the nominating committee system to that of open meeting. President Rudge: There is no plan outlined at all, Mr. Ollis. Mr. Ollis: I don't know whether ii outlined any particular plan or not. Mr. Hervey: I agree with Mr. McArdle's proposition. I don't see tbat there is anything wrong with the adoption of this gentleman's reso - lution. We then have a basis to go on. It cannot do any harm. It la right in the line of the sentiment, I believe, of every man In this house. The principle of election In open convention is absolutely correct. There cannot be a question in regard to that. It may not be applicable to certain kinds of organizations, and organizations like this, created for a certain purpose, the interests of that organization might be better served by the selection of men that we, possibly, would not be able to make right here; but I am satisfied that in sentiment It Is the right thing, and I think the thing to do now is to adopt this gentleman's reso - lution, and then go ahead with your methods or plans. Mr. Graham: I believe I have a right to be heard a moment on this before a vote is taken. The system that we have been working under was, that the committee name the members of the incoming Board. Now, the question that has been raised here by the recommendation of the President is, Shall we change that plan to electing on the floor of the house? And it is recommended that we change the plan. Now, the motion before the house is that the recommendation be adopted. I am not in favor of delegating the elective power to any committee, or to any single people.

Contrary "No." Motion is rnrried iinpni Secretary Mellor: Now, Mr. President. I will submit a plan, and you can tear it to pieces or adopt it just as you please. In order to cat this before the- house. Mr. President. I move you that the Board of Agriculture be made up as follows: Five members from the First Con - gressional District; three members from the Second: five members f'om the Third; six members from the Fourth; five members from the Fifth; and live members from the Sixth. I believe that makes twenty-nine. The reason that I make it in this way is, three members from the second, because the Second District only contains three counties. The state law reads that the membership of the State Board of Agriculture shall not consist of more than on» person from any one county, ex-ept Lancaster and Douglas, which may have not to exceed two. I think the original idea being that Lancaster and Douglas were the successive competitors for the state fair in the days that this law was made. Therefore, they allowed an extra man in each locality to assist in assuming the burdens that necessarily fall on the members that reside in the town in which the fair is located. Now, if there is any better or more reasonable plans — I hope you will suggest same — I would like to add to that motion that nominations be made, and an Australian ballot be used, prepared with the Kof all nominees distributed by districts. And at the head of each t be stated. "First District, vote for so many," whatever the • is, to fill vacancies up to the required number. "Second District, r so many," then we nn all vote on the Australian ballot and have our votes counted just the way we want them President Rudge: Gentlemen, you have heard th^ plans outlined by your Secretary.

Secretary Mellor: In order to give you a little more information on this subject; the Second District cast about 35,000 votes in the congres - sional election just closed: the First District cast about 42,000 — Mr. Hendershot: 38,000. Betary Mellor: 38,000; yes, that was it? And the Third District, l correct about it, 51.000: the Fourth District. 45,000; the Fifth , 41.0(in. and the Sixth District a little over 50,000. That is the at the congressional ticket shows up in the last election. But y idea I had for saying six for the fourth was because it is from ritory that draws the most people to Lincoln for the Fair. A Member: Question. President Rudge: Gentlemen: The question before the house is on Mr. Bassett's amendment. Mr. Cook: Now, let us understand what that division is President Rudge: The division is that the districts all receive five delegates, except the Second, which would have four. Mr. Graham: Mr. President, that will just change Mr. Mellor's plan. instead of giving the Fourth District six, it will give the Fourth District five, and the Second District four. f'sident Rudge: Are you ready for the question?

Leonard: In case when these ballots are counted that you should two, or three, or four from one county, if this law says that there only be one outside of these two counties, what will you do? Secretary Mellor: Declare the one having the highest number elected. Mr. Leonard: Suppose you rheek up. You know there are some hold - overs, and you say we cannot have to exceed one from any county except Douglas and Lancaster which may have two. Mr. Mellor: I think it is a statutory provision Mr. Hendershot: We looked that up last year. It is statutory. Secretary Mellor: It says only one shall be elected from any one county, except Douglas and Lancaster, which may have not to exceed two. It. Leonard: Suppose one man in one county holds over and he is id from another one, then you can't elect another man to go into county. What are you going to do when you count the ballots and it is that way?

            <seg id="p111">111 Mr. Russell: Mr. President, there is a matter that I want to bring before this Board, and I think this would be a good time. It is a small thing, but it is a matter I have thought about. It is a certificate of mem - bership.

January 20. 1909 By Mr. Mellor: Ladies and Gentlemen: Before beginning our evening's program I would like to make an announcement for tomorrow evening. Tomorrow evening Mr. G. W. Wattles, of Omaha, will give an illustrated lecture on "Country Life in Foreign Lands." and we shall also be favored by the quartet with another program. This evening Secretary Keyser and myself thought it would be wl«e to have three classes of education represented on the platform. As you all know, I believe in objective education, while Dean Burnett is an exponent of agricultural education, and I informed Superintendent Bi^op a few moments ago that he would have to class his as lull 111 i ln«l I'dnca - tion. In looking Into your faces this evening it reminds me of a story that Governor Glenn of North Carolina used to tell. As he was going down the street one evening he met an old darkey, and he siid to the darkey. "Sambo, are you an optimist or a pessimist?" That kind of staggered Sambo, and he scratched his head a minute and said: "Well sir, I saw a tree with ripe persimmons rlar de odder day. and," he says, "while going down by the creek, I saw a nice young fat 'possum, and when I was going home, I saw some hills of potatoes just a-bustin' the groun' an' I </seg>

And ther arf a tremendous lot out of them for the future: and I want to say to you that I do not believe any meeting of any kind that takes into considera- tion our great agriculture is complete without the bojs and the girls and the women in it. And so I am in favor of clubs and parties and things of that kind that will bring us all In the home. A man is better when his wife is around: anil the man ii Inter when the hoys and girls raphf </seg>
            <seg id="p114">114 are around. And so I am here tonight, and I want to point out the reason why I am here — not because of this corn that I am to talk about some tonight; not bseMSS nf your stork: not because of your agriculture; I am here because I am interested in the homes of this state and of this country. [Applause] I am interested in Iowa in helping the people to study corn, not I care so much about corn, but I do feel that it is of tremendous importance to the people of this land what they haye to live with — for the home and ftood citizenship. So it is, when I pet through with the little that I have to say this evening, you will know something of the motives, the purposes, that bring me here. I would not come ten rods from my home and my children that need my attention considerable of the time, as all children do — need a whipping pretty often — if it were not for the Interest that I have in this great work of citizenship: and I sometimes think we do not appreciate these homes of ours. Over in Michigan — and I think some of the boys that are here. Profpssor Burnett. Professor Smith and Pro - fessor Humphrey and others that graduated at the Michigan Agricultural College and lived In Michigan, will agree with me — there is a certain difference in those perule. who die their living cut of the rocks and out of the rugged hills, and the people who make their living so easily as we do. Sometimes over In Iowa people ask me to go out to their farms. In HieMgMl they as!-' me to tro out to 'heir home: and there is a tre - mendous difference. In Michigan a man speaks about being brought up. Down in Iowa they speak about being raised: just as though it were along with the pigs and calves. Do you know, I have sometimes thought as I have talked to the people of Iowa that I wish they had to go back Into Michigan, go into New England, into Pennsylvania, Into some of those states, and wake up there some morning and feel that they must live there for the rest rf their lives: and there they would hive to add the fertility to the soil in order to grow a crop, and it would keep them working and digging to make a living: and then after six months of the life there. I wish they could come back here to Iowa and to Nebraska and live here. I tell you. they wonl'l ann-edite the sreat opportunities they have here. "Necessity is the mother of invention," and people work w.ien they have to. When T-'iy. then we work and strive and toil: and here is one of the meancs' Mt»'e things I think I almost ever say; but I can't help usinp; it for illi'stration. because it comes to me so often, and you will pardon me if it sounds kind of bad here. My father used to come home from surveying, he was county surveyor, and when he would come In at night he always came along by the pig pen. I don't know why, but he did. And sometimes as he came along by the pen he would rattle the fence, and the pigs would be running up and down the fence grunting and squealing; and then father would come up to the house and up to our beds and say, "Boys, boys, did you feed the pigs tonight?" Now. there was no use to argue with a squealing pig.. There was nothing to do but </seg>
            <seg id="p115">115 along there and rattle the fence, and the pigs would just raise up and say, "Uh, Uh." You see. they had been fed. Now, sometimes when I talk to the splendid people of Iowa (wouldn't say that about the people of Nebraska), they will just kind of raise up and grunt. Now, that sounds like a hard thing to say, but it expresses exactly the situation. We will work if we have to; but go into Europe, and, there you will find In Austria the great Illinois prairies — Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska prairies of Europe. Do you find people here in this country from Austria? Have the people come out from Austria to help build up the world and make it what it is? You never hear of anything coming out of Austria. They live too easily. It is out of Scotland, Ireland, England, Germany, Norway and Sweden our men have come who have made this America what it is. Men that dug their living out of the rocks and the sides of those hills. And so the greatest fear I have is not of famine. 1 cm satisfied there are plenty of you people that will manage to get through this winter by being a little economical and eating porridge and bean soup all spring. You will get through all right. I am not afraid of your starving to death. There are people here that have got enough in their cellars to keep a whole township alone; and yet, in some parts of the world there are people dying — starving to death. But I do fear the rotting out of people who live so easily; so I want you with me to see what we can do to stir the people up to their advantages — to take advantage of the great opportunities they have here. We must all try to do our best in this world; and to do our best, we must do batter today than we did vesterday. I wish every boy and girl in this whole great country had that for a motto; not trying to beat someone else. That wouU not be any great credit; but to beat their own records. That is a great achievement at any time and any place. Over here at Marshalltown we were going to hold a short course and I went down with another man to the church, and we went down around the church to the house to see the per - son that had the keys, and he went in. A little girl came out, and she said, "Mr. Holden, I understand you are going to have a short course in Marshalltown"; and I said, "We are thinking of it, if we can find a good place for the room." And she said, "Well, do you know, I hope you will have," she says. "You know 1 have been scrubbing that back porch, and," she says "I just like to scrub that porch. I did it better today than I did yesterday." What a lesson! Liked to scrub that porch! Did it better today than she did yesterday! Do you know, too many times our schools and our parents, the parents of our people, lead the boy and the girl to think that they should get an education so they will not have to work. How often have I heard that in Iowa. Why, our boys and girls should get an education so they can work harder, do more, accomplish more in this world. Do you know that our educated people, that our people we call educated — -school people — are getting nearer to the common people? They used to be a long ways apart. There was a time when the farmer and the business man and the manu- </seg>
            <seg id="p116">116 facturer looked at this fellow wl called himself educated, this fellow with the long coat, ami long fin and. long nose and sunken ey* white finger nails, and they call him educated: and yet we all knew M impr That was all. He I was not educated anv more than a an who has nothing in his head, but just works with his hands, i :]- The one was just as far from it finding that education means that education as the other. We are now which fits a boy or girl for the dutif of life. And if education means f life, then we must teach in our fitting a boy or girl for the dut schools some of the things that a boy and girl must do afterwards for a and that is one of the reason why I am here tonight — to speak e of those things from an edu ■ational standpoint, because that is where I am interested. I remember when I was teaching district school In money to go 10 school with. I o bring an ear of corn, tl norning. And when I got there . they were there, bright and to do with thai corn. And the the table, and we looked it over • ars. and we judged it thf asked eleven members of the class one they could find, to school the it the next morning to open up the larly. anxious to see what I was brought 'he corn in and we laid and we decide! that this was one best we could We did not know much about it. and we never will know such a great deal about it: but we looked it over and decided that ihis was the best ear and we put it down at this end of the table, and we decided that this was a fair one. and that this was the poorest In the - after the father had asked th looked up and said. "Say. pa. the to ot. And that night, in one of those blessing at the table, this little boy her says you got the poorest ear in « hole bunch." Thai e of you people will say.

            <seg id="p118">118 taxes should receive some of the benefit of those taxes, and it must go to the people— go into their own towns. And, now, right at this time, we have over 80 requests for short courses in Iowa. I picked up a paper here today ( I guess it is in my other pocket ) and sat down at the telephone up here at your college, and called up one of our short courses, over at Avoca, to learn how they are getting along, and in this paper it said, "Great en - thusiasm over the short courses. Great success. They have already sold 540 tickets for next year." One of you people that used to live in Iowa moved over here and still takes a paper from there, and you had left it there by the telephone, and I have it in my pocket row. I was coming down on the train this morning, and in the Omaha Bee I noticed that 'he Commercial Club is trying to secure the next year's short course at Council Bluffs. It is being held at Avoca, and they are to send a committee over to see if they can bring that short course to Council Bluffs; and so it is all over the state they are getting up parties and committees and :&gt;g them down to Ames and demanding a short course. In that way we get out to the people and help them a little to stir up enthusiasm, there is nothing like stiring people up— jogging ourselves to do a little better. And if we are to appreciate thes=e opportunities that we are now offered, instead of sitting down and just rusting out — just eating and rusting out, and that is all, why, then we must stir ourselves up; we must help one another; we must work together. No people on the face of the earth ever accomplished their greatest mission that did not work together, study together, have meetings together, help each other to feel the respon - sibility of one upon another. Why. this year we are holding eighteen, about eighteen, of those short courses with, on an average, 320 at each of them — some more and some a little less. It is just like a school of your people — for there were about as many there as there are represented here — just about what we have for one of those short courses. We divide them into two sections, and one-half of them goes over to the stock judging pavilion, and there they have their stallions, and their mares and their beef animals, and sheep and bogs, and there they are required to R those animals and tell why they so class them; and then the 'tor in charge of the work points out their defects and their irood es, and he classes them, and shows the students why they are wrong r are wrong, and why they are right if they are right. Why, you &gt;o idea of the amount of interest that is developed there. And then n the corn room, each of them sits down at a table with ten rara before him, and he is asked to pick out that ear of corn which in his opinion is better than the rest. The profitable ear, the corn that will ■ well without much water, and so on. Judges it and studies it in way. And then he is shown about his mistakes; and in the short that he is there, he learns things about corn that he never thought of before. And then the domestic science people have a room there, and the people meet for their demonstrations. And at the close of the course we ask them if they want another short course. </seg>
            <seg id="p119">119 Now, you want to know perhaps how these short courses are gotten. and the method of handling them. Well, there is a committee appointed and sent down to see us. That is one of the first things, and they tell ns that they want a short course. I say. "How hadly do' you want this course?" And I say that I will go over and see them. And then I go over and see them, and they get a good many of the people together, and we talk it over, and finally if I conclude they are In earnest. I make this proposition to them: If they will get up a giiar - antpp or pledge, and have it signed by 200 people, one hundred bus - iness men. and one hundred from the country. (I want both of them. The city Is as much interested, or a town is as much Interested in agri - culture as the farmers? themselves, and when there Is anv feeling between the two. we won't go near them at all.. They must work together.) One hundred of the farmers and one hundred of the business men. each to pnt down onposite their names $20 or *25. or whatever It mav he. I don't care Kr thev nut down any atronnt. but they must guarantee to take anv deficit that mav — from the running of that short course, hen 200 sign it it meins it will be a flashed success If there Is a $200 or $300 or $400 deficit when we get through ore fellow Is not obliged to reach down in his noeket and nnv for that short course. And these matters must he handled on a business basis or thev will go to riecps. Now. yon notice the primary motive back of that guarantee pledge Is this: When we eet 200 nponle ha^k of It. thev advertise the course-. It doesn't belong to tbe colletre. snv more: it Is theirs It belongs to them, and they are boosters — "&gt;00 boosters for the short ronrses.

It is not uch we teach for the sake of agriculture that is important; but it jrtant how much we make out of that boy and out of that girl. w. I am going to talk to you a little bit about corn. I will illustrate some of the points by saying that if I owned thefaims in this county, and this state, and ypu were my tenants, there are four things that I would demand: four things that are in the power of everyone to do. and they would have to do them or else get off these farms, if I owned them. One would be this: If I could just give one crder, I would order that six kernels from every ear be tested, instead of going out and planting thou - sands of kernels of corn, and guessing about their growth, giving up our land all summer, and our labor, I would have them tested. It doesn't cost anything and anyone could do it. I would have everv ear tested, and I would have that corn graded for the planter, and the planter tested, and </seg>

            <seg id="p122">122 I thought I had a good chance to catch him and I threw the ball to second; but, much to my surprise, the fellow on third base ran in home and the fellow on second, instead of going back, ran on to third base, and I saw that I had made a mistake someway. The captain hollowed at me (he was a level headed fellow) and he stopped the game, and called up all the members of the team, and he said, "We are not playing ball. W« have got to get our heads into this game." That is what we have got to do in Nebraska. We have got to get our heads into the game. One day up in Iowa, after I had said that one little ear of corn as small as this one. or one little ear like that, to each hill would make 33 bushels to the acre, a boy came up afterwards and he picked up that ear and he looked it over, and he said, "Mr. Holden, is it possible that one little ear like this to each hill would make thirty-three bushels to the acre?" And I said, "You can figure it out and set-." He said, "That is just about what my pa got this year," and I saw he looked kind of discouraged about it. He looked at me for a minute, and then he sai.l, "There are a whole lot of stalks in our field fooling around all summer doing nothing." And he was right. re is a hill I went out and got in the corn fields; both of these stalks growing side by side; and one man tried to tell me that this is a sucker. "No," I said, "the fellow that planted It was the sucker." [Laughter.] Now, I will tell you how I know. One of the boys out thtre, Mr. Ollis, went out with me, and we dug them up to see if we could see right where the kernel was, so we would be sure and know what we were talking about. These grew side by side, and this stalk was fooling around all summer doing nothing. Do you know that when we grow a stalk like that we are fooling around all summer doing nothing? We haven't got our heads into the game yet. This was growing in good rich soil, and there are thousands of them in every acre, — fooling around all summer doing nothing. And bo I could go on here picking them out. Here was another hill with these stalks in it. There was a pretty good ear; there was just a medium stalk producing a little ear like that— just about half what it ought. When we were cultivating that, stalk we were fool'ng around half of our time doing nothing. And then here was this one — fooling around all summer doing nothing. Again, right in the same hill, had the same opportunities, side by side, and so I could go on here showing you. Here is another hill, side by side, and this one was so little the fellow husking it didn't see it at all. There is an ear of corn there. Here are two of them from the same hill. On one of them the ear has grown away up here, and the other away down here. Had the same opportunities, the aame amount of cultivation, but one of them has grown up here just like some of us folks— one will grow up to be fat, and big and jolly and be lazy, and then another will be lean and lank like I am. And then here is another hill with three stalks in this hill. And here is this fellow,— a sturdy, fine-looking fellow, and look at this one. I don't know what is in here, but I am going to see. Oh, here it is. And we were fooling aroind </seg>
            <seg id="p123">123 two-thirds or three-fourths of our time doing nothing while we were producing that fellow. Just as big as any other, just like some folks, big as other people, but they will not do anything. Here is this fellow up here. (Husks ear of corn from stalk.) And that is the best this could do. [Laughter.] Well, now, men, it is not to be laughed at, because you hare all got them at home. You have seen them every day of your lives, prob - ably thousands on your own farms, but you never studied it; you have never gone in there and studied it. And it means wasted land; wasted labor. In Iowa I have studied over five thousand corn fields since I have been there, so you see I know something about the conditions of the fields: and I have studied quite a good many in your state in the edges where I happened to be. I was over this summer to one of your Chautauquas. Here are two fields I want to call your attention to, because they teach a great lesson, and they represent so many things I have found in short courses. One of the boys took my chart to take to another place, but this represents almost exactly the results over here at Coon Rapids. This represents the two fields side by side. I got in there one night and was to attend an institute the next morning. I got in a little early, and they didn't know I was there. I heard some men talking about driving up across to Glidden the next morning, to catch the Northwestern at 'hat place. I asked them if they would have any objections to my riding with them up there for a ways, and they said, "No, but you will hare to p early in the morninjr. for we are going to start pretty soon after 5 o'clock." and I said. "All right. I will be with you." A little after 5 we were started out By the time it began to get daylight we had got out about five miles, and I said, "I thank you for my ride. I will get out here, and study each corn field clear back to Coon Rapids, so I will know what I am talking about." I went into the first place I came to, and found the m -mi changing his wagon box and putting bis rack on, and I began talking with him casually. He didn't ask me my name, and I didn't ask him his. We had been talking some time when the door opened, and his wife said to him to come to breakfast: but I kept right on talking, and by and by she opened the door again, and said, "John, I want you to come to break - fast. Everything is jrettinK cold." Now, I am afraid too often, men, we do kind of hang around and keep the women waiting. You know, it is the pride of every woman to have things in good condition. I just kept talking to him. though. I hadn't had my breakfast; that was all. [Laughter.] And finally he shuffled around and looked at me as if to see bow much cheek I had, and he saw I was not going to go, and so he said, "Say. have you been to breakfast?" I said, "No;" and he said, "Come on in and have breakfast." He didn't ask me my name; and along through the meal as we were eating away, I took occasion to ask him if he were going down to the farmer's institute to hear the talk on corn. He said, I guess I knew more about corn before that fellow was born that he will ever know." I kept busy eating then, and finally he mistrusted something, and he turned to me and said, "What is your name?" I told </seg>
            <seg id="p124">124 him my name, and he threw down his knife and fork like that, and said, 'You are not the man thai is going to talk at the Institute are you?" And I said, -Yes. I am BOing to try to a little." And he said. 'That was a very rude thing to say. ' and he tried to apologize for it, and I said, ■ Don't you worry at all. You don't need to apologize to me. You have told what you believe to be the truth, and that is more than most of us can do." He said he didn't feel like that. I said. "If you will go into your corn field with me after breakfast and spend half an hour studying this corn with me. I will never give you away." And I haven't to thi;- And here is what I found. We usually go out into those corn fields and begin and count 1M hills, and then wp take another place and count another hundred, and another and count again So we counted Ihem up. and we found that there were 17 bare hills out of 100. Seventeen per cent, of them that were missing. Seventeen per cent, of the hills that were not producing anything, hut they had to be cultivated an.l taken care of all summer, and they grew nothing but weeds. And then there were 39 hills with only one stalk. They were not producin alf of Sthey ought to produce Then there were two stalks to the balance ■ hills. These were not producing quite all they ought to. And that there were 20 per cent, of the stalks fooling around all er doing nothing in addition to that. And when we nrt throueh hrough he looked out over the field as we walked back, and seemed to be sorry about it. I didn't know whether he was mad at me or not. He B1 along with me up to thf i and thank him for irivin: through the rail there and •r thought of this like that gate, and I was just about to turn me my breakfast, when he put his aid. "Wait a minute. Do you know, before." and he shook his head and looked out over the corn field. And he spread out his arms and Mr Holden. is it possible that about twenty per cent, of my field out there that I have plowed and harrowed and cultivated will not pro anything: that about one-half of every days labor is lost and it will not produce anything?" And I said. "My dear .sir. I am afraid it is so." and I knew another thing which I did not have the courage to say to him. and that was that of the labor of the mother and the two girls, about half of it was lost— time that did not count anything when they were laboring, washing, and scrubbing. And to me the most precious thins in all this world is the labor of a human being. What a man can produce by his labor is the measure of his intelligence. Do you know when a man has a good cornfield everything is all right. 1 have s.en it so often over in Iowa. He will holler at me when I get out'and say. "I want you to •ee my cornfield." But when he has a poor field something is wrong with 'hing When I get down there he doesn- want to see me. A man me.

I Uriah a good d^al of it is due to Mr. Mumford. who has done so much along those lines. And think of it! A few years ago — twelve years — thev were apnronriatine $300 a vear for agriculture. Now. they are asking for nearlv a million dollars for agriculture alone — some $800,000. Over in Iowa we have not got so- far along yet as they have in Illiniio Hrt our legislature is very generous wtth us.

And then Mr. Jones' corn in the next strip, and we kept planting until we got that all planted. We planted Biree kernels in the hill, and planted it by hand so as to know that one would have just the same chance. When we planted once, we 1 again and planted again and again — four times. These are the &lt;&gt;n the corn planted four times. Look at the yield from these five best ones out of 94 in that county. I want to say this: If you are going to try new varieties of corn, try it carefully. Get it and put a little in at a time. Let your county experiment station try it for the whole county. It costs you too much to plan 80 acres of new corn as an experiment. Now, notice this. Notice the five poorest. This man had 100 acres planted with that seed, and that man had 80 acres and that man 160, and they were not yielding one-half what those other men's corn yielded right by the side of them. Now, let me show you how we rub it in, and I use that word rather carelessly here; but do you know that there is nothing effective in this world unless it comes close to us. We don't care much about that great earthquake over in Sicily. It doesn't stir us up much; and we would hardly have noticed it if it hadn't been for the one we had at home not so very long ago. But you just have an earthquake here in Nebraska and Iowa, and '.here will be some n menl al.out it. It has got to come close to us to be effective. Now look at this, forty-two bushels to the acre. I haven't got the average, but you can see what it would be. About thirty-four bushels; and this seventy - seven bushels to the acre. Side by side. Same amount of care put into growing it. That man put a whole summer on it, just as that other man II went down to the house, and rm, and found he had kept his I se, he said, he was in debt and hired man. Trying to pay off half the yield from his land he le illustration of what this me n part of this state on an avera found that he had a mortgage on wo boys out of school all summer, had to have them. He could not a mortgage and not getting more ought to. Now, let me just give ans. Your counties in the south ?e have about 80.000 acres in corn. If I could take all the corn in one county and throw out the poorest and put the best on it, I could increase it 10 bushels to the acre. That would be 800.000 bushels. If I could take the quarter poorest out and just throw it away and put in place of it this quarter fcaat, I could add the difference between the quarter best and the quarter poorest, which, on an average, has been 20 bushels on those county farms, on all these different experi - ments — twenty bushels to the acre. So you see if I could put in the quarter best I would have twenty bushels to the acre, or 1,600,000 bushels to that county. Suppose I could add just one bushel to each acre, it would make 80,000, worth $40,000. Why. what is $15,000 to your great state here when it covers all these counties? Why, I would agree to go into any one of those counties and take one or two assistants and begin this work right on heir own county farm and raise that yield three </seg>

I you could see the difference in those counties where we have had mnty experiment stations. That is one illustration. Let me go a little further, and call your attention to the work on the Franklin county farm. Now. just look for a moment at this chart. Some of my charts have been sent to me. but have not reached me; but this will illustrate. In that county we asked at least three, sometimes five, men out of (heir seed corn forty ears of the finest corn they have. Now, when they know those ears are to be planted on the county farm, lo you know they take more pains than they do when they plant it themselves. So they picked out forty ears and gave them to us. We took those ears and shelled them, put each one in a sack, and we planted ■ three kernels to the hill, some in this place, and some in another so as to get the conditions right. Now, in the fall we harvested it. in will ever know what It means until he has tried it, and finds Be'ds twenty, and another forty, and then he begins to say, You ag, I am going to pet rid of you." That is what keeps the yield down. One produces this (indicating poor ear of corn), and there are more brothi rs and sisters out there somewhere in that field that are producing al.out the same thing. A little better or a little worse. Maybe half of them better and half worse. Now, look at this. Single ears. Here is one. two, three. You see. Get them right down here ■first one, 51 bushels to the acre, and had 75 per cent, of a stand. is seventy-five out of the one hundred kernels planted. That had five, sixty-five, forty-three. " You see, there is a difference there of y bushe'.i between those two. There is forty-eight, sixty-one, twenty. Look at that here. The corn yielded twenty bushels to the acre, 35 per I of a stand. There is one thirty-seven bushels, 45 per cent. Right is one sixty-six bushels, right by the side of it. Sixty bushels, two bushels; right side by side. This one had a good stand, and &gt;ne a poor stand. And so I could go through one after another, le give you the average. Here are the five highest ones out of that forty. Look at it. An average of sixty-three bushels to the acre for the five best. This one had a stand of 85 per cent. Now, look at the five poorest ones. An average of twenty-eight bushels to the acre for five poorest ears. 4;! per rent, of a stand. This man got a low yield. He was getting a yield, on an average, of twenty-eight bushels to the acre, whin he ought to have been getting sixty or seventy bushels to the acre We used to nlant a Thousand or four or five thousand ears 5 </seg>

If these poor ears with the thousand kernels on each, or 800 kernels, that are planted in the fields grow all through the field, they reduce our yield, not only because they are poor producers, liut they put forth pollen, and fertilize our other ears, and then reduce their yield. IT, let me give you a little idea of another line of work that we are ig on. We are going to start it very soon. Our oats are not what ight to be. We are going to start out to work up some interest in We want to see about the improvement of our oats, and the jg of oats. Now, I am going to talk just a few moments more, en I will let you go. Now, I am going to illustrate two or three little things that I would like to have you people do. and help others do in your neighborhood regarding this corn, and I will have to do it in a few minutes. I wish I had an hour. Now, you readily see the point I am getting at. The great improvements must come first by improving ourselves, stirring ourselves up, get our heads into the game and do better. Now, we must il of these poor ears that are not going to produce what they ought to We can't afford to put a whole summer on it. So to do that we liy laying out our ears like this, side by side, pushing out the poorest ones and retaining the best ones, and when we have that done, we take our knives and we begin with this first ear. We have tested thousands and thousands of acres of corn, and after it is all figured up we find that it has cost the great, tremendous price of six cents an And in our home we can do it without it costing us a cent; Just a little work — and our boys and girls will take greater Interest in that corn crop next year; even it if did not increase our yield a particle they will l,e Letter boys and girls. We take these six kernels out, one out here, and one out here, and another and another, around the ear in that way. so we get a good representative sample of the ear, and we lay those down here. After we set them all taken out that way we take a l&gt;ox and put in it some sawdust. Take a gunny sack, go to the ice house and fill it with sawdust. Soak it in water over night, and in the morning squeeze the water out so it will not drip out of the box, and put the sawdust in here, pack it down until it has a smooth surface. Then take a piece of cloth like this one right here. Sometimes we make our box sixteen inches long and fourteen inches in width. Then divide ;nto squares of about two or three inches, not too small. Get good cloth. It costs twelve cents a yard. Now, then, number them, 1, 2, 3. and so on. so we will know right where each ear is. Take that cloth and spread it out on the sawdust here like that, and just tack it a little bit to each edge and corner, so it will stay to its place. Now, we set this right down here, and begin with these six kernels from this first </seg>

Don't get cheap cloth. Get il it is wet. and then spread right on top like that, and take your hand and press this down between these kernels. And take a bigger cloih than the box and spread over the ■ it here, like this. Only w&lt; iread that out here like this of that sawdust Sawdust is 1 nonconductor of heat or c generally use gunny sacks for this, and then we put in an inch or two the best thing we ever used.

You need not be wit'i your feet and pack it .« days. Ry pulling up the co 3 r here you can look at it and see how it is coming. Now. I want to say to yon when you first start at this, about 100 times a day the boys and girls will keep pulling up that corner until you will have to look out for it. because it won't have a fair show, wondering if it i« coming up. Over in Iowa there are several schools where the teachers have taken up this work of seed testing. Now the whole community is testing corn, because the boys and girls got interested, and finally the fathers came up there, and they had visitors. The next morning after I had the boys bring those ten ears I had two visitors, — the one that had the poorest ear of corn and the one that had the best. I will say to you, very confidentially, that I was glad that the man that had the best ear of corn was there at the same time the other fellow came. But we got to be better friends after - wards when he found out what it meant. Now, after about eight or nine days, when it has got along properly, take the covering off. Take hold of this cloth, and if it is gocd cloth those kernels won't gTow up through, but it will come jight off. Set it down over here. Now, I will look at No. 1 and 2. I look at No. 1. and find that there is a kernel that has not grown: and No. 2: There is a kernel there that hadn't grown. I push those down. No. 3 is pretty good. Nos. 4, 5, 6. and I keep going right through like that. And here I find one in which there are three that did not grow, and that is No. 12 — three or four at No. 12 — and I push that away down, and then as I get down </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 here, here are two that didn't grow. The others are nice, long fellows. Here is this one, two didn't grow, and three in that ear. Three hun - dred missing places from that ear. Probably the water ran down in, under the shucks Probably this end of the ear had so much moisture that it froze. Three hundred missing plates! And so I run through throwing out and pushing out the poorest ones. .lust let me show you here from this chart. Here is just a photograph that gives an illustra - tion. Here is No. 1. That is just fair; one, two, three haven't grown. Just kind of swelled up — had a little life in them. That whole ear wants throwing out. There is Na :: That is a fine one. Remember that one Four and five are pretty good. Here are some that didn't grow. They are the ones that when you go out in the spring on this Sunday morning when you are getting anxious, and you find that some of it in some places, and others places it is not. It is one of those fellows, and you go l&gt;ack and your wife wants to know how the corn is coming and you say. "Srime is a little slow, but I think it will be all right ' Here is some of those fellows ihnt are a little slow. But it isn't all right. It isn't all right. It is only half of our labor that produces anything. That ear of corn when we planted it only yielded one-half of what it ought to have yielded. Here are three that didn't grow. Here is one of the fellows that fool us. No. 11. that swell up just like some folks in this world, and they never amount to anything — just like some of these here. We put them in because it is a nice looking ear. We think. "Well. I will chance it." A thousand missing places in that field, and wasted labor, and wasted land — one-twelfth of an acre. You say it costs too much and takes too much time. It costs the great sum of six cents an acre to make these tests. Now. I can't go through with this other this time. If I do I will keep you too late. I will have me some other time and make a speech, if you think that you can stand it. This matter of testing and planting and improving is an important one, and this spring when you are going through there, and see in your box one fellow that is growing like that, strong and vigorous sprouts, and you look at that ear and you say, "That is a fine fellow." and you feel like taking off your hat to it; and any fellow that does net feel that way. is not much of a corn man. Here is a nice fine ear. Lay this ear to one side now, in this manner. These 100 ears separate them from the other, and instead of putting this other corn with the main part of your seed, you will put right into a burlap sack and hang this up — a third of a bushel in a sack; but your best seed from your 100 ears I would put this into some flour sacks like this, and hang them up, and then you would know where to get them to plant. Now when I got ready to plant in the spring I would take this down, and I would plant it in a part of the field where I could my seed from it the next fall, for like tends to produce like, you know. Early next fall, instead of waiting until it has been frozen. would go into this part of the field where the Mi ears of corn ar* </seg>
            <seg id="p133">133 planted — go in there and set out that corn and bring it in. Now. don't put it on a shelf in a box or barrel, or throw it down on the south porch and expect the women to take it upstairs, or if they don't you will on Sunday. Don't do that. Bring it in. On Saturda\ maybe at night, throw on a bushel or two from this finest part of the cornfield and bring it in. Don't go and put it in some corner. The women folks are not here, and I am safe in saying this any way. Take it into the house and lay it down in the middle of the parlor, or the midd'e of the dining room floor; in the middle. Do you know wha' will happen? Your wife will come along after supper and say.- "This isn't the place for seed corn." Now. don't get ugly.

            <seg id="p134">134 There is not a thing I ask but that you can all do. Now. just a word. The boys and the girls here and the mothers have been the people that have done this work. Over at Oskaloosa. after I was through talking. a man came up and shook hands with me. and said. "Mr. Holden. I want you to go out to supper with me." I said. "I .an't. I would like to. but I must be at Cherokee tomorrow." He said. "1 want you to see that corn field of mine," and then I knew I had to go. And we got the rig and started out. When we reached the farm a boy came out. and he said to the boy. "Charlie, open the gate: I want to show Mr. Holden our cornfield," and the boy opened the gate, and ho followed us up the road, and he came down to the oiher gate and the father said. "Hold the team. Charlie. I am going in here and show Mr. Holden the corn - field." And the boy stood there a minute and then said, "Say. pa. cant I go. too?" We never argued the matter. The boy went with us. ounted the stand of corn in his field. That boy was there following right along. I found there 98 per cent, of a perfect stand of corn. I said. "Mr. Root, how did you happen to get such a stand?" and I made up my mind that there was one farmer in that county that didn't waste his labor and land. "How did you test it?" And he kept turning around, and he would say. "Charlie, how was that?" And Charlie told him. By and by I asked him a hard question. And he became con - i. and 1 could m he didn't want to answer Finally lie said, "Mr Hi'lden. wait \intil we get down to supper. My wife, will tell you all about it." He said t lie fact was he was pretty busy, an:l the wife and looked after the testing of the corn. Come to find out. the mother had asked the boys to fix the box. and then they s;iid to their father. .nt you to help us." That is why I want your wives here, and those sisters, and the boys and girls. Those boys will be better farmers for the next sixty years — as long as they live. While I was down to the train that night, he said the thing that pleased me most Ht" said. "Mr. Holden, I am proud of that cornfield, but. that isn't what M me so much. We have had a better home than we ever had before. We have been so interested that the summer has gone and we hardly known it." I knew he had taken more interest. I n&lt;. he had been through pulling out the weeds. There were his tracks, and the boy was taking more interest in the farm. When a man will go out and test his corn and put his head into the business and study it he is interested in it every day all through the year. Not only that, but he does everything else better. Just a word, now, on the matter that ■ most important of all, and thr.t is this: The boy and the girl want to do something in the home. Too many of us fathers and mothers go ahead with our work, and say, "Oh, you never mind. I can do this." It is too much bother. And the girl grows up and doesn't know her mother, and doesn't know how to bake a loaf of bread, and the 1 oy grows up and doesn't know his father. He has got his informa - tion with other boys, and down to the blacksmith shop </seg>

And we were going to go 1 pa that we were not goin to work hard like that. Other mid go to school, and we had to stay out. We never could .get we couldn't j,et ahead, and we never would amount to anything. Finally, when we came to consider the to tell ma insi.e.;d ot pa.

We brought up chairs, one for each ot he boys, one fcr mother, and one for him, and we sat down. He =aid. Boys, 1 want you to help me plan the work for the farm." Now, there are too many of us who don't have any plan. How many of us know n the 40 or 80 acres for the next six years? We just We would have put this to clover if we had thought about it; &gt;.-e haven't the seed now. No plan, no anything. We sat there and talked, and he listened for a whole hour to our valuable advice on how to run that farm for the next year, and it was the best advice he ever had. When we got through there we just had to throw out our chests and put our thumbs in our armholes. We never men- tioned that baseball. He had asked us how to run that farm. That taik stirred us up for a whole month afterwards. We would not have had him see us shirk for the whole world. The next year he said, ■Bo\s. we have got to get together and plan and talk things over." For 1 hour he listened to our plan and our advice. When we got he took a deep breath, and said, "Boys, I haven't any criticism •x i-i t this: You may plan too much. It may rain, and you would be uraged, or perhaps you would like to see the ball game down at Palmyra Corners." We jumped up and said, "No, sir; we know we can ilo it." And we did.

We would get together and agree on the work — plan and work together— year after year. We liked our work. We loved it; and is nothing that is drudgery in this world except labor without brains. Things ran along there for thiee or four years, and my father said ooe of those mornings, 'Well, boys, your mother, and I have decided that we are going to be the girl and the boy on this farm. You have got to run it. And we stretched up another toot. We had got to run it, and he was to be the boy! And he was the best boy that was ever on that farm.

Now, just one other thing. Some of your people have done well, and some of you have already moved into town. 1 haven't anything to say to you people, because you are lost past redemption anyway. You who have not moved into town, go out and be the boy and the girl on the farm. There are so many things to be done for our boys. Help them out. show them their mistakes, and give them every opportunely; but don't criticize them. Don't move into town. You are a nuisance in io»n I Applause. J You vote against every improvement. Why, you move in there to die cheap. And then you move just outside the city limits, so you won't have to pay city taxes. You keep a Jersey cow and peddle a pint of milk here and there around the town. Then when you get that done you go down to the store and sit down there and tell • s about how much you grew on this 40 or on that So, and you add two bushels to it every time you tell it, and you keep skimping and working all your lives; and there are your neighbors, and there one that has any interest in you or cares anything about you. \\ hy. there you are. Kind of shriveled up, skimping in town. A farmer in this great state skimping! One man down here went into the meat store and asked to have five cents worth of beefsteak. I wu :ing there, waiting for a man, and this old fellow bought five cenU worth of beefsteak, and then looked around and asked the butcher to throw in a soup bone. Afier he went out, 1 said, "Who is that man?" and the butcher said, "He comes down every day and does that." I said. ' Who is he? Is he some poor old man?" He said, "No, he is worth a hundred thousand dollars, and" he said, "he moved into town, jusi outside of the city limits." How ashamed I felt that a farmer would do such a thing as that, in this great rich state. — move in there to die cheap! Where could a man live that he ought to be prouder of his work and prouder of his home than out on one of these great, splendid farms? After you have lived iliere in town "a while, a few </seg>

K Graham: Do I understand that the Revision Committee recom - that change? Seecrelary Mellor: No, sir Mr. Hervey: Now. Mr. Chairman, on this sheep classification. I don't see any necessity of doubling up breeds, distimt breeds, breeds that are improved breeds, not only by our breeders in our own state, but in the elder stales where the majority of these breeds originated, and they are in the hands of our sheepmen now as distinct breeds. I think an imposition on the man that his Leicesters should be obliged to show with Lincolns, and just the reverse with the other man. If these breeds are recognized among the breeders of sheep throughout the whole world, why not we recognize them and give these men an opportunity? Now, I know the reply to this will be, "Why, we don't have very many of them." We are not going to have any sheep at all at our state fair, if we give no more encouragement than we have been doing. Ohio — the Iowa state fair has bulit up its sheep department now until it has a respectable department, as good as many of the state fairs east, and they did it just simply by giving classification for all breeds of sheep and increasing the premiums — gave more premiums. There isn't a stock in existence that makes a greater per cent, on the investment than sheep are doing today. You will all concede that these sheepmen west of us are all getting rich. That is what you will hear. It don't make any difference whether you are a hog man or breeding stock or not. That is what one hears every day. You can't get on a train and ride as far as Grand Island or Kearney without running across some man that will talk to you about what this great sheep country is west of us: and we have got 70 per cent, of all the sheep in the United States, or west of the Missouri river, west of a line traced north and south here, with the east boundary of our state. We have got the key to th- 1 sheep breeding interest of the whole United States right here In Nebraska almost, and this country right up in front, I claim that Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 - ' LdIiAoK A ol A X B# t iUA cCL/ Or A* j it I * ' 1 . 1 I I v K . braska Is it. We are better prepared to take care of the sheep breeding interests than any other state. Sheep do well here any place except in the sandhills. They don't do well in the sand hills on account of the kind of grasses produced there, and this is bound to be a sheep producing district We are not encouraging the sheep industry a particle in this State of Nebraska. We are just simply tying a mill stone about the neck of that whole industry. Now. I say what I have to say on this We will never have sheep exhibits down here, and the breeders will all tell you that, and we are not doing anything to encourage sheep like they are doing down here in Kansas and Missouri and other places. They are organizing sheep breeders' associations. There are two strong sheep breeders' associations over in Iowa. Why is that? It is simply liecause they are fair in offering encouragement. And they have hundreds of sheep just across the river from our state, and here we haven t practically anything, and we may just as well encourage an industry, and a recognized industry throughout the whole country, and where it will be profitable to do it. and I say there is not a man who owns land here in the central or eastern part of the state of Ne - braska who cannot take hold of sheep and make money out of it, and make as mu&lt;h or more than he can out of any other kind of stock. ;i classification there for our state fair that will take in all those breeds and offer a sufficient inducement, and I will guarantee will have an exhibit that will fill your barns up until you will have to make new barns. Ohio exhibitors told me that they are coming out here and exhibiting in Iowa and down in Missouri and up at Minneapolis. They are exhibiting every place but right here in Nebraska. They are I right past us out to Iowa and through this country and making i heir shows. Mr. Hendershoi : Are you able to define the difference between -lers and Lincolns? K, Hervey: It is not necessary to define the difference. I know you are up to now on that proposition. You think there is quite ilarity between those two breeds. There is just about the same rity between them as there is between the red hog and the i-China Mr. Hendershot: .lust go back a little whei . - horses together, l&gt;ecause they are the same type and breed: same horse. R Hervey: Tlits*' sheep are not the same type nor the same ter. Not any more than you can get in any two breeds. You just as well throw them all together; throw any two together, len throw your Oxfords, your Hamshires, your Shropshires, throw all together. You can do it with just as much consistency. B Hendershot: There isn't any class legislation about this. If the iron and the French class horse are classified together, they are identical. The Shire and the Clyde are almost identical, and go and take a barn of either one and pick out the type of the two and put them in barn stalls, and no living man </seg>
            <seg id="p141">KEI'ORT OF ANNUAL MEETING. 141 Mr. Hervey: You can't do that with sheep Mr. Hendershot: If that is true of sheep, they should be together. Mr. Hervey: That is not true of the sheep. The sheep have par - licular characteristics that don't only show in their fleece, but show in the formation of the sheep, and the character of the sheep as well. You ran just as well throw Hamshires, Shropshire* and Detains and Ram bouillt ts all together. President Rudge: I would like to ask the Secretary the number of entries, the number of head of sheep and the money offered for our sheep at our last state fair. Secretary Mellor: In Lot 1, Cotswolds, we offered $140, and no en - tries. In Leicesters we offered $140, had thirteen entries. In Lincotns we had no entries. In Hamshires we had fifteen entries. In Oxfords, twenty-five. In Shropshires, fifty-seven. Southdowns twenty-six. Rani bouillets, fourteen. Discretionary, fourteen. The discretionary was classes that we have added at this time. Now we had one barn of sheep; we paid out in premiums $580 for one barn of sheep. Of course, I took the position when this Premium Revision Committee was working that that was far in excess of what we are paying for hogs, and still 1 realize that we ought to do what is right in order to get a sheep exhibit. But in relation to these Ohio men coming to Nebraska to exhibit: We can't hope to get them for this reason. They will come to Iowa. Iowa is a week before we are. Them Minnesota follows that the next week, and Wisconsin follows them. They make their circuit so as to come to Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and back into the eastern states again. They don't come to Nebraska because they don't go on farther west than Iowa, so I think the Ohio man isn't a factor in the sheep industry of our state; that is, the showing industry at our state fair. I think we ought to supply the classes that we have some show of filling, or some show of getting entries in those classes. I am not averse to retaining the Lincoln class if Mr. Hervey and the balance of ycu should think It is advisable to do so, because it doesn't cost us anything special to retain them, but, if I remember. — Was there any two years ago? A Member: Yes, sir Bcretary Mellor: There were? 1 didn't look at the books to aee many there were two years ago. The Ohio men are not bringing sters; they are bringing Detains. Mr. Hervey: In regard to those Ohio men: All I have to say is, I have got their word for it, not only at the Ohio state fair, but at the International. Not only Ohio men, but Illinois men, and men from Michigan. Now, we may just as well get these sheep breeders here as for these other states to have them. They are making the circuit, and they realize that this ought to be a good sheep country over here — ought to be a good state for them to come to. We used to have them </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 A Member: I would like to ask Mr. Hervey how we compare in premiums with surrounding states. What does Iowa pay? Mr Hendershot: How much more do they pay? Mr. Hervey: I couldn t tell you. Mr. Mickey: They give more premiums. E.Ir Hervey: They run their premiums out to three or four, I think. r, in regard to leaving the Lincolns and those other breeds on e: It don"t cost you anything to leave them on there if they don't them. It don't cost you anything, but makes the premium list look er. The more you trim down the premium list the more damage you :o the premium list before it goes to the public. Keep it in for the sarance of it, if nothing else.- Let people believe we are doing ething. Pnsident Rudge: Any remarks?

Mr. Hendershot: The Delain-Merino and the Dorsets. Mr. Hervey. Now, what have you done with the American Merinos, another type of Merino? A type just as absolutely distinct as it is pos - posible to make. Secretary Mellor: Do you wish to add them? Mr. Hervey: Now, if you have Delain-American Merino sheep exhibit - ors here, they will have to show with these Rambouillets or Delaln- Merinos, and if they show with the Detains, your Detains are absolutely knocked out. They can't show with them. They would not get a ghost of a show; and if you get your American Merinos in here and show them with the Rambouillets, there you have got two distinct types again that are just as far apart to the sheep men as you can imagine; and they can't be shown together without an injustice being done to one or the other of the owners of those sheep, or types of sheep. Now, it isn't going to cost you anything to put these American Merinos in there, and if you do you will get a great big show up in Wisconsin; and there is a man there that will show here if he gets a chance. President Rudge: Any motion? Mr. Hervey: I move that the American Merinos be shown in a class by themselves. (Seconded.) President Rudge: It has been moved and seconded.

We are cutting out this exhibit of hullfd beans, which is one of the nicest exhibits we make, and one of the most attractive.

            <seg id="p148">148 Motion to adopt report of Mr. Hervey was seconded and carried. ■ •rotary Mellor: Mr. President, I have a resolution I would like to adopted by the State Board of Agriculture: ■ krkas. The Nebraska State Board of Agriculture holds its annual id exposition the first week in September, and has been assigned ime day for the past twenty years by the National Association of Fairs and Expositions: Therefore, be it K)lred. That we respectfully request the legislature of the state raska to amend the primary law to make said primary held on rd Tuesday in August. We are asking for a resolution of that kind through all the variou I move its adoption. By motion the resolution was adopted Iesident Rudge: I think that we ought to take into consideration 11 as read to us yesterday by our Secretary relative to asking the iture for an appropriation for our new live stock show. Now, I you all understand that his bill as read yesterday — perhaps some u were not here yesterday — that it is proposed to have a bill luced asking for $125,000 to build a live stock pavilion, and $25,000 rt in on a grand stand. Mr Hervey: Before you get started on any detail work, I would like lo ask if there have been resolutions put in the hands of these other state meetings that are being held here, endorsing this bill? Secretary Mellor: Theie has not to my knowledge. I-. Hfrvey: I think that should not have been neglected. It should come forward with a very strong recommendation from every state ation here. If the allied associations of agriculture endorse the re are presen'ing to the state legislature, it will show that we are i harmony; that all of our state associations are anxious and st in the securing of these needed buildings upon the state fair ,ds. Mr Cook: Mr. President: In reading that bill yesterday, I noticed the word ■'judging." and I believe it would be a good thing to have that injeited in there, and when you speak of it, speak of it as a judging pavilion, because it gives a better idea of what it is that we want. We have already got a pavilion to house the cattle in. It is simply a large pavilion to judge the cattle in. They will conflict the two. President nudge: The Secretary will add that, I think, without any motion. I think it would read better. A Member: That doesn't change it. It read "live stock judging pavilion." B. Cook: I don't think the word "judging" is in there; as I remem - e reading yesterday, I noticed it as they went over it. Mr. "McArdle: I would like to ask if all stock is judged in this? President Rudge: Just horses and cattle. Mr. McArdle: Can't that pavilion be used for some other purpose? </seg>
            <seg id="p149">149 President Rudge: For some other purpose KMcArdle: I wili say further. I don't know but it would be a good 9 leave it the way it is. They will assume it is for stock, cattle, a good deal of money to ask this legislature just for a judging hi. $125,000. 1 think you are asking too much. Uf course, I like to get all; there is nobody here that likes to get more than do, but I would like to get something instead of asking for all and Khing. It is a gcod deal for a stock pavilion, and all stockmen in islature; and there are others that are needed as much or more Ki ground, and it is a good deal of money. One hundred twenty-five nd dollars looks big to a farmer, and I understand that there is a ture of farmers up here at the present time. Secretary Mellor: Now, Mr. McArdle, 1 will tell you why. Last ■Mr at our semiannual meeting, September, we stated we would ask for fllMM I have had a talk with a good many of the legislators along this line in the lam two weeks. One of them says to me, "How much are you going to ask for?" I said. "We are going to ask for I1M, ." He said, "What is it to be used for?" I said, "Our aim is to have a live stock judging pavilion similar to other states." The same as Indiana and Kentucky and Minnesota and other states have now, and that have cost those people $110,000 to build. The question is whether .in build this pavilion in Nebraska for the same amount of money that it was built in Indiana and Kentucky and Minnesota. Minnesota has cheap lumber, Hiut Indiana and Kentucky have better facilities for ing cheap iron and construction possibly than we have. The fact that .•mid have as good a live slock pavilion as any state in the Union, I think, is not controverted by any member of this Board. Nebraska has the third greatest number of animals of any state in the United States, and that is a good many. South Omaha is the third animal distributing center of the United States. Therefore, it is better that Nebraska should have something that she is proud of in the live stock interests. Now, it will cost, if we take up the grand stand proposition — as I said yesterday, other states are figuring to spend fUMM to $3ou,ooo on a grand stand; but I find that we can make a fireproof grand stand, a safe grand stand for our people by giving up the space under the grand stand, and filling it with earth. The proposition that I have, which is 70 by 450 feet fill would cost in the neighborhood of $5,000 for the fill, and that would relieve us of probably $30,000 of iron construction. We could cover that with cement, and then put a steel framework with a corrugated iron roof on it, and save to this association, or to the state (this is all built on state land), the amount possibly of twenty or thirty thousand dollars, h, I think, is well worth saving to the state of Nebraska. Now, this Board cannot pay to build that grand stand, even if it costs ftt without assistance, because we don't have $35,000 to spend. We really should not spend but $15,000 of the money that we now have on hand. We have got possibly $10,000 in the reserve fund, which we have laid </seg>

If all the agricultural interests that are represented here during the week that we had, realized that this binding word, the word of tying together, represents our sentiment, realized that the agricultural interests that are represented during this week that we are all intrested in the varied things because they make up the great scheme of agriculture in this state. </seg>

We have an agricultural suite, n't possibly get manufactories in — that is, on a line that would our state to any great extent, because we don't have the facility of KM iron or wood in our state, western country, and we have his morning that you kept th We have some timber up in our ihort grass there. And 1 am very one-half bushel of potatoes to the one-half bushel. It makes a fairer and more accurate exhibit; which is a little off our line, but I want to talk just a little on these lines. The northwest corner of Nebraska, in the Big Six, gentlemen, 1 am going to tell &gt;ou today, I have been there twenty-six years, now, and I can't tell you nor no other man knows what is going to be the result of agricul - ture in our Bix Six. brought about by you, gentlemen of our Agricultural Boaid to a great extent. Now, to explain. There are our counties coming down with that exhibit from Hox Butte and Dawes. Well, they come down here with this exhibit, and see your exhibit here, and it enthuaes them, and there are men coming to our state fair. Now, on potatoes: Last year we shipped out from Dawes and Sheridan counties 1,600,000 bushels potatoes'. We grow the best potatoes in the world. I want to say Minnesota is a great potato country; Colorado is a great potato country, and Colorado irrigates. Ours are grown without irrigation. Now, maca - roni wheat. Last year we shipped out through our elevators — three years ago — we shipped l,600,u00 bushels of macaroni wheat from South Dakota, and our northwest. I am just speaking of this on the agriculture there through our country. Another thing, gentlemen. I want to tell you this: The greatest thing we have done as the Board of Agriculture is our agricultural school. I believe it is seven years ago Lyons came to me and asked for an appropriation for thoroughbred seed corn. There was a board granted him $300 and provided for it.

Gentle - hat is your further pleasure? Are there any committees to report? we will proceed to the election of officers. Has any member any ions he wished to offer before we proceed to the elections? Mr. Bassett: Mr. President, I have one suggestion that I would like to make to the Secretary and Board. I have visited a number of libraries in the state during the past year whenever I had an opportunity. and I asked them what they had a'ong the line of agriculture in the library, and if they had the report of the state association. Now, we know all about those reports. We know we published them, and what is in them, and we have them in our homes, but the librarians don't know anything about it. and they say to me, "Where can I get those? We would like them." And in our work of the dairymen association I have been sending out to the library in the state — every public library — • report. Mail them out to them, and thev say. "We are glad to Ret them. You say, there is a report of the State Board of Agriculture, and State Board of Horticulture. Where can we get them?" We didn't send them out to them. There are about 150 in this state of public libraries. and they are only pleased to get them annually, but they don't know where they are. Now. the librarian is usually some young lady not conversant with these matters, and the members of the library go about their business instead of knowing that we publish 5.000 copies of this report for the benefit of the people of the state. I wanted to make that suggestion yesterday. Let the Secretary make them up: that is, send them to the librarians of the state, and do that at your own home library that is in your school, for instance, a high school, so that they have those there. They will get a better idea of what our work Is. You don't realize how valuable that report is of the State Board of Agricul - ture. There is pretty nearly everything in it. you will find if you go back </seg>

If you want to know anything about any - from 1872 on up you will find it there — rainfall, and temperatures hat has been produced, and all along the line. It Is a perfect i of information to the state It ought to be in the libraries ;hout the state. President Rudge: Is there anything else to offer? Secretary Mellor: I will state to Mr. Bassett that I have been trying to forward all those books that I get. I have not sent out to our members this year's report. I am sending U out to the farmers' insti - tutes, but there are limited number of copies I am sending this year. We have 150 farmers' institutes, and they each take twenty books, about, is the limit I have been sending them, and that is about the limit I shall send to each of the members, and the individuals and the different libraries and schools and the number that you have got to furnish the legislature and all that. I don't believe I will have over 200 hooka left as soon as that is distributed, of this MM, because there are a preat many demanded that you can't anticipate. ■ Hervey: Mr. President, has there Iwn any action taken on the you spoke of of the resolution of the endorsement by this asso - of the bill that has been prepared by the secretary? President Rudge: Yes. sir; that has been endorsed Mr. Hervey: I will prepare the resolution later.

            <seg id="p167">167 SOIL MANAGEMENT BY ALVIX KKY8ER In contemplating any system of soil management, two things must be kept constantly In view: the maintenance of the productive capacity of the land and the regular production of a saleable crop. The business of farming may be likened to manufacturing. Certain processes are carried out, raw material are changed through these processes into finished products for the purpose of sale. The farmer, like the manu - facturer, would have to go out of business if he ceased to produce a saleable product. Hence the necessity for keeping the twofold object in view. I til management, then, logically separates into two broad divisions: lanagement of the land to produce the maximum crop for the time , and the management of the land to maintain its productive Ity. Under the first division naturally falls: the maintenance and ol of the water supply in the soil, in order to make the conditions for the growth of the crop; the time for tillage and the kind of &lt;■: management of the land to prevent washing. Each crop requires its own special methods of soil preparation and soil tillage. These all aim at one fundamental principle, the control of the water supply and texture of the soil. The importance of water in the growth of a crop has already been dealt with. Bach crop requires different soil preparation and different tillage, due to the different habits of growth of the crop. But in any case the tillage is done to get and maintain the proper water supply. Thus, in the case of wheat following a small grain crop, the best practice has been found to be, to throughly double disk the stubble immediately after harvest. This accomplishes two prime objects. It produces a surface layer of loose dry soil whieh acts as a mulch, retains the water already in the soil, strengthens the rise of the film water, so that the soil will be moist and in good condition for plowing. If the stubble land is allowed to stand for some time without any treatment, the compacted surface loses water rapidly, bakes, and the soil soon becomes dry. Where the land has been double disked plowing can be done at once. The soil remains moist and retains a good texture Trash plowed under can decay and help to make available plant food materials. If the land after plowing is allowed to lie loose, as thrown up by the plow, the entire furrow slice will dry ont in a short time unless fortuitous rains should occur. Good management, then, the conditions being known, would dictate that the plow be followed by packer or disk and the spike toothed harrow to compress the lower part of the furrow slice so that capillary connection with the subsoil will be re-established and leave a loose mulch on the surface to protect the </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 supply of moisture. If these conditions are met, a moist, well firmed seed bed can be prepared at seeding time. The young crop will start off vigorously because it is well supplied with water and plant food ma - terials. Contrast the condition that exists, only too often, on Nebraska farms. The land has the crop removed and no further treatment is given umil later in the season, perhaps as late as September, when the owner suddenly conchies it is time to plow. What has taken place? The soil has baked, the compacted surface has allowed the water to escape so the soil Is dry. After the removal of the grain, weeds start up to sap the ground of its moisture and available food materials. The land is plowed in this condition. It is more or less cloddy and dry. The trash turne.l under does not rot. A seed bed is prepared with great difficulty unless the lucky rain should arrive. Seeding is done in a dry soil. . nation is poor and so is growth, because the conditions are not right. I can give you no better example than an experiment tried on -tation. the summer and fall of 1907. We desired to seed one plat I to alfalfa that fall. This series was in oats. As soon as the oats were cut, the land was double disced and plowed the later part of July. ad a rain of about '' inches while harvest was in progress. No more rain fell until September 27th. The alfalfa was seedul on this field the third week in August. Examination showed the soil to be well supplied with water. The alfalfa came up in an almost perfect stand and made good grcwth through the continued dry weather. The drouth was broken by the rain of September 27th. A rainy period of several days occurred as follows Table 1. — Rainfall September 27 1.32 mber 29 0.27 September 3u 1.41 OctoW 1 0.57 October 3 0 31 On September 28 I took samples to see how deeply the water had rated in the various fields which had been under tillage. In pasture land adjacent to the alfalfa plats the rain fall had wet the ground to a depth of 4 inches. In the stubble. 20 feet from the alfalfa, the ground was wet C inches. In a corn field, 7 inches. In an old alfalfa field, 8 inches. On land which had been plowed when dry, 8 inches. On the fall seeded alfalfa, the moisture from above had met the moisture from below On another field prepared in the same way and at the same time as the alfalfa field, although not put in crop, the moisture from above also met the moisture from below. On October 3 samples were again taken, the total rainfall up to this time being 3.88 inches. The pasture land was now wet to a depth of 12 inches. The stubble was wet down as far as samples were taken (6 feet). All the other fields were thoroughly wet at this time. It is plainly evident that if the rains had stopped at the time the first samples were taken, the stubble land and the </seg>

Yield Yield Kind of Cultivation Bushels. Bushels. Deep cultivation 59 Shallow cultivation H Shallow cultivation *9 Shallow cultivation 69 The results speak for themselves. They need no comment Frequently a heavy rain will fall producing a crust or a comparted condition of the surface soil. It has already been shown that such a condition prevents proper seration and favors rapid loss of water from the soil. Good management would dictate that a mulch be produced as quickly as possible in order to correct this condition. Every farmer can call to mind times when a "million dollar rain" has actually been detri - mental to Hip soil because it compacted the surface, favored evaporation and the translocation of the subsoil moisture, so that large lonaea occurred, which might have been prevented by some shallow surface tillage, producing a mulch On our own farm in 1906. an extra cultiva - tion under conditions very similar to those just enumerated, made an increase of F°vrn bushels of corn per acre. It is not a question whether the former can afford to do the work necessary in this sort of manage - ment but a question whether he can afford not to do it. SOIL WASHING. One of the greatest calamities which has befallen the older cultivated region of Nelfriska has been the loss of fertility and soil by the washing away of the land. In some cases this washing has gone so far as to pro - duce imnnnsp sullies. The farmer no longer farms through the gullies. They have beeeaaa so eep that he must go around. This excessive wash - ing has been due to bad management. When the rich prairie soils ware first broken the texture was loose and mellow. The soils were full ot humus, the accumulation of dead remains of the grasses in past ages. Rainfall penetrated the land easily, consequently there was little or no surfaio washing. Long cultivation with tilled crops caused this humus to be lost by decay, the result being, that the soil packed, the particles ran together readily, preventing the easy entrance of rainfall. As it roul'l no lonper flow into the soil. It ran off on the surface producing great damage. The remedy in this case is to get the land back into grass. A crop that binds the surface with its abundant roots, produce* an abundance of organic matter to form humus, thus opening up the soil, permitting more easy penetration of the rainfall. Nature tries to fill up these terrible gullies when given half a chance. I know of one field that 10 years ago had a gully through its center 10 or 12 ft. in depth. This portion of the field was entirely abandoned by the owner </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 of the land. Trees obtained a foot hold in a number of places along the pulley. Their growth retarted the flow of the water sufficiently to cause It to deposit its sediment in a large part. Today, the ditch is filled to the top and the land is being tilled where it was formerly abandoned. Deep and thorough preparation of the soil permits a larger amount of water to be caught and retained, he-nee, tends to diminish washing. Deep tillage, deep plowing In other words, and a rotation of crops that keeps the soil well supplied with humus, are the two best remedies for the control of this evil. Management of land to maintain its productive capacity, its fertility. is the most Important question on the farm. No matter how good the farmer's management may be in other departments, if he fail in this, he fails in all. By selection of good seed, by its care and proportion he may increase the yields of his crops, but he ran do as much or more by the treatment of his land. Indeed, if he does not have some excellent features in the management of the land, his yields will decrease no matter how carefully he selects his seed. Many of our very excellent advocates of good seed selection overlook this fact. It Is a well recognized principle with animal breeders, that as much care must be given to the feed box as to the breeding. The same holds true, in principle, in the growth of plant crops. I can give no better illustration than resultR obtained upon this farm. For several years past, the average yields of onr best varieties of corn did not fall far below seventy-five bushels per acre, in the regular fields. Wheat and oats illustrate the same K difference is well brought out in the following table, which the average yield of our better and poorer varieties and the for the state.

            <seg id="p171">171 I ska no rotation or a simple grain rotation is practiced. The rota - while much preferable to the continued growth of a single crop, gradually decrease the production by exhausting the humus and decreasing the availability of the mineral food materials. The rial effects of growing even one wheat crop on the land can be seen ree years at least on the older lands. But even this simple rota - 5 not generally practiced. Corn follows corn, year in and year out. esult is a regular decline in production. This is a principle that holds good in all cases so far as investigated In many cases, the difference is more and In particularly deep friable soils, the effect is frequently less. But the same results, decrease in crop production, is always apparent. One very marked example of the amount of abuse which some land will "put up with" is certainly phenominal. I am personally acquainted with a field of rich bottom land, on one of our principal small streams, which grew wheat for eighteen consecutive years and returned an average yield of over 35 bushels per acre for the entire period, including one total failure. Even this wonderful field "played out" at last and the owner of the land was compelled to change his system of cropping. Probably much of the power of this land to continue production without rotation, was due to the very excellent tillage given the land by the owner. As soon as the wheat was harvested, the grain was stacked and the land plowed, being harrowed the same half day of the plowing. The wheat was not sown until the regular seeding time. This excellent tillage allowed the stubble and trash, plowed under. sufficient time for rotting. The moisture conserved by the tillage per - mitted it all to rot. Good germination was always obtained, resulting in a good stand of strong, vigorous grain. But, the fact that the practice had to be abandoned on account of suddenly decreased production. Is sufficient argument that the system is false. Why should not one crop after another of the same kind be grown upon the land continuously without deterioration? It is hard to say. It is known that where the land supports one crop continuously, disease* and insect pests which attack that particular crop, have a chance to thoroughly infest the soil. This particular feature has become very evi - dent the past four years. Thousands of acres of corn have been destroyed by the corn root louse. This has been made possible by the continuous growing of corn without rotation. The root louse moves very slowly in its infection of the land and cannot survive over two years unless "corn fed." Putting the land in another crop for two years would therefore, temporarily check the ravages of this peat and frequent rotation would make conditions well nigh impossible for it to damage the corn crop. Bbably the different food requirements of the different crops ac - for some of the benefits of a rotation. This is well Illustrated in lowing table: </seg>

For instance, oats used 20 per cent, more phosphorus and 110 per cent, more potassium than wheat. Perhaps this is Letter shown in the form of a table in which all of these variations are reduced to a common and single unit of comparison. Let us use the nitrogen taken up by the corn crop as such a basis, calling this 100 and referring all other demands to the nitrogen demands. The table will illustrate this graphically. Table 5. Crop. Nitrogen. Phosphorus. Potassium Per Cent. Per Cent. Per Cent. Corn 100 30 83 Wheat 40 II 23 Oats 41 15 47 Barley 59 20 This table brings out quite strikingly the different draft or f&gt; demands of these crops. We have already seen that there were sufficient of these food materials present in the average soil to withstand indefinite cropping. But crops cannot take out of this store more than is made available. The different crops draw upon this supply in different ratios. so that a higher yield is maintained through rotation. These different crops send their roots to different depths. Practically all of the grain crops return less organic matter to the land than is lost by the natural decay processes in the soil, so that any system of grain farming will eventually exhaust the humus of the soil if continuously carried out To supply this organic matter to the soil again is one of the most serious questions of a rotation. Its loss from the soil favors washing, makes tillage more difficult, the fitting of a good seed bed more costly. The reduction of the humus supply also reduces the supply of nitrogen, one of the most necessary elements of plant food. One of the most valuable properties of humus is its property of combining with the mineral ele- ments of the soil, thus making them more available. It is possible to maintain the humus supply without the use of rotations, by the use of farmyard manures. We can successfully do this on the Station farm because there is enough manure produced to cover the entire land yearly A similar condition is only possible on a very few of the best stock farms of the state. To get humus back into the soil, then, under the average conditions which prevail, it is necessary to grow some crop which produces more humus than is destroyed by the natural decay processes during its growth. This can sometimes be successfully ac- complished by the growth of some quick-growing crop, as rye. to plow </seg>
            <seg id="p173">173 under for green manure. Seeding the land down to grass for a period of years, however, is much the better system to follow. Clover and alfalfa will do all that grass does and have the added quality of increasing the fertility at the same time. Land that has been broken up after being seeded down to grass, clover or alfalfa, for a period of years, is full of roots which bind together the soil, opening it up and permitting the free entrance of water and largely preventing washing. These roots, rotting in the soil, liberate large amounts of food material*, thus increasing the crop yields. The physical condition is improved so that less labor is required to prepare the land for the crop. In improving the physical condition and supplying humus, grass is slightly more effective than clover and alfalfa. But the clover and alfalfa increase the fertility to a much greater extent and the beneficial effects are ap - parent for a longer subsequent period. This is brought out by what actually happened on a Clay county farm. The land of this farm is quite uniform and except for the difference in treatment produced uniform yields. Field 1 was in timothy and clover in 1891. The field has been under cultivation since 1878. Field 2 was broken up in 1890. The two fields have been cropped continuously since. These fields were in corn in 1904-5-6 with the following yields. Table (&gt;. Yield. Field 1. Field 2. 1904 38.5 « 23 S 1906 30 10 A very excellent showing for the value of a clover crop in increasing production. Innumerable instances could be given showing the value of clover and alfalfa in building up poor or worn-out soils. Another example, near home, might clinch the importance of this crop. In 1904 a Gage county farmer having one of these run-down farms concluded to try the value of clover in renovating or restoring the fertility. He sowed clover on his wheat in the spring. The season was favorable and a good growth came on after harvest, furnishing excellent fall pasture. In 1905 one large hay crop was harvested. The second crop was plowed under as a green manure crop. In 1906 the land was put to corn, re - turning a yield of slightly over eighty bushels per acre. Adjoining fields on the same farm averaged between twenty-five and thirty bushels per acre. While many fields in the neighborhood fell below twenty-five bushels per acre. This farmer could have well afforded to have lost the use of his land for one year to obtain the improvement thus gained. The effect of the clover did not stop in 1906 but is can-led on to benefit succeeding crops. Eations. including grass and the legumes, very materially increase rtility, but they have an added advantage that is apt to be lost &gt;f. They make a very convenient place to distribute the farm es as soon as made. With grain crops occupying the land, there -tain times when it is Impossible to distribute manure. In many </seg>

Ba system of rotations, which tage of furnishing the ninsi -es.

The history of the older farming communities shows that maintenance of fertility depends upon a rotation of crops coupled with the growth of ..ek. Such a system k&lt; &lt;&gt;i the land in condition, returns food in a form which readily decays and materials removed by the crops of the crop.

Af the depression of the live stock industry. The number of cattle fell off to a remarkable extent. ;it farmers commenced to market their plant crops directly instead of indirectly through their live stock. The yields commenced to decline at once and continued to decline until the Introduction of commercial fertilizers, when they again rose to their former level. The fertilizers use.l increased enormously. About 1898 live stock began to increase in numbers. One of the results immediately manifested was a decline in the fertilizer business. This decline has continued with the increase of live stock. The yields of farm crops, on the other hand, have been maintained. ■ maintain the produc Ity of the land, then, the system of jement which is most effective includes a rotation of crops, together the growth of live stock. What sort of rotation should be practiced Iiat depends on the location of markets, local Boil and climatic con- IB. It depends on the kind of crop most in demand and best ed to the local conditions quite as much as on any scheme of malti - ng fertility. But we are most interested in the condition of the al farmer. In any case certain principles apply, their application varying to fit special cases. Thus these principles are: 1. Deep and shallow rooted crops should alternate 2. Humus-consuming and humus-producing crops should alternate. 3. Legumes should rotate with grain crops to keep up the soil nitrogen 4. A rotation which keens up the tilth should be adopted. ■ In the drier parts of the State crops should rotate so as to con - water. ■ Labor should be well distributed throughout the year and one with another. ■becomes available for the u ess of agriculture in the sta </seg>

The important thing being to change crops on the land. A definite rotation necessitates a careful laying off of fields in order to come out right with the crops. Then there is always the possible contingency of certain fields requiring a different rotatipn from the rest of the farm in order to maintain production or to prevent washing. That rotation is most successful which maintains the productive capacity of the land and permits about the same yearly acreage to be in each crop of the rotation. Matiy of our most successful farmers follow the practice of seeding down and plowing up a uniform yearly acreage or two-yearly acreage. Such a system changes the land and has the added advantage of being flexible, thus making it easier to bring up the condition of poor fields and to crop more heavily the smoother and richer fields. Finally, let us clinch one fundamental principle. The fertility may be Increased, not merely maintained, by the use of the means possible on every farm. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">177 FARM ACCOUNTS. BY EDWARi) r. BROWX, DAVET, NEB. The keeping of fairly accurate and systematic accounts has been a habit of mine while engaged in farming. I find such accounts to be of direct help and benefit, assisting me to arrive at correct conclusions as to results attained. I do not think it is desirable, or even feasable, for the average farmer to go as much into detail, especially in the direction of "cost of production," as is sometimes recommended. I make no effort to do this in my own case except so far as cost is composed of feed, repairs, machinery and supplies, besides hired labor. That is to say, I make no effort to compute the amount of labor, horse power and wear and tear of machinery expended upon the several kinds of crop or stock produced. An account which shows at the beginning of the year the amount of stock, cash, grain, supplies and equipment on hand, together with the amount received and expended during the year, and an inventory of the stock, etc.. on hand at the end of the year, shows with sufficient accuracy the general profit or loss of the year's business Such an account is very easily kept, does not require any expert knowl - edge of bookkeeping or any complicated system of books and is very satisfactory in showing results accomplished. It is far more reliable than dependence upon memory and makes possible the comparison of expenses and receipts for any number of years over which the account I sitting for the moment all reference to records that have to do the breeding of stock and the rotations of crops, the system I pursued is as follows: I keep a journal or day book in which I all items of receipt and expenditure, and a ledger, to which, from to time, the Items of the journal are transferred In systematic ac - s under the following heads: Household expenses, wages, machinery, repairs, and swine. In my own case, horses and cows have been so seldom added to the farm equipment that I keep no standing account with these departments, but merely make a notation on the annual inventory of any changes. The entrys in the ledger can well be made at any convenient time and in the ordinary course of farm business are not so numerous as to re - quire more than one hour or two for a year's bookkeeping. Of course. It is plain that if such an account shows a profit balance that profit In what the farmer has received by way of interest on his investment and salary for his efforts. If the balance shows a loss it is equally plain that the farmer has given his time and work and his investment for less than nothing. In addition to accounts of moneys received and expended, I find it highly desirable to keep other records of farm operation. Thus, I keep </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 In a convenient memorandum book notes of the date, rate of seeding, acreage, date of germination, number of hours of cultivation, amount of lime spent in harvest, threshing, and total yields for each of the ■ grown on the farm. I have found such an account of material help in permitting me to avoid the conflict which sometimes arises be - tween the different crops Brown. Thus, it is often troublesome to the farmer to harvest his first and second crops of alfalfa on account of the demands of his other crops. But a record which shows about the average date of the necessary operations for each of these crops will be found of great help in so planning the work as to take care of all without undue loss to any. To be sure, in seasons of iinu-Mi.t! weather conditions all rules fail and no experience can avoid an accumulation of several tasks at once. As an illustration of the value of the record I have last mentioned, I may say thai I once had occasion to seed a field with alfalfa, useing a broadcast grain seeder and mixing tlie alfalfa seed with bran in order to insure its running out at the proper rate. At the time I used great care to have the operation accurate, and when I had reached a proper adjustment I made a notation in my record of just how it was done: subsequently I have found that by referring to the record I could repeat this operation with great accuracy by mixing the seed and opening the feed of the seeder, as the record showed was done at first, without the trouble of going through the whole operation of adjustment each time. With seed so expensive as alfalfa it Is well worth while to know that one's operations are exact, and it is considerable trouble to have them so, but when once exactness is obtained, if a record is made of how It is obtained, it can !*&gt; easily reached in the future without further I consider a record of breeding operation absolutely essential in the management of farm stock: this record need not be complicated and need require but a few moments of time Thus, in breeding swine. I prepare a sheet of paper, ruled in vertical columns, having the following headings: Name of sow. date bred, date due to farrow, date of farrowing, number of pigs of each sex. number Io9t of each sex. total saved, date bred, remarks. This sheet I usually keep tacked to a smooth board in the ham and hanging hy it a pencil on a string. The first "three columns are. of course, entered up before the sheet is posted. Then, as the sows farrow, and rear their young, the following columns are filled up. After the record is complete and the sows are rebred the paper is removed and kept for future reference. A similar sheet la then prepared for the next farrowing season, the first three columns thereof being filled up from the preceding record. Such a record shows, at a glance, just what the performance of each sow has been: shows anything unusual or abnormal in the gestation period, or in her ability to raise and wean her litter, f have followed the practice of keeping no sow that did not wean six or more good pigs and of keeping all that did so as long as they continued to come up to this mark I have </seg>
            <seg id="p179">179 I greatly aided in this by the simple record I have mentioned. As stance of its value, I may mention that I have one sow that I several times thought I should send to market on account of her nely homely appearance, but each time a reference to my record tiown me that she heads the list in number of pigs produced and irse she has been saved, both to her advantage and to my own. As to the records of rotation, elalorate or. hi fact, anything mon grown upon the different fields in prepared a map of the farm which of each field, the fields being numtx the crop grown upon each, shows i: rotation has been followed, and, of I have never attempted anything I than a mere notation of the crops different years. I have, of course, shows the length, breadth and area red: a simple list of the fields, with pon reference to the map just what course, furnishes a guide for future It is a common saying nowaday that farming is more and more fol- lowing "business methods." The most conspicuous '"business" method followed in commercial lines is bookkeeping. The results of records kept on the farm will certainly improve farm methods. It is to be hoped that more farmers will find time to keep such, and it is believed that without doubt when they do they will discover not only many surprising facts as to the real source of their income and the nature of their expenses, but that they will also find much more Interest and pleasure in operations of which an account is kept that permits exact comparison of one year with other </seg>
            
            <seg id="p180">180 THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIVE STOCK ON THE FARM. BY E. W. HUNT, SYRACUSE, NEB. The owner of live stock should always have a definite purpose in mind, which he endeavors to subserve by keeping them. His manage - ment of them should always tend to accomplish this purpose. He should always ask himself this question: "Precisely why am I keeping these animals?" His answer to this question should be definite rather than indistinct, specific rather than general. It is not enough to say in a general way that h.e is keeping them for the purpose of making money out of them. He must go further and determine precisely in what way, and by what means he proposes to make money by them. In this com - petitive age the man who succeeds with live stock will be the man who gels the greatest product at the least expense. The old notion that "pigs is pigs" will no longer pass muster. The age of automatic farming, or farming by habit, is forever gone. The notion of keeping live stock simply because live stock has always been kept on a farm, because lire stock keeping is traditionally a part of farming, is now entirely out of date. From this time on the keeper of live stock should keep clearly in mind the precise reason why he is keeping them, and the successful live stock man will be he who most nearly accomplishes this purpose at the least expense. His entire management of them, everything that he does with them, should tend to realize his ideal. An ideal he must have, and must always work towards it. The man without an ideal should work for some one else who has one. He has no business working for himself, and will certainly fail if he tries to do so. Even an ideal is worthless unless it is persistently, continually worked for. Every man should form in his own mind a clear, definite idea of precisely what kind of horses, cattle, or hogs, or other live stock he wishes to grow, keep this idea always clearly before him, and at all times persistently work towards it. He should never change it except to improve it. The man who changes his notion of what he wants to grow, who is yearly jumping from one ideal to another, who does not work long enough at any one thing to make a definite impression, will never get anywhere. The ship arrives at its destination on the other side of the globe because the man at the helm, with the help of compass and rudder, persistently held it to its course. Had it been turned aside by false lights it would have been wrecked. So the man who Is going to improve his stock must not be lured from his ideal by any of the popular fads that ignore utility and appeal only to fancy. Nor should he imagine that his work will be easily or quickly done. He must be prepared for long, patient, constant endeavor. It is not actual attainment, but the ever-increasing desire and struggle for attainment </seg>
            <seg id="p181">181 that determines a man's value. The full attainment of his Ideal he may never see. That is the work not of one man but of generations of men. The Duthies in Scotland have worked for three generations to develop and bring to perfection the Shorthorn breed of cattle. For what they have done the world owes them an inestimable debt. But they have not yet reached their goal, with them, perfection Is yet to be attained. The ideal ol one generation is taken up by the next and pushed forward toward completion. If this course is followed long enough and intelligently enough the end will be gained. But every improvement however slight is a world benefaction. Every one may make some improvement, and thereby derive not only benefit for him - self, but add to the resources of the world at large Who would not rather be a William Duthie than a Napoleon? Every animal Is the resultant of two forces, heredity and environment, this latter term being understood to include climatic conditions, food, and care. If a man is to improve his stock, his first care should be to proceed in harmony with the laws of heredity. Heredity and en - vironment are so co-ordinated in their influence that it Is impossible to determine with certainty precisely what share of the result is due to each. But in a general sense it may be said that each animal by virtue of the laws of heredity tends to reproduce itself; or, in other words, that "like produces like." Variations from type other than those ac - counted for by the laws of heredity may generally be ascribed to a changed environment. The ordinary farmer depends entirely on the male animal for the Improvement of his stock. If this were intelligently done he would In time accomplish his purpose. But he has too often been so dazzled by the glamour that attaches to the word "pedigree" that he overlooks more important and indispensable considerations. It is not enough that an animal be "pure bred." or have an elongated pedigree. The best animals in the world are pedigreed, so also are some of the poorest. Of all scrubs the pedigreed scrub is the most hopeless. The breeder should stop buying pedigrees and begin to buy individuals. If he suc - ceeds in finding an individual with the characteristics that he desires, then, and not before, may he properly turn his attention to its pedigree All that a pedigree is worth to me, and I believe all that it is worth to any man, is to show that the points of excellence in the selected animal are the result of a long line of breeding, and are therefore prob - ably permanent and will probably be reproduced in his get If there are no points of excellence, of what use is the pedigree? Now what are the points of excellence that he should insist upon in the animal he selects? First, Conformation, or Build. The breeder should ask himself this question: "Is this animal of the type that I wish to produce?" It may occasionally happen that an animal of inferior build, through the power of the blood of better conforming ancestors, may produce animals of a good type. But this is a rare occurrence, altogether too rtre for a wise </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 breeder to place any dependence upon. It is not necessary here to detail the several points required in the good animal. The Nebraska Experi - ment Station will gladly furnish on request the score cards for draft horses, road horses, beef cattle, dairy cattle, lard hogs, bacon hogs, and sheep. These score cards set out in detail the points in which the :al animals should excel. The breeder should see to It that the animal he selects conforms as nearly as possible to the requirements of the score card. The pedigree will then show whether these excel - lencies have characterized his ancestry long enough and uniformly enough to make it probable that lie will transmit them to his offspring. If in addition to this the selected animal shows a marked masculinity of build and temperament this will indicate a prepotency to mark his get in a similar manner Secondly, Individual Performance. It not infrequently happens that an animal that answers fairly well to all the requirements above set forth fails to produce satisfactory offspring. The accidents of breeding are numerous, and cannot as yet be satisfactorily explained. Some - times an inferior animal, that is, one inferior according to all known standards of judging, will produce offspring of exceptional merit. The writer was once familiar with a herd of Herefords, at the head of which was one of the most celebrated bulls of his time. The cows were uniformly of apparently exceptional individual merit with one ex - ception. This cow had every characteristic of the pedigreed scrub. Now mark the result. Every time this cow was bred to the head of the herd she dropped a show animal, and it was impossible to get a show animal by breeding any of the other cows to the same bull, or by breeding this cow to any other bull. It was attempted to explain the circumstance by the theory of "nicking," — "they happened to nick Just right," It was said. This only names the result without explaining it. I doubt whether it can be explained. In the last analysis, individual performance is the supreme test, overshadowing all others. The obvious lesson to all breeders is: So far as possible use only tested males, males that have proved their capacity to beget the kind of animals desired. For myself, I had rather inbreed with an animal of known exceptional merit than take my chances with an untested animal. Thirdly, Assimilative Capacity. By this I mean the capacity to con - vert a minimum of food into a maximum of the desired product. Ani - mals, in other rtspects of equal merit, may differ widely as regards this inherent capacity. Some of them will consume a maximum amount of food and not show an adequate result. The feeder wonders what they do with it all. Others on a limited ration will show surprising results. Two of them fed an identical ration will show widely different results. The law of economy demands the greatest product at the least expense. Accordingly the best beef animal or the best hog is the one that will produce the greatest amount of flesh from the least food. The boat dairy cow is the one that converts the greatest proportion of her food into milk or butter fat. The best horse is the one that makes </seg>
            <seg id="p183">183 Ieatest productive use of its food. This capacity for assimilation onversion of food can be determined only by trial. It cannot tely be determined by any known means. This is the supreme eratioti, to which all others are merely contributory, of which all are merely indicative. The mhmM breeder should make It st consideration in breeding. If the breeding stock possesses this quality the law of heredity will help to perpetuate it in the offspring So much respecting thp selection of breeding male It seems strange to me that growers of stock do not generally apply the same principles to the selection of their female breeding stock. If cially by the cattle men of the northwestern part of the state. The ■beef cows are not generally as sure breeders as the culls and B. If a good cow goes farrow one year it is too frequently the practice to send her to market as a fat cow, and breed the scrubs and culls This is "killing the goose that lays the solden egg." No man that follows such a practice need hope to improve the quality of his her.!. He should invariably cull his herd from the bottom, and instead of disposing of his tops should keep and breed them The same rule applies to dairy cows. Every man that keeps a milch cow should know whether she is yielding him a profit. A scale for weighing the milk and a Babcock test for determining the amount of butter fat are indispensable for this, and are comparatively inexpensive Every dairy man should test his entire herd, and retain only the best for breeding purposes. He should milk his heifers for one nason thoroughly test them and such as are not up to his standard he should dispose of. Many men in this state are keeping cows that annually "eat their heads off." This is the worst possible economy, but to breed such cows and retain their get in the herd is to add insult to injury. How can any one expect to improve his herd as long as he follows such practices? This practice should be followed with all classes of animals. If one Ks on his native stock for female breeders, let him rigidly select e best of these for breeding purposes. By careful, intelligent selec - id constant painstaking care any one may in time produce almost any kind of an animal he chooses it is necessary to use care in the selection of the males, it is equally ■eceesary to use the same care in selecting the females. The right way of procedure would be to watch a female's performance, and if it does not come up to requirements to discard her as a breeder. If the breeder of Ixef cattle has a cow that grows poor on suckling a calf, or shrinks in flesh on fall feed and goes into the winter well shrunk, and continues rink during the winter, she should te sent io market. His purpose ia to breed animals that will take on flesh and hold it under all ordinary conditions, and he should retain as breeders those only that answer to this requirement. Unfortunately the opposite course is too frequently followed, espe- </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 Just a word to the breeders of pure-bred animals for breeding pur - poses. The first aim of every such breeder should be to bring about a general improvement of the live stock of the country, rather than the making of Immediate money through what sales he may make. There can be no general Improvement in the quality of live stock until the breeder* of pure-bred animals heartily co-operate In the effort to accomplish it. To gain this end no breeder should offer for sale for breeding purposes any but first class animals. He should not be afraid of the knife. The common grower of live stock is not yet able always to tell a good animal when he sees one. Too many buyers of stallions mistake a fat horse for a good one. A conscientious breeder will not take advantage of his cus - tomer's Ignorance, and by flaunting pedigrees more or less dependable persuade him into buying animals that should have been deprived of their procreatlve power. It is now prettv generally admitted that a seed man who sells as pedigreed, improved corn what he has selected at the common crib with a scoop shovel should be sent to the penitentiary. No intelligent man sows screenings for seed. The screenings In every breed - ers herd should be at once put out of commission. Until the common run of growers of live stock are wise enough to look beyond the pedigree to the individual, are well enough posted intelligently to make the best selection for their purposes, the conscientious breeder will assist them. and will not permit them to buy an animal that will not subserve their As stated above two influences determine the quality of an animal, heredity and environment. By environment is meant climatic conditions, food, care, and other external conditions. It Is obviously true that the more adverse climatic conditions are. the greater care must be exercised in providing adequate protection and food. If animals are to achlve the beet development. Acclimatization may help to inure them to the rigors of climate, but nothing will take the place of adequate and proper food. Generally speaking, there are two classes of foods, one for the purpose of furnishing material for bone, muscle, sinew, and nerve, the other fur - nishing the materials for body heat and energy, the surplus of which Is stored up in the form of fat. No animal can make something out of nothing, or make one class of tissue out of materials designed solely for the production of entirely different tissue. All that any animal can do is make out of its food the particular tissue for which the food is natur - ally qualified. It stands to reason that If one wishes an animal to grow he must furnish it food out of which it can make muscle, bone, sinew, and nerve, otherwise it will suffer from arrested physical development, be undersized, and lacking in physical power and stamina. Energy is needed not only for visible muscular activity, but also for every Involuntary movement, for the exercise of every physical function. Who can estimate the amount of energy used every twenty-four hours by the ordinary ani - mal is simply breathing, or by the beating of Its heart? The other bodily functions use up much more. A certain degree of heat must be constantly </seg>
            <seg id="p185">185 maintained by every animal because bodily functions can go normally forward only at such temperature. To deprive an animal of the food necessary for the production of this heat and energy is to impair every function of the body, and cause it to degenerate. Proper food in proper amount is necessary for the development of any animal, and improve - ment can be accomplished only through development. Few growers of stock understand the precise nature of the several foods they use, or use them with any adequate reference to the purpose for which they are fitted. Until they have gained this knowledge, and begin to use it, little hope is possible for improvement. This knowledge is easy to gain. The State Experiment Station furnishes to all who request it a card stating the composition of the various foods in ordinary use. Any other food may be analyzed at small expense. In scientific language, the food that makes muscle, bone, sinew, and nerve is called protein. Protein ie the growing food. The food for heat and energy la called carbohydrate. The proper proportion for the young growing ani - mal is one pound of the first to four or five pounds of the second. For the mature animal the balanced ration is about one to six. If II is d&gt; rapidly to fatten an animal, the proportion of carhohydrate food may be sightly increased. If there is to be an improvement of live stock on the farms of the state, it can come, not alone by proper breeding, but by feeding the proper kind of food in the proper proportion, and in the proper amount. The hope of accomplishing it by any other means is </seg>

EXTRACT FBOM INSTITUTE ADDRESS OF ANDREW ELLIOTT, OALT, OXT I do not speak to the man who handles a flock of pure-bred sheep, he is abundantly able to solve the sheep problems with which he comes in contact. I do not speak to the man who feeds sheep by the thousand; he is a speculator who depends more on the rise in price between buying and selling, and the price at which he can buy his feed, rather than in careful selection of his stock or economy in foods and management for his profit, but I speak to the farmer who desires to make the most of his farm as a means of bringing him a livelihood, who desires assistance in cleaning his farm of weeds and building it up in fertility. The foot of sheep is said to be golden, wherever the foot of sheep treads two blades of grass will grow where only one grew before. Kp clean the land of weeds converting that which does so much to crops and cause labor and toil to the farmer into a substantial K flock of sheep give two crops in the year, — wool and lamb. Sheep ne crops that always must be in demand and that are year by year sing in valve. Kep are the only kind of live stock that a farmer can buy In the i. giving his note at twelve months therefor, and before the note be will have obtained more for wool and lamb than will retire his aving original flock intact. Eep require inexpensive houses and are easily controlled and man- I like to speak of sheep because they have done so much for me know they will never disappoint the farmer who has trust in them ves them a chance to help him. TO GO MORE INTO DETAIL. Sheep can be handled in two ways, — by keeping a dock of breeding ewes depending on sales of wool and lambs for profit or by buying a bunch of sheep or lambs, fattening them and disposing of them when finished. The man who has his farm fenced, — and, by the way. no farmer can afford not to fence his farm, can keep a small flock of sheep at a trifling expense during summer. They will pick up their living in corners and by ways, material that would be largely a nuisance were it not eaten down: and to attend to them and daily see them grow would be a source of education and pleasure to the family. As the foundation of the flock, healthy, vigorous ewes of any or of no particular breed are all that is to be desired. In the selection of a ram, however too much care can not be given. First decide what breed is to be selected and here </seg>
            <seg id="p187">187 we have abundant room for choice. In the long wools, we have the Leicester, the Lincoln and the Cotswold. the Cheviot, a Scotch hill breed that are handsome and hardy, also belong to this class. In the fine wools we have the South Down that is preeminently the blue blooded of all the mutton breeds — the Shropshire, the Oxford, the Hampshire and he Suffolk, all of which have their admirers and their strong points; just now the Hampshire down is exceedingly popular, in the west he will bring in my judgment the biggest and best covered mutton lamb at &lt; months of any of the down breeds. The demand now is for a smaller and better covered carcas and on that account the down breeds are most desirable; they also are hardier, standing exposure better than the open wooled sheep. Iving decided what breed to follow, rams of the same breed should cured from time to time. It is a fatal mistake to charge the breed les used. If inbreeding is to be avoided a fresh ram must be ob - every two years. The cost of rams can be very much reduced by tors all breeding the same kind and exchanging rams, as a ram is ■able for from 6 to ten years. The ram should be kept separate from the flock except during the breeding season, particularly does this apply from the middle of August until the time of mateing. It is poor policy to have lambs dropping along any time during winter, t'nless extra care is given, the mo them will die from exposure and unless the ewes are very well fed the lamb becomes stunted before grass comes. Sufficient food should be given to keep the ewes in good heart keeping them in a good healthy condition until a month or so before the lambs are expected when the feed should be increased in order to bring on a supply of ni'lk for the expected young. The ewe carries her young twenty-one weeks, and when that time arrives from time of mateing the ewes should be brought home and housed every night. Extra care at this period will be well repaid by lambs saveil. I like to have a house that I can shut up at night and along one side of the house have a number of portable stalls, say 3 by 4 feet in which to put a ewe with her twin lambs for a few days until they gain strength. I want my lambs to come just so that they will be all dropped and able to follow their dams when they are turned out to grass. I have never had success in having my ewes drop their young out in the open field. Should a ewe have twins one is often weaker than the other nad she will stray away and lose one, and if lambs are weak they often fail to get a hold and suck and consequently die while if I have them under my hand all Ihese troubles are overcome. Many lambs can be saved by being on hand and assisting them to get their first drink. It is well also to remove some of the wool that surrounds the udder of the ewes in order that the lamb can the more easily get a hold. K lambs should have their tails docked and the males castrated they are ten days old. Under no condition should this be nee- </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 lected. Shortly after, within a few days of the time the ewes are shorn, the lambs should be dipped. The ticks leave the ewes at this stage and congregate on the lambs. Any of the commercial dips advertised will suit. Should there be any lice on the ewes or danger of scab infection, the ewes should be also dipped. If infested with lice great care should be given to having the dip well rubbed into hair of face and legs as here is the place where the lice do most congregate. I en the lambs are weaned, which may be any time after three i old, If pasture is good, they can be turned into the wheat stubble or into the corn fields where they will give a sood account of growing thereon. The best of the ewe lambs should be selected ept over to renew the flock. The balani-e fed and put on the t about Christmas when they always command a fancy price. In districts of Nebraska a large number of sheep could be fed om corn and wheat lands, cleaning the land of weeds and preparing it for better crops next season and giving a good return to the farmer. Mean - time, much of the wheat land as I have seen it. is left to grow weeds after the wheat is removed, this could be turned down immediately after harvest, thoroughly prepared with disk and harrow and sown to rape, either in drills or broad cast, preferably in drills. If in drills of say twenty-five or thirty inches apart, not more than two pounds of seed sown to the acre, the land could be cultivated from time to time keeping it rlian and saving the moisture for the growing plants it will even pay to thin the plants to eight or ten inches in the row. If broad cast four pounds of seed will be required. By the middle of September this rape should be well grown in either case and ready for the sheep. Rape can also be sown amongst the corn just previous to last cultiva - tion and after the corn is mature it will grow rapidly and give a big amount of fall feed. Orown in this way they are what we call catch crops, being grown on land that has already produced its usual crop. Consequently nothing can be charged against the land only the labor and cost of seed. The sheep are obtained lean from the ranges and placed upon this feed, care being exercised to accustom them to it gradually. When a load of sheep are dlsloaded from the car they are tired almost to exhaustion, and badly shaken by the continuous jar of days on the train. Put them on a bare piece of pasture where they have access to water, although hungry, they have much more need of rest than feed. Hundreds of sheep die shortly after disloading by being fed when their bodies are so tired that they cannot digest food. Gradually bring them back to a normal condition and accustom them to the rape ny degrees. Sheep occasionally die from bloating on rape but usually not many. More often die by getting cast on their back and unable to rise. They are putting on flesh rapidly, the skin Is itchy and they throw them - selves down to rut themselves and cannot find their feet. A sheep thus thrown, full of rape will sometimes die in an hour if the head is down </seg>
            <seg id="p189">189 If turned into the corn field to fatten, the rape therein will wonder - fully quicken the process of finishing and give a more Juicy and palatabl» ■MM, WHAT ARE THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY? The coyote, yes, he is a condition to be fought, that must be left to the district. Ib dog, — as long as a community prefers dogs to sheep the dog will i toll on the sheep of the country. Our legislators own dogs and ralue them more than the sheep interests of the state. There are industries, shall we call them, that are offered special protection by Kiy politic. The dog can roam over our farms frightening or worrying our flocks imperiling the lives of our children, and he is specially protected. The man with a gun can prowl around forest and hedge, marling and de - stroying the bird life that is so necessary to our success as farmers and we are helpless. He is protected. The saloon man takes our boys, our fathers and brothers, and by his seductiv? methods, turns out the finished product of his factory and flaunts his license hi our face and asks. "What are you going to do about it?" As regards the dog among our sheep. I feel inclined to take the law in my own hand and do. quietly do. what I can to abate the nuisance. In closing, let me say that I believe a bright future awaits the sheep business of the country. Wool we must have, lamb we are consuming to such an extent that the price has now gone so high that only men of independent means can afford to buy it. Our country is eminently adapted to the growing of sheep and the supply is always less than the demand. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 BY II. II. ! I TE, PANTOS. NEB Iestern Nebraska is essentially a stock country and always will l&gt;e more or less extent owing both to the considerable area of rough, land unfit for the plow and to the distance from market centers that s the transportation of bulky crops expensive. Then, of course, i the consideration that live stock is the true basis of all successful ilture. I the early days of ihe range cattle industry cattle were left to their living as baat they could on the open range and sometimes 5s was as high as 33 per cent, but as the grass cost nothing and (tie came at a low purchase price, or were grown with no expense e branding of calves and gathering the beef, there was still money proposition as a rule. Ewith the open range a thini; of the past, the land must be owned ?d and the hay-stack must be considered a necessary adjunct rn ng stock. Realizing the need and importance of a supply of forage stion arises. "What to grow?" The surest and most abundant crop is the wild hay of the valleys. The next in point of adaptability and drought resistance is cane, as It will stand during a long dry spell without burning and when the rains come grow right on from where it stopped. Cane will average four or five tons per acre where the wild hay will not average one ton. Millet Is a good forage crop, makes a good yield and I have found no objection to feeding it if cut early enough. I believe this is too far north for Kaffir and Milo maize and cane is ahead of that anyhow for this country. Then there is the corn foilder or stover, a by-product in the growing of grain. E. why do we feed? Is it noi to jirow bone and muscle, to supply heat and energy and to lay on surplus fat? In short we feed to work: either to grow as a young animal, to work as a horse or to milk as the dairy cow. The question then is what to feed to e required results. Ir a long time scientists, chemists and experimenters at our stations been studying feed composition and feeding effects. They found here were two general classes of digestible nutrients but in widely ig proportions in different crops. They also found that different s and different ages of the same classes required different propor - of these nutrients. In late years the progressive feeders and the its of agricultural schools have taken a hold of this idea and are tionizing the feeding proposition. King at a table of composition of feeding stuffs we see marked drates and protein. Fats have the same general effect as carbo- THE &lt;;UO\YIN&lt;; AND CARE OF FOKAOE CROPS. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">191 hydrates except that one pound of fat is equal to two and a quarter pounds of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, the starches and the sugars, are the elements, that burning in the body as does coal in a stove, create energy and maintain animal heat. Protein Is that element that grows bone and muscle and so is especially valuable to growing animals. Look- Ing doirn the list we find that the crops that I have named are decidedly one sided and lacking in protein. To buy bran, oil meal or tankage to supply this protein is rather expensive. Now, let us see what crop we can grow that will furnish the protein at less cost. In the list we find alfalfa has eleven percent of digestible protein so that it will make an ideal crop to balance the other feeds that we grow. Then we must grow alfalfa by all odds as it is much cheaper than buying protein. Should you by accident have a field of healthy Russian thistles by all means make hay of them as they have about seventeen percent of protein and a very high per cent of ash, the element that makes strong bone. For all crops thoro tillage as outlined in other articles is absolutely necessary to success. If you are breaking prairie, cane is a very good crop to rot the ground and makes a good crop besides. We sow cane as all other seeds that we can with a press drill using five or six pecks per acre. If sown thick it does not grow so coarse. As cane Is hard to handle and the fore part of the winters here are generally dry we do not think it worth while to stack it. Cane should be fed early because It contains so much juice that the alternate thawing and freezing sours these juices, making the feed unpalatable and destroying its food value. We run it into large bunches with a sweep and top with a fork. For quick handling at least expense we use what is known here as the "push stacker" but in Colorado is known as the North Park stacker. With this stacker which is nothing but an inclined plane, we can stack one hundred and twenty-five tons per day if we have enough sweeps to get the hay to it. We stack our hay as green as we can handle it to advantage and it is surprising to many, how green wild hay and alfalfa can be stacked if there is no outside moisture as rain or dew. It cornea out of the stack in the winter green and nice. It is especially important ihat alfalfa be stacked as green as possible with as little rain as possible, for the leaves, the most valuable part of the plant, shatter so easily. We rake alfalfa just as soon as it Is wilted and allow to cure in the winrow till wilted and the sweep will pick it up. Io much care cannot be given in the preparation of a seed bed and ially is this true of sowing alfalfa. Never sow on freshly plowed and it is too difficult to get the subsoil thoroly packed. Corn stalk well disked is about as good as any unless you are where it is so hat it will be necessary to summer till in order to be sure of enough ure to br^ng the alfalfa up nicely. In the western part of the I doubt If fall plowing will be uniformly successful unless you are • irrigation. Sow about twenty pounds of clean seed per acre wlth - , nurse crop.

The new growth of alfalfa must come from 3wn and there is no crown till alfalfa has bloomed once. In this iany a promising stand has been killed. ■ the old days, when hay was worth a dollar and a half or two dol - niore or less waste made no particular difference, but with the jrice of hay and the cultivated crops this waste must receive careful ion. In prairie hay and the weather dry feeding on the grass is prob - i good a way as any, but there are calves and other stuff to feed corrals and racks must be provided for them. With alfalfa feed - the ground is too wasteful as the leaves, the most valuable part, .ttered and lost. The old wasteful method of turning to stacks or i large bunches must cease in the interest of economy. Brome grass, while not a hay grass, has a place here to take the place of forage crops. At the North Platte substation two-year-old steers lost nineteen pounds in weight during the month of April; that is after the cattle would refuse wild hay and after the black root has started, bat there was not sufficient grass to keep up weight. Alfalfa hay may be used to good advantage as cattle will eat that after they will refuse other forage crops. But brome grass starts very early and if a field of that was at hand it would furnish pasture long before the native grasses and help to piece out between the hay and grass period. Brome, too, would furnish some late pasture to recruit the cows after the calves have been weaned thus allowing them to go Into the winter in better </seg>

HOOUE, c m The subject of seed corn is of far more importance to the farmer than is generally supposed when we stop to consider that a difference of five or ten bushels and cften more per acre is the result of the selection of good or poor seed. First every farmer should select a variety of corn as large as will mature in ordinary seasons in his locality. The old belief that corn runs out an&lt;I the seed must be renewed by sending away for it is a mistake, however. If you find it necessary to procure seed purchase it in your own locality if possible, if not get it as near your locality as possible. Corn does not run out but the longer it is grown in one place if properly selected and cultivated the better. After ■elect - ing the variety adapted to your location, improve it by keeping your land I high state of cultivation by clover or alfalfa with a &lt;-oat 1 manure cannot be had clov lere in the corn 1 elt. As the lelection we will not go into ecting seed corn go into the 11 and pick the eirs that nan? rotation of crops which includes the of manure at least once in five yean. er always can, because it will grow intention of this article is to treat of detail concerning the growth of corn. field as soon as the corn is hard in about three feet from the ground on a good stout stalk. Do not pick the largest green ears or the smallest ripe ones but a medium sized ear fairly well ripened, with a good shank, straight rows and as near the right color as possible. Pick three or four times as many as you will need leaving enough husk on them to tie together and hang up on a wire or anything convenient, providing the place will keep dry and have free circulation of air. It must not be hung over livestock, hay or grain. If corn is well ripened and kept dry it will not be injured by freezing, but if it is stored where it will gather moisture then allowed to frs— 8 it will not grow. In the spring, two or three weeks before planting time take all of the seed corn clown, remove the husks and by sorting care - fully select the best third for planting, discarding the remainder. The corn sjiould be tested before planting. There are many ways of doing this. One is to make a box of one-half inch lumber about 30 inches square and as deep as a lath is wide: divide this one way by setting a lath on edge about 1 Vi inches apart, then draw a line with a pencil crosswise on the top edge of the lath, making 1'4 inch squares. These squares should be numbered as well as each ear of corn that is to be tested. To number the ears write the number on a small stick and insert at the butt end of the ear. Then fill the box with dirt or sand and take two kernels from each numbered ear and place them in the squares bearing the corresponding number. Place a heavy cloth over 7 </seg>

If any of it does not show good vigorous sprout, discard the ear having the corresponding number and by so doing you can have a perfect stand of corn. The box above mentioned will l:e large enough to test corn enough at one time to plant al out thirty acres, and the time spent in following the above plan will If well paid for at harvest time. </seg>

Specific directions to be followed in gr&lt;&gt; potatoe-i for Richardson county would not be applicable to successful pMato culture in Box Butte county. However, directions covering some of the operations in producing the potato crop can be followed no ma'ter in what locality the potatoes are to be grown. In selecting the seed, the size, quality, variety, and freedom from disease and the treatment f. r disease would be essentially the same for potatoes planted in any pan of the state. There would, however, be a difference due to the loca'iiy in which the seal was grown, since we have i-ome to consider noit hern-grown seed lest for general planting. This impression may siirft-r a change if experiments of the Horticultural Department rn mulch - ing po aloes for seed purposes, continue to give such striking results. Kor the last four years at the Nebraska Experiment Station Professor r-nn finds that potatoes grown under a mulch the previous year ■ t cent, higher yield than the same variety grown by methods of cu'tivaticn. If mulching potatoes for seed purposes can be made i able on a larger scale, the professor has made a valuable dis - covery. Them is no reason why the average farmer cou'.d not pi I this method of producing seed for his own use. The chief reason for the : ior quality of seed grown under mulch is likely due to the fact that more uniform conditions and cooler temperature of soil are main tatead dr. ring the growing season of the crop. It is generally consv that thorough cultivation is best for potatoes grown anywhere in NV I raska but this may not hold in the production of potatoes for seed Iie following table shows records on ten coiinlies. taUen from the report of the State Bureau of Labor and Statistics.

            <seg id="p197">197 The Commissioner of Labor secured the above figures from county assessors, so that they can be relied upon as accurate. The potatoes were figured at 70 cents per bushel. The writer recently consulted the buyer for one of the large wholesale houses in Lincoln who stated that the average wholesale price paid for potatoes during the year of 1908 was above 75 per cent per bushel. Experienced potato growers usually figure that it cost about $32.00 an acre to produce a crop of potatoes. Taking the smallest yield per acre, that of Box Butte county, which wa» (8 bushels, figuring at 70 cents per bushel and deducting $32.00 per acre for cost of production, the grower still has a profit of $15.60. which compares favorably with that of other crops produced on the farm. The Of production in the western part of the state, where land is cheaper would be considerably less than the above figures, and on some lands in the eastern portion of the state, like those, of Douglas county, the cost per acre would perhaps be more than the figures given. The northern and northwestern portion of Nebraska is better adapted, by virtue of her light soil and cooler nights, to the production of higher quality tubers than the southern and southeastern portion of the state where the soils are heavier and the nights warmer. —The following statement from T. G. Fergusons lecture on potatoes perhaps agrees with most of the experiences of the larger potato growers of the state: 'Early Ohios are l&gt;est adapted to general planting in Nebraska and seed of this variety procured from the Red River Valley of the North nearly doubles the yield and can be procured from Glydon, Minn., at digging time and laid down anywhere in Ne - braska some years at the same price that home grown potatoes selt for. There are hundreds of thousands of bushels raised yearly known as the Red River Ohio and are distributed all over this country for seed purposes. Where irrigation is practical, such varieties as Rural New Yorkers. Sir Walter Raleigh and the Carmans are best and produce immense crops. Seed of these should be procured from the muck or heavy lands of Michigan or Wisconsin. The seed should be cut imme - diately before planting. I'se single-eye pieces and plant in moist soil about thirteen inches apart, covering about four inches deep." Br. Ferguson, who was one of Nebraska's largest potato growers and experimented extensively with numerous varieties and various ids of cultivation, can be relied upon as authority. He prepared round by deep plowing and used the planter, generally an "Aspln - on account of the large acreage grown. •ml. — other conditions I eing equal, the light soil is always preferable for potato growing Light soils usually contain a large percentage of sand, which as a rule tends to make them light in color, but some ideal potato soi!s are very black. A great deal depends on the rotation or preceding crops which were grown upon the soil before it was planted to potatoes. It is better to precede a potato crop with a crop which frees the ground of weeds and has a tendency to leave the soil loose. </seg>

The chemists tell us that S2^ per cent is water and wa-ste matter, and that over 15 per cent of the remaining 17V4 per cent is starch. Perhaps the fact that potatoes are rich in starch accounts for their playing so important a part in the daily food of man. They help balance the ration with meats, milk, and beans. Probably no other crop is so generally grown and generally used as a food product. It is likely that no cheaper substitute will lessen the demand for potatoes, but unless some serious consideration be given to the problems of potato growing the price will be almost prohibitive. ■ clipping from the Lincoln Evening News. May 3, makes a state - ill out jKitatoes shipped into Nebraska from Europe as follows: "Potatoes grown in Europe are being shipped into Nebraska to supply the unusual demand caused by shortage in the domestic crop last year. The first carload of them to reach Lincoln was received by a wholesale firm last week. This consignment is now being distributed to the ly trade of the city and its territory. The tubers were raised in the British Isles. They are smooth, hard and firm in quality, but not so large or of such light color as the varieties produced in Nebraska and Colorado. 'The foreign potatoes are expected to keep coming, as they can be had laid down here at a price In to 15 cents per bushel lower than the Colorado article, which is about the only source of home supply at this time. They first appeared in the New York market several weeks ago, which time importations have continued steadily. The eastern market absorbed the first shipments, and now the potato raising section of the middle west is beginning io buy and consume the European grown spuds bMMto it has not enough left on hand from the 1908 crop to last until the new harvest. Last fall potatoes were sold in Lincoln as cheap as 60 cents per bushel retail. Today they command more than double that price at wholesale. Any dealer foresighted enough to buy Jarful in October and keep them until the present time could have made 100 per cent on his outlay, after allowing for loss through rotting and other causes. For the European product, the wholesalers now charge $1.25. and the retailer sells to his customers at $1.45 and </seg>
            <seg id="p201">201 $1.50. Colorado potatoes bring $1.35 wholesale and $1.50 to $1.60 in the grocery stores. "There was not an actual shortage in the potato crop of Nebraska last year, but a large proportion of the state's production was shipped out during the fail and early winter. High prices in the central markets attracted the larger part of (he reserve supply held in Nebraska, until it 1 ef»me evident a month or six weeks ago that the stock needed for home consumption had run low. The demand for seed potatoes accentu - ated the situation and boosted prii-es to a figure where it became profit - able to import. The duties collected on .such shipments in New York on one day recently amounted to $20,000 "It has been a good many years sime any tul&gt;ers from Europe were sold in Nebraska. That happened formerly when the home crop was very short, as in the drouth seasons of 1894 and 1895. The Dingley tariff law placed a duty of 2"&gt; cents per bushel on potatoes, which had the effect of barring them out. except at times when the home price rose to an abnormal level, as at present. The freight rate on potatoes from New York to Lincoln is 30 cents a bushel. This double handicap has always kept them out of the western market heretofore, but with the price away up in the clouds they can now be brought in and sold at a good profit El potatoes shipped in last week This does not correspond to two and a half bushels in each nds.

This would be more than eight bushels to every inhabitant of the state, so that the home supply would have been more than abundant had not so many tubers been shipped out." The above statement from the Kvenine News contains figures and suggestions of much value to those concerned in the production of potatoes in Nebraska We have nn quarrel to pick with our competitors across the water, but Nebraska with her favorable soil and climatic conditions should produce a sufficient number of potatoes to supply her own consumption Our dealers should stand ready to handle more of Nebraska's &gt;-rop at harvest time This is another striking example nt a lack of proper organization between producers and consumers It is even worse than the condition so often prevailing among the tenant farmers of our state who haul their corn to the elevator at 40 cent? per bushel in the fall and buy the same corn back at 60 cents per bushel tn the spring. This happens because the farmer does not keep records and fails to estimate the number of bushels of corn required to keep his stock until the new crop Is ready for harvest. </seg>

HAWTHOKXE There are. in the floral world, ir.any plants in which the nectar is very abundant and of the richest quality, which cannot properly be spoken of as hcney producing plants. In order for a specimen to come under this specification it must comply with three requirements: First — It must of course contain and produce nectar, for from half-digested nectar honey is made. Second — The nectar must not only be of such a quality as to attract the bees, but it must be of sufficient quantity to make it worth while for them to visit it. Third — The corolla of the flower must be so formed that bers may have easy and unimpeded access to the sweets contained therein. Some flowers meet the first two requirements for honey-producing plants but the nectar is secreted far down in the bottom of a long, funnel-shaped corolla. The tongue of the honey bee is very short, so in such a flower it is impossible for it to reach so ffir and if the funnel is small the bee will not venture entering, for it is difficult to back out. Thf-n- is a variety of common red clover which contains so much sweet nectar that it scents the air all about it, but the tiny corolla is too deep for the tame honey bee, so its sweets are "wasted on the desert air" or else gathered by humble bees, wasps and tiny insects. It is a peculiar thing that, while most plants offer every inducement to the honey bee, th«-y make it very undesirable for insects, such as ants and spiders, to steal their riches. Numbers of plants have a sticky substance Just beneath the blossom and along the stem so that insects cannot mount. Others have small hairs around the throat of the corolla and some others emit an offensive odor. But most flowers that have honey in them at all so arrange things that honey bees may be induced to visit them. Most such plants smell very sweet — in this class are the honeysuckle, sweet clover, fruit blos - soms, alfalfa, etc Or if the odor is not noticeable they have very bright • olois — note the bright yellow of the goldrenrod, the delicate pink of the heartsease and the contrasting white of white clover. But as much as the flowers help the bees, the bees aid the flowers by tarrying their pollpn from flower t« flower and thus fertilizing them. The tody of the honey liee is covered with fine hairs, so tiny as to seem like fur. When a bee enters a flower, this furry coat catches a great deal of the dry pollen and then Mt. Bee. or Miss Bee, rather (for all working bees are females I. flits from flower to flower and unconsciously polinates them. Rome flowers grow so abundantly that bees will work on them almost or quite exclusive of all others. This gives the honey a characteristic </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 Kand taste so it is named for the particular flower from which it ie. This is usually the case with members of the clover family, is the white and red clover, sweet ciover and alfalfa, also with ease, basswood and golden rod. But besides these plants, for whi&lt;-h the honey is named, there are about two hundred different flowers which are honey producing In a more or less degree and without which there would be but little honey made. Among thore plants which contribute to honey manufacture somewhat may lie mentioned about twenty-five varieties of the mint family, flax, most all fruit blossoms, several compositae flowers and the blossoms of vegetables. </seg>
            <seg id="p209">209 HOXKY I'KOIHCIN*; PLANTS BY JOSIE V. WBIOHT There are in the world of flowers a great many different kinds of honey-producing plants. God sought to please the taste as well as the and therefore made many different plants, each with a different taste, for the honey bee to gather into the storehouse for man's use. Perhaps the most prominent of the varieties which, by reason of their ness, bees will leave all other plants and work on them exclusively is alfalfa, common red and white clover, buckwheat, basswooil and the wild goldenrod. When honey is made of these plants separately the honey takes on a distinct taste of the plant, thus making several dif - ferent flavored honey in the same season. There are somewhere about two or two hundred and fifty different honey-producing plants — in fact, a large majority of the flowering plants are honey-producing. Not alone do the flowers help and provide for the bees, but the bees are a great source of aid to the flowers by carrying their pollen from one flower to another and thus fertilizing them. There is also another way in which the bees carry the pollen and that Is by the fine hairs with which the body of the bee is covered. </seg>

The winter wheat should be sown early enough in the fall to allow it to get sufficient growth to cover the ground before winter. This usually means seeding from September 1 to In It may be that from August 15 to September 1 is a better time. It is seldom that late seeding gives large yields. I have not seen too much growth in the fall but have frequently seen too little — almost always too little. The time for seeding in the spring depends on the weather. It Is usually safe to sow any of the common spring grains as soon as the soil can be worked. This would usually be sowing after Man-h 25. We have lost by freezing stands of oats and of barley seeded at a later date than this, but such a loss is unusual. It is a good plan to prepare the land for all the grain and then concentrate all the labor on the seeding when the weather seems favorable.

Durum or winter wheat are worth more, pound for pound, than corn, for feeding to stock, if ground, where alfalfa is r.ot fed. Barley and emmer are also good feeds for horses and cattle, and fairly satisfactory for hogs. There is no reason why grains cannot take the piece of corn where they can be grown and the corn cannot. A systematic crop rotation should be practiced on every farm. No field should be planted to corn or to wheat year after year. Corn or any other intertilled crop should prepare the soil for a small grain crop. Winter wheat should be grown over a larger area and on more farms. It should le grown on summer tilled land. More forage should be pro - duced in order that bet'er use may be made of the pasture land which </seg>
            <seg id="p221">221 rannot be tilled. Cane sowed broadcast or cane or kafir corn sowed in rows and cultivated, are the most profitable annual forage crops The following five-year rotation is given as one that may serve as an example and also be applicable to many farms: Summer tillage, followed by winter wheat The wheat stubble fall plowed and listed into corn. The corn-stalks disced early in the spring and spring grains — oats, barley and spelts, drilled in. The grain stubble fall plowed, disced m the spring and drilled into cane for forage. This rotation will require five fields and will give a crop of winter wheat, rorn, spring grain and forage each year. Where corn cannot be grown, cane or kafir rorn may be planted in rows and tilled in place of the corn. The fertility should be kept up by applying barnyard manure or I y having a sixth field which will be growing alfalfa or grass while the others are in annual crop. After a few years, this field can be put into fhe rotation and one of the others seeded down. The forage should all be consumed on the farm and usually all of the grain. Occasionally some grain, as winter wheat, may become so hiph priced thit the farmer can afford to haul it to the elevator, but the farmers who have succeeded are those who have hauled hogs and buttir. rather than grain, to market. There should be some alfalfa grown on every farm, for hog pasture. and for forage for young stock. Nothing else will quite take its place. It may be that it can be produced most profitably by growing it in rows and cultivating it. but It should be grown in some manner. Crop grow - ing and stock raising should be evenly balanced on the farms on the table land. In the sand hills, the growing of stock should be the prominent part of the farming business. There is an abundance of summer pasture but usually little native sustenance for the winter. Only the valleys should be tilled and these only to produce forage and grain to carry the sto-k through the winter. Alfalfa and brome grass should be tried pers'stently. Sweet clover should be given a trial as it may grow where the alfalfa will not catch, and will build up the soil wherever it grows. If cut when it is young, it makes a fairly palatable forage and in a manner takes the place of alfalfa. The sand hills cannot be farmed profitably unless the best use is made of the native grass and of the crops grown. The proportion of tilled land to pasture land should be very small. Grain should never be hauled away from this land, as the soil will not permit of any robbing. T*ie man coming in without capital will be obliged to depend larrely on chickens and dairy cows until he can collect a herd of stock.

            <seg id="p224">224 (1OOL) ROADS ADVANCEMENT. BY F. W. CHASE, PAWXEE CITY. Since the advent of man the question of good roads has been and always will be one of the great fundamental principles of progressive industry. Good roads are one of the principal factors which indicate an enterprising and prosperous community. In fact no rural community can be up-to-date without a good road. It has been well said that ssity is the mother of invention" and necessity certainly demands a good, solid, well rounded, smooth, road bed. Such a road makes cheap hauling, stimulates an easier and freer movement of teams, thus making a great saving of time and by saving time a great saving in mon.y A few travel for pleasure but the rank and file travel for business, some hauling heavy loads and some skipping along with light like the doctors, rural mail carriers, agents and others. Kp problem of building good roads and keeping them in good repair the least possible expenditure of labor and money is one that study and thought, coupled with a large experience. It is clear that road capacity must be increased as the country or town develops. At the beginning of the colonial period of our country the only mode of transportation for all kinds of merchandise was by horsel.ack. Then the only road was a narrow and crooked lane through heavy timber. Such was all that the necessities of the traffic required and in some places the travel was so meager that no trace even of a* path could be found except by trees marked to show the lone traveler his whereabouts. But as the settlements grew thicker a two-wheeled vehicle, called the "one-horse shay." was introduced and at about the same time the ox-cart also came into use. At this period the idea of defraying the expense of road building by taxation seems not to have been thought of and the only progress in road improvement was by public-spirited citizens. Later, companies were formed and capitalized for the purpose of building a line of road. Such companies put up at the ends of these roads, gates, called " toll-gates, and the people were charged a certain amount of toll for the privilege of traveling along the highways. This toll was collected by a gatekeeper who resided In a little house built in connection with the gate. When travelers approached they were required to pay to the keeper the sum charged as toll before the gates were opened. As the country became closely settled and towns and villages sprung up. taxes, to defray the expense of road building and repairing were raised and gradually these toll-gate roads were brought up, either by the state or county, or disposed of in some other manner and were opened up free of charge to the traveling bll </seg>
            <seg id="p225">225 GOOD ROADS ADVANCEMBNT Prom the time of the one-horse shay or ox-cart, year by year, aa our Bhas become settled and the population and wealth have increased iderfully, there has been a constant and growing demand for roads, until now, with the great amount of heavy hauling, the ;s, the rural mail service, and the automobile, the demand for a a more solid and smooth, oval-surfa&gt;e road is more in evidence than ever before. How can the greatest amount of good be done for our roads with the funds that are appropriated for road work? This is a question or problem that is hard to solve. Law-makers have tried to introduce new Ids. county commissioners have searched for new ideas, the pre - roail i«iss has done his best, but none has reached such results as Mild have liked. Perfection in road building and repairing can - 11 be brought about at once, or in one year or two. Human ingenuity was taxed for years to make a successful sewing machine and Eirue of tli&gt;» ponderous steam engine and a thousand other lical and engineering accomplishments. Little by little new ideas worked their way into the mechanisms of these wonderful les and so it is with road building. As the years go by we find rv demands an made of our roads and so in the same ratio will our roads have to be improved to meet the demands. (f a man fifty years ago had even suggested such an idea as a free delivery postman tor the rural district* he would have been considered a visionary, but such a thing has come to pass, and now very few farmers in our great and beautiful state are so located that they are not receiving their daily mail at the front door of their homes every he daily mail has come a still greater demand for morning good road Our road makers already see the necessity of using the road fund I &gt;ke lasting and permanent improvements.

The introduction of new insects from a foreign country, or even from distant parts of the same country, is often very apt to result in injury to some one or more crops or to other interests belonging to the region thus affected. Every insect, in its long-established home, haa ita natural entmies, predaceous and parasitic, by means of which it is held in check sufficiently close to prevent it from doing at most more than a moderate amount of harm* Should such innocuous insects be carried intentionally or otherwise to a region distantly removed from where their enemies are found and climatic conditions still remain favorable, they very quickly increase with such rapidity as to become pests. This is a well established rule; and when such introductions happen to be species that are naturally hardy and at the same time capable of feed - ing upon or adapting themselves to an extended list of food plants, the dangers are many times increased. 11 examples of the introduction of such insect pests we have many ices — some of them of long standing, but others only recent iK these are such noted ones as the Hessian fly. Codling moth, San scale. House fly. Gypsy moth. Brown-tail moth and Rape butterfly, with two of these imported pests— the Gypsy moth and Brown-tall —that the present paper deals. While eastern papers have been full of accounts of both the Brown - tail and Gypsy moths for several years, it never occurred to the west - ern readers of these papers that the slightest danger existed of their t&gt;ein£ introduced into regions west of the New England states. Since the first of the present year, however, the occasion for alarm has come in connection with both species. Early in January the inspectors at New York City discovered numbers of winter nests of the Brown-tail moth among shipments of nursery stock that were arriving in this country from near Angiers. France. At least 1.000 cases of such nursery stock were known to be arriving in the country for various nurserymen throughout the I'nited States. Notices were accordingly at once mailed to the entomologists of the various states so as to put them on their guard and thereby prevent, if possible, a general spread of the pest. Een inspecting some of this imported stock in Ohio recently for tail moths one of the inspectors of that state came across a cluster isy moth eggs, showing that this insect also is again being Intro- •In other words, the species is held at "normal" — usually a point where no appreciable ill effect is produced or noticeable. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 dined from Europe — this lime into territory west of the Ohio river — a long way beyond where it has been known heretofore. On March 29, 1909. four of the winter webs of the Brown-tail moth containing several hundreds of living caterpillars were found by the present writer on imported nursery stock here in Nebraska. It is quite probable that some of these iusects may escape detection and thereby become established in nurseries or orchards within the state. Some foreign-grown nursery I reaches both our nurserymen and fruit growers indirectly and therefore escapes direct inspection. In order to provide protection against this possible indirect importation the present paper is prepared. As may be observed by the accompanying illustrations, the Brown-tail moth Ituproctia vhrysorrhea L.I is most apt to be introduced in the very .-mall caterpillar stage. In this form it occurs hidden away in the winter webs. These webs are usually fairly conspicuous and hence readily detected; but occasionally the webs are rather small and so tucked away in crotches of branches or among the twigs that they are less easily A single web thus passed by during inspection is apt to contain from fifty to three or four hundred caterpillars which when grown may develop into that number of moths, one-half of which are apt to be females with an egg-laying capacity of several hundreds each. Once introduced and established in a region constant vigilance would be necessary to destroy and prevent its spread into new localities. Kthe other hand, the Gypsy moth (Prothctria dispar L.) is more apt ■h us in the egg state — a mass of which is shown in the accom - g illustration. These egg-clusters are tucked away in all kinds of and crannies, as for example, in crevices of bark, between twigs, npled leaves, among packing, etc. Ishing to obtain a little recent authoritative information regarding two insects, the writer recently corresponded with the U. S. ento - si. who asked one of his men in charge of the work in Massa - ts to reply. The following quotation from this letter will give jnt data to satisfy the most fastidious as to the dangerous nature of este: "The Brown-tail moth does not commonly kill the trees upon which the caterpillars feed, but the stripping of the leaves from fruit trees leaves the fruit exposed so that it either drops off or is burned by the sun so that it is of no use. I have seen forest trees supposed to have been killed by the Brown-tail moth, but their appearance is not common. It Is, however, a serious pest to humanity, the poisonous hairs from the 'i liars causing an itching rash. During the season when the cater - pillars feed, clothing hung out to dry, particularly underclothing, catches the hairs, and when put on the body is affected all over. There are occasionally people who are immune from this rash, just as some are immune from poison ivy or oak. I think the particular financial damage is the effect upon the value of real estate infested by the Brown-tail moth. </seg>

With the above array of facts before us I believe there is no need of my adding still others to convince Nebraskans that we do not wish to add these pests to our already long list. When unpacking nursery stock in which there is the least danger of finding either of these insects, it is necessary to make a careful "tree-to - tree" inspection. This can be done quite rapidly by passing .the trees through the hands of three or five or six persons who are known to be good observers. By so doing there is little chance of missing the detection of either winter nests of the Brown-tail or egg masses of the Gypsy moths The packing — moss, excelsior, chaff, straw, leaves, paper, etc.. should then be carefully removed from the boxes, gathered, and burned immediately, or as quickly as the weather conditions will permit.

SWENK Farmers are frequently annoyed to find that apparently good seed falls to come up after planting, generally over so large an area of the field that a partial or sometimes even a complete replanting is made necessary. Investigation in the majority of such cases will reveal that this failure of the plants to appear, if other conditions are usual, is due to the attack of subterranean insects upon the seed. The piesent paper is intended to discuss briefly the more important insects concerned in this destructive work, and has largely been inspired by the discovery of a new peat of this sort in southwestern Nebraska, which is here for the first lime dis - cussed in connection with such injuries. Our attention was first drawn to this new pest in a letter received from Mr. C. E. Hopping, a prominent citizen and druggist of Beaver City, Nebraska, under date of September 22, 1908, in which he stated that by separate mail he was sending a larva which had been found destroying planted wheat in that vicinity before it could germinate, and requested information regarding the identity and means of control of the insect. Professor Bruner in reply ventured the opinion that the larva was that of one of our Tenebrionid beetles, probably one allied to Eleode*. but that as it was an entirely new addition to our list of planted seed pests it would be impossible to suggest a reliable remedy at once; he suggested, however, that if the larvae were prevalent and the damage serious so as to warrant further investigation, such would be taken up at once. Mr. Hopping's reply was to the effect that the larvae were abundant in the wheat fields north of town, three or four of them to the foot in the drill rows, and in two fields he knew of were doing a great deal of damage, so much so that it would be impossible to obtain a stand of wheat; he con - sidered the situation well worth investigating, and accordingly on the 29th of September the writer visited the locality to look up the situation. He first visited the farm of Mr. W. N. Hewett, three miles north of town, where the larvae had been originally discovered and reported on. This field had been in corn the previous year. The larvae were found abund - antly in every part of the field, and about 60% of the planted seej, judging from several hundred kernels collected in the drill rows, had been gnawed and devoured so that it could never germinate. Many kernels were almost completely eaten up. As Mr. Hopping had written, four or five of these larvae were to be found in every foot of the drill row, and in a half hour forty or more of them were picked up. Another field planted in ground just broken from sod was almost as severely infested. </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 In still another field growing up to volunteer wheat the larvae were present abundantly. In fact the situation seemed to be general in all the fields over the whole region, extending at least over the southern half of Furnas county, as over a dozen farmers of the vicinity with whom the writer spoke testified that their fields were infested similarly to those examined. One field of 90 acres in fall wheat had to have 40 acres completely resown. At the prevailing price of wheat this was so serious an item that some of the oldest wheat growers would not replant wheat, but decided to allow the ground to lay until they could plant corn in tne Iile looking for the larvae in the field a solitary specimen of &gt;■ opaca Say was found moving sluggishly over the ground. Mr. . identified this as the same as certain "black bugs" of which he en inquiring, great numbers of which had swarmed in the fields ter harvest Uate July), and other farmers corroborated this testi - t'rom experience in their own fields. In fact we hail received of this occurrence from McCook, in the same general region, at le. So abundant were these beetles on ihe Hewett farm that the tried poisoning them, but with what success he did not ascertain, days up to the latter part of October they were still in evidence. Kwing my visit to Beaver City there was a heavy rain in the and immediately after this rain the larvae were found "crawling the top of the ground by the thousand" but returned to a slight ter the ground had dried out somewhat. Following this rain the distinctly abated, according 10 Mr. Hewett, who kindly kept the nder observation for us, the larvae seemingly not injuring the ted wheat or sprouts. While no corn fields were examined by the writer while at Beaver City, farmers stated that the larvae were present there also, even in one field which had not been cropped to wheat for five years. Furthermore, in our breeding cages the larvae ate corn kernels greedily, apparently enjoying them equally to the wheat kernels. Two of these larvae were taken from a box containing several ears of corn shipped in from Gothenburg, Ne - braska, as samples of corn-ear worm injury; supposedly they had located themselves in the tip of fallen ears and en transit had made their way out. Accordingly, we shall not be surprised if the pest is found to be at times of considerable injury to corn also. tcimens of the larvae were sent to Professor F. M. Webster, who with the determination of Professor Bruner regarding its apparent aships. Taking into consideration the great abundance of the of Eleodes opaca in the fields during the summer, and the abun - of these certainly allied larvae in the same fields in the fall, we stifled in provisionally referring the new pest to that species until be verified or disproved by actual breeding records. That these larvae have considerable resistance to cold is shown by an accident which befell one of our breeding cages. On the night of </seg>
            <seg id="p237">237 tuary 28 a storm blew in one of the windows and dashed the cage to floor, spilling the contents. This happened at about 10 p. m., and until the next morning at 10 a. m. they were exposed to a wind of from fifty-nine to seventy-two miles an hour at a temperature hovering about zero; they were gathered up and placed in a warm room and out of the eleven thus gathered eight recovered activity and burrowed into the ground again. On April 14, 1909. the Hewett field was again examined by Mr. C. H. Gable, and he found that the stand was so thin that the field was being disked preparatory to planting a new crop. Other fields were in the same condition. The larvae were not in the drill rows, as a most careful ex - amination disclosed, but were abundant just underneath the surface in the little piles of loose, dry. drift dirt about the old corn stubs, sometimes as many as thirty al&gt;out a single stub. They were also feeding upon the crowns of the wheat plants to a small extent, especially where these were adjacent to the drifts where they were congregated. Mr. Gable found Eae actually engaged in this injury, the exact character and extent of 'h is shown In the accompanying illustration. Our observations upon this insect are as yet too incomplete to justify any suggestions as to preventives of Injury, but with a more complete knowledge of its life-history we hope to be able to furnish some helpful ideas along this line. Wu-.kwobmb. — Conspicuous amons the insect enemies of planted seeds rereals are the various kinds of wireworms. Wlreworms are the young larval stage of the click-beetles or snapping beetles (Elateridae) of which there are considerably over five hundred different kinds in North America. These click-beetles are the familiar elongate oval, flattened, dark-colored beetles which when placed upon their backs will snap their body at the loose junction of the prothorax and mesothorax and with a characteristic click will snap themselves up into the air and usually re - gain their feet. The wireworms themselves are so different from moat other larvae that no difficulty should be experienced in recognizing them at a glance: they are six-legged, elongated, slender, round bodied crea- tures, with a flattened head bearing in front the large horizontally placed jaws, followed by a dozen distinct, very hard and smooth body segments all of a shining brownish color, varying in shade from yellowish brown to reddish brown, and ending with a well -developed anal proleg on fhe under surface of the tip of the body. In size they range from one-half to over an inch in length when full grown. All of the different kinds of wireworms injurious to crops look much alike, and their uni - formity in form and hardness of body has made the common name applicable to the entire group. Not all wireworms are injurious to crops, however, for the majority have habits or food plants which render them quite harmless to agricul - ture, feeding as they do on decaying wood or the roots of weeds or wild grasses of various kinds. A few forms are very troublesome to field crops </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 and vegetables, and about ten species have proved more or less injurious to corn. Of these several species of the genus Melanotus are by far the most important; the true Corn W'ireworm (if. cribulosus Lee.) is com - mon and destructive in the corn belt from Nebraska to Illinois and east to the Atlantic, while two closely related species (M. communis Qyll. and g tills Say) taken together are almost as destructive as the Corn ■orm itself. Both of these latter species are widely distributed. ig from Nebraska to New Jersey and north into Canada, and are suishable from the Corn Wireworm principally by having the last nt of the body feebly instead of coarsely punctured and with live or angles instead of three. The Wheat Wireworm (Agriotes manru.i and its allies A. pubescent. Asaphes itecoloratus. Drasteriut elegant. Melanotus infaustus. a spe'ies of Cnrdiophorus. and in the corn fields of the South the Southern Corn Wireworm (Monocrepidius vespertinus) all attack corn to a greater or less extent. The several genera of wireworms attacking corn may be identified by the following table K?ment of the body with two backward prolongations or cercl. ■ger. about one inch long when full grown. . . .Asaphes decoloralus aller, about one-half inch long when full grown. Head broader than long Dratterius elegans. Body of the usual length and thickness A pair of black pits at the base of the last segment, Agriote* spp No such pair of black pits on the last segment. . . .Melanottit spp. Injury by wireworms may become manifest in two ways. If the planted seed is attacked, and this is the most common and conspicuous type of injury, the wireworms burrow into and often completely through the kernel, or even consume it entirely, thus preventing the sprouting of the seed and consequently the start of the young plant, and necessitating a replanting of the field. If the seed fails to produce the young plants in due time after planting, on digging into the hill the muti - lated kernels and the insects which have caused the injury may be dis - covered, the latter often with their heads embedded In the kernel. The plant may be attacked after it has reached some growth also, the smaller roots being devoured and the larger ones severely gnawed and pene - trated, or else the stalk below the ground may be gnawed or bored through and riddled with small round tunnels, in either case the effect being to either kill the plant or seriously stunt its growth. This latter type of injury is made obvious by the sudden wilting of the plant, and as in the case of injury to the seed the wireworms may readily be found among the roots, often from six to a dozen of them at a hill. Rrmally wireworms live in grasslands, feeding upon the roots of all of grasses and many common weeds, and in such situations do Head longer than broad Monocrepidius vespertinu* Last segment of the body pointed and without eerei.

            <seg id="p239">239 little or no harm. But when such grass-lands are broken up and put Into corn or other grain they are likely to become injurious to the new crop, especially during the second year after the breaking up of the sod. Two or three years at least are spent as larvae, for wirewonns develop very slowly, and the grass roots having all decayed or been devoured during the first year the insects have only the corn left to feed upon and consequently concentrate their attack upon it. During the first year of their larval life the wireworms cease feeding about the middle of No - vember and go down in the earth for from five or six inches to a foot to hibernate until the following spring. In July or August of their last year as wireworms they become dormant and pupate, and after three or four weeks in that condition change into the adult beetle form, but are at first very soft and tender and require several weeks before their body becomes hard and dark. In the fall individuals of some species emerge and pass the winter in such sheltered places as they can find above ground. such as cracks in logs, under strips of loose bark or beneath boards and stones, but the great bulk remain within the pupal cell in the earth and do not make their way out until the following spring. From April to June eggs are laid in grasslands, weed patches and other moist places grown up to grassy vegetation, including the fields of corn and small The attack of wireworms upon the small grains resembles in all essen - tial respects the work of these insects on corn, and most of the species which injure corn are harmful to whea* also. They gnaw at and more or less completely devour the planted seed, usually bpginning at the germ end of the kernel, and thus prevent germination, or else later when the plant has started they completely eat away the roots, causing the young plant to wither up and die in the drill rows. The species most concerned in the destruction of small grains is the Wheat Wireworm (Agriote* mancu* Say), and its practically indistinguishable congener A. pubetceru ilelsh These two wireworms are widely distributed in the northern T'nitPd States, occuring commonly from Nebraska to New York, and Him very closely with the general type of life history as described In the dis - cussion of the corn wireworms. spending three years as larvae, pupating in July and transforming in a few weeks, but not leaving the pupal sells until the following April. Another species conspicuously injurious to wheat is Drasterius elegan* Fabr.. a very small wireworm which lives for two years as such, transforming In midsummer to beetles which soon emerge and. hibernating in sheltered places until the following spring, continues activity and egglaying until in June. It is worthy of note that these two last species, because of the habit of the beetles in leaving the pupal chamber in summer and early fall, would not prove amenable to the disastrous effects of fall plowing, as most species are. A third species, hM ill ■rnlnratiis Say. is particularly fond of oats, and is found over most of the northern states east of the Mississippi river This wirewonn pupates rather early, usually late in May or early in June, and after </seg>

Melanotu.i rommunis Gyll. and M. fissilis Say are also depredators In the fields of small grain as well as In corn. Working as they do beneath the surface of the ground and possessed of an extremely hardy and resistive nature, wireworms are very difficult to combat effectively. Their natural enemies are few. but they are at - tacked by fungous diseases to a certain extent ( Metarrtiiziu* and Cordi - cept) and they are eaten both as wireworms and click -beetles by several kines of birds, the Crow. Robins. Brown Thrasher and various kings of blackbirds being especially valuable in this respect. The farmer cannot place his dependence in these, however, but must place his dependence In avoiding planting crops conspicuously subject to wireworm attack In soil known or suspected to be badly Infested, In replanting later in the Mason if the first planting of seed is destroyed, and In such other cultural and remedial measures as give promise of successful re3ults. Messrs. Comstock and Slingerland of Cornell and Forbes of Illinois Experiment Stations have conducted extensive experiments attempting to find a remedy for wireworms, and while they failed to find that remedy their work has great value in pointing out the uselessness of several sug - gested schemes for avoiding wireworm injury. Work has been carrried on along three distinct lines, namely the protection of the planted seed, the destruction of the larvae, and the destruction of the pupae and aduli beetles. The destruction of the seed being especially serious much atten - tion was given to this aspect of injury: the seed was treated with a great variety of preparations and subjected to wireworm attack in the hope of finding some effective poison or repallant, but all not only failed to kill the worms, but. whai is worse, often retarded or prevented tne germ - ination of the seed itself. Coating the seed with Paris green and flour and with tar. or soaking it in solutions of salt, copperas, chloride of lime, strychnine, arsenic, corrosive sublimate, cyanide of potassium or in pure terpentine or kerosene all proved ineffective since the wireworms deroured such treated kerenels and apparently experienced no bad effects, thus demonstrating the complete impracticability of such methods In attempt - ing to protect the seed. In the destruction of the wireworms themselves it was found that the idea of starving out the creatures by rotation with supposedly immune crops failed to accomplish the desired end. although for a time this scheme was supposed to have solved the problem. The crops proposed to be interposed hetween grassland and corn or in infested fields between the crops of corn or small grains were clover, buckwheat, rape and mus - tard, but all of these proved iiRon experimentation to be devoured by wireworms to a sufficient extent that they were easily enabled to complete their growth and transformations as well as If they were In grass, which would render the value of the rotation in starving them out comparatively very small; nevertheless a short rotation, especially with a clover as an alternate has the general effect of lessening wireworm injury.

Bisulphide of carbon will also ldll wireworms when poured in a hole near the affected plant, but is far too difficult of application and expensive to be used generally. Certain fertilizers such as kainit have value as insecticides, but In the case of wireworms Professor Webster found that even if applied at the rate of 2,400 pounds per acre the worms were neither destroyed or driven away, and its only appreciable value would be its stimulation to the plant. Salt, lime, chloride of lime, muriate of potash and other substances have likewise been found impractical since they either do not affect the wire - worms at all or else to do so must be used in such enormous quantities that they prove destructive to vegetation or become too expensive for profitable application. The best destroyer of wireworms yet discovered is the cultivation of the soil In the late summer and fall, this procedure having the highly beneficial effect of greatly diminishing the number of wireworms present in the soil the uext year. Early fall plowing and disking when it can be practised, breaks up the pupal cells and exposes the very tender pupae or recently transformed adults, which are equally tender, to the elements and natural enemies, and practically every insect contained in a cell so disturbed perishes. Such plowing can be begun any time after the first of August with beneficial results, since by this time almost all of the mature larvae have pupated, and the more finely the soil is pulverized and the more frequently it is disturbed the more pupal cells will be broken up. Another feasible method of wireworm control is the destruc - tion of the click-beetles which give rise to them by the use of poisoned baits. When these click-lieetles are abundant in a given locality in the spring, as very frequently occurs, slices of potato or wads of green clover treated with arsenic or strychnine are placed in the protected nooks where the bettles abound and will destroy many of them with but very little trouble and expense. Various species of myriapods or thousand-legged worms, as they are popularly called, sometimes gnaw the planted seed much after the manner of wireworms, but their injuries are never very serious and need not be considered in detail. The forms injuring corn belong to the group of myriapods which have two pairs of legs to each segment, live in the soil or other damp places and feed entirely upon vegetable matter, preferably that in process of decay, known as the Diplopodo and especially to the family Julidae in that group. The species which have actually been found </seg>

The larvae of the Banded Ips {Ips fasriatus Oliv.) and of the Pale-striped Flea beetle (Xystena tneiiiata Say) have been found occasionally gnawing into or boring through the kernels, and both of these are very small, soft bodied, six legged larvae easily told from wireworms. The adult beetle of the Banded Ips sometimes gnaws into the milky corn in the ear as well as upon a great variety of other vegetable substances; it hibernates in the beetle stage and passes through two generations each year, the larvae feeding upon various plants such as rotten apples and squash roots and pupating in a cell in the earth. The adult of the Pale-striped Flea - beetle also injures corn as well as other plants and weeds, gnawing away the edges of the leaves or riddling them with holes after the manner characteristic of flea-beetles. Tut Skkh-Corn Maooot (Pfionnm futficepi Zetterstedt i. — Plant&gt; corn is sometimes penetrated by small, white, footless, cylindrical maggots about a quarter of an inch in length which devour the soft, mealy in - terior of the kernel, leaving only the hard outer shell. The grain Is usually attacked after it has sprouted but before the growing shoot has made its appearance above ground, the maggot entering the seed near the germ and after destroying this continuing to devour the remaining portions of the kernel. Of the plants which succeed in getting a start many have the young sprouts, roots and underground portions of the stem severely gnawed and bored into by these maggots, causing the injured parts to decay and ultimately killing the plant. Not only is corn attacked in this manner, but young growing beans and peas are very seriously injured and this damage is so prevalent that the insect has come to be known as the bean fly. The roots of cabbage, such root vegetables as turnips, radishes and beets, as wel| as the onion and potato are also attacked to a greater or less extent when corn or beans are not readily available. The parent of the seed-corn maggot is a small, two-winged fly. super - ficially almost a miniature of the common house fly, but rather more slender, and measuring about one-fifth of an inch in length. It is prob - ably of European origin, having been discovered in America for the first time in 1856. hut at present has reached a wide distribution in the I'nited States and Canada from ocean to ocean, and it is apparently be - coming a more serious pest each succeeding year in this country, espe - cially upon the vegetable crops. Its life-history is not fully known. The winter is probably passed mostly in the adult fly stage and the attack of the flies in the spring is centered largely upon the planted seed* and young sprouts of the corn and bean plants. In the northern states </seg>
            <seg id="p243">243 the maggots may be found from the middle of May to the middle of June, the pupal stage being entered into during early June, while the earliest of the new brood of flies emerges during the same month and flies continue to appear until early In August. It ig very probable that a second brood of maggots are reared in weeds or decaying vegetation and refuse, which because of its comparative harmlessness has escaped ac - curate observation, and that it is the flies or puparia resulting from this brood which carries the insect over the winter. The puparia are elongated oval, light blown and about three-twentieths of an inch long by one-third as wide. In the southern states the first flies appear from January to March and it is probable that several generations are gone through during the year. This maggot does some good by feeding upon grasshopper eggs, and in the fall of 18TL wtm said to have destroyed ten per cent of the grasshopper eggs in Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska. Like the common house fly this insect is frequently severely attacked by fungous diseases (Empusa) which cause the death of many. When omes necessary to artificially combat these maggots it is of first importance to prevent infestation of the plants by deterring the flies from laying their eggs in the fields in the spring, and to be of value any measures with this end in view must of course be applied before the eggs are laid. Fertilizers such as kainit, nitrate of soda and chloride of potash have this desired repellant effect if they are applied while the ground is still thoroughly wet from a shower. The first application may be made as a top dressing before planting, and applications made after the plants have started should be applied as closely to the roots a* possible. Organic fertilizers such as stable manure or rotting leaves should be avoided in case of serious attack by this insect as they attract the Hies and would have precisely opposite the desired effect; in fact these flies breed readily in manure, excrement or other decomposing material. After the maggots have gotten fairly started on their work there is no efficacious remedy of value for the corn field, but In the garden the same remedies as are elsewhere advocated for the very closely related Cabbage Maggot (Pegomya brassicae) and Onion Maggot {P. ceptorum) may be applied with good results. It is seldom, however, that the seed-corn maggot becomes destruclive enough in corn fields to necessitate taking up artificial measures for its control. Another maggot which sometimes attacks planted seed corn is a species of fungus-gnat (sciara) which penetrates and hollows out the kernel, especially when the seed is beginning to rot because of too much cool, wet weather. This larva is cylindrical, smooth, about one-third of an inch long and in color is white with a jet black head, which later character has caused the name of Black-headed Grass Maggot to be applied to it As many as twenty of these maggots may infest a single kernel of corn. Normally they feed on decaying vegetation in old sod land and they affect corn only when it follows grass. This insect is even less harmful than the seed-corn maggot and does not require special attention from the entomologist </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 8na&gt;-CoRx Beetles. — Small bettles are sometimes the cause of serious injury to seed corn in the ground by gnawing the germ of the kernel as soon as it has become somewhat softened by the moisture in the soil, thereby preventing the germination of the seed, and in many cases lol'ow this up by entering the kernel and eating out the contents, leaving only the safer sin 11 intact. At least four different species are concerned in this destructive work, two of them belong &lt;o the family of ground • s [Carabi'lae). a group of normally predaceous insects, and two of them to the family of lamellicorn beetles ( Scarabaeidae) , one to the group of .lung-beetles and the othpr to the group of rhinoceros-beetlea. The ground-beetles are by far the more destructive in their ravages on planted seed corn. These four beetles may be distinguished by the following table: Antennae slender, composed of a series of similar cylindrical joints. A slender, dark reddish beetle witlf the junction between the thorax and abdomen much constricted; length about a quarter of an inch — Slender Seed-corn Ground-beetle. An oblong, pale, yellowish beetle with a dark head, the middle of the thorax and wing covers clouded with blackish, and the thorax broadly joined to the abdomen; length a quarter to one-third of an inch — Seed-corn Ground-beetle. Antennae heavy, composed of a stem-like base bearing a bunch of flat blade-like joints at the tip. A small, short, convex, black, slow moving beetle about one-fifth of an inch long — Aphodius Dung-beetle. I large, robust, dark brown to blackish beetle resembling a small Jimebug, from one-half to nearly three-fourths of an inch in length — Carrot-beetle. The most important of these four seed-corn beetles is the Slender Seed-corn Ground-beetle U'livina impressifurns Le Conte), a species found from Nebraska and Kansas to Illinois, Michigan, Indiana. Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania and south 10 Mexico. It affects principally corn planted in the rich, black soil of low, flat, moist bottom lands, and attacks the seed in June by entering the germ end and devouring the interior completely, sometimes ns many as five in a kernel. After the kernel has sprouted and the plant has gotten a start this beetle will not usually molest it. They work down to a depth of several inches in the earth, and continue working in the soil through the summer. During the spring of 1906 serious local damage by this beetle was re - ported from all over the corn belt of the United States, and the pest seems to be on the increase. The Seed-corn Ground-beetle (Agonodrrtu pallipes Fnbririvs) is another widely distributed species, being found in most parts of the United States and Canada, which devours the germ of planted corn and buries Itself In the kernel, but this beetle sometimes attacks the sprouting roots also, and is not infrequently injurious to </seg>

Ants. — In addition to the indirect injuries perpetrated by ants by rearing and caring for the destructive corn-root aphis, which are dis - cuaaed in detail among the remarks concerning the root aphids. certain • s are directly injurious by their habit of entering and hollowing out the planted kernel, especially when injury has been started by some other insect. They do not devour the interior which they gnaw out. but scatter it in the shape of a fine meal through the dirt, as apparently they care only for the sweet, oily fluids of the planted and softened kernel. This injury is nevtr common enough to be serious, and so far only a few species of ants have been found concerned in it. The commonest one is a very small, pale yellowish species, only about three sixteenths of an inch in length, known as Aolenopsis debilis Mayr. which is found over practically the whole of the United States from Illinois and Texas to New York, New .Jerst y and Virginia. Another ant about three times as large as the species just mentioned and of a reddish color, known as Myrmica scabrinodis lobicornis Nyl.. also destroys planted corn in this manner, and is found not only throughout the greater part of North America but in Europe also. Both of these ants occasionally feed upon kernels at the tips of low or fallen ears, especially when the kernels have been more or less damaged by birds or Insects of other kinds. There are other species of small, widely distributed ants which feed in the kernels of corn in ihe ear, notably the Little Black ant (Honomorium minutum Mayr.). Prennlepis impart:; Say and Formica st'haufussi Mayr., but the damage done by all of these species is very insignificant. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">247 HEED WEEVIL* OK MHICHIDAE BY R. W. DAWW.V The veed weevils are small beetles which belong to the family Hruehidae. This family contains relatively few 1 species, all of which in their larval stages feed in the seeds of leguminous plants, and which are much more numerous in species in the tropics than in temperate regions. Many of them have become widely distributed by the shipping of seed from one region to another, but they are seldom seen in nature on account of their small size and obscure colors. The elytra are rather short and truncated at the end, thus leaving the tip of the abdomen expoRfd. The head is strongly bent downward and the body is relatiyely short and chunky. The hind legs are rather long and their femora considerably swollen. The Bruchidae are most closely related to the leaf-feeding beetles of the family Chrysomelitiae. Four species of these weevils have become of considerable economic importance in this country They are Bruvhus obtectus Say, B. Pisorum Linn., B. chinensis Linn, and B. quadrimaculatus Fab. The Bean Weevil iBruchus obtectus Say). — The beetle is one of the most formidable insect enemies of the bean plant with which we have to deal. During the past year a number of reports of injury by bean weevils have come in to the State Entomologist from the eastern half of the state, in some cases seed beans being reported as entirely de - stroyed. This insect was first described in July, 1831 by Thomas Say, but never attracted any attention by its ravages until 1870. The origin cf the species is rather doubtful, but its original home was probably Central or South America. It was first found in cultivated beans in Xorth America in 1860, when it made its appearance in Rhode Island, and by 1873 it was recognized as the commonest Bruchid east of the Rocky Mountains. It is Tiow found in every state of the Union, in Yexico and South America, and is widely distributed in the old world. The rapid spread of this beetle over such an extended area, as has been the case with several of these weevils, was due to its being transported from one region to another in shipments of seed. The insect in question is a little brownish or olive tinted beetle amout three millimeters in lengths and two in width. The wing covers are distinctly streaked and the arrangement of the short, silky pubescens gives the insect a slight mottled appearance as is shown in the figure. The beetle attacks the beans in the field while the pods are still green and succulent. The very small, pale-colored eggs are deposited by the female teetles on the surface of the pods, in little cracks or depres - sions, or in little holes made by the beetles themselves. The eggs hatch </seg>

The origin of this species, like that of the bean weevil, has been a rather disputed question. Professor Rlley rejearded it as an indigenous North American insect, but there seems to be us for bettering that it came from the Orient.

Since the predaceons habit In this order is so very excep - . the insects which practice it are of much interest, and the aim 8 paper is to present briefly the food habits, general appearance, imily relatives of these exceptions. Two families are represented among the moths, the Pyralidae and Tineidae. The Pyralidae are mostly small moths, rarely with a wing expanse of over an inch, but as a whole the family is of great economic importance. The more common and important of this family are ihe grape leaf folders which cause great damage in vineyards, the Bee Moth (Galleria mellonella Linn.), which is very harmful in bee-hives, and the Meal Moth ( Pyralis farinalix). the larvae of which sometimes cause a hasty departure from the lunch counter when the morning bowl of oat - meal is only partially eaten. In this family Pyralidae we also find the rlose-winged moths which rest lengthwise of grass stems, and are very hard to distinguish, since- they are but little thicker than the stems upon which they rest: some moths which as larvae feed on dried fruits: and others which live as borers. Among all these only the two species which we are to consider seem to show any tendency to become pre - daceous. There are, so far as we know, none with intermediate habits, such as living on dead animal matter. Oomstock described the first species in 1879 as Dakruma roccidivora. It. however, was put into the genus Laetilia by Ragnot. so that now it is known as I.aetilia ron-idivora (Comstock). The larvae were found feeding upon the Cottony Maple Scale (Pulvinaria innumerabilisi. The larva burrows beneath the fluffy mass of excrement covering the scale, and after spinning a delicate silken tube about its body begins to devour the insect. If the scales cover the branch rather thickly the larva extends the tube from one scale to another, thus forming a passageway through which it may move freely. Further than this the life history is not yet well worked out. but Hulst states that the egg stage lasts about six days, and the pupal stage ten days. Laetilia paVida was named by Comstock in 1879. The specimens were reared from Kermes. the gall-like scale on Oak. This moth is Tery similar to Laetilia coceidivora. only somewhat lighter, as the specific </seg>

This record of Banks' is unique for the species genus found in North America, although at least one European has a similar habit of egg deposition. The eggs hatch in the course of a day or two and the young Aphis - lions scramble down the egg stalk, moult, and immediately start out in (|in st of plant lice, which form their principle article of food. These larvae greatly resemble the young of the common "ladybird," which is also often seen running about upon the foliage of the trees and shrubs. The mandibles, or jaws, of the young Chrysopas. are very large and sickle shaped, with a groove on the under side through which the juices of the victim are sucked up. This explains why the Chrysopa holds its prey "at arms length" while devouring it. The lace-wing flies feed for the most part on the various species of plant lice, but they also feed on other soft bodied insects, such as the Pear-me Psylla iPsylla pyntala) scale insects of various kinds, the chinch-bug [Blissun liinoiiterus Say), the Elmleaf-beetle ( Galerucflla luteola Mull.

One will find many references to this food habit of the Chrysopas in various Entomological publications. Shinier records having observed one of these Chrysopas [Chrysopa plorabunda Fitch), to be greedily feeding upon the c-hinch-biigs in a field of corn, and estimates that there was at least one Chrysopa larva to every stalk of the thickly-sown corn, and in a short time the field was entirely rid of the pest. But it is in relation to the plant-lice that the Chrysopa is of the importance to the farmer. They are the worst predaceous enemy of the "Green-bug" (Toxoptera graminuin Rondani) and very materially aid in the control of this pest. It has been found by actual experiment that two Chrysopa larvae will destroy the young of quite a colony of plant lice as rapidly as these insects reproduce. In our own state they feed commonly upon the corn-leaf louse [Aphis maidis Fitch); the melon aphis (Aphis gossypii Glover); the boxelder aphis (Cliaitophorus "tittis Thomas p; and the cherry aphi* t .1/ ■■■:«.« ceraai Fab.); and in the control of these pests are of great value to the farmer and horticulturist.

This and similar questions have enily l:een asked of the writer by persons who seem to think that and every living thing has been created solely for some special It to man. Primarily the common house fly (Musca domestica), together with several of its allies which habitually frequent human habitations, are scavengers. In this role they assist in the removal of filth and litter of various sorts that too often are permitted to accumulate in the vicinity of our homes, schools, offices, and places of business or pleasure. These flies lay their eggs upon such materials as manure, decaying vegetable matter, sewage, and other filth. The resulting maggots devour these substances, hence are, to a considerable degree, beneficial. The house fly has become so widely and generally disseminated In its distribution over the earth's surface that it may be considered cosmopolitan. Although primarily a denizen of human habitations, it seems to be present also in such out-of-the-way places as uninhabited localities in dense forests, wide prairies, and wild mountain fastnosni. In localities like these latter it is very quickly attracted by the odor of different foods, upon which it congregates along with several other kinds of flies possessing similar food-habits. ■ice the life history of several different species of these flies is .hat similar, that of one of them will answer for all, so far at as present purposes are concerned. House flies hibernate either as imagoes tucked carefully in some secluded nook or cranny about the house or outbuildings, or else aa puparia stowed away in or noir manure piles or some other accumulation of filth where the larvae of the last brood of the previous fall congre - gated and fed. In early spring the warmth from the sun causes them to awaken and stir about. The sexes mate and eggs are deposited tn numbers of 100 or more by each female. These soon hatch into maggots that feed ravenously and are full grown in from four to six days, when they transform to puparia. This latter stage is maintained for a like period, t. «■.. from four io six dayB, depending, of course, upon the climatic conditions as humidity and aridity that then prevail. The average time required for the completion of a single generation being, perhaps, close to ten or twelve days during summer and somewhat longer when cooler weather prevails. This would permit of from ten to a dozen generations being reared each year here in . Nebraska, and several additional ones in sections to the southward of us. Small flies are not the young of larger ones, but usually belong to other species. Young flies are maggots. </seg>

While the larvae or maggots are habitually reared in filth such aa various kinds of manure, decaying vegetation, human excreta, sewage, etc.. the mature insects, or the flies themselves. In addition are equally fond of all sorts of human foods, both solid and liquid. Over these they swarm when allowed to do so: and. by Ihe use of their fleshy, specially-constructed prolopcis or mouth-parts, suck up certain liquid portions of the foods. In their restless movements, flies pass quickly from place to place, and from one kind of substance to another. In the course of a few moments a single fly may crawl over human or other excrement, sip from a glass of milk or water, and merrily chase across a dish of mashed potatoes, or other human food. It may rlslt a dead and decaying animal, or sport about the mouth of a reeking sewer, and In the next five or ten minutes sip from the edge of a glass of jelly or alight in the sugar bowl. It may visit the body of an animal that has died of anthrax, and a little later brush across a lacerated hand or cheek. I&gt;urlng these varied gyrations and visitations, the limbs and bodies of flies, which are rather hairy or bristly, become more or less hearily laden with filth, germs, and spores, which matter rubs off from time to time, and thus commingles with and contaminates food and other articles over which they crawl. Some, in fact most, of the perms and spores of fungi thus transported are harmless. A few. however, may be, and too frequently are, those which produce human diseases or blood-poisoning: and. since these insects are so widely spread over various portions of the different continents, flies may be the agenry for spreading the germs of typhoid fever, cholera, dysentary. and many other dangerous intestinal diseases. They also carry germs and fungi of decay both of animal and vegetable matter. The spread of tvphoid fever on the canvn grounds at Chickamauga.

While the possibility for multiplication In insects like the house fly is almost unlimited as to numbers, the actual increase is very much smaller. This restriction In reproduction is due to a number of caoaes. Some of these are: Lack of breeding places, of food, the absence of </seg>
            <seg id="p260">260 favorable climatic conditions, the presence of and attacks by natural enemies, man's attempts at sanitation, etc. By referring to the figures already given in connection with the life - history of the house fly, it will be seen that without any restrictions whatsoever, a single house fly could be the progenitor of over 195 quad - rillions of these flies by the end of the tenth generation. This number is almost inconceivable, since it would mean more than 195 millions of bushels of flies, allowing an even million of the insects to a bushel. To produce even this comparatively small number, the food supply would have to be practically unlimited. As there are many, instead of only a single fly. at the beginning of each spring, it is readily seen that limita - tion in food supply is a very important factor in the restriction of their increase. Too much wet or dry weather, together with a falling of temperature, also influences unfavorably the growth and transformation of these and other insects. Natural enemies in the form of parasitic and predaceotiB insects kill large numbers of both the young and mature flies, while fungous and other diseases rarry off countless millions of them each year. To these chief factors in the checking of their increase must be added the reductions made by the continued onslaught of batrachians. reptiles, liirds. and other rertebntM, many of which feed largely upon Hi I ring more recent years man has also taken an active part in ing this scourge— sometimes intentionally, but more often un - igly. This last important restrictive influence has been accom - ■d largely by attempts at neatness and sanitation with the chief in view of removing unp!&lt; asant odors, disease germs, etc., rather for the prime purpose of destroying flies. From the brief statements already made it may be readily inferred that there is still much room for additional efforts on the part of man if ho would more completely protect himself from this comparatively small and seemingly insignificant but important pest, which, as has been shown, is not only an unmitigated nuisance, but a dangerous menace to human health as well. Some very effective aiils in this work are window and door screens, the use of stickly and poisonous fly paper, various fly traps, insect powdprs, smudges.'and other repellants. etc . any and all of which, along with numerous additional devices, are being daily employed in our warfare against this army of pestiferous insects. Many of these agencies, as we may readily see, are merely barriers to shut out the invading armies instead of aiming at their destruction. We should seek thefr death, or better still, prevent their birth, if we would accomplish the beat results. Knee fresh manure, and especially that of horses, is their favorite ing place, it follows that the treatment or removal of this substance to prevent its use for breeding purposes will be a very important in the right direction.

Other filth and debris composed of decaying vegetables, fruit, table scraps, slops, etc., should likewise be disposed of regularly instead of being left to decay in close proximity to our homes. Swill barrels should always be provided with fly-tight covers, and sewage disinfected and rendered as harmless as possible. Especially imperative that intestinal and other discharges from patients suffer - ing from typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, acute diarrhea, and similar infectious ailments, be completely sterilized before emptying into sewers or cesspools. In the country where many of these precautionary measures are more difficult of application, screens to doors and windows, covers for articles of food, slop barrels, etc.. at least may be provided. In addition, general cleanliness about the house should be observed by everybody and at all times: while stables and barn yards are less of a menace if not located too near human dwellings. Ball means avoid throwing out or exposing sewage containing germs hoid fever and intestinal diseases where it can be visited by flies. Fruits, vegetables, bread, pastry, confections, and other food-staffs when exposed for sale should be so guarded by nettings and screens as to prevent their contamination by flies which previously may have visited sewage, carrion, or other filth. By observing these and other simple precautionary measures aiuch suffering to humanity may be avoided and many a life prolonged. </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 BY J. T. ZIMMER. ine little insect known as the bedbug (Climex lectulanus Linn.) is &gt;f the most abhorred pests known to the housewife, and it is con - ed a signal disgrace to have the bedrooms invaded by it. It is not i's possible to avoid its ingress, nevertheless, as it has the unfortu habit of ensconcing itself in the baggage of travelers who are forced end a night in rooms infested by it. The matter is therefore im - nt enough to warrant consideration. The insect has been known by various names such as wall-louse, chinche, chintze. red-coat, etc. It is most widely distributed and is found almost everywhere that man has made his habitation. It is not appreci - ably limited by cold as it if present well northward, but it is most abuntant in the hot climates. It is also well known on shipboard, this undoubtedly aiding in its distribution. Its original home was prob - ably southeastern Europe, Asia and Africa as it has always abounded in the latter country, living in the huts of the natives, and was most certainly known to the ancients, for it is mentioned in the writings of Aristophanes, Dioscorides, Pliny, and Aristotle. It appeared in England as early as 1503 and was supposed to have been introduced from North America through incorrectly eo as it was entirely unknown among the Indians. It appeared in this county, however, soon after extensive settlement began and has distributed itself over the entire land. The bedbug belongs to the sub-ordei Hemiptera-Heteroptera, family Acanthiidr.e, and common with the so-called flower-bugs. The adults are about one-fifth of an inch in length with the body broadly ovate and exceedingly flat. In color they are a reddish brown, which characteristic, together with the shape of the boiy, has led to them being at times popularly designated as "mahogany-flats." The wings are mere rudimen - tary scales or pads which, however, vary in degree of development and which some travelers aver, though with what degree of accuracy I am unable to ascertain, are at times in t!&gt;e tropics;, fully developed. One of the most characteristic features of this insect is the distinct, disagreeable, "buggy" odor which it possesses. This odor comes from an oily, volatile liquid extruded from minute odoriferous orifices which, in the immature forms of the insect, are situated on the back of the thorax, but in the adult, on the venter. The odor is not peculiar to bedbugs but is possessed in common with the plant-bugs. With these latter insects it is most certainly a protective development which renders them obnoxious to their enemies, but with the parasites, not only does it fail to furnish protection but instead renders the insects conspicuous, thus leading to their more speedy destruction and extermination. THE BEDBUG (Cimcx icctuUirius lAun.). </seg>
            <seg id="p263">263 The mouth parts of this bug are well adapted to their function of blood-sucking. They consist of a fleshy lower lip or labium in which lie four hair-like filaments, the maxillae and mandibles. These filaments or setae glide alternately over one another and pierce the skin of the host. Then by their continued motion they cause the blood to flow freely in order that it may the more readily be drawn up through the tubular lal'ium. The bite produces different effects in different people. To some it Is no more serious than the prick of a needle would be while to others it is very poisonous, and produces slight swelling and painful inflamma - tion which, however, is not due to a poisonous secretion in the insect other than the ordinary digestive juices of the mouth. The insect Is. nevertheless, quite capable of transmitting human disease and has, on occasion, been suspected on fairly corroborative evidence of being the carrier of tuberculosis. Its significance may thus be greater than might at first sight be apparent. The metamorphosis of the bedbug, like that of all the Hemiptera, is incomplete. The eggs are laid during the warmer season in several batches of from six to fifty each, although this varies according to the degree of warmth and the food supply. In all, about two-hundred are laid which the female deposits in crevices, joints of bedsteads, cracks in the wall, under loose wall-paper, etc. They are about one-thirty-second of an inch in length, white in color, and oval in shape and are slightly narrowed at one end and terminated by a cap with a projecting rim. In a week or ten days the eggs hatch when the larvae push off the cap and emerge. These larvae are pale yellowish-white and nearly trans - parent and resemble the adults very much but have the heads broader and the antennae shorter and lack the wingpads. With each successive molt, however, the young assume more and more the color and appearance of the adults. These molts are five in number and occur at intervals which depend to a great extent on the degree of warmth and the food supply. Generally, though, about eleven weeks are required for the complete metamorphosis. There is ordinarily one meal between each molt which means that the parasites must bite their hosts five times before maturation and once again before oviposition. If these mssls are two or three weeks apart, the larvae will remain unchanged during that period and without any food, will suspend molting indefinitely. Experimenters have kept the adults alive and healthy for a year without food and some have even claimed to have extended this period to six ye-irs It is this ability of the bugs to go without food that make* their extermination so difficult a matter. El bedbugs are entirely nocturnal in their habits and work only in rkness. If a light is lit suddenly, they will scurry away to their places though only to return again when darkness once more They are not very active in winter or in cold rooms and If the r is extreme, the adults may hibernate.

They escape by crawling along alls, water-pipes, gutters, etc., and will thus infest neighboring ngs formerly free from them. The insects have been reported as found under the bark of trees in forests but it is very likely if not almost certain that the bugs so discovered belong to the genus Aratlus and although superficially re - sembling bedbugs, are, in fact, quite different insects. However there may be some truth in the reports, as bedbugs are known to live for a long time on the sites of deserted human habitations. They have also been reported as found in the nests of birds, particularly those of the barn swallow, but these insects are a different species than lectularius. T true lectularius, or a variety of it, is, nevertheless, known to infest poultry-houses. I ere are a few natural enemies of this pest which seem to be of ial assistance in getting rid of it. Among these benefactors of ire some insects otherwise considered serious pests in themselves; 1 species of cockroaches and the little red ant (Monumorium jins Linn.). In fact some writers go even so far as to recommend introduction into houses to assist in abating the bedbug nuisance, lgh excellent results have been obtained by means of this remedy. 1 not, I fear, appeal to most housewives to whom either the ants I cockroaches would be almost as objectionable as the bugs. The masked bedbug-hunter (Opsicoetus personatus Linn.), one of the Reduviidae or assassin-bugs, seems to have a particular taste for bedbugs and enters houses for the express purpose of preying upon them. The only disadvantage seems to be that the insect in question will also bite l'uman beings and owing to its much larger size, is a more unpleasant bedfellow than the bedbugs. The blood-sucking cone nose (Conorhinas tanguisuyus Lee.) enters beds for the purpose of preying upon the human occupants but will also attack the other insects which are there for the same purpose. In Switzerland, it is claimed that fleas and bed - bugs are at constant warfare with each other, but the disadvantage seems to be that the bugs are always victorious. As no natural enemy thus appears to be of .practical importance, we must rely on artificial means to rid infested houses of this pest. Prim - arily, of course, prevention is the best remedy. This includes cleanliness about the house as well as the careful watching of the several methods and modes of ingress in order that the pest, in case of its introduction, may be eradicated before it has reached serious proportions. Loose papers on the walls offers a good breeding place for the insects as do also wooden bedsteads of the old type. The modern iron or brass bed - steads are a great step forwards in sanitation of this kind as few or no cracks or crannies furnish hiding places for the little creatures. In case the bugs are firmly established, one of the best remedies is benzine sprayed with a hand atomizer or inserted on a small brush or </seg>

Kerosene is not quite so good but is more lasting in its effects, when used in the same manner. A weak solution of sulphuric acid is also recommenced ■ me experimenters. Boiling water poured into the hiding places of the insect is paid to give good results as is carbon bisulphide when introduced into the same positions. Pyrethrum blown into the cracks will be effective when it can be made to reach the insects, hut It is generally of little use because of this difficulty. Bnting the cracks which the bugs inhabit, with a solution composed ounce of corrosive sublimate, one half pint of alcohol, and one pint of spirits of turpentine, is to be recommended. Carbolic acid I used for the same purpose and is also good. Bnigation has been tried with at least temporary success and con - n burning either sulphur or brimstone in the infested room. The ons given by Dr. J. A. Lintner of New York regarding the use of one. may be of some service. Dr. Lintner says: "Place in the center of the room a dish containing about four ounces of brimstone, within a larger vessel, so that the possible overflowing of the burning mass may not injure the carpet or set fire to the floor. After removing froii* the room all such metallic surfaces as might be affected by the fumes, close every aperture, even the keyhole, and set fire to the brimstone. When four or five hours have elapsed, the room may he entered and the windows opened for a thorough airing."

He knows both the practice and the theories of agriculture. He Is the only Nebraska farmer who has taken three I'egrees at the State University. This paper is Dr. Warren's thesis for the third or Doctorate degree. University of Nebraska. It is the first of the kind to be published in this country, and rightfully should Nebraska lead in this line, for she Is the most agricultural state. ■ Warren's paper will serve as a fitting basis for future investisa - and reports by the state and Federal departments since it treats ions that are of fundamental importance in agriculture. Let me recommend and commend Dr. Warren's thesis to all Ne - braska farmers for study, and to the public schools as the most valuable publication of Its kind. Yours very truly. O. B.

INTRODUCTION S1S54 there was not over one square mile of land under cultivation e territory of Nebraska.t but the unsurpassed fertility of the soil the salubriousness of the climate had begun to attract attention. .' a miner who crossed her rolling prairies seeking gold in California, being disappointed in his quest for wealth, returned and took the surer Ee of gathering golden harvests from Nebraska's wealth of soil, a soldier returning from the war accepted the government's invita - to make his home upon lfiO acres of trans-Missouri land. The advancing price of land in the East, and improvement in trans - portation and machinery, but most of all the remarkable responsiveness of the soil and the ease with which It could be cultivated, brought about a development which for rapidity and stability has rarely been equalled. Within the memory of comparatively young men still living in Nebraska, the state has been transformed from a preat hunting ground to one of the most prosperous, most productive and t;est improved agricultural states in the T'nlon. The men who slept in buffalo robes while they drove back the roving Indians have lived to see their home state now standing third in the production of corn, fourth in wheat and oats, fifth in rye, third in hogs, fourth in cattle, and sixth in horses and mules: to see her produce more than one-thirteenth the corn, one-fourteenth of the wheat, one-fifteenth of the oats, one-fourteenth of the hogs, and one - eigtheenth of the cattle of the whole TTnited States. Not only is Nebraska one of the first half dozen states In agricul - tural production but she is the most purely agricultural of them all. There is not a commercial forest or mine wi'hin her borders. And this is onlv the beginning The past and present are only an index of the possibilities for the future. Not onr acre in three has ever known the plow Of the other two-thirds probably one-half Is untillable. This leaves still many millions of acres of arable land unfilled, and that that is cultivated is as yet doing scarcely more than half of what It Is easily capable. • It If* ImnnnRlMe to mention the name* of all the persons to whom thank* are dne for asslstnnre In nssoinMlnjr the material h»-r*» presented, and for olferine valuable suggestions.

For these reasons it has seemed necessary to devote considerable apace to a review of the climate, geology, topography, etc.. in order that their influence on agriculture may be shown and that persons unfamiliar with the state may more easily "understand the conditions. Climate and soil constitute the natural agricultural resources of any country. Geology and climate of the past have made the soil what It The present climate, the soil, and the topography, determine the agricultural possibilities. The physical condition of the soil is deter - mined by its structure, its chemical composition, the weather and the tillage. These determine the crop producing power, but the best soil is useless without favorable climatic conditions. There are always many factors which affect directly the distribution of crops, that is, influences which determine how well that crop thrives or the profit which it produces. Among the most important of these forces are soil, topography, rainfall, temperature, length of season, roads and markets. Which of these factors is most important we will not attempt to say. Favorable conditions with respect to all are absolutely essential Very adverse conditions with respect to any one may, and often does, completely nullify the effect of favorable conditions with respect to all the others combined. Each of these forces becomes the limiting factor for the production of some crop in some part of the state. For example, an extremely poor soil, such as pure sand, is in - capable of producing corn. Along the Missouri river and other streams are many tracts of rich soil on bluffs so steep as to make cultivation impossible. In many parts of the west conditions are favorable except moisture, without which nothing can be grown. Temperature excludes peaches from the northern part, and the length of the season there is not sufficient for Kafir. In the sand hills of northern Nebraska are valleys where large crops of potatoes could be grown, but the distance to market and the bad roads make disposition of the crop impossible, while in Keya Paha county distance to market alone limits this crop.

In fact, such high tempera - tures seldom occur except during dry spells, so that they are not so oppressive as they would otherwise be, but the effect on vegetation la often severe In the evening there is usually a considerable drop in temperature, so that even in the hottest weather the nights are nearly always comfortably cool. THE ADVANCE OF THE SEASON The ground usually thaws out so that spring work can begin before the middle of March in the southern counties and by the first of April in the northern counties. In exceptionally early seasons a little spring wheat has been sown in the southwest counties in February, while In a few rare years, practically no work on the farm had been done before April 1; usually during a quarter to a half of March the conditions are such that plowing and seeding progress nicely in southern Nebraska. This period is not necessarily the last days of March, for frequently seeding in March is interrupted by a cold, stormy period which, of course, may extend into April, but this, however, is less likely to occur. • U. 8.

"About the time oat seeding is finished, early fruit begins to blossom, April 22 being the average date on which blossoms begin to be noticeable. The earliest of the fifteen years were 1895 and 1896, when the first blossoms began to open April 9 and 13 respectively. The most backward years were 1893 and 1892, the dales May 9 and 6, respectively. ' The date of full bloom is about ten days later than the date of beginning to bloom.

Clover is ready about fifteen to twenty days later than alfalfa, and timothy is usually cut June 30 to July 15.

Valentine and North Platte. The average of the four records gives 9.8 miles per hour as the mean annual velocity. It is generally supposed that the velocity is considerably higher in the western part of the state than in the eastern, but the data, while not RufBcient to determine this point, give no evidence to support the supposition. From an agricultural standpoint these records are not very satisfactory, that is, the exposures of the anemometers do not giye them the same wind conditions as surround farm crops. They shoul. Septed as accurate measurements of the wind sweep on our fields ■ariries These records show March and April to bp the windiest s with average velocities of 11.5 and 12.2 miles an hour, respect - while July and August are the calmest months, each having an e wind velocity of 8.fi miles per hour. Winds of thirty to forty miles an hour are not rare and higher velocities are recorded every year. These winds are nearly always straight and little damage is done, except to evaporate a large amount of moisture. While the wind velocity of the state is a serious detriment to growing crops in times of scant precipitation, it has a positive value for it pumps nearly all the water used, except in towns that are large enough to have public water systems. It is also utilized to a limited extent to run feed grinders and other small machinery. It is not often that a wind pump stands still for forty-eight hours at a time. The prevailing direction of the wind is from the south or southeast in summer and from the north or northwest in winter DESTRUCTIVE STORM Kiving winter storms sometimes occur but not with such frequency often supposed. The most destructive winds are the hot dry winds i at rare intervals have swept portions of the state, destroying crops. Nebraska lies pretty well out of the tornado belt. While a few small tornadoes have appeared within her boundaries, they are nothing like as frequent in occurence, or as destructive in character, as in many of the states to the east and south. Destructive hail storms sometimes occur but they usually affect only small areas, and any given locality is not often visited by them except at intervals of several years. It is rarely that a single storm is able to destroy both small grain and corn. Nebraska is not peculiarly subject to hail. What data there are upon this subject indicate that Nebraska has as few such storms as any state in the corn belt.

The most of our precipitation comes in general storms during the pa— age of low barometer areas across the state, but local showers are also common. The average annual precipitation for the state is very unevenly distributed, varying from about thirty-four inches in the south - east corner to about fourteen inches in Kimball county in the extreme southwest, as shown by chart No. 5. The decrease from east to west along the southern boundary seems to be fairly uniform, except possibly as the 100th meridian is approached, and averages about one inch to twenty miles. The rainfall is somewhat leas in the northern part of the state, except in the nothwest counties, where it seems to be influenced by the Black Hills and is greater than farther south. CHART Nab In making this chart all available dat.i have been considered, not only for stations within this state but for nearby stations in all the adjoining states. There is a lac}« of data for the Sand Hill Region and for many of the western counties, but there are several good, long records in the western part of the state, and. on the whole, it is believed that the chart is as good as can be made at present, and is sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. The average annual precipitation for the whole state for fifty-nine yean, 1850 to 1908, is 23.80 inches. The average for the six equal sec- tions, for the past thirty-three years is: Northeast 27.84 Southwest 23.54 Southeast 30.11 Western 17.53 Central 24.89 Northwest 18.83 This mean precipitation for each year from 1850 to 1908 and the average for the flfty-jiine years are shown graphically on chart No. 6. </seg>

Heavy snows are not very common. The ground is not often covered to a depth of more than 6 inches, and 'loes not usually stay lone. Considerable of the snow is generally blown itno drifts, and hencp does less good than it otherwise would. With the opening; of spring the increase of rainfall is very rapid and more than doubles in April. The rainfall for June is not only the heaviest for the year, but it is the most evenly distributed, the most certain and the least likely to vary widely from the normal. The fall for July is a little less than in June and not quite so well distributed. The records show three times as many periods of ten days without rain in July as in June. Beginning with August the decrease is quite rapid and fairly uniform through August. September and Octol&gt;er. In September there are fewer dashing rains than in the three preceding months. More of the rains are steady and rontliiw srveral While the total precipitation for the year is light in comparison with that of many of the other states, a larger proportion of it falls during the Browing season, April to August, and the rainfall of these months is much the most important of the year. "It is not the total precipitation of the year that favors vegetation (field crops as well as forests), but the amount that falls during the growing season. Thus a locality may have thirtv-five or forty inches of rain annually, but if most of it falls in . showers or during the winter, some trees and crops will flourish leal than where" an annual average of bu' twenty inches is made up largely of moderate spring and summer rains."' The aver,' il rainfall for Nebraska is 1B.42 inches, or 69 per cent of the annual. The percentage increases from east to west, being 67 per cent at Omaha and 73 per cent at North Platte. The comparative data in table No. 2 show that during the growing season the rainfall in much of Nebraska is fully equal to that of the states farther east. Table No. 2. — Seasonal Rainfall.

            <seg id="p285">285 By examining the record of annual precipitation we find that there ii a wide variation from year to year. From 1876 to 1907 it has varied from 57 to 135 per cent, of the normal. We may expect the variation at Krticular place to be greater than the average for the state. Be - ll averaging the state deficiency in one locality Is often equalized as In another. If we examine the record from 1850 to 1908, fifty-nine years, we find: Six very dry years (less than 70 per cent of the normal). Ten dry years (from 71 to 90 per cent of normal). Twenty-nine normal years (from 91 to 110 per cent of normal) Eleven wet years (from 110 to 130 per cent of ncrmal). Three very wet years (over 130 per cent of normal). In discussing this point and comparing the Nebraska record with the longest known records, Buda 176 years, Milan 137, Klagenfurt 88 years, Mr. G. A. Loveland says: "The conclusion seems to be a safe one that the number of wet and dry years in Nebraska will bear about the sum ratio to each other and to years of normal rainfall as might be ex - pected in most parts of the world."* This is not saying that Nebraska is or is not more subject to damaging drouths than the Eastern states. In much of the state the normal precipitation is very near the minimum limit for crop production, and in many western counties the normal is even below that limit, and profitable crops are produced only In the wet years. A reduction below the normal then is a much more serious matter than if the normal was far above the necessary amount. Iiny people have gained the impression that the rainfall has in - &gt;d since the state was settled and that cultivation of the soil has ht more rain. Statements to this effect have often and unwisely published. t A careful examination of the record shows that 1849 &gt;y far the wettest year of the sixty, and that the wettest ten-year 1 was 1849 to 1858, while in 1854 there was not more than a square of land under cultivation in the state.t The next ten-year period he driest, but only a little drier than the ten years from 1892 to 1901. We may reasonably expect a succession of wet years or a succession of dry years, but these fluctuations do not occur with any regularity. Dur - ing the ten years from 1849 to 1858 only one year had less than normal precipitation; of the next eighteen years, 1859 to 1876, only five had more than normal precipitation; of the nine years, 1877 to 1885, only two were below normal, then follows a period of fourteen years In which only two were wet, and of the last nine years, 1900 to 1908, four have been considerably above normal and none seriously dry.

Ks soil of Nebraska is mostly porous and very deep. It absorbs rapidly, holds it well and gives it up readily to plants. The of the land is generally not great; the average wind velocity is the average relative humidity is low. All of these conditions ae to make the runoff small and the evaporation great. The run-off for the state has commonly been estimated at one-tenth of the rainfall, and this is probably very nearly correct. The sag ings of the Niobrara river at Valentine show about 10 per cent of run-off; those of the Blue river at Manha'tan. Kan., 11 per cent: of the Loup river at Columbus somewhat higher: of the Republican river at Junction City, Kan., not over 3 per cent. The high run-off of the Loup river is no doubt due to the fact that a large part of its basin is sand hills, where the soil is too coarse to hold as much water as the finer soils and so porous that more of it sinks deep and gets beyond the reach of evapora - tion and plant roots. A large part of the Republican river basin llee in the semi-arid plains of Colorado. The Blue river basin is taken as an example because it lies wholly within a highly agricultural region, most of which is within the state, and the data for the rainfall and run-off are more complete than for any other basin. To get the pre - cipitation for the basin the means for these years for Hastings, Edgar, Fairmont, Seward, Hebron, Beatrice, Nebr., and Manhattan, Kan., have been taken. These stations represent comparatively equal areas and give ■y accurate average for the basin. The figures for the run-off have copied from l\ S. G. S. Water Supply Paper 96.

This shows a variation from 5.3 per cent of the rainfall, 1901, a dry season, to 20.8 per cent in 1903, a wet year. The run-off for May alone in 1903 was more than the total for four different years, and yet it was less than 20 per cent of the rainfall (12.82 inches) for that month. Much of the rainfall for May was, however, carried over and delivered in June, but the run-off for the two months was only 4.35 inches or 28 per cent of the rainfall, which was 15.35. The next highest run-off, 2.05 inches, occurred in July, 1902, but the rainfall of that month was 10.12 inches, making the run-off only 20 per cent. This month, too, was pre - ceded by a very wet June (9.34 inches) with comparatively little runoff i 74 inches). The run-off for the two months was only 14 per cent of the rainfall.

So well recog - nized are the relations of certain geological formations to water that in of this state well diggers depend implicitly upon their knowledge of the strata. For example, in Nebraska they always expect to find water at the bottom of the loess or drift, and the experienced digger will always stop when he strikes Pierre shale. He has no hope of rinding water in it. It our purpose the most important geological formations are those are exposed over the largest areas — those from which most of the of the state have teen formed. While many different formations [posed within our borders, those which have produced the soil over areas are few in number and of comparatively recent origin. Over of the state the exposed formations are so deep that we do not rn ourselves about what lies beneath. In ages past, parts of the territory which Nebraska now includes have In en covered by seas, lakes and glaciers. During each period deposits lieruliar to that time and condition were laid down, only to be washed and furrowed, and finally buried by later deposits. In the southeastern part of the Etate many of the newer deposits, if ever laid down, have been washed away, and so the oldest rocks within our borders are ex - posed there. Rocks of four different systems, comprising Carboniferous. Cretaceous. Tertiary and Quaternary ages, outcrop to greater or less extent in various parts of Nebraska. Rocks of Carboniferous age, composed mostly of limestones and clay, outcrop along the Missouri river from Blair south, along the Platte btiow Ashland, and along nearly all streams fit and south from Lincoln and Beatrice. These are the oldest formations exposed in the state and they have been almost entirely buried by later deposits. They now appear at the surface in small patches on a few hilltops in Richardson and Pawnee counties and along the banks of streams where the water has carried away the younger strata and left the old rocks bare. They have not formed the soils except In small patches, which arc frequently so stony as to be fit only for pasture. Their importance lies mainly in the limestone which is quarried at many points, the clays which are used for brick and tile, and in their relation to well water. Some thin veins of coal are also found in them. N&lt; \t in age comes the Cretaceous, which is: represented by many layers of sandstone, limestone, shale and clay. Dakota sandstones, sands and clays outcrop occasionally from Jefferson and G-ige counties north east to Dixon county. The rusty sandstone near the penitentiary at Lincoln, south of Fairbury, at Ashland, an,1 other points is representa - tive. This stone is used to some extent for building purposes. It is veiy porous and where Luried under other formations is usually satu - rated with water of fair quality.

The glacier which later covered the eastern counties, however, left that region more or leas hilly, and in places the plowing and piling done by the ice have been important factors in shaping the present topography. After the glacier melted away the loess was deposited over all or nearly all the eastern part of the state, and lapping far out on the Loup Fork beds to the west, leaving a smooth surface. But since that time the winds and the waters have worked great changes. The winds have blown the sands Into hills: they have gathered dust in one locality and dropped • Geography of Nebraska, by G.

In places they have dug out basins and in others have carried away the loose materials and left high buttes. and are still carrying on this work. Rivers have been cutting their valleys deep and wide and then redepositing sediment to rover their valley floors. The water from rains and snow has run down these slopes, cutting, at first, very little channels, which grew deeper and deeper and wider and wider as stream - lets united and the volume and power of the water increased till the main rivers were reached. The sides of the channels were rounded off into rolling hills and gentle slopes. This process is still going on. The eastern pan of the state is much the most completely worn into rounded hills, partly, at least, because it receives much the heaviest rainfall. Soils that are loose and dry on the surface are more easily blown than others, and therefore wind action has had the most marked effect in the drier and sandier sections, especially in the sand hill region and in the buttes of the Platte and White river bluffs. I account of the difference in texture of the different formations 'd, as well as the difference in climate, erosion has not had the effect in all sections. This has brought about the recognition of general toj&gt;ographic regions corresponding with the geological s— the Loess. San.i Hill. High Plains. Bad Lands — established by ebraska Geological Survey. The Loess region is characterized by hilly, rolling or level prairies, (•overt.! by a heavy growth of tall grass and belts of timber along the streams. Sand dunes and basin-shaped valleys are the characteristic forms of the Sand Hill Region. The High Plains Region is marked by level, fine sanely plains, covered by short grass, sand ridges and loamy valleys. The Bad Lands Region is marked by wind- and water-formed buties and barren tracts of clay, which are devoid of vegetation, mainly on account 01' the rapidity with which they are eroded. From* an agricultural, industrial or scientific standpoint, each of these regions naturally divides itself into several different areas which grade more or less insensibly into one another. The bluff areas along the Missouri and in places along the Platte and other streams, constst of hills with mostly steep slopes and lounded tops, often rising from 200 to 500 feet within a mile or two of the river bottoms. They do not usually extend more than one to three miles back. These areas on account of the steep slop«s and their liability to wash, are not well adapted to general farming, but are better fitted for producing fruit, timber and pasture.

ALTITUDE AND SLOPB The state is a portion of the great slope which extends eastward from the Rocky Mountains, and varies in altitude (height above sea level) from about 800 feet In the southeast corner to over 5,300 feet near the Wyom - ing line in Kimball and Banner counties. The average of the uplands near the Missouri river is about 1,100 feet, and along the western bound - ary about 4.700 feet. </seg>
            <seg id="p297">297 The eastward slope is much more rapid in the western portion than in the east, being about ten feet per mile for the western third, seven feet for the central third, and six feet for the eastern. The eastern part of the state also has a slight slope to the south, as is shown by the Elkhorn. Blue and Nemaha rivers. The slopes of the Platte and other valleys are considerably less than of the plain, for some of these valleys are cut about 1,000 feet deep In the western part, while the Missouri is only 100 to 200 feet below the level of the uplands. The slope is important only because it has determined the direction and velocity of streams, and so indirectly has largely determined the topog - raphy and influenced the location of railways and the directions which they take. From our standpoint the only importance of the elevation lies in its effect upon climate. As the altitude increases the temperature decreases; frosts romp later In the spring and earlier in the fall ana so make the season for growing crops shorter. When the temperature is the same, water evaporates faster in hisfcfr altitudes. This mean* that the farmer may need to take more care to cultivate to keep moisture in the soil, but it favors him in haying time hy drying the crop more quickly. DRAINAGE Most of the farmers of the state have no drainage problem, for drain age is more often above than below the needs. On most farms erosion does more damage than deficient drainage, and yet, in the aggregate, many thousands of acres are at present untillable because of deficient drainage. The amount of land that needs drainage is probably fully as great as that which needs irrigation and can be watered. All the run-off water finds its way cither directly or Indirectly Into the Mis - souri river. A small area drains directly into the Missouri river, but most of the waters reach it through other streams. Et most of the state the exposed formations are composed of a percentage of loose, porous silt or sand to an average depth of ly 100 fee', anl only n rira'l per cent (rarely more than 30) of These porous soils and subsoils absorb water rapidly and allow penetrate to a great depth. In most cases there is sufficient 5 drainage to carry off what excess of water there may be, but ly places in the river valleys, on the Loess Plains, the High Plains the Sand Hills surface drainage is deficient. I the level plains the water finds its way into intermittent ponds es. usually called "lagoons." These are usually small, but a few town which cover several square miles.

The most striking a littie surfa feature of the sand hill drainage, however, is the lakes. The sands are usually not deep in the valleys and the whole region is underlaid by more or less impervious beds. The water table stands above the bottoms many of these valleys and basins, forming perennial lakes. The water in these lakes is observed to rise in the fall as it also does in the streams. This curious phenomenon is no doubt due to the checking of euiperaiuies, and it is probable also that the evaporation by vicr rainfall o May to August, owing to the slow water trom Uted and raised tue water table in movement in the sand, has accum imiini seepage does not reach the the sands above normal, and the r :i streams and lakes till this tim is strongly alkaline.

We might perhaps more properly say soil moisture and soil texture, but soil moisture is so little understood that no ex - tended discussion of it will be attempted here. Rainfall, which has already been discussed. Is usually interpreted to mean soil moisture, but there is really a wide difference between the two. Soil moisture depends not alone upon the amount of rain but upon the time of year when it falls, the rapidity of the fall, the texture of the soil, the tillage, the plant growth, the dryness of the air, the wind velocity, the temperature of the air and the soil, and perhaps other factors. in a general way the soil areas of the state correspond to the area) geology, but each geological formation has produced several distinct types of soil. The type of soil has been affected in many places by topography and rainfall, so that in detail the characters of the soil are far from as uniform as the geological exposures. While there are extensive areas of vary uniform soil many distinct soil types occur within the state and there is a great difference between the soils of different localities. The Bureau of Soils in surveying 3,115 acres has recognized about thirty distinct soil types and a detailed survey of the state on the same scale would probably show nearly 100 different soils. The soil types covering large areas of agricultural land are not very numerous and in order to avoid the confusion arising from the use of a large number of types, the writer has aimed to discuss the soils under the more important type* only, and refer to other types simply as variations of the more extensive ones </seg>
            <seg id="p301">301 i The soil map has been made mainly from personal knowledge but personal inspection of more than 2,100 townships has been possible; therefore it has been necessary to depend upon others for details regard - ing many localities. All known sources of information, both published and unpublished, have been consulted. Probably over one thousand different persons have Leen interviewed and have furnished more or less information which has been used in the construction of the map. On a map of this scale it is not practical to go into sufficient detail to* show variations of less than three miles in width, and in only a few instances, mostly along the river valleys, has any attempt been made to show smaller or narrower areas. In all cases where small areas of distinctly different soils occur in more or less alternating patches, the map shows what seems to be the dominant or prevailing type. No great accuracy is claimed for this map and a detailed survey would doubtless show many errors. Vet it is believed to be sufficiently accurate to give a more definite idea of the soils prevailing in any locality than anything that has heretofore been published, and to serve a useful purpose till something better can be produced. (Chart No. 8.) For the purpose of discussion the soils of the state will be grouped in a general way as follows: Soils formed from Lot Els formed from Glacial Drift is formed from sandstones.

Loess soils probably cover at least 30,000 square miles. These soils are extremely uniform in character for such large areas, are richly stocked with all the mineral elements of plant food, especially potash, and well provided with humus and nitrogen. An abundance of lime is usually present.

It is this soil that has made Nebraska a great producer of corn, winter wheat, oats, alfalfa, and hogs, and a preat agricultural state. Residents of Nebraska should not fail to appre - ciate the wonderful possibilities which this soil offers to them. In the eastern part of the state alone the Missouri river, especially in Washington, noi'glas. Sarpy. and Cass counties, the land is quite rolling, and the surface soil, together with much of the humus, has been removed by erosion, thus changing slightly the color and texture and leaving a slightly, heavier, stickier, lighter colored soil of somewhat different crop adaptations On this account this soil, while only slightly different in appeannce from the Marshall silt loam, has been termed the Miami silt loam The Pur-pan of Soils in surveying Sarpy county recognized fifl,fi9fi acres of this tvpo. nearly half of the county. The Miami silt loam is on1v a variation of the Marshall silt loam from which it has been derived For this reason and because of its indefinite limits and the irregular tracts in whi^h it occurs, it has not seemed best to try to designate these areas on the map. Biilar variations are found in other localities, especially in Boone . Frontier, and Lincoln counties and other rolling sections. In places the subset] contains more sind than the soil and in some more clav. so the deri^pd type may be either heavier or lighter *ip soil of th»&gt; uneroded areas. Khin the Loess Region there are also a number of small areas of such as occvr south of the Platte river near Kearney, west of bus north of Grand Island and at other places Most of these seem to have been brought down from the sand hills by the s and b'own out nf their channels In manv nlares around the borders the Marshall silt loam grades insenslblv into the adtoinintr tvpe This is especially true on the west. A detailed sunrev would doubtless maVe it necessary to classify consider - able areas along the western limit of the loess as sinrtv loam which are liere mapped as silt lo»m.

            <seg id="p305">305 these hills are quite sticky, as may be seen east of Ewing in Holt and Antelope counties. In other places the hills are sandy and the valleys and level lands typical silt loam. These variations are produced largely but not entirely by the encroachment of the drifting sands upon the heavier soils. Some of the mixing, no doubt, was done while the loess was being deposited. So far as possible these transition lands, which grade on the one side into silt loam and on the other into dune sand, are indicated on the map (legend No. 6). Iiese areas are generally gently rolling to heavily rolling, and the of the hills is suggestive of wind action. The soils are silt loam. loam, clayey sand, or fine sand. They are largely but not all le. The heaiver areas are well adapted to corn, potatoes, and alfalfa, he sandier tracts are fit only for grazing and grade into typical dunes. In the northern part of the state the loess thins out and disappears towards the west in northern Antelope, western Knox. and eastern Holt counties. The drift disappears almost simultaneously with the loess, but extends considerably beyond it in Keya Paha county. The Arikaree or western deposit thins out towards the east in the same region (legend No. 8). This mixing of geological formations gives a peculiarly spotted country, mostly covered by a fertile sandy loam soil which in places gives way to sand and in other places, mostly along the creek banks, to gumbo. In some places the subsoil is fine loess making very valuable land, but where the soil is underlain by gravel or coarse sand, as is often the case, the crops are very subject to injury from drouth. SOILS DERIVED FROM GLACIAL DRIFT. In many of the eastern counties, especially Bulter, Saunders, Lan - caster, Johnson. Pawnee, Otoe, and western Richardson, there are num - erous irregular areas from which the loess if ever deposited, has been washed away, exposing the glacial drift. The soil formed from the drift is mostly classified as Marshall loam (legend No. 2). Most of these areas are too small and too irregular to be indicated on the map, but the larger tracts have been designated. Johnson and Pawnee counties prob - ably have more of this type than of any other. The Bureau of Soils found 96.576 acres of Marshall loam in surveying Lancaster county. Small areas also appear in many places north of the Platte river from Boyd county east, but the total area within the state probably does not much exceed 2,000 square miles. tse glacial deposits, as previously stated, are made up of rs. gravel, sand, silt, and clay, arranged in beds in no conceivable or Indiscriminately mixed. In many places, also, the loess from has been washed down the slopes and mixed with the drift. Most soils formed are rich, dark loam or sandy loam, but many patches vy clay are also found, although these are generally not extensive, of sand and gravel also occur. The Marshall loam can usually be ized by the sand, gravel, or occasional bowlders which it contains. </seg>

It is more productive than the uplands and accordingly is valued much higher. It is on these terraces that most of the alfalfa of the Platte and Repub - lican valleys is grown.

In western Nebraska there are considerable areas of second bottom, or terrace land, along the Lodge Pole and Pumpkin Seed creeks and the North Platte river (legend No. 4). These soils are derived mostly from the Brule clay and the Ogallala and Arikaree formations through which these streams have cut their channels. These formations are all more or less sandy, and as a result the soils formed from them are mostly sandy loams, with some areas of sand. The soils of these terraces are, for the most part, deep, fertile and easily tilled. They are very valuable where irrigation has been established, being capable of producing large yields of all the crops suited to the climate. They seem especially well adapted to alfalfa, sugar beets, oats, and potatoes. SOILS OF THE HIGH PLAINS.

The soils of these areas, aside from the sand ridges, are mostly sandy loams, ten to twenty inches deep, underlaid with subsoil made up mostly of fine sand and a small percentage of clay. On account of the loose surface, water is absorbed quickly by these soils, and pentetrates them deeply, but evaporation from them is slow; hence they are the most drouth resistant soils of the region.

On valley, hill and dale, on heavy soil and light, the state over, excepting rn a few localities, corn stands first and foremost. In 1897 Nebraska took first rank among the states as a corn producer. This proud dis - tinction was not. however, to be retained, but i)ie average crop since that time shows Nebraska to be the third corn state, giving place only to Illinois and Iowa, and producing more than one-thirteenth of the total corn crop of the country. The annual crop now amounts to over 175.000, - 000 bushels. The average yield of corn in the state for the forty years ending in 1907 was a trifle over thirty bushels per acre, and has varied from six bushels in the drouth year of 1S94 to forty-two bushels in 1869 and 1878. By decades the yields have been 32.7. 33.8. 26.7 and 27.1 bushels, respec - tively. The decrease in yield per acre in the last two decades has been marked. The shortage in 1888 to 1897 was partly due to the unusual number of dry seasons during that period. But that is not true of the last ten years. There are at least three factors evident which seem to have been responsible for these lower yields. First, until about twenty years ago nearly all the (ultivatPd land was i-n the east half of the state, which is by far the nest adapted to the production of corn. Since that time large areas farther west have been brought into cultivation. The western half of the state gets much less rain than the eastern, and. there - fore, a much lower average yield of corn, thus reducing the state average. Second, much of the farm land has now been devoted to crops for from thirty to fortv years consecutively, and some fields have grown corn for twenty years or more without a change. At least a large portion of this land has never been fertilized in any way. or ro f ated with grans or any leguminous crop. This continuous drain has told upon the native fertility and upon the yields. There is no statistical evidence to prove this point but it is a matter of common observation that land which has been cultivated enly a few years is out-yielding older fields. It is also a matter of common observation that where corn follows clover or alfalfa, the yields are greatly increased Bird, root worms and root lice have increased rapidly the last few and have greatly reduced the yeilds of many fields. The decrease Ids is the more significant when we rememher that it has occurred le of the great improvement in cultivation, and the very decided im - nent in varieties and in the selection of seed. Effects of the Distribution of Rainfall on the Yield Eth the possible exception of tillage, the time of rainfall is the most tant factor controlling the yield of corn.

Wheat Is the second grain crop of the state, both in acreage and In value. While it has always been one of the first three crops, it has been much more prominent the last eight years, but still its acreage is only about one-third that of corn. In the early history of the state winter va - rieties were tried but were not successful because the varieties were not sufficiently hardy to withstand the winters. Spring varieties were grown almost exclusively for many years, but over much of the territory spring whea' was never a satisfactory crop, and in many of the southern counties its growth had been practically abandoned several years before hardy winter wheat was secured. I the early 80's Turkey Red winter wheat was introduced from Kan This variety proved hardy and was soon widely distributed over the eastern counties. It was a profitable crop from the first, much more ihle than spring wheat ever hnd In en. It increased rapidly in and worked its way north and west till now it is grown to some t in every farming county, and has almost entirely displaced spring in all the south half of the state, except in the western counties . -It hi OT^at A t til </seg>

There are, however, certain other influences that can not he overlooked. Spring wheats have given better satisfaction in the north than in the south, and oats are a more profitable crop. The harvest of spring grain does not interfere with corn cultivation as does that of winter wheat. The straw, too, is valuable for feed while winter wheat straw is almost useless except for bedding.

While potatoes are grown on nearly every farm in the state for home consumption, in most places they are not a general market crop, and frequently are not grown in sufficient quantities to supply the local demand. Only a few counties produce a surplus and several counties must always import. Some potatoes are shipped into the state every year and some are shipped out. On the average, production and con - sumption are probably about equal. Over 90 per cent, of the crop Is consumed within the county producing it. (fact that on most farms potatoes are grown for home con - on only accounts for the remarkably even distribution shown by No. 16. Still four distinct potato centers must be recognized: a and Sarpy counties which produce potatoes for market hi the Omaha; Dakota county, which markets its crop just across the n Sioux City; the northwest, where potatoes are grown for export; ott's Bluff county, where irrigation has made the crop a success. 11 </seg>

This is a larger acreage than had been planted since 1900, but less than for a number of years preceding that date. The greater part of the state is not especially adapted to potato culture, yet good yields of good tubers can be produced in all sections. It is here more a ques - tion of the inclination of the farmer than of adaptability of soil and climate. There is more heavy work connected with potato culture than with the more common field crops, and most farmers wish to avoid this Icept in the northwest, potatoes are usually of minor importance or that reason are generally poorly tended. There are, however, red over the state in nearly every county, potato growers who make profits per acre on potatoes than is common on other crops. facts show that potatoes intelligently handled are among our most ible crops.

At one time it was thought by some that sugar production would sweep everything else before it. but beets have never become a popular crop. Of the three factories that started in the state, two, for one reason or another, have been closed. Beets have been grown by a few farmers in many counties besides in the vicinity of the factories at Grand Island. Ames and Norfolk, and usually good profits have been made. Some of the serious difficulties with the crop are: I.abor is often hard to get; there is much heavy work; the crop is very different from any to which the farmers have &gt;een accustomed or for which they were equipped. In the irrigated •alleys of the west, beets will probably become one of the most important crops as soon as factories are available. The soil and climate are well adapted to sugar production: the yields are large; and the high price of land will necessitate the production of the most remunerative crops. </seg>

Buckwheat has been grown in a few scattered patches each year, but has never gained any importance in any locality. Only fair yields were secured and the crop was very uncertain. Before the introduction of alfalfa, buckwheat was grown mainly as a honey plant, but in this respect alfalfa is so far superior that there serr p little need for buckwheat, and it will probably soon disappear entirely. Only about 1,000 acres were re - ported last year. In summer and fall the weather is too warm and dry spells are too frequent for this plant to thrive. TRUCK. Trucking is an undeveloped industry in Nebraska and the opportuni - ties are large. Thus far the Nebraska farmer has scorned "truck" and preferred to give his attention to larger fields and more staple products. The high prices of land now prevailing will doubtless call more attention to various phases of trucking and other more intensive systems of man - agement. Truck crops have never received any attention except for local consumption, and there are few towns in the state that are not obliged to import vegetables that might be easily and profitably produced in the vicinity. There is no trucking of any consequence except in the im - mediate vicinity of some of the larger cities. At a few points along the Republican and Platte rivers, sweet potatoes have been ktowb for shipment in a small way. Nebraska should grow sweet potatoes at least for her own markets. Canning factories for putting up tomatoes, sweet corn. etc.. have been established at many points and a number are now doing a thriving business, among which are Peru. Nebraska City, Beatrice. Fairbury. Tomatoes are a profitable crop everywhere. It is probable that cabbage and onions will become important crops in the North Platte valley. SEEDS. In a few localities the production of garden seeds under contract for seed dealers has received a good deal of attention. Large quantities of cucumbfr. melon, squash and sweet corn seed have been grown at Albion. Rlchland. Waterloo, Lincoln, and other points. This industry is capable of great extension, especially in the sandy valleys of the northwest. </seg>

            <seg id="p326">326 difficulty experienced in growing other roughage. Sorghum is more popular in the south half of the state on account of the shor of the season farther north. On the north the crop is limited by tem - perature and length of season. On the east the limiting factor is the -s of 1 etter forage crops, such as alfalfa, clover, etc. I the western counties sorghum is often planted with the lister and ated like corn, only it is closer together in the row. When planted way it is cut with the corn binder. This produces coarser fodder the thicker seeding but is much more certain in the drier sect ler east where there is usually more rain, this crop is sown broad or drilled dose together with the grain drills. The method of ing is controlled by the humidity of the climate. Sorghum has the reputation of being very hard on the ground and for this reason many farmers dislike to use it. The effect on the field is probably due to the fact that it is a \igorous feeder and a heavy producer. It also exhausts the water very completely from the soil late in the season, as well as the available plant food, so that if timely spring rains do not come, the following crop has small chance. On ac - count of not being harvested till nearly ripe it reseeds badly. The seed retains its vitality well in the ground and it is usually several ye:&gt;rs before a field that has been planted to sorghum is entirely free from the seed. It is not a rare thing where small grain has followed sorghum to see sorghum spring up in the stubljle after harvest and make a fodder Ben the growth of sorghum is checked by drouth, frost or any other the plant often becomes poisonous and is almost instantly fatal to and sheep.

This clover has a distinct advantage in the readiness with which it re - seeds in meadows, fields and pastures.

A few days of hot weather in July or August stops their growth entirely. Blue-grass makes an excellent pasture in the valleys of the ..-astern counties, where it grows early and late and furnishes a large amount of feed, but is not productive on most uplands. It has now run wild and takes possession of all favorable places in meadows and in pastures both native and tame.

ALFALFA No plant ever introduced has attracted so much attention in all parts of the state and spread so rapidly as alfalfa. No other plant :■! Turkey Red wheat has so changed the agriculture of the state in so short a time. Alfalfa has been a veritable gold mine to the farmers of many counties and has been one of the main factors in bringing about the prosperous condition which they now enjoy. Had this won - derful crop been known to the early settlers, the state's history would have been entirely different. Alfalfa has already revolutionized stock tig and without doubt will soon become the most important forage of the state. (Chart No. 19.) Alfalfa . = 500 A. Less than 250 A. blank. The acreage of alfalfa is increasing by leaps and bounds. The in - crease in the last year was nearly 22 per cent and in the last four years 132 per cent. The crop of 1908 was 1,846,703 tons from 547,557 acres. Alfalfa in Nebraska is still in its infancy; a beginning only has been made. In the majority of counties it has scarcely passed the intro - ductory stage. More than half of the farmers do not know how to grow it; not half realize its feed value; and not one in a hundred knows its worth as a fertilizer. It is not visionary to suggest that in the near future alfalfa may almost rival corn as the most important and valuable crop in the state, and at the same time by its improvement of the soil greatly increase all other crops. Kie average yield of alfalfa hay for the state is about three tons per which is usually worth $5 to $8 in the stack. Almost any good corn should produce three to five tons and yields of eight tons are known. «s return of $40 to $50 an acre for hay is not rare. </seg>
            <seg id="p333">333 a Four crops of bay a year are produced in the southeast counties, and the number diminishes north and west as the temperature and rainfall decrease. Three crops are usually cut in the northeast, while in the extreme western part there is no assurance of more than one crop, except in wet valleys or where irrigated. ■ the southeast, cutting commences May 20 to June 5. The second is ready in about forty days, and the other crops require a few longer. The last crop Is cut the later part of October. A large amount of seed is now being grown in the state, especially in the vicinity of Kearney. Some seed is grown in all parts, but in the Plane valley a specialty is made of it. Three to four bushels is a fair crop, and a few yields of sixteen bushels have been reported. Returns of over $100 an acre from seed alone have been known, but $20 is prob - ably near the average. It requires al.out the same time to grow one seed crop as is required for two hay crops. Ialfa seldom seeds heavily if the ground is moist enough to produce i hay crop. It requires comparatively dry weather to seed well, t in dry seasons seed crops are not likely to average as valuable as rops east of about Hastings, but in dry seasons good crops have known even in the river counties. When we know more about •ing seed it may possibly become a very profitable crop even in stern part of the state. I the western counties a few farmers are now sowing alfalfa in three feet apart and cultivating it much as corn is tended. So far ■suits secured have given experimenters high hopes of producing ible crops of seed by this method on land that is too dry (or il cultivation, but this practice is as yet only in the experimental Bis not long since fall seeding began to be practiced, but it has success from the start, much more successful than spring seeding the eastern counties and in all parts when sufficient moisture has resent to give the plants a good start. Where crab grass abounds, jiling should always be resorted to. Moat Nebraska soils are more or less completely inoculated for alfalfa, but the more the subject is studied the more cases are found where inoculation is needed. Inoculation is absolutely necessary in but few fields, though there are many places in the state and probably in every county where inoculation would be profitable. The places most likely to need inoculation are old, badly worn fields, sandy soils, tops of hills or any places that have been badly eroded. Nearly all of the drift soil* (see soil map) need inoculation. Because one farm grows alfalfa is no as - surance that the next does not need inoculation; one field may need inoculation and the next not; one part of a field may be well inoculated and the other part devoid of inoculation Such fields have been seen in many places. The bottoms of draws or any hollows where storm water </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 Many fields are seen where the plants live but make little growth; inns are few, sliori and weak; the leaves are pale, flowers are few, and little or no hay is produ°ed. The.se are almost sure signs that inoculation is needed. In these fields there is generally an occasional plant that is good color and thrifty. Examination will show that these plants are inoculated. If the uninoculated plants pass the winter (which ■&gt;t at all certain ) they may struggle through the next season and will u.sually liecome inoculated lielore fall, but the use of the field has lost. It has taken two years of time and work to get the alfalfa started. The writer has examined such fields on sandy soils northwest of Valentine, east of Ewing and north of Kenesaw, on Marshall silt loam at Lincoln, north of Falls City and other places, on drift soils near Crab Orchard, Sterling, etc., on Wabash silt loam at Hed Oak, Iowa, but not in Nebraska. Inoculation may be accomplished by scattering 300 pounds or more to the acre of soil from a good alfalfa field, or by the use of pure culture furnished free by the I". S. Department of Agriculture. It may also be accomplished by scattering manure which contains alfalfa. Spreading manure sometime before seeding, whether alfalfa hay has been fed or a great help in securing a stand. Bl accompanying chart shows the distribution of alfalfa over the Where the dots are grouped it means that the alfalfa is mostly t locality. Webster and Buffalo counties lead, with forty-one acres o the square mile. The influences controlling the distribution of this crop are numerous and many of them not yet determined, because alfalfa has not yet as - 1 its proper position as a crop. Alfalfa came to us from the West it was grown either under irrigation or on subirrigated land. Along with it came the opinion that alfalfa could be grown only under conditions. A worse mistake could not have been made, neverthe - less, this opinion almost limited this valuable crop to such valleys until the last few years. Nebraska farmers are now pretty well rid of this error. In Nebraska, alfalfa thrives practically anywhere where corn will thrive and in many places where corn will not. Alfalfa must have at least three feet to water, and better six, but it is not at all necessary that ground water be in reach of the roots. In the drier parts of the state, six to twelve feet of soil over ground water seems to be the best. It is not probable that alfalfa is often greatly benefited by ground water if the moisture does not rise freely to within less than fifteen feet from the surface. In other words, the depth to which roots commonly go does not seem to exceed fifteen feet. Alfalfa thriv in all the central and eastern counties. The chart - far tin -t acreage in the central counties, but this is no assurance that nose counties are best adapted to it.

            <seg id="p335">335 from the west it spread to the uplands as soon as the humid sec'ion reached, the western limit of which corresponds very closely to the liMUh meridian. I'ntil alfalfa was introduced, the central counties had itisfactory legume, but in the eistern counties oolver was well estab - lished, and so the progress of alfalfa was less rapid, though none the &gt;»rtain. The spread of alfalfa in the eastern part of the state has also been retarded by the fact that pome difficulty has been experienced in getting it started, especially on the rolling land, the drift soils and on badly worn fields. PASTURES Bthe better agricultural portions of the state pastures are largely ■d to the more rolling lands and the wet bottoms, but on a large f the farms there is nothing but good tillable land. The majority tnanent pastures have never been broken, and consist of native Is. mostly bluestcm. In all the farming counties from Phelps and past the dominant grass is the big blnestem { Andrtpogon fw in varying proportions, according to lo-al conditions, with bunch or little bluestem ( Antfropugnn sropariiisi, bushy bluestem (Chry - &gt;n WMltm), needle grass ifttipa). an&lt;l many other grasses and i'rrm Knox.

In go " - estward buffalo - (Bulbilis rlactlyloirles) and grama grass (Btmtetomm oHgostnrhya ami hirsuta) are first seen in pastures in about the same region as mentioned above for wheat grass. They form patches which are found mostly on the tops of hills or on the heavier, more alkaline lands l&gt;ordering the lagoons. These grasses increase in importance to the vard and become dominant on the "hard" land from Keya Paha and tr counties west, while the hunch grass often dominates the rough and sandy land especially along the canon banks.

This is very noticeable around the borders of lagoons and in many places on the rough land along the str«'ims. especially in the northern counties. The buffalo and prama start somewhat earlier than the bluestems as does also the alkali grass. The pastures on the river bottoms generally furnish feed alsout seven to ten days earlier than those of the uplands. In the western and northern counties there is a larger proportion of early grasses so pasturing is no! delayed so long in these parts as might le expected from the difference in climate and the differ - fnce in the advancement of crops. The pastures in the northern and nothwestern counties are only about one or two weeks behind those of itheastern counties and often not that. In all parts pastures are at their best in June The grasses become harder in the latter part of .Iiilv and. if dry weather occurs, often be - come poor in August, but generally support stock till about October 1. The bluestems and sand hill grasses are killed by the first hard froot and are of little value afterwards. Where buffalo and grama grass predominate, pasturing the dead crass continues more or less all winter, but as more farming is done and more rough feed becomes available 1mb dependence is placed upon winter pasture. These grasses, when not over pastured, furnish very good feed through the winter providing very little rain has fallen to bleach and leach them. All the native pastures furnish good feed when in their prime and stock fattens rapidly on them, but (his period is short. The sandhills furnish good summer pastures, but not much in the winter, except on the heavier soils where grama and buffalo grass grow. For winter feed the sandhill ranchmen depend largely on the hay which they cut in the valleys. The majority of stockmen want about one and one-half tons of hay per head. Where "hard" land is close at hand it is a common prac - tice to summer the stock in the sandhills and winter it on the short grasses of the "hard" land. In all the better farming sections of the state pastures have quite generally heen over-stocked and many of them much damaged. When overstocked the legumes are practically all killed "and the bluestems thinned out, while the less valuable grasses and weeds take their places. Among the worst of the weeds are the golden rods, the iron weeds, the rag weeds (Ambrosina). and the verbanes. These can largely be kept in check by mowing, whereever the topography will permit. Most pastures never receive any care whatever. In all the southeastern counties blue-grass and white clover have romp into native pastures and have generally improved the quality of feed and considerably lengthened the season. In the river valleys are many pastures where these grasses are in almost complete control. On such lands they make excellent pasture. </seg>

Some of the eastern counties have more cattle to the square mile than some of the ranch counties could support if their entire area was given over to the production of cattle. A good many of the cattle in the eastern count us were not raised there, but were shipped in as feeders On the first of April, however, the date to which figures apply, the number of cattle in feed yards is comparative small Part of the large number in Merriek county is due to the fact that one of the largest feeding companies in the world has its plant there. There is a noticeably smaller number of cattle in the counties where the most winter wheat is grown. This is exactly what should \pected. for winter wheat produces no feed for cattle, while all the B crops provide roughage which has but little other use.

Not only does the distribution of control the distribution of hogs but the amount of corn as well the number of hogs raised. Nebraska ranks third among the Hogs, April 1, 1908 . = 500. states as a corn producer and third in the number of hogs. Alfalfa is each year becoming a more important factor in hog raising and has considerable influence on the number of hogs raised, especially along the Republican river and its tributaries. (Chart No. 22.) HOBSES. While there are some large horse ranches in the state, these animals are mostly work stock and so are distributed over the state, a small number on each farm. Many horses are annually shipped out of Ne - braska, although their production for market is a specialty on but few farms and ranches. Most of the colts are raised from brood mares which are at the same time work animals. The surplus horses are nearly all produced from these mares as a secondary consideration. The number of horses is, therefore, very closely related to the number of acres under cultivation. The ratio of horses, however, to the area of farm land is by no means in all parts of the state. (Chart No. 23.) SHEEP. Sheep are not grown in any considerable numbers in Nebraska except on the high plains commencing in Perkins county and extending west and north around the sand hills to Cherry county. In the southeast half of the state sheep are produced only in isolated flocks of little importance. However, farmers who are raising sheep in this section CHART No. 22. </seg>

Horses and miMe . = 500. DAIRYING. In the last ten or fifteen years Nebraska has made rapid strides in dairying and has become an important butter producer. During the advt rse seasons of the early 90's many farmers began selling cream from necessity and finding it profitable have continued the practice. There are few large dairies and few exclusively dairy farms except near the larger cities, but a large proportion of the farmers milk five to ten cows and sell the cream. The total number of milk cows is about 700,000 or approximately one to every two persons. These cows are, for the most part, neither dairy animals nor given dairy care. They are mostly beef breeds, and are kept to make use of the pasture lands and the coarse feed that would otherwise go to waste. The calf is on the average about as important as the cream. For these reasons the average yield of butter fat is very low, but the conditions are improving and the yield of fat is increasing perceptibly. Ke sale of cream is not confined to any particular section, but of 1 the greatest production per square mile is in the better agricul - counties. In the western portions and in the sandhills cream cans he depot platforms during the pasture season. In these sections CHART No. 2: </seg>

TRANSPORTATION AND MARKETS Over the southeast half of the state the prevalence of gentle slopes, obviating the necessity of deep cuts, hieh fills and steep grades, the small number of streams to le bridged, the absence of rock, the ease with which the soil is worked, the absence in most places of all tend - ency to creep or slide when piled up. and the comparative firmness of the roadbed formed from it. have all worked together to cheapen and facili - tate railroad construction and maintenance, and render transportation easy. This region is now well supplied with railroad facilities, there being comparatively few farms that are as much as ten miles from a shipping point In some of the northern counties a lack of railroad transportation still retards agricultural development, and much of the High Plains in the western counties is far from market. This is not due to the difficulties of construction but to the sparse settlement and limited amount of business. Only one railroad has as yet pierced the great sand hill belt Here the drifting sands make maintenance difficult and the unproductive character of the snil keeps tonnage at a minimum There are. however, many fertile tracts in this region that would be much better utilized if transportation could be obtained. In the sand hills wagon roads arc men 1 trails in the sand, and hauling over them is extremely laborious. The valleys could produce large quantities of potatoes and hay but it is impossible to haul such crops far over these roads Improvement of these roads is not yet feasible in most places. Heavier materials are not at hand and the expense of constructing regular highways would be prohibitive. The commonest method of improving sand roads is to cover them with hay or coarse fodder. In some places soap weeds (Yucca) are used in the same way with excellent results, the roots being especially adapted to this purpose Hay is generally cheap and plenty and the inhabitants hay" the roads as well as the cattle In nearly all the agricutulra! wctkwi of the state good wagon road* are quite uniformly found on section lines The same conditions which h«Te favored railroad construction have Rtm Nebraski probably the best wagon roads in the United States for the amount of work and expense that has been nut upon them There are seldom more than • few days at a time when good loads cannot be hauled over them These roads, however, are capable of great improvement at small ex- </seg>

Sioux City and St. Joseph. From the west half of the state they go largely to Denver and other western markets. Cattle and sheep go to Omaha and Chicago. Horses go to Chicago and other eastern and southern points. Most of the grain that goes out finds its way to Omaha, Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis, but some corn goes to the feeders in Colorado. Hay is marketed largely in Omaha and Kansas City. Grain is seldom shipped I y tin- producer hut is sold to local elevators. which are branch houses for large grain dealers in Omaha and other central points. Elevators are operated by local companies at a good many points. Nearly every railroad sidetrack has one or more elevators. Cattle and sheep are mostly shipped by the owners, but hogs are often sold to local buyers, who ship whenever a carload is secured. POPULATION About three-fifths of the population of the state reside upon farms, and nearly all the rest are engaged in business, which is directly de - pendent upon agriculture.

West of the clover limit there has been almost no attempt at rotation with alfalfa, although some fields have been plowed up, but rotation is needed almost as badly and the good effects are always shown. On a large proportion of the farms there should be no permanent pasture on good farm land but on many farms such pastures can profitable he maintained. Some of the best farmers now sow clover in all small grain even though the stubble is to be plowed for winter wheat or corn. This practice is to be highly commended. It is not uncommon to get three - fourths to one ton of hay, or one-half to one bushel of seed, to the acre after the grain is off. If it is not desirable to cut hay or seed, a large •mount of pasture is almost always furnished, and in every case where a stand is secured the fertility added to the soil is worth several times the cost of the seed and work.

Any land that will produce alfalfa should be seeded to It, and probably with proper care this crop can be grown on nearly all land? where general farming is possible. The experiments with alfalfa in rows three or throe and a half feet apart and cultivated as regularly as corn, are giving flattering Eults, and where it is too dry for the ordinary seeding, it seems almost tain that this method will produce valuable seed crops and at the ne time some feed. Kit of the soils of the dry region are short of nitrogen and humus, alfalfa ran be grown for a few years the land will surely produce crops of other kinds. The writer is personally familiar with a Held of alfalfa on the plains near the west line of Nebraska which l 1894. In the summer of 1908 the native grasses which had taken sion were more than twice as thick and tall on this patch as on the ider of the field. In irrigated fields on the plains of Colorado of grain are commonly doubled where alfalfa has been grown. This system, of course, could not be followed exactly in all the western counties, but it could easily be varied to meet the local conditions. On the sandier lands summer tillage can not be practiced and winter wheat does not stand well. Corn, sorghums, emmer and rye must be the main reliance. In much of the rough country of the western and northwestern counties, and in the sand hills, nothing but stock production seems possible, but even here, where near enough to a station, the small stock - man or "Kinkaider" will find it almost necessary to sell cream. In the sand hills hay is usually plenty and where the settler has valleys that will grow clover, alfalfa or peas, milking should be profitable. In many of these valleys potatoes may be made an important source of income, but in some places the distance to market and the difficulties of hand - ling make them impossible as a market crop.

There was u time when it was thought impossible for people to lire in the country and yet have the conveniences anil pleasures of the people ill the city. The principal conveniences to be missed by the ruralile of a few years ago were the lighting systems, water systems, sewage systems, and postal delivery. Today all these can be had by the farmer who cares to investigate them and have them installed in his home. The mail is now left at his door once a day. By the use of acetylene or gasoline he can have a modern heating and lighting plant of his own or if he prefers to install a gasoline engine and storage-battery he may use electricity about the farm. It has been thought by a great many people .&amp;&gt; that an elevated tank for water systems must needs be thirty or forty troni the ground. This is an erroneous idea, for by means of the proper piping a tank only a lew feet from the ground will he of good service, or what is belter a pressure tan!; placed in the cellar or a pit brings to the farmer the pleasure of having water throughout his build - ings and yards. By having the proper waier systems about the place the disposal of sewage becomes a very simple matter. Consequently the farmer of today by investing three or four hundred dollars can have all of the pleasures of his city neighbor and yet live on his farm where he can be in direct charge of all operations.

The soil of Nebraska is of such a nature that it washes freely, then too the topography of the land is such that water moves the land very slowly. Besides this water which gathers in ponds ry seldom changed, consequently nearly all the water of Nebraska i is stagnant and not fit for house use unless it is filtered two or times. 12 BY L. W. CHASE. </seg>
            <seg id="p354">354 The streams of Nebraska in general are very much like the ponds. The water in them moves very slowly, is generally muddy and of such a nature that only in rare cases can it be used for stock and house use Of course the water from the streams can be tillered in the same manner that it can be from the ponds but this scheme is generally trying and somewhat expensive. Considering the area of the state of Nebraska it has very few springs, however a great many farms have these and they should be considered as a source of water supply in a great many instances. Springs furnish water which is as pure as that of any other source, consequently, where - ever convenient it is well to develop them. A great many people believe that a spring is a small stream of water which is flowing through a channel for a great distance back in a hill or bank from which it issues. It is very seldom that this is the case. They are generally simply an outlet to a very wet place in the adjoining ground. Often where the t seeps out of the side of a hill or the bank of a stream a good can Le formed by working back into the earth for a short distance lowing the water to gather in a tank or small reservoir. It will ow off in a small stream where before it was simply seeping away, are a great many instances where springs may be developed in this r and the very best source of water be obtained. Ehe second of the general sources for supply of water on the farm the one most universally used is wells. These will be divided into ! classes — shallow, deep, and artesian. There is no definite line to rawn between shallow and deep wells as far as the depth is con - ed. The geology of the soil in which the well is sunk does more to e this line than the depth of the well. For instance, a shallow well ■nerally known as one which is dug in a slough, hollow, or canyon. The water in any water bearing soil is held there by means of a permiable layer of soil beneath the layer of soil in which the water stands and generally the soil in a slough or hollow is washed in, con - sequently, if there is water to be found by sinking a well in such a place It is because of the fact that the water seeps down from the surface until it strikes this impermeable layer of soil and there is held. Often the flow in a well sunk in such a place as this seems inexhaustible, however, in nearly all cases If caret ul observation is made it will be noticed that the water in such a well fluctuates in about the same proportion that the amount of rainfall varies and if a very long drought takes place the chances are that the well would become completely dry. Another thing to be guarded against in the location of such a well is the proximity of yards, stagnant pools, vaults, and in fact anything of an unsanitary nature. In such wells as these the water seeps through the ground only for a short distance and consequently is not properly filtered and at a result is liable to carry disease with it. Deep wells can be dug upon elevations or in low places and yet be known by that name. Generally what is known as a deep well is one </seg>
            <seg id="p355">355 tgoes through several different kinds of soil and finally enters a hich is known as carrying sheet water. These wells are to be 1 wherever possible. ThPir supply is inexhaustible, the purity of .ter is unquestionable except that it might have some mineral ma - in suspension which pive it an unsavory odor or taste. These and tastes are generally due to the fact that there are certain ils mixed through the soil through which this water permlatea it finally reaches its lowest level. Such waters are generally more ental for mechanical purposes than for any other. Artesian wells can only be utilized in a few small sections of the state, hence, will not be considered here. The location of wpIIs is a vital point in many localities. However, if those parties desiring to dig wells where the question of obtaining water is very doubtful would give the subject of geology a little thought they would often save themselves many dollars and a great deal of time. Often when a set of farm buildings are situated between two sloughs or creeks, the farmer feels that he should be able to find water almost any where around his buildings, especially so if there are several springs running out of the hills and emptying in the creeks. Many people con - sider that they can take a well in such a neighborhood and tap one of the springs. This is very seldom the case, In fact the circumstances are generally the opposite. The springs are nearly always draining the water out of the hill, hence, it is always best to investigate the sloughs and streams adjoining a place where the well is to be sunk, and if there are springs emptying in these sloughs do not waste much money digging wells but go down to the springs, develop them, then pipe the water to the buildings. There are four general methods of obtaining water supply as used In the state. The gravity system, buckets and windlasses, pumps, and In a few cases rams. Of course there are other methods than those which are given under these classes but these are the ones most generally used. The simplest and most durable method is that of gravity and whenever possible this system should lie utilized. In a great many cases a spring along a side hill can be developed and the water conducted to all parts of the buildings and yards at a very little expense. The essential point to consider in such a system is to have the overflow discharge in a place where the mud will not be a serious trouble. It is generally best to have the pipe from the spring connected first with the house, then run from there to the milk-house or barn and then through the other buildings. If the buildings can be arranged so that one string of pipe will connect all it is a much simpler method and less expensive. Where the spring is not high enough above the house to furnish much force as it enters the kitchen it is best to have it flow into a good sized barrel then from the barrel to the barns. By such a scheme there is no time wasted on wash days and other days for water to run sufficient to fill the tubs or boilers. Often shallow wells can be dug along the sides of the hills and then the water siphoned from the well to the house. In a case of this kind lead </seg>
            <seg id="p356">356 pipe should always he used and no size less than one-half Inch. One - half Inch pipe flowing a full size stream continually will supply all the stock on an average section of land. There are a great many instances where a bored or driven well will not supply sufficient water, whereupon If the well had been dug and walled a sufficient reservoir could be produced to accumulate a large v of water. Of course there are arguments both for and against a dug well. As a rule they are more expensive and as they are generally cared for they are not as sanitary as a driven or bored well. All dug wells, in fact all wells should he raiser! several feet above the surround - ing land and then walled up vermin tight. Tt is also best for a dug well to be kept tightly covered then it will be free from birds, cats, rats, etc. The water as removed from dug wells can be either pumped or taken out with a hucke*. If the well is close to the house and if used for both house and barn both schemes cin be very economically utilized. There Is nothing that pleases a strong, healthy man in the heat of the day better than a cool drink of water and there Is no better means of getting It than by the bucket and windlass. However, this scheme is very slow where laree quantities are wanted, consequently a pump should be put in at the sir&lt;e of the well. Another convenience to be derived from a dug well Is that a dumb - waiter can le inserted in it so that all those articles of food which are generally Vent in the refrlgerntor can 1-e put in the dumb-waiter and much food he saved and the house-wife le saved a great deal of annoyance There are so many different types of pumps that it would be useless to give a complete detail classification of them here. It will be well however to clsssifv them as suction pumps, deep well pumps, rotary pumps, and tank pumps. Suction pumps can be used in wells which are not over twentv-flve feet to w»*er. Wells having a deeper depth should have force pumps. Rotary pumps are peTerally more efficiently used for larre nuantities of water with oily a smell lift. Tank pumps are simply a modification of the suction pumps, irenerallv of the double stroke type and with onlv a small lift, in f»ct there are so many different classes of pumps that it is hard to make a selection. The following as taken from an article entitled "The Old Oaken Bucket and its Up-to-date Brother." by E H. H.. in the Canadian Thresherman. gives some very good points on common pumps. "The number of kinds is so great that the average purchaser, when in need of a new pump, buys the same he has been using, or the same his neighbor has. or what his dealer handles, without attempting to go into the matter in detail. In fact from my own experience. I am Inclined to think that to the average buyer a pump is a pump very much as to the ordinarv citv person a cow is a cow. or a horse Is a horse. He does not know anything about breeds or pedigrees, or that one breed Is best for milk, another best for butter, and another best for beef. But eren though a person may understand these general differences, It is only the </seg>
            <seg id="p357">357 expert in stock raising who is able to discover those fine points in an animal which make it the l&gt; r st of its particular breed. The varieties of pumps are greater than the varieties of cattle, and the determining of the finer points of excellence Is about as difficult in one case as in the other Our progressive agricultural colleges have recently come to ap- late this fact and have established courses in farm mechanics In which the study of pumps i* included. Different styles of pumps are obtained from the various leading manufacturers and the merits of each style are demonstrated to the students "But while there are hundreds of manufacturers making thousands of different pumps, there are a few fundamental principles which form the - of all successful pump making, and which can be easily understood by the average person. It is the pirnofe of this article to so explain the :eneral characteristics of pumps, and the conditions under which each general type should be used, that the average purchaser will be able to distinguish the differences and buy intelligently "The thing which the manufacturer considers in designing any partic- ular style of pump is the conditions under which it Is to be used. The thing for a buyer of a pump to find out is what make of pump has been most skilfully designed and most carefully built to meet the particular conditions under which his pump is to be used. The conditions in your case may be very ordinary or very unusual, but you may feel very certain that someone, somewhere, is making a pump to best meet those condi - tions. If you buy that pump you will pump your water most easily, and with the least annoyance and expense. If you buy a pump which was designed for entirely different conditions, you will fail to secure the baat results. Almost any pi:mp will raise water, it is true, but no pump is suitable for all the different conditions under which pumps are used. As a homely illustration of the above, let us say that it is quite 1 lc to ride to town several miles in .1 farm wagon which has no springs, bat if you are coins; for the pleasure of the ride it is much more comfortable to go in a top-buggy. But let us go a step farther and add that the Imgpy which is very satisfactory for driving on country roads will not be found suitable for continuous driving on granite pavements. Whether you arc b n»W °r a pump, or any other article, the conditions under which it is to I -hould first have careful con- i ation. and then the urti lUed to those circumstnnces will nd most satisfactory The most important conditions to be taken into account are the depth of the well to low water mark, the elevation above the top of the well to which the water is to be forced, the distance from the well to which the water is carried, the quantity of water required per day and the power or means to lie used to operate the pump. With these points in mind, it should also be understood that every ordinary pump is made up of three separate and distinct parts, viz.: the pump standard. of the pump, which rests on the platform of the well; or main </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 Iylinder, or working barrel, which contains the valves; and the ctian between the standard and the cylinder, consisting of pipe od. When the conditions mentioned above have been determined, each separate part of the pump should be selected to suit those tions. The best way to go about this can be made most clear number of imaginary cases. "If the well is a shallow, dug well, let us say fifty feet deep, the water to be all discharged at the spout of the pump, the quantity of water required small and the pump to be operated by hand, a good selection would be: a medium weight cast-iron standard, fitted with plain spout and a top for hand use. a brass-lined iron cylinder 214 inches or 2\ inches in diameter and 12 inches long, enough 1&gt;4 -inch galvanized pipe and 7-lfi inch galvanized pump rod to place the cylinder far enough down in the well so that it will always be under water, and a gauze strainer for the lower end of the cylinder. If the articles mentioned are all of the best make and are properly put in place, the result will be a pump which will operate easily, will not need priming, and will not be likely to pet out of order. The first cost of such a pump might be reduced a little by using a plain iron cylinder — that is. one without the brass lining — and black pipe in place of the galvanized, but this would prove poor economy in the end. "If the well in the case just outlined should be more than fifty feet deep, it would be advisable to ufe a heavier pump standard, and the diameter of the cylinder should l&gt;e reduced in proportion to the depth of the well. For a well from 50 to 75 feet deep the diameter of the cylinder should be IVi inches, or 2H inches, and from 75 feet to 100 feet, 2% or 2 inches In diameter. For wells more than 100 feet deep, special cylinders are required, which will be described later. ■' in any of the foregoing cases the pump is to be operated b&gt; a nill, the standard selected should be fitted with what is known windmill top. '"The foregoing illustrations refer to what are commonly called "lift pumps" — that is. pumps designed to raise the water to the spout of the pump only. These are the simplest and cheapest pumps, and. If of a good make, are in every way satisfactory for the work for which they are intended. Where water is to be raised above the pump spout, it is necessary to use a force pump. These are a little more complicated than *he lift pumps and are made in a greater variety of styles. In buying such a pump the inexperienced purchaser is likely to become confused by the many different devices and attach - ments and make a wrong selection, but it is here that it is most important to be right Khe problem of buying a force pump will be very much simplified is borne in mind that nearly all of the countless styles and les of force pumps can be grouped in two general classes, yIz.: having plain standards and those having three-way standards. The standards are similar in general design and appearance to the </seg>
            <seg id="p359">359 B pumps already referred to, but they have a round polished piston working through a stuffing box in the top of the standard pre - ing the escape of water at that point. In the three-way standards stuffing box is placed four or five feet below the platform of the well. The main part of these standards is usually made of wrought iron pipe, for reasons whijh will be explained presently. "The plain force standards are made in two general styles, the one with plain spouts and the other with cock spouts. The former are for use where the water is to be discharged at the spout, the sub* as wilh the lift pump; and where it is desired to sometimes attach a hose to the spout for washing wagons, sprinkling the yard, or for similar purposes. The standards with the cock spout should be uaed where the water is to be forced into an elevated tank directly above or near at hand. By means of the cork in the spout the water can be drawn from the spout or turned into The tank above as desired. The cock spouts are made in a variety of styles, such as lever handle cock spouts, three-way cock spouts, and bib-cock spouts. The latter are most desirable and least likely to get out of order. "The three-way standards are for use where the water is to be forced some distance through underground pipes. The stuffing box, three-way valve, and the underground outlet are al! assembled in one casting or water chamber at the lower end of the standard below the platform. In most pumps of this style, two pipes extend up from the water chamber below the platform of the well and form the body of the pump. One of these pipes is directly over the three-way valve, and has a spout on the upper end for discharging water at that point. The other pipe is closed at the upper end and acts as an air chamber when water is being delivered through the underground pipes. This is very important where the elevation or horizontal distance to the tank is considerable. Ibese are called three-way pumps because by moving the valve, which rated by a small handwheel, water may be discharged through the through the underground pipe, or, when the pump is not working, the elevated tank back through the spout. By a proper arrangement inch lines, check valve.s, float valves, etc., these pumps can be used charge water into any desired number of tanks. "Some styles of three-way pumps have an extra cylinder attached, which is connected with a lever for throwing the windmill out of sail when the tank is filled with water. This attachment complicates the pump somewhat, and where it is not especially needed the simpler styles of pumps will generally prove more satisfactory. In this connection it may be well to add that it is generally a good rule to buy pumps of simple construction, the working of which can be easily understood Pumps which have intricate or delicate parts are likely to cause endless annoyance. Eiree-way pumps are also made With either hand or windmill top, i most of them are used for rather heavy work they are usually ed by a windmill. They are built in various weights suitable for </seg>

The same cylinders are used with them ih the plain .standards; but in determining the size or diameter ■ cylinder the elevation above the pump as well as the distance water in the well must be considered. If the horizontal distance I li great, the diameter of the cylinder should be reduced M of the friction of the water in the discharge pipe. "This may be a good place to i which is one of the most had his paiici sly tried I who insisted on using small pipe i" ra;e ih&lt;- pump.

For an t have a three inch cylinder in a inch pipe from the cylinder to the will work perceptibly easier than if one and one-half inch, much easier than if one and r inch. and if the pipe should lie reduced to one inch it • ■ry difficult to work the pump at all. It seems, at first thought, that the three inch pipe, which contains nine times a.s much water as the one inch, would throw a heavier load upon the pump. This fact must not be overlooked, however, that the quantity of water discharged at the pump spout at each stroke of the pump is precisely the same whether the pipe is large or small. In the case of the three inch pipe, if the stroke or the plunger is nches the column of water is simply raised six inches at each •&gt;. In the case of the one inch pipe, which has one-ninth the capacity of the three inch, the column of water is raised nine by six r ffty-four inches. Now, if friction did not enter into the problem, there would be no difference, th"'&gt;-etically, between the labor required to raise the larger volume of water six inches, or the smaller volume fifty-four inches; but where a long column of water must be started Quickly at so great a speed, the friction becomes very serious. "It is true that the large pipe is expensive, but labor or machinery for operating a pump for ten or fifteen years is more expensive, and pocr economy to try to save on thf&gt; first cost of the pump by using small pipe. Where the water is not to be elevate'd more than one hundred ftet pipe which is about one-half the diameter of the cylinder will give the happy medium of moderate cost and easy operation. In no case, however, should the well pipe le smaller than one and one-quarter inches, because of the room occupied by the pump rod and its couplings.

The greatest objection to such in case of the pipes leading to the tank freezing There are two plans which if properly an outti during the w carried out will prevent these pipes freezing. One is to have the pipe housed with several dead air spaces and layers of insulation, and the other is to open the pipe at some point in the house or yards and let a smajl stream of water be continually running back through the pipes. It requires an extremely cold time and one which is very rarely known in this country to 1 e cold enough to freeze water running through It is -said by some that if the tank is set directly over the well and the pipe housed which leads from the well to the tank in such tnner that the air will pass from the well up through this housing through the pipe it has sufficient warmth to prevent the pipe's Ing.

As to what the limits rht nre in regard to this the writer is not ahle to state. A much more simple tank to install and one which is fully as sat - isfactory and prohably more so. is a tank in the attic of the ham or house. By having a tank in the barn or house there is very little danger of the pipes freezing, that is if the proper care is taken of them while constructing the outfit. Of course there is not nearly as much pressure with such an outfit, but there is sufficient except in case of fire. It is not well to depend on any suburban outfit In c»»e of fire because the flre always comes when the engine will not run. the wind is not blowing, and the tank is empty. Fifteen or twenty dollars invested in fire tubes or liquid chemical fire-extinguishers Is a much safer plan. The greatest benefit to be derived from elevated tanks of any de - scription is their ease of construction. The air pressure tank system is coming into very extensive use. Pv such a system a tank is placed in the cellnr out of the wav and oit of sight, and also there is no dine-er of freezing. Also a much higher pressure can be obtained by this system than by any other for rural use. A system which is operated by a hand pump or gasoline eneine en be installed bv anv practical farmer, but a system which is nm by automatic cut-out valves and a windmill should be installed bv an expert. Tn a svstem as snoken of last the windmill should not re 'ess than in feet and nerferably 12 feet. This will depend on the depth of the well and the maximum pressure to be obtained in the tank. Where such outfits are to be used for family use only, they can be in - stalled very cheaply by using an ordinary small water tank pump and use the water from a cistern. Generally a tank in the cellar thirty inches in diameter and eight feet in height is sufficient to supply the water of the family for a dav or two. Many people object to putting in such an outfit and pumping the water by hand because they say that it takes so lone tn pump water. It should not take more than five minutes a day to pump water sufficient for the ordinary family and regardless of the time it takes to pump it by this means it takes less time than to pump it when only a pail full is pumped at a time. A few energetic young men have taken two ordinary range boilers and made for them - selves an air pressure water system. The Nebraska farmer used to believe that he had his water handy if he did not have to carry it more than 150 feet to the house. The earliest settlers used to spend a great deal of time hauling water in barrels and tanks. Now the farmers are beginning to realize the amount of time lost in running back and forth between the well and the house consequently they are endeavoring to locate their wells near the house. This is of course a great saving of time over the old methods, however, they should not stop improving their places until they have the water running to all parts of the house. Hours in time and quantities of energy can be saved everywhere bv having a Rood water svstem on the farm </seg>

These are the protelds icle building foods; the fats or heat giving foods, and the carbo- J8 (starches and sugars), the heat and energy giving foods.

The balance is with a variable amount of fat and me. Even this refuse in the hands ly be made to yield its quota of Ishmenl. The French cook noted for making something from ently nothing, puts bits of bone, gristle, and tough fiber into his kettle, adds a few vegetables and herbs and serves from it a dish would tempt an epicure. structure. — The lean or edible portion of meat is made up of bundles of tubes held together by connective tissue and threaded by blood vessels and nerves. These tubes hold in solution, salts, extractives and a large part of the protein, while in the connective tissue between these tubes fat globules are found. These extractives, while of no direct food value, are of great Im - portance in giving flavor to the meat. The characteristic flavors of all meats are due to the browning either of these extractives or of the fata. These extractives are pronounced in beef and fowl but deficient in pork and mutton. To their fats is due then the characteristic flavor of the Care of Meats. — Too little attention is given by the average house - wife to the sanitary conditions which surround the meat she buys, the roast or steak is allowed to remain in the wrapping paper until used and the juices are absorbed by the paper and thrown away. Oftimes the meat is not washed, the argument being that part of the flavor is thereby lost; but the meat wagon going along the street, its contents half covered with a soiled cloth, handled by men with soiled hands and accessable to flies, makes this practice impossible. Moreover very little nourishment is dissolved out if the surface of the meat is carefully washed with a soft, damp cloth and then wiped dry. It is soaking in water that must be avoided. Keep meat in a cool place both before and after cooking. Bme butchered meats are as a rule subjected to more sanitary con- I and by taking proper care the farmer's wife is assured of clean </seg>

The western feeders do not as a rule feed grain and the grass steers are sent to market in a fair condition externally but the qual - if roasts and steaks is not to be compared with the corn fed animals. Ends to reason that much exercise and a limited amount of nour - ; food will give a tough meal. Any muscle that is much used be - i hard and tense while the one that is liule used is soft, the fibers ;r and more loosely bound together. This accounts for the differ - between a porterhouse and a round steak. The former lies where is little muscular action, the latter must come in play each time nimal moves. Good beef is firm, elastic, bright red, mottled with light yellow fat. meat is tender, but when exposed to the air for 24 hours ui more it quickly toughens, due to a drying of the tissue and the clotting of the protein in the muscle. Fresh meats are as a rule "ri - pened" as the butcher terms it, i. e., allowed to hang in cold storage for 5 or 0 weeks. During this time the Bbera are softend by the acids pro . by the barieria either on or in the meat. This ripening process gives an improvement both in texture and rtavi if ( oukmy. — The aim ot cool. ing meats i.s to develop the ■ and loosen and connective tissue so as to render it more digestible. particularly necessary therefore to avoid any process which will harden the meat fiber. Many people practice the theory of more fire, quicker results, but this cannot be followed with meats with the best results. Since meat is composed largely of albumen the following test will illustrate the principle of cooking. Drop a small amount of raw egg-white into a vessel of boiling water; boil for 8 minutes. The result will be a tough indigestible substance with no flavor of the egg. Try the experiment with hot water, just bate* boiling, and keep hot for 8 minutes; the egg-white will be tender, palatable and digestible. The at in the firsi experiment hardened the albumen and prevented heating, while in the second the heat was allowed to penetrate evenly through the whole mass at a temperature favorable to delicate coagulation. This is true of the cooking of meats. Two fundamental principles are to be observed in the cooking of meats, first, to retain all juices as in sieaks, roasts, etc. Second, to extract all juices as in soups. In achieving the first, the essential thing is the immediate sear- ing over of the outside of the meat by intense heat to prevent the escape of juices, an.l then reducing the heat to allow thorough cooking without over-heating. Steam dots more to soften tissue than boiling. In making soups or extracting the juices the opposite method is followed, viz., putting the meat or shinbone on in cold water and heating slowly until it simmers, not boils. Keep up this slow cooking for several hours and the stock will have in solution all of the goodness of the meat. A third method might be mentioned — a combination of these two principles as in </seg>
            <seg id="p365">365 the cooking of stews. The pieces are browned over then put on in hot water and slowly steamed done. In this connection the tireless cooker might be mentioned. The principle is this — to retain the heat already in the kettle, by packing with a non-conductor of heat as asbestos, hay, feathers, paper, cotton or excelsior. They save time and fuel as well as improve the flavor of foods cooked in them. Home made cookers have been found to be very satisfactory. Ither important thing in securing good flavor and a digeatibla s the cooking of fats. They must not be over-heated, that Is, above the blue vapor stage; for above that temperature they de - le and in the stomach form an irritant. Perhaps this is one of eatest causts of indigestion, due to the excessive use of fried especially fried meats. |&gt;e ideal process of cooking meats are broiling and roasting, but can be followed only with tender cuts of meats. Steaks broiled hot griddle vary little in appearance and flavor from those broiled ly over the coals. The griddle is heated until smoking hot, then d with a piece of suet to prevent sticking; the steak is put on and 1 iu a few minutes, allowing the other side to be seared over. It n turned often until cocked to the desired state, rare or well done ■nomical 1't.c uf Meat. — Economy means management, the art of letting nothing go to waste. Any cook should get good results with the best of cuts to work with, but the one who can use inferior pieces of meat and present a palatable, nourishing dish, is the artist. The cheaper cuts are inferior not because they lack in food value but because they are tough and therefore less in demand. The choice cuts have their place but from the standpoint of economy the rest of the carcass must be used, and the housewife who gives her family a porterhouse steak one day and a beef loaf of cheap meat the next, has saved the difference between a 45-cent steak and a 15-cent loaf, and has fed her family well. A round steak may be made much more tender by rubbing it on both sides with vinegar or lemon juice and olive oil and allowing it to stand 10 hours. After the acid has softened the fiber, any excess may be wiped off with a soft cloth, leaving no objectionable flavor.

It will be the purpose of this paper to point out a few of the factors which enter into the economic marketing of farm products, and also to suggest means by which the farmer may be able to improve his condition along this line. It Is altogether possible that a careful study of this one Item of farm management might change the yearly statement so that a net gain would appear Instead of a net loss or an even break. If the item of rise In value of land is left out of consideration there are many fanners who would find it difficult to boast of even reasonable gains. Bad marketing is not the only thing which causes this state of affairs, but it is often One of the things which must be taken Into consideration in thto connection in the purchasing of a farm is its location. Few people realize the importance of locating a farm on a good transcontinental rail - road. There is always much delay if th° railroad station is on a branch line, where only one or two trains a day arrive, and where transfers must be made at the junction point. In the case of perishable goods this is a very important item. The farmer who lives on a trunk line is within about as easv reach of his closest city, even though if be located a hundred or more miles distant, as is the farmer who lives 10 miles from such a city on a good highway. The matter of having more than one railroad Is also an Important item. One may not he able to secure better rates because of competing lines, but the advantages which will be secured in the way of better accommodations many dollars to a heavy producer. and quicker rervice are often worth In the location of a farm It is well to get on a main traveled road becarse the reads which the farmers travel the most will be the ones which are Vent in the best condition. The cost of hauling Is much lessened by being close to town and by being located on a road which has no. or verv few bills. Tr«&gt; farmer shoi'ld value a man and team at $3 per day pt the l«ast calculation, and he cannot count on making much more than three miles per hour with a h°ivv load, count'ns» the time of loading unloading. This would be at the rate of about twenty cents per ton per mile for one ton loads. If the road is in such condi - tion that the farmer can haul two tons then the cost will only be ten cents per ton, and nmnv roads in the country will permit of the hauling of two tons with a cood strnne draft team. T-et the farmer remember that the road is no better than its poorest point, for it will he impossible for him to take a load to town if he cannot get It over the poorest point In the road. ~"' &lt; *^ </seg>

If our farmers could realize the advantages which would accrue to themselves by the founding of neighborhood breeding associations, they would not be slow in attempting something of thla kind. Suppose the farmers of some county should all agree to go into the dairy business, and all raise a particular breed of dairy cattle — the Holstein. for example, what would result. In the first place, large creamery agents would be attracted to the county because they could get their wares in large quantities. Second, It is probable capital could be Interested and a creamery started in the community, either private or cooperative. Expense of transporting the raw material would thus be eliminated. Third. Buyers of Holstein dairy cattle from all parts of the country would come to buy up the surplus stock. Ire is often a discussion as to whether or not the commission man nefactor to the farmer or is a robber. There are probably soase ■st commission men the same as there are some dishonest farmers, must acknowledge that there are many honest commission men. )f the advantages of selling your products through a commission e as follows: Klf you are a regular customer of the firm and ship goods in suffl - quantities to make it worth his while, he will keep you posted aa I market and will do his best to land you at a good time because isinpss will depend upon your prosperity. Kit is usually better to let him buy for you as well as sell, for he the market at all times and might be able to land something on 't spot." 3. Remember that all commission houses of any consequence have their "spotters." that is to say, that every shipment which yon make to their market, either to them or to another linn, is known in the ofiee of that firm upon the date of its arrival. They will class you either as a "regular," one who is constant in his shipments to certain houses, or as an "irregular." one who does not send to one house for more than one or two shipments. If you are a regular, you are ranked much higher in the appreciation of commission men than if you are an irregular, and it will be their first duty to take care of all their regulars before they attempt to get the very best for the irregulars. This is only natural and Is a perfectly sane business proposition. There are probably many instances where a commission man is not a necessity; and where his services add only an item of useless expense. It should be the aim of society to eliminate from its ranks all parasites, and make all men producers except a certain portion who must neces - sarily be distributors. Society only needs a certain number of these, and when that number has been exceeded harm is being done. No doubt we have thousands of men who are being supported by society who could well be producers under a proper organization. How to get that proper organization is a question not yet solved. </seg>
            <seg id="p370">370 Ke question often arises in the farmer's mind as to whether he shall t his products at retail or at wholesale. The advantages of the method to the producer are usually that he will receive a higher and that he will be able to market his products close to home. isad vantages of the retail are: ■ That he is at a greater expense. This greater expense comes In tra pains he has to make in the boxing and packing, the extra men ams it takes to deliver to the retail trade. K. In the poor price he will receive for any surplus which he may over and above what the retail demands. As a rule It is not pos - for the retailer to get from his merchant as large a price for hi8 is as it would be if he were not in competition with him for the business. K, The loss that will come from dissatisfied customers and bad which he must necessarily have. There will always be some of no matter how good his product is tior how careful he is in the Ion of his customers. K. In the extra expense he will be to in advertising his business. bus advertising is a very important thing now days in the retail business, and it is an item whi"h must not be overlooked, but y one which pays good dividends. It is necessary for the business farmer to keep accurate accounts of the cost of production and the cost of marketing. If he does this he will be able to tell in a few years, by referring to his records, which system of marketing is givine him the best results. If he is not making ends meet on his farm, it will be much easier for him to locate the trouble. I realize ns much as anybody else, having been there myself, how difficult it is for the farmer to find time to keep a good and com - plete SPt of hooks. The ordinary farmer is busy from half past 4 in the morning to 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening during the summer and from 5 o'clock in the morning until 7 or S in the evening during the winter, and he is at hard physical work for most of the time. The fanner who takes the time after this long day's work to jot down the transactions of the day is the exception, but when you find him you usually find one who knovs exactlv where he is in his business. He can usually tell you whether he is making his money on his corn, on his hogs, or on his grass land, and unless he is able to do this he certainly cannot expect to reach the highest success in the marketing of his products. It may be that some of his products are a losing proposition, no matter how much pains he takes in the marketing. Issldes. if he is keeping accounts he will be much better situated to i the market. I had occasion some time ago to prepare a table the high and low prices received for corn, wheat, oats, cattle and for a neriod of forty-two yeirs. these being compiled by th« 1. I found that during forty-two years the highest prices were for corn more often during the month of May than during any month in the year, and that the lowest price was paid during the </seg>
            <seg id="p371">371 months of December, January and February; that the average range for this period between the highest and the lowest was 28c per bushel. The reason, of course, why corn is the lowesl during the months men - tioned is because most farmers have time to haul their corn away at this season of the year, many farmers have not gone to the trouble to build cribs and bins in which to store their corn, and so the market is flooded. During the forty-two years mentioned but three lows struck during the months of April, May, June, July, August and September. In the case of wheat the highest price hit the months of April and May the oftenest, while the lowest price struck the month of August, with a range between highest and lowest of fifiy-one cents per bushel. Of course, August is the month when the grain is being threshed, as a rule, and many farmers from lack of bins haul the grain to market at this time of the year. With oats the highest prices are in the months of May and June, while the lowest are during August, with an average range of twenty cents per bushel. The same reason applies here that applied with wheat. In the case of cattle, the highest prices have struck the oftenest in the months 01 March, April and May, and the lowest during November, December and January, the average dif - ferences being $1 per hundredweight. With hogs the highest prices are paid during July, August and September, and the lowest during mber and January, with an average range of $1.50 per hundred - weight. Now the farmer in figuring whether oi not he can afford to hold his grain until the season of the year when he will most likely receive the highest price, must take into consideration the following items: The cost of the construction of bins and the interest on money invested in same; the value of his time during the season when the highest price occurs; the shrinkage of the grain, which will always occur in carrying it from one season to another; the loss from weevil, leakage, mice and other things which in some localities is doubtless heavy. In reference to the cattle, he must take into consideration the price of corn at the two seasons of the year, the availability of labor, the price of hay and the price which he would have to pay for his feeders. With hogs, he must remember that the months of July, August and September are hot months and that there will probably be a greater loss when he markets at this season. Let him also remember that the most profitable weight in which to market a hog is from 200 to 300 pounds, and that this weight should be attained at the age of from eight months to twelve months. This makes it necessary for him, if he is going to hit the highest point in the August market, to raise fail pigs, and in the raising of these fall pigs he must count the necessary cost of a good house, the extra care it takes to carry them through the winter months and the greater loss there is with pigs of this class, but he must also remember that the pigs are small during the winter and do not take a great deal of feed and that by the time his spring pas - tures are ready, his pigs are at an age when they will gain the Mat rapidly on pasture with a literal allowance of corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 These are only some of the points which the farmer should con - sider when he is studying the market problem. There are many others which must necessarily enter in, some with all farmers and some with certain farmers because of their peculiar locations. I cannot urge upon you too strongly the importance of giving this particular phase of farm management Us due consideration. </seg>

Professor of Agricultural Botany and State Botanist, Collaborator in Charge, and MISS XI.-I.I.IE blL\L.Nsu&gt;' rratory Aid, Seed Laboratory, United States Department of Agriculture. INTRODUCTION The investigations of the United States Department of Agriculture and several of the state experiment stations have served to arouse great interest among farmers in the purity and viability of agricultural seeds. Seed laboratories had long been in operation in Germany before any were established here and as a natural result much of the seed that was unmarketable under the German regulations was exported to the United Stales. At the present time there is imported a large amount of very poor and cheap seed to be used in the adulteration of the better grades of home-grown alfalfa, clover, and grass seeds. Our farmers have just begun to realize the importance of knowing the character and extent of the impurities found in the seeds they plant and the percentage of these seeds that will germinate. This widespread interest in good seeds in the West led the United States Department of Agriculture to establish in January, 1908, in cooperation with the Nebraska Experiment Station, the Nebraska Seed Laboratory at Lincoln. This laboratory is designed to make examinations of Mads for farmers and seedsmen in Nebraska and adjacent states. The fol - lowing persons have been connected with this laboratory during the periods indicated: F. D. Ueald, Professor of Agricultural Botany and State Botanist; Collaborator in Charge. (Resigned September 1, 1908.) E. Mead Wilcox, Professor of Agricultural Botany and State Botanist; Collaborator in Charge. (.From September 1, 1908.) Mrs. Herbert H. Mowry (nee Miss M. L. Crosby), Scientific Assistant. (Resigned July, 1908.) ■ Nelle Stevenson, Laboratory Aid. (From February 6, 1908.) Norma Waddle, Laboratory Aid. (Prom October 1, 1908.) The purpose of the present report is to present in a somewhat popular way some of the most interesting results secured by the labortory from the time of its establishment to April 30, 1909. •Reprinted from Bulletin 110 of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment </seg>

These spines are fragile and are seldom found intact imercial samples. Each spine is tipped with a barb which is of help in distribution. Alternating with the rows of spines are narrow ridges bearing bristles. The seed-bearing portion is a dull color, while the spines are lighter, almost yellow. The plant is a biennial and is considered a noxious weed and in some parts of the United States a veritable pest. Wild Cabbot (Daucut carota L.). </seg>
