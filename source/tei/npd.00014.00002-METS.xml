As a working basis for the study of the ornithology of the state it has : i invaluable and it has also been greatly in demand by people not ogists, who desired to ' 'know something about our birds." That edition was exhausted some time ago and its author has been frequently urged to publish er. However, the organization of the Nebraska Ornithologists' Union and the development of ornithology in the I has led to such a rapid increase in our knowledge in the past five years that it seemed that any ; ration would soon become out of date, and so no one ventured to undertake I is under these conditions that the opportunity has been offered, thr indness of Ex-Governor Fun •&lt;■ Board of Agi and an enthusiastic member of th lething oi of the state. It seemed too good an opportunity to be lost, an r the circumstances, the authors of this contribution feel that it can be considered, as its title states, as a preliminary review. It should be understood, nevertheless, preliminary in one sense as it is, that it has been prepared with the greatest care, and is believed to represent exactly the state of our knowledge at the present day. Every species has been care - fully considered, the specimens available exainin. ing states studied, the records in Bruner's list thoroughly canvassed, as well as all data which have accumulated since, and the whole n statements as ii early the limits of our knowledge in rega form under consideration. All specimens about which there could b&lt; doubt were sent to authorities east for exact determination. Those species have been previously reported from Nebraska but the right of which to » n our fauna is questioned or denied have been introduced, but in brack - ets. There have also been added under the phrase "extralimital" those species which may possr ind in the state in the future. This introduc forms and their inclusion i; pees has been thought desirable for the reason that many of them are almost sure to be found sooner or later, and this calling attention to them may result in their earlier detection and addition to our list. The aim has been to prepare a work which should not only reflect the present sta - knowledge, but at the same time be a new basis for future ■» r the same reason all species which are known &gt;- are marked with an asterisk. It will be ev he reader that the addition of the figures showing the details of bird structure and the article on Birds in relation to Agriculture and Horticulture, as well as of the synopses themselves, is in order that the paper may be useful to any on*, whether an ornithologist or not, and may be the means of further increasing </seg>

            <seg id="p005">5 BIRDS IN RELATION TO AGRICULTURE AND HORTI- TURE* BY LAWRENCE BRUNKK raska is a good home for birds. We know definitely as many at : tundred different kinds that have been found within our borders and te presence of 1 1 more is quite probable. Of these two hundred are definitely mown to nest in the state; many more certainly should be added to the list, uring winter months more than one hundred (120) have been recorded, hile the others leave in the fall for the warmer south country, only to re i us with the advent of pleasant weather in the following spring. V lere is much to be learned concerning the migrations, nesting, moulting, ongs and peculiar ways of living among the different birds that we may see our groves, fields, along the streams, on the prairies, and about the hedge ows and garden patches, the most important feature connected with th&gt; ives to us is their food habits. For it is by what they eat that birds can and o make themselves of so much value to us. Of course birds are of different olors, sizes, and forms, and have t heir beaks, feet, wings, and tails made so as o best conform to the uses for which they are intended. The woodpeckers lave hard, chisel-like beaks for cutting holes in the bark and wood, and, at le same time, their tail feathers are stiff and pointed so as to be of us* as &gt;rops for holding the birds in place while busily engaged at nest making igging for borers. In a like manner their long tongues are barbed snsf &gt;ear and drag forth the "worms" when reached. The short, strong beaks r the sparrows and their relatives are likewise suited f &lt; the many inrls of weed seeds eaten by these birds in winter, as well as for crushing ich insects as are eaten !• •' sum - ler time. On account of this most important feature in connection with our birds, we will confine our remarks in this paper chiefly to what they eat, and leave the descriptions of the birds themselves, their haunts, migrations, and nest building for some other time. Then too, almost everybody knows a few of these last mentioned things about most of our common birds. Minis can be useful to us in many ways. They can carry the seeds of ferent plants from one place to another so as to help start new groves in which we and our domestic animals may find shelter from the cold winds of winter and the oppressive heat in summer. They plant seeds of shrubs by the ws&gt;y- *The present chapter is a combination of two former papers by the aut on the same topic, but the subject matter has been somewhat modified and abridged. The first of these papers appeared in the Proceedings of the Ne - braska Ornithologists' Union, II, pp. 18-20, and the second in the New Elementary Agriculture, pp. 103-117. This last work was issued by the University Publishing Company of Lincoln, Nebr. \ </seg>

That such really is the case, can easily be seen a perusal of the following short account of the food habits of some of the birds: and loons feed chiefly on snails and other water animals such as are out ponds, lakes, and rivers. They also destroy grasshoppers and destructive insects when these latter are found about their haunts, e gulls, with their long wings and great powers of flight, often reach far their journeys.

Iie Prairie Chicken and Sharp-tailed Grouse, as well as the Quail or " Bob - e," all feed almost entirely on insects during the summer. They also eat ; numbers of these creatures during the remainder of the can get them. The Quail es; insect destroyers, since it eats both the Colorado poi ch-bug. Perhaps no other bird on the farm pays higher pric&lt; ! grain it gets than does the Quail. Living about hedge-rows, gr&lt; in ravines, where insects gather and lurk during the greater part of the , this bird discovers and devours large numbers of these enemies d only during the summer months when these vermin are moving a) all winter, too, it scratches among the fallen leaves, and other rubbish ing for hibernating insects of various kinds. Being a timid bird it seldom es cover to feed openly in the fields, and therefore does little real har - way of destroying grain*. Even the barnyard fowls do much in the way of destroying many die kinds of insects throughout. the summer months. Where fields of grain can be gone over systematically by chickens, turkeys, guinea kens, and d little or no damage is done by grasshoppers, cut-worms, and other si: pests, unless, of course, these insects are too numerous to be eaten by them. Erdinarily doves and pigeons are not considered harmful, yet they en insects. But, on the other hand, many weed seeds, as sunflower, ragweed, ail, etc., are eaten by them. Perhaps, all told, the good done by thr during the year will greatly overbalance the harm caused by their visits to . the grain fields and feed lots. During recent years, since we began studying more carefully just what various kinds of birds have been eating, it has been learned that many of those which we heretofore called rascals should really be considered as frit- Hawks and owls, all of which were killed on sight by nearly every ma boy who could shoot, are now spared, except when caught in the very act of stealing chickens.

The first two are night fliers, while the other is one of our birds that flies and feeds during daytime. The family to which the King-bird or Bee-bird belongs is a made up of insect eaters. They catch such kinds as flies, butterflies, r beetles, and grasshoppers. The few bees eaten by the Bee-bird should not I against the other members of the family, nor should we blame even the bee-killer himself too much for the occasional rascal of his kind that prefers -it near a hive and catch drones and, rarely, a worker. ws and their relatives, the magpies and jays, are sometimes called rascals. Perhaps there is good reason in a number of cases for giving these - so bad a name; but we must not judge them too hastily, for sotn Bare good deeds done even by the greatest of rascals. After finding out these deeds are, good and bad, we may think that enough good h:i - to at least give the "rascal" another chance. All of these birds eat Be insects, bu\k for bulk, than they do of any other substance. The Blue does much of the mischief for which we blame the Robin, orioles, and shes, and then sneaks away like a thief. He also robs the nests of our ■mailer and weaker birds at times. To partly offset these mean traits he destroys large numbers of injurious insects. The meadowlarks, orioles, and blackbirds are the most important 1 1 such insect pests as attack field crops.

The English, or European House-sparrow, has the worst reputation of the entire family. But this bird has some good traits which tend to secure for it our friendship.

They are true to their name, and butcher large mbers of insects, mice, lizards, small snakes, and even occasionally a few the smaller birds. They take their prey to some thorn bush or barbwire ice and impale the victims for future use or to dry up and blow away. The :&gt;d they do will more than outweigh the harm which they inflict. The vireos or greenli ••&gt;' are commonly called, which frequent thickets and hedgerows, live almost entirely upon an insect diet. Their food is composed chiefly of little caterpillars and grubs picked from the leaves of small trees and shrubs which form the shelter in which they make their home*.

Few places in which insects exist are neg- : some species which pass their entire lives in the water are preyed tnearl :ise where the food habits of our birds have been care - studied, do we find that the good done far exceeds the possible harm might be inflicted by our birds. Allowing twenty-five insects per day average diet for each individual bird, and estimating that we have . one and one-half birds to the acre, or in round numbers 75,000,000 ibraska, there would be required 1,875,000,000 insects for each n«. Again estimating the number of insects required to fill a bushel at 120,000, would take 15,625 bushels of insects to feed our birds for a single da- 3,750 bushels for 150 days. These estimates are very low when we take account the numbers of insects that various kinds of our birds have i known to destroy in a single day. For example, the stomach of four contained 1,028 eggs of canker worms. Four others contained eggs and 105 mature females of this same insect. The stomach * Frank M. Chapman in Bird Life — D.

Birds, like all other animals, feed upon that food which is most re obtained, hence the insectivorous kinds destroy those insects which ar most numerous — the injurious species; and likewise the seed-eaters subaiat largely upon the seeds of our weeds. </seg>
