            <seg id="p002">2 REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL STATE OF NEBRASKA ADJUTANT GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT LINCOLN January 1, 1929. From: The Adjutant General of Nebraska. To: His Excellency, Arthur J. Weaver, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska, Subject: Biennial Report of 1927 and 1928. 1. In compliance with the requirements of Section No. 3305, Chapter 34, article 1, revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, the follow - ing Biennial Report for the calendar years 1927 and 1928 is respect - fully submitted. 2. During the past two years, the National Guard of Nebraska has reached a high standard of efficiency and in its development has made most gratifying progress. Each year, training has materially improved and in a logical and progressive manner. The community interest in our units and the moral assistance of committees of Chambers of Commerce in the cities where the units are located, as well as many where no troops are stationed, has been most helpful. 3. The character of supply and equipment is not altogether satis - factory as we are still using war time stock and the uniforms, in my opinion, should be classed as shoddy; however, the Federal Gov - ernment has promised us new uniforms for our enlisted men in 1930 and I am sure these will prove most beneficial. The ordnance is of the best and since the Federal Government has allowed us caretakers in the form of motor mechanics, all trucks have been placed in the best condition possible, and notwithstanding the fact that they were issued from the World War supply, are considered serviceable in case of an emergency. 4. By virtue of the National Defense Act and Miltia Bureau regulations, the Adjutant General of Nebraska, under the direction of the Governor, is required to execute the approved policies of the War Department as well as the laws of Nebraska in so far as applic - able to the National Guard. In addition to this, records of veterans </seg>
            <seg id="p003">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 3 of the Civil War, Spanish American War and World War are kept in this office and we are daily called upon for certified copies of these records. A complete record of all Federal property issued to the National Guard, as well as all funds allotted to the State, is also kept in this office. The amount of property accounted for, and now in the State, is over a million dollars in value and the aanoscf'~disburse - ment from Federal funds is something over five hundred thousand dollars; this in addition to the training programs required, supervision of training of the National Guard units during their armory drills and being in charge of the annual field training, gives some idea of the work performed by this office, and is handled by total personnel of six, which is much less than most States with a like number of units employ. CAMP ASHLAND Additional improvement has been made at this camp site by the Federal Government including a permanent kitchen and mess hall for each company, two kitchens and mess halls for officers, an admin - istration building, and contracts have now been let for supply houses. OTHER FUXDS Since the passage of the act by the last session of the legislature, making it possible for the Governor of the State to receive from the Federal Government monies taken from the Nebraska units during the World War which were known as "other funds", the Government has returned to the reconstituted units of Nebraska approximately |30,000. Every unit in Nebraska voted to return these funds to the Adjutant General of Nebraska, as trustee, to be used in the con - struction of a memorial building at Ashland, which will be used as a welfare building and recreation hall; this building will be in memory of the veterans of the World War who created the fund, thereby mak - ing it possible to have it returned to the present organizations. IXSPKCTIOXS Annual armory inspections are made by Officers of the United States Army detailed for that purpose. The results of our last armory inspections evidenced close conformity to schedules and gave the Ne - braska National Guard a very satisfactory rating. ARMORIES As reported before, the most discouraging proposition with which the units of the Nebraska National Guard have to contend is the rental of armories. It is almost impossible to rent suitable buildings </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL at reasonable rentals for armories for the National Guard units which .give adequate protection to Government property that the State is required to protect, and, at the same time, have ample space for armory drills and training. In this regard, Nebraska is behind many of the other States who have constructed armories and the State is frequently criticized by in - spectors on this account. It will be much cheaper in the long run for the State to construct its own armories and we expect to intro - duce a constructional program in the near future which we hope our legislature will give favorable consideration. UNITED STATES ARMY OFFICERS AND SERGEANT INSTRUCTORS DETAILED TO THE STATE The following is a list of United States Army Officers and Sergeant instructors who are detailed by the War Department to the State of Nebraska for instructional purposes and who render very valuable service and have done much to assist in placing the Nebraska National Guard at its present high standing among the other States ot the union. Lt. Col. Morris M. Keck, Inf. DOL., Lincoln, Nebr. Major Emil H. Burgher, MC. DOL., Lincoln, Nebr. Capt. McGregor Snodgrass, QMC. DOL., Lincoln, Nebr. Capt. Leo J. Farrell, Inf. DOL., Omaha, Nebr.

DEML., Lincoln, Nebr. ARMORY DRILL Armory drill attendance has shown a steady increase during the past year and has exceeded the expectations of both the State and Federal authorities. Assemblies are held each week on regular sched - ule for each unit. Programs are prepared by regimental and bat - talion commanders and schedules are submitted in advance covering the detail instruction given. Under the United States laws, each officer and enlisted man is allowed a day's pay by the Federal govern - ment for each drill attended. Attendance is mandatory and penalties are provided for non-performance. CONCLUSION In conclusion I wish to express my appreciation to the officers and enlisted men of the National Guard, and to the officers and non- </seg>

The following letter from the Chief, Militia Bureau is pub - lished for the information of all concerned and in publishing the letter, I wish to again call to the attention of all responsible officers, the </seg>
            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 26 absolute necessity of safe guarding all Federal and State property from loss, theft, or unnecessary wear. 2. While none of the irregularities spoken of in the third para - graph have been called to the attention of this office, it is well for all to understand that such things will not be countenanced and it is always just a question of time when those participating in these irregularities are brought to justice. 1. On page 48, Report of the Chief of Militia Bureau for the Fiscal Year ended June 30, 1926, attention was directed to the large number of Reports of Survey and Inventory and Inspection reports re - ceived and acted upon in the Militia Bureau, during the period covered by the report. It was stated therein that Reports of Survey, Inven - tory and Inspection Reports covering Federal property issued to the National Guard, which had been lost, destroyed, stolen, or rendered unserviceable by fair wear and tear in the service, had a total value of $3,823,367.70. Appendix N of the Report shows by States the principal items lost or stolen and dropped on Reports of Survey dur - ing the Fiscal Year 1926. Appendix O shows by States the value of the property dropped by Reports of Survey and Inventory and Inspection Reports during the Fiscal Year 1926, and the value of the Federal property in the hands of the National Guard. A careful study of the data contained in Appendices N and O above referred to, undoubtedly sustains the opinion frequently expressed in reports from various sources, that one of the weak points of the National Guard is the lack of care in handling public property. 2. The information outlined above was placed in the Report of the Chief, Militia Bureau, in the hopes that the situation would be brought to the attention of responsible officers of the National Guard in the various States, with a view to improving the situation in this important matter. I am happy to say that several States have already Office of the Chief of the Militia Bureau Washington n Reply refer January 26, 1927. ro MB 400.241 Neb. -1 Subject: Care of Public Property and Distribursement of Publt Funds. ro: The Adjutant General of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">REPORT OP THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 27 initiated action which will undoubtedly have the effect of correcting some of the deficiencies which have existed in the care and preserva - tion of public property in the hands of the National Guard and I hope that other States which have not taken this action will do so at the very earliest practicable date. 3. During the past year a comparatively large number of irregul - arities in the disbursement and expenditure of public funds have been brought to the attention of the Militia Bureau through investigations conducted by the Department of Justice and by the Inspector General's Department of the Army. These irregularities have involved the pay - ment for attentance at armory drill, the payment of caretakers and the sale of public property. In some cases the State authorities con - cerned have initiated suitable disciplinary action; in others, indict - ments have been obtained and cases have been prosecuted in the courts. In the recent debate in the House of Representatives on the War Department Appropriations Bill, with special reference to items pertaining to the National Guard, the charge was made on the floor of the House of Representatives that there was wholesale padding: of pay rolls and fraudulent payments to enlisted men as caretakers. While such accusations were properly answered at the time, the number of irregularities brought to light during the past fiscal year is undoubtedly responsible for the impression in certain quarters that there is laxity in handling of public funds in the National Guard. Of course I cannot condone such irregularities nor can I intervene to protect individuals. At the same time I am very much concerned lest these continued irregularities shall have the effect of bringing the good name of the National Guard into disrepute and cause a loss of the public confidence. In my opinion, these are matters of primary importance to all officers of the National Guard and particularly to those in positions of responsibility. 4. The primary purpose of this letter is to bring these matters to your attention and to suggest that you insist that all officers charged with responsibility for public property in the hands of the National Guard, for the preparation of pay rolls, for disbursement and ex - penditure of public funds, and for delivery of pay checks, must exer - cise the greatest care and do all in their power to prevent the loss of public property, irregular disbursements and expenditures.

Subject: Number of Armory Drills during fiscal year 1927 To: The Adjutant General of Nebraska. (Through the Commanding General, 7th Corps Area) 1. In Circular Letter, MB 240.91, dated February 9, 1927, you were advised that in addition to the 36 armory drills authorized for the first three quarters of the fiscal year 1927, authority was granted to hold such additional drills during the fourth quarter, fiscal year 1927, as will bring the total during the fiscal year 1927 to 48 drills, and that the maximum number of 48 drills, therein authorized for the fiscal year 1927 could not be exceeded in any case. 2. The instructions above referred to were not designed to place a limitation on the number of armory drills that might be held in the fiscal year 1927, but were designed to fix the number of drills for which Federal pay could be allowed under appropriations available. It is realized that if National Guard units were limited in armory training to the hours for which Federal pay is allowed there would be little hope of ever attaining a very high degree of efficiency. The National Guard has to give many hours of time to military work that is not covered in the periods for which Federal pay is allowed. It is believed that Federal pay for armory drill is merely a recogni - tion of units having had sufficient instruction to warrant an expendi - ture of Federal funds to compensate them in part for work done. 3. The last sentence of paragraph 2 of the above mentioned letter should not be construed as prohibiting the holding of drills or giving of instruction in time not covered by the authorized number of armory drills. On the contrary the holding of extra drills and formations for instruction whereever and whenever that can be done should be encouraged. CREED C. HAMMOND, Major General, Chief, Militia Bureau."

Work has been completed in this office whereby a list of all Reconstituted World War Units have been submitted to the Secretary of War, and as a result of this work, it is expected that checks for "Other Funds" of the Reconstituted Units will be sent direct to Com - pany Commanders. 2.

Circular Letter No. 13 Subject: Commissions in the Officers' Reserve Corps. To: All Unit and Sub-unit Commanders, Nebraska National Guard. 1. The National Defense Act and regulations issued thereunder provide that every Federally recognized National Guard officer may receive an appointment in the O. R. C. and a commission in the Army of the United States in the same grade and branch, this commission to be concurrent with Federal recognition of the National Guard officer. 2. For this reason the five year commissions formerly held in the O. R. C. are being cancelled and officers of the Nebraska National Guard are being offered commissions as outlined in paragraph 1 above. 3. The question has been raised as to loss of rank when an officer accepts a commission under the new plan, but this question is raised only because of the fact that the matter is not clearly under- Stood. 4. The date of an O. R. C. commission has no bearing whatever upon the rank within the grade. Section 5 of War Department </seg>

When dates of rank are the same, precedence shall be determined by length of active commissioned service in the Army. When length of such service is the same, officers of the Regular Army shall take rank among themselves according to their places on the promotion list, preceding reserve and National Guard officers of the same date of rank and length of service, who shall take rank among themselves according to age. 5. This Department desires that all officers of the Nebraska National Guard accept appointment in the O. R.

            <seg id="p038">38 REPORT OP THE ADJUTANT GENERAL pay all enlisted men one dollar per day out of State funds for each day in actual attendance at our annual encampment, this in addition to Federal pay. 2. This increase in pay should enable each unit commander to get the most desirable recruits as it virtually eliminates the pay sacrifice that many of the young men have been compelled to under - go in attending camps at a time of year when their earning capacity should be at its peak, but it is desired that unit commanders, in sel - ecting their recruits now look to quality more than quantity as this increase should make it possible for every unit commander to have a waiting list. 3. Along this line, your attention is called to the necessity of holding your strength down to a reasonable number, and in no event should a unit commander bring more than sixty-five men to camp as an increase over this number will make it necessary to reduce the State pay accordingly for next year.

To: All Unit and Sub-unit Commanders, Nebraska National Guard. 1. Inviting attention to copy of letter received from The Chief, Militia Bureau, relative to Limitation of Armory Drills. WAR DEPARTMENT Militia Bureau Washington MB 240.91-Mo.-ll October 10, 1927. Subject: Limitation of Armory Drills. To: The Adjutant General of Nebraska, (Thru the Commanding General, Seventh Corps Area) 1. There has been some misunderstanding of the provisions of Militia Bureau letters MB 240.91 of May 28, 1926, February 9, 1927 and May 5, 1927, on Limitation of Armory Drills. 2. Because of the phrasing of the letters, it has been construed in some quarters that the Secretary of War through the Chief, Militia Bureau, was limiting the number of assemblies which might be held during a certain quarter or year. (See Par. 11, NGR. 45). The letters were not intended to convey such a meaning. While each organization is required to hold the minimum number of assemblies authorized from time to time by the Secretary of War, the State authorities may prescribe as many more assemblies for a unit as they desire. The Secretary of War in the letters above referred to prescribed the maxi - mum number of assemblies for which Federal pay is authorized within the limits of available appropriations, which number is also the mini - mum number of assemblies which must be held. The letters while un - fortunately using the phrase "the number of drills to be held", do not limit the number of assemblies which may be held by an organization. 3. However, no matter how many assemblies may have been held, in the preparation of pay-rolls only those assemblies for which Armory Drill pay is authorized should be entered on the pay-roll. If the </seg>
            <seg id="p061">REPORT OP THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 61 number of assemblies held during a quarter exceeds the number for which Federal Armory Drill pay has been authorized, only the par - ticular assemblies for which such pay is claimed may be entered upon the pay roll. 4. The responsibility for the selection of such assemblies rests with the various organization commanders and the individual mem - bers must abide by this selection, the presumption being that all mem - bers of any organization have been notified through advance publica - tion of training schedules as to which assemblies are to be used for computation of pay. (See Par. 18, NGR. 45). To illustrate, assume a company has held sixteen ordered assemblies in a quarter on dates as follows: January 2, 9, 16, 23, 31, February 6, 13, 20, 22, 28, March 4, 11, 18, 21, 26, 31. Assume further that at each assembly the strength requirements for Armory Drill pay purposes have been met; that 12 assemblies have been authorized for the quarter by the Militia Bureau, and that the organization commander has selected the 12 assemblies for entry on the pay-roll. Assuming further that he has selected the five held dur - ing January, those held on February 6, 13, 20 and 28, and those held on March 11, 18, and 26, only these assemblies may be considered as "authorized assemblies." The officers belonging to the organiza - tion may use only these assemblies for qualifying for Armory Drill pay and no enlisted man may be paid for any assembly he may have attended on any date other than the dates selected.

Subject: Examinations of Candidates for West Point. To: All Unit and Sub-unit Commanders, Nebraska National Guard. 1. The following letter from the Adjutant General of the Army, dated August 19, 1927, addressed to the Governor of Nebraska, is published for the information and guidance of all concerned. Ap - plications for this examination should reach this office not later than November 3, 1927, to enable us to prepare for the competitive ex - aminations which will be held November 9th to November 12th, 1927, inclusive. WASHINGTON AG 051.11 West Point (8/19/27) Off. August 19, 1927. The Governor of Nebraska Lincoln, Nebraska. My dear Governor: The regulations for the selection of enlisted men of the National Guard for appointment to the United States Military Academy provide that the candidates shall be apportioned among the States, Territories and the District of Columbia according to the enlisted strength of their respective National Guard organizations. Candidates from the States and Territories will be selected by the respective Governors thereof from successful competitors in a preliminary examination of a scope and nature similar to the regular examination for entrance to the Military Academy, to be instituted and conducted by the Gov - ernors, and to be held between November 1 and November 15 of each year. Under the statute authorizing these appointments, the Governors are restricted in their choice of candidates to enlisted men of the National Guard who conform to the requirements mentioned. To be eligible for appointment from the National Guard, an ap - plicant must be an enlisted man of a unit recognized by the Federal Government. He must, on the date of admission, July 2, 1926, have served as an enlisted man not less than one year, must be between the ages of nineteen and twenty-two years and must be not less than </seg>
            <seg id="p063">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 63 five feet four inches in height. The age and service requirements are statutory and cannot be waived or modified, but it is not essential that the service be continuous, so that former service in the Guard may be counted in determining an applicant's eligibility. Similarly, service with a National Guard organization prior to its recognition by the Federal Government, may be considered, the date of enlist - ment of the soldier governing, and not that of the recognition of the unit. The requirements for admission to the Military Academy are fully set forth in the inclosed pamphlet, a supply of which is being sent you under separate cover for distribution to those concerned. The candidates so selected will be authorized by the War Depart - ment to report for the regular entrance examination, which is sched - uled to be held beginning on March 6, 1928, and the appointments available on July 2, 1928, will be awarded to the qualified candidates in the order of merit established at that examination, which is com - petitive among all National Guard candidates. You are, therefore, requested to select, in accordance with the fore-going, one candidate from among the enlisted men of the National â€¢Guard of your State, and to designate him for the entrance examina - tion mentioned, using therefor the inclosed blank form. These cadet - ships being awarded as a result of competition, alternates cannot be considered. There is no limitation to the number who may compete in the preliminary examination and it is suggested that this matter be widely advertised throughout the National Guard organizations of your State so that every enlisted man who is eligible as to age and length of service may be afforded this great opportunity. In the past, some States have failed to take advantage of the opportunity to designate candidates, while other States have desig - nated their full quotas and are constantly asking for the privilege of making more appointments. As a result it has been decided to re - quire that designations shall be made promptly following the No - vember preliminary examination, and in no case later than December 15, 1927. When sending in your designations, it is requested that you inform the Department as to the number of other desirable can - didates, if any, you may have available. The allotments of those States which allow the opportunity to lapse through failure to fill their quotas by December 15, 1927, will be given to other States. Very respectfully, BY DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR: H. J. PAUL, The Adjutant General, Nebraska. LUTZ WAHL, 2 incls. Major General." </seg>

The above mentioned physical examination is required for every officer and warrant officer of the active National Guard and National Guard Reserve under the provisions of paragraph 4, National Guard Regulations No. 27. c. In compliance with the provisions of the National Guard Regulations indicated above, the physical examinations for the cal - endar year 1927 should be completed in December and reports sub - mitted. It will greatly facilitate the administrative work of the Militia Bureau and avoid unnecessary correspondence as to delinquent re - ports if a thorough and complete check is made for the purpose of determining that no omissions have been made in making the re - quired examinations and in rendering the reports of them.

It is desired that a decision be arrived at as to the distribution of the funds which were taken from the Nebraska units who served </seg>
            <seg id="p075">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 75 during the World War and which was recently turned back to the State of Nebraska. Your attention is invited to previous communica - tions, one of which was dated some time in May and one some time in October 1927, which gives information regarding this fund and about which we have held several meetings of the Commanding Officers of organizations with a desire to arrive at a conclusion as to a just and equitable method of distribution. 2. We must first take into consideration the fact that none of the present units have contributed a single dollar towards this fund and that it rightfully belongs to the men who served during the World War but it comes back to us as reconstituted units, on account of its being impossible to reach those to whom the fund more prop - erly belongs and along this line we should take into consideration the desires of those men, many of whom are dead and gone and of whom there is nothing but a memory left. 3. If this money is pro-rated and distributed among the pres - ent units, a share would of necessity be deducted for future organ - izations, which would leave the amount to us pro-rated and distributed so small that no one unit would derive much benefit; so the problem which now arises is how to dispose of this money so that it will be equitably made use of, so that those who created the fund will be satisfied and so it will insure the greatest benefit to the present mem - bers of the National Guard and those who are as rightfully entitled to same who join up in the future. 4. Since our organization, there have been numerous changes in units which greatly complicate a division of this fund. For instance, one unit will shortly be demobilized because of lack of support in that particular community; it was necessary to muster out three other units on account of lack of officer material to continue the organiza - tions and, after old units are mustered out, new units will be mustered in, so the question arises as to whether or not it would be fair to the persons who happened to be members at this particular time to ex - pend same and make no provision for those future members who will be as justly entitled to it. 5. After numerous conferences of the respective Commanding Officers with this office, we have concluded that a much more equit - able and just use of this money can be made through the building of a Memorial Recreation building on our camp grounds at Ashland. The fund is just about adequate to construct a very suitable building which could be used by the entire personnel of the camp each year. This building would have a large auditorium, dance hall, stage, read- </seg>
            <seg id="p076">76 REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL ing and lounge rooms, a large balcony overlooking the river together with rooms for a hostess and visitors to the camp; this would give the present personnel immediate benefit and would 'be a benefit for the entire National Guard for all time to come. We have had an architect draw up a rough outline of what this building is to be and in case we can get a copy of same in time it will be inclosed with this letter, otherwise, we will send it at the earliest possible date. 6. The building of a Memorial, in memory of the World War soldiers who created this fund for us, has the approval of Col. Amos Thomas, 134th Infantry, Col. David C. Hilton, 110th Medical Regi - ment, Maj. Marcus L. Poteet, 35th Division Train, and all junior field Officers who have met with us from time to time in our deliberations. 7. It is desired that the Commanding Officer of each unit and sub-unit present this matter to the personnel of his command at the first meeting after receipt of this letter and communicate the attitude of the command on this subject to this office. The matter should be fully explained to the men as to just what the fund is, its source, and the fact that a rather inequitable division and unsatisfactory arrangement, lacking permanency, would necessarily result if the fund is to be pro-rated to the several organizations. It also should be explained to them that the Recreational building would be a per - manent addition to the camp and would be a continuous benefit to them. While the Commanding Officers of the several organizations and this office feel that a Recreational building would be of much greater permanent value, it is felt that this matter should be taken up with the unit Commanders and their personnel and their attitude de - termined before any final decision is made. 8. There is inclosed herewith for your guidance and benefit a copy of form to fill in for the minutes of your next meeting and a certificate to fill out as to action taken on same and which should be sent to this office at the earliest possible date.

Company Commanders will make any members of their command who have a desire to take this examination conversant with the requirements of the inclosed pamphlet, and while some believe that a High School graduate can pass this examination, it has been demonstrated that unless they have had at least one year in college, in addition to their High School education, it will be time wasted. 5. Owing to a shortage of funds, it will be impossible for the State to pay any part of the expenses of applicants in coming in for this examination. 6. The return of this pamphlet is requested. H. J.
